Aminet CD Database for AmiSearch II
-----------------------------------

This file is my Aminet CD database for
AmiSearch II. All CDs are here, from
1 to 19, except the CD 2 because I don't
have it.

You can use this file is you have difficulties
to create your own base (but you should not,
as it is very easy to create a base) or if you
don't want to waste time creating this base.

Have fun with AmiSearch II !
