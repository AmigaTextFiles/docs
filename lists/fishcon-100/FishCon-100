Berserk         This animation, unveiled at the September 87 meeting
                of the First Amiga Users Group, got Leo a standing ovation.
                It is a "must see" for every Amiga user, and ranks up
                there with "Juggler" as a premier demo for the Amiga.

Conman          Extremely useful replacement for the standard console
                handler, that provides line editing and command line
                histories completely transparent to any application program
                that uses CON: windows.  This program is shareware, and well
                worth a donation to the author.  Version 1.0, binary only.

MicroSPELL      MicroSPELL is a standalone spelling checker which scans
                text files and reports on misspelled words.  It has a 1000
                word "common word" list, a 43,000 word main dictionary, and
                supports multiple user dictionaries.  Also interfaces quite
                nicely with MicroEMACS 3.9, with an emacs macro to step
                through the source file, stopping at each suspect word and
                allowing the user to dispose of it in different ways.

Midi            A midi library and utilities set.  This looks like a
                very complete package, though I have no way of testing
                anything since I have no midi hardware.  The midi utilities
                include a midi monitor to display incoming midi messages
                to the console, a routing utility, a midi library status
                utility, and more.  Also includes source.

============================ README.list 104 ============================
This is disk 104 of the freely distributable AMIGA software library.

This disk contains a copy of Glenn Everhart's large and powerful
spreadsheet program called AnalytiCalc, submitted to me directly by
Glenn for inclusion in the library.  The remainder of this file
is Glenn's "Abstract.txt" file that describes AnalytiCalc.
Source and documentation is included on the disk in arc'd form because
it otherwise would not all fit on the disk.

====================

        AnalytiCalc Abstract:

        AnalytiCalc is a large and powerful spreadsheet program with
sufficient extra features to have some pretentions of acting as an
"integrated system". It is a virtual memory system supporting up to
18000 columns and 18000 rows, multiple equations per cell, an outlining
system, built-in cell annotation, and datafile access from any cell(s)
of the sheet, plus an array of functions not present in most commercial
spreadsheets. This disk represents the initial Amiga port of AnalytiCalc,
and as such the console interface is somewhat crude and in addition requires
use of a custom keymap (one such is supplied) for sensible operation. This
will be improved upon, but meanwhile the program is released with complete
sources, documents, and executables. The graphics program and the DIF
file access program are not yet ported; these will be released when
they are ready. AnalytiCalc for the Amiga uses files compatible with those
for AnalytiCalc on MS-DOS, VMS, or RSX-11M or IAS. An example project
planner spreadsheet is included in the distribution to show off some of
the things you can do. More example sheets will be forthcoming in the
future. AnalytiCalc also supports matrix math, FFTs, infinite windowing,
linear regression, date arithmetic, internal and external macros, LOTS
of cell addressing modes, goal seeking in up to 8 dimensions, and more.

        AnalytiCalc requires perhaps 600K of RAM memory, at least one
360K diskette drive, and AmigaDOS 1.2, plus a larger than default stack.
Display sizes supported can be up to 132 characters wide by up to 76
lines long. Sorry; I don't think AnalytiCalc supports proportional
fonts very well, though it should manage not to be totally brain damaged
with them. The manual requires an 80 column printer.
        To see the documentation you need either a printer 80 columns wide
to print it, or an 80 column screen to view it on.

        SOME DO-NOT'S

        1.  DO NOT use AnalytiCalc until you have read the documentation.

        2.  DO NOT forget to make regular backup copies of your database.

        3.  DO NOT exit (X) the progam without saving your work if you
            want it saved. (You will be asked to confirm you really want
            to leave, however.)







PAGE 84 
        GETTING STARTED.

        If you haven't already printed the documentation, please do so
        before trying to operate AnalytiCalc. Then, READ IT!  You should
        also make sure that you have placed a "write-protect" tab on your
        AnalytiCalc distribution diskettes, so that they can't be
        accidentally erased or overwritten.

        You should now make a copy of your AnalytiCalc disks.  These will
        also serve as your "run-time" system diskettes.

        De-archive AnalyExe.Arc and AnalyDoc.Arc at least onto a blank
        disk and read the document files and release notes. You'll need
        a bit of AmigaDos familiarity to set things up (read how to use
        the ASSIGN command and the SETMAP command and ASSIGN something as
        DK:; also set your stack large with the STACK command.) If you
        are using disk file memory, FACC is a good thing to use also. PLEASE
        READ THE MANUALS though, to save us all a lot of headaches.

        SOME MAXIMUMS AND MINIMUMS.
             Minimum RAM Memory required .....................about  600K
             Minimum Disk Drives required...............................1

        DISCLAIMER.

        In no event will the Author be liable to you for any damages,
        including any lost profits, lost savings or other incidental or
        consequential dmages arising out of the use of or inability to use
        these programs, even if the Author has been advised of the
        possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any other party.

        THE USER-SUPPORTED CONCEPT.

                               User-Supported Software
           You are encouraged to copy and share this program with others.
             If after evaluating this program you find it to be useful,
                         I trust you to send a $10.00 payment.

To Be Done:
Future plans for AnalytiCalc:
        1. Add TAN, ASIN, ACOS, and 2-argument ATAN (one argument ATAN
        is present now). (Done in VAX version; trivial mod.)
        2. Interface to raw: device instead of con: device and add more
        flexible parsing of keystrokes so custom keymaps can be junked.
        3. Allow data files to be on a logical device. (Actually, FACC
        may make this need obsolete).
        4. Minor cleanups to XQTCMD and a couple other places to clean
        up and more thoroughly bullet proof the code.
        5. Fix bugs as they are discovered.
        6. Allow use on non-interlaced screens by redoing the two command
        and display windows as pseudo-requestors.

Auxiliary files:
        1. Port DIFDB (DIF to database or AnalytiCalc saved format and
        back converter) to Amiga.
        2. Port PCGRAF to Amiga.
        3. Port some of the BASIC graphics packages to Amiga. Possibly
        compile some of them.
        4. Supply the Business Expense Report, manpower planner, and
        income tax templates as extra examples. Possibly do a game of 
        LIFE template too, just for fun.

Other programs:
        Port the RIM relational DBMS to Amiga as a companion piece. (This
        has already been done porting from CDC to VAX to MSDOS (the last
        by me), and should be straightforward).

I have found that Absoft Fortran 2.3 is a stable and usable compiler and
would like to acknowledge gratefully its contribution. He who wants to
add to or modify AnalytiCalc needs Absoft Fortran 2.3 (or later, I suppose)
to build it with. Anyone who has Absoft Fortran-020 for the 68020 is
invited to recompile this program to use the faster chips. I didn't have
either money or machine to try a 68020/68881 version, but see no reason
why it would fail.

Pdc             An optimizing C compiler for the 68000 processor.  This
                is an update to the version first released on disk 53,
                though apparently not based on the code from that disk.
                Major porting work was done by Jeff Lydiatt to get it to
                the point where it would compile and execute simple programs
                on the Amiga.  This version now generates metacomco-
                compatible assembler source code, which can be assembled by
                the assembler also provided on this disk and then linked by
                the freely redistributable linker "blink" (also provided).
                Includes all compiler source and some library and startup
                source code.  Requires amiga.lib from developers kit to
                generate complete running example executables.

Berserk         This animation, unveiled at the September 87 meeting
                of the First Amiga Users Group, got Leo a standing ovation.
                It is a "must see" for every Amiga user, and ranks up
                there with "Juggler" as a premier demo for the Amiga.

                The difference between this distribution, and the one
                on disk 100, is that this one includes "source".  I.E.
                it contains all the object descriptions necessary to
                recreate the animation.  Thus you can, if you like,
                try modifying various objects to create slightly
                different animations, or use it as an example for
                creating your own animations.

                Seldom does a disk get devoted to a single program,
                however animation is one of the Amiga's greatest
                strengths, and I felt it was appropriate to have at
                least one animation that was available at the
                "source code" level.

CrcLists        Complete CRC check files for disks 129-141 and disks
                143-145 of the library, using the crc program from
                disk 133.  These were made directly from my master
                disks.  Disk 142 is omitted because of a problem
                with the crc program.

MG-2b
 This disk contains the latest version of MicroGNUEmacs (MG 2b).  Many
 additions and enhancements since the original works by Dave Conroy.  A
 large amount of credit should go to the vast number of contributors and
 Beta testers.

 *Note: In order to fit all of the files on one disk and preserve the
       Workbench environment, the machine specific source code files
       and the document files have been archived.  An executable copy
       of the public domain archive program "Zoo" has been placed in
       the "c" directory for the convenience of those who may not
       already have it.

Keep            A nice little utility program with an intuition interface
                for BBS and network junkies who download messages in one 
                large file and then read them off-line.  Using only the
                mouse, you can drive through such files a message at a 
                time, examine each at your leisure and tag those you wish
                to keep.  Source available with donation to author.
                Version 1.2, binary only.

                also print the current file.  Very useful!
                Version 1.3, an update to the version
                on disk number 92.  Includes source.
