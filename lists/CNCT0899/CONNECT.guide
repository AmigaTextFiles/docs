                          @{b}@{u}I N T R O D U C T I O N@{ub}@{uu}

Welcome to the Sixth Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is a Monthly
UK BBS Scene Magazine containing a comprehensive UK BBS Directory.

Many SysOps have tried their hands at generating up-to-date BBS Lists, but
most have found them too difficult to maintain and have abandoned updating
them, with the exception of the odd few, like Turbo D at @{BG fill}@{"Alpha Zone BBS" Link AlphaZoneBBS}@{BG background}
who has for the last 9 months supplied a list of BBS Numbers to the AMINET.

However, most BBS Lists contain BBS Numbers of BBSes that have long since
left the scene, and of all the Lists we have encountered, there hasn't
been one that has been accurately up-to-date.

At the time of going to press, ALL the BBSes listed in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} have
been 100% verified as being online.  We have spent the last 7 months
ringing BBS Numbers to find out which BBSes are still online, and to find
out those that have left the scene.  We have still a lot of work to do,
but I'm sure you can appreciate the cost of dialling every BBS Number we
have found in the afore mentioned BBS Lists, and that is why we need YOUR
help in providing us with information of any BBSes you know that are still
online, that are not listed in this Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

Furthermore, we need YOUR help in keeping @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} up-to-date with BBS
Closures, New Numbers, Relaunches, Renames etc.  For more details on how
to contact us, access @{BG fill}@{"Submissions" Link Submissions}@{BG background}.

The BBS Scene is in bad need of positive publicity...and we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
strongly believe that BBS Advertising is a damn good start.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
aims to provide the AMIGA Community with a central resource of information
regarding the current status of the UK BBS Scene, with the added bonus of a
comprehensive UK BBS Directory every month.

When we first researched for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to find out just how many BBSes
were still up and running, we were pleasantly suprised by the number we
found were still online, and those 124 BBSes we found, were entered into
the First Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  That 124 BBSes has now grown to 193 BBSes
for the Sixth Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, just proving that the UK BBS Scene is
far from dead, as was first thought. 

From our point of view, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has really made a difference to the
number of Calls and New Users at our respective BBSes, and many of our New
Users had never been on a BBS before in their lives, the Internet, yes, but
never a BBS, as they thought that BBSes were extinct.  Feedback from other
SysOps who advertised in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} suggests that they have experienced the
same result, which proves a point, that SysOps should not just sit back and
accept the number of Users in their User-Base, but should advertise their
BBSes as much as possible, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} giving them that very chance.

AMIGA FORMAT Magazine recently started a column for BBS Numbers in their
Readers Adverts section, and those that have advertised, including
ourselves, have found that advertising DOES work, and that there ARE
members of the AMIGA Community who want to call BBSes, but never knew
where to get in contact with them!  Therefore in respect of all you SysOps
that think that advertising is a waste of time...we rest our case!!!

The Internet has done much damage to the UK BBS Scene, especially when Free
ISPs were launched, but that damage is not irrepairable, as we have proven,
and ironically @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has used the Internet to get to it's prospective
audience, to get Internet Users back to the UK BBS Scene, and it appears to
have worked, and worked well.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been well received from SysOps and BBS Users alike, and the
Correspondence we have received from Readers has been tremendous.  We
honestly didn't believe that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would be so popular, and its
thanks to your input and feedback that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has established itself
as the leading UK BBS Scene Magazine after only it's Fifth Issue!!!

Plans to take @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}' coverage beyond the United Kingdom are already
under consideration.  Work on @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has already started, but
we foresee a problem that really needs to be addressed before we continue
any further with the project.  Basically, does the UK BBS Scene really want
an International BBS Directory?  If the answer to this questions is "Yes",
then how do we market it?  Do we release it seperately, to give YOU the
choice whether you want to Download it or not, or do we include it within
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, bearing in mind the Archive Size will probably double?

Please help us to make this decision, get in touch with us at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text},
and let us know what YOU want.  If we get no response from YOU, as Readers
of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then the @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} project will be scrapped!!!

Please keep the Correspondence coming, we would especially like to hear from
SysOps who have advertised their BBSes in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and have benefitted
as a result.  Also, if any of you have any ideas on how we can improve the
content of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, or if you have anything at all to contribute to
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then please get in touch, even if you only have a sentence or
two to say, ALL Correspondence will be read and replied to, and may even
get included in the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!

See you Next Issue...

@{u}CoNnEcTiOnS At The World Of Amiga Show 1999@{uu}

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} attended the World Of Amiga Show 1999 in Kensington, London,
held July 24th and 25th.  We were hoping to bring you a World Of Amiga Show
1999 Report in this Issue, but due to the fact that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been
busy, not only attending the World Of Amiga Show 1999, but also building
@{BG fill}@{"Kerry-Oot BBS" Link KerryOotBBS}@{BG background} in Glasgow, and the fact that this Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is
already behind schedule, we will unfortunately not be able to bring you the
promised World Of Amiga Show 1999 Report this Issue.  However, we will
hopefully bring you a World Of Amiga Show 1999 Report in Issue Seven of
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} out WEDNESDAY 1ST SEPTEMBER!

                             @{u}A Word From Dunkie@{uu}

Welcome to Issue Six of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  This month hasn't been the best of
months for the UK BBS Scene, with @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} regretably reporting 9 BBS
Closures since last Issue.  Only 2 out of these 9 BBS Closures were down to
Hardware Failure, the remaining 7 sighted the lack of Calls to their BBSes
as the main reason for closure.  So...did these SysOps do everything they
possibly could to get the Callers in, and aid the survival of their BBSes?
NO!!!  Only 2 out of these 7 BBS Closures actually bothered to advertise in
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and the remaining 2 BBS Closures due to Hardware Failure, have
also never bothered to advertise in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, so when these eventually
re-open, who is going to know that they have indeed re-opened if they don't
advertise in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}?

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} was at the World Of Amiga Show 1999, held July 24th and 25th, in
Kensington, London.  There I had the chance to meet and speak to Ben Vost
(Editor Of AMIGA FORMAT) in person about AMIGA FORMAT's support for the UK
BBS Scene.  Not many of you will be aware of this, but it was only through
my constant bending of Nick Veitch's (Ex-Editor Of AMIGA FORMAT) and Ben
Vost's ears over the phone, that AMIGA FORMAT started their FREE BBS ADVERTS
column.  However, despite achieving this marvellous result for the UK BBS
Scene, Ben Vost informed me that I was the only person who contacts him
regarding the UK BBS Scene, and that very few SysOps have taken up the offer
of FREE Advertising in AMIGA FORMAT.  The current Issue of AMIGA FORMAT is
witness to this fact, with only 16 BBSes actually advertising in the
Magazine, including our own @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background} and @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}!!!  What kind of
image does this represent to Ben Vost, let alone the 14,644 Readers of AMIGA
FORMAT, about the UK BBS Scene?

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} believes that "NO PUBLICITY IS BAD PUBLICITY", and I feel rather
saddened that my hard work in bringing the UK BBS Scene back to people's
attention appears to be wasted.  The Internet maybe doing the UK BBS Scene
some real damage, but it's the SysOps who are really sticking the knife into
the back of the UK BBS Scene, by not actively promoting and supporting it.
I spoke to a few SysOps at the World Of Amiga Show 1999, and their carefree
attitude astounded me, most could not be bothered to advertise, but all were
complaining about the lack of Calls they were getting to their respective
BBSes!!!  This kind of attitude seems to be widespread through the UK BBS
Scene, and it's this kind of attitude that, honestly, makes my blood boil!!!
What's the point of SysOps moaning about their lack of Calls, if they're
not prepared to do something about it?  SysOps seem to think that if they
sit on their butts long enough, someone else like @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, will do all
the hard work for them, and their situation will improve.  IT WON'T!!!

SysOps are going to have to start helping themselves, if the UK BBS Scene is
to survive.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has given them that chance, and now after 6 Issues,
surely SysOps must realise that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is not just a flash-in-the-pan
publication, and that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} can and does achieve results.  SysOps who
advertise in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} are witness to this fact, you only have to read
previous Issues' Correspondence and Articles to know this.  So...my message
to SysOps, is that you are going to have to start meeting @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} half-
way, I cannot keep justifying £300+ phone bills, checking where your BBSes
are located.  It's a darn sight easier for you to find @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, than it
is for ME to find YOU...and if I can't find you...then neither can potential
Callers to your BBS.  Dwell on this thought...I feel I've done everything I
possibly can to aid the UK BBS Scene, it's now up to YOU to work with me,
rather than work against me!!!

See you Next Issue...

                              @{u}A Word From Pete@{uu}

Welcome to Issue Six of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  Every New User that calls @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}
has to fill out a questionnaire, so that I can keep track of how well both
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} and any other BBS Advertising I have, is achieving results:-

(Q) Where did you get the number for this BBS?
(A) From the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Magazine.

(Q) Give me the name and number of another BBS that you call?
(A) Can't mate...never been on a BBS before.

Well this has been the case for 5 New Users I had in a week, and I find it
hard to believe that there are still people out there that HAVE NEVER been
on a BBS before.  Yet we all know where they HAVE been...yep...on the
Internet, the place that is devouring poor old BBSes one by one.  As SysOps,
we know that we can't hope to compete with the Internet on an equal footing,
but surely we can make a better fight of it than what we are doing at the
present!!!  When the idea for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} was first conceived, we knew that
people would think that it would be a nine-day-wonder, and would cease after
a couple of Issues, but here we are issuing another and bigger edition than
ever, hoping to attract those people, like the ones above, that have never
been on a BBS before.

What we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} did expect was a better feedback from SysOps, telling
us if the Magazine had helped to increase their User base and number of
Calls, but sadly only a few have taken the time to drop us a line.  So how
are we supposed to know if @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is working for the UK BBS Scene, if
people can't be bothered to give us feedback...so come on guys, let's try
and prolong the UK BBS Scene for a few more years, let us have your views,
on the UK BBS Scene, whatever they may be!!!  Also we need your ASCII (Text)
Adverts for your BBSes...time is running out!!!  There are 9 BBSes this
month that have finally closed down because of a lack of Calls.  How many
will it be next month?
 
See you Next Issue...

   @{u}The BBS Scene - By Philippa Armstong "Pipa" (SysOp Of Dark Domain BBS)@{uu}

I have been on the BBS Scene for 6 years now, and have seen a lot of
change.  @{BG fill}@{"Dark Domain BBS" Link DarkDomainBBS}@{BG background} was started in 1993, back then there was a lot
of people on the BBS Scene, the BBS got a lot of Calls, and I didn't really
have to do much to get the Calls...BUT...things have changed!!!

I have sat here for months now, hoping that I would get some Callers to
@{BG fill}@{"Dark Domain BBS" Link DarkDomainBBS}@{BG background}, and the result was no Callers at all!!!  I decided it was
time to change that, and the way to change it was by advertising, and
advertising in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} was the way to go about it!!!  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} keeps
you in touch with all of the BBSes that are still running, and it lets you
speak your view and read what other people have to say, about the BBS Scene.

Waiting around for other people to call you won't work at all, you need
to get out there, make a few Calls yourself, and get involved with the BBS
Community.  Don't just sit back and hope that people will call you...THEY
WON'T!!!  I thought the BBS Scene was dead...but I was wrong.  Until
recently I didn't call anybody, then I started calling other SysOps, and
only then did I realise how many BBSes there were still running.  I started
advertising, and now Callers to @{BG fill}@{"Dark Domain BBS" Link DarkDomainBBS}@{BG background} have picked up again :)

My point is, that I've found that the only way to keep the BBS Scene going,
is for us SysOps to join in with the BBS Community and advertise our BBSes,
but remember...you have to put something into the BBS Community, to get
things back from it!!!

   @{u}Dave's Ramblings - By Dave Clarke (Web-Master Of CoNnEcTiOnS Web-Site)@{uu}

Hello @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers...

My name is Dave Clarke, and no doubt you are all asking "Who the hell is
that?".  Well at the moment I'm slowly constructing "The Clarke Site" at
http://home.freeuk.net/davecl which is also the home of the First Official
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site, but in the past I have had a hand in making Dunkie the
man he is today (please don't kill me, I have a wife and kids :-)).

It was me that encouraged him to get an AMIGA, which I had at that time,
then I persuaded him to get a Hard-Drive and a Modem, neither of which he
thought he needed, then we helped each other set up BBS Software, but
unfortunately I was unable to go down this path, but Dunkie just went from
strength to strength, making @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background} the excellent BBS it is today!!!
I'm sure Sarah must hate me when I think about all the time and money that
Dunkie spends on his beloved AMIGA and @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}, but we all need a hobby
and there are many worse things he could be doing.

Anyway, after my flirtings with my own BBS, I became a point off Bedlam BBS
in Leeds (now closed) and was the self-appointed Moderator of BED_FILTH,
which was not as you are thinking all about nude ladies, but was a general
chat area but with a slant, profanity, vulgarity, cursing and general
swearing were positively encouraged, indeed one of the rules was that your
message had to contain at least 2 swear words.  All this sounds very silly
now, but it was great fun at the time.  I also tried my hand at a bit of 3D 
Rendering, and one of my pics appeared on the back cover of AMIGA SHOPPER
Magazine.

All good things must come to an end, and due to personal and financial
problems, the trusty AMIGA A1200 had to go :(  This was about 2 years ago
and I thought my world had ended.  After spending a good 25-30 hours a week
(sometimes more) on the computer, I suddenly found I had nothing to do.
When finances allowed I got a Playstation, and although good for a quick
game or two it just wasn't the same, I hankered for a real computer.

In January of this year, I took the plunge, and as the AMIGA was to all
intents and purposes dead, I bought a PC (on the tick, not paid for and
probably never will be).  Of course during my absence BBSes have taken a
back-seat and the Internet is at the forefront, so rather than mess around
with BBS Software, I messed around with Web-Creators and when Dunkie asked
me if I wanted to help with @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, I jumped at the chance and the rest
as they say is history.

The BBS Scene is NOT dead as everybody thought, it is very much alive and
kicking, and I will be doing what I can to support it. It is much more
personal and enjoyable than the faceless Internet.  When you log-on to a BBS
you are logging on (in most cases) to a computer in someone's home, the
computer that they use and tend everyday, and a lot of the time they are sat 
watching what you are doing, ready to jump in and help if you get stuck or
to chat to you when you want (or even if you don't want...eh Dunkie?).  The
growth of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is testimony to the BBS Scene, and to the dedication
of SysOps and Co-SysOps like Dunkie and Sarah, who will not let it die.

Long live BBSes!!!

Jesus what a load of waffle I've written, Dunkie only wanted a few lines,
I'm getting as bad as him.  Thanks for reading my inane ramblings...

Cya...

           @{u}Dying In The Web - By Hologram (SysOp Of Gravity BBS)@{uu}

With the Internet so accessible as it is, BBSes are becoming a thing of
yesterday.  Internet Chat, Internet Meetings, E-Mail, Newsgroups, FTP Sites
etc, have replaced the humble things we as SysOps have been providing on a
16-Colour ANSI-Terminal all these years.  Everyone I speak to, regardless of
their walk of life, bank balance or Computer Hardware, appear to share the
same opinion.  So...why am I a SysOp?

Well...I for one enjoy the one-to-one approach to SysOp-User, and basically
just enjoy fiddling about with my machine for the sake of it.  My Computer
needs are small-time, which is why I have stuck with my AMIGA for so long.
The AMIGA is such a lovely machine and much friendlier and easier to use
than the Bill Gates-inflicted systems of today, but let's face it, it's
behind the times in power and add-on Hardware accessibility.

So my BBS-running and dialling is a hobby.  It keeps me in touch with the
Locals as it were, and basically gives me some Mail to look forward to in
my sad little life, without having to dial out for it.

But for the masses of SysOps, it's now become too much hard work trying to
compete with the Internet.  What is the point of trying to maintain an
up-to-the-minute Filebase for people to use, knowing that several billions
have access to that same up-to-the-minute Filebase from anywhere in the
world on the Internet?  Those who enjoy design, and wish to share their
interests to the world, simply run their own Web-Site and upload to it what
they wish.  Am I sounding over-negative here?

I think my approach is realistic.  I have enjoyed running @{BG fill}@{"Gravity BBS" Link GravityBBS}@{BG background} in
Southampton for some time, until the Users dwindled and I finally had Modem
and Hardware problems, resulting in losing the entire BBS on my Hard-Drive.

@{BG fill}@{"Gravity BBS" Link GravityBBS}@{BG background} is currently being re-instated and updated, and I do so because
my time is filled with little else, and I want to support the people around
me, who are my friends, in running the PowerNet Mail Network, and giving my
contribution.

I would love to see BBSes back in business in a theoretical sense.  I think
they add a certain personal touch in computing and the Communications Scene
in general, when you are actively participating in someone elses hard work
and design, by giving their BBS a call and appreciating it.

But let's be realistic.  What can we SysOps do besides plug-plug-plug our
BBSes, to make our BBSes tempting and attractive to people?  What can we
do with 16-Colour ANSI, to persuade people to move from Technicolor HTML?
What can we make that is special on our single-tasking BBS, to persuade
people to use it over multi-tasking Web-Viewing, File Transfer, and Mail
Sending systems that people are using today?

At the end of the day, the success of my own BBS is not tantamount to the
progress of my life.  Hell, if no-one uses it, there are umpteen things I
can fill my Hard-Drive space with.  But if BBSes as a whole fade, then I do
see it as a sad passing of a very good era.

POWERNET is a *NEW* up and coming Echo-Mailnet to hit your screens, with
JUST a few months of running, we have managed to persuade many people to
connect a feed.  This Mailnet has 9 Mail Sections, hopefully to cater for
ALL your mailing needs.

POWERNET was specifically designed to have an anything goes attitude, there
are NO Moderators stamping on your toes at every opportunity.

We also have a Web-Site to compliment POWERNET, designed by my Co-SysOp,
Co-Founder and Nodelist Co-Ordinator, Chris Biggs (SysOp Of Hellfire BBS).
The POWERNET Web-Site can be found at:-

http://www.power-net.freeserve.co.uk

OUR AIM is to offer as many feeds to POWERNET as possible, giving POWERNET
the chance to grow and prosper.  We are aiming to put POWERNET on the market
as THE PLACE to be and where ALL the ACTION is.

ALSO, FREE (Yes...I said FREE) Adverts of YOUR BBS on our POWERNET Web-Site.
This service will be of NO cost to you, all we ask is JOIN TODAY!!!

In addition to your BBS Advert being added to our POWERNET Web-Site, we
will also add a link to your Web-Site (If Applicable).  This Advert service
will add support to YOUR BBS and Web-Site...

"@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is great...there are loads of BBSes in there that I never knew
existed!!!  I think it's great what you're doing, and my BBS has picked up
since you helped me :)))"

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is pleased to hear that yet again, we've delivered the goods,
and like we promised, @{BG fill}@{"Dark Domain BBS" Link DarkDomainBBS}@{BG background} has picked up since you advertised in
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has obviously convinced YOU, that we can turn
things around for UK BBSes if you advertise in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, it's just the
rest of the UK SysOps we have to convince now!!!  Hopefully Correspondence,
like yours above, will help in our struggle to convince SysOps to advertise
their BBSes.  Its constructive Correspondence like yours that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
welcomes, and we're sure that you are not alone in benefitting from the
effects of advertising in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  If there are any SysOps out there,
who HAVE benefitted from advertising in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then please get in
touch.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} needs YOUR help, if we are to overcome this mountain
we have to climb to ensure the UK BBS Scene's survival.  Thanks again!!!

"@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is an excellent idea!!!  It's true what you say about the
Internet taking the Callers away, but I feel that Users will be back, as the
BBS Scene gives you a 1-2-1 touch, which the Internet doesn't really do.  I
used to have loads of people logging-on everyday, but I only average now one
User a day :(  I do kick myself really, as I don't really advertise my BBS.
Hopefully @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} will help.  It's good to know someone is out there to
help...keep up the good work!!!"

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would aid you better m8, if you were to submit an ASCII (Text)
Advert for Hellfire BBS.  For example, if you had submitted an Advert for
this Issue, your BBS would have been linked to your Correspondence, like the
previous Correspondence above, and would have drawn Readers' attention more
so than just your SysOp Name and BBS underneath your Correspondence.  We
hope you'll take notice of this fact, and submit your BBS Advert in time for
the next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

"In the last 2 years of running a BBS, I have found the BBS Scene starting
to become a thing of the past.  Well I personally think we can revive the
BBS Scene with the help and support of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  It is certainly a
breath of fresh air, to see someone with the noddle to start something as
kewl as @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, to give us SysOps a chance in running a successful and
prosperous Bulletin Board System.  Nice one guys...keep up the good work!!!"

 +-----------------+ TELEPHONE (01670) 812192 / +44-1670-812192.

 Very generous BBS...You have 255 minutes of online time per day/per call

       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       | The CIRCLE BBS online times and calling information:       |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       | Monday -> Thursday : 00:00 -> 07:00 hrs  : NORMAL DIALLING |
       |                                                            |
       | ALL OTHER TIMES    : The BBS uses RINGBACK (see below).    |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+

       (Normal dialling means:- just call as you would any other BBS)

 USING THE CIRCLE BBS RINGBACK:

 Call the BBS and let the phone ring once, immediately HANG UP.
 Wait 15-20 seconds for the BBS to be loaded.
 Call the BBS again and you'll be connected.
 Please don't just call it as normal - I'll think it's a voice call
 and you'll hear "Hello?" through your modem speaker! ;)
