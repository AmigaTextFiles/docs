@node "important" "Important"

 This will be the last version of this list from me. I don't have  the
 time and I can't motivate myself to update this list regularly.

 If someone else wants to take over the list - just contact me.

 I only expect that my name will appear somewhere in the list and that
 it will stay "contributionware" or "freeware".

 I still have MANY tests from other people  which  I  didn't  include,
 yet.  So  I  think I will send ALL the tests I received (from Version
 1.0 on (of course archived with LZX)) to the one who  wants  to  take
 over the list.

@node "Why" "Why this list?"

 Why this list?
 --------------
 
 You may know that there are not too much games especially written for
 the  Amiga.  Or  think that there are about 40 or 50 new games for PC
 per month, but only 1 or 2 will ever be converted. The Macintosh game
 scene is far from being complete but some very good games will always
 be converted to the Mac.
 
 So why not using SHAPESHIFTER to run the  Macintosh-games  that  will
 never  be  available  for  Amiga-players?  Here is the problem: Is my
 hardware good enough to play this game?
 
 So I'm trying to collect as  much  information  as  possible  on  the
 subject: What game needs what kind of hardware (RAM, processor)?
 
 The version 1.0 of this list consisted only of *my* own games.  Since
 V1.1 there are *many* tests from @{"other" link "Helfer"0} people.

@node "legal" "Legal Stuff"

 Legal stuff
 -----------
 
 I can't be held responsible if you buy a  game  because  I  wrote  it
 works and it doesn't work on your machine !!!
 
 Use this information at your own risk!!!
 
 If you want to copy this list make  sure  that  you  copy  the  whole
 directory because there are some "invisible" files!

 THIS LIST IS FROM VERSION 1.7 ON FREEWARE!

 *My* games have been tested on:
 
 - Amiga 4000/040
 - Cyberstorm 040/40MHz
 - Cybervision 64/2MB
 - CGX V3.0 R66
 - 20MB FastRAM
 -  2MB ChipRAM
 - Kick and WB 3.0
 - MacOS 7.5.5
 - 1MB Mac-ROM
 - 14,4XSpeed CD-ROM drive (SCSI)
 - 260 MB Seagate AT HD on internal IDE
 - Commodore A2091-SCSI with GURU-ROM V6
 - internal HD-Floppy
 - Eizo 17"-Monitor (64kHz)


 Shapeshifter has been used in the latest version 3.8.

@node "need" "What you need..."

 What you need to play games on Shapeshifter:

 Note that most of these games have been tested with a graphics-board.
 I  think  that  having  a  Cybervision  (or some other GFX board with
 chunky-to-planar GFX conversion built-in) is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
 TO  HAVE  if  you  are  going  to  run  Shapeshifter. The second most
 important thing would be an accelerated  processor  with  local  ram.
 (Either  Cyberstorm,  Warp Engine, or even the old Excalibur) Finally
 -I've found that a faster CD-ROM and faster Hard Drive can go a  long
 way  towards  speeding  up the Mac side. (I now use a Micropolis 4221
 for the Mac side; It spins at 7200 rpm, has a 512K cache,  and  gives
 me  6 megs per second sustained on the Amiga side... That helps a lot
 on the Mac side.)

<Adam Burns>


To keep it together:

To run most (68k-)Macintosh-Games fast enough I recommend:

- 16 MB FastRAM (you should have at least 8 MB RAM for Shapeshifter)
- a Graphics-board like Cybervision64 or Picasso
- Kickstart 3.1 speeds up the emulation a little bit
- a 68040 with 25MHz (the faster the better!)
- of course in many cases you could also use a 68020 with 14MHz or
  above  but  it's no fun playing games with such a "slow" processor!
- a fast (SCSI) Hard Drive
- a fast (SCSI!) CD-ROM Drive (4X and above)

  Many thanks !!!! Vielen Dank !!! Merci !!!

  Without so much user's help I would not be able to create such a great
  list. And it would not grow (because I cannot afford to buy many games).


  Remark: I got very much tests for this release. But most of them
  didn't use the new format (as introduced in V1.5 (see Frankenstein)).
  So I did not include them in THIS release. I kept them so I will
  send them all together to the person who wants to take over the list.

@node "future" "Future"

What will come in the future?

 At first: At this time I can't motivate myself to do it any further.
 Maybe in a few months... Or I will do it completely different (and then
 maybe as "fusioncomplist".

 - I think I will port the List to HTML-format. So I could send it to
   Mac-Magazines for their CD-ROMs.

 - Many more games-tests.

 - All tests in the new format (like "Frankenstein")
