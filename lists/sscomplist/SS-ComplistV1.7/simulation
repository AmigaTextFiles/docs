@node "a10" "A10 Attack"

A10 Attack 
runs fast.  A bit sluggish on 030.  Came on CD.
Tested on: Amiga 3000, Cybervision 64, Cyberstorm 060 50MHz, 
64MB FastRAM, 2MB ChipRAM, Apple CD300 2xSpeed CD-ROM

Tip für Leute mit deutscher Tastaturbelegung: wenn das Spiel nicht
"funktioniert", sollte man die Tastaturbelegung auf US einstellen.
Dann sollte es keine Probleme mehr geben.

@node "alunser" "Al Unser Jr. Arcade Racing"

 Al Unser Jr. Racing: I bought this, but it was BEFORE I had the  Warp
 Engine,  and it was so slow then as to be totally unplayable. (I only
 had a stock 3640 card that came with the A4000/040, though I did have
 the  Cybervision  already.) I decided to take it back, because I just
 couldn't see how it was going to get much better, even with the  Warp
 Engine. But it did work.

Tested on: A4000 with Macro-System's WARP ENGINE '040 running at 40 Mhz
Cybervision-64 (4-meg)
Toshiba 6.7 speed SCSI-II CD-ROM
Amiga OS 3.1

@node "chuck" "Chuck Yeager's Air Combat"

 Chuck Yeager's Air Combat: Works in 16 color mode on  a  stock  '040,
 runs great in full-color mode on an accelerated '040.

Chuck Yeager's Air Combat:  Flight Simulator.  Fly World War II and Vietnam
War era planes in realistic dogfights against classic German and soviet
planes.  Very basic graphics.  Realistic flight controls, different
performance specs for each plane, totally configurable missions.  Almost
limitless possible missions.  Not very easy to fly from the keyboard, but
it's possible.  Published by Electronic Arts.

Tested on: A4000 with Macro-System's WARP ENGINE '040 running at 40 Mhz
Cybervision-64 (4-meg)
Toshiba 6.7 speed SCSI-II CD-ROM
Amiga OS 3.1

@node "hornet" "F/A-18 Hornet"
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Name:            F/A-18 Hornet

 Genre:           Flight Simulator

 Hardware needed: 4MB RAM, 256color-screenmode

 Software needed: System 6.07

 Description:     Very complex. Graphics like those in good-old "Interceptor"
                  but 640X480 or higher.

 Tested on:       A4000, Cyberstorm040/40MHz, Kick/WB3.0, Cybervision64,
                  A2091-SCSI-Controller, Toshiba XM3801B-SCSI-CD-ROM drive,
                  22MB RAM (10MB assigned to Shapeshifter), MacOS 7.5.5,

 Rating:          With 030/25MHz/16MB/Cybervision64 you will have to reduce the
                  displaysize and number of objects.

                  With 040/40MHz/22MB/Cybervision64 it is good playable in 640X480
                  at highest detail-level.

                  Very smooth on A4000/060 even with two monitors.

 Demo available:  Not known.

832X624. At a resolution of 1024X768 you should set the detail-level
down to "High".
