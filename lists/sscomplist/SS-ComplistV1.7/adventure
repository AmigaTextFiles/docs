@node "angeldevoid" "Angel Devoid"

 Angel Devoid: Fantastic! 4 CD's of adventure.  Just  getting  started
 now,  but it runs great! Don't know how it looks on a stock machine -
 I bought this one after I got the Warp Engine, but I  think  it  will
 play  on  stock  '040's - maybe even a fast '030... It is full-screen
 though - no 1/4 screen option like Daedalus Encounter.)

Angel Devoid:  Full-Motion Video Adventure; 4 CD Roms.  You are a Police
Officer of the future who has been tracking a deadly terrorist known as
Angel Devoid.  When you crash while chasing him, he captures you and takes
you to a plastic surgeon who alters your face so that you look like him!
Now you must escape the hospital and find the real  Angel Devoid, while
also fleeing from your own Police buddies, who think that YOU are Angel
Devoid.  Lots of interactive action video sequences, and much of your
sucess depends on how you deal with people you meet, using the "Attitide
Panel".  Published by Mindscape.

Tested on: A4000 with Macro-System's WARP ENGINE '040 running at 40 Mhz

@node "deadalus" "The Deadalus Encounter"

 Daedalus Encounter: It runs on any machine, but the faster the better
 for  some of the arcade sequences. Later in the game, you almost need
 a Warp Engine or a CyberStorm to get past one challenge, since slower
 machines  don't  update  the display fast enough. Still, in 256 color
 mode it is playable on a stock '040 (25 mhz). Much  beter  in  15-bit
 color mode though!

Daedalus Encounter:  Full-Motion Video Adventure; 3 CD Roms.  Over 2 hours
of live-action video.  You and 2 crew mates have crashed your ship into a
large object which is hurtling towards the sun.  The three of you must work
together to stay alive.  Most of the video scenes are not interactive; they
serve to tell the story.  There are some interactive action sequences, but
most of the gameplay revolves around geometric puzzles.  Often you will
need to solve a puzzle to open a door, turn on equipment, etc.  You can
save your game at any time, and multiple saves are strongly recomended.

Dragon's Lair:  Cartoon Video Adventure Game.  Control the actions of Dirk
the Daring as you try to rescue the fair princess from the clutches of an
evil dragon.  100% port of the classic laser-disk game found in arcades in
the middle 1980's.  Gameplay consists of moving the joystick or hitting the
fire button at the proper moment to keep the video playing.  Entirely a
game of rote memorization and trial & error.  Still, if you liked the
arcade version, this is a must-have!  Published by ReadySoft.

@node "ironhelix" "Iron Helix"

 Iron Helix: You can play this on a stock 040, maybe even a fast  030.
 Runs great on the Warp Engine. This one is similar to Skyborg in that
 the pictures are all still-images. You move forward in steps, and the
 picture  dissolves  to  the new viewpoint. (Well, in Iron Helix there
 are a few frames blended to show movement forward; not a bad game)

Iron Helix:  Adventure Game.  You are a robot who has been dispatched to a
ship which has been infected with a deadly virus.  The crew is dead, but
a Doomsday Device, code-named Iron Helix, is still on board.  The ship's
main computer has taken control of the ship and will deploy the Iron Helix
device when the ship reaches it's destination.  You must stop the ship's
computer before this happens, otherwise an intergalactic war will result.
Gameplay consists mostly of exploring the many passageways of the ship
while avoiding the security robot.  Your view is updated with each step,
with a short video segment, but otherwise the display is static.  You must
collect DNA samples from the former crew in order to access various
terminals and doors.  Published by Spectrum Holobyte.

 Skyborg: Runs just fine on the Warp Engine, the action sequences  are
 almost  impossible  on a stock '040 though. Not that much fun - but I
 only paid $25 for it...

SkyBorg:  Adventure Game.  You are a robot who must travel into the
Microcosm, (a miniture universe where time is greatly accelerated) to
rescue your builder, Dr. Barton.  On the way, another robot, Morb, who was
also built by Dr. Barton, will be trying to stop you.  Morb has been
malfunctioning, and is no longer sane.  Gameplay is slow.  Your view of the
surroundings is not updated in real-time; rather, each time you take a step
a new view is loaded.  With very few interactive action sequences, this game
is mostly about finding all the pieces you need to get your ship working,
and flying around the planets of the Microcosm untill you find Dr. Barton.

Runs much faster than the Amiga-AGA-version on:
A1200/1230IV/18MB RAM/AGA-EVD-driver

@node "starjudg" "Star Trek Judgment Rites"

It's a bit slow..but playable but you'd really need a 040 CPU
to have fun. The animations are slow on 030 and the sound, well,
forget about the sound. :)

Tested on: A4000/030, EGS-Spectrum, 16MB RAM
