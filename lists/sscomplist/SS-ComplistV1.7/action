@node "havoc" "Havoc"

 Havoc: Playable on a stock 040 with reduced GFX and screen  size.  On
 an  accelerated  machine  you  can  bump  up the size and some of the
 detail, but max resolution and max detail slows it to  a  crawl  even
 with a 40 Mhx Warp Engine. Maybe an '060 would handle it though...

Havoc:  Tank Shoot-em-up.  Fly your hovercraft close to the ground and blow
up everything in your path.  Lots of action.  The game has very good
texture-mapped backgrounds, but you need a VERY FAST machine to take
advantage of this.  Game also has provisions for playing head-to-head via
modem.  Many different missions, several different types of battle
hovercraft.  Published by Reality Bytes.

Tested on: A4000 with Macro-System's WARP ENGINE '040 running at 40 Mhz

@node "jump" "Jump Raven"

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Name:            Jump Raven 

 Genre:           Action

 Hardware needed: Color Macintosh, Color Monitor, CD-Rom, 
                  8MB Ram (6MB Free) were noted on the CD

 Software needed: System 7.0 maybe even 6.0

 Description:     It`s mainly an Actiongame, were you control a high-tech
                  car and fly it through a city.
                  You can equip your car with various forms of weapons 
                  to kill your enemies.
                  Some jobs can be given over to your computer-Player, 
                  so that you can either choose to drive/fly/aim weapons
                  or even combine some of those .
                  The hole game is "pseudo"-3D which means that you can 
                  change your view only about 90 degrees.
                  But your enemies grow when they advance
                  
                  The story is that only you can find the last resources
                  of intact human genes that were stolen from a genetic 
                  labratory and brought into a big selfruling city-jail.
                   

 Problems :       NO SPEECH OUTPUT POSSIBLE
                  Which is as I believe not a problem of my config as on a 
                  other computer eqipped with 3640/PicassoIV/12MB/
                  System 7.5.3 the problem was the same.
                  This is not a big problem, as only the story in the 
                  beginning and your mission is spoken.
                  Sorry NO text can be turned on.
                  SoundFX during the game works fine.
                                   

 Tested on:       A4000, Cyberstorm060/50MHz, Kick/WB3.1, Cybervision64,
                  Cyberscsi V8.6BETA, Pioneer-DR124X-SCSI-CD-ROM drive,
                  34 MB RAM (22 MB assigned to Shapeshifter), MacOS 7.5.5,

 Rating:          Hmmmm...not that bad, but not that surprising either.
                  I didn`t play it long, as i didn`t like it.
                  The Intro is great, but imho that`s all.
                  With the above noted problems it`s to expensive and 
                  lacking fun.
                  So better buy another game. 

 Demo available:  Not known (I believe not).

 Genre:           Action - Space-Shooter - Star Wars

 Hardware needed: Double Speed CD-ROM, 8MB RAM, mouse, 256color-screenmode

 Software needed: System 7.0

 Description:     "It's an unforgettable arcade experience! Take control of
                  a starfighter in a variety of challenging piloting,

 Rating:          On 68030/25MHz/Cybervision64 you have to adjust the
                  graphics-quality. With 040/40MHz/Cybervision64 it runs in
                  highest resolution.

 Genre:           Action - Space-Shooter

 Hardware needed: 68030, Double Speed CD-ROM, 8MB RAM, 256color-screenmode,

 Software needed: System 7.0, Sound Manager 3.0 and Quicktime 2.0

 Description:     1) "Defeat a vast armada of exotic alien warships as they
                  unleash a deadly assault on earth, then take to outer space
                  as you drive the aliens back to their own planet. Watch the
                  dramatic struggle unfold through over 50 minutes of Holly-
                  wood-style video. An enhanced 3-D terrain engine lets you
                  slice through the landscape faster and smoother than ever
                  before, and the improved polygon count heightens the rush as
                  you dive through canyons and between skyscrapers. This revolu-
                  tionary 3-D space fighter epic takes entertainment technology
                  to the limit!" - Electronic Arts

                  2) Space Shoot-em-up.  Fly your ship close to the ground
                  as you battle invading aliens on earth, then attack them at
                  their base on Mars.  More like a basic flight simulator, this
                  game is all action.  Blast away at the aliens, but watch your
                  fuel and weapons status, and don't fly into any buildings!
                  Great graphics detail, but you need a VERY FAST machine to
                  take advantage of them.  Looks great in 16-bit color. 50 minutes
                  of full-motion video help to keep the game atmosphere interesting.

 Rating:          On 68030/25MHz/Cybervision64 it's unplayable! On 040/40MHz/

@node "superwingcommander" "Super Wing Commander"

Super Wing Commander should work but: with Shapeshifter 3.3 it works
but only if I change my CD-ROM from "DIRECT DMA" to "DIRECT POLLING"
(Fastlane Z3 - look at the Shapeshifter-docs for an explanation).
For that reason the movie-sequences are *very* slow.

With Shapeshifter 3.6 the CD-ROM works as normal but the game crashes...

Tested with:
- Amiga 4000 Rev 3.1
- CyberStorm 060/50MHz MK1
- Fastlane Z3
- CyberVision 64/4MB
- 48MB FastRAM
- 2MB ChipRAM
- Kickstart 3.0
- Workbench 3.1

@node "xwing" "X-Wing"

Needs 040.
You have to turn off very much gfx-details even on 040/40MHz/Cybervision64.
It really CRIES FOR a PowerPC...

Slow gfx and access to CD on: Amiga 1200/Blizzard1260/24MB RAM/SCSI HD/

----------
X-wing:  Space Shoot-em-up.  Fly your X-wing fighter on a multitude of
missions with other rebel forces to oppose the Empire.  Great Star-Wars
setting - good graphics and sound.  Gameplay is difficult without an analog
joystick, but the X-wing is flyable from the keyboard.  Over 120 combat
scarios!  Published by Lucas Arts.
