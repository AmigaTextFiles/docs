                          @{b}@{u}I N T R O D U C T I O N@{ub}@{uu}

Welcome to the Eighth Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is a Monthly UK
BBS Scene Magazine containing a comprehensive UK BBS Directory.

Many SysOps have tried their hands at generating up-to-date BBS Lists, but
most have found them too difficult to maintain and have abandoned updating
them, with the exception of the odd few, like Turbo D at @{BG fill}@{"Alpha Zone BBS" Link AlphaZoneBBS}@{BG background}
who has for the last 11 months supplied a list of BBS Numbers to the AMINET.

However, most BBS Lists contain BBS Numbers of BBSes that have long since
left the scene, and of all the Lists we have encountered, there hasn't been
one that has been accurately up-to-date.

At the time of going to press, ALL the BBSes listed in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} have
been 100% verified as being online.  We have spent the last 9 months
ringing BBS Numbers to find out which BBSes are still online, and to find
out those that have left the scene.  We have still a lot of work to do, but
I'm sure you can appreciate the cost of dialling every BBS Number we have
found in the afore mentioned BBS Lists, and that is why we need YOUR help
in providing us with information of any BBSes you know that are still
online, that are not listed in this Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

Furthermore, we need YOUR help in keeping @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} up-to-date with BBS
Closures, New Numbers, Relaunches, Renames etc.  For more details on how to
contact us, access @{BG fill}@{"Submissions" Link Submissions}@{BG background}.

The BBS Scene is in bad need of positive publicity...and we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
strongly believe that BBS Advertising is a damn good start.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
aims to provide the AMIGA Community with a central resource of information
regarding the current status of the UK BBS Scene, with the added bonus of a
comprehensive UK BBS Directory every month.

When we first researched for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to find out just how many BBSes
were still up and running, we were pleasantly suprised by the number we
found were still online, and those 124 BBSes we found, were entered into
the First Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  That 124 BBSes has now grown to 198 BBSes
for the Eighth Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, just proving that the UK BBS Scene is
far from dead, as was first thought. 

From our point of view, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has really made a difference to the
number of Calls and New Users at our respective BBSes, and many of our New
Users had never been on a BBS before in their lives, the Internet, yes, but
never a BBS, as they thought that BBSes were extinct.  Feedback from other
SysOps who advertised in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} suggests that they have experienced the
same result, which proves a point, that SysOps should not just sit back and
accept the number of Users in their User-Base, but should advertise their
BBSes as much as possible, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} giving them that very chance.

AMIGA FORMAT Magazine recently started a column for BBS Numbers in their
Readers Adverts section, and those that have advertised, including
ourselves, have found that advertising DOES work, and that there ARE
members of the AMIGA Community who want to call BBSes, but never knew
where to get in contact with them!  Therefore in respect of all you SysOps
that think that advertising is a waste of time...we rest our case!!!

The Internet has done much damage to the UK BBS Scene, especially when Free
ISPs were launched, but that damage is not irrepairable, as we have proven,
and ironically @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has used the Internet to get to it's prospective
audience, to get Internet Users back to the UK BBS Scene, and it appears to
have worked, and worked well.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been well received from SysOps and BBS Users alike, and the
Correspondence we have received from Readers has been tremendous.  We
honestly didn't believe that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would be so popular, and its
thanks to your input and feedback that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has established itself
as the leading UK BBS Scene Magazine after only it's Seventh Issue!!!

Plans to take @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}' coverage beyond the United Kingdom are already
under consideration.  Work on @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has already started, but
we foresee a problem that really needs to be addressed before we continue
any further with the project.  Basically, does the UK BBS Scene really want
an International BBS Directory?  If the answer to this questions is "Yes",
then how do we market it?  Do we release it seperately, to give YOU the
choice whether you want to Download it or not, or do we include it within
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, bearing in mind the Archive Size will probably double?

Please help us to make this decision, get in touch with us at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text},
and let us know what YOU want.  If we get no response from YOU, as Readers
of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then the @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} project will be scrapped!!!

Please keep the Correspondence coming, we would especially like to hear from
SysOps who have advertised their BBSes in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and have benefitted
as a result.  Also, if any of you have any ideas on how we can improve the
content of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, or if you have anything at all to contribute to
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then please get in touch, even if you only have a sentence or
two to say, ALL Correspondence will be read and replied to, and may even
get included in the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!

See you Next Issue...

                             @{u}A Word From Dunkie@{uu}

Welcome to Issue 8 of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  The UK BBS Scene has looked in better
shape this month, after the last two disastrous months, with the arrival of
3 *NEW* BBSes and 4 BBS Relaunches.  This is very good news for the UK BBS
Scene, and I hope the SysOps of these establishments will use @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to
it's full potential to help build the foundations of successful BBSes.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has taken a slightly different direction this month, with the
inclusion of AMIGA related News items, and Music Module Reviews courtesy of
Hendrix (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Innocent BBS" Link InnocentBBS}@{BG background}).  I'd like @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers to welcome
Hendrix as part of the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} team, as Hendrix has become @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}'
first and only Staff-Writer, with his very own part of the Magazine.

Some of you may have already seen Messages posted on various Mail Networks,
and on BBSes, concerning the future of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  Despite @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}'
ever increasing popularity and readership, Correspondence has been very poor
and has got the point where I'm now questioning whether it's worth the
effort or not.

The future of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} depends on YOU as SysOps and Readers.  Help me to
justify the time and effort I put into @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} by keeping in touch, no
successful Magazine has ever been launched without Readers Letters etc, and
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is no different.

I have high hopes for the future of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, as does many of its Readers
but Correspondence is absolutely necessary if @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is to continue as
a Magazine.  It is my hope that this Issue's content will attract SysOp and
Reader Correspondence, letting me know just what you think to all the extra
hard work that has been put into this Issue for your benefit.  If this
Correspondence doesn't transpire, then I will have to reconsider my options
and unfortunately that will probably mean that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} will be scrapped.

As Ronnie Murphy (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Kerry-Oot BBS" Link KerryOotBBS}@{BG background}) so abtly puts it in this very
Issue..."@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}...use it or lose it!!!"

                              @{u}A Word From Pete@{uu}

Issue 8 of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} comes with the news that there have been no BBS
Closures in the month of September, plus we have found 3 new BBSes and 4 BBS
Relaunches, bringing the total of active UK BBSes to 198!!!  We are sure
that there are more BBSes running which are not listed in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, so if
YOU the Readers know of any, please let us know so we can get them into the
Magazine.

As you will see in this month's Issue, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has taken a new course in
the form of a Music Module Review column, taken on by a new writer to the
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} staff, Hendrix (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Innocent BBS" Link InnocentBBS}@{BG background}).  His enthusiasm for this
topic is boundless, so please welcome him to the Magazine.

Now onto a more serious topic for all AMIGA Users & SysOps still running
their BBSes on an AMIGA.  There is an article in this Issue which in my mind
is a great piece of investigative journalism by Dunkie (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background})
into the production of the new AMIGA.  His findings have been astonishing to
the fact that some of the information he has obtained has not reached the
AMIGA Magazines yet, so please read the article, which has cost him a pretty
penny in phone calls, plus many daytime hours chasing the story up.

I hope you give him plenty of feedback on his article, not just the regular
few who contribute articles, but all these SysOps out there who seem to have
forgotten how to use a Text Editor!!!

No Magazine can get by without a Readers Mail section, and @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is
no exception.  In the previous 7 Issues of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} we have asked you for
articles and feedback, but only a handful of people have obliged, and we
have now reached the point where we have asked ourselves...is it worth all
the hours spent on creating a monthly Magazine with up-to-date information?

If support for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} does not improve, then we shall have to consider
the prospect of packing it in...for good :(

See you Next Issue...

  @{u}The New AMIGA...A Reality Or An Empty Promise? - By Jon Laker 'Hologram'@{uu}

What are your thoughts on the "New Machine" that seems to be on the way?

Back in the 1980s, our beloved Commodore pioneered a new computer age with
the release of the Commodore AMIGA, the very first computer able to
multi-task with only a base memory of 512K, 16-Bit graphics, stereo sound,
custom chips - and all at the affordable price that people who never owned
a decent computer before could have at home for serious use, as well as a
kids play thing.

It made Bill Gates eat his words when he said: "It would be impossible for
any computer to properly multi-task without at least having 4MB of RAM"!!!

The AMIGA won countless Awards, one of which being "European Computer Of
The Year" in 1984 (I believe)!!!

But, although Commodore was so ahead of their time (for example the release
of the AMIGA CD32 when 16-Bit consoles were only in their beginnings), they
also lacked a certain amount of foresight in a lot of things, expandability
being pretty much top of the list.

Disk-Drives of only 720K capacity?  No provision for Incoming stereo sound
i.e Microphone?  I won`t go on with that, because it digresses from the
issue here.

But Intel and the like have rapidly boomed in terms of development and
production, and we now see immense power in PCs today that was never ever
deemed possible.  Marketing giants like Bill Gates now have such a
stranglehold that there seems no point in contemplating a machine that is
not IBM compatible, if you ever want to do anything worthwhile on the
computer scene.

But those who have owned, developed and supported their AMIGAs can see the
shallowness in the Monster PC.  They enjoy a simple but flexible operating
environment.  The so-called "Plug & Play" has been a reality for AMIGA users
pretty much since day one.  Simple tasks like Word Processing do not need
monster memory or power (Have a look at a PC version of WordWorth 4 and see
the minimum requirements)!!!  Multi-tasking, screen-flicking etc, again are
the basics for us, but only just introduced with Windows 95!!!  Not to
mention the fact that our software runs on so much less memory and occupies
FAR less space on our valuable Hard-Drives!

But when it comes to speed, game-play and the using of modern day add-ons,
the PC now seems to have it licked.  Unless you want to own a console, your
game-play will never kick butt unless you spend a fortune on your AMIGA, or
just go and buy a PC.

Yet...take your hat off to Third Party Developers...Blizzard Boards, PowerPC
etc have really extended the lifetime of our otherwise flagging machine, and
thanks to Shareware and the enthusiasts, we would otherwise have kissed our
machines goodbye long ago!!!

But their efforts always seem to be behind what has already gone on first in
the PC scene.  Why should we have to be one step behind the rest of the
world?  Why should we have to spend a fortune of time and money fiddling
with D.I.Y Towers?  Why can`t we just pop into a local retailer for our
add-ons and software like the rest of the world?

Enter the AMIGA of Tomorrow...

New AMIGA on the way!!!  How long have we been promised that?!?!?!  Since
late 1996?  The Millennium is upon us!!!

PowerPC based!!!  DVD-ROM as standard!!!  All-singing all-dancing ultimate
machine that will give the latest Pentiums a run for their money!!!

Will it ever get here?  The AMIGA seems to be changing hands, everything
seems so political, arguing who will have the rights over this and that,
which operating system will be the definitive alternative to our beloved
WorkBench.

WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET IT?

WILL WE BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT??

WILL ANY HIGH STREET STOCKISTS BOTHER TO SUPPORT THE PLATFORM...OUR ARE WE
DESTINED TO MAIL ORDER ONLY?

What are your views?  Are you an AMIGA lover who is fed up with mail order,
and watching everyone you know enjoy the accessibility of the PC?

I am not technically minded on anything regarding computers and I do not
know all the ins and outs of the big issues that are obviously attached to
such a debate...it`s not all that simple I know!!!

But do you want a New AMIGA?  Let's here your views...

I run @{BG fill}@{"Gravity BBS" Link GravityBBS}@{BG background} in Southampton, Hampshire on (023)-8048-3880 - why not
call and share your views with us?  Or find a BBS near you supporting
PowerNet, a shared MailBase throughout UK BBSes that is FULL of people who
want to hear your views...on this and any other subject!!!

                Swimming in quicksand				
                No one willing to lend a hand
                They're happy just to see
                someone else rescue me.

                Not getting dirty or wet
                letting people just use the net
                and sit there on their hands
                looking at all the other quicksands.

                Sitting alone at the screen,
                no caller - there never has been.
                Not one click of the hard drive
                this dying board is barely alive.

                Yes he is sitting there all alone
                wondering why he never hears the phone.
                wondering why it will never ring
                he hasn't advertised - not a thing.

                His AMIGA heartbeat is slowing,
                how much longer can it keep on going
                What has happened to those past perfections?
                "If only I had used @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}........."

The above poem seems to portray a lot more about we SysOps than you can
imagine.  There will be people like him all over the UK...sitting at their
BBS happy with those few callers they get each week, thinking about those 
past glory days when they got numerous calls every day and night, thinking 
about the BBS Scene as if it was on it's last legs.
 
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has given you a chance to open your eyes - to see that the BBS
Scene is very much alive - true it is on a life-support after being brutally
beaten by the Internet, but its heart beats stronger with every call.

The BBS Scene is in a state of limbo, and there has never been more an apt
time to advertise your BBS.  Not only in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}...but on every BBS you
call, even in AMIGA FORMAT or other Computer Magazines!!!

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has given you a chance - use it, or you'll lose it.

     @{u}Letter To CoNnEcTiOnS Readers - By Hendrix (SysOp Of Innocent BBS)@{uu}

Hello @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers...

You may have noticed my Music Module Reviews in this edition of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text},
a piece of work which took all of twenty minutes to put together.  I have
been in touch with the Editor, Dunkie (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}), about the
success of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} and how likely it is to continue.  It seems clear to
him that the lack of response from @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers could make this Issue
one of the last.  I think it is deplorable to hear that such a good idea for
the UK BBS Scene is being mistreated and unglorified.  It was a great bit of
ingenuity for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to get a spot on AMIGA FORMAT's CD-ROM (AFCD44)!!!

I'm sure all you @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers out there would find it no problem to
write a short review of a piece of hardware or software, even compile a few
game hints or reviews.  If you find it hard to believe your writing is up to
scratch, I would make a pretty good bet you've all written some mail to a
SysOp, if not regularly, at some point in your BBSing career.  Even if you
don't know how to put a piece of writing together, here's a hint:-

Start with an introduction, summarising what you're going to talk about,
then add your middle bit, which should detail and contrast your subject,
then finally add the conclusion, giving your thoughts, faults and facts.

Ask yourself this, OK it's just a hobby, but wouldn't you like to have the
best hobby you can.  That's what I believe @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} can do for me, but in
order to get that out, I have to put a little in, and I mean it IS only a
little.

So come on @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers, let's get together on this one at least.
There are so many methods of which you can submit your Correspondence and
Articles, so there's no excuse.  You will be letting down the whole BBS
Community if you don't give it a try.

"Seems Gateway Isn't The Friend That AMIGA Fans Thought It Was!" headlined
Business Week Online on September 10th 1999, and no more could the truth be
summarised.  Recent developments at AMIGA Inc have given the AMIGA Community
a real cause for concern, with the abrupt departure of Jim Collas (CEO Of
AMIGA Inc) on September 1st 1999, who despite reports of leaving to pursue
other interests and opportunities, officially announced that he had resigned
and then went on to sell his entire 118,000 Gateway Stock, netting £8.3
million in the process...hardly the actions of a man who had supposedly left
AMIGA Inc amicably!!!

Jim Collas had been a senior figure at Gateway before taking on the post of
Chief Executive Officer at AMIGA Inc 8 months ago, and his sudden departure,
along with the sacking of Bill McEwen (Jim Collas' second man), sent warning
bells ringing through the AMIGA Community as to AMIGA Inc's plans for the
future of the AMIGA platform.

AMIGA Inc had announced in July the specifications for their new next-
generation AMIGA Computer, known as the MCC (Multi-Computer Convergence),
and for the first time in years, it actually looked as though AMIGA Inc were
going to deliver what the AMIGA Community had been promised since 1994...a
new AMIGA Computer!!!

Jim Collas' enthusiasm and drive towards this new next-generation AMIGA
moved the AMIGA Community, the MCC would have really put AMIGA back into the
Home-Computer Market with a bang, and would have really upset the PC Market,
by delivering the world's first 128-Bit Home-Computer System, capable of
emulating almost every Computer Platform currently on the Market.  So much
was the power of this next-generation AMIGA, that big Software names like
Corel and Adobe were rumoured to be developing versions of their most
popular applications for the new machine...but alas, this dream turned from
reality to fantasy when AMIGA Inc decided to U-Turn their plans yet again,
and halted any further development of the next-generation AMIGA, despite
promising the AMIGA Community on several occasions, including the World Of
Amiga Show in London, that they would be delivering the next-generation
AMIGA around Christmas 1999/January 2000!!!

Jim Collas' replacement Tom Schmidt, tried his best to reassure the AMIGA
Community that the next-generation AMIGA was NOT dead, but less than a week
later, he too U-Turned, and officially announced the death of the next-
generation AMIGA :(

Gateway paid $13 million for the rights to AMIGA patents in 1997, and since
buying AMIGA Inc, has constantly changed AMIGA Inc's management team and
kept the AMIGA Community hanging on with false promises and countless
U-Turns in publicly announced decisions.  Now Gateway has announced that
AMIGA technology is going to be used in the Internet Appliance Market, and
that no further AMIGA Computers are going to be built by AMIGA Inc.  This
may sound very exciting to Gateway, but the excitement is far from matched
by the AMIGA Community, who feel totally and utterly betrayed by Gateway.

So...what does the AMIGA Community do now?  Do we wait with baited breath
for an outside Computer Developer to license the next-generation AMIGA
technology and build the new AMIGA, or do we give up on the notion that
the AMIGA is never going to resurface again as a Home Computer?

My personal opinion on this matter, is that AMIGA Inc has just committed
suicide by effectively hammering the final nail into the AMIGA's coffin,
effectively ending the AMIGA era.  The AMIGA Community is now going to have
to wake up to the fact that the Home Computer Market is going into the next
millennium WITHOUT the AMIGA!!!

To quote Gateway's advertising slogan "You've got a friend in the business",
from the AMIGA Community's viewpoint, these words couldn't be further from
the truth, and as has always been the case...actions speak louder than
words!!!

SEPTEMBER 6TH 1999

Dear AMIGAns:

I wanted to make sure everyone knew that Jim Collas has chosen to leave
AMIGA to pursue other interests and opportunities.  I would like to
personally thank Jim for the leadership and vision he brought to AMIGA and
the entire AMIGA community over the past eight months.  We wish him the best
of luck in his new endeavours. 

I have been with AMIGA since April of this year as the Chief Operating
Officer and I continue to be extremely excited about the plans and
strategies we have been working very hard on the past several months.

Those plans will continue with a great business and technology leadership
team focused on the emerging Internet Appliance market space.  As we
finalise our plans in this area, we will communicate those to the community.

I would also like to thank Bill McEwen for his many contributions to the
AMIGA community and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavours.
Bill has been a steady and calming voice to the community.

Regards,

Thomas J. Schmidt

President & Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

SEPTEMBER 14TH 1999

Thanks for your notes and comments about our plans for AMIGA.  In the past
couple of weeks, we've received hundreds - if not thousands - of E-Mails and
messages from loyal AMIGAns worldwide, many of you expressing a concern
about AMIGA's future based on recent reports in the media and in numerous
chat rooms.  I am so impressed with the spirit and passion of this great
community and I wanted to make sure I told you that.  

The fact is...to borrow from Mark Twain...the reports of AMIGA's death have
been greatly exaggerated.  To that end, I wanted to provide a little more
detail about our plans for AMIGA...both as a product and as a company, and
hopefully clear up any confusion that exists.

First, I hope you'd agree that AMIGA was never about a box.  It was never
about an operating system either.  Sure those things were part of what made
the original AMIGA great, but at its heart, AMIGA was simply about a better
way.  AMIGA was ahead of its time.  AMIGA promised to change the world.  It
ran against conventional wisdom and was better than anything out there at
the time.  In fact, we could all argue that it's still better than anything
out there.

The ideals and spirit of that original AMIGA are alive and well today.  But
to limit AMIGA to just one box, one product, one OS, is to keep AMIGA from
ever seeing its full potential.  Think about it...the original AMIGA never
did really reach its full potential despite its technical advantages and its
cost and ease of use advantages.  Why?  Because it never became ubiquitous.
The company's early vision was probably too limited for the vast potential
that AMIGA offered.

The original AMIGA was all about multi-media, so why not have AMIGA running
on every type of device imaginable, on top of every other OS out there?
That's the beauty of AMIGA and where we are as an industry.  We're in the
midst of a revolution unlike anything the world has seen, and AMIGA has
never been better positioned to change that world and make a bigger impact.
Limiting AMIGA to just one box and one OS at this point would be like
offering the world a better horse and carriage at the dawn of the automotive
age.  AMIGA and its revolutionary spirit deserve better than that.  AMIGA is
going to produce software technology that will enable Internet services on
an emerging category of products commonly referred to as "Information
Appliances".  It is an exciting new mega trend in the industry and we are
excited about being at the forefront of this next great wave in computing
history.  In addition, we have decided to work with business partners who
will deliver our software technology on their systems, rather than enter the
hardware business directly.

So long live AMIGA, but if you think that AMIGA was just a box, you've
missed the point.  AMIGA is about a better way.  In the coming weeks and
months, we promise to keep you posted on progress against our plans for
AMIGA, and we thank you for your continued support.  Let's work together to
enable AMIGA to revolutionise the industry and change the world!

Long live AMIGA,

Thomas J. Schmidt

President & Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

SEPTEMBER 17TH 1999

There has been a great deal of confusion and frustration expressed in the
news groups and via E-Mail over the past several weeks.  I apologise that we
have not been more direct in our communications, and I want to set the
record straight. 

First, per my previous messages, I continue to be impressed with the passion
and commitment of this community.  You have "hung in there" through a number
of upheavals over the past years, and through several false starts on next-
generation AMIGA platforms.  You deserve better.  I have received many, many
E-Mails over the past two weeks, expressing your opinions and frustrations.
Let me try and summarise what I have heard.

Many of you acknowledge the fact that we are focusing on software for the
coming generation of "Internet appliances."  We are very excited about the
new AMIGA Operating Environment, the work we are doing with Linux (and other
operating systems that support Java), and the huge growth curve in Internet
appliances that we are going to ride.  You have gracefully wished us well in
this endeavor, for that, I thank you.  As you know, we announced in July
that we were pursuing the development of a "multimedia convergence computer"
that would serve as the next-generation AMIGA desktop computer.  After the
change in management at AMIGA, we reviewed all our product plans.  To be
honest, the ability for us to deliver the MCC was unrealistic.  Furthermore,
I have fundamentally decided that it would be better to partner with a wide
variety of hardware partners, rather than compete against them with a
product of our own.   

From your perspective, one big problem exists.  Sounds great, but what does
this new direction have to do with the original AMIGA computer?  Quite
honestly, nothing!  We realise that this does not satisfy the desire of the
AMIGA community for a next-generation AMIGA.  In response, I remain
committed to seek out partners who are interested in developing a next-
generation AMIGA computer and operating system.  We have been following the
discussions amongst the newly formed "Phoenix Platform Consortium" and
talking to companies interested in supplying the next-generation AMIGA.  We
are open to the possibility of licensing the MCC product specification and
design that is now on the shelf to companies that are interested in further
developing the AMIGA desktop computer product line.  We believe that this
could be an attractive business opportunity for another company.

In summary, we are continuing to focus our resources on setting software
standards for the coming generation of Internet appliances.  We are not
planning to offer hardware devices, but will work with hardware
manufacturers who want to license our technology.  As far as offering next-
generation AMIGA systems, we are open to talking to companies who want to
offer such a product.  For those of you who are excited about the AMIGA
Operating Environment running on a wide variety of future Internet
appliances, we invite you to track our progress and activities over the
coming months.  The Internet appliance software model that we are putting
together will open up an exciting new era of software development that we
think will be very interesting to the type of innovative thinkers who were
drawn to the AMIGA computer in years past.

Best regards,

Thomas J. Schmidt

 @{u}Petro Tyschtschenko (AMIGA) Speaks Exclusively To CoNnEcTiOnS - By Dunkie@{uu}

On Sunday 3rd October 1999, I E-Mailed Petro Tyschtschenko at AMIGA Inc, and
asked him to confirm AMIGA Inc's status regarding the next-generation AMIGA.
Below are copies of both my E-Mail to Petro Tyschtschenko, and his reply to
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}:-

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   From: "Dunkie" <questbbs@freenet.co.uk>
   Date: 3 Oct 99
Subject: AMIGA Status Report
     To: ptysch@aol.com

Dear Petro...

I am writing to you as Editor of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, an AmigaGuide based Disk
Magazine, specializing in the AMIGA UK BBS Scene, released on the AMINET
every month.

After hearing the news of Jim Collas' resignation, I felt I had to write to
you, to ask you in all honesty, just what AMIGA intend to do now.  I believe
AMIGA owes it to its dedicated Community, who have maintained their loyalty
to the platform, through thick and thin, for all these years.

AMIGA yet again have dangled the carrot, only to whisk it away again, and
time after time again, they have done this to the AMIGA Community, and for
me, this latest turn of events has effectively hammered the last nail in the
AMIGA's coffin :(

The AMIGA cannot survive on Software and a new Operating System alone.  The
MCC was a giant leap in the right direction for the future of the AMIGA, and
indeed for the Computer Industry as a whole.  The AMIGA has spent far too
long playing catch-up with the PC, and really needs to gain the advantage by
being one-step ahead, if it is to survive. 

But the AMIGA's survival is treading a very thin line, with many UK AMIGA
Owners selling up and going PC.  Who can blame them?  But it's the AMIGA
Owners that AMIGA will be wanting to target first, if and when a new AMIGA
surfaces.  It's going to be a lot harder to get these people back to the
AMIGA Platform, and the longer AMIGA keeps the AMIGA Community waiting for
actual results, not promises, AMIGA is going to find that their won't be an
AMIGA Community left when the time comes to market their efforts :(

I know you have worked with AMIGA now for many a year, and I applaud your
loyalty to the AMIGA.  Please...I'm asking you now if you can talk to me and
the Readers of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, regarding AMIGA's current status, and just what
plans AMIGA has, now that the new AMIGA appears in all intents and purposes
to be dead :(

Thanks for listening...

Dear Dunkie:

Unfortunately I have had no influence to the developments in the last weeks.
My understanding is that it is AMIGA Inc's dream to build a ubiquitous
platform that can succeed in the environment of the future, not an
unsuccessful computer that is rooted in the past.

The dream of ubiquitous computing and a common AMIGA interface across
multiple devices (PC`s, Mac`s, Phones, TV`s, PDA`s, Cars, Internet, etc) is
the direction of AMIGA Inc.  Gateway wants AMIGA to be pervasive and in use
by millions...an exciting adventure into the future.

I am quite sure that there are also some enterprising people which are
willing to continue with the existing AMIGA technology...and I will support
those of course.

I will continue to support my A1200 sales with spareparts and service as
long as it is requested from our AMIGA community and for the benefit of my
beloved AMIGA.  Our OS 3.5 will be available in the next 2-3 weeks.
 
Best regards

Petro

Some of you may find it amusing that Petro Tyschtschenko talks about his
beloved AMIGA, yet he E-Mailed me using AOL 4.0i for Windows 95 :)))

Hello @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers, and welcome to my first review column.  Dunkie
(SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}) has been kind enough to let me write a few reviews for
connections in this month's edition.  I don't know if it'll be a regular
thing, just let him or me know what you think and we'll see what happens.

Anyway here's how it'll work provided you like it and it keeps going.  I'm
going to give an overall rating of the Music Module out of 10.  This rating
is governed by a few factors, these being - Commercial Viability: This is
whether I and some of my Music Industry contacts think it could be vinyl
worthy.  Style & Groove: This is whether the Music Module actually has taste
and style, be it "Of The Moment" or not, and Sampling & Timing:  This is the
most important, if it ain't in tune or out of time then you've failed!!!

Also I'll try and give a list of where to get the Music Modules, but they'll
all be available at @{BG fill}@{"Innocent BBS" Link InnocentBBS}@{BG background}, so you can download them there or upload
any submissions you want me to review, or just give my personal opinion on.
If you do want to submit something, then please make it something I can
listen to i.e one of the more popular Music Module formats.  I don't want to
be converting Music Modules of all sorts, please do it for me.  Plus if
there are any specific Music Modules or styles you would like mentioned or 
reviewed, then let me or Dunkie (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}) know.

All the Music Modules reviewed have been played through a Stereo, to give
maximum effect and I suggest you do the same!!!

OK, let's see.  I'm not a Drum & Bass or Jungle fan but this Module is
kicking, a shining example of what can be done with only 4 tracks.  This
Module has serious commercial viability, it has all the hooks and cuts of a
mainstream 12", plus lots of groove and changes so as not to let you loose
your interest.  The timing is superbly tuned for a Module and the voice
sampling is well chosen and clear.  I really can't fault it much at all,
except that it does have a certain amount of repetativeness, but all its
great melodies and hooks far outway those bad points.

This Module would have been another high flyer had it had any financial
backing I reckon.  Another Module with serious commercial viabilty, the only
thing it lacks is a bit of time spent.  If the author had spent time
actually mixing this Module then it would have been kickin, but alas he must
have been itching to get on with his next masterpiece.  On the whole though
I can't really be picky about it because it has lots of potential and
concept.  I just want to stop and mix the volume on the samples every time I
put it on.  But on the good side it does have lots of cool little grooves
and melodies, it's just a pity about the length as you're left waiting until
the next melody kicks in, but saying that, it is worth the wait.  Let me
warn you, it has an annoying reversed voice sample right at the beginning
which is just a sheer disappointment, but do give it a chance as it soon
goes away to let the tune do its work.

The samples in this Module are superbly done but again this is a another
Module that is faulted by the time spent on mixing.  All it needed was a
little volume mixing, but this Module has some serious drum loops and bass
sounds.  This could have been a hardcore underground extravaganza at the
begining of the dance craze, and is one of those tunes that isn't going to
age for a while yet.  The strange thing is that it's very repetative, but
doesn't seem to loose my interest, must be some kind of subliminal message.
Anyway if you like Drum & Bass/Jungle don't miss this one it's pretty cool
and worth a blast on the old Stereo if you can.

This one is very repetative, but it has a real dark feeling to it and has a
brilliant filtering effect throughout it, which I hardly ever hear used in
the correct way, but it's used here to a give a great effect.  It falls
short on the content, getting a bit bare at times, but when it kicks it
really does kick.  The minus points are: it could have used a little mixing
just to perk the whole thing up a bit, and it is a little bare, but I think

  Module Title: Deliciously
 Module Author: Kure4Kancer
  Module Style: Euro Dance
Available From: AMINET (mods/k4k/delicious.lha)

This Module scores for technicality alone, although that's about all.  It's
got this excellent flange effect that comes in about half way through but
for no apparent reason.  Most annoyingly it has no major interest other than
that.  As one of AMINET's most recent uploads, amongst about 20 others from
the same author, I have to ask myself is this all that AMIGA musicians are
producing.  We want quality please!!!  It can be done.  This tune has that
typical European industrial techno sound to it, what I mean is this is
typical of what I would expect from the continent on 12".  Maybe it's just
not my cup of tea, but I'm left thinking...was it worth the download time?

 Module Author: <Unnamed>
  Module Style: Funk/Acid Jazz/Easy Listening
Available From: AMINET (mods/funk/batucada.lha)

If you like Acid Jazz or Easy Listening then it's likely this Module will
tickle your fancy.  As soon as it starts you're introduced with a pleasant
bass and drum loop which is basically the whole song throughout, although
about half way through, it breaks down and comes in with an annoying out of
time drum beat.  Be patient it goes away after about 8 bars.  I can't really
fault this one although it does seem as though the author has done a little
experimenting, and this has spoiled the over all finished Module.  By this
I mean the change in drum loop three quarters of the way through and odd
samples thrown in here and there.  Otherwise if you want something relaxing
to listen to in the background on your AMIGA then this is just the ticket,
it's not to overbearing and most of the samples are well chosen and mixed
for the context of the tune.

  Module Style: Funk/Acid Jazz/Easy Listening
Available From: AMINET (mods/funk/cityair.lha)

For a funk Module with guitar and drums that aren't loops, this is a very
well done Module.  The samples are well mixed and chosen, and the content is
almost vinyl worthy.  If it had vocals and the instruments were real, it
could almost sound as if it was one of the Brand New Heavies' tunes.  I warn
you however if egotistical instrumentals are not your style, then keep well
clear of this one.

  Module Style: Euro Dance
Available From: AMINET (mods/med/evolut.lha)

The very mention of the name "Euro Dance" almost makes me throw up, but in
the interests of fair criticism, here's one for the Euro Dance fans.  OK...
so we've all heard one like this before, but for an AMIGA attempt, it's not
bad, and it has enough changes for me.  The weird bit is, I'm sure that if
it had vocals it would have been on every "Best of Euro Dance" album in the
country last summer, and all those silly little boy racers would have bought
it...fools!!!  Anyway, if you like a bit of Euro Dance, then try this one.
Bad points: it has a kind of weird out of tune synth that gets a bit
annoying.

Celsius is fast turning out to be a favourite of mine, but if you like
quality then you will understand.  Here we have a phenomenal Hip-Hop effort,
with absolutely astounding quality voice samples.  Again, I can't fault this
tune for a single thing, the mix is of studio quality and stylistically,
it's groovin.  I bet you tap your feet to at least 20 seconds of it!!!  The
timing is spot on especially for drums and voice samples mixed together,
plus there is a good mixture of samples and tonal differences to keep you
nodding your head to the beat.

Ever started listening to a tune for the first time, then just as you are 
about to turn it off it hits you right in the face with something you
wouldn't have expected, well this is one of those ones.  It just blew me
away, I mean everybody knows what Dub is, but for me, I tend to find it hard
to get my head around it, even after playing in a Ska band for nearly two
years!!!  But if you want a good idea of what Dub is, then give this a
listen, it has also got something for you Drum & Bass freaks out there.  I
suppose you could call it a sort of Dub to Drum & Bass crossover.

"My single word description for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is BRILLIANT!!!  Way back in the
days when I used to run a BBS (well 2 actually), there were BBSes all over
the place.  I dropped off the BBS Scene for about 2 years, in favour of the
Internet, then recently I decided to check out the BBS Scene once again.  I
searched the Internet for a damn long time until I was able to come up with
a single BBS Number, somewhere across the country from me, and from there I
managed to get a copy of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  So after finally finding a few local
BBSes, from there I've got well back into the BBS Scene and decided to start
up @{BG fill}@{"Erotic Studios BBS" Link EroticStudiosBBS}@{BG background} :)  Keep up the good work on @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, I certainly 
appreciate it!!!"

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

Glad to hear that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} was your major influence in your starting up
@{BG fill}@{"Erotic Studios BBS" Link EroticStudiosBBS}@{BG background}.  Would it be possible for you to name the BBS you found
