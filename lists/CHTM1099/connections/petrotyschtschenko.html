 <u>Petro Tyschtschenko (AMIGA) Speaks Exclusively To CoNnEcTiOnS - By Dunkie</u>

On Sunday 3rd October 1999, I E-Mailed Petro Tyschtschenko at AMIGA Inc, and
asked him to confirm AMIGA Inc's status regarding the next-generation AMIGA.
Below are copies of both my E-Mail to Petro Tyschtschenko, and his reply to
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">:-

Dear Petro...

I am writing to you as Editor of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, an AmigaGuide based Disk
Magazine, specializing in the AMIGA UK BBS Scene, released on the AMINET
every month.

After hearing the news of Jim Collas' resignation, I felt I had to write to
you, to ask you in all honesty, just what AMIGA intend to do now.  I believe
AMIGA owes it to its dedicated Community, who have maintained their loyalty
to the platform, through thick and thin, for all these years.

AMIGA yet again have dangled the carrot, only to whisk it away again, and
time after time again, they have done this to the AMIGA Community, and for
me, this latest turn of events has effectively hammered the last nail in the
AMIGA's coffin :(

The AMIGA cannot survive on Software and a new Operating System alone.  The
MCC was a giant leap in the right direction for the future of the AMIGA, and
indeed for the Computer Industry as a whole.  The AMIGA has spent far too
long playing catch-up with the PC, and really needs to gain the advantage by
being one-step ahead, if it is to survive. 

But the AMIGA's survival is treading a very thin line, with many UK AMIGA
Owners selling up and going PC.  Who can blame them?  But it's the AMIGA
Owners that AMIGA will be wanting to target first, if and when a new AMIGA
surfaces.  It's going to be a lot harder to get these people back to the
AMIGA Platform, and the longer AMIGA keeps the AMIGA Community waiting for
actual results, not promises, AMIGA is going to find that their won't be an
AMIGA Community left when the time comes to market their efforts :(

I know you have worked with AMIGA now for many a year, and I applaud your
loyalty to the AMIGA.  Please...I'm asking you now if you can talk to me and
the Readers of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, regarding AMIGA's current status, and just what
plans AMIGA has, now that the new AMIGA appears in all intents and purposes
to be dead :(

Thanks for listening...

Dear Dunkie:

Unfortunately I have had no influence to the developments in the last weeks.
My understanding is that it is AMIGA Inc's dream to build a ubiquitous
platform that can succeed in the environment of the future, not an
unsuccessful computer that is rooted in the past.

The dream of ubiquitous computing and a common AMIGA interface across
multiple devices (PC`s, Mac`s, Phones, TV`s, PDA`s, Cars, Internet, etc) is
the direction of AMIGA Inc.  Gateway wants AMIGA to be pervasive and in use
by millions...an exciting adventure into the future.

I am quite sure that there are also some enterprising people which are
willing to continue with the existing AMIGA technology...and I will support
those of course.

I will continue to support my A1200 sales with spareparts and service as
long as it is requested from our AMIGA community and for the benefit of my
beloved AMIGA.  Our OS 3.5 will be available in the next 2-3 weeks.
 
Best regards

Petro

Some of you may find it amusing that Petro Tyschtschenko talks about his
beloved AMIGA, yet he E-Mailed me using AOL 4.0i for Windows 95 :)))
