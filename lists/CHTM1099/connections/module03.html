   <u>Electronica: Music Module Reviews - By Hendrix (SysOp Of Innocent BBS)</u>

  Module Title: &#060;Unnamed&#062;
 Module Author: &#060;Unnamed&#062;
  Module Style: Drum &amp; Bass/Jungle
Available From: AMINET (mods/jungl/ddub.lha)

The samples in this Module are superbly done but again this is a another
Module that is faulted by the time spent on mixing.  All it needed was a
little volume mixing, but this Module has some serious drum loops and bass
sounds.  This could have been a hardcore underground extravaganza at the
begining of the dance craze, and is one of those tunes that isn't going to
age for a while yet.  The strange thing is that it's very repetative, but
doesn't seem to loose my interest, must be some kind of subliminal message.
Anyway if you like Drum &amp; Bass/Jungle don't miss this one it's pretty cool
and worth a blast on the old Stereo if you can.

<b>Commercial Viability:</b> 4/5
      <b>Style &amp; Groove:</b> 3/5
   <b>Sampling &amp; Timing:</b> 3/5

       <b>Module Rating:</b> 7/10
