  <u>Open Letter To The AMIGA Community - By Tom Schmidt (CEO Of AMIGA Inc)</u>

SEPTEMBER 6TH 1999

Dear AMIGAns:

I wanted to make sure everyone knew that Jim Collas has chosen to leave
AMIGA to pursue other interests and opportunities.  I would like to
personally thank Jim for the leadership and vision he brought to AMIGA and
the entire AMIGA community over the past eight months.  We wish him the best
of luck in his new endeavours. 

I have been with AMIGA since April of this year as the Chief Operating
Officer and I continue to be extremely excited about the plans and
strategies we have been working very hard on the past several months.

Those plans will continue with a great business and technology leadership
team focused on the emerging Internet Appliance market space.  As we
finalise our plans in this area, we will communicate those to the community.

I would also like to thank Bill McEwen for his many contributions to the
AMIGA community and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavours.
Bill has been a steady and calming voice to the community.

Regards,

Thomas J. Schmidt

President &amp; Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
