   <u>Electronica: Music Module Reviews - By Hendrix (SysOp Of Innocent BBS)</u>

  Module Title: &#060;Unnamed&#062;
 Module Author: &#060;Unnamed&#062;
  Module Style: Drum &amp; Bass/Jungle
Available From: AMINET (mods/jungl/dbmix.lha)

This Module would have been another high flyer had it had any financial
backing I reckon.  Another Module with serious commercial viabilty, the only
thing it lacks is a bit of time spent.  If the author had spent time
actually mixing this Module then it would have been kickin, but alas he must
have been itching to get on with his next masterpiece.  On the whole though
I can't really be picky about it because it has lots of potential and
concept.  I just want to stop and mix the volume on the samples every time I
put it on.  But on the good side it does have lots of cool little grooves
and melodies, it's just a pity about the length as you're left waiting until
the next melody kicks in, but saying that, it is worth the wait.  Let me
warn you, it has an annoying reversed voice sample right at the beginning
which is just a sheer disappointment, but do give it a chance as it soon
goes away to let the tune do its work.

<b>Commercial Viability:</b> 4/5
      <b>Style &amp; Groove:</b> 4/5
   <b>Sampling &amp; Timing:</b> 3/5

       <b>Module Rating:</b> 7/10
