                             <u>A Word From Dunkie</u>

Welcome to Issue 8 of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  The UK BBS Scene has looked in better
shape this month, after the last two disastrous months, with the arrival of
3 *NEW* BBSes and 4 BBS Relaunches.  This is very good news for the UK BBS
Scene, and I hope the SysOps of these establishments will use <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> to
it's full potential to help build the foundations of successful BBSes.

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has taken a slightly different direction this month, with the
inclusion of AMIGA related News items, and Music Module Reviews courtesy of
Hendrix (SysOp Of <a href="innocentbbs.html">Innocent BBS</a>).  I'd like <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers to welcome
Hendrix as part of the <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> team, as Hendrix has become <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">'
first and only Staff-Writer, with his very own part of the Magazine.

Some of you may have already seen Messages posted on various Mail Networks,
and on BBSes, concerning the future of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  Despite <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">'
ever increasing popularity and readership, Correspondence has been very poor
and has got the point where I'm now questioning whether it's worth the
effort or not.

The future of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> depends on YOU as SysOps and Readers.  Help me to
justify the time and effort I put into <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> by keeping in touch, no
successful Magazine has ever been launched without Readers Letters etc, and
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is no different.

I have high hopes for the future of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, as does many of its Readers
but Correspondence is absolutely necessary if <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is to continue as
a Magazine.  It is my hope that this Issue's content will attract SysOp and
Reader Correspondence, letting me know just what you think to all the extra
hard work that has been put into this Issue for your benefit.  If this
Correspondence doesn't transpire, then I will have to reconsider my options
and unfortunately that will probably mean that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> will be scrapped.

As Ronnie Murphy (SysOp Of <a href="kerryootbbs.html">Kerry-Oot BBS</a>) so abtly puts it in this very
Issue...&quot;<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">...use it or lose it!!!&quot;

See you Next Issue...

                              <u>A Word From Pete</u>

Issue 8 of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> comes with the news that there have been no BBS
Closures in the month of September, plus we have found 3 new BBSes and 4 BBS
Relaunches, bringing the total of active UK BBSes to 198!!!  We are sure
that there are more BBSes running which are not listed in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, so if
YOU the Readers know of any, please let us know so we can get them into the
Magazine.

As you will see in this month's Issue, <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has taken a new course in
the form of a Music Module Review column, taken on by a new writer to the
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> staff, Hendrix (SysOp Of <a href="innocentbbs.html">Innocent BBS</a>).  His enthusiasm for this
topic is boundless, so please welcome him to the Magazine.

Now onto a more serious topic for all AMIGA Users &amp; SysOps still running
their BBSes on an AMIGA.  There is an article in this Issue which in my mind
is a great piece of investigative journalism by Dunkie (SysOp Of <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a>)
into the production of the new AMIGA.  His findings have been astonishing to
the fact that some of the information he has obtained has not reached the
AMIGA Magazines yet, so please read the article, which has cost him a pretty
penny in phone calls, plus many daytime hours chasing the story up.

I hope you give him plenty of feedback on his article, not just the regular
few who contribute articles, but all these SysOps out there who seem to have
forgotten how to use a Text Editor!!!

No Magazine can get by without a Readers Mail section, and <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is
no exception.  In the previous 7 Issues of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> we have asked you for
articles and feedback, but only a handful of people have obliged, and we
have now reached the point where we have asked ourselves...is it worth all
the hours spent on creating a monthly Magazine with up-to-date information?

If support for <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> does not improve, then we shall have to consider
the prospect of packing it in...for good :(

See you Next Issue...
