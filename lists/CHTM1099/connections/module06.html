   <u>Electronica: Music Module Reviews - By Hendrix (SysOp Of Innocent BBS)</u>

  Module Title: Batucada
 Module Author: &#060;Unnamed&#062;
  Module Style: Funk/Acid Jazz/Easy Listening
Available From: AMINET (mods/funk/batucada.lha)

If you like Acid Jazz or Easy Listening then it's likely this Module will
tickle your fancy.  As soon as it starts you're introduced with a pleasant
bass and drum loop which is basically the whole song throughout, although
about half way through, it breaks down and comes in with an annoying out of
time drum beat.  Be patient it goes away after about 8 bars.  I can't really
fault this one although it does seem as though the author has done a little
experimenting, and this has spoiled the over all finished Module.  By this
I mean the change in drum loop three quarters of the way through and odd
samples thrown in here and there.  Otherwise if you want something relaxing
to listen to in the background on your AMIGA then this is just the ticket,
it's not to overbearing and most of the samples are well chosen and mixed
for the context of the tune.

<b>Commercial Viability:</b> 3/5
      <b>Style &amp; Groove:</b> 4/5
   <b>Sampling &amp; Timing:</b> 3/5

       <b>Module Rating:</b> 4/10
