           <u>Quicksand - By Ronnie Murphy (SysOp Of Kerry-Oot BBS)</u>

                Swimming in quicksand&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;
                No one willing to lend a hand
                They're happy just to see
                someone else rescue me.

                Not getting dirty or wet
                letting people just use the net
                and sit there on their hands
                looking at all the other quicksands.

                Sitting alone at the screen,
                no caller - there never has been.
                Not one click of the hard drive
                this dying board is barely alive.

                Yes he is sitting there all alone
                wondering why he never hears the phone.
                wondering why it will never ring
                he hasn't advertised - not a thing.

                His AMIGA heartbeat is slowing,
                how much longer can it keep on going
                What has happened to those past perfections?
                &quot;If only I had used <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.........&quot;

The above poem seems to portray a lot more about we SysOps than you can
imagine.  There will be people like him all over the UK...sitting at their
BBS happy with those few callers they get each week, thinking about those 
past glory days when they got numerous calls every day and night, thinking 
about the BBS Scene as if it was on it's last legs.
 
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has given you a chance to open your eyes - to see that the BBS
Scene is very much alive - true it is on a life-support after being brutally
beaten by the Internet, but its heart beats stronger with every call.

The BBS Scene is in a state of limbo, and there has never been more an apt
time to advertise your BBS.  Not only in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">...but on every BBS you
call, even in AMIGA FORMAT or other Computer Magazines!!!

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has given you a chance - use it, or you'll lose it.
