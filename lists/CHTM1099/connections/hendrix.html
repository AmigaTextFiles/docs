     <u>Letter To CoNnEcTiOnS Readers - By Hendrix (SysOp Of Innocent BBS)</u>

Hello <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers...

You may have noticed my Music Module Reviews in this edition of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">,
a piece of work which took all of twenty minutes to put together.  I have
been in touch with the Editor, Dunkie (SysOp Of <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a>), about the
success of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> and how likely it is to continue.  It seems clear to
him that the lack of response from <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers could make this Issue
one of the last.  I think it is deplorable to hear that such a good idea for
the UK BBS Scene is being mistreated and unglorified.  It was a great bit of
ingenuity for <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> to get a spot on AMIGA FORMAT's CD-ROM (AFCD44)!!!

I'm sure all you <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers out there would find it no problem to
write a short review of a piece of hardware or software, even compile a few
game hints or reviews.  If you find it hard to believe your writing is up to
scratch, I would make a pretty good bet you've all written some mail to a
SysOp, if not regularly, at some point in your BBSing career.  Even if you
don't know how to put a piece of writing together, here's a hint:-

Start with an introduction, summarising what you're going to talk about,
then add your middle bit, which should detail and contrast your subject,
then finally add the conclusion, giving your thoughts, faults and facts.

Ask yourself this, OK it's just a hobby, but wouldn't you like to have the
best hobby you can.  That's what I believe <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> can do for me, but in
order to get that out, I have to put a little in, and I mean it IS only a
little.

So come on <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers, let's get together on this one at least.
There are so many methods of which you can submit your Correspondence and
Articles, so there's no excuse.  You will be letting down the whole BBS
Community if you don't give it a try.

Hendrix (SysOp Of <a href="innocentbbs.html">Innocent BBS</a>)
