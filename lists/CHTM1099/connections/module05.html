   <u>Electronica: Music Module Reviews - By Hendrix (SysOp Of Innocent BBS)</u>

  Module Title: Deliciously
 Module Author: Kure4Kancer
  Module Style: Euro Dance
Available From: AMINET (mods/k4k/delicious.lha)

This Module scores for technicality alone, although that's about all.  It's
got this excellent flange effect that comes in about half way through but
for no apparent reason.  Most annoyingly it has no major interest other than
that.  As one of AMINET's most recent uploads, amongst about 20 others from
the same author, I have to ask myself is this all that AMIGA musicians are
producing.  We want quality please!!!  It can be done.  This tune has that
typical European industrial techno sound to it, what I mean is this is
typical of what I would expect from the continent on 12&quot;.  Maybe it's just
not my cup of tea, but I'm left thinking...was it worth the download time?

<b>Commercial Viability:</b> 2/5
      <b>Style &amp; Groove:</b> 2/5
   <b>Sampling &amp; Timing:</b> 4/5

       <b>Module Rating:</b> 4/10
