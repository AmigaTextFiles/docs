<FONT FACE=DOM CASUAL> <font color=black>

Note that most of these games have been tested with a graphics-board.
I think that having a Cybervision (or some other GFX board with 
chunky-to-planar GFX conversion built-in) is <b> the most important
thing to have </b> if you are going to run SHAPESHIFTER. The second
most important thing would be an accelerated processor with local ram.
Either Cyberstorm, Warp Engine or even the old Excalibur. Finally I´ve
found that a faster CD-ROM and faster Hard Drive can go a long way
towards speeding up the Mac side.

To run most (68k-) Macintosh-Games fast enough I  recommend:

<p>


<table border=0>

<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>16 MB FastRAM (you should have at least 8 MB RAM for SHAPESHIFTER)</li>
<li>a Graphics-board like Cybervision64 or Picasso</li>
<li>Kickstart 3.1 speeds up the emulation a little bit</li>
<li>a 68040 with 25MHz (the faster the better!)</li>
<li>of course in many cases you could also use a 68020 with 14MHz or above,
but it´s no fun playing games with such a "slow" processor!</li>
<li>a fast (SCSI) Hard Drive</li>
<li>a fast (SCSI) CD-ROM Drive (4X and above)</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
