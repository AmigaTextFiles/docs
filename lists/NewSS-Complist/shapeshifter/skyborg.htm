Skyborg: Runs just fine on the Warp Engine, the action sequences  are
almost  impossible  on a stock '040 though. Not that much fun - but I
only paid $25 for it...

SkyBorg:  Adventure Game.  You are a robot who must travel into the
Microcosm, (a miniture universe where time is greatly accelerated) to
rescue your builder, Dr. Barton.  On the way, another robot, Morb, who was
also built by Dr. Barton, will be trying to stop you.  Morb has been
malfunctioning, and is no longer sane.  Gameplay is slow.  Your view of the
surroundings is not updated in real-time; rather, each time you take a step
a new view is loaded.  With very few interactive action sequences, this game
is mostly about finding all the pieces you need to get your ship working,
and flying around the planets of the Microcosm untill you find Dr. Barton.
