Iron Helix: You can play this on a stock 040, maybe even a fast  030.
Runs great on the Warp Engine. This one is similar to Skyborg in that
the pictures are all still-images. You move forward in steps, and the
picture  dissolves  to  the new viewpoint. (Well, in Iron Helix there
are a few frames blended to show movement forward; not a bad game)

Iron Helix:  Adventure Game.  You are a robot who has been dispatched to a
ship which has been infected with a deadly virus.  The crew is dead, but
a Doomsday Device, code-named Iron Helix, is still on board.  The ship's
main computer has taken control of the ship and will deploy the Iron Helix
device when the ship reaches it's destination.  You must stop the ship's
computer before this happens, otherwise an intergalactic war will result.
Gameplay consists mostly of exploring the many passageways of the ship
while avoiding the security robot.  Your view is updated with each step,
with a short video segment, but otherwise the display is static.  You must
collect DNA samples from the former crew in order to access various
terminals and doors.  Published by Spectrum Holobyte.
