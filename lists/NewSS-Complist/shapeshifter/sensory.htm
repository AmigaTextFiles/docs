<td width=550> Ugh! This is DOOM done super-cheap! Only 3 floppy disks
for the whole game. Not very pretty to look at - the graphics are very
plain and all the same. Still, it`s playable in tiny resolution on a stock
`040, and playable at full-screen on an accelerated 4000. Not much fun
though...</td>

<td valign=top>Sensory Overload:</td>
<td> First-person, Texture-mapped 3D Dungeon Game. Yet another Doom-like
game, this one is not as good as the rest. You are fighting terrorists inside
a large office complex. Graphics are not as detailed as other Doom-like games.
Only a few different weapons are available, and the entire game fits on only
3 floppy disks. Still, it is different in that most of the fighting is done in
close quarters. (Hallways and small rooms) Published by Reality Bytes.</td>
