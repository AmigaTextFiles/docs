<h3><b>
Havoc:</b></h3>
Playable on a stock 040 with reduced GFX and screen size. On an accelerated
machine you can bump up the size and some of the detail, but max resolution
and max detail slows it to a crawl even with a 40 MHz Warp Engine. Maybe an
`060 would handle it though...

<p>

<h3><b>
Havoc:</b></h3>
Tank Shoot-em-up. Fly your hovercraft close to the ground and blow up everything
in your path. Lots of action. The game has very good texture-mapped backgrounds,
but you need a VERY FAST machine to take advantage of this. Game also has provisions
for playing head-to-head via modem. Many different missions, several different types
of battle hovercraft. Published by Reality Bytes.
