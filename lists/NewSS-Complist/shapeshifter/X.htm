Needs 040. You have to turn off very much gfx-details even on 040/40MHz/Cybervision.
It really CRIES FOR a PowerPC ...

X-Wing: Space Shoot-em-up. Fly your X-Wing fighter on a multitude of missions
with other rebel forces to oppose the Empire. Great Star-Wars setting - good
graphics and sound. Gameplay is difficult without an joystick, but the X-Wing is
flyable from the keyboard. Over 120 combat scarios! Published by Lucas Arts.

Tested on: A4000 with Macro-System`s WARP ENGINE `040 running at 40 MHz Cybervision-64
(4-meg), Toshiba 6.7 speed SCSI-II CD-ROM, Amiga OS 3.1
