You may know that there are not too much games especially written for
the Amiga. Or think that there are about 40 or 50 new games for PC per
month, but only 1 or 2 will ever be converted. The Macintosh game scene
is far from being complete but some very good games will always be
converted to the Mac.

<p>

So why not using <B> SHAPESHIFTER </B> to run the Macintosh-games
that will never be available for Amiga-players? Here is the problem:<p>
<b> <i> "Is my hardware good enough to play this game???" </i> </b>

<p>

So I`m trying to collect as much information as possible on the subject:<p>
<b> <i> "What game needs what kind of hardware (RAM, processor,...)?" </i> </b>

<p>
