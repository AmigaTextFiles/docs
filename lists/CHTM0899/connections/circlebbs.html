 Very generous BBS...You have 255 minutes of online time per day/per call
 and you can download 100 files before having to upload anything...

       | The CIRCLE BBS online times and calling information:       |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       | Monday -&#062; Thursday : 00:00 -&#062; 07:00 hrs  : NORMAL DIALLING |
       |                                                            |
       | ALL OTHER TIMES    : The BBS uses RINGBACK (see below).    |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+

       (Normal dialling means:- just call as you would any other BBS)

 USING THE CIRCLE BBS RINGBACK:

 Call the BBS and let the phone ring once, immediately HANG UP.
 Wait 15-20 seconds for the BBS to be loaded.
 Call the BBS again and you'll be connected.
 Please don't just call it as normal - I'll think it's a voice call
 and you'll hear &quot;Hello?&quot; through your modem speaker! ;)
