   <u>The BBS Scene - By Philippa Armstong &quot;Pipa&quot; (SysOp Of Dark Domain BBS)</u>

I have been on the BBS Scene for 6 years now, and have seen a lot of
change.  <a href="darkdomainbbs.html">Dark Domain BBS</a> was started in 1993, back then there was a lot
of people on the BBS Scene, the BBS got a lot of Calls, and I didn't really
have to do much to get the Calls...BUT...things have changed!!!

I have sat here for months now, hoping that I would get some Callers to
<a href="darkdomainbbs.html">Dark Domain BBS</a>, and the result was no Callers at all!!!  I decided it was
time to change that, and the way to change it was by advertising, and
advertising in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> was the way to go about it!!!  <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> keeps
you in touch with all of the BBSes that are still running, and it lets you
speak your view and read what other people have to say, about the BBS Scene.

Waiting around for other people to call you won't work at all, you need
to get out there, make a few Calls yourself, and get involved with the BBS
Community.  Don't just sit back and hope that people will call you...THEY
WON'T!!!  I thought the BBS Scene was dead...but I was wrong.  Until
recently I didn't call anybody, then I started calling other SysOps, and
only then did I realise how many BBSes there were still running.  I started
advertising, and now Callers to <a href="darkdomainbbs.html">Dark Domain BBS</a> have picked up again :)

My point is, that I've found that the only way to keep the BBS Scene going,
is for us SysOps to join in with the BBS Community and advertise our BBSes,
but remember...you have to put something into the BBS Community, to get
things back from it!!!
