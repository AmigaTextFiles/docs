Hello <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers...

My name is Dave Clarke, and no doubt you are all asking &quot;Who the hell is
that?&quot;.  Well at the moment I'm slowly constructing &quot;The Clarke Site&quot; at
<a href="http://home.freeuk.net/davecl">http://home.freeuk.net/davecl</a> which is also the home of the First Official
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site, but in the past I have had a hand in making Dunkie the
man he is today (please don't kill me, I have a wife and kids :-)).

It was me that encouraged him to get an AMIGA, which I had at that time,
then I persuaded him to get a Hard-Drive and a Modem, neither of which he
thought he needed, then we helped each other set up BBS Software, but
unfortunately I was unable to go down this path, but Dunkie just went from
strength to strength, making <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a> the excellent BBS it is today!!!
I'm sure Sarah must hate me when I think about all the time and money that
Dunkie spends on his beloved AMIGA and <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a>, but we all need a hobby
and there are many worse things he could be doing.

Anyway, after my flirtings with my own BBS, I became a point off Bedlam BBS
in Leeds (now closed) and was the self-appointed Moderator of BED_FILTH,
which was not as you are thinking all about nude ladies, but was a general
chat area but with a slant, profanity, vulgarity, cursing and general
swearing were positively encouraged, indeed one of the rules was that your
message had to contain at least 2 swear words.  All this sounds very silly
now, but it was great fun at the time.  I also tried my hand at a bit of 3D 
Rendering, and one of my pics appeared on the back cover of AMIGA SHOPPER
Magazine.

All good things must come to an end, and due to personal and financial
problems, the trusty AMIGA A1200 had to go :(  This was about 2 years ago
and I thought my world had ended.  After spending a good 25-30 hours a week
(sometimes more) on the computer, I suddenly found I had nothing to do.
When finances allowed I got a Playstation, and although good for a quick
game or two it just wasn't the same, I hankered for a real computer.

In January of this year, I took the plunge, and as the AMIGA was to all
intents and purposes dead, I bought a PC (on the tick, not paid for and
probably never will be).  Of course during my absence BBSes have taken a
back-seat and the Internet is at the forefront, so rather than mess around
with BBS Software, I messed around with Web-Creators and when Dunkie asked
me if I wanted to help with <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, I jumped at the chance and the rest
as they say is history.

The BBS Scene is NOT dead as everybody thought, it is very much alive and
kicking, and I will be doing what I can to support it. It is much more
personal and enjoyable than the faceless Internet.  When you log-on to a BBS
you are logging on (in most cases) to a computer in someone's home, the
computer that they use and tend everyday, and a lot of the time they are sat 
watching what you are doing, ready to jump in and help if you get stuck or
to chat to you when you want (or even if you don't want...eh Dunkie?).  The
growth of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is testimony to the BBS Scene, and to the dedication
of SysOps and Co-SysOps like Dunkie and Sarah, who will not let it die.

Long live BBSes!!!

Jesus what a load of waffle I've written, Dunkie only wanted a few lines,
I'm getting as bad as him.  Thanks for reading my inane ramblings...

Cya...
