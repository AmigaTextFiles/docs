&quot;<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is great...there are loads of BBSes in there that I never knew
existed!!!  I think it's great what you're doing, and my BBS has picked up
since you helped me :)))&quot;

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is pleased to hear that yet again, we've delivered the goods,
and like we promised, <a href="darkdomainbbs.html">Dark Domain BBS</a> has picked up since you advertised in
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has obviously convinced YOU, that we can turn
things around for UK BBSes if you advertise in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, it's just the
rest of the UK SysOps we have to convince now!!!  Hopefully Correspondence,
like yours above, will help in our struggle to convince SysOps to advertise
their BBSes.  Its constructive Correspondence like yours that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">
welcomes, and we're sure that you are not alone in benefitting from the
effects of advertising in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  If there are any SysOps out there,
who HAVE benefitted from advertising in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, then please get in
touch.  <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> needs YOUR help, if we are to overcome this mountain
we have to climb to ensure the UK BBS Scene's survival.  Thanks again!!!

&quot;<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is an excellent idea!!!  It's true what you say about the
Internet taking the Callers away, but I feel that Users will be back, as the
BBS Scene gives you a 1-2-1 touch, which the Internet doesn't really do.  I
used to have loads of people logging-on everyday, but I only average now one
User a day :(  I do kick myself really, as I don't really advertise my BBS.
Hopefully <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> will help.  It's good to know someone is out there to
help...keep up the good work!!!&quot;

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> would aid you better m8, if you were to submit an ASCII (Text)
Advert for Hellfire BBS.  For example, if you had submitted an Advert for
this Issue, your BBS would have been linked to your Correspondence, like the
previous Correspondence above, and would have drawn Readers' attention more
so than just your SysOp Name and BBS underneath your Correspondence.  We
hope you'll take notice of this fact, and submit your BBS Advert in time for
the next Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.

&quot;In the last 2 years of running a BBS, I have found the BBS Scene starting
to become a thing of the past.  Well I personally think we can revive the
BBS Scene with the help and support of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  It is certainly a
breath of fresh air, to see someone with the noddle to start something as
kewl as <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, to give us SysOps a chance in running a successful and
prosperous Bulletin Board System.  Nice one guys...keep up the good work!!!&quot;
