 Graffiti Card Error List v1.0
 =============================

 This is a little list of games, which aren`t compatible
 with the Graffiti Card. An example, how your games can 
 look, if they`re not compatible with the Graffiti Card
 is included.

 Ok, here`s the list:

 Games: 

 <all games programmed in BlitzBasic, which use a Slice>
 Erben der Erde
 J.B. - The Game
 Pang
 Unreal 
 Wiz`n Liz


 Programs:

 BlitzBasic2 (try to open a slice)


 That was it! If you know other games/progs, which aren`t
 compatible, email me: softwarefailure@dame.de

 You can contact me via Snailmail too: Andreas Falkenhahn
				       An der Trift 2
				       36132 Eiterfeld-Arzell
				       GERMANY
 
 Start the example now & look if you`ve some games which look
 so. If you`ve, turn off your Grafitti Card and try it again,
 if it works now, you`ve found an incompatible game.

 Have fun,

          Andreas
