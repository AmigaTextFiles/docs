		very simple (uses ascii headers to separate files).
		From Decus C distribution. Author: Martin Minow

xrf		C cross reference utility. Originally from Decus C
		distribution. Author: Bob Denny

		"raw" disk read/write. Author Rob Peck 12/1/85

CONTENTS OF DISK 6
==================

compress	Compress reduces the size of the named files using
		adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding. The amount of compression
		obtained depends on the size of the input, the number
		of bits per code, and the distribution of common
		substrings. Typically, text such as source code or
		English is reduced by 50-60%. Compression is generally
		much better then that achieved by Huffman coding (as
		used in "pack") or adaptive Huffman coding (as used in
		"compact"), and takes less time to compute. Great for
		saving disk space, or reducing transmission time over
		phone lines! Also includes "btoa" and "atob" for
		converting binary files to ascii, and then back to
		binary (for transmission over links that do not support
		8 bits). Author: Thomas Spencer, with improvements by
		others

dadc		A digital computer impersonating an analog clock
		impersonating a digital clock. Author: Perry S.
		Kivolowitz

microemacs	An upgraded version of microemacs originally
		distributed on disk number 2. I don't have an exact
		list of changes but the new executable is about 25%
		larger, so there must be something in there! One
		enhancement is that some functions are now also bound
		to function keys. Author: Dave Conroy, with
		enhancements by Jack Roose.

mult		Mult reads the input comparing adjacent lines. In the
		normal case, the second and succeeding copies of
		repeated lines are output, and the remainder of the
		lines are removed. Repeated lines must be adjacent in
		order to be found. Options are present to output the
		first of multiple lines, for comparing adjacent lines
		by field only, and for specifying the field separator
		character. Kind of the opposite of the Unix "uniq"
		program. Author: Dennis Bednar

scales		Demonstrates use of the Audio functions in the ROM to
		produce four voice sound. It uses a simple waveform
		(sawtooth) with no amplitude control (ie, envelope) or
		frequency variation (ie, vibrato), but these can be
		easily implemented. Also includes considerable
		documentation on audio device. Author: Steven A.
		Bennett

setparallel	Allows the CLI user to dynamically change any
		particular parallel port parameter. Author: Keith
		Stobie and Tom Pohorsky

setserial	Allows the CLI user to dynamically change any
		particular serial port parameter. Author: Keith Stobie
		and Tom Pohorsky

sortc		A quicksort based sort program, using separate driver
		and sort modules. Originally from a DECUS C
		distribution. Claims to be fast, but when operating
		entirely out of ram takes 93 seconds to sort its input
		file, sort.c, while AmigaDos's sort takes only 43
		seconds under the same conditions. Author: Dave Conroy,
		Martin Minow, and Ray Van Tassle

stripc		Strips comments and extraneous whitespace from C source
		files. Useful for compacting the C header files to
		increase usable disk space. Author: Chris Metcalf

		Free Software Foundation. This is a working update to
		the version on disk number 4, provided by Johan Widen.
		Author: Bob Corbett and Richard Stallman

Compress	This is an update to the compress version released on
		disk number 6. It is tested and seems to work well
		except for a couple glitches noticed at the last minute

		named files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding. The
		amount of compression obtained depends on the size of
		the input, the number of bits per code, and the
		distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such
		as source code or English is reduced by 50-60%.
		Compression is generally much better then that achieved
		by Huffman coding (as used in "pack") or adaptive
		Huffman coding (as used in "compact"), and takes less
		time to compute. Author: Thomas Spencer, with
		improvements by others

Cos		A "Wheel Of Fortune" style game in AmigaBasic. Author:

		to be really useful as anything other than a learning
		tool for budding compiler guru's. Author: Matthew
		Brandt

SpreadSheet	A simple "Visicalc-like" spread sheet calculator. Also
		known as "vc" but there is currently a debate about
		whether or not that name is a registered trademark. The

		source code. Author: James Gosling, Mark Weiser, and
		Bob Bond Amiga port by Dave Wecker

TarSplit	A port of the OS/9 program that extracts files from
		Unix tar archives. Author: James Jones. Amiga version

===================

Hack		This disk contains a port of the popular UNIX game
		"Hack", done by John Toebes and the crew at the
		Software Distillery. This is version 1.0.3D. Note that
		this disk must be named "Hack_Game". I have elected to
		keep that name, rather than using the usual
		"AmigaLibDiskXX" convention for disks in my library, to
		avoid requiring users to rename the disk before using
		it.

CONTENTS OF DISK 63
===================

Larn		This disk contains a port of the popular UNIX game
		"Larn", done by Edmund Burnette and the crew at the
		Software Distillery. This is version 12.0B. Note that
		this disk must be named "Larn". I have elected to keep
		that name, rather than using the usual "AmigaLibDiskXX"
		convention for disks in my library, to avoid requiring
		users to rename the disk before using it.

CONTENTS OF DISK 64
===================

Developer's IFF	This is a copy of the Amiga Developer's IFF
		disk, received directly from Commodore-Amiga sources,
		with permission to place in the library and
		redistribute. It is an update to disk number 16, and is
		unchanged except for:

CONTENTS OF DISK 65
===================

Bawk		Text processor inspired by the Unix awk utility. Bawk
		searches files for specific patterns and performs
		actions for every occurance of these patterns. The
		patterns can be regular expressions. The actions are
		expressed using a subset of the C language.
		Unfortunately this version always gets a stack overflow
		no matter what the stack is set to, I haven't had a
		chance to find the bug. Includes source, so you can
		hunt for it. Looks like it could be a very useful
		utility for the Amiga. Author: Bob Brodt

CloseWB		Simple program for use with MWB (also on this disk) to
		close a current WorkBench screen, and let you open
		WorkBench on a custom screen. Author: Matt Dillon

Cookie		Fortune cookie program. Includes source. Author:

		menus. It takes a simple text file and generates a C
		source file with all the needed structures for linking
		with the rest of your program. This is version 1.0, and
		includes source. Author: A. Preston

MWB		A program which will create a new 'WorkBench' screen
		and route by request OpenWindow calls meant for the
		WorkBench to these new screens. This allows you to run
		programs which normally open windows on the WorkBench
		screen to use a custom screen instead. Version 1.01,
		includes source. Author: Matt Dillon

NewPackets	Tutorial downloaded from BIX C-A support section, which
		describes some new packets and structures in 1.2
		AmigaDos. Author: Carolyn Scheppner

PascalToC	A Pascal to C translator program which is supposed to
		correctly handle function, procedure, and most type
		declarations. However, this quick and dirty port didn't
		fare too well on even a simple little Pascal fragment
		from Software Tools in Pascal. I don't know if the
		problem is machine dependencies in the code or bugs.
		Looks like it could be useful with a little more work
		than I have time to put into it now. Includes source.
		Author: James Mullens, enhancements by Dan Kegel

Prep		Version 2.1 of a Fortran preprocessor called 'prep', an
		alternative to ratfor. Prep has better macro
		facilities, a concise shorthand for array and vector

		forth, and is written in generic, portable C (I made no
		source changes). Includes source. Author: Roger Ove

RunBack		A program that allows you to start another program
		which is independent of the CLI window. This is useful
		to start programs from your Startup-Sequence, load

CONTENTS OF DISK 68
===================

MicroGNUEmacs	This diskette contains the latest Amiga version of
		MicroGNUEmacs (MG 1b), a small but powerful text editor
		that also runs on many other computer systems besides
		the Amiga. One of MG's major goals is to be compatible
		with its "cousin" GNU Emacs, so certain features you
		may have seen in other versions of MicroEmacs may work
		differently here, or not exist. Hopefully, you'll find
		the added features MG provides to be worth the trouble
		it takes to make the switch. As well as the commands
		available on *all* systems MG supports, Amiga MG has
		many Amiga-specific features: the Amiga mouse (with 24
		different functions!), Intuition pull-down menus, the
		Browser (a very nice way to select files), Amiga
		function keys, a full-screen editing window, and
		support for using a different text font in the editing
		window. The current version is known to run on the
		following systems: 4.2 & 4.3 BSD Unix, Sun 3.2; Ultrix-
		32 (BSD Unix); OS9/68k; VMS; Amiga; System V; Eunice;
		Primos; Cpm/68k; Atari ST MicroGNUEmacs is based on the
		original work of Dave Conroy, author of the public
		domain v30 version. It has been greatly enhanced
		through the efforts of the following people:
		mwm@ucbopal.berkeley.edu (Mike Meyer),
		mic@ngp.utexas.edu (Mic Kaczmarczik), blarson@usc-
		eclb.arpa (Bob Larson), rtech!daveb@sun.com (Dave
		Brower) (previous version)

CONTENTS OF DISK 104
====================

AnalytiCalc	AnalytiCalc is a large and powerful spreadsheet program
		with sufficient extra features to have some pretentions
		of acting as an "integrated system". It is a virtual
		memory system supporting up to 18000 columns and 18000
		rows, multiple equations per cell, an outlining system,
		built-in cell annotation, and datafile access from any
		cell(s) of the sheet, plus an array of functions not
		present in most commercial spreadsheets. This disk
		represents the initial Amiga port of AnalytiCalc, and
		as such the console interface is somewhat crude and in
		addition requires use of a custom keymap (one such is
		supplied) for sensible operation. This will be improved
		upon, but meanwhile the program is released with
		complete sources, documents, and executables. The
		graphics program and the DIF file access program are
		not yet ported; these will be released when they are
		ready. AnalytiCalc for the Amiga uses files compatible
		with those for AnalytiCalc on MS-DOS, VMS, or RSX-11M
		or IAS. An example project planner spreadsheet is
		included in the distribution to show off some of the
		things you can do. More example sheets will be
		forthcoming in the future. AnalytiCalc also supports
		matrix math, FFTs, infinite windowing, linear
		regression, date arithmetic, internal and external
		macros, LOTS of cell addressing modes, goal seeking in
		up to 8 dimensions, and more. AnalytiCalc requires
		perhaps 600K of RAM memory, at least one 360K diskette
		drive, and AmigaDOS 1.2, plus a larger than default
		stack. Display sizes supported can be up to 132
		characters wide by up to 76 lines long. Sorry; I don't
		think AnalytiCalc supports proportional fonts very
		well, though it should manage not to be totally brain
		damaged with them. The manual requires an 80 column
		printer.

		ovation. It is a "must see" for every Amiga user, and
		ranks up there with "Juggler" as a premier demo for the
		Amiga. The difference between this distribution, and
		the one on disk 100, is that this one includes
		"source". I.E. it contains all the object descriptions
		necessary to recreate the animation. Thus you can, if
		you like, try modifying various objects to create
		slightly different animations, or use it as an example
		for creating your own animations. Author: Leo Schwab

		disk devices and eliminates addmem commands from your
		startup sequence. Version 2.0, includes source. Author:
		Dave Williams

MoreIsBetter	These two hacks make MORE more useful. One is called V;
		it's a small "pure" CLI command that acts as a front
		end for More, causing it to create its own window. Make
		V and More both resident! The other is Fenestrate,
