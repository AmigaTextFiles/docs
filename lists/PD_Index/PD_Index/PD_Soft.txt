^+  V0107   FUTURE COMPOSER MUSIC PROGRAM
    The Future-Composer was build around the Thalion 
    music replay routine and was written by Supersero 
    of the Superions, On this disk you can find the 
    sound-modules from the games Astaroth and 
    Chambers of Shaolin (and a another tune by 
    thalion). All the modules can ofcourse be loaded 
    into the FUTURE-COMPOSER, where you can play or 
    edit the tunes. You can of course also grab 
    instruments for your own musics. The replayer has 
    been optimized, and the portamento routine has 
    been totally rewritten. All portamento action in 
    the modules has ofcourse been changed to work 
    with the new portamento routine. The 
    Future-composer is not just another soundtracker, 
    it's more like the competition that will wipe it 
    out!

^+  V0123   RIM THE DATABASE
    Relational Information Manager, RIM is a 
    relational DBMS which is the ancestor of the 
    Rbase databases and the various commercial RIMs. 
    It is presented here complete, with all sources, 
    courtesy of Glenn Everhart. This is a port to 
    Amiga of the port from VMS to IBM PC, and as such 
    has still a fairly crude user interface. The 
    saving grace of RIM is that it is suitable for 
    VERY large databases, using B-Tree data storage, 
    and that RIM has a program interface. That is, if 
    you don't like the way RIM handles data input 
    and/or reporting, you can replace it with your 
    own. The included documents give the complete 
    story on this.

    accounts receivable, accounts payable and general 
    ledger. As a small business owner and Amiga 
    afficianado, I thought it was time to do 
    something besides complain about the lack of PD 
    business software for the Amiga.  So I created 
    the Clerk as an answer to my computing needs and 
    hopefully yours. Now that major parts of the 
    program have been in general use for several 
    months, I feel it is mostly bug free. I have 
    stuck with my original goal of keeping it simple 
    to use and straight forward.

    system you use the ArpInstall program. This 
    program can be run from either the Workbench (by 
    clicking on its Icon) or if you prefer, from the 
    CLI. This program uses a simple mouse driven 
    interface to install the ARP CLI style commands 
    on your system. You can select the commands you 
    want, and where you want them placed on your disk,
     or you can elect to accept the default setup.

    WordSync.  The program does multitask, but do not 
    use programs which will access the disk during 
    the optimization or its crash city.  REORG, Is a 
    fast disk optimizer that can be used for floppy 
    disks and hard disks. Supports new Kickstart 2.04 
    features including hard and soft links, and

------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1045   UDRAW V1.0
    A drafting tool that is bitmap oriented rather 
    than object oriented.  The original intent with 
    UDraw was to provide a mechanism for the rapid 
    drawing of schematic diagrams.  However, UDraw 
    has applications beyond this original intent. 
    Makes heavy use of clip boards, files which 
    contain clips of various items that are displayed 
    simultaneously but behind the work area, parts of 
    which can be lifted off and pasted to the working 
    screen.  Author:  Ron Stefkovich.

    format so will work with any Tracker program or 
    even Med programs.  
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1047   SOUND UTILITIES
    CHIPMANIA RIPPER v1.0, Well, the idea was to code 
    a tool, which is able to save all the modules in 
    $CEPTIC's Chipmania while being executed one time 
    only. This means that you don't have to save all 
    modules one after another like a normal ripper 
    would do. Just start my ripper and wait until all 
    the modules are saved.  Without any doubt 
    $CEPTIC's Chipmania is really cool. The only 
    negative point is, that there isn't any save 
    option included. They give informations where you 
    can find the module and how long it is, but you 
    cannot save the module.  BUCEFALO v2.0, is a very 
    short utility created for all swappers. Its 
    features are very similar to Swappit's features, 
    but there is something more.  OPTIMOD v4.0, is a 
    utility to optimize NoiseTracker and ProTracker 
    modules. All modules must be in the 31 
    instruments fileformat and be a 
    ProTracker/NoiseTracker module. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1048   HAM-8 VISTAS
    This is a small collection of Ham8 vistas saved 
    in Jpeg format in order to save disk space. They 
    were created using an Amiga 4000/40 and took 
    around thirty minutes each from start to finish. 
    In order to achieve ham8 images from software 
    that as of now dosn't yet support it, I first ran 
    off tests in low fract ham then when satisfied 
    with the framing I created the final image in 
    DCTV format and saved it as Iff24. Then using 
    adpro2 I loaded and converted it into ham8 
    saveing in Jpeg format onto disk. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1049   HAM-8 VISTAS 2
    This is the second and probably last of these 
    disks that I shall do. As its bloody boring 
    watching all these landscapes get generated, and 
    anyway i've recently purchase Imagine 2.0 with 
    essence textures, which is far more interesting 
    to play around with. Incidentally as I get a 
    handle on Imagine I shall be releasing various 
    objects and Images into the public domain to keep 
    all you lasy or Amiga unendowed to get in on the 
    action. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1050   VIDI EFFECTS

    being considered. 
------------------------------------------------------
^*  V1051   EASY CALC PLUS
    is a spreadsheet designed to be both easy to use 
    and fast.  If the program looks nice, that 
    wouldn't to be bad either.  Unlike other software 
    where the author writes the program first, then 
    bolts on a help system, I have designed the help 
    into the program from the beginning.  A major 
    design goal was to produce a spreadsheet that 
    would leave all those slow Amiga ones (commercial 
    and PD) behind.  Even if you only have a 68000 
    Amiga with 1.3 you should find that you are never 
    left waiting for the screen to redraw or 
    recalculate.  If you have an A1200 or simular 
    then it flies! 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1052   EXCEL LIBRARY BOOK CATALOGUE 3
    The original specification was to program a quick 
    and easy  user  interface for  the storage and 
    retrieval of specific data on library books to be 
    used by librarians and/or customers.  The new 
    specification is to create a quick and  easy  
    user  interface  with which to store and retrieve 
    data of variable field and record size.

    support long text lines, can add disks directly 
    from unedited email or usenet announcements, can 
    remove disks, rebuild a damaged index, find next 
    or previous software versions, print or export 
    (parts of) the database, and more.  Includes a 
    database of disks 1-840.  Author:  Udo Schuermann

    based on ASDG's 'VD0:'.  ASDG-RAM has been 
    reliable for many years since it was placed in 
    the PD.  However it has always been slow because 
    it uses OFS, or old file system.  On an 
    accelerated machines, SD0:  is up to 7 times 
    faster, and averages 5 times faster than the 
    original VD0:.  It's also 4 to 5 times faster

    run.  2) Degrader, will automatly turn off 
    Workbench 3.0s CPU Cache and then after use turn 
    it back on again.  3) FakeMem, Now FakeMem takes 
    us in athoer direction it fools the A1200 into 
    thinking it has half meg chip RAM and one and a 
    half megs of fast RAM!.  When Degrader and 
    FastMem are uses combined you'll find that even 
    more older programs will work.

    determine whether or not you actually need some 
    of these space-consuming things.  Author Dan 
    Elgaard. Also contains GUIDE2DOC v1.0

^+  V1311   CDROM SOFTWARE
    CDTV-PLAYER:  A utility for all those people, 
    who'd like to play Audio-CD's, while multitasking 
    on workbench.   PLAY CDDA:  is a program for 
    owners of Toshiba 3401 CDROM drives.  These 
    drives are capable of transferring CD-DA (digital 
    audio) data over the SCSI bus. PlayCDDA reads 
    this data and reproduces the corresponding sounds 
    on the Amiga's audio.device.  PlayCDDA 
    communicates with the user over a simple 
    graphical interface.  Basically, you have to 
    click at the button for the track you want to 
    hear, and PlayCDDA starts playing this track on 
    your Amiga's loudspeaker.  READDCTV:  This 
    program converts DCTV pictures to 24-bit ILBM 
    IFF's.  To use it, just type 'ReadDCTV dctvfile 
    iff24file'.  It should work on pre-2.0 systems, 
    but it does require iffparse.library.  It also 
    requires at least v3 of dctv.library.  Author 
    Garrick Meeker. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1312   HPII [PROGRAMMABLE CALCULATOR]
    This program emulates an HP11C calculator.  
    Everything is there, including the program mode 
    (with the instructions displayed as usual, as 
    numbers ...).  By default, it's even as slow.  It 
    is callable from Workbench or CLI.  Basically, 
    the program opens a window containing an image of 
    an HP11C.  You select keys with the mouse or the 
    keyboard, the following keys are supported:  0..9,
    .,+,-,*,/,return (for enter), esc (for ON). 
------------------------------------------------------
^*  V1313   GBLANKER
    Garshneblanker is a complete modular screen 
    blanking package designed with AmigaDOS 2.04+ in 
    mind. This software takes advantage of all the 
    new features of ADOS 2.04+ in order to make it as 
    upward compatible with new releases as possible. 
    A few of the features are listed below: Screen 
    Mode Database use in each module, Full 
    Commodities interface, Font sensitive window, 
    Public screen support, GadTools interface, IFF 
    Preferences files, Use of tool types to support 
    global and local prefs, AppWindow support, AGA 
    Support in all modules! (Beautiful 256 color 
    displays). Author Michael D. Bayne. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1314   LASER JET 4 SOFTWARE
    This driver is virtually identical to CBM'S 
    HP_LaserJet driver in it's text handling 
    capabilities.  The only difference here are in 
    the commands sent to the printer when doing the 
    text mode initialization.  CBM's driver had a 
    couple of commands meant for the HP DeskJet and I 
    nuked them from my driver.  They were the 
    commands to set Font Quality (draft or letter) 
    and Font Placement (normal, superscript, or 
    subscript).  These commands could be put back in 
    if demand warrants it.  Author Kelly Jordan. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1315   TRAPDOOR
    There are not really too many new features in 
    this release (well, there are the one or two 
    things that slipped in :-), like KS 2.04 public 
    screens, enhanced accounting, fax software 
    support, etc.), but mainly we have spent some 
    literally months on fixing two weird bugs.  One 
    was in the EMSI handshake, quite a few of you 
    have seen those 0:0/0.0 addresses andEMSI 
    failures in the past...  that's past and gone now.
      The other one is hopefully fixed and that's the 
    duplicate file sending bug in the ZedZap routines.
      This has been _really_ though to find.  I'm 
    still not 100% sure if it's absolutly flawless 
    now, but I'm quite confident it will give you 
    less trouble than before ;-). 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1316   COMIC COLLECTOR
    an easy to use database system for both serious 
    and not so serious comic collectors.  This 
    shareware version has two titles enabled, namely 
    DAZZLER & DEFENDERS and you can maintain a 
    database for these two titles.  Author M J 
    Thompson. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1317   TURBO TAPE 64
    This program converts C64 programs from tape 
    (TURBO TAPE 64).  To use them from C64 emulators 
    like TheA64Package when you have no C64 with 
    datasette and floppy, digitize the file you want 
    to convert with a sound digitizer and a program 
    like Audiomaster with maximal sample rate (more 
    than 40 kHz). Then zoom to the start (Audiomaster 
    shows a length of 599 Bytes) an cut the tape 
    noise at the start so that you can hear the sync 
    signal clearly.  It doesn't matter if you cut 1/3 
    of the sync signal, but the sound sample must 
    start directly with the sync signal; that means 
    that you can see waves that are repeating seven 
    little and one bigger waves.  It is not important 
    if it starts with a bigger wave or one of the 
    lower waves, but you *must* be able to differ 
    series of 7 lower and one higher wave.  If you 
    have cutted the start of the sample as described, 
    save the sample, which can now (hopefully) be the 
    input of D64. 
------------------------------------------------------
^^  V1318   (AGA) MULTI MEDIA
    Unlike a lot of Commercially available images, 
    The Images on this disk are all in MAXIMUM 
    OVERSCAN, and were produced in 128 colour mode, 
    using 64 colours, leaving an additional 64 
    colours for additional Text and cosmetic effects. 
     Another possible use is as WORKBENCH 3.0 
    Backdrops but I suggest that if you use them for 
    this purpose, and have limited memory then you 
    should convert them to Non-OverScan and into 64 
    Colour Mode, as a 128 colour Workbench eats up a 
    lot of valuable memory.  Additional Backdrops, 
    and separate Pre-Defined Palettes are available 
    from the Author S Hazel. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1319   MAXILIFE
    MaxiLife enables you to take control over your 
    finances, so that you can reach your goals and 
    maximise your lifestyle.  It does this by 
    projecting your financial situation, for to to 
    100 years.  If the out come is not ideal, you can 
    alter your details untill the optimum is achieved.
     Spendwize is a tool to assist you in maximising 
    your return from your day to day outgoing.  If 
    your expenses prevent you from reaching your 
    goals, Spendwise will suggest ways to alter these 
    expenses. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1320   GOLF GURU V1.2
    This program was written to record and analyse 
    your golf throughout the season.  As with all 
    analysis, the results can only be as good as the 
    data input and this is where I hope Golf Guru 
    will help.  By making the input of data easy and 
    the output interesting I hope you'll find that 
    your golf will improve - in fact my big statement 
    of this document is that I'll guarantee that if 
    you use this program properly then it WILL 
    improve your golf. Author Alan Bilsborough. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1321   EDWORD PRO V4.1
    EdWord is an extremely powerful, general purpose 
    text editor which offers a host of useful and 
    helpful facilities.  It was initially released as 
    a Shareware program, but since that time it has 
    undergone a myriad of improvements and updates 
    resulting in the current version which provides 
    an indispensable aid for every Amiga user.  As 
    you might expect, the basic function of EdWord is 
    to edit text and in this role, it offers all the 
    rudimentary facilities which any text editor 
    might offer, but what makes EdWord that bit more 
    special are the extra options which it provides. 
    Author Martin Reddy. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1322   PROBASE V1.1
    Is a very professional Amos programed database 
    with all the standard features.  An excellent

------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1323   AMOS SCREEN V1.0
    Is a Image Processing Utility created using AMOS. 
     Please don't be put off, simply because 
    AMOScreen was created in AMOS, no siree, 
    AMOScreen can beat MOST commercial Image 
    Processors in a few ways.  Author C D Harrison. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1324   POINT MANAGER
    Point Manager is a Tosser, Scanner and Editor for 
    any Amiga Point.  Even though PM performs so many 
    tasks, you will need a good Mailer (eg TrapDoor 
    [V1315]).  PM actually integrates all tasks you 
    can perform with any Tosser/Scanner and Editor, 
    and beyond that you will find some extra 
    utilities that you won't find in any other 
    program. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1325   TRANS NIB V1.00
    TransNib is a fast, simple parallel data transfer 
    protocol.  It was designed to make linking any 
    type of machine to any other type as easy as 
    possible.  All that is required is six 5V I/O 
    lines at each end.  It doesn't matter how fast or 
    slow each machine is, as the protocol uses a 
    two-line handshake procedure, ensuring the two 
    machines cannot possibly go out of sync.  Any two 
    computers supporting the TransNib v1.00 protocol 
    can be linked.  So far, front-ends for the 
    TransNib v1.00 protocol exist for the Amiga and 
    the Commodore 64.  Author Matt Francis. 
------------------------------------------------------

    transfer commercial software is a breach of a 
    licensing agreement - in exactly the same way as 
    making unauthorized copies by any other mechanism.
      In order to transfer files to which you are 
    legitimately entitled, you will need a serial 
    cable to run between the BBC's RS423 port and the 
    Amiga's RS232 port.

^+  V1352   MUSIC 2 TAB
    Tablature (TAB) is a system of writing down music 
    for the guitar as well as for other fretted 
    instruments.  It has existed in various forms 
    through the centuries and has been used for folk, 
    flamenco, lute and most importantly ROCK music.  
    It simply sets out the fingerings for a piece of 
    music/lead riffs in a sort of shorthand.  The 
    system relies on you being able to hear a piece 
    of music so that you are familiar with the 
    rhythmic structure of the piece and the timing of 
    the individual notes.  In other words, it is used 
    in conjunction with the memory.  Compared with 
    music notation it is easy to understand. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1353   TEXTPLUS V5.0

^+  V1354   FIVE-STAR V1.0
    Demo version of a powerful prediction tool for 
    LOTTO, POOLS, SWEEP, DIGIT (eg 4d) and HORSE 
    (races) systems available worldwide.  The program 
    uses an identical framework for all five systems 
    but they are run completely individually so that 
    any number of them can be used simultaneously.  
    All records, updates, predictions, bets and 
    results are stored separately and can be saved to 
    disk or sent to the printer at any time.  This 
    demo version is supplied with a very basic manual 
    and is completely functional except for data 
    input.  Binary only.  Author Joe Taylor.

    disk errors from floppy disks and hard disks, so 
    these disks can then be used without DOS showing 
    read/write errors.  Physical errors are actual 
    hard errors on the disk surface.  These errors 
    will not format.  On floppy disks this normally 
    means that you throw the disk away.  On some hard 
    disks, you can remap these areas to good areas.  
    NoErrors overcomes this problem by allocating 
    these areas to a file, and writing this file to 
    the disk.  DOS will never look at these areas 
    unless specifically requested, but as the file 
    name of the file is an unprintable character this 
    will never occur.  Author Nic Wilson.

^+  V1357   CITIZEN PRINT MANAGER
    The Citizen Print Manager has been designed in 
    conjunction with Irseesoft and has many of the 
    features of Turbo Print Professional .The Print 
    Manager will work with V1.2 Workbench and upwards.
      The Citizen version allows you to obtain the 
    superb prints that you have seen tailored to suit 
    the Citizen range of products .  Citizen has 
    chosen the defaults so that you do not need to 
    make any changes except to tell the program which 
    printer you have connected.  If you do wish to 
    experiment a short description of the functions 
    is given below.

^+  V1358   10 OUT OF 10 MATHS
    is a suite of six educational games designed to 
    help children get to grips with 36 specific 
    topics from the Mathematics National Curriculum 
    Attainment Target 2.  While covering these - and 
    automatically recording the child's progress - it 
    also covers many more areas essential both in 
    real life and for academic success.  The games 
    are both educational and fun with many elements 
    built in to keep children coming back for more.  
    There are, for example, two ways that a child can 
    see progress: 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1359   EPU V1.4
    Double your hard drive capacity by installing EPU.
      After installing EPU to any Device(HardDisk,
    Floppy,Rad etc) every file which will be written 
    to the device will be compressed and when any 
    compressed file is read by any application it 
    will be autmaticaly decompresed.  EPU is very 
    easy to install or remove, its size is very small,
     can work with many compress libraries like lh.
    library or xpk(NUKE,...).  The file sizes are not 
    limited by memory, (maximal file size is about 
    1GB).  There are no differences or limitations 
    when you are working with installed  epu or 
    without it(of course it can be slower if the CPU 
    is slow.)

^*  V1360   WORKBENCH 2.0 TUTORIAL
    If you are new to the Amiga - WELCOME!  There is 
    a lot more options open to you than just playing 
    games.  In the chapters Files Explained & Menus I 
    will attempt to explain the workings of Workbench 
    2,as the manuals supplied with your Amiga 
    (Although being thorough & informative) can be 
    more of a hindrence than a help.In the following 
    Chapters,I will break down the makings of 
    Workbench and make them more understandable to 
    the user.

^^  V1361   (AGA) 16-COLOUR ICONS
    These icons were beautifully drawn by Roger McVey,
     and I must add that the originals are the best 
    icons I have seen on any system.  However, I 
    tried them out on my 3.0 A4000 and the colors 
    were all messed up.  I attempted to fix them 
    using the 3.0 IconEdit, but since it doesn't 
    allow you to use 16 colors, I didn't have much 
    success. Undaunted, I came up with the idea of 
    using IconEdit from the WB 2.04 release.  Voila!  
    It worked, and after MANY hours of recoloring, Mr.
     McVey's icons are now a part of my 3.0 system.

^+  V1363   ROLE PLAYERS ASSISTANT
    BASICIMP v1.56:  Is a freeware AD&D play-time 
    dungeon master's assistant.  The version you see 
    here is a pre-release of the program in 
    AmigaBASIC.  Right now it will take characters in 
    a text file and load them in to be displayed at 
    will.  It also rolls dice and has a handy-dandy 
    encounter screen that will keep track of monsters 
    and their current hit points.  The program will 
    also load in characters generated with SSI's 
    Dungeon Master's Assistant Volume II.  A game 
    clock is also provided to keep track of game time.

------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1364   MAND2000D
    Is meant to be nothing less than the finest 
    Mandelbrot exploration program available on any 
    computer.  We have attempted to combine speed, 
    power and simplicity with a few unique features, 
    all designed to make it easy for you to discover 
    uncharted regions of the Mandelbrot and Julia 
    sets.  What makes Mand2000 different?  Point and 
    click animated zooming is the most intuitive way 
    of exploring the Mandelbrot and Julia sets that 
    we could think of. It's as easy as using a zoom 
    lens on a camera.  And to the best of our 
    knowledge no one else uses this method.  Mand2000 
    also lets you make Mandelbrot Zoom movies.  
    Instead of wasting time, disk space, and memory 
    to calculate every frame in the animation, 
    Mand2000 optionally calculates the key frames and 
    fills in the intermediate frames at playback.  
    The result: Movies are calculated about ten times 
    faster and take far less space on disk. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1365   CDTV-PLAYER V2.31
    A utility for all those people, who'd like to 
    play Audio CD's while multitasking on WorkBench.

    is a little more sophisticated.  Allows access to 
    the archive even without a CDROM drive (i.e.  
    AMIGA 500-4000), although you can't play a CD.  
    Program and KARAOKE (live on-screen) included.  
    Recognizes CDs automatically.  Works on all CDTVs,
     AMIGA CD 32 and all CD ROM emulating the cdtv.
    device or cd.device.  Author:  Daniel Amor.

    of your bank account.  You are advised to make a 
    back-up and work only from the copy.  
    Cheque-Mate!  can hold up to 1000 entries which 
    should be enough for most people in one year.  
    After this time you should make a new database, 
    see below for further details.  Author Peter 
    Harris.

!+  V1368   RSA ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
    The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption algorithm is 
    one of several recently developed techniques for 
    encryption which put immensely secure encryption 
    within reach of the home computer user.  This 
    software was written starting with the following 
    objectives:  (a) The highest possible level of 
    text security should be made available to the 
    widest possible market.  (b) Encryption speed 
    considerations should not be allowed to intrude 
    on questions of encryption quality, but once a 
    scheme had been decided upon, assembler routines 
    would be used to obtain the best possible speed.

    Is a noticeboard for anyone who wants to 
    advertise anything or who would like to know if 
    anyone has a certain item for sale.  It is just 
    like the `Reader`s Ads` column in many magazines.

^+  V1388   ILLUSIONS
    Everything is done using the mouse.  Apart from 
    entering text into file selectors for 
    loading/saving images, you do not have to touch 
    the keyboard at all.  At your disposal are 32 
    different colours - sixteen of these are set to 
    rotate continuously, while the other sixteen are 
    fixed and will draw pure, non-moving colour.  
    ILLUSIONS allows you to draw in both animated 
    colour, and non-animated colour - a bit like 
    super-imposure.  The results, after a bit of 
    experiment and practice, can be really 
    spectacular - stuff that will make your grandma's 
    false teeth drop out in amazement. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1389   KIDS NUMBER ONE
    The original Colour The Alphabet was one of the 
    first programmes I wrote for the Amiga.  I then 
    knew very little about the Amiga and even less 
    about AMOS.  One year on and....not much has 
    changed really!  This is a complete rewrite of 
    that original.  It retains the quintessential 
    core - colouring the alphabet - but now has 
    sampled voices, more options, a new game section 
    and stereophonic effects etc.  First choose to 
    colour letters, numbers or shapes.  The selection 
    is made by pointing and clicking on the word 
    itself. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1390   KIDS NUMBER TWO
    Contains BEAT SHEETS:  The existing music 
    trackers and the like are all far too tricky for 
    my children; all those meaningless numbers or 
    funny squiggly things!  So I wrote this to try 
    and persuade them to think in patterns of sound 
    rather than bashing away on the keyboard at 
    random.  MATHS MAZE:  The wicked witch has cast 
    the little princess into the dark dungeon beneath 
    the castle.  Is the princess afraid?  No.  She 
    knows that all she has to do is find the magic 
    crown and she will be free again.  Is the 
    princess worried? No.  She knows that you will 
    help her on her way.  SHAPE SORTER:  A simple 
    match the picture to the word game.  Use the left 
    and right arrow keys to steer the shape down the 
    right chute.  Get 20 right or 5 wrong to finish.

    to create 3D Stereograms.  What is a Stereogram?  
    A Stereogram is a two dimensional image that has 
    been encoded with a three dimensional picture.  
    Another term for this type of image is SIRDS.  
    SIRDS, however, uses only random dots for their 
    background.  The StereoScopic program allows you 
    to use any type of background, including random 
    dots.  Author Timothy Eckel.

^+  V1404   DEVICE-MASHER SYSTEM V2.03
    FMS is a part of DMS, which allows the user to 
    pack files and include those files to the DMS 
    file.  DMS and FMS, a 2-in-one file packing 
    utility.  FMS is file compressor for data and/or 
    executable not unlike files.  DMS shows that it 
    can compete with LhA in file packing, and 
    combining both diskimages and files in one single 
    archive, this makes it even more powerful.  FMS 
    will detect DMS images(tracks) and tell you if 
    found, and vice versa when unpacking tracks.  
    When packing whole directories, FMS is very 
    simple to use for this.  Specify directory for 
    packing, and the directory + sub directories will 
    be packed without having to do anything, but 
    specifying the directory.  ParCon software. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1405   VIRTUAL UTILITIES
    This disk contains five utilities containing 
    everything needed for any Amiga user to make 
    virtual memory from their harddrive. The Amiga is 
    fooled into thinking it has massive amounts of 
    RAM when really it only has a small amount mapped 
    to a file on the harddrive. Well worth getting. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1406   (AGA) VIDEO TRACKER
    This piece of software can be used to create 
    stunning demos, intros or vidules as they are 
    called by the author. The program takes certain 
    effects (IFF screens, animations and many more) 
    and assigns them to particular parts of the sound 
    module you choose. It can make effects happen 
    whenever certain samples are played, for example. 
    Very good. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1407   SONIC DRUM V2.0
    You can create your very own drum scores using 
    this fun program. Select from many percussion 
    instruments and you will have your score ready in 
    minutes. Very good. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1408   AMOSEYES PACKAGE V1.0
    A very good idea in document viewing. This 
    program allows the combination of text and 
    graphics all in one viewer. The Amoseyes viewer 
    will show graphics between the text around the 
    text and even behind the text. The document files 
    are created using the Amoseyes Editor. An 
    excellent idea for game authors and others too. 
    Very good. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1409   NO SAMPLER? UTILITIES 3
    There are three utilities included on this disk. 
    SuperSound v3 is an excellent sample editor which 
    can be used to cut and paste samples and to add 
    effects so that you can get the sound that you 
    want. The Real Time Effects Generator (RTEG) is 
    just like an effects box. The effects are used as 
    the sample is played but the sample can not be 
    resaved with the effect added onto it. However 
    the effect can be played and then resampled at a 
    later date. WonderSound is a utility for creating 
    instruments from scratch by creating the waveform 
    needed. All sorts of original sounds can be 
    designed. Very good. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1410   CAG V3.1
    Create Adventure Games is a utility that allows 
    the user to do just that. The games can be simple 
    text based adventures or they can incorporate the 
    use of graphics, music and sound effects as well. 
    The more effort you put into the programming of 
    the game the better it will be. Very good for 
    adventure gamers. 
------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1411   LECASM V1.0A
    This is an assembler package which includes, as 
    well as the assembler, an editor, linker, and a 
    program that shows the structure of a hunk in an 
    Amigados file. Also included is CacheClock which 
    displays the time, free memory and creates a 
    floppy disk cache. Good package.

    Another Assassins collection, this time dedicated 
    to video titlers. There are five included on this 
    compilation. Inscript is a video titler that 
    works much on the lines of a desk top publisher. 
    For example unlike many titler or art package, 
    text can be re edited and changed in size, shape 
    and style long after it has been typed in. Video 
    Manager is a simple database intended to replace 
    the common notepad left beside the video recorder.
     It will store details of all your video 
    cassettes, the length, the programmes recorded 
    and their length etc.. ATS is will scroll a large 
    IFF up the screen for use as video after titles. 
    JACOsub is a program that will play a timed 
    script for video titles. sMOVIE is a video titler 
    and text viewer that can smoothly scroll all 
    kinds of text up the screen. Very good.

^+  V1415   APPLE2000 EMULATOR
    Apple 2000 is the premier Apple ][ emulator for 
    the Amiga computer.  At its current level it 
    accurately emulates a 64K Apple ][+, including:  
    6502 CPU; ALL video modes (Text, LoRes, HiRes, 
    Mixed modes, etc); 16k RAM card (64k computer); 
    5 disk drive (via disk images); Two button 
    joystick; Keyboard; Sound.  The emulation also 
    runs in a completely system friendly manner, 
    multitasking properly with other programs.  The 
    two main goals were speed and accuracy.  This was 
    accomplished by hand coding the emulator in 100% 
    machine language, optimization via instruction 
    cycle analysis, and painstaking attention to 
    Apple hardware details.  Requires Apple ][ ROM 
    image & disk controller ROM image.  Binary only,

^+  V1439   AMIGADOS REFERENCE GUIDE V1.0
    Welcome to the AmigaDOS Guide version 1.  Let me 
    start by saying exactly why I created this 
    program and what it's intended use is.  A few 
    years ago I came across very small program called 
    DOS Helper which as the title suggests was a 
    small help guide to AmigaDOS.  It was a great 
    little program and I learnt quite alot from it.  
    The problem was that to my knowlege it was never 
    updated and so only covered 1.3 commands.  And 
    since there have never been another P.D AmigaDOS 
    guide I decided to produce my own thus AmigaDOS 
    Guide v1.0 was born. 
------------------------------------------------------

    to four players, bombing your way through walls 
    and avoiding enemies. Good. There are two cheats. 
    One for Gunship 2000 and one for Hired Guns. 
    These allow the saved game files to be edited to 
    give you more lives etc. JoyTest is a tool to 
    show the joystick and mouse siganls in binary 
    form. RawSecs is a disk program that can break 
    down the sectors for editing and hacking. Good. 
------------------------------------------------------

     When you click on something, a load of 
    information including illustrations and technical 
    diagrams pops up. Very easy to use. Lots of 
    information. Good educational tool. 
------------------------------------------------------
^*  V1443   HCE V1.0 (AB)
    C Compiler envirenment for the Amiga.  HCE first 
    started out as a stand alone text editor for 
    programmers which was capable of compiling C 
    source codes from within the editor.  This was 
    done by running a PD compiler such as the ZC 
    compiler from the editor and passing the source 
    code filename. But this had its down sides such 
    as all error messages would go to the CLI, you 
    had to save the source code before you could 
    compile it, the compiler did not check memory as 
    it compiled and would on occasions crash, not 
    very pleasant!.  Then I came across the HCC 
    compiler by Detlef Wuerkner from fish disk 508, 
    which came with source and could compile itself!. 
     I decided to modify the Compiler and the Editor 
    source codes so as to be able to combine the two 
    and make a single program, 'HCE'.  It started off 
    with many bugs but eliminated the bad memory 
    management and other side effects.  By Jason 
    Petty.

^+  V1446   APLUSPLUS V1.01 (ABC)
    The A++ Library is a library written in C++ that 
    consists of classes assigned to the task of 
    encapsulating the Amiga system software.  Its 
    aim is to provide a stable and effective method 
    of programming the Amiga.  That should include 
    Exec, Dos, Intuition, ARexx, ..just everything 
    that makes sense being encapsulated with a proper 
    C++ class interface.  The A++ Library collects 
    the hundreds of system functions, groups them 
    into classes that 'know' about the specialities 
    of each function and thus shields the programmer 
    from using them incorrectly.  The C++ programming 
    language provides the object oriented paradigm 
    that holds no limitations to evolution of 
    existing solutions.

    Basically, Pro-Gamble is a horse racing prediction system that works! 
    Having looked at other gambling programs on the Amiga, I couldn`t 
    find one that was both easy to use and accurate in it`s predictions.  
    With these two criteria in mind, I set about writing Pro-Gamble, 
    mainly for my own use.  As the program developed though, it`s power 
    became more obvious, and I decided to release it as a shareware 
    program.

    improve on that! Instructions, Load 'Kick141' and when the 
    hand-holding the disk appears, press:  F1:  Toggle CPU caches.  F2:  
    Toggle between PAL/NTSC.  ESC:  Hard reset (remove Kick141 from 
    memory!).  The disk on the screen can be 1 of 2 colors:  BLUE = CPU 
    caches DISABLED.  GREEN= CPU caches ENABLED.  If you only have a 
    68000 processor, then you will not be able to toggle CPU caches.  But 
    if you have a 68010+, then you CAN toggle the caches!  If your 
    machine has a 68010+, then the CPU caches will be re-enabled every 
    time you reboot.

^+  V1531   (AGA) SPECTRUM EMULATOR V1.35
    Well, maybe you have guessed that this program is a Sinclair ZX 
    Spectrum 48k emulator, with all those lovely attributes and only one 
    channel of 1 bit sound (sob...).  This is a very very eta version.  
    It is unfinished, but I have decided to release it with the aim that 
    the people test the emulator (and love it, or maybe hate it...) and 
    give me their opinion and ideas about it.  Actually this emulator is 
    mainly a hack, that access directly to the AGA hardware.  The final 
    version will be much more friendly (as much friendly as I can manage 
    to do it) with the operative system and with the hardware.  This 
    program needs WorkBench 3.0 (v39) or higher to run, the AGA chipset 
    and a 68020 CPU, or better.  In short, an Amiga 1200 or 4000.  It 
    needs the powerpacker.library too, to load the compressed Spectrum 
    programs, in LIBS:  or in the same directory of the executable. Is 
    VERY convenient that you have 32 bits FAST memory.  With FAST memory 
    the speed, and the sound, will be A LOT better.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^^  V1552   MAGIC USER INTERFACE V2.2
    MUI is an object oriented system to create and maintain graphical 
    user interfaces.  From a programmers point of view, using MUI saves a 
    lot of time and makes life much easier.  Thinking about complicated 
    terms like window resizing or font sensitivity is simply not 
    neccesary.  On the other hand, users of MUI based applications have 
    the ability to customize nearly every pixel of a programs interface 
    according to their personal taste. This distribution is interesting 
    for both, users and programmers.  Please have a look at the supplied 
    demo programs and at the documentation to see what MUI has to offer.  
    MUI is an SASG (Standardized Amiga Shareware Group) product. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1553   CASSINI V3.2
    a menu driven program which calculates information about the Sun, 
    Moon, Planets and constellations.  The program was written and

    Astronomy With A Personal Computer.  Please note that all calculated 
    times are Universal Time (which is the same as Greenwich Mean Time 
    [GMT]) and are not corrected for any daylight saving time that may be 
    in effect in your area.

^^  V1555   IMAGINE BUDDY SYSTEM (B)
    Disk 2 of 2 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^+  V1556   IMAGESTUDIO V1.0.1
    is written for the casual graphics user who wishes to convert or 
    manipulate various graphics formats on a modest Amiga system.  There 
    are several commercial offerings available, however the casual user 
    is paying a lot of money for many facilities and options they would 
    probably never use. Bitmap graphics, by their nature, usually require 
    large amounts of RAM.  One of the main objectives of ImageStudio was 
    to reduce this burden by utilising virtual memory - most users have 
    more spare hard disk space than spare RAM. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^*  V1557   IMAGE PROCESSING 3
    GIFKIT v1.0, Allows you to do visual crops, resizing, flips and 
    rotates of GIF images.  PICCON v2.50 Is a program to aid developers

    programs.  SuperView v3.3 A localized Graphics Viewer for the 
    superview.library, with ARexx-Support, GUI, Online-Help and many 
    other features.  Converting of graphics and Screen-Grabbing is also 
    possible.  SuperView-Lib v8.1.  svoJPEG v2.3 [Miscellaneous] JPEG 
    svobject for superview.library V6+. Allows switching between 8 and 24 
    bit output via control pads, writes JPEG (24 Bit) from 1-8 and 24 bit,
     worked fine with all tested 24 bit JPEGs.  ZGIF_DRVR v1.0 [Image 
    Viewing] A driver interface for the ZGIF GIF image viewer.  Can also 
    be used with FASTGIF, VIEWTEK, etc.  Allows you to view up to 400 
    GIFs' with the click of a mouse button.  Ideal for previewing the 
    hundreds of GIFs' that come on a CDROM.  Binary only

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^*  V1559   TOASTER TEXTURES VOLUME 1
    By Thomas Dawson.  Contains Four Reflection Maps - These images 
    compliment the FractalReflections image the comes with LightWave.  
    Just like using different font styles to set the tone for a document, 
    using different reflection maps helps to set the mood and character 
    of your animations.  All four of these reflection maps are seamless.  
    TWO BUMP MAPS - These were done with a science fiction theme. They 
    help you to create both an alien and the planet it came from.  The 
    trick is to also use them as a diffuse map as well as a bump map.  
    Apply the OrganicArmor texture to a humanoid model to get one wild 
    looking alien. Apply the EnemyPlanet texture to a sphere to create my 
    version of the planet Metaluna from the movie This Island Earth.  
    Both of these images are seamless.  NINETEEN SURFACES:  twelve of 
    these are for the included reflection maps, two for the included bump 
    maps and five other procedural based surfaces are included. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

^+  V1562   SIEGFRIED COPY
    A new diskcopy program. This tool appears to have all the regular 
    options and facilities that most copiers have these days. However I 
    can't be too sure on that note because the entire documentation and 
    the program itself is for those who are fluent in German.
