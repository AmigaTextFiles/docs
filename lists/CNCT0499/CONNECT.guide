Welcome to the Second Issue of CONNECTIONS!!!  CONNECTIONS is a *NEW*
Monthly UK BBS Scene Magazine containing a comprehensive UK BBS Directory.

Many SysOps have tried their hands at generating up-to-date BBS Lists, but
most have found them too difficult to maintain and have abandoned updating
them, with the exception of the odd few, like Turbo D at @{"Alpha Zone BBS" Link AlphaZoneBBS}
who has for the last 5 months supplied a list of BBS Numbers to the AMINET.

However, most BBS Lists contain BBS Numbers of BBSes that have long since
left the scene, and of all the Lists we have encountered, there hasn't
been one that has been accurately up-to-date.

At the time of going to press, ALL the BBSes listed in CONNECTIONS have
been 100% verified as being online.  We have spent the last 3 months
ringing BBS Numbers to find out which BBSes are still online, and to find
out those that have left the scene.  We have still a lot of work to do,
but I'm sure you can appreciate the cost of dialling every BBS Number we
have found in the afore mentioned BBS Lists, and that is why we need YOUR
help in providing us with information of any BBSes you know that are still
online, that are not listed in this issue of CONNECTIONS.

Furthermore, we need YOUR help in keeping CONNECTIONS up-to-date with BBS
Closures, New Numbers, Relaunches, Renames etc.  For more details on how
to contact us, access @{"Submissions" Link Submissions}.

The BBS Scene is in bad need of positive publicity...and we at CONNECTIONS
strongly believe that BBS Advertising is a damn good start.  CONNECTIONS
aims to provide the AMIGA Community with a central resource of information
regarding the current status of the UK BBS Scene, with the added bonus of a
comprehensive UK BBS Directory every month.

We hope that CONNECTIONS will be received favourably by SysOps and BBS
Callers alike, and Correspondence is welcomed from ALL who read this
issue.  We guarantee that 100% of the Correspondence we receive will be
read and replied to accordingly, and may even be included in the next issue
of CONNECTIONS.

Plans to take CONNECTIONS' coverage beyond the United Kingdom are already
under consideration.  Work on GLOBAL CONNECTIONS has already started, but
we foresee a problem that really needs to be addressed before we continue
any further with the project.  Basically, does the UK BBS Scene really want
an International BBS Directory?  If the answer to this questions is "Yes",
then how do we market it?  Do we release it seperately, to give YOU the
choice whether you want to Download it or not, or do we include it within
CONNECTIONS, bearing in mind the Archive Size will probably double?

Please help us to make this decision, get in touch with us at CONNECTIONS,
and let us know what YOU want.  If we get no response from YOU, as readers
of CONNECTIONS, then the GLOBAL CONNECTIONS project will be scrapped.

We would like to point out that we do take the BBS Scene seriously, and
genuinely want to help revive what can only be described as a dying
industry, but SysOps out there must wake up to the fact that if they don't
advertise their humble abodes, then who is going to know that they are
there?  In researching for CONNECTIONS, we have come across many a SysOp,
who despite complaining of reduced Calls and lack of Users, have made no
attempt to do something about it, depite CONNECTIONS offering them a free
chance to advertise worldwide via the AMINET!!!

AMIGA FORMAT magazine recently started a column for BBS Numbers in their
Readers Adverts section, and those that have advertised, including
ourselves, have found that advertising DOES work, and that there ARE
members of the AMIGA Community who want to call BBSes, but never knew
where to get in contact with them!  Therefore in respect of all you SysOps
that think that advertising is a waste of time...we rest our case...!!!

The WEDNESDAY 17TH FEBRUARY launch of CONNECTIONS, did not go as smoothly
as we had anticipated, due to a problem with the original CONNECTIONS
Archive.  After releasing CONNECTIONS on the AMINET, we discovered that we
had forgotten to include the CONNECT.guide Icon, which basically launches
CONNECTIONS.  Therefore CONNECTIONS had to be re-released on the AMINET
with the CONNECT.guide Icon included, and the updated Archive finally
appeared on the AMINET, on WEDNESDAY 24TH FEBRUARY.  Sorry about that!!!

The fighting spirit of the humble BBS is still alive and kicking out there,
still offering a service to their loyal Callers who Log-On to them on a
regular basis to Download whatever Files take their fancy, and satisfying
the hardy SysOps to keep there BBSes open for a little longer, despite the
hammering they take from the Internet.

When we first researched for CONNECTIONS to find out just how many BBSes
were still up and running, we were pleasantly suprised by the number we
found were still online, and those 124 BBSes we found, were entered into
the First Issue of CONNECTIONS.  That 124 BBSes has now grown to 180 BBSes
for the Second Issue of CONNECTIONS, just proving that the UK BBS Scene is
far from dead, as was first thought. 

From our point of view, CONNECTIONS has really made a difference to the
number of Calls and New Users at our respective BBSes, and many of our New
Users had never been on a BBS before in their lives, the Internet, yes, but
never a BBS, as they thought that BBSes were extinct.  Feedback from other
SysOps who advertised in CONNECTIONS suggests that they have experienced the
same result, which proves a point, that SysOps should not just sit back and
accept the number of Users in their User-Base, but should advertise their
BBSes as much as possible, CONNECTIONS giving them that very chance.

The Internet has done much damage to the UK BBS Scene, especially when Free
ISPs were launched, but that damage is not irrepairable, as we have proven,
and ironically CONNECTIONS has used the Internet to get to it's prospective
audience, to get Internet Users back to the UK BBS Scene, and it appears to
have worked, and worked well.

CONNECTIONS has been well received from SysOps and BBS Users alike, and the
Correspondence we have received has been tremendous.  We honestly didn't
believe that CONNECTIONS would be so popular, and never expected CONNECTIONS
to achieve the results that we have witnessed after only its First Issue!!!

We would like to thank ALL of YOU that have contacted CONNECTIONS since its
launch, without your input and feedback, CONNECTIONS could not have grown
to what it has become for its Second Issue.  We would particularly like to
thank Warpig (SysOp Of @{"Nitemare BBS" Link NitemareBBS}) for his continual support and his
enthusiasm in helping CONNECTIONS.  At one point, we were receiving E-Mail
on a daily basis from him, and it's thanks to him, that we have so many more
BBS Entries in this Second Issue of CONNECTIONS.

Please keep the Correspondence coming, we would especially like to hear from
SysOps who have advertised their BBSes in CONNECTIONS, and have benefitted
as a result.  Also, if any of you have any ideas on how we can improve the
content of CONNECTIONS, or if you have anything at all to contribute to
CONNECTIONS, then please get in touch, even if you only have a sentence or
two to say, ALL Correspondence will be read and replied to, and may even
get included in the Next Issue of CONNECTIONS!

See you Next Issue...

I Downloaded CONNECTIONS, when it first came out.  I already had a BBS List
from the Internet, compiled by Turbo D at @{"Alpha Zone BBS" Link AlphaZoneBBS}, but many of the
BBSes had either perished, or had moved away.  Now I'm sure that I am not
the only one who has woken some poor bugger in the early hours of the
morning, ringing an advertised BBS.  "HELLO?" says the person at the other
end in a "DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE BLOODY TIME IS?" voice. "CLICK" says the
Modem, "NO CARRIER" says NComm, ******* you say.  To me, this is what
CONNECTIONS is all about, not only keeping us up-to-date with the BBSes,
but also letting some people have a good night's kip!!!

I first got into the BBS Scene about 3 months ago, and to be honest, before,
I've got to admit, I thought to myself: "Yeah...they're right...The AMIGA IS
DEAD!", but not anymore.  I used to think that my 275 MB Hard-Drive was more
than enough, but I've nearly filled it with Files I've Downloaded from all
the BBSes I've visited.  All this, and not to mention, the amount of friends
I have made over the last 3 months, and there's always been someone there if
I had any problems with my AMIGA!

The main ingredient of a really good BBS is the Callers.  Since CONNECTIONS
started, I have noticed an increase in Callers in ALL of the BBSes I visit,
and that can only be good news.  More Callers means more Uploads, and more
Uploads means more Files, and more Files means more Callers, and the more
Callers a BBS gets, means more encouragement for the SysOp to keep the BBS
running, and improve it!  Easy to understand why Callers are THE BBS itself!
 
In my mind, CONNECTIONS has really made a difference, coming from Scotland,
I thought there weren't any local BBSes that I could visit.  CONNECTIONS
made me aware that there WERE BBSes in the local area, waiting for my call,
and it's thanks to CONNECTIONS, that I am now a member of 2 Scottish BBSes.
Not all of us can afford large Phone Bills, (what I'm saying...none of us
can!!!), so calling your local BBSes makes sense.

CONNECTIONS magazine has kept the AMIGA life-support machine running, when
so many have tried to sneak in and switch it off.  Who knows, one day, with
the help of CONNECTIONS, we may see the UK BBS Scene up and about again,
good as new!  In the meantime, it is up to ALL of us, to make sure the
AMIGA life-support machine's plug is never pulled out!!!

Thanks for reading...

"Downloaded your first monthly CONNECTIONS from the AMINET.  It's very
useful and well produced.  My only criticism is the CONNECTIONS Logo, where
you swap Upper & Lower Case (CoNnEcTiOnS).  It's very hard to read, and it
makes my hate hairs rise."

John Marchant (SysOp Of @{"Moonlight BBS" Link MoonlightBBS})

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

The reason why we opted for the Upper & Lower Case CONNECTIONS Logo, is we
wanted CONNECTIONS to have a unique Logo that we could easily insert into
the Magazine as Text, because by using AmigaGuide to create CONNECTIONS,
Graphics were really out of the question!  We decided to use Upper & Lower
Case Lettering as a homage to the original Amiga BBS Scene, which had many
Custom Font Styles, the CONNECTIONS Logo being just one of them.

"Could you remove the forced TOPAZ/8 Font please in CONNECTIONS?  It's too
big and ugly on my AMIGA A1200 and too small to see on my AMIGA A2000."

Neil Williams (SysOp Of The Killing Ground BBS)

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

The reason why we opted for the forced TOPAZ/8 Font in CONNECTIONS, was to
ensure that CONNECTIONS would look the same on ALL AMIGA Systems, as some
AmigaGuide based Magazines DON'T force a Font, and in our opinion it can
make them look very unprofessional if your System Default Font is not the
same as the one that the Magazine Author had intended you to use!

To cure the problem, we suggest that you load CONNECTIONS in a Text-Editor,
and either remove the FONT Command at Line 5, or alter the FONT Command to
your particular taste.  Sorry for any inconvienience this may have caused
you, but we're sure you can understand our logic behind our decision to
force a Font in CONNECTIONS.

       | The CIRCLE BBS online times and calling information:       |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       | Monday -> Thursday : 00:00 -> 07:00 hrs  : NORMAL DIALLING |
       |                                                            |
       | ALL OTHER TIMES    : The BBS uses RINGBACK (see below).    |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+

       (Normal dialling means:- just call as you would any other BBS)

 USING THE CIRCLE BBS RINGBACK:

 Call the BBS and let the phone ring once, immediately HANG UP.
 Wait 15-20 seconds for the BBS to be loaded.
 Call the BBS again and you'll be connected.
 Please don't just call it as normal - I'll think it's a voice call
 and you'll hear "Hello?" through your modem speaker! ;)

 *FILES*

 14 Online CDs, basically the last 14 Aminets.  Frost Free also regularly
 downloads the latest Aminet files direct to disk for BBS download and Freq.

 *FREQS*

 All files on the BBS and CDs are available for Freq.

 Freq FILES for the Disk based Filelist or AMINET<Number> for the CD File
 Lists, e.g AMINET23

 *MAIL*

 Fidonet - Amiganet - Landnet - Vibeznet - Studentnet - Fluffynet.

 Any echo, no matter how obscure is available.  Mail can be read online or
 via Fido Software.

 Point applications are welcome from old and new.

 E-Mail addresses are available to BBS Users and Fido Users.

 Mail is available via Email to Nodes and Points.

 There is also an IRC channel #FrostFree where points, users and whoever
 else meet up on a nightly basis.  It gets a bit wacky so be warned :)

 *GAMES*

 If you really are a complete anorak, you can play ANSI BBS games.  Enjoy
 yourself and make BT richer while the rest of us go to Dixons and buy a
 PlayStation for 99 quid.

 *EPILOGUE*

 Frost Free is a BBS, it has Files on CD, it has important files not on CD,
 it also carries mail and the SysOp will look after you.

 Thank you.
