OwnDevUnit      A package that provides an extended locking mechanism for a
                device/unit pair that makes using programs like getty much
                easier.  Getty is a program that sits on the serial port
                waiting for calls to come in.  By using OwnDevUnit.library, a
                program can request that getty temporarily release the serial
                port.  An update to version 2.0 on disk 577.
                Version 2.1.  Includes source.

                for use in P-Reader illustrated texts.  
                Version 2.1, freeware, binary only.
                Author:  Chas A Wyndham

P-Compress      A compression program that produces smaller files faster than
                any other current general-purpose cruncher, using LZH com-
                pression algorithms.  Can handle single files, whole drawers,
                disks, or selected files or types of file within drawers and
                disks.  Includes compression and decompression object files
                which can be linked to your own programs to allow them to
                access and output data in LZH format.  An update to version 
                2.1 on disk 595, with substantial enhancements.

P-FixLib        A new P-Suite utility that diverts calls to DOS library so
                that P-Compressed files are decompressed before being opened
                or executed.  Any type of file, inluding icons, executables,
                libraries, fonts, texts, etc. may be compressed.  Effectively
                doubles the capacity of your disks.  
                Version 1.2, freeware, binary only.

                subset of 4105) emulator, currently in use at SLAC
                (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center).  Although the VT100
                part was originally based on Dave Wecker et al.'s VT100,
                many enhancements were made.  Features include use of ARP,
                an ARexx port, XMODEM 1K/CRC and Kermit protocols, support
                for additional serial ports, external file transfer protocols
                (XPR), a "chat" mode, and scrollback/review/history buffer.
                It comes in two versions, one with Tektronix emulation, and
                one without.  The Tektronix emulation allows saving IFF files,
                PostScript files, and printing bitmaps to the printer.  This

                It consists of six manuals, with more than 40 chapters, 175
                fully executable examples complete with source code, and sev-
                eral utilities and other goodies.  The manuals describe how
                to open and work with Screens, Windows, Graphics, Gadgets,
                Requesters, Alerts, Menus, IDCMP, Sprites, VSprites, AmigaDOS,

                use your C Compiler and give you important information about
                how the Amiga works and how your programs should be designed.
                When unpacked, the manuals and examples nearly fill up twelve
                standard Amiga floppies.  This is an update to version 2.0

                able on the Amiga 500 and 2000, so provided you have one of
                these computers and a monitor capable of receiving its input
                through composite video, no modifications are required to the
                Amiga.  The PBMPlus library of graphics manipulation routines

This is disk 698 of the freely distributable AMIGA software library.

SCRAM500        The first of a series of Public Domain "KitWare" hardware
                projects for the Amiga.  On this disk you will find the design
                for an 8Meg RAM and SCSI controller for the Amiga 500 (SCsi
                RAM for the 500 = SCRAM 500).  You will also find an order
                form to obtain PCB, chips and whatever you need to build one.
                The SCRAM 500 is easy to build, cheap and should be useful to
                a lot of people.  Included in this distribution is complete
                documentation on how to assemble a SCRAM 500, notes for Amiga
                1000 owners, a description of the custom chips, design notes,
                troubleshooting guide, user's manual, bill of materials, 12
                HPGL plot files for schematics and PCB layout, hard drive
                partitioning software, a mountable device driver, a ROMable
                driver, and more!

EZAsm           Combines 68000 assembly language with parts of C.  Produces
                highly optimized code.  Uses C-like function calls (supports
                all 2.04 functions), braces, "else", ".fd" support, and much
                more.  Comes bundled with A68k and Blink, for a complete
                programming environment.  This is  an update to version 1.6 
                on disk 592.  Includes example source and executable files.  
                Version 1.7.  Binary only.

IFFConvert      A program to convert the different compression methods of IFF
                ILBM files.  It supports the normal compression, a new com-
                pression method that compresses column by column instead of
                row by row, and uncompressed files.
                Version 1.11, includes source.

MungWall        Munges memory and watches for illegal FreeMem's.  Especially
                useful in combination with Enforcer.  Output can go to either
                the serial or parallel port.  Includes a new MungList program
                that examines used memory areas for MungWall tag info, and
                outputs a list of who owns the various pieces of allocated
                memory, their sizes, etc.  Can even identify the owner of the
                memory by task name.  An update to version 37.51 on disk 659.
                Version 37.52.  Binary only.

ReOrg           ReOrg is a fast disk optimizer that can be used for floppy
                disks and hard disks.  Supports new Kickstart 2.04 features
                including hard and soft links and High-Density drives. In-
                cludes program versions in English and German for use with
                Kickstart 2.04 only.  An update to version 2.1 on disk 678.
                Version 2.3.  Shareware, binary only.

Shrink          A new archiver that uses dynamic arithmetic encoding with a
                dictionary size from 1-64Kb.  Slower than other archivers, but
                seems to get better compression ratios.  Another interesting
                feature is that it uses a new IFF format for it's archive files.
                Version 1.1, binary only.

Sizer           Reports the size of selected disk objects (including subdir-
                ectories).  It reports the number of bytes in all plain files
                and the number of blocks occupied by files and directories.
                It is intended for the Workbench user who wants to know if
                there is room to drag-copy one or more icons.  Includes source
                and binary.
