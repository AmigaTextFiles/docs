<PRE>Get a FREE Action Replay MKIII !!

AAhhhh WhdLoad & JST allow me to re-play my old games... when I played with
my old Action Replay MKIII to get some infinite lifes, grab some pics and
sounds of the games... and I cracked for the 1st time a game with it:
Hired Guns and his fuc** protection...

You know what? WhdLoad AND JST are allowing to use a FREE action replay
proggy !!! you don't need anything else that the progs!...

This proggy is HRTmon, the last versions are FREE, you can only find
the last 2.25 version on the web homepage at:
http://dumbo.cryogen.ch/hrtmon/index.html

HRTmon runs exactly as the old MKIII, but with more stuff! (access to your
HD!). But as it is pure software, some games don't allow to use it...
BUT WhdLoad and JST are supporting HRTmon so any games installed with JST
or WhdLoad will allow you to use the ActionReplay !

You need to tell them that you want to...
-In JST, put the tooltype FREEZEKEY=$xx in every games icons or NEW in JST1.5,
 set the AmigaDos environnement variable. By using TEST in tooltype, you'll be
 able to see if HRTmon is detected in memory by JST.
-In WhdLoad, this is stranger, you need to get the Developper WhdLoad archive,
 to take the WhdLoad.prefs file and save it into your S:. Then, you need to
 edit it and turn on the FREEZEKEY=$xx command to use it in every Whd games.

NOTE: $xx must, of course, be changed by your wanted freezekey...
