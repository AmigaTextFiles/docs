<PRE>About the Amiga Game Patches Guide

The AGPG can be read online at:
http://surf.to/ninjaw

This guide is a reference about all the patches availables for amiga games,
it (will) references all WhdLoad games, JST games, DaCoolPatcher, officials,
and even illegal patched games!

Today, game patches are a mode on amiga! each week, there are a lot of news!
Here is the solution!

What for? Hd patches are upgradable! so check now the version of your WHDload
or JST/JOTD installed games...
You still have uninstalled games??? impossible!

This guide is in two archives!!
agpg.lha        The guide
agpg_txt.lha    All Patches readme!
