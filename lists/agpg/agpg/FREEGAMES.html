a webpage filled with rotated patched games

A webpage gives ALL DIGITAL ILLUSIONS GAMES legally but in .ADF

A webpage gives ALL THE GAME FROM THALION in .ADF

 <a href="WEBLINKS.html">Factor5</a> are free giving their game on the web, directly in UAE ADF format,
this is a file disk format similar to an non-compressed DMS, there's a lot
of tools to use these as Dimage, Transadf, adf2fms, ITD(from the Whd dev pack)
... 
but 4/6 ADFs are gived in a incredible disk size...
...I played with them directly on Winuae... but you can't do anything else
BUT I talked & talked to the Turrican2 JST author... he first gave to me
a compiled version of his readdisk prog used in his installer, but to be
used on a UAE (well aparently for good programmers, it could be possible
by yourself on all his patches... but he only made one!)
And this worked! (well I needed to download the Tur2hd1.1 ...)
After this, it's another work to use the diskfile in whdload! this is
explained in the readme...
But wait the 1.2 ... he promises me that the installer will accept the famous
ADF file....
