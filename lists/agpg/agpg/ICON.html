<PRE>ABOUT ROMICONS

RomIcons are standar icons using a defined 16 colours palette.
The advantages are that it works on ECS, and you can design HUGE icons.
And the colours are good! RomIcons can be found on aminet in a MWB icon
collection!?! in fact, only one time they imagined the 16 cols palette
(originally for MWB). Often, there is RomIcons inside WhdLoad patches.

I finally designed my workbench to be able to show Rom/Mwb/New icons,
and it was hard!  <a href="SCREENSHOT22EREADME2FMAIN.html">Read this!</a>
I you want to see the result on my WB,  <a href="VISAGE_SCREENSHOT22EIFF.html">Look at it!</a> (require Visage)

ABOUT GLOWICONS AND NEWICONS

The icons of this guide are designed in GlowIcon and have a poor MagicWB
translation for the primates.

 <a href="VISAGE_SCREENSHOT2EIFF.html">Wanna have a look at my Workbench Screen ???</a> You need the incredible VISAGE viewer

NewIcons is a incredible patch to render your Workbench icons
really great. BUT some idiots didn't like the NewIcons "Icons",
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?? Don't be stupid: NewIcons is first a wonderful
PATCH and not an Icon collection

Anyway, for those that don't like the NewIcons collection, here is
GlowIcon, just a NewIcon collection in 64 colours really
beautiful.

And forget about MagicWorkbench, it's really too horrible.

PRICES:
NewIcons:       FREE
GlowIcons:      FREE
MagicWorkbench: NOT FREE
