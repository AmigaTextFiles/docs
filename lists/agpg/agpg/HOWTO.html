<PRE>How to update the Jst/Whdload patches?

You know that you can update the version number of a game?
You know that you can update the version number of JST or WHDload?
You can too update the version number of a JST or WHDload patched game!
What for? for new features, or better compatibility like:
hiscore saving, snapshots, protection removing, speed adjust,
sprite correction, new versions supported, trainer....

BEWARE: This is only mostly working with 'standard' JST/WHD patches
        (...using 900Ko diskfiles...)

The JST/WHDload packs have installers but no updaters!!
So you must re-read again every disks? nooo! update: Unarchive the
pack, Open a file manager as Directory Opus 4 or Diskmaster2 and then:

-On JST: look what you get in the pack, delete the install and his icon
         and copy the main file and his icon, and the readme file without
         his icon, and that's it! patch is updated. Be careful to not
         erasing a cool NIcon that you can have in NIcon packages I've done

-On WHDload: look what you get in the pack, delete the install and his icon,
             delete the imager, and copy the slave file and the main icon,
             and the TXT file without his icon.

How to transform a JST installed game into a WHDload one!:
this could be interresting for Rodland, for an example!
1-Erase all files into the main drawer exept *.d1, *.d2 ... or it could be
  *.Disk1, *.Disk2 ...
2-Rename this diskfiles as Disk.1, Disk.2 ....
3-Copy the Whdload files described previously!
4-done

Example transforming RodlandJST into RodlandWHD:
