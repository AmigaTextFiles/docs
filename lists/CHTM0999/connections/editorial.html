                             <u>A Word From Dunkie</u>

Welcome to Issue Seven of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  Following on from last month's 9 BBS
Closures, it is with much regret that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has to announce another 6
BBS Closures this month.  However, all is not doom and gloom, as <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">
welcomes 3 *NEW* BBSes to the UK BBS Scene this month (Comfortably Numb BBS,
<a href="eroticstudiosbbs.html">Erotic Studios BBS</a>, Innocent BBS) and 1 BBS Relaunch (<a href="totaloblivionbbs.html">Total Oblivion BBS</a>).
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has also been reliably informed that 2 of the 6 BBS Closures
this month, are only temporary, until new Phone-Lines are established.

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> popularity appears to be on the increase, with many <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">
Readers calling <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a> this month, to ask when the Next Issue was going
to be released, some of them wanting the Next Issue only a week after the
Last Issue was released!!!  But, this good news is overshadowed by the fact
that hardly anyone has bothered to submit any Articles or any Correspondence
to <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> this month.  You would have thought that with <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">
being so popular as it is at the moment, that there would be Articles and
Correspondence from <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers coming out of my ears.  Sadly, this
is not the case, and I've seriously considered closing <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> down this
month as a result of this!!!  I mean how can you have a Magazine without any
Content?  How can I know as Editor of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> just what <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is
doing for you, SysOps and Readers, unless you tell me?

The frustrating thing for me this month, has been that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has been
discussed and reviewed by SysOps and Readers quite widely on the major Mail
Networks, they being FluffyNet and PowerNet, yet none of these SysOps and
Readers have bothered to tell <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> what they think of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">!!!
It would be nice if SysOps and Readers could let <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> know of any
views they might have, as all Feedback is welcomed, and usually ends up in
the Next Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  Therefore the more the Feedback...the more
the Magazine content, which in turn gives YOU the SysOps and Readers more
to read every month!!!

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> would like to specially thank Pipa (SysOp Of <a href="darkdomainbbs.html">Dark Domain BBS</a>)
and S.N.S (SysOp Of <a href="skullmonkeybbs.html">Skull Monkey BBS</a>) for their continuing support on the
PowerNet Mail Network, and for distributing <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> over the Internet
IRC Channels.  Not only that, Pipa (SysOp Of <a href="darkdomainbbs.html">Dark Domain BBS</a>) helped avert
the closure of <a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a> this month, after persons unknown attempted to
sabotage <a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a>.  <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> asked Pipa (SysOp Of <a href="darkdomainbbs.html">Dark Domain BBS</a>)
for her help with the matter, in trying to undo the damage inflicted to
<a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a>, and she really did help out with flying colours...thankyou!!!

On the other hand, <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> would like to apologise to Dave Clarke and
Paul Green, for failing to include their <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site Addresses in
the Last Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">!!!  Sorry guys...it totally slipped my mind,
but I can assure you your <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site Addresses are now located
in this Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> and will be in future Issues too!!!

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is always looking for ways in which to improve the content of
the Magazine, and this Issue sees the start of a Readers Adverts Column!!!
If you wish to advertise, either For Sale Items, Wanted Items, Contacts, 
Services etc, then just send your Adverts to the usual <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> E-Mail
Address.  If you don't have E-Mail access, then you can send your Adverts
directly to <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a> or <a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a>.  When submitting your Advert, which
incidentally will appear for 3 Issues, why not let <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> know at the
same time what you think of the Magazine, or what you'd like to see in
future Issues of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">!!!  

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is only as good as the Readership it gets, and for those that
read <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> and enjoy it, I'd like to say a big thankyou for making
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> the Number One UK BBS Scene Magazine every month.  Even Chris
Seward (Editor Of Amiga Information Online) reads <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> and has made
the offer of hosting a <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site alongside his own publication's
Web-Site!!!  Other exciting developments are being discussed with various
parties concerning <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, so as long as you SysOps and Readers are
reading <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> and enjoying the Magazine, the better <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is
going to become!!!

                              <u>A Word From Pete</u>

Well here am I, the Co-Editor of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, doing the most unforgivable
sin of nearly closing down <a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a> at the end of August, all due to a
bit of skull-duggery by persons unknown against <a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a>.  But, thanks
to Dunkie (SysOp Of <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a>) and Pipa (SysOp Of <a href="darkdomainbbs.html">Dark Domain BBS</a>), the
situation was resolved and they stopped me from making the big mistake of
closing <a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a>, in a month that has seen another 6 BBSes close down,
for one reason or another, which is another sad blow for the UK BBS Scene.

And now back to our monthly gripe regarding Articles, Feedback, BBS Adverts
etc!!!  Not again I hear you say, but if <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is going to continue in
it's present format, then we do need Feedback from SysOps, to let us know if
the Magazine is helping their BBSes.  We WANT to know, we NEED to know!!!
We also want Articles from SysOps giving their views on the UK BBS Scene, it
doesn't take ages to type out a few paragraphs, so come on guys we don't
want <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> to become just another BBS Listing, we want something that 
makes interesting reading.  The Magazine's future depends on YOU!!!

And for those SysOps who have not yet sent in an Advert for their BBSes,
then please send one into <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, it could make all the difference to
your BBS and to the UK BBS Scene!!!

See you Next Issue...

Pete Laird (SysOp Of <a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a>)
