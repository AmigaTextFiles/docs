     <u>Make More Use Of CoNnEcTiOnS - By Scatman (SysOp Of The Forum BBS)</u>

I'd like to say again, to all you SysOps out there, that you really should
make more use of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  Never before have we had the opportunity like
this, where 2 guys are willing to put in a little effort to let us advertise
our BBSes.  I now have 90 Users, and just had my 1000th Caller, and I must
say that this is all due to <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> and AMIGA FORMAT.

I recently got a BBS Number (Purple Motion BBS in Edinburgh) from the last
Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, this guy didn't even know about any other BBSes in
Scotland...so I sent him on his way to Dunkie at <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a> to pick up the
PC Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">!!!  Anyway this still goes to show that it is up
to US, the SysOps, to get our arses into gear and make FULL use of this
great service that we now have.

Thankyou Dunkie &amp; Pete, as without <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> and your efforts, the UK BBS
Scene as we know it would probably just have stayed as stagnent as ever :(

Here's to the future!!!
