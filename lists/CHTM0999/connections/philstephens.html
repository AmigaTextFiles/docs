                         AMIGA SUPPORT ASSOCIATION

                                <u>Introduction</u>

I would like to welcome you to the new AMIGA Support Association.  The
Association offers help and advice or just a friendly chat.  The main people
that will be organising the Association to start with are:-

Phil Stephens - Founder &amp; Organiser (<a href="mailto:snood@ukonline.co.uk">snood@ukonline.co.uk</a>)
  Mike O'Hara - Mailing List &amp; IRC Moderator
    Mike Legg - General Support

I hope more people will participate and help out as things progress as I
will hopefully be expanding on this idea as things move on.

                                <u>Mailing List</u>

The most favourite place for people to chat would be our Mailing List which
has been set up for you, all you need to do is send an E-Mail to:-

<a href="mailto:amiga_sa-subscribe@egroups.com">amiga_sa-subscribe@egroups.com</a>

This will allow you to post and read messages to other Classic AMIGA owners
from all over the world.  If there's something you want to know about, just
ask and I'm sure someone will be able to help.  The Mailing List has already
got off to a great start, with new members joining each day.  The Mailing
List is free and so is the advice given.  We are always here to help and
chat.

                         <u>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</u>

If you are one of those people that would like to meet online to chat with
other Classic AMIGA owners, we have made available an IRC channel on Arcnet
called #ASA.  Please feel free to drop in for a chat.  There is usually
someone attending most weekends and we hope that people will meet up and
have an enjoyable chat.

     Arcnet - Port 6667
IRC Channel - #ASA

                             <u>Meetings &amp; Events</u>

A venue for regular meetings will hopefully be setup shortly and will be in
the Southampton area.  So if you're local, please pledge your support as this
will only go ahead if we have enough people to warrant it.  We will only be
looking to cover our costs for this and you will only be charged a minimal
amount for an entrance fee.  Hopefully this will encourage more people to
join, and create a larger User-Base which will benefit everyone.

For further information, contact Phil Stephens on (023)-8048-9701 or E-Mail
<a href="mailto:snood@ukonline.co.uk">snood@ukonline.co.uk</a>.  Please note that we are unable to return calls.
