   <u>CoNnEcTiOnS' Helping Hand - By Ronnie Murphy (SysOp Of Kerry-Oot BBS)</u>

            IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT PEOPLE DO SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!
     IT'S NOT OFTEN PEOPLE GIVE UP THEIR FREE TIME TO HELP OUT OTHERS!
               AND...IT'S NOT OFTEN I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING!!!

Yes, the <a href="kerryootbbs.html">Kerry-Oot BBS</a> is now online and it's all thanks to <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.
No-one takes on the role of SysOp without having first had part of his
brain removed - the part that deals with all rational thought, then having
his Computer ripped from his grasp by the many Callers who ring night and
day - sometimes at an unearthly hour!!!  Yet I decided I wanted to be a
SysOp, simply because I wanted to give something back to the UK BBS Scene -
the UK BBS Scene which has kept the AMIGA alive!!!

I sometimes work Night-Shift, and when I come home, I head straight for bed.
This is not the case with Dunkie, Creator of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Magazine and SysOp
of <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a>.  To cut a long story short, Dunkie created the <a href="kerryootbbs.html">Kerry-Oot BBS</a>
for me.  He even had many people test it.  I know that Dunkie fitted all
this in with Night-Shift at work, his family and <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Magazine...not
to mention <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a>!!!  Why?

To be very honest, I have very little knowledge of Computers especially the,
technical side, but Dunkie helped sail me through all this even though he
received nothing in return - except my grateful thanks of course!!!

So I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Dunkie for all that he's done
- and still is doing for the UK BBS Scene.  Gone are the days when SysOps
refuse to help anyone wanting to start a BBS.  First hand I have found that
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> not only lists BBSes...IT MAKES THEM TOO!!!
