&quot;Why are you suprised, with the accessibility of greater things at people's
fingertips, that the UK BBS Scene is being so badly supported?  Flogging a
dead Horse you may be, but what can we do, as SysOps, to make the Horse
worth flogging?&quot;

My surprise don't rest with the people who call BBSes, it's the SysOps who
I'm surprised at, for not supporting the UK BBS Scene that they have thrived
on for years!  The Internet has and still is damaging the UK BBS Scene, and
basically there's nothing we SysOps can do to stop this!  But, however, we
can ease the blow by making an effort to support the existing UK BBS Scene,
and attempt to draw new people into OUR CyberSpace by advertising our BBSes
where ever possible.  A few months ago, I negotiated with AMIGA FORMAT for a
BBS Adverts section in their Magazine, and those SysOps that have advertised
in their pages have ALL seen an upward surge in their UserBase and Callers.
Yet, only a handful of SysOps have bothered to take up this free opportunity
that has been provided for them, and unfortunately it's the same story with
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> :(  ALL SysOps should be taking advantage of these opportunities
and using them to maintain the integrity of not only their own BBSes, but
also the integrity of the UK BBS Scene.  At the end of the day, the fate of
the UK BBS Scene rests in the hands of the SysOps...NOT the Internet!!!

&quot;<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is a breath of fresh air for the UK BBS Scene.  It has a good
quantity of content, and the content is interesting and of high quality.
The only problem I have with <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is that the HTML Version is almost
identical to the AmigaGuide Version.  There's no Pictures, apart from a few
Movement Control Arrows on each page!!!  I don't mean to moan, its great,
but I think HTML could have been utilised a little more i.e. when a BBS
Launches/Relaunches, add a Screen-Grab of the Log-In Screen, just to show
what it looks like.  Other than that, I don't see much that can be improved
with <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">...so keep up the good work!!!  I'm sure <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> owns a
high responsibility for keeping the UK BBS Scene together, as much as it has
done already :)&quot;

The HTML Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> was basically created for PC Users, so they
could read <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> as it was intended to be read, hence the reason why
the HTML Version is almost identical to the AmigaGuide Version.  As for the
HTML Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> not having any Pictures etc, that unfortunately
boils down to the following reasons:-

[1] I'm not versed with the HTML Language, so I'm basically just converting
    the AmigaGuide to HTML, which enables <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> not only to be read on
    every Computer Platform, but also enables the Magazine to be ported to
    a Web-Site.

[2] If I were to add Pictures, the Archive size would increase dramatically,
    and already I've had complaints about the JPEG included in the early
    <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> archives, so much so, that I no longer distribute it.

So at this moment in time, the HTML Version can't be utilised in the way
that you propose.  Ideally I'd love to produce a real glossy HTML Version
of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, one that in time could replace the AmigaGuide Version
entirely.  But until I get to grips with the HTML Language, I'm afraid this
idea may be a long way off.  Maybe you can point me in the right direction?
