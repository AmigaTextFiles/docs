TrackMaster     A small tool to help game developers create selfbooting,

                to process datafiles (join, compress, relocate, special 
                actions).  The processed data is written to disk via track-
                disk.device.  A bootblock for the first datafile, which should
                be a pc-relative loader, and a file look up table, is created 
                and written to disk.  Manual and source included.

Gwin            This is version 2.0 of GWIN restructured as an AMIGA shared
                library.  GWIN or Graphics WINdow is an integrated collection

                easy to create sophisticated graphics programs in the C envi-
                ronment.  One-line calls give you a custom screen (ten types
                available), menu items, requestors, text, circles, polygons,
                etc.  GWIN is a two-dimensional floating point graphics system
                with conversion between world and screen coordinates.  GWIN
                includes built-in clipping that may be turned off for speed.
                Use of color and XOR operations are greatly simplified.  Many
                examples of the use of GWIN are included in an examples dir-

ResetHandler    Installs a handler in the keyboard.device reset handler list
                that is called when you press CTRL-Amiga-Amiga.  It opens a
                window and counts down from 9 to 0 in ten seconds and then
                resets the machine.  This gives the machine extra time to
                do vital things like validating disks, and gives you time to
                reconsider the reboot.

                process which does the starting of the processes for you and
                then waits for the startup reply messages.

DataPlot        A program that plots data and algebraic functions in 2D.  The
                user simply clicks on an option screen to select various
                options, such as type of marker, log or linear axis, auto vs
                manual scaling, gridlines.  The macro language makes similar,
                repetitive plots easy to do.  Data points can be transformed
                by an algebraic function prior to plotting.  A macro can be
                automatically executed upon startup-up.  Plots in any resolu-
                tion from 320x200 to 640x400.  Plots can be saved as macro
                commands and IFF ILBM files.  Prints directly to Epson compa-
                tible printers, or to any Preferences supported graphics
                printer via the PLT: device.  This version now includes a

DataPlot        DataPlot is a very special function "plotter".  It does not
                really plot the data, but it creates a ".dat" file containing
                the function which you typed in and the corresponding values
                that have been calculated.  The ".dat" file can then be read in
                by "MultiPlot" (from AmigaLibDisk 467), so that you can mani-
                pulate the data with much more powerful functions than most
                normal function plotter programs offer.

Contour4D       Creates colored, altitude mapped objects for Sculpt 4D.  Two
                IFF brushes are used; one to supply the color for the object
                and a second which, by its color intensity, gives an altitude
                for the object at that point.  Objects are optimised so that
                large areas of one color and height become a single larger set
                of faces.  Objects are output in Sculpt '.scene' format.
                Works with ordinary, HAM or Extra-Halfbrite brushes.  Any
                palette colors can be omitted from conversion and all palette
                colors can be of different textures.  Full Intuition interface.

FifoLib         FIFO: is like PIPE: but is based on fifo.library rather
                than its own implementation.  Fifo.library is a general
                fifo library implementation that supports named fifos,
                writing to a fifo from a hardware exception, multiple
                readers on a fifo with each getting the same data stream,
                efficient reading, and automatic or manual flow control.

                numerical coprocessor.  The calculation routines were
                written in '881 assembly language for maximum speed and
                precision.  Also included is a `movie mode' which allows
                generation of long camera zooms to spots in the Mandelbrot
                set.  The resulting animations can be saved in ANIM-opt-5

CirclesUp       A simple little two player game where circles fly into the
                playing area from both sides of the screen.  When each player
                presses his corresponding ALT key they fly to the top of the
                screen and stop moving when they hit another circle or the
                border.  The object of the game is to connect a specified
                number of circles of the same color.

                pictures may also be generated using quick preview, shading or 
                ray-tracing. The demonstratation version allows only one of two
                structures to be displayed and does not allow space filling, 
                though some sample space-filled structures are included.  
                Version 1.03D, binary only.

RxilShell       A set of routines to form an additional layer between programmer
                & ARexx.  Rxil_shell sits on top of rxil (disk 299) & contains a
                few changes/bug fixes to the rxil routines.  With these routines
                adding ARexx support to a program becomes completely trivial.
                Version 1.0, includes C source.
