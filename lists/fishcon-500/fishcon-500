Signal          Two programs designed to make it easy to write shell scripts
                that must be synchronized with the operation of another, in
                order to avoid disk thrashing for example.  Includes source.

sWindows        A program that allows you to use the title of a window to
                specify the screen on which the window will appear.  This
                provides a method of opening CON: and RAW: windows on screens
                other than the WorkBench, for example.  Includes source.
                Author:  Davide Cervone

wIconify        A program, and number of companion utilities, that allow
                you to iconify windows on any screen, including custom
                screens. Iconified windows become small icons on the bottom
                of the screen, and they can be opened again by double-
                clicking them.  Also allows any screen to become a shared,
                WorkBench-like screen, and gives you the ability to create
                new screens specifically for this purpose.  Each window can
                have its own custom icon.  There is a programmers interface
                to allow programs to control their own icons.
                Version 3.8, includes source.

Genesis         A uniquely flexible and powerful program for generating and
                rendering fractal landscapes.  Original algorithms allow
                incorporating fractal rivers as integral parts of the
                landscapes, with natural looking river valleys, gulleys,
                waterfalls, and lakes.  A number of parameters can be varied
                to modify the landscape construction process and change the
                character of the final landscape, there is also great
                flexibility in the rendering.  This is a demo version of
                the commercial product by the same name available from
                Microillusions and has some features disabled.  Binary only.
                Author: James M. Bardeen

NoErrors        A simple to use, Gadget driven program.  Its main function
                is to hide physical hard errors from floppy disks or hard
                disks, so these disks can then be used without DOS showing

EternalRome     A historical strategy game, that in spite of its high
                complexity is fast and easy to play.  Fully mouse controlled
                with a fine zoomable map of the Roman empire (overscan and
                interlaced options).  The simulation delivers many historical
                insights because of its accuracy (may be used for educational
                purposes) and is a challenging and entertaining game for two
                or more players (also interesting for solitary studies).
                Version 1.0 (tryware).  Binary only.
                Author:  Sven Hartrumpf

ReturnCode      Two Short programs (LogRC and GetRC) to allow the "Return
                Code" left by a previous program to be saved in a form
                suitable for further (script) testing.  GetRC allows the
                Return Code to be set or viewed as desired.  Assembly
                source included.
                Author:  Jim Butterfield

SysInfo         A program which reports interesting information about the
                configuration of your machine, including some speed
                comparisons with other configurations, versions of the
                OS software, etc.  An update to version 1.98 on disk 433.
                Version 2.22.  Binary only.
                Author:  Nic Wilson

TrackDOS        A program that allows easy transfer of data between DOS,
                memory and trackdisk.device.  DOS means the data contained
                within a file, memory means the data contained anywhere
                within the memory map and trackdisk.device means data stored
                on a disk not accessable with DOS (eg. bootblocks special 
                loader disks etc.).  The transfer of data between these 
                three areas is not normally easy or convenient. TrackDos was
                written to overcome this.  An update to 1.04 on Fish disk 365.
                Version 1.08.  Binary only.

TheDatingGame   A very well done animation by Eric Schwartz.  This is Eric's
                biggest animation project to date.  The animation lasts
                nearly 4 minutes and requires 3 MB of RAM to run.  Flip the
                Frog has all kinds of trouble getting to the house of his 
                girlfriend, Clarisse Cat.  This cartoon animation follows the
                style of the short theatrical cartoons of earlier days.  The
                animation unpacks to two floppies.  Shareware.

PP              Powerpacker patcher is a small tool that patches the DOS
                library so that PowerPacker datafiles will start acting as
                if they were "normal" files.  Sample use of PP would be to
                crunch all your .info files.  They will still retain their
                functionality as long as PP is installed, and WB will never
                know the difference.  Icons are useful, but take up a lot
                of valuable disk space.  You may also use any text viewer
                or editor you desire directly on Powerpacker files!

AmiOmega        Amiga port of the Omega game.  Omega is similar to hack
                or rogue, but is much more complex.  There is a city,
                several towns, a wilderness, lots of dungeons, a multitude
                of monsters, lots of spells, magic items, etc.  There are
                several quests to complete.  All in all, it is an excellent
                game.  This is a different port than version 1.0 on disk 320.
                Version 1.5.  Binary only.

CpuBlit         CpuBlit replaces the system BltBitMap routine with a version
                that uses your 68020/68030 when it is worthwhile to do so.
                This results in text scrolling twice as fast as usual, and
                in addition, the color flicker effect normally present when
                scrolling multicolor text is removed.

                are italicized.  These features are adjustable by the user,
                to suit individual taste.  Tabbing also is adjustable, to
                harmonize with the nesting depth of a particular program.
                Output may be either on the printer, the screen, or to
                another file.  SimSmart may easily be extended by the user
                to deal with extra languages.

                Files' option of Workbench which by default only knows two
                types of file icons: Tool and Project.  If enabled scans
                all files in a directory which do not have an icon file
                supplied and tries to determine their file types.  When
                done, tricks Workbench into believing that there are proper

Chemesthetics   Chemesthetics is a program that draws molecules using the
                calotte model.  This means that atoms are drawn as bowls.
                Using this model, even extremely dangerous molecules like
                dioxine look quite nice.  Chemesthetics has an Intuition
                user interface, can save pictures as IFF files, and has
                many example files.  An update to version 2.00 on disk 427.

MatLabPatch     Patches for both Matlab and Diglib on disk 499.  The
                version of Diglib compiled for 68000 machines has some
                incorrectly compiled modules (compiled for 68020) and
                therefore causes crashes on 68000 machines.  The Plot.sub
                module compiled for 68000 machines in the Matlab archive
                was linked using the incorrect Diglib and does not run on
                68000 machines.  This update provides correctly compiled
                replacements for both those files.

PP              Powerpacker Patcher is a small tool that patches the DOS
                library so that PowerPacker datafiles will start acting
                as if they were "normal" files.  Sample use of PP would be
                to crunch all ".info" files.  The icons will retain their
                functionality as long as PP is installed, and WB will never
                know the difference.  Icons are useful, but take up a lot
                of valuable disk space.  You may also use any text viewer,
                editor or IFF tool (or anything!) you desire directly on

Spectrogram     Amiga Spectrogram computes a frequency analysis of any 8 bit
                audio data file and creates a high resolution color display
                showing frequency content versus time.  Display color is
                continuously adjustable.  This type of display when applied
                to the human voice has been called a voiceprint. This tech-
                nique has also been used to analyze sounds of many kinds of
                animals including birds, dolphins, whales, etc.  The audio
                data file can be replayed at any desired rate, giving a
                simultaneous audio and visual representation of the sample.
                A selection of interesting audio samples for analysis by
                Amiga Spectrogram is included.
