 What the heck is this? This is a listing of my democollection gathered
 through a lot of years. I've only included MAJOR productions, meaning
 that there aren't many intros included. Exceptions have been made for
 everything released at any demoparty. Don't forget to check those parts
 as they are the most worked through. 

 If you're a newcomer in the scene I can only feel sorry for you. You've
 missed the glory days of the computerscene. Today the scene is quite 
 rotten, even the demoscene is quite lousy. Nevertheless, this listing is
 a flash of the past. Still, lots of demos are released on the Amiga and
 the demoscene is far from dead. But, if nothing happens in case of new 
 Amiga models, the scene will slowly fade away. It won't die completely 
 for many years but it will most probably be like the scene is on the 
 C64 nowadays; small but talented! But, I really believe in a new strong
 computer based on todays Amiga system. It has to be strong though, we 
 don't need any more silly attempts that only divides the Amiga owners
 in many small groups. Whatever happens, for me the Amiga demoscene will 
 be the only scene worth mentioning. 
 
 If you have any comments, questions about this listing, just contact me!

  this list. If there is a hole in a democompo it doesn't mean that there
  actually isn't supposed to be any demo at that spot. This is also the 
  reason why I know include the complete results.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v3.0 (Released 15/9-1996)

* Thanks to Stefan Schroeder (Spiv/Infect) for his contributions.

  intros which competed at any party.

* Added the section @{"Video Project" link video}, make sure you check it out.

* This MAY be the last official release. If you have interest in getting up-
  dates, use the @{"Contact Me" link contact} section!

Demos Of The World - The Video! v1.0 (1996-09-11)

  contents, feel free to @{"contact me" link contact} and give me your opinion.

* !IMPORTANT! If you want to contribute, have suggestions, questions

@node ECC "EUROPEAN COMPUTER CONFERENCE 1993"
On Aug. 5-8, 1993, a demo party called ECC (European Computer Conference)
was held in Oerebro, Sweden.  Arrangers were a group called Virtual, and
the party was officially sponsored by Swedish Commodore.  Over 600 visitors
showed up.  TV21 showed up as well and went around interviewing a lot of
people.  (A few weeks later they showed some demos from the competition
along with the interviews on their Friday night show 'Metamorph'.)

@node TP1 "THE PARTY (1991)"
"Quartex Silents Anarchy, The Party 1991"

 The Party 1991 was held between December 27th and 29th, 1991 in Aars,
 Denmark.  At that time the C64 was still well represented at parties, and
 the demo competitions for the C64 and Amiga were almost the same size.
 1250 people visited the party, which made it quite a big party.  It
 has since only been exceeded by The Party II.

 Not much information was written down about the Party in 1991, only the
 2 demos with the highest ranking.  Odyssey was a long demo, a kind of
 space quest, and Hard Wired placed Silents on top of the charts for
 years!

"Crystal Silents Anarchy, The Party 1992, Part II, The Final"

 The Party II, a demo coders' gathering was held between December 27th and
 29th, 1992 in Aars, Denmark.

 2500 scene people from the whole world visited the party, which
 confirmed its status as an international party, and the biggest one.

 Three types of demos were submitted: demo and intro competitions,
 and other releases. The intros are smaller than 40KBytes.  The releases
 didn't participate any competitions, and consist mostly of disk-mags
 and compilation disks.

 A general rule for productions for the competitions was that they
 should run on an A500 with 1MB of memory, either 1MB chip ram, or with
 0.5MB chip ram and 0.5MB fast ram.

 The party also hosted music and graphics competition and competitions
 for the C64 and IBM-compatibles.

This party held in Nykoping, Sweden between the 31/3 and 2/4 wasn't any
big success. Only 150 visitors and no good competitions. The reason might
have been that the Gathering'95 in Norway is only half a month away.
At the party a CD with Amiga-music called "Best Of The Amiga Scene" was
released. It is a great celebration to the Amiga, with 18 classic Amiga
tracks. If you want to have your own copy of this CD, get in touch with
Orgasmatron/X-Trade or Snuskis/DCS Graphics.

@node A95 "ASSEMBLY'95"
The third issue of the Assembly demoparty were held in Helsinki, Finland 
between the 10th and 13th of August. The place were the party was held 
were probably one of the best ever hosting a demoparty. 4500m² with room
for 1800 computers. As the complex also hosted a normal exhibition it is
pretty difficult to decide the excact amount of visitors. Organziers 
talked about around 4000 visitors. The total priceamount were around 
$50000. The winners in the demo-compo on both PC and AMIGA got $4500 each.  
All demos were of high quality but very much all the same. Jaco/VD won
the animation competition with an incredible animation rendered on an 
A1200/030 machine. This animation have been released but I don't know 
if that's the complete compo-version. Release version is a 10,5MB sized
MPEG encoded animation.
Winning PC demo "Stars: Wonders OF The World" from Noon was a awesome

Only 200 peoples came, but if you look at the name of the groups and the
quality of demos released all the elite french scene was here... The place
was really cool and the weather also hot! Organization was good, the
restaurant offered a good choice of food and drinks. Anyway due to the few
people, organizers got some financial problems...

@node r95 "PARTY REMEDY'95 - SWEDEN"
Party Remedy 1995 was held in Solna a suburb to Stockholm between the 7-9
of October. Arranging groups were DCS, Limited Edition and Rebels PC. The
organizing team had hopes of around 800 visitors but only 300 showed up.
Competitions were really good compared to the amount of persons who
actually showed up. 40 modules entered the 4 channel compo and the Amiga
democompetition was quite ok.

With an excellent piece of art, Razor 1911 brought some of the lost honour
back to the swedish demoscene. Excellent code, excellent music and decent
graphics is what this demo has to offer. Really nice to see Mantronix back
for a guestplay!

Only placed 11th in the compo but I really enjoyed this demo as one of the
few compo demos who relied on more then complex graphic-objects. A really
cool intro-animation doesn't make it worse. Ordinary but nice!

Excellent song to make a demo to, it really has something to say even in

that's nice to reckon!

Probably the best Mystic demo ever. Notice the extremely high quality of
the graphics from all three involved graphicians. Ordinary coding but nice
design and good music. Really nice end-tune.

this surprise from Scoopex. A nice trackmo on two disks with a really nice
introduction. Made proves his place as one of the absolutely best Amiga-
graphicians of 1995!

Recommended for this demo is a 68030/25 and I really understand that be-
cause this demo is dead slow on my 020/14 (With fastram). As a matter of
fact i don't have much positive to say about the meaning in making these
kinds of graphic-objects on the Amiga1200. Although this demo is pretty 
good and you can atleast imagine how it would look on a fast Amiga. 
In the info-file it states that the demo could possibly work on an Amiga 
without fastmem. But believe me, you don't want to see it on a clean 1200.

Juliet&Case succeeded in becoming number five in two Assembly compos in a 
row (94-95). I liked their demo for Assembly'94 (CCCP) and I think that 
this one is really nice aswell. One thing that annoys me though is the 
very dark color-choices. Maybe that has something to do with the "message"
the demo wants to tell!?

simple most people would say but the skill of the animations is really
nice and enertaining to watch. Something completely different!

Another demo which goes under the statement "Ordinary but nice". A cool
raytraced animation at the end lifts the overall impression. Great GFX
especially from wellknown Teewaan.

Another trackmo which got released in a time where I though trackmos did
not exist in the top of the demoscene. This demo is a great exception 
though. The winner of the democompetition at GASP'95 is a demo with very
good coding and some really evolutionary vector-parts. Minus for not
supporting extra-drive.

Recomended configuration is 030/50/8MB fast. But I have seen slower demos
than this on my A1200/6MB, believe me! This demo features some heavy code-
work but I think that their earlier demo Noxzema were better.

One of the funniest demos ever made. Say what you want about Rage's polit-
ical aspects but they sure know how to entertain. The two disk digitized
animation is really amsuing with morphing of a Volvo into a Starwars ship.
And the parody on the "State Of The Art" demo is quite funny. If I don't
rememeber wrong I think that only the anim-part of the demo were actually
shown at the Assembly'94. Too bad as the "real" demo part have quite high
quality. Doesn't support x-drives (In an old fashioned way.. ;-))

All top-3 demos from the Assembly'95 looked the same. And they also had
demands of fast CPU's to really enjoy the demo. Complex objects and not
much of a real demo in my opinion. Leave this kind of demos to the PC!

Not much to say really. Don't know if the credits are correct, just stole
them from the Miracles demo. I have a strange feeling that it is at least
ALMOST them same persons who have made this demo. Faster graphic-objects
than in the Miracles demo though.

Especially the quality of the design is really up and down throughout the
whole demo. Second at the Party Remedy'95.

First version released at the Assembly'94, but as far as I can remember
it wasn't shown in its full length. Maybe they didn't manage to get it
all together in time. Anyway, this demo is really awesome with no doubt
the most smashing first-part EVER. The soundeffects by Zoltar is totally
awesome. All in all I think that this shows that those guys, who also gave
us "Odyssey" a couple of years earlier, are among the alltime BEST demo-
makers.

The biggest (8.6MB on harddrive) demo ever made for the A1200!? This is
a awesome demo from a bunch of hungarians. Who would have thought that the
hungarian Amiga-scene would reach such standard a couple of years ago.
My favoritepart is a kind of Super Stardust warplevel look-a-like. If you
have the computerpower to run this demo, don't you dare to miss it!

Polka Brothers continued their extravaganza with this excellent piece of

minor "bugs". Firstly it doesn't support HardDrive at all and secondly I
think it is a little bit too long. Although, it is a demo you can't afford

The winner at THE PARTY4 is what you can call a perfectly designed demo.
I haven't noticed any bugs at all and the demo runs on very naturally. Too
bad that the endscroller contains somekind of personal aggressions towards
Lord Helmet/Spaceballs. I don't know the background but there must have
been another way "solving" the problem. This can't take away the pride of
this marvellous demonstration though.

This demo is probably the most prefectly put-together demo ever. To fit 
everything the show has to offer onto *1* disk is somekind of a miracle.
Also, the main-theme by Jester is the best demotune I've ever heard. A 
really speedy song which really makes the demo *better*. The first version
of this demo was released at THE PARTY4. Due to some harddrive crashes 
they had problems with making the demo complete. I guess that this final
version would have done better in the democompetition at TheParty4. 
But why don't they use AGA graphics when the demo requires a 68020 anyway?

Another amazing demonstration from the finnish group Virtual Dreams. This
time they really try to aim high by putting in hundreds of different 
routines. Unfortunately it ends up with an average design. A very annoying
fact is that the first music stops abruptly. This could of course have 
been forced by the demo-deadline at TheParty4. Overall it is still an 
impressing demo with really good *coding*. (But, where are the credits??)

One of the best coders ever once again proved he should be on top. This 
demo is a sequel to the winning demo at TheParty3 (Complex, Origin). I 
really like the way Gengis is handling vectors and texturemapped stuff. 
He seems to be a really mathematic kind of person!? This demo finished 
number two on TheParty4 and I guess it was the DOOM-clone part that really
set the voters on fire. Later on they have also released a DOOM type-of 
game called Fears. Go and buy it and do these fellows a favour!

Sanity's first attempt to smash incredible amounts of data onto one single
disk. It is a really nice demo which really brought the good old A500 to 
its outer limits. Really nice music, this time by Moby.

Another masterpiece made by the norwegians in Andromeda. This one starts
with a really nice roller-coaster routine. Matched with the music it makes
you really impressed. All in all this is a "perfect" demo with many new
and excellent routines. Deserved to win the compo at the Gathering'94!

The masters of intros finally decided to make a demo. The result is really
impressive. Some really nice routines taking advantage of fastmem in a 
truely nice way. Unfortuantely the demo has a sudden end which I presume
was caused by the demo-deadline at Assembly'94?

The winning demo at TheParty3 made by, at that time, the french division
of Complex. Gengis proves he has got quite some coding-skill. All in all
a very nice demo with an excellent introduction. Four good graphicians 
don't make this worse. Gengis, Made and Clawz later on formed an software
company named Bomb and also released a couple of demos under this label.

The whole demo is based upon awesome raytraced animations. The animations
are also very professional made.

A cooperation between one group and another cooperation (?) gave us this 
nice picece of production at The Gathering'95. This demo was outstanding 
at the Gathering as almost every opponent was CRAP. Not prefect but very
close in my opinion... Excellent graphics by top-graphician Destop.
