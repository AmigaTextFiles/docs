              @{b}Foundation V1.21b @{ub}(24th Feb 1999)
           * Free from Distribution Restrictions *
--------------------------------------------------------------------

@{b}Note 1:@{ub} V1.2b was the last official Foundation Update. New versions
are released without warranty. Update 21 is the first release to fall
into this category. Please do not purchase the commercial version of the
game based solely on the features/abilities of these new versions. There
is no guarantee that these Update will work on your system. These further
updates are provided for FREE and are developed in my spare time for non
commercial purposes. Apart from this small (yet important) disclaimer I
hope to continue updating the game as usual for quite some time.

@{b}Note 2:@{ub} The Beta is not compatable with any Demo version. I will
release a new demo in good time.

@{b}Note 3:@{ub} You don't require any previous Update archives. All changes
that have been made since the original CD release are included with
every update archive.

@{u}Known Problems@{uu}

The Anim playback is disabled until a future release. I din't want
to rush this part of the Update, especially now that the Anim needs
to be compatable with the new "Window Mode".

Double Buffering for RTG mode is disabled (The Prefs option doesn't
have any affect). Double Buffering is only really necessary when
you're using a screen mode that is too big for your GFX bandwidth.
Users with Zorro 2 running the game in 640x480 will notice this!

@NODE "Debug" "Debug Version"

A debug version is only available from the Support Site and will not be
found in Aminet versions. The debug version is used to help those who are
experiencing rare compatability problems. There isn't always a Debug
version available. In the past I've noticed the debug version is downloaded
1000's of times and only one or two people actually send a report file.
This means 1000's of downloads for NO reason! That explains why the
debug version is not always available.

The game works fine on all 020, 030, 040 and 060 Amigas and also works well
with all tested graphics cards together with CyberGraphX and/or Picasso96.

If you do have problems running the game then you should first:-

Try running the game with a lowres screen mode before trying bigger screens.
Ensure you have the latest version of CyberGraphX or Picasso96.
Try running the game with CDDA turned off if you suspect CD Audio problems.

If you still have problems then you can run the debug version of the game. This will
create a report file in the main Foundation directory called FoundationDebug.report
Then send the report file to me at <burkey@bigfoot.com> and I will examine the
results for potential problems. Also, give me some other details such as Amiga setup,
description of problem.

* WARNING for Debug version *

The game will write the report file as it is running the game. Each file write will
open/write/close the file... It is unlikely that the game would crash durring this
stage and at all other times the file will be closed. BUT there is a small chance
that a crash could invalidate your Hard Drive so beware! If you can install the
game to a Zip disk, recoverable Ram disk or other safe device then that might be
the safest solution.

@NODE "Install" "Installation"

@{u}Important Upgrading Notes@{uu}

From V1.21 there is a big installation change. You must now install
everything you need to HD before you can run the game. The Install
groups at the top of the Installation page in FoundationPrefs are
needed to run the game. You must (re)install ALL of these items. The
other Install Groups (Anims and Mugshots) are optional. You don't need
to install these but unless you install to HD they can not be used in
the game.

A FULL install is 65Meg and a minimal install is only 35Meg! The
installation process takes 1000's of files from the Foundation CD
and converts them to new converted/compressed file formats. It deals
with over 100Meg of data in various formats and this takes a lot of
time so Please be patient! I've added a progress indicator to make
the installation process more intuitive.

It is highly recomended that you delete Foundation Installation and
install a fresh version with the new FoundationPrefs. This is to
avoid possible problems with outdated file formats but also to avoid
having 1000's of unused files on your HD.

Once you have installed and saved your new preferences you can start
Foundation using the new single exe. The RTG and AGA versions of
the game are now obsolete. The "Foundation" exe will detect AGA/RTG
from your screen mode prefs. It's even possible to mix AGA/RTG modes
for the menu and game screens.

@{u}Important Upgrading Notes from Update 16 and earlier@{uu}

Durring Update installation you must also copy the "FoundUpd" directory
into your Foundation instilation directory. This new directory contains
extra graphics and data files. Please note that you do NOT need to copy
individual files from the FoundUpd directory. The FoundUpd directory
is copied "as is" into the root of your Foundation directory.

@ENDNODE
 

@NODE "CustSound" "Custom Sounds"

The custom samples are standard IFF-8SVX sounds which are named using the rules
described below.  The samples are placed in a new directory called "CustSound/"
which will be located in the root of your Foundation installation. If you run the
new version of FoundationPrefs (V1.53 of higher) the Directory will be created
for you. When you run the FoundationPrefs program it will ensure this directory
exists and it will create an index file called CustSound.dat there. This index
file tells Foundation (V1.03 and higher) a little about the available samples.
Using the new "Custom Sounds" page of FoundationPrefs will show you which sounds
are available and you can also Test them to be sure that they are real 8SVX sounds.

@{u}Character Speech@{uu}

There are three classes of characters in Foundation. The most common is the "male"
class which covers Peasants, Wizards and Scientists. Next is the Soldier class
which covers all battle units. There is also a "Maiden" class. Each character has
4 simple phrases.

   Hello   - a general greeting, used when you select the character.
   Ok      - an acknowledgement, used when you give a 'good' command.
   No      - a refusal, used when you give an illegal command.
   Already - phrase used when you make a command that is already being executed.

Instead of using a messy number system I have built in a name system so
you can give each character a name, for example we may give our first
male character the name "baz". To add a "Hello" sample to "baz" we would
give the sample the name "male-baz-hello0". Now this has added a new
sample set to the "male" class. One "Hello" sample is all you need to
add a new character but I recomend you to use at least one of each type
for example...

male-baz-hello0
male-baz-ok0
male-baz-no0
male-baz-already0

This has added a full range of speech to a new "male" character called "baz".
You could add extra samples by giving them higher numbers so we may have
9 or more samples for this character for example...

male-baz-hello0
male-baz-ok0, male-baz-ok1, male-baz-ok2, male-baz-ok3
male-baz-no0, male-baz-no1
male-baz-already0, male-baz-already1

For Maidens you would use something like "maiden-sally-hello0"
For Soldiers you would use something like "soldier-raj-hello0"

The most common speech is the "ok" sample so please try to use at least 2
"ok" samples for each character. As I mentioned, 1 "hello" sample is the
minimum needed for a character but you should try to add a full range. If
a phrase is missing for your character you will not hear any sound for
that particular phrase.

I have created a small example set of custom speech samples to explain how
this all works. The archive is called FoundCustSpeech.lha and it should be
available on the support web site, Aminet and wherever you found this file!
