That patch applies to Castle Master (c) 1990 Incentive Software/Domark.

This install has the slave-version 1.00.
It needs WHDLoad 1.98 or higher in the path (eg in c:). 

Fixed:  Sound replay.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes:	That install features the partial-os-emulation by the WEPL/
          Mr.Larmer/me. Due the big files the install is this time even 
          useable with few ram.
        Select your language with CUSTOM1 (1-deutsch, 2-english, 
          3-français), since im not going to implement screen- and 
          windowmanagement in the OSEmu for a cli-selections-menu.
          However i cant recommend playing the german version since
          it has some serious translation errors.
        I recommend playing the game without caches, since its a bit
          too fast with (but runs).

The install is tested with on a 2 MB A1200 and on an 18 MB 68030. 

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
