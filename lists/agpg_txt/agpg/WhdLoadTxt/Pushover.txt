That patch applies to Pushover (c) 1992 Red Rat Software/Ocean.

This install has the slave-version 1.11.
It needs WHDLoad 10.0 or higher in the path (eg in c:). 
You need also an installed xfddecrunch-package (from /aminet/util/pack/xfd* 
- this is got to be renamed from time to time, atm its xfdmaster*).

Fixed:  Sound is now played properly.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes:	That install features the partial-os-emulation by the WEPL/
          Jeff/Mr.Larmer/me.

Known Bug: If you try to play the whole game at once it will crash in
          about level 90. I wont fix that, since i dont have the time
          for that, and whdload will catch the crash.

The install is tested with on a 2 MB A1200 and on an 18 MB 68030. It needs
at least 920 k Chipmem and 500 k other mem.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
