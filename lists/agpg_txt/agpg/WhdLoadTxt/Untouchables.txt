	That patch applies to The Untouchables (c) 1990 Ocean (2 disk version).


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and Patcher from
	the whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F9.

	full whdload package:	aminet:dev/misc/whdload#?.lha
	other installs:		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload.html

	Fixed: Wrong access to memory in level 3.
	       Lots of wrong opcodes used in 'blitter wait' function.

	Thanx to Chris Vella for original disks image.
