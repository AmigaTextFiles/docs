;--- Super Offroad HD install V1.2

This installer requires the original Super Offroad disk.

You have to install WHDLoad first.

V1.2	- Support for the NTSC version added

V1.1	- Slave now fully pc-relative

The NTSC tooltype is set by default. If you have the PAL game you may disable it,
if you want.

The decode routine for the imager was written by Harry, thanks for allowing
me to use it. Greetings also to Wolfgang Unger who sent me his PAL original.

Thanks to Chris Vella for sending me his NTSC original.

Credits to Morbidus for his help setting the NTSC tooltype.  ;)
