Short : HD-Installer for Cloud Kingdoms V1.0 (30-Dec-1998)
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Cloud Kingdoms" by Millenium (c) 198? - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.4 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD (diskimage is shortened)
- RNC disk protection removed (2x)
- MWB icon (ripped by Midwik, created by JHZ)
- Quit option (your default key)

Note:
  Install doesn't support Kid Gloved demo on disk. K.G. demo size is
about 40% of disk, so I decided to trash it because save hd/mem space.

Thanks to Lempkee for disk image.
