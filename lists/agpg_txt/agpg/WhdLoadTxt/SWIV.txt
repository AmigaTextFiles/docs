	That patch applies to SWIV (c) 1991 Sales Curve (1 disk version).


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and Patcher from
	the whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10.

	Thanx to:

	Harry for original disk image,icon image, help with disk imager
	and scores display. Now game display correctly scores, because
	Harry changed this bug.

	Brad Avery (Toronto,Ontario,Canada) for bugs report.

	Now this game working fine on all Amigas, but first time only
	on 68000 processor machines. I find three stack frame format errors
	and one check memory error.

	The Tooltype NOVBRMOVE must be set, otherwise the keyboard does not
	work.
