That patch applies to Unreal (c) 1990 Ordilogic Systems/Ubi Soft,
PAL- and NTSC-version.

This install has the slave-version 1.11 and the imager-version 1.01.
It needs WHDLoad 1.1 and The Patcher1.05 or higher in the path 
(eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:  Protection caused a stackframe error.
        Keyboard handling.
        Lots of blitwaits inserted.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Cheat mode: Type ORDILOGICUS in the title screen. The border should
          flicker if it was successful.

Note:   The tooltype BUTTONWAIT is set in the icon, remove it if you have
          seen the loading pictures long enough.

Known bug: Sometimes there are rectangles to see at the right border.
          That comes due the different timing on faster cpus, i fear you
          have to live with it. I think its not too annoying.

Comment: It was heavily protected, so that one took me about 55 h to 
          patch. I hope you appreciate it, I think it IS worth it.

Thanks to Jeff for some initial work.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
