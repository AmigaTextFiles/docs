				0.5 MB Other

	Notes:
	This patch requires whdload v0.1348 or later.
	Bugfix: Now functions with v7.0.

	You can save/load upto 10 different games on your hd.
	Read the "Install Notes" about tranfering old saves from floppy->hd.
	Bugfix: Now you really *can* transfer your old games.

	Now supports the budget version and the original version (which
	apparently has no intro?).
	
	Thanks to Wolfgang Unger for the originals (bloodwych budget and 
	extended levels) and to Jean-Francois Fabre and Earendil who both
	sent me the other version.

	A NewIcon for the game can be found in the icons drawer.
	It was provided by Dark Angel.
	Also a 16 color MWB icon can be found, courtesy of Brice Terzaghi.
	archive. Thank you both.
