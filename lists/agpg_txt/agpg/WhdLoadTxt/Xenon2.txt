	That install applies to "Xenon 2" © 1988,1991 The Bitmap Brothers.
	It supports 3 floppy disk and the CDTV version of Xenon 2.

	That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.

	You need 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").

	Features:
	 - some access faults removed
	 - highscores will be saved
	 - trainer added, gives 100000 cash and 9 fighters, trainer will be
	   enabled via Tooltype Custom1, if trainer is enabled the highscores
	   wont be saved
	 - in the CDTV version Custom2 redirects the left mouse button to the
	   fire button B (if you don't have a joypad)
	 - CD music control from the game is currently impossible (CDTV), 
	   maybe there will be a future version of WHDLoad which makes it
	   possible

	if you have problems with this installation please try first to get
	a newer version of this install from 
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
