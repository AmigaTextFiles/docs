That patch applies to Gemx (c) 1990/1991 Demonware/Kaiko, original
version and Amigafun-rerelease.

This install has the slave-version 1.1 and the imager-version 2.00.
It needs WHDLoad 0.608 and The Patcher1.05 or higher in the path 
(eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:	Keyboard didnt work on my A1200, i wonder that the routine did ever
	 work on an A500.
	Delays fixed at several positions.
        The AmigaFun-version is the most crappy rerelease i have ever seen.
         The end sequence and all extra words caused crashs due 
         unpatched loading routines (they changed the disk format).
         This is now fixed.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes: 	Try threed, credits or strip in the titlescreen and see what 
	 happens :).
        The AmigaFun-version saves now also its highscores.

The install is tested with 2 MB and PRELOAD on an A1200.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
