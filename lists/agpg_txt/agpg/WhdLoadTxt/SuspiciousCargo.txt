;--- Suspicious Cargo HD install [registered users only]

This installer requires the two original Suspicious Cargo disks.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

Suspicious Cargo requires 1 MB chip.

If you have not yet registered WHDLoad, this patch will NOT work. You will return
to the workbench right after the intro.

Note that there are still some bugs in this game, it isn't my task to recode the
whole thing. Especially the cancel-requesters are not working correctly. So
better think before acting. By the way - I did not crack the code protection, it
just doesn't appear. Probably due to wrong stack handling. Well - don't expect
too much from this game...

Thanks to Wolfgang Unger for sending me his original & thoroughly beta-testing.
