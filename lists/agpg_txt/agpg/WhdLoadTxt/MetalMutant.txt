	That install applies to "Metal Mutant" © 1991 Silmarils.


	That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
	the WHDLoad package.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").


	if you have problems with this installation please try first to get
	a newer version of this install from 
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
	if that does'nt help try some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC,
	NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. if that also does'nt help inform the
