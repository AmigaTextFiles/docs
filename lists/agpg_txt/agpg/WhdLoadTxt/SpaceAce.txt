That patch applies to Space Ace (c) 1989 Readysoft. 2 versions supported.

This install has the slave-version 1.10 and the imager-version 1.01.
It needs WHDLoad 0.608 and The Patcher1.05 or higher in the path 
(eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:  Some access faults.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Cheat mode: To watch the entire game first press the return-key, then
          type dodemodexter .

Note:   Although it runs from a technical view without preloading
          the disks, its completely useless with fewer than 6 MB ram,
          since it loads permanently.

Comment: Due its strange multiinterrupt-disksystem it was hard work
          to install that one.

The install is tested on a 2 MB A1200 and on an 18 MB 68030. 

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
