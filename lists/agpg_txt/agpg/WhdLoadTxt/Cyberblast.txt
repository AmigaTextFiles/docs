	That patch applies to Cyberblast (c) 1990 Innerprise Software (1 disk version).


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and Patcher from
	the whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing Help.


	for problems contact:	mrlarmer@union.medianet.pl
	full whdload package:	aminet:dev/misc/whdload#?.lha
	other installs:		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload.html


	Save high score not supported, yet.

	My disk version of game is wrongly coded and some levels can't be
	loaded correctly. So, if you have good working version let me know.


	Thanx to Harry for original disk image.
