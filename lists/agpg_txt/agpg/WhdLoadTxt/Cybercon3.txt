	That install applies to "Cybercon 3" © 1991 US Gold.


	That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing DEL (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=")


	Press F9 to open locked doors.


	Currently three versions are supported, you can identify them in
	the startmenu, one shows "CYBERCON III (4/6/91)" and the other
	shows "CYBERCON III (8/6/91)".
	The third version also shows "CYBERCON III (8/6/91)". It has only
	very small differences to the other 8/6.
