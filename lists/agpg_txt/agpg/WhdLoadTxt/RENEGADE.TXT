This patch applies to "Renegade" by Taito (c) 1989 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD V8+ for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.0 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD (original loader was terrible slow)
- Game is no longer resetproof
- RNC Disk protection removed (Thanks Quartex)
- Trainer option (set CUSTOM1=1 for unlimited energy)
- MWB icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

Thanks to Chris Vella for disk image and betatesting.

Enjoy the game on your hd.
