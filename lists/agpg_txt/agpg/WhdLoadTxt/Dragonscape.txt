Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz)

This patch applies to "Dragonscape" by Free Spirit/Wicked Software (c) 1988-89 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD V10+.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.6 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full loading from HD
- Blitter waits inserted (7x)
- CPU depending loops removed (11x)
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

HISTORY:

V1.0 (30-Nov-1998) - first public release
V1.1 (08-Jun-1999) - patch uses non-relocated executable now (re-install)
                   - slave optimized (decruncher and some useless code removed)
                   - speed fix removed due complains of patch users
                   - game fixed for snoop modes
                   - icon changed

Look for the cheat in Sweet Cheater.
