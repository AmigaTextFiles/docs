Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Dynasty Wars" by US Gold/Tiertex (c) 1990 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V8+) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.8 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Disk protection removed (78 Track Master)
- Intro skip option added (set CUSTOM1=1 for intro skip, CUSTOM1=0 for normal start)
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ and me)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

Thanks to Chris Vella for disk image and betatesting.
