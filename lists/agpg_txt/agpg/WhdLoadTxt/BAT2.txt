;--- B.A.T. II HD install [registered users only]

This installer requires the five original B.A.T. II disks. It supports the
German, the English and the French version.

You have to install WHDLoad first.

You need 1MB chip.

If you have not yet registered WHDLoad, this patch will NOT work. You will return
to the workbench right after the character creation. As long as there are only a
handful of registrations while the download counters grow week by week I will
stop making patches only limited in saving to HD.

Thanks to Wolfgang Unger for sending me his original and beta testing.
