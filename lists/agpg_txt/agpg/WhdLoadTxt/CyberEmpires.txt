;--- Cyber Empires HD install V1.1 [registered users only]

This installer requires the two original Cyber Empires disks.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

You need 1 MB chip.

If you have not yet registered WHDLoad, this patch will NOT work. You will return
to the workbench right after the title picture.

V1.1	- Removed a game bug which caused jammed cyborgs in case too many lrm
	  were fired. Thanks to Sam & Angus Manwaring for report and beta
	  testing.

Thanks to Angus Manwaring for sending me his original. Without him this patch
would not exist.  =)
