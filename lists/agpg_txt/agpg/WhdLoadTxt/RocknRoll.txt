That patch applies to RocknRoll (c) 1989 Rainbow Arts, both original and
rerelease version.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.03 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Stackframe error.
	Several dbf-delays replaced.
	Crash after completion of the game (hopefully) fixed (Not tested 
	 already, completing the game with the shortest way takes at
	 least 2.5 h and 2 times testplaying is enough to me).

Default quitkey is numerical *. You may change it in the icon with QUITKEY= .

Notes: 	Try COUNTRY or MAGIC MAP instead of your name, or the levelchoice
	with RAINBOW ARTS . Magic number for levelchoice is aaxxbbbbxxcc.
	Hereby is aa the level you want and cc the level backwards, and
	sum of bbbb gives the levelnumber. Example: 25XX6667XX52.
	Do not edit the highscorefile, or the game wont work anymore.

Additional note: There is one defective charge of that rerelease. I managed
	to restore the defective data and included it (encrypted) in the
	imager. If you have that charge too (it crashes in level 7 or 8) you
	need to install your very original disk and not a backup, or the
	defective track (#5) cant be recognized and will not be restored.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.
