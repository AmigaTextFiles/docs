	That install applies to "Colorado" © 1990 Silmarils.


	That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
	the WHDLoad package.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").

	a newer version of this install from 
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
