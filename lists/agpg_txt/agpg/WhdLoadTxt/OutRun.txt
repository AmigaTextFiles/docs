	That install applies to "OutRun" © 1988 Sega.


	That install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC V1.3 to be in the path.
	Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").


	Highscores will be saved to HD.


	1.0:

	Initial release, for the Klassix re-release.


	1.1:

	Support for two other versions of the game. One is a completely
	different version, the other is just a second version of the
	Klassix re-release with a different bootblock.


	1.2:

	Support for another two versions.
	Timer fixed. The counting speed depends on the frame rate.
	CUSTOM tooltypes introduced to control maximum frame rate and
	timer speed. (Look below)


	Different versions of OutRun:

	Currently there are 5 versions supported. Up to now I can
	devide these two versions into two main versions which show
	major differences between each other.

	First there are the old releases which have a picture while
	loading showing "© 1987", then there are the newer releases
	showing "© 1988" while loading.

	The "© 1988" version has several advantages to the others:

	1. Loading screen with moving starfield, not just a picture.

	2. While demo, the game looks a lot more like the arcade
	   showing the "true" OutRun logo and (obsolete) stuff like
	   "1 CREDIT" etc.

	3. Easier playing since the timer is not so close anymore.

	4. Absolutely different disk layout. The older versions were
	   in an Amiga-like format. The new one has a completely
	   independent track format.

	5. Disk protection.

	6. Different keyword for the cheatmode.

	7. The debug output is not disabled and can be accessed via
	   cheatmode.


	Tooltypes:

	The CUSTOM1 tooltype controls the frames per renderstep.

	CUSTOM1 may vary from 1 to 8, while 1 is 50 FPS and 8 is 6.25 FPS.
	To calculate the FPS-rate, use following formulas:

	PAL:	50/CUSTOM1
	NTSC:	60/CUSTOM1

	For A500 speed, use "CUSTOM1=7" on PAL and "CUSTOM1=8" on NTSC.


	The CUSTOM2 tooltype affects the counter directly. Since the
	counting speed was decreased in later versions of OutRun, I
	offer you this tooltype to decide what counter speed you
	would like to have.

	Only three values are allowed for CUSTOM2:

	CUSTOM2=0	Default (will set CUSTOM2 to either 4 or 5,
			depending on your OutRun version).

	CUSTOM2=4	Fast timer, like in the early versions of OutRun.

	CUSTOM2=5	Slow timer, like in the later versions of OutRun.


	if you have problems with this installation please try first to get
	a newer version of this install from 
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
	if that doesn't help try some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC,
	NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. if that also doesn't help inform the
	author via the Bug-Report-Form which can be accessed on
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/

	for full WHDLoad package and other installs refer to:
