	That install applies to "Virus" © 1988 D.J.Braben.


	That install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path.
	Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.


	You need 0.6 MB ChipMem and 0.6 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").


	Highscores are saved to HD.

	This game needs 544 KB ChipMem instead of 512 KB because of
	some memory leaks in the render routines which make Virus
	write to some adresses beyond the 512 KB border.


	if you have problems with this installation please try first to get
	a newer version of this install from 
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
	if that doesn't help try some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC,
	NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. if that also doesn't help inform the
	author via the Bug-Report-Form which can be accessed on
