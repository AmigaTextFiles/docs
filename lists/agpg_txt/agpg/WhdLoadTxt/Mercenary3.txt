That patch applies to Mercenary 3 (c) 1991 Novagen.
2 versions are supported.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Program runs now with enabled caches.
	The protection of the copyprotected version failed on 68020+, removed.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.
To quit hold fire down, then press the quitkey. I did this because all 
keys could be used.

Notes:  Since the program was somewhat slow on 68000 it was no fun to
          play it. Now its faster, but the timing is wrong. Either
          i would have to slow it down (eg with no caches) or recode,
          and both is not worth the result, since the speed is rather
          an advantage.
        The program is not fully tested, since i havent solved it until
          now. Please report any bugs, protections or access faults.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
