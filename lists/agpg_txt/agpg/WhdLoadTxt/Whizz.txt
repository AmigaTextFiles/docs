Short : HD-Installer for Whizz V1.0 (10-Dec-1998)
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Whizz" by Flair Software (c) 1995 - 2 disks.
Supported version is AGA from Escom A1200 Amiga Pack.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7.0) for run.
Game requires 2.0 MB Chip Mem and AGA machine (+ 1.8 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Decruncher relocated to Fast RAM
- NI/MWB icon (ripped by Midwik, created by JHZ)
- Quit option (your default key)

Note:
  Decruncher was very very slow, it flies now. There is also another hd patch
for Whizz, but it has no quit option and I love to relocate decrunchers :).
 If you have unsupported version, contact me.

Enjoy :)
