That patch applies to Hybris (c) 1988 Discovery International.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Protection prevented the program from running on 68020+. Removed.
        Some dbf-delays replaced.
        Access fault.
        Keyboard interrupt and internal keyboard handling.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Cheat mode: When the demo displays the highscore type COMMANDER.
          Now you can toggle invulnerability with F10, F9 skips to next 
          stage, F7 lets you switch the weapon with F1-F6.

Notes: The disk contains the NTSC- and PAL-version. I recommend playing
	 the PAL-version, its easier and has a bigger screen to maneuvre.
         The NTSC-version is just that senseless hard like other 08/15-
         shoot-em-ups.
       Once you used the cheatmode the game wont save highscores this 
         run-time anymore.
       The imager is a bit slow, so be patient.
       There were reported still problems with the NTSC-version. Ill 
         check this.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.
