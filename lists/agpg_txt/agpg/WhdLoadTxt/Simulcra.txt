	That install applies to "Simulcra" © 1990 Graftgold.


	That install requires WHDLoad and The Patcher to be in the path.
	Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing ESC (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").


	The CUSTOM2 to CUSTOM4 tooltypes activate different
	trainers, the CUSTOM1 tooltype is reserved for future use.


	Highscores will be saved when no trainers are used.


	The slave still is still unfinished as it needs NOVBRMOVE to work.
	It will be a lot of work to fix this since there are a lot of
	TRAPV's in the game code.


	if you have problems with this installation please try first to get
	a newer version of this install from
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
	if that does'nt help try some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC,
	NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. if that also does'nt help inform the
	author via the Bug-Report-Form which can be accessed on
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
