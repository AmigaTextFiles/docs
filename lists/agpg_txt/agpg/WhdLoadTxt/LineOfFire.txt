Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Line of Fire" by Sega/US Gold (c) 1990 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V8.1) for run.
Game requires 1.0 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.8 other memory for preload option)
Install requires XFD package in path.

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Disk protection removed
- 24 bit access fault fixed
- Blitter error in control menu fixed
- NI/MWB icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (your default key)

Cheat (taken from Sweet Cheater):
   In control menu type "OPERATION FERRET". Control type will be switched
to "acid". Now you got unlimited credits and you can choose mission by
1-8 keys.

Thanks to Chris Vella for disk image and betatesting.
