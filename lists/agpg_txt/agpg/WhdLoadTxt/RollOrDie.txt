Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@post.cz)

This patch applies to "Roll or Die" by Animators (c) 1992 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V1.1) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.8 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Quit option (your default key)
- Save hiscores to HD
- NI/MWB icon (created by JHZ, ripped by Midwik)
- Patched access faults (6x)

Note:
- this patch is not 100% MMU compatible (because highscore counter at end)
- format option is patched as quit
- you can quit only stages where game waits for joystick/mouse buttons or move
- 'save hiscore' option will quit after saving, because it's not possible to
  quit from final credits right now

To do:
- add quit to final credits
- fix access faults in highscore section

Enjoy this funny game on your hd.
