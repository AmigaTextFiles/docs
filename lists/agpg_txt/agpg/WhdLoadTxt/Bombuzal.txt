That patch applies to Bombuzal (c) 1989 Imageworks.

This install has the slave-version 1.21.
It needs WHDLoad 1.98 or higher in the path (eg in c:). 

Fixed:  Sound replay.
	Ingame timing adapted to 68000-speed.
        Problem of overwriting of AGA-registers solved.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes:	That install features the partial-os-emulation by the WEPL/
          Mr.Larmer/me. 
        I changed the program to not decrease the time while displaying
          the overview-map, before you had to hold space down to achieve
          that, so its a bit more comfortable now.
        If you have my dos-fixed version you should reinstall that one.

Enhanced: Program saves now its highscores.

The install is tested with on a 2 MB A1200 and on an 18 MB 68030. 

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
