  That patch applies to Apidya (c) 1992 Kaiko (2 disk version).

  This install contains the imager-version x.x and the slave-version 1.2.
  Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and Patcher from
  the whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.

  Fixed: Access fault.
         2-player-simultanmode works now in level 3 (if a skeleton
           animal was hit by the small bee, the player team couldnt 
           shoot anymore).

  Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.
  Default trainer key is numerical ] (QUITKEY-2). Pressing it will give 
    you limited invulnerability to small shots and enemies in that level.
  Once you used the trainer the game wont save highscores/settings this
    runtime anymore.

  You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
