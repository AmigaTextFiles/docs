	That install applies to "Turrican" © 1990 Rainbow Arts
			 and to "Turrican" © 1990 Innerprise.


	That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the whdload package.

	You need 1 MB ChipMem.
	
	This install supports the original 'Rainbow Arts', the 'Innerprise' 
	and the 'AmigaFun' rerelease version.

	You can quit the game by pressing F10 if you have a 68010 or better 
	(key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey="). Don't set tooltype 
	NOVBRMOVE, otherwise no exit is possible.
	
	This was really hard work:
	Tons of blitter waits inserted. Should run with caches enabled now.
	Because the additional blitwaits it may run a bit slower on lean
	machines.
	7 copylock routines removed (in Level 1,2,4,4,5,5,5).
	New random generator because the old one has read the ROM area.
	
	Thanks and greetings are going to Matthew Holliday and Chris Vella
	for support and patience.

	Wepl.
