;--- Perihelion HD install V1.1 beta

This installer requires the four original Perihelion disks.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

You need 1 MB chip.

V1.1	- Slave now fully pc-relative
	- GFX errors removed

To install Perihelion copy the drawer to your HD, insert disk 1 into df0: and
double click on the install icon.

Notes about the beta version...

* The game does not continue after saving to HD, although the operation is
  performed correct. That means you can quit, restart and load your saved game (no
  problems here). My experience with this game tells me, that this is probably
  WHDLoad's fault. Anyway saving to HD is reserved to registered users only. BUT
  if you can live with it: Setting the tooltype CUSTOM1=1 (default) [remember that
  an early version of WHDLoad might not support this] won't patch the save
  routines, i.e. you can save to (and load from) floppy disk - of course without
  any errors.

As you can see, chances are pretty good that this problem dissolves, without me
changing anything.

This beta is for the WHDLoad page only, don't upload it to Aminet and watch for
V1.1 which will be out soon, I hope.

Thanks to Wolfgang Unger for sending me his original.
