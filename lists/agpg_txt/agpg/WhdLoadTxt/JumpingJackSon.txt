That patch applies to Jumping Jack Son (c) 1990 Infogrames.

That install has the slave-version 1.3. It needs WHDLoad 1.98 or 
higher in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Copyprotection prevented the game from running on 68020+.
        Sound is now played properly.
        Timing fixed.
        Access fault removed.

It features the OS-emulation by WEPL/Mr. Larmer/me.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
