That patch applies to Deflektor (c) 1988 Gremlin.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.02 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:	Stackframe error.
	Diskprotection removed.

Quit game with F10.

The game should run with 1 MB memory without starting the 
workbench, its tested with 2 MB ram.

Comment: A fast nonstandard one with 5 h fixing/installing time.
