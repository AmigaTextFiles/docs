;--- F-19 Stealth Fighter HD install V1.2

This installer requires the two original F-19 Stealth Fighter disks.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

Note that the installer creates an empty roster disk called disk.5. If someone
wants to have his already existing roster transferred, send me a mail.

V1.2	- Support for a second version added

V1.1	- Slave now fully pc-relative

Thanks to Wolfgang Unger for sending me his originals.
