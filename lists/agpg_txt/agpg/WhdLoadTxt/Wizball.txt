	That install applies to "Wizball" © 1987 Ocean Software Ltd.


	That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
	the whdload package.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=")


	To save disk disk space you can compress the files "whizpics" and
	"ocean.pi1" with ProPack or FImp (but without extension!).

	Some Access Fault has been removed.

	Cheat mode:
	Pause the game and type "RAINBOW", now unpause the game with FIRE.
	Now pause and press 'C' to fill the current cauldron, 'S' to skip level
	and 'T' to complete the game ('S' and 'T' works sometimes not, but I
	don't know why, just try it).


	if you have problems with this installation please report them via
