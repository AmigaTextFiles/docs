;--- Obitus HD install V1.1

This installer requires the three original Obitus disks.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

V1.1	- Removed a bug in the imager causing small dot lines in the intro

Note that due to the brilliant Psygnosis disk format you might be unable to
install the game because your drive won't find the second sync mark on the
boot track. I've got such a drive, the only solution is installing from df1:

Thanks to Wolfgang Unger for sending me his original.

Obitus is copyright by Psygnosis.
