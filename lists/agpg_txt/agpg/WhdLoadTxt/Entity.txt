Short : HD-Installer for Entity V1.0
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Entity" by Loriciel (c) 1992 - 4 disks.
Slaves require WHDLOAD V10+.
Intro requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem.
Game requires 1.0 MB Chip Mem (+ 3.1 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full loading from HD
- Disk protection removed
- RNC decruncher moved to Fast RAM
- Trainer option added (set CUSTOM1=1 for infinitive lives)
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

NOTE:
  It's possible to delete files 'INTRO','LOAD' and drawer 'PRESENT',
if you need more memory for PRELOAD and you don't want to watch intro
anymore. Or you can move intro files to different memory, you will save
some time when data are preloading ;-)


Thanks to Helmut Motzkau for disk images.
