Short : HD-Installer for Double Dragon 3 V1.1
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Double Dragon 3" by Sales Curve (c) 1991 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7.0) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem and 1.8 other memory for preload option

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- RNC decruncher relocated to Fast RAM (if CUSTOM2=1)
- RNC disk protection removed
- Disk ID check routine fixed
- Player 2 control option added (CUSTOM1 tooltype
- No icon :(
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

NOTE:
  With CUSTOM1 tooltype you can set control for player 2. Game used only keyboard for P2,
but I found joystick routine for port 2 inside of program. There's probably some
trick how to switch joystick control for player 2, but I haven't found any.
Use CUSTOM1=0 for joystick, CUSTOM1=1 for keyboard.
  CUSTOM2=1 will relocate decruncher to Fast RAM. I add custom tooltype for it,
because it didn't worked on some machines.

CHEAT (taken from Sweet Cheater):
Pause the game with 'P' and press 'F5' 9 times. Now unpause and you will get
unlimited coins.

If anybody will rip title picture from game, contact me, I need better icon.

Thanks to Marc Catchpole for disk images.
