Short : HD-Installer for American Gladiators V0.9 (26-Nov-1998)
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz)

This patch applies to "American Gladiators" by GameTek/Imagitec Design (c) 1991 - 3 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7.0) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.8 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full loading from HD
- NI/MWB icon (created by JHZ, ripped by Midwik)
- Skip intro option (set CUSTOM1=1 for skip, CUSTOM1=0 for intro)
- Quit option (your default key)
- Fixed 2x access faults in Powerball
- No need of joystick in port 0 anymore

Note:

 Diskimages are cutted for low memory consumation. Funny - game could be on
2 disks if authors were smart enough to pack the intro (or they could remove it for good ;).
I could make a file ripper, if there will be any requests.
 I bet you will appreciate skip intro option. Intro cannot be skipped originally
and you must watch whole slideshow - stupid idea. Menu was using joysticks
in both ports, this is now fixed.
 Decruncher is slowest I ever seen, but it's created by ugly way, so I'm not able
to move it in Fast RAM. I can't understand why they used RNC loader without RNC packer.
I also haven't found any disk protection.
 Well, you can see I'm enough tired of American Gladiators ;).

Bugs:

- corrupted parts of gfx in Eliminator. I think it's 'coz corrupted data, I haven't
  found any illegal blitter operations. Please, report me if you have uncorrupted
  version.

Thanks to Chris Vella for disk images and betatesting.

Enjoy another boring sport game on your hd. ;)
