This patch applies to "Catch'em" by Prestige Software (c) 1992 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V8+) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.8 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD (done with Mr Larmer's help)
- Manual protection removed
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

Thanks goes to Chris Vella for disk image and betatesting
        and to Mr Larmer for help with data file loader and for code optimisation ;).

Enjoy this cool game. I'm curious who's able to finish it :)
