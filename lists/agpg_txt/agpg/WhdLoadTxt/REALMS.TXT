	That install applies to Realms (c) 1991 Graftgold.


	That install requires WHDLoad and The Patcher to be in the path.
	Both can be found in the whdload package.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (or the key you set via 
	QuitKey=... ).
	
	
	The american version runs only in NTSC mode and the european only
	in PAL ! The install automatically detects the version and switch to
	the right display (tooltypes PAL/NTSC are therefore out of function).
	
	You may set tooltype Cache to improve speed a bit, but on my '060
	there are some sound problems with.


	if you have problems with this installation please report them via
	the Bug-Report-Form which can be accessed on
