@toc main

@{jcentre}
@{b}JWWSInstall is provided "as is" and is used at your own risk.
@{jleft}
Licence to use this package is dependent on agreeing to this condition.
If you do not agree, you should delete all files from this package now.@{ub}

Requires version 43.3 or later of the "Installer" program (or compatible).
Installer v43.3 is available for free download from Aminet:

    ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/util/misc/Installer-43_3.lha

Requires version 9.2 [build 2151] or later of the WHDLoad package
by Bert Jahn. v9.2 is included in this archive and will be installed
along with the game when you use the installer.

Requires an @{i}original@{ui} (non pirate) game disk!
This installer is unlikely to work with any pirate versions of the
game, nor will I ever modify it to do so.

Do not attempt to crunch or pack the game files (the files found in
the "data" subdirectory) or the JW_Snooker slave program. The WHDLoad
program may be packed like any normal program.

After installation is complete, you may delete the directory
produced by extracting this archive ("JWWSInstall"). All files
required for running the game will be found in the directory
created during installation.

@toc installing

Extract all files in the archive to your system. They will be
extracted to a drawer called "dist"

Open the newly created drawer and double click the "Install_JWWS"
icon located there.

Follow the instructions given to you by the Installer program!

When running the installer it is advisable to disable any virus
checking software you may have running. The original game disk
uses a non-standard bootblock which will most likely cause your
virus checker to complain and this could interefere with the
installation process. It is not necessary to disable such programs
before playing the game once it is installed.

During the installation process, multitasking must be disabled
temporarily while the game data is copied from the floppy to
your hard disk. For this period you will not be able to do
anything else with your Amiga. @{b}DON'T PANIC@{ub} - this is normal.

The game will be installed to a directory you select on your
hard drive. You will be alerted @{"if installation fails" link trouble} for any
reason.

@rem -----------------------------------------------------
@node instsave "JWWSInstall - Installing Saved Games"
@toc installing

You have the option to install saved game positions and score
information during the main game installation process or at a
later date.

An installer script will be placed in the directory you choose
to install the game in and clicking on its icon will allow you
to @{b}overwrite@{ub} any current saved game information held on your
hard drive with new information read from a saved game floppy.

@{b}@{u}ANY EXISTING SAVED GAME DATA WILL BE DESTROYED BY THIS PROCEDURE!@{uu}@{ub}

Please read the @{"usage notes" link notes} and @{"known problems" link problems} sections of
this document if you have not done so already. They contain
important information which may help resolve your problem.

If you are using a pirate copy of the game, stop reading now.
I will make no fixes for pirate copies the game. Don`t even ask.

If you are going to send a bug report (email preferred) please
include at least the following information:
- version of the game (eg. 1 MB English Version ECS), number of
  disks etc.

- configuration of your machine including type of Amiga, CPU, CPU
  speed, amount of chip and fast memory, gfx chipset (OCS/ECS/AGA),
  special hardware, kickstart version

- description of what happens eg: error while installing, error while
  starting, gfx errors, keyboard hangs, game crashes on level 15 etc.
  It helps if you describe @{i}exactly@{ui} when the error happens
  and if it happens all the time or just now and again.

@node problems "JWWSInstall - Known problems"
@toc main

The installer is written in as system friendly a way as possible,
but the game is not. Owners of heavily expanded Amigas may have
problems running the game, but this is not the fault of JWWSInstall
and there is little that can be done about it. Try the usual system
degrading tricks if you run into difficulties.

The exit and coredump keys only work in the main game.
