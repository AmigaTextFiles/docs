Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Dangerous Streets" by Flair/Micromania (c) 1993 - 3 disks.
Only AGA version is supported.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7) for run.
Game requires 2.0 MB Chip Mem + AGA chipset (+ 2.7 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Manual protection removed
- OS emulation module used
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

Thanks to Robert Miller for disk images.

This is definitively worst game I've ever seen (and fixed).
