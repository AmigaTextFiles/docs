Short : HD-Installer for Miami Chase V1.0
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Miami Chase" by Code Masters/Team 17 (c) 1990 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.6 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- RNC disk protection removed
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

NOTE:
 If you want to skip title (and I bet you will want ;), hold left mouse button
when game boots.

Thanks to Mark Knibbs for disk images.

Enjoy this first Team 17 Amiga game :)
