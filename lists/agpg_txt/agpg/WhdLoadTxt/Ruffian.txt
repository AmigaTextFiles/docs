	That install applies to "Ruffian" (C) 1996 Ruffian Software.


	That install requires WHDLoad and The Patcher to be in the path.
	Both can be found in the whdload package.


	You need 1 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (68010+ required).


	The diskloader does'nt use checksums over the trackdata, because this
	the procedure of disk image creating may not notice if there are
	read errors on the disk. If you have problems to play the game first
	retry to install and compare the images.


	As a new feature the highscores will be saved now.
