	That patch applies to Jim Power (c) 1992 Loriciel (2 disk version).


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and DIC from the
	whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing Help.


	for problems contact:	mrlarmer@union.org.pl
	full whdload package:	aminet:dev/misc/whdload#?.lha
	other installs:		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload.html


	Thanx to Chris Vella for original disks image and to Harry (you know
	for what ;)
