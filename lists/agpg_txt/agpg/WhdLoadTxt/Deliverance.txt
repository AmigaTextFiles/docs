That patch applies to Deliverance (c) 1993 21. Century.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs The Patcher 1.01 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed: Sound was played slightly false due dbf-delays (THE 
	general soundtracker-problem :(  )

Quit game with F10. This works only ingame - sorry, the
 titlescreen has no keyboardinterrupt allowed.
Trainer: Pressing F9 once causes unlimited lives.
