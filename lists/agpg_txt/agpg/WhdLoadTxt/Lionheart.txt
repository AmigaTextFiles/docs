That patch applies to Lionheart (c) 1993 Thalion.

This install has the slave-version 1.01. It needs WHDLoad 1.98 or higher 
in the path (eg in c:). You need also an installed xfddecrunch-package 
(from /aminet/util/pack/xfd* - this is got to be renamed from time to time,
atm its xfdmaster*).

Fixed:  The program didnt quit correctly.
        Access fault.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes:	That install features the partial-os-emulation by the WEPL/
          Mr.Larmer/me.

The install is tested on a 2 MB A1200 and on an 18 MB 68030. It needs about
1150 k Chip and 500 k other mem, although having at least 4 MB ram is
recommended. Actually, with fewer ram, the loading speed is about the same
like from disk.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
