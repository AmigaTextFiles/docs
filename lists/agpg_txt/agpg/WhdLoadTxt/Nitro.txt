That patch applies to Nitro (c) 1990 Psygnosis, both ntsc and pal-version.

This install has the slave-version 1.13 and the imager-version 1.2.
It needs WHDLoad 1.1 and The Patcher1.05 or higher in the path 
(eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:	Illegal access to $ffdffxxx instead of $dffxxx (therefore
	 the program didnt work at all on 68030+).
	Wrong access to $120xxx instead of $20xxx.
	Illegal access to $ffff8240 and $ff8209 removed.
	Ingame-copyprotection removed.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes: 	The delays in the mainprogram are approx. 10% shorter
	than on the A500, but i think, that doesnt need to be
	fixed.
	No trainer, the game is already too easy (but theres a cheat).
	At ntsc-version, add the tooltype NTSC in the icon.


Thanks to Mr. Larmer for searching that preload-problem.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you
