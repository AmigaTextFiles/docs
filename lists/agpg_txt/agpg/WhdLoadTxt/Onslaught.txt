That patch applies to Onslaught (c) 1989 Hewson.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.03 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:	Diskprotection prevented the game from running on 68060. Removed.
        Stackframe error. (The game ran somehow on my 68030, though, but
         im not sure that it did on all other configurations, so i fixed it).

Quit game with numerical *. Sorry to the A600-owners, but i have my
	original description at home and nearly the whole keyboard
	is used by the game.

Trainer: Numerical / toggles some energy/magic losses.
	Numerical ] sets your energy/magic to the half.
	Gameposition 10 contains after installing a nearly completed game.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Note: I didnt prevent hiscore- and gamepositionsaving this time while
	playing with trainer. I simply think that game is unplayable
	without.

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.
