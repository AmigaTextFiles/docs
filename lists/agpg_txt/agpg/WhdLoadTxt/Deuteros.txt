	That install applies to "Deuteros" © 1991 Ian Bird.
	
	There are at least two different disk versions of the game, directly 
	supported is only one. The second will be converted to the first
	during the install process via WPatch.

	That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.

	You need 1 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").

	This install was very, very much hard work. Many OS functions must be
	emulated (interrupt handling, input.device, trackdisk.device, sprite
	handling...).
	Saving works only if WHDLoad is registered. Access Faults in the intro
	and the middle sequences removed. Some delays inserted. Random
	generator fixed. All reading and write redirected to harddisk.

	if you have problems with this installation please report them via
	the Bug-Report-Form which can be accessed on 
	http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/

	Thanks to Harry for prework on the OSEmu and to Björn Hagström and 
	Oliver Schott for testing.
	Wepl in July, August, October, December 1998 and July 1999.
