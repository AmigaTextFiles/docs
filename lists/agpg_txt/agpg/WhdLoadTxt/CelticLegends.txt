;--- Celtic Legends HD install V1.2

This installer requires the two original Celtic Legends disks.

You have to install WHDLoad first.

V1.2	- Slave now fully pc-relative

V1.1	- Uses 'The Patcher' for image creation

Note that for some unknown reasons the quit option does not work. Maybe some day
WHDLoad will be able to catch this. The default quit key is Numl, but I don't
recommend use.

The decode routine for the imager was written by Harry.

Thanks to Wolfgang Unger who sent me his original.
