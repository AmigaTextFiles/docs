Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), Slipstream

This patch applies to "Insects In Space" by Hewson (c) 1990 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD V10+.
Game requires 0.6 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.6 other memory for preload option)

- Full loading from HD
- RNC disk protection removed (done by Slipstream)
- RNC data decrypted (done by Slipstream)
- Title picture relocated
- ButtonWait tooltype added for title picture
- Trainer key added (pressing F10 will give you 9 lives, F9 = 9 bombs)
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

SOMETHING ABOUT THIS GAME:

This game was originally protected by RNC, loader and data on disks were
completely encrypted. Original was unpatchable (because RNC encryption)
and crack works only on old good A500. In cracked version is original
loader decrypted, so I was able to check parameters. Rest was easy,
'coz rest of data is decrypting when loading, so I used original loader
as part of my ripper.
 Title picture was not visible after some time, 'coz game takes almost
whole 512kb and data overwrited the coperlist with the picture. I fixed it,
now you can watch picture how long you want :)

INSTALL PROCEDURE:

Ripper doesn't work in multitask. Don't panic and wait until ripping/loading
stuff is finished. Created data can be packed with ProPack.

Thanks to Chris Vella for disk image.
