That patch applies to Sentinel (c) 1987 Firebird.

This install has the slave-version 1.00 and the imager-version 1.00.
It needs WHDLoad 0.608 and The Patcher1.05 or higher in the path 
(eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:  Disk system of that game is (was) one single great bug.
        Game used odd-adress error, which failed on 68020+.
        Keyboard interrupt.

Notes:  The icon is a dual romicon/newicon.
        Lets fast remember the keys: a-absorb, sdl,u-movement,
          h-end/fail level, btr-build, q-quit body, <esc>-quit level,
          <cursor left/down>-(un)pause, <f2><f3>-toggle music/sound,
          <space bar>-switch input mode.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you
