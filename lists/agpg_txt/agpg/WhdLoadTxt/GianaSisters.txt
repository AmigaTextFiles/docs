Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:  Gfx-problem with the flame.
	Ask for highscoresave removed, highscore will be always
          saved (except you used the trainer).

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.
Defalt trainer key is numerical ] (quitkey-2). Pressing it toggles the
