That patch applies to Flip-it & Magnose (c) 1989 Expanding Minds/
Mirrorsoft.

This install has the slave-version 1.00 and the parameter-version 1.00.
It needs WHDLoad 0.608 and The Patcher1.05 or higher in the path 
(eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:  Some dbf-delays (affecting sound and keyboard).
        It used no checksum over its disk data so i added one. Contact
          me if you have imaging problems.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
