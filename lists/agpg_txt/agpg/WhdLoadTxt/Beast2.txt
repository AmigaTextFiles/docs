	That patch applies to Shadow Of The Beast 2 (c) 1992 Psygnosis (2 disk version).


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and Patcher from
	the whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F9.


	for problems contact:	mrlarmer@union.art.pl
	full whdload package:	aminet:dev/misc/whdload#?.lha
	other installs:		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/

	So, I find 39 blitter wait errors and now game works fine (PAL).
	NTSC version not used blitter waits function. I changed it.

	If screen flashed when intro is executed use NOMMU tooltype.

	New features:
	- skip intro by left mouse button,
	- skip text screens in intro by right mouse button,
	- checksums removed,
	- imager calculate checksums for every tracks,
	- faster decrunching files in game (fast ram used),
	- only WHDLoad newer than 0.608 must be used.

	Thanx to Michael Freundt for original disk image (PAL) and
	to Chris Vella for original disk image (NTSC), too.
