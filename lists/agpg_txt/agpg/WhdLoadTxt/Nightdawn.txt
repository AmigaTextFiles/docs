That patch applies to Nightdawn (c) 1989 Magic Bytes, pal- and ntsc-version.

That install needs WHDLoad 0.608 and The Patcher 1.05 or higher in the 
path (eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
expert as installation mode.

Fixed:	Copyprotection crashed. Removed.
	Crash and access fault in the sound replay.
        Problem with trainerkey under WHDLoad 1.92+ corrected.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.
Default trainer key is ] (Quitkey-2). Pressing it will toggle the life loss.

Note:   At the ntsc-version i recommend to set the tooltype NTSC.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
         use them wholly on your own risk.
