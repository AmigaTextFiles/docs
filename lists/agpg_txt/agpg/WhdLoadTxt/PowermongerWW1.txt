	That install applies to "Powermonger World War 1" © 1991 Bullfrog.


	That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the whdload package.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing ESC or F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=")


	Manual protection has been removed. Three Access Faults fixed. Savegame
	redirected to harddisk. Keyboard routine fixed. Request for original
	Powermonger disk removed.
	

	To extract your savegames from a floppy :
		create a disk image using DIC from your savegame disk
		enter the directory where "Disk.1" is stored, and
		execute "sgsaverww1", all valid savegames are extracted,
		move them now to the PowerMongerWW1 save directory ...


	Thanx to Wolfgang Unger for media support.
