	That install applies to "Moonstone" © 1991 Mindscape.

	That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
	the WHDLoad package.

	You need 1 MB ChipMem and 1 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").

	Features:
	 - synchronization added
	 - various access faults and bugs removed
	 - keyboard handling fixed
	 - sound play fixed
	 - delays inserted
	 - intro skip (press ESC) added
	 - 150 gold cash limit removed (now 999)
	 - ssp moved to fast mem
	 - decruncher relocated and optimized
	 - protection removed
	 - to save diskspace all files inside the "data" directory can be
	   compressed using FImp or ProPack, anyway sense does it make only
	   for the files "mog" and "program" because the other files are
	   already compressed with a custom compressor
	 - setting the Tooltype "ButtonWait" inserts a delay in the info
	   screen before a battle starts, this allows the reading of the
	   info text which sometimes contain valuable informations

	a cheat has been also added, anyway the game is not that hard and can
	be completed without, the word to activate the cheat is contained in
	this document...

	if you have problems with this installation please try first to get
	a newer version of this install from
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
	if that doesn't help try some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC,
	NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. if that also doesn't help inform the
	author via the Bug-Report-Form which can be accessed on
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
