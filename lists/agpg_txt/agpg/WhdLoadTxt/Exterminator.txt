Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Exterminator" by Audiogenic/Assembly Line (c) 1990 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7.0) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.9 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Disk protection removed
- ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (your default key)

HISTORY:

V1.0 (17-Dec-1998) - first public release
V1.1 (28-Apr-1999) - slave optimized ;)
                   - less memory consumation
                   - better icon

Thanks to Chris Vella for disk image and betatesting.
