GAMMA CORRECTION OPTION (Out of the dark)

 Well, you probably noticed game is quite dark. I'm not sure if it was
same case on A500, but no need to care now! I improved ingame routine
for setting the palette colours. You can control brightness level with CUSTOM2
tooltype. There are examples:
CUSTOM2=0      don't change the colors
CUSTOM2=$111   raise color value +1
CUSTOM2=$333   raise color value +3 (optional brightness for me)
CUSTOM2=$999   aaaah! high radiation level ;)
Don't forget '$' before value and don't forget to write it 3x. Enjoy :)


Thanks to Helmut Motzkau and to Carlo Pirri for disk images.
