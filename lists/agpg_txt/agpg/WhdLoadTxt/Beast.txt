That patch applies to Shadow of the Beast 1 (c) 1989 Psygnosis. 2 versions
supported.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.02 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Protectioncheck caused a stackframe error.

Quit game with F10.

Toggle energytrainer with F1 on/off. No complete trainer, its senseless:
if you hang in an abyss you couldnt get out.

Comment: That was a funny one with 2 ingameprotectionchecks and 
	 5 memorychecksums, also in the interrupt. Enjoy this graphical
	 wonder of Psygnosis!

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.
