That patch applies to Gauntlet 3 (c) 1991 Tengen/U.S. Gold.

That install needs WHDLoad 0.608 or higher in the path (eg in c:). 

Fixed:  Interruptstatus corrected.
        Lots of blitwaits inserted.
	3 access faults removed.
        Possible crash in the soundsystem fixed.
        Wrap of your energy from 9999 to 0 prevented, energy is now
          limited to 9800.
        Decruncher moved to fastmem, since the game loads often.
        Codeprotection removed, the charset is that strange and my 
          codewheel is that badly assembled that i managed it only 
          every 3rd start to enter the correct codes.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes:  There are many defective disks out there, so i included the
          correct files in the install itself (it took me about 1 year
          to get a correct version).

Comments: That one really needed a hdinstall, it took ages to load and
          decrunch. Now it loads a level in 3 secs instead of 50.
        Its one of the best games of U.S. Gold and i am a labyrinthgame-
          addicted, so i couldnt other than fix it.
        I recommend to play with neptune, he has the most shotpower.
        I also recommend to have at least 4 MB ram so the install can
          preload all files, else youll have hours of loading time.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
