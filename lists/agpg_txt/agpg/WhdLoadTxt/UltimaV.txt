;--- Ultima V HD install V1.2

This installer requires the two original Ultima V disks.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

If you get read errors while installing try another device than df0:

V1.2	- Slave now fully pc-relative
	- Exit key changed to Numl

V1.1	- Keyboard handling rewritten
	- Removed a bug in the character creation (the game crashed when

Thanks to Wolfgang 'Ungi' Unger for sending me his original.
