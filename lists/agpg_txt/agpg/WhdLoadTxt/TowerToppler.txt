	That install applies to "Tower Toppler" (C) 1987/88 Hewson.


	That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
	the whdload package.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10.
	
	
	A really nice game in my opinion. And this in the year of 1988!
	As a new feature the highscore will be saved now.
	To save diskspace you can pack the "#?.pic" and "toppler.code" files
	with ProPack or FImp.
