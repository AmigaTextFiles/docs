That patch applies to Wrath of the Demon (c) 1990 Readysoft.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Some access faults. (I guess the game ran not reliable at an A4000).

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.
Default trainer key is numerical ] (quitkey-2 in the keytable).
Pressing the trainer key gives full energy.
Once you used the trainer the program will not save the gameposition this
runtime anymore.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.
