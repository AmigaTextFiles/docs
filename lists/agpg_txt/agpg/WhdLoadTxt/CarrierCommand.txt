;--- Carrier Command HD install V1.3

This installer requires the File 'Carrier' from the dual game disk released by
Kixx (length should be 188240 bytes). It was written for Microprose Version
13/08/90. Press Ctrl+V while playing for version number. If you have an
unsupported versioncontact me. 

You have to install WHDLoad first.

V1.3	- Exit key changed to Numl

You have to copy the required file by hand! The installer will create an empty
image called Disk.1 where the saved games are stored. Run it once to get this
file or again to erase stored data. Note that installers for other versions of
Carrier Command use Disk.3 to store data, so don't mix them up!

Due to the fact that this version came along with the one for PCs they have
removed the nice sample that is played after waiting some minutes on the title
screen. Anyway the load & playroutines were still operating, so I had to
disable them. If you come across the sample (original release tracks 0-79,
upper side) save it as Disk.2 in the Carrier directory. The file should have
a length of 409600 bytes. Press F1 on selection screen to listen to the title
music. If the file is not present, someone will tell you so.  ;)

Thanks to Carlo Pirri for sending his disk across the planet! Nice stamps.  ;)
Also greetings to Andre Kutterer for his version.

;--- Carrier Command HD install V1.3

This installer requires the original Carrier Command disk. It was written for
Release Version A1.2 19/08/88. Press Ctrl+V while playing for version number.
If you have an unsupported version contact me.

You have to install WHDLoad first.

Insert the original disk in df0: and wait for your drive to find the disk.
Then double click the install icon.

Press F1 on selection screen to listen to the title music.

V1.3	- Slave now fully pc-relative
	- Exit key changed to Numl

V1.2	- Access fault removed, thanks to Carlo Pirri for report.

V1.1	- Installs and plays now all 80 tracks of the sample instead of only 40.
	  Thanks to Mark for his clue. My disk had a read error and stopped
	  after 40 tracks what I thought to be normal.
