Short : HD-Installer for Narc V1.0
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Narc" by Ocean (c) 1990 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.9 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- RNC disk protection removed
- BUTTONWAIT tooltype added for title picture and music
- Trainer option (CUSTOM1 tooltype)
- Ammo key option (CUSTOM2 tooltype)
- CPU dependant loops fixed
- Blitter waits inserted (17x)
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

ABOUT TRAINER:
 If you will set CUSTOM1=1, you have unlimited energy and credits. CUSTOM2=1
will set ammo key. It means, you can press F5 at anytime (in game) and all ammo
will be set on maximum value. New ammo state will be displayed after one shot,
so don't panic.

Thanks to Riccardo Cretti for disk image!

Let's have fun now!
