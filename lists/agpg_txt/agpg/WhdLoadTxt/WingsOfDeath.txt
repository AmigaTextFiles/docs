That patch applies to Wings of Death (c) 1990 Thalion.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  The game tried to switch to NTSC in a strange way, causing
         display problems on AGA.
	Soundeffects and Title music were played wrong.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Cheat mode: Type spellbinder in the title screen. Now F1-F10 and 
             1-5 select various stuff. I prevented the scoresave
             if you have/had the cheat mode active, so if you play
             for highscores, you have to do it without cheat mode.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
         use them wholly on your own risk.
