	That patch applies to Second Samurai AGA and ECS (c) 1993 Psygnosis
	(3 disk version).


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and DIC from the
	whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.


	You need 2.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem for AGA version.
	You need 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem for ECS version.
	You need AGA chipset for AGA version.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10.

	full whdload package:	aminet:dev/misc/whdload#?.lha

	Thanx to Chris Vella for original disk images (AGA) and to Dom Miller
	for original disk images (ECS), too.

	Samples not playing correctly.
	Use tooltype NoMMU in ECS version, because some access fault I can't
	removed.
