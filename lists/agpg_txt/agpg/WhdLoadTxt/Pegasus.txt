;--- Pegasus HD install [registered users only]

This installer requires the two original Pegasus disks.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

If you have not yet registered WHDLoad, this patch will NOT work. You will return
to the workbench right after the title picture.

Thanks to Wolfgang Unger for sending me his original.
