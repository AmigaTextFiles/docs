	That install applies to "Total Carnage" © 1994 ICE.


	That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
	the WHDLoad package.


	You need 2.0 MB ChipMem and 2.0 MB OtherMem.
	You need AGA chipset and at least a 68020 processor.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").


	Highscores will be saved to HD.


	Currently only the plain AGA version is supported, if anyone has
	got the CD32 version I would be pleased.


	1.1 - Support for the Computer Combat Pack version

	1.0 - Initial release
