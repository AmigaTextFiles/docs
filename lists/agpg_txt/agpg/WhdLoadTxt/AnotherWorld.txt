That patch applies to Another World (c) 1991 Delphine Software.

That install needs WHDLoad 1.1 and The Patcher 1.00 or higher 
in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Sound is now played properly.
        Codeprotection is set out of function - just press ok.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Comment: This is the first install featuring the Partial-OS-Emulation-module
          allowing some uncomplicated things like clean quit and no
          problems with display-degrading.
        I strongly recommend to have at least 3 MB ram, else its not
          very useful due the many os-switches. But if you have fewer
          ram you may run it without WHDLoad, just start it with 'another'
          (but then, of course, you have no degrading or sound fixed).

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
