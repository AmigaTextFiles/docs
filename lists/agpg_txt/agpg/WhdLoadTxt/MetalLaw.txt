That patch applies to Metal Law (c) 1992 New Bits on the Ram.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Keyboard works now on faster processors.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
