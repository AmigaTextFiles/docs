	That install applies to "Mego lo mania" (C) 1991 Mirrorsoft, Sensible
	Software.

	That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
	the whdload package.

	You need 1 MB ChipMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (change key with tooltype
	QuitKey=..)

	this install is tested on the english, france and german
	game version, and shoud work on all of them

	the game uses cia timers in runmode which can make problems
	if not all files are preloaded, if you get an black screen
	and the game doesnt continue press F1, this will restart the
	cia-a timers and will hopefully help
	
	if you have enough ram the installation should work properly

	for problems contact me at: jah@fh-zwickau.de
