That patch applies to TwinWorld (c) 1989 Blue Byte/UBI Soft.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.03 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Wrong interrupthandling prevented the game from running.

Quit game with F10.

Trainer: F9 sets your lives to 9. F8 sets your red balls to 80. Once you
         used the trainer the program will not save highscores this
         run-time anymore.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.
