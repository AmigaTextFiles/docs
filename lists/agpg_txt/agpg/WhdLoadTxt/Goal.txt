	That patch applies to Goal (c) 1993 Virgin (2 disk version).


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and DIC from the
	whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.


	You need 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10.


	for problems contact:	mrlarmer@union.medianet.pl
	full whdload package:	aminet:dev/misc/whdload#?.lha
	other installs:		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload.html

	Thanx to Jan Pedro Tumusok for original disks image (v1.1) and
	to Carsten Wich for original disks image (v1.0), too.

	Load action replays not working correctly, because I wrong simulate
	'disk changed'.

	Use DIC program by hand to create files 'Disk.3' (disk with settings)
	and 'Disk.4' (disk with action replays).
