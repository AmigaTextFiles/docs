	That patch applies to Surf Ninjas (c) 1994 Creative Edge (2 disk version).


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and Patcher from
	the whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.


	You need 2.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You need AGA chipset.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10.
