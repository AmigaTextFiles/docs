That patch applies to Crazy Cars 3 (c) 1992 Titus.

This install has the slave-version 2.02 and the parameter-version 1.00.
It needs WHDLoad 1.98 and The Patcher1.00 or higher in the path 
(eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:  The program used unallocated memory, making a normal install
          under the OS unreliable. This is now circumvented.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes:	That install features the partial-os-emulation by the WEPL/
          Mr.Larmer/me.
        League result will always be saved (since the disks are marked
          as inserted). But you may backup the file "nmdat" to have 
          your state preserved.
        The icon is a dual romicon/newicon.

Known bugs: Drive-led is still lit. Ill fix that later.

The install is tested with 2 MB and PRELOAD on an A1200. It needs about
830 k Chip and 500 k other mem, although having at least 3 MB ram is
recommended. Actually, with fewer ram, it loads slower than from disk.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
