;--- Conqueror HD install V1.1

This installer requires an original Conqueror disk. It supports two versions -
the original release and the version from the Rainbow Arts 'Mega Box'
compilation. If you have an unsupported version contact me.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

Insert the original disk in df0: and wait for your drive to find the disk. Then
double click on the install icon.

Thanks to Carlo Pirri for his image.
