Short : HD-Installer for Plotting V1.1
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Plotting" by Ocean (c) 1990 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V8+) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.4 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Disk protection removed
- BUTTONWAIT tooltype added
- NI/MWB icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

Thanks to Lempkee for disk image.

Note:
  This install doesn't emulate disk access in Construction Kit Editor. Use
any DOS disk for saving your designed data. If there will be any requests,
I will work on load/save emulation for editor too.
