;--- Battle Squadron HD install V1.4

This installer requires the original Battle Squadron disk. It supports both
PAL and NTSC version.

You have to install WHDLoad first.

V1.4    - Slave now fully pc-relative
	- Exit key changed to Numl

V1.3	- Bugfix in NTSC Highscore saving

V1.2	- NTSC version support
	- Uses 'The Patcher' for file creation
	- Highscore saving added [registered users only]

I set the number of players to default one. No big deal, I just wanted to
mention it.  ;)

Cheat: Typing CASTOR while playing will cause the screen to flash green. Now
you are immortal and can use F1-F10 for weapon selection.

Thanks to Sophocles Metsis for sending me the NTSC version & bug report.

Turn your stereo to maximum volume while playing and get the real arcade
feeling with this great game from 1989!
