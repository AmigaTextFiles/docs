This patch applies to "Pitfighter" by Domark/Teque (c) 1991 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.8 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- 2 versions supported
- RNC disk protection removed (in Condor's version)
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

Thanks to Chris Vella and to Condor for disk images.

Enjoy (!?!).
