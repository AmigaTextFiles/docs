That patch applies to Atomix (c) 1990 Thalion.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Keyboard interrupts. Now you can leave the pause mode on 68020+.
        Highscoreentries are now always possible if your score was good
          enough (sometimes the game ignored your score).
        Some blitwaits inserted.
        Sound replay fixed.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

NOTE:   That game loaded its data without a checksum, i added a checksum
          on the imaging (except for the highscore track). Hope it works
          for you too.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
         use them wholly on your own risk.
