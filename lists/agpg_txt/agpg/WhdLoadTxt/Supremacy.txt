This installer requires the two original Supremacy disks.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

If you have not yet registered WHDLoad, this patch will NOT work. You will return
to the workbench right after the intro.

V1.1	- Game bug removed, troop screen displayed wrong cargo bay content.
	  Thanks to Roderick Mouthaan for report.

Thanks to Wolfgang Unger for sending me his original and to Tony McGarry for beta
testing. Greetings to Morbidus who first started working on Supremacy.
