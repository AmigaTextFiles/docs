Short : HD-Installer for Global Gladiators V1.0 (16-Dec-1998)
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Global Gladiators" by Virgin (c) 1993 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7.0) for run.
Game requires 1.0 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.8 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Disk protection removed
- 24bit access fault fixed
- NI/MWB icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (your default key)

Notes:
 Aaargh. Finally finished. This one was tough (for me). Lot of problems.
It was finished because luck. I removed protection, partially emulated
loader, but game has still problems. Then I looked at my game archive
and I unpacked Cool Spot. When I looked inside (I wanted to rip off modules
first ;), I noticed that game launcher is exactly same like in G.G.
I fixed my loader and it worked fine! Just one 24bit fix and it was done :)
 Enjoy or die! BTW, game uses same protection,loader,memory allocation,packer,
like in Cool Spot and Apocalypse.


Thanks goes to: - Chris Vella for disk image, beta testing, support.
