Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Crime Wave" by US Gold (c) 1990 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V10+) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.4 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD (no more problems with A500 only bootblock loaders ;-)
- Manual protection removed
- Trainer option added (set CUSTOM1=1 for unlimited lives and some weapons)
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

Thanks to Carlo Pirri for disk images.
