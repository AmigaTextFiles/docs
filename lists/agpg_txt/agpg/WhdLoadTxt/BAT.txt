;--- B.A.T. HD install V1.2

This installer requires the two original B.A.T. disks. It supports both
German and English version. If you have an unsupported one contact me.

You have to install WHDLoad first.

V1.2    - Slave now fully pc-relative
	- Exit key changed to Numl

V1.1	- Uses 'The Patcher' for image creation
	- Support for English version added
	- Another disk check removed
	- Save option for registered users only

When the game asks you to insert disk two simply press left mouse to go. I did
not remove this routine because I like the sample that is played. The other
disk requesters remained as well because if one image gets damaged, the game
will hang with a 'Insert Disk x' requester. At least you know then which image
is the faulty one. If it ever happens then only to disk.3 - the storage disk -
I think. This is exactly the way the original behaves, so don't blame me.

No matter what the game will tell you, all disk operations, including format,
are performed to the correct image on HD.

Thanks to Angus Manwaring for sending me the English version.
