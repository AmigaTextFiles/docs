Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Deep Space" by Psygnosis (c) 1986 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7) for run.
Game requires 0.6 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.7 other memory for preload option)
Install requires RawDIC in path.

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- ButtonWait tooltype added (for Psygnosis logo, credits and title picture)
- Sound fixed
- Fixed unfriendly $DFFxxx access
- Saves to HD
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

NOTES:
 Savegame is stored in "savegame.dat" file, you can save only 1x savegame
(as it was in original game).

V1.0 (19-Aug-1999) - first public release
V1.1 (02-Sep-1999) - RawDIC imager improved. Now it doesn't ask for disk 2.
                     You don't need to reinstall. Thanks to Graham for help ;)

Thanks to Mark Knibbs for disk image and to Graham for help with imager.
