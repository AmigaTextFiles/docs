That patch applies to Killing Game Show (c) 1990 Psygnosis.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.03 in the path (eg in c:).

Defaultkeys:
Quit game with numerical *.

Trainer: Numerical ] toggles energy losses.
	 Numerical [ lets choose you between all stages (press this before
           accessing the stage-menu).
         Numerical / toggles water rising.
IMPORTANT NOTE! If you take too long to solve a level with water-trainer, 
         teleporters/chainholders will vanish. This results from the replay-
         feature which overwrites then some memory which couldnt be reached 
         in normal mode because you would die earlier. I couldnt fix this 
         until now. So use the watertrainer to get a general look of that
         level and try to solve it then with the energytrainer only.
         Level 1 and 8 dont contain teleporters nor chainholders.

You may change the keys to another value with QUITKEY= in the icon, then 
they are ordered descendend in the keytable (eg if you set QUITKEY=$0A,
7,8,9 is trainer, 0 quits).


The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Note:    Once you used the trainer the program will not save highscores 
         this run-time anymore.

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.
