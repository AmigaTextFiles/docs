Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Vital Light" by Millenium/Effective Chaos (c) 1994 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7) for run.
Game requires 1.0 MB Chip Mem + (+ 2.1 other memory for preload option)
Install requires RawDIC and XFDDecrunch utility in path.

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- OS emulation module used
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

ABOUT THE INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:
- xfdDecrunch is used for unpacking of executable file
- game is NDOS, but slave will not use diskimages - RawDIC is used for
  custom directory ripping.

Thanks to - Chris Vella for disk images
          - John Selck for great RawDIC

Enjoy this great logical game!!
