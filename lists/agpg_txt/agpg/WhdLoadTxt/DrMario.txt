That patch applies to Dr. Mario by Trash Danmark in 1992.

This install has the slave-version 1.00.
It needs WHDLoad 0.608 or higher in the path (eg in c:). 

Fixed:  About every 10th loading the game didnt appear. This is now 
          corrected.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION:
        You can get the full game from aminet:game/jump/drmario.lha ,
          decrunch it to that directory here. Then copy the whole
          directory to whereever you want on your hd.

The install is tested with on a 2 MB A1200 and on an 18 MB 68030. 

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
