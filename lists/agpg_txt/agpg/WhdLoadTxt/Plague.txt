	That patch applies to The Plague (c) 1990 Innerprise Software
	(2 disk version).


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad and Patcher from
	the whdload package. The tools must be available via the path.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10.


	for problems contact:	mrlarmer@union.medianet.pl
	full whdload package:	aminet:dev/misc/whdload#?.lha
	other installs:		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload.html

	Fixed: lots blitter waits added, few access fault removed.

	Thanx to Chris Vella for original disk images and many thanx to
	Harry for help with disk imager (that was very hard work).
