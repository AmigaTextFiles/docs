This patch applies to "Carl Lewis Challenge" by Psygnosis/Teque (c) 1992 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.8 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Load/Save teams redirected to HD
- RNC disk protection removed
- Copperlist error fixed (by Dark Angel)
- ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

NOTE:
If you want to use savedisk (not necessary if you want to play arcade), use
separated install script. "Disk.3" file will be created and used by the game.
Install_Savedisk script is used for creating empty savedisk too.

Thanks to Chris Vella for disk images and to Dark Angel for big help with gfx error!!!
