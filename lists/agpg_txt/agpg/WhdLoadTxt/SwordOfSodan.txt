That patch applies to Sword of Sodan (c) 1988 Discovery International.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:	Access fault.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.
Default trainer key is ]. Pressing it will give you 5 lives.

NOTES:	Once you used the trainer the game wont save the highscores this
          runtime anymore.
	Hold firebutton down at starting to see the production scrolltext 
	  of disk 3.
	Due the very special diskformat its possible that you have a 
          different version if only one track is unreadable. Contact me
          in that case.
	The imager is a bit slow, so be patient.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
         use them wholly on your own risk.
