That patch applies to Gauntlet 2 (c) 1986/1988 Atari/US Gold, and the
rerelease by Mindscape.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs The Patcher 1.01 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed: Diskroutine didnt work entirely reliable due dbf-delays 
	(now obsolete :) ).
       Manualprotection of the Mindscapeversion removed.

Quit game with F10.
Trainer: F6-F9 adds some food to player 1-4.
