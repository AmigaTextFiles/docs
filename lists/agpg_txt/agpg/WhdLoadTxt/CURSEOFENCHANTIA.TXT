Short : HD-Installer for Curse of Enchantia V1.0 (13-Jan-1999)
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Curse of Enchantia" by Core Design (c) 1992 - 6 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7) for run.
Game requires 1.0 MB Chip Mem (+ 4.5 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:
- Full load from HD
- Load/Save redirected to HD
- RNC disk protection removed
- RNC decruncher relocated to Fast RAM
- Fixed access faults (4x)
- NI/MWB icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

NOTE ABOUT LOAD/SAVE:

Savedisk image will be created by install script. It will create 196 kB long
file named 'Disk.2'. Use format option in-game before using load/save.
 Tooltype CUSTOM1=1 will switch load/save from floppy, so you can play from
your old positions on floppy. (It will also save 196 kB of your HD/memory space
because you don't need file 'Disk.2' anymore. CUSTOM1=0 will use savedisk image
(so no floppy access ;)
 If you want to transfer your old saves from floppy to hd, write this:
'DIC FD=2 LD=2 SIZE=195584' in CLI and copy file 'Disk.2' created in RAM: to your
'Curse of Enchantia/data' directory.

NOTE ABOUT INSTALL PROCEDURE:

Game data are stored this way: disk #1 is nonDOS, other disks got files.
I decided to rip used tracks from 1st disk and save them as files. Install
will create disk 1 image, then screen will go black until ripping all files.
Other disks are installed by normal way. Disk 1 is protected on first sectors,
so don't panic when you'll see sector error message.
 Install script uses only DF0: (internal drive), sorry.

Thanks to Jean-Francois Fabre for disk images and beta testing.

Enjoy this REAL classic!
