	Obliterator (Psygnosis/1988) HD Fix by Tue Brisson Morbidus


	Before you can use this you must install WHDLoad 
	from the whdload package.
	The tool must be available via the path.


	Required memory:	0.5 MB ChipMem
				0.5 MB FastMem

	To quit press:		F10
	Trainer on/off:		F8


	NOTES:
	Finally you can play this ancient game on your hd! :]

	Save/load game fully implemented. If no valid save-file exists,
	it will try to load directly from the diskimage.

	The trainer will give you unlimited energy, ammo & time(score).
	It is connected to the keyinterrupt, so it will only be updated 
	every time you press a key.

	This slave will probably need WHDLoad version 0.607 or higher.
	If you don't use PRELOAD, it will load slower than the original.

	This release was delayed because I fucked up with the imager &
	I only found the bug after a long time. (Too long!)



	BUGS:
	The animated intro doesn't display quite the way it should.
	If anybody knows how to fix this, then mail me so I can implement it
	in the slave.

	The imager can only read from df0:
