That patch applies to Cytron (c) 1992 Psygnosis, both PAL and NTSC-version.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs The Patcher 1.02 in the path (eg in c:).

Preferences to quit game set to numerical * (feel free to change that in
the icon).

Trainer: 1 increases Cyts energy, 2 Rons energy and 3 the Depots energy.
	 One password is BFDG.

Notes: 	 Due a disk routine in the interrupt that was hard work for me.
         You may set the tooltype NTSC at the NTSC-version, but please
           dont try this with the PAL-version.

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.
