Short : HD-Installer for Charlie J. Cool V1.1
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Charlie J. Cool" by Nevada (c) 1996 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7.0) for run.
AGA version requires 2.0 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.8 other memory for preload option).
ECS version requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.8 other memory for preload option).

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- 2 versions are supported (AGA, ECS)
- NI/MWB icon (ripped by Midwik, created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

HISTORY:

V1.0 (03-Dec-1998)  - first public release
V1.1 (30-Apr-1999)  - ECS version supported, use corresponding install script
     * AGA version: - slave optimized
                    - quit key now works everywhere (NoDivZero flag ;)
                    - Power Packer decruncher removed from slave (too slow anyway)
     
Thanks to - Chris Vella for disk images of AGA version
          - JHZ for disk images of ECS version (and for icons ;)
