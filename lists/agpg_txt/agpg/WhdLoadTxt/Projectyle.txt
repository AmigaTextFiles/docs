That patch applies to Projectyle (c) 1990 Eldritch the Cat/Electronic Arts.

This install has the slave-version 1.11 and the imager-version 1.01.
It needs WHDLoad 1.1 and The Patcher1.05 or higher in the path 
(eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:  Protectioncheck used all kinds of 68000-only programming. Removed.
        About 180 (!!) blitwaits inserted (with an automatical replacer).

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes:	That fix is 68020+ only. The blitwaits slow the program down,
	  so it isnt playable anymore on the 68000. I think the 68000-
          times are gone.
	Please dont change the gamepositiondrive from DF2: to DF0: at the 
          prefs. You will only be able to save gamepositions to that 
          (virtual) DF2: (but its ofcourse really your hd).
        I strongly recomment that you try to free as much as possible
          memory on a plain A1200 so the install can preload the disk.
          Otherwise youll have tenth the loading time.
	You can set the preferences with CUSTOM2 (make a coredump with
          debug and get the value from address $4ca3c in the dump).

Enhanced: Another type of 4-player-adapter is supported with CUSTOM1=1.

Comment: That game needed really a hd-install. It took hours to load.

The install is tested with 2 MB and PRELOAD on an A1200.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
