Author : Bored Seal (cossick@email.cz), ICQ:21086453

This patch applies to "Outrun Europe" by US Gold/Probe (c) 1991 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V7.0) for run.
Game requires 1.0 MB Chip Mem (+ 1.8 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- Disk protection removed
- Access fault in music routine fixed
- NI/MWB icon (created by JHZ, ripped by Midwik)
- Quit option (your default key)

Cheat (taken from Sweet Cheater):
  Pause the game with CTRL and type 'ORINJ'. Now you can skip levels with
Help and raise time with cursor up.

Thanks to Chris Vella for disk images.

Enjoy another US Gold game on your hd :)
