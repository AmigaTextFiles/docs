This patch applies to "Violator" by Code Masters (c) 1991 - 1 disk.
Slave requires WHDLOAD (at least V10+) for run.
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem (+ 0.9 other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:

- Full load from HD
- RNC disk protection removed
- Blitter waits inserted (23x)
- BUTTONWAIT tooltype added for title picture
- Trainer key option
- ROM/NI icon (ripped by Midwik, created by JHZ)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

ABOUT TRAINER:
  If tooltype CUSTOM1=1 is set,every F6 key pressing will give you 9 lives.

Big thanks to Skreen for disk image and to Condor for digging Codemasters games
for me :-).
