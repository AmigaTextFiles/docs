;--- Utopia HD install V1.1 [registered users only]

This installer requires the two original Utopia disks. It supports both V1.0 and
V3.0 of the game. You will be asked whether you want to have your New Worlds
data disk installed.

You have to install WHDLoad first.

You need 1MB chip.

V1.1	- Support for V1.0 added, thanks to Joona Palaste for his original
	- Support for New Worlds data disk added, also provided by Joona Palaste

V1.0	- First release, thanks to Lars Olsson for his original V3.0

In order to be able to use you data disk enable the Custom1 tooltype.

If you have not yet registered WHDLoad, this patch will NOT work. You will return
to the workbench right after the intro.

Don't forget to 'format' your save disk.
