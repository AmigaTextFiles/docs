That patch applies to Thunderhawk (c) 1992 Core design, german and
english version.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Program runs now with enabled caches (a really improvement, its
          now smooooth!).
        Sound replay.
        Crash while interpreting a mission text (german version).
        Access faults.
        Code protection removed (sometimes you had to enter nonexisting 
          words, sometimes it even crashed).

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Note:   You can now skip the intro with holding the mousebutton at start,
          but then you cant enter a name. So start the program the first
          time normally and save your gameposition.

Comment: It is the best flightsim ever, so it was really worth to install 
          it. Not too difficult, and nearly no fiddling with the keyboard.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
