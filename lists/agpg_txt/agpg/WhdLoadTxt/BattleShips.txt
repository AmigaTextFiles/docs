That fix applies to BattleShips (C) 1987 Elite, version with speech.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.02 in the path (eg in c:).
The Patcher can be obtained from the WHDLoad-package.

Quit game with F6.

Fixed: The loading routine of that game is one single great bug. They
        did load their stuff without a check, i use my own routine 
        with checksums that apply to my disk while patching. I tested my 
        imagecreation on 3 different drives, everytime with the same 
        loading-result and so i maked checksums from that image. Hope it 
        works for you too.
       Dbf-delays replaced.

The game should run with 1 MB memory without starting the 
workbench, its tested with 2 MB ram.
