That patch applies to Hunter (c) 1990 Activision, english and german 
version.

This install has the slave-version 1.21 and the imager-version 1.0.
It needs WHDLoad 1.1 and The Patcher1.05 or higher in the path 
(eg in c:). To install from a different drive than df0: select
Expert as installation mode.

Fixed:  Gameencryption used many kind of 68000-only programming. Rewritten
          for 680x0.
        Some dbf-delays replaced.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Known bug: Demo doesnt work correctly. I tried already 6 h to fix it,
          but couldnt manage it. Its simply that all events are
          recorded timedependend, and on faster cpus the playing speed
          is different.

Note:   Dont forget to 'format' your gamepositionfile on hd before the first 
          save of a position.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.
