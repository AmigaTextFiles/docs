;--- Stormball HD install V1.1

This installer requires the original Stormball disk.

You have to install WHDLoad first.

V1.1	- Uses 'The Patcher' for image creation
	- Exit key changed to Numl

The game slave tries to enable the caches. The tooltype NOCACHE (which is set
by default) overrides this behaviour. Unsetting the NOCACHE tooltype will
result in a mayor speedup and sometimes funny samples. So it is up to you to
find out what you prefer...
