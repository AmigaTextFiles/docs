;--- Stryx HD install [registered users only]

This installer requires the two original Stryx disks.
You have to install WHDLoad first.

If you have not yet registered WHDLoad, this patch will NOT work. You will return
to the workbench right after the intro. As long as there are only a handful of
registrations while the download counters grow week by week I will stop making
patches only limited in saving to HD.

Thanks to Dark Ness for sending me his original.
