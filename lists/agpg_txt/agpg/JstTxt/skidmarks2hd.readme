Short : HD-Installer for Skidmarks 2
Type : game/patch
Author : Acid Software
Uploader : Jean-François Fabre (jffabre@free.fr)

Well, I found this HD install for Skidmarks 2 on the Acid Software ftp
site 3 years ago, and it was on my WWW page as DMS archive. Due to space
considerations, I cannot afford to keep it on my WWW, so I converted the
archive to lha and uploaded it on aminet.
