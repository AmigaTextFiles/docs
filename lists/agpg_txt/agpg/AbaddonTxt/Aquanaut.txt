Short:	 	HD Installer for Aquanaut v1.1

Type:	 	game/patch

This installer requires the original Aquanaut by F1 Licenceware.

Features:

- Added support for a 2nd version (Amiga Format CD #18)
- Loaders for both WHDLoad and JST
- Quit key <HELP> (Variable with WHDLoad)
- High scores saved on exit for JST and
  after new score entered for WHDLoad.

The Amiga Format version never worked for me from disk.  Seems that when they updated
the docs on the disk it corrupted the 1st loader and the 1st 2 intro pics.  The game
is still fully intact though.

This installer is NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE and may not be included on any
CD compilation without my written permission.  The only exception to this
is Aminet.
