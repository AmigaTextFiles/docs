This installer requires the original Wreckers disk by Audiogenic
Software.

Thanks to Carlo Pirri for the original.

Features:

- JST and WHDLoad loaders
- Fixed illegal adressing errors
- Full loading of the game from HD
- Uses JST to run (get it on aminet)
- Possible quit with F10 key
- Saving of high scores to HD
- Saving of game to HD
- Iconify/Snapshot with <TAB> (JST)

The JST version does not work correctly with the 060.  The WHDLoad version works
fine on all.

NOTE:

To save your game or high scores for the 1st time you must use
the Format save game disk 1st.  This will create a file on your HD
which is used for a savegame index.  Once this is done you can save
your game and/or high scores to the HD.
