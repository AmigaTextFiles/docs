This installer requires the original The Eye of Horus disk from Britanica
Software.

Thanks to Achim Breﬂ for the 2nd version.

Features:

- Both JST and WHDLoad loaders.
- Supports Iconify/Snapshot with "TAB' key (JST)
- Press 'F10' to quit at any time.
- High scores saved to HD.
- Patched addressing errors

The gfx will be come currupt for a few 2nds right after the Eye of Horus
title screen.  Then the screen will fade and then back to normal.  I still
have to fix this.

It has been successfully tested on a A1200/030/40MHz/10MB.
