Welcome to the Third Issue of @{FG highlight}@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}@{FG text}!!!  @{FG highlight}@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}@{FG text} is a *NEW*
Monthly UK BBS Scene Magazine containing a comprehensive UK BBS Directory.

Many SysOps have tried their hands at generating up-to-date BBS Lists, but
most have found them too difficult to maintain and have abandoned updating
them, with the exception of the odd few, like Turbo D at @{BG fill}@{"Alpha Zone BBS" Link AlphaZoneBBS}@{BG background}
who has for the last 6 months supplied a list of BBS Numbers to the AMINET.

However, most BBS Lists contain BBS Numbers of BBSes that have long since
left the scene, and of all the Lists we have encountered, there hasn't
been one that has been accurately up-to-date.

At the time of going to press, ALL the BBSes listed in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} have
been 100% verified as being online.  We have spent the last 4 months
ringing BBS Numbers to find out which BBSes are still online, and to find
out those that have left the scene.  We have still a lot of work to do,
but I'm sure you can appreciate the cost of dialling every BBS Number we
have found in the afore mentioned BBS Lists, and that is why we need YOUR
help in providing us with information of any BBSes you know that are still
online, that are not listed in this issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

Furthermore, we need YOUR help in keeping @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} up-to-date with BBS
Closures, New Numbers, Relaunches, Renames etc.  For more details on how
to contact us, access @{BG fill}@{"Submissions" Link Submissions}@{BG background}.

The BBS Scene is in bad need of positive publicity...and we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
strongly believe that BBS Advertising is a damn good start.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
aims to provide the AMIGA Community with a central resource of information
regarding the current status of the UK BBS Scene, with the added bonus of a
comprehensive UK BBS Directory every month.

We hope that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} will be received favourably by SysOps and BBS
Callers alike, and Correspondence is welcomed from ALL who read this
Issue.  We guarantee that 100% of the Correspondence we receive will be
read and replied to accordingly, and may even be included in the Next Issue
of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

Plans to take @{FG highlight}@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}@{FG text}' coverage beyond the United Kingdom are already
under consideration.  Work on @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has already started, but
we foresee a problem that really needs to be addressed before we continue
any further with the project.  Basically, does the UK BBS Scene really want
an International BBS Directory?  If the answer to this questions is "Yes",
then how do we market it?  Do we release it seperately, to give YOU the
choice whether you want to Download it or not, or do we include it within
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, bearing in mind the Archive Size will probably double?

Please help us to make this decision, get in touch with us at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text},
and let us know what YOU want.  If we get no response from YOU, as readers
of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then the @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} project will be scrapped!!!

We would like to point out that we do take the BBS Scene seriously, and
genuinely want to help revive what can only be described as a dying
industry, but SysOps out there must wake up to the fact that if they don't
advertise their humble abodes, then who is going to know that they are
there?  In researching for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, we have come across many a SysOp,
who despite complaining of reduced Calls and lack of Users, have made no
attempt to do something about it, despite @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} offering them a free
chance to advertise worldwide via the AMINET!!!

AMIGA FORMAT Magazine recently started a column for BBS Numbers in their
Readers Adverts section, and those that have advertised, including
ourselves, have found that advertising DOES work, and that there ARE
members of the AMIGA Community who want to call BBSes, but never knew
where to get in contact with them!  Therefore in respect of all you SysOps
that think that advertising is a waste of time...we rest our case...!!!

Welcome to a *NEW-LOOK* @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  As you have probably noticed by now,
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has had a Cosmetic Make-Over, thanks to a few *NEW* AmigaGuide
Commands provided by S.N.S (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Skull Monkey BBS" Link SkullMonkeyBBS}@{BG background})...Thanks m8!!!

Also, the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Icon has changed, thanks to yet again outside help,
Craig Collins, who's talents in the past have included various Public Domain
Animations, an AMIGA FORMAT Magazine Cover, and until recently worked as a
3-D Graphics Artist for TEAM 17 Software, modelled and rendered an AMIGA
"Boing Ball" in Lightwave for us here at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, which we've turned
into a nice 4-Colour @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Icon...Thanks m8!!!

Thanks must also go to Ronnie Murphy for submitting a 4-Colour replacement
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Icon, which unfortunately we haven't used, and Paul Green for
rendering the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Logo, which we've used for the 24-Bit JPEG Image
included with this Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

The fighting spirit of the humble BBS is still alive and kicking out there,
still offering a service to their loyal Callers who Log-On to them on a
regular basis to Download whatever Files take their fancy, and satisfying
the hardy SysOps to keep there BBSes open for a little longer, despite the
hammering they take from the Internet.

When we first researched for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to find out just how many BBSes
were still up and running, we were pleasantly suprised by the number we
found were still online, and those 124 BBSes we found, were entered into
the First Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  That 124 BBSes has now grown to 185 BBSes
for the Third Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, just proving that the UK BBS Scene is
far from dead, as was first thought. 

From our point of view, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has really made a difference to the
number of Calls and New Users at our respective BBSes, and many of our New
Users had never been on a BBS before in their lives, the Internet, yes, but
never a BBS, as they thought that BBSes were extinct.  Feedback from other
SysOps who advertised in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} suggests that they have experienced the
same result, which proves a point, that SysOps should not just sit back and
accept the number of Users in their User-Base, but should advertise their
BBSes as much as possible, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} giving them that very chance.

The Internet has done much damage to the UK BBS Scene, especially when Free
ISPs were launched, but that damage is not irrepairable, as we have proven,
and ironically @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has used the Internet to get to it's prospective
audience, to get Internet Users back to the UK BBS Scene, and it appears to
have worked, and worked well.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been well received from SysOps and BBS Users alike, and the
Correspondence we have received has been tremendous.  We honestly didn't
believe that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would be so popular, and never expected @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
to achieve the results that we have witnessed after only its Second Issue!!!

We would like to thank ALL of YOU that have contacted @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} since its
launch, without your input and feedback, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} could not have grown
to what it has become for its Third Issue.

Please keep the Correspondence coming, we would especially like to hear from
SysOps who have advertised their BBSes in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and have benefitted
as a result.  Also, if any of you have any ideas on how we can improve the
content of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, or if you have anything at all to contribute to
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then please get in touch, even if you only have a sentence or
two to say, ALL Correspondence will be read and replied to, and may even
get included in the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!

See you Next Issue...

       @{u}Thanks For CoNnEcTiOnS - By S.N.S (SysOp Of Skull Monkey BBS)@{uu}

Just thought I would put fingers to keyboard to say what a brilliant idea
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is!!!  Since advertising in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, my BBS has had quite a
few *NEW* Callers, Callers who without advertising, would not have known I
existed.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is proof that BBSes are still very much active, with *NEW* BBSes
opening all the time.  This can only be a good thing for everyone involved
in the BBS Scene, be it an AMIGA or PC BBS.

Both Dunkie & Pete, Editors of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} have said the following statement
from the very First Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and as a SysOp who has benefitted
from advertising in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, I certainly agree with them both when they
address those SysOps who say advertising is a waste of time and ask them,
"How do people know your BBSes exist, if you don't advertise them???"

Thanks for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!

"@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is presented very well, but perhaps you could indicate whether
they are AMIGA or PC BBSes.  A good effort!!!"

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

Most of the research done by @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} involves a lot of Phone Calls to
BBS Numbers listed from various sources, often very much out of date!!!
As a result of this, we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} usually test a BBS Number by calling
the Number by Voice Phone, thus enabling us to speak to the person at the
other end, should a BBS no longer be operating from that Number.  Obviously,
if we get a Modem screaming down the Phone Line at us, then we can safely
assume that the BBS is still in operation, and therefore the BBS gets
entered into @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

This is where the difficulty arises in distinguishing which BBS is an AMIGA
or PC BBS.  Without actually logging on to the BBS itself, we have no idea
whether the BBS is an AMIGA or PC BBS, and I'm sure you can appreciate that
it would increase our Phone Bills even more, if we were to implement such a
system of verification!!!  However, if @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers provide us with
this information, then I'm sure we can develop @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to include the
AMIGA or PC BBS indication in the near future!!!

 *FILES*

 14 Online CDs, basically the last 14 Aminets.  Frost Free also regularly
 downloads the latest Aminet files direct to disk for BBS download and Freq.

 *FREQS*

 All files on the BBS and CDs are available for Freq.

 Freq FILES for the Disk based Filelist or AMINET<Number> for the CD File
 Lists, e.g AMINET23

 *MAIL*

 Fidonet - Amiganet - Landnet - Vibeznet - Studentnet - Fluffynet.

 Any echo, no matter how obscure is available.  Mail can be read online or
 via Fido Software.

 Point applications are welcome from old and new.

 E-Mail addresses are available to BBS Users and Fido Users.

 Mail is available via Email to Nodes and Points.

 There is also an IRC channel #FrostFree where points, users and whoever
 else meet up on a nightly basis.  It gets a bit wacky so be warned :)

 *GAMES*

 If you really are a complete anorak, you can play ANSI BBS games.  Enjoy
 yourself and make BT richer while the rest of us go to Dixons and buy a
 PlayStation for 99 quid.

 *EPILOGUE*

 Frost Free is a BBS, it has Files on CD, it has important files not on CD,
 it also carries mail and the SysOp will look after you.

 Thank you.

 Dave Naylor (The SysOp of Frost Free) (Honest)
