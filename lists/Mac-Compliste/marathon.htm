<h3><b>
Marathon:</b></h3>
First-person, Texture-mapped, 3D Dungeon Game. This is another Doom-like game. You
are trying to fight off aliens which have invaded your spaceship. Very smooth 
graphics, and better gameplay. You have a radarscop to let you know when trouble
is comming, and there is more freedom of movement. You can also aler your view up
or down. Finally, you have a shield which you can re-charge as manytimes as you want,
once you find a charging station. Published by Bungie.

<p>

<h3><b>
Marathon II:</b></h3>
First-person, Texture-mapped, 3D Dungeon Game. This is another Doom-like game. Not
much different from the original Marathon, other than slightly improved graphics, and
a few new weapons. All new monsters and scenarios though. You are still fighting off
alien invaders in your space-station, and you still have your radar scope and re-
chargable shield. Published by Bungie.

<b>Tested on:</b><br>
A4000 with Macro-System`s WARP ENGINE `040 running at 40MHz, Cybervision-64 (4-meg),
Toshiba 6.7 speed SCSI-II CD-ROM, Amiga OS 3.1
