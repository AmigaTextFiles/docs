WolfPack:  Submarine Simulator.  World War II German U-Boats are at your
command.  Switch to any boat in the WolfPack of up to 6 boats.  Control the
subs as you try to sink allied shipping.  Watch out for Destroyers!  Good
graphics and very involved Gameplay.  Much more complicated than Silent
Service.  Published by Nova Logic.
