Fantastic! 4 CD`s of adventure. Just getting started now, but it runs great!
Don`t know how it looks on a stock machine - I bought this one after I got
the Warp Engine, but I think it will play on stock `040`s - maybe even a fast 
`030 ... It is full-screen though - no 1/4 screen option like Daedalus Encounter.

Full-Motion Video Adventure; 4 CD Roms. You are a Police Officer of the 
future who has been tracking a deadly terrorist known as Angel Devoid. When
you crash while chasing him, he captures you and takes you to a plastic surgeon
who alters your face so that you look like him! Now you must escape the hospital
and find the real Angel Devoid, while also fleeing from your own Police buddies,
who think that YOU are Angel Devoid. Lots of interactive action video seyuenes, 
and much of your success depends on how you deal with people you meet, using the
"Attitide Panel". Published by Mindscape.
