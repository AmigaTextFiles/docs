<td valign=top>Description:</td>
<td>1) "Defeat a vast armada of exotic align warships as they unleash
a deadly assault on earth, then take to outer space as you drive the aliens back to
their own planet. Watch the dramatic struggle unfold through over 50 minutes of
Hollywood-style video. An enhanced 3-D terrain engine lets you slice through the 
landscape faster and smoother than ever before, and the improved polygon count 
heightens the rush as you dive through canyons and between skyscrapers. This
revolutionary 3-D space fighter epic takes entertainment technology to the limit!"
- Electronic Arts<p>
2) Space Shoot-em-up. Fly your ship close to the ground as you battle invading 
aliens on earth, then attack them at their base on Mars. More like a basic flight 
simulator, this game is all action. Blast away at the aliens, but watch your fuel
and weapons status, and don`t fly into any buildings! Great graphics detail, but
you need a very fast machine to take advantage of them. Looks great in 16-bit 
color. 50 minutes of full-motion video help to keep the game atmosphere interesting.
