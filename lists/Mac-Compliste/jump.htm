<td valign=top>Hardware needed:</td>

<td valign=top>Description:</td>
<td>It`s mainly an Actiongame, were you control a high-tech car and fly
it through a city. You can equip your car with various forms of weapons
to kill your enemies. Some jobs can be given over to your computer-Player,
so that you can either choose to drive/fly/aim weapon or even combine some
of those. The hole game is "pseudo"-3D which means that you can change your
view only about 90 degrees. But your enemies grow when they advance.<br>
<p>
The story is that only you can find the last resources of intact human
genes that were stolen from a genetic laboratory and brought into a big
selfruling city-jail</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top>Problems:</td>
<td>NO SPEECH OUTPUT POSSIBLE. Which is as I believe not a problem of my
config as on a other computer equipped with 3640/PicassoIV/12MB/System 7.5.3
the problem was the same. This is not a big problem, as only the story in the
beginning and your mission is spoken. Sorry NO text can be turned on. SoundFX
during the game works fine.</td>

<tr>
<td valign=top>Tested on:</td>
<td>A4000, Cyberstorm060/50MHz, Kick/WB3.1, Cybervision64, Cyberscsi V8.6BETA,
Pioneer-DR124X-SCSI-CD-ROM drive, 34 MB RAM (22 MB assigned to Shapeshifter),
MacOS 7.5.5,</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top>Rating:</td>
<td>Hmmmmm.......not that bad, but not that surprising either. I didn`t play
it long, as I didn`t like it. The Intro is great, but imho that is all. With 
the above noted problems it is to expensive and lacking fun. So better buy
another game.</td>

On a Cyberstorm 060/50MHz it is slower than on a Cyberstorm 040/40MHz but
it`s not unplayable on the 060!
