It runs on any machine, but the faster the better for some of the arcade sequences.
Later in the game, you almost need a Warp Engine or a CyberStorm to get past one
challenge, since slower machines don`t update the display fast enough. Still, in
256 color mode it is playable on a stock `040 (25mhz). Much better in 15-bit
color mode though!

Daedalus Encounter:  Full-Motion Video Adventure; 3 CD Roms.  Over 2 hours
of live-action video.  You and 2 crew mates have crashed your ship into a
large object which is hurtling towards the sun.  The three of you must work
together to stay alive.  Most of the video scenes are not interactive; they
serve to tell the story.  There are some interactive action sequences, but
most of the gameplay revolves around geometric puzzles.  Often you will
need to solve a puzzle to open a door, turn on equipment, etc.  You can
save your game at any time, and multiple saves are strongly recomended.
