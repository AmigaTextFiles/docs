A single player dungeon simulation.  The object of the game is to defeat
the Balrog, which lurks in the deepest levels of the dungeon.  You begin at
the town level above the dungeon, where you may acquire supplies, weapons,
armor, and magical devices by bartering with various shop owners, before
descending into the dungeon to do battle.  Amiga enhancements include pull
down menus, graphics mode, pickup mode, a continuous move mode, a real time
mode, a message wait time mode, as well as other modifications to improve
overall playability and to take advantage of the unique features of the
Amiga.  Requires at least 1Mb of memory.
