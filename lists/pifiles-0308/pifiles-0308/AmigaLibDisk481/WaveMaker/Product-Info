.description
WaveMaker is intended to give beginning music and physics students a "hands
on" feel for how complex waves are made by adding a harmonic series of sine
waves.  A fundamental and up to seven harmonics are available.  The
resulting waveform can be displayed on the screen or played on the audio
device using the keyboard like a piano.  A game mode is also provided.
With several bugs fixed, more efficient code, and a new display option.
