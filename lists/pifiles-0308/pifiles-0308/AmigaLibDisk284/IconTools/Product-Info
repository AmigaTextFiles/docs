Here are some tools for icon tricks.  Note that these tools are really
hacks because they exploit some areas of the .info files that the current
version of WorkBench does not clear or reset upon loading the icon.  There
are three programs here which allow WorkBench drawer windows to appear in
non-standard colors and allow you to move the position of the file name
text to anywhere in the icon's graphic.  Released to the public in the hope
that 1.4 will allow more flexible user customization of the WorkBench
appearance.
