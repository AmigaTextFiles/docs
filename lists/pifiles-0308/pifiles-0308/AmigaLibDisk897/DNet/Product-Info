.description
A link protocol that provides essentially an unlimited number
of reliable connections between processes on two machines,
where each end of the link can be either an Amiga or a Unix
(BSD4.3) machine.  Works on the Amiga with any EXEC device
that looks like the serial.device.  Works on UNIX with tty and
socket devices.  Achieves better than 95% average throughput
on file transfers.
