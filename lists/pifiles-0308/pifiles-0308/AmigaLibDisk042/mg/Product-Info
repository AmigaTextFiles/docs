.description
A small EMACS editor that uses the GNU EMACS command set.  Mg is a small
but powerful text editor that runs on many other computer systems besides
the Amiga.  One of MG's major goals is to be compatible with its cousin GNU
Emacs, so certain features you may have seen in other versions of
MicroEmacs may work differently here, or not exist.  Hopefully, you'll find
the added features MG provides to be worth the trouble it takes to make the
switch.  This is the fourth Beta distribution of mg.
