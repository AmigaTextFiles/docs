Size checker uses a list of possible sizes of a file to check for
unexpected changes in the size of those files.  For example, it can be used
to spot a link virus or to point out changes in the configuration of your
system.  With the appropriate comments added to your size list, you can
check to see what version of the files you are using (1.2, 1.3, 1.4, ARP,
etc).
