.description
Demo version of a shareware genealogy database program.  The PAL version
has been distributed in Australia and England for some time.  This NTSC
demo version is complete except that it is limited to 600 persons/300
marriages, does not support a text-editor to add free-form reports to
records and does not show Digi-view pictures from within the program.  The
color requester is not included as this entails adding a library file to
libs: and is not really needed.  A-Gene needs 1Mb of ram, and a printer/2nd
disk drive are a big help.
