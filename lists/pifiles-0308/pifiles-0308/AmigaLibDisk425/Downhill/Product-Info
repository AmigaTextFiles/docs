A skiing arcade game.  Ski skylar mountain, a dangerous, steep, downright
scary mountain with bonus flags to pick up, rocks, bushes, and branches to
jump over, all while avoiding obstacles such as trees.  The longer you stay
up the faster you ski and the more points you get.  Joystick required,
works only under AmigaDOS 1.3.
