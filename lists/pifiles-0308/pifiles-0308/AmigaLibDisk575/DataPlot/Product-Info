A program that plots data and algebraic functions in 2D.  The user simply
clicks on an option screen to select various options, such as type of
marker, log or linear axis, auto vs manual scaling, gridlines.  The macro
language makes similar, repetitive plots easy to do.  Data points can be
transformed by an algebraic function prior to plotting.  A macro can be
automatically executed upon startup-up.  Plots in any resolution from
320x200 to 640x400.  Plots can be saved as macro commands and IFF ILBM
files.  Prints directly to Epson compatible printers, or to any Preferences
supported graphics printer via the PLT: device.  Which now includes a
Legend command, and is now freeware.  Fixes several bugs, including the
optimizer for DrawFunction.  Update to version 2.1 on disk 532.  Source
available from the author.
