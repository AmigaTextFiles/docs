A program that opens a narrow window and graphically both displays your
memory usage like a gauge, and also detects changes in regions of memory
over time.  Detected changes are catagorized and displayed using color
coded bands.  It accomodates AmigaDOS 2.0 and the Amiga 3000 32-bit memory
addresses.
