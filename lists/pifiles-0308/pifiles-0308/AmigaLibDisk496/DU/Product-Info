.description
A Workbench 2.0-aware DU program.  Unlike other Amiga DU programs, it will
skip over links to files and links to directories.  Not only does this give
a more accurate representation of how much space the contents of a
particular directory are taking up, it also prevents infinite loops when a
directory has a link to one of it's ancestors.
