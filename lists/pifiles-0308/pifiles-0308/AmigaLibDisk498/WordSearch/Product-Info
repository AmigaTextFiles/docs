This is an automated wordsearch generator.  Words orientations can be
limited to any subset of the eight primary directions and the puzzle can be
rotated or flipped.  It has a spartan but functional user interface
highlighted by the req.library.  The system default font under WB 2.0 is
supported for the puzzle display window.
