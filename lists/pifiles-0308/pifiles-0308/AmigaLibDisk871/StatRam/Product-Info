Stat-RAM or 'SD0:' is a very fast recoverable ram drive that takes
advantage of FFS under WB2 or FFS International under WB2.1 or 3.  This
work is based on ASDG's 'VD0:'.  ASDG-RAM has been reliable for many years
since it was placed in the PD.  However it has always been slow because it
uses OFS, or old file system.  On an accelerated machines, SD0: is up to 7
times faster, and averages 5 times faster than the original VD0:.  It's
also 4 to 5 times faster than RRD.  It survives the deepest re-boot, even
the ColdReboot of rekicking a KS file.
