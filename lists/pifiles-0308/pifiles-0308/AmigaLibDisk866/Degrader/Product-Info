.description
Degrades your machine to try and get badly written programs to work.
Allows you to block memory, add non-autoconfig memory at reset, turn audio
filter on or off, intercept privilege violation errors, switch off
cache/burst modes and can slow down a fast machine.  Also can swap the boot
drive and force 50Hz or 60Hz.  Will do things straight away, after one
reset or after every reset.
