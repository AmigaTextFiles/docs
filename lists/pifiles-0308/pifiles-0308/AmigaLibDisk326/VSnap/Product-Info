This is an enhanced version of Snap 1.3, submitted by Steve Vermeulen,
which adds the ability to save clipped graphics as IFF FORM ILBM's to the
clipboard, so they can be imported to other programs that understand IFF
and the clipboard.  I have dubbed it VSnap, since the official 1.4 Snap is
also included on this disk.
