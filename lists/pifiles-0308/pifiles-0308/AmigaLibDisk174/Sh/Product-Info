Another version of the 'Sh' utility to unshar shell archives.  Apparently
corrects some problems encountered by similar programs.  Until we can get
everybody using some sort of "standard", perhaps if we collect enough of
these utilities, we will eventually find one that works with the particular
archive we're trying to unshar!
