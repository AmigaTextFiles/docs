Programs to encode/decode binary files for transmittal via mail or other
text-only methods.  The binary file is expanded by approximately 35% for
transmittal.  This release is an update to the version on disk number 38,
and includes a simple line-by-line checksum technique that can read and
write files compatible with the older uuencode/uudecode.
