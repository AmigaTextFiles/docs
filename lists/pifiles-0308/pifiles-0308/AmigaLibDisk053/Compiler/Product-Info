.description
An optimizing C compiler for the 68000.  Has successfully compiled itself
on a 68000 based Unix system V machine, but has yet to be fully ported to
the Amiga.  It will currently produce assembly output for simple C routines
on the Amiga, but needs lots of work to be really useful as anything other
than a learning tool for budding compiler guru's.
