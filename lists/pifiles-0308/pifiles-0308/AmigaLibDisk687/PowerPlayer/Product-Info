.description
A very powerful, user friendly and system friendly module player.  It can
handle nearly all useful module-formats (Noisetracker, MED, Oktalyzer,
etc.), can read powerpacked modules and comes along with its own cruncher
that uses the powerful lh.library written by Krekel/Barthel.  Needs the
powerpacker.library and the reqtools.library to run, both included in the
package.  Also includes some sample modules.
