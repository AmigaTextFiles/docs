.description
A commodities screen blanker written for Kickstart and Workbench 2.04 (or
higher).  When running will blank the screen and start to draw real plane
fractals such as described in the September 1986 issue of Scientific
American.  The resulting images may remind you of spiders' webs, lace or
even the Chladnian patterns formed by grains of sand strewn across a
vibrating surface.  And includes numerous bug fixes and enhancements (such
a new fractal type and a font-sensitive user interface).
