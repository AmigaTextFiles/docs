.description
An AmigaBasic DC-10 instrument flight simulator.  Appears to be quite
in-depth with flight-planning and take-off options along with an extensive
documentation file.  Requires rebuilding on a separate disk and was
successfully done so by following the author's instructions in the
ReadMe_First file.
