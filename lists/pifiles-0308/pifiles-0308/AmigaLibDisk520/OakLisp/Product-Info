.description
A straight port of the OAKLISP system to the Amiga.  OAKLISP is a
Scheme-like LISP with an object-oriented base.  An R3RS Scheme environment
is included in the package.  Because of its size, the distribution is made
on two disks, 519 and 520.  Both disks are required.  Source is included.
