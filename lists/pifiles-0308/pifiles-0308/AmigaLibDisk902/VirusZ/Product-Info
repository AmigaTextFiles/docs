.description
A virus detector that recognizes over 220 boot viruses and over 115 file
viruses.  The filechecker can also decrunch files for testing.  The memory
checker removes all known viruses from memory without 'Guru Meditation' and
checks memory for viruses regularly.  VirusZ has easy to use intuitionized
menus including keycuts for both beginners and experienced users.  VirusZ
performs a self-test on every startup to prevent link virus infection.
Written entirely in assembly language and operates with Kickstart 1.2/1.3,
OS 2.0 and OS 3.0.
