Personal Phonedirectory (PPD) was designed to remember addresses
and phone numbers for you, and also dial the numbers automaticly.
PPD was designed especially with multitasking in
mind. When you are doing something else, its window can be
minimized, and when you need to, you can call someone just by
a click on the mouse. PPD uses almost no system power when
not used.
