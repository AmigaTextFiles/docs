.description
Very comprehensive program to monitor and control system activity.  Monitor
cpu, memory usage, ports, interrupts, devices.  Close windows, screens,
show loaded fonts or last Guru code number.  Clean up memory, flush unused
libraries, devices, fonts. etc. and a whole bunch more! Spawns its own
process.  A very handy background task to have loaded.  Changes include
mostly bug fixes and some minor enhancements.  Assembly source included.
