Release 4.0 of a program for drawing representations of the Earth's
surface.  New features include using the full Micro World Data Bank data
files, user selection of the items to be included (e.g., coastlines,
rivers, etc.) and the amount of detail in each map, and a redraw function.
Corrects a problem with box and text selection encountered under AmigaDos
2.04, but AmigaDos 2.04 is not required.  Requires 1.5 megabytes of memory
and a hard disk with 1.6 megabytes of free space.  Also includes version
requiring a 68020 CPU and 68881 FPU.  This is an update to version 3.1 on
disk 545.  Includes full source.  Distributed in two parts, the other part
is on disk 639.
