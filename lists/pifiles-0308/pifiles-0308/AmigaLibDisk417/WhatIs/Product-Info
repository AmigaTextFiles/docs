.description
A neat little utility which not only recognizes a wide variety of file
types (executables, IFF, icons, zoo files, etc), but prints interesting
information about the structure or contents of the recognized file types,
such as what libraries, devices, resources, fonts, etc. a program uses.
And is for AmigaDOS 2.0 only.
