.description
A command for visiting all the files of a subtree of an Amiga file system,
testing every file in the specified subtree against a supplied "filter"
expression, and if the file passes through the filter, to issue the
specified command with that file as one of the arguments.  It is designed
to be reasonably fast, robust, and not use a lot of stack space or any
other critical resources.
