.description
A computer simulation of three-dimensional crystal lattices which permit
you to observe stereoscopic views of any of the fourteen Bravais lattices
with a variety of orientations, while rotating and posititioning them in
real time.  The frame rate is between 10 and 30 frames per second,
depending upon the options selected and the Amiga being used.  It is
primarily intended for educators and students in physics, chemistry, and
geology.  It is most suitable for use in conjunction with a course in solid
state physics, or a course in crystallography.
