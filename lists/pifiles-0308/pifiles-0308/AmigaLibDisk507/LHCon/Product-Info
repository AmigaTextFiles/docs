.description
A program that will convert Arc and Zoo formatted archives to LHArc format.
This will save precious disk space.  LHCon will do single files or entire
directories.  It also has the capability to preserve the comment field of
the file for BBS programs that require it and for the individuals who label
their programs in that manner.
