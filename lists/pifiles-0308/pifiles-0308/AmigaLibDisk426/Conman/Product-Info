.description
Extremely useful replacement for the standard console handler, provides
line editing and command line histories.  Completely transparent to any
application program that uses CON: windows.  This program is shareware, and
well worth a donation to the author.  Changes include updates for WorkBench
2.0 console refresh and cut/paste, and improvements to window resizing.
