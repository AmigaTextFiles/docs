An Amiga program to display images from a CT scanner, along with several
interesting sample images of scans of real people, including a skull,
brain, heart, and spine.  Each image is 256 by 256 pixels in 2048 gray
scale.  The display software, though it has a primitive user interface, is
quite powerful, including functions like convolutions, averaging,
laplacians, unsharp masking, edge detection, gradients, etc.
