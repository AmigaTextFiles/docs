A program to print fancy customized disk labels.  It will combine an IFF
picture and up to 50 lines of text (which may be placed arbitrarily in any
font or point size) and then print the result.  The IFF picture can be
virtually any size (up to 1008 by 1000).  It will also print labels from a
batch file produced by SuperBase.
