An easy to use Window Title Bar Pattern Editor for use with TBar.  Load,
save, test, and edit patterns.  Saves script files that can be executed
later to change window patterns at anytime (like on boot-up).  Includes
TRand, a utility to pick a random TBar file so your WorkBench will look
different each time you reboot.
