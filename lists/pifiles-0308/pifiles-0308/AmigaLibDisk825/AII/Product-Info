The Archiving Intuition Interface makes things easier if you are archiving
or dearchiving files.  You can do it all with the click of a mouse button,
instead of typing in a whole line in the CLI.  Now supports KickStart 2.xx
as well as 1.3.  Supports several archiving formats including LHa, Zoo,
Arc, UnArj, and UnZip.  Requires reqtools.library.
