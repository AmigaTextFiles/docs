Orm
.description
An improved version of PD "Snake" game on disk number 810 by
Michael Warner.  You control an "orm" (Danish for worm or
snake), living in a small window on the default public screen,
which grows by eating "frogs" and avoiding obstacles.  This
version tries to be smart about its window borders and the
screen mode (Interlace, Superhires, etc.).  Supports locale
library if present.  English, German, Italian, and Swedish
catalogs are supplied.  Default language is Danish.  Includes
the catalog description file and full DICE and SAS/C (Lattice)
compatible source.
