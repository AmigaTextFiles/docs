Reminder
.description
A utility to remind you about events.  It consists of an event
editor and a small program that is put in your WBStartup (or
run from S:user-startup).  Every time you boot your machine,
this program checks the event database and puts up a requester
(and optionally calls an ARexx script) if there are events
that you need to be reminded about.
