System Utility
.short
Tool to reduce the Workbench from two bitplanes to one
.description
OnePlane gropes through system structures, looking for the size and address
of the highest WorkBench bitplane, and frees it, returning the memory to
the system for re-use.  It was written to produce a monochrome Workbench
from a four-color Workbench, so that text could scroll faster. With the
advent of OS2.0, it is not as useful as it once was.
