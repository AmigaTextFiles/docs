A two dimensional turing machine simulator.  Imagine a small bug crawling
around on your computer display moving one pixel at a time. At each step it
uses its internal state number and the color of the pixel it's on as
indexes into a set of tables to decide what color to change the pixel to,
what direction to move, and what its new internal state should be.
