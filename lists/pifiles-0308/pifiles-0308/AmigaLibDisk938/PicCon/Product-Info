.description
PicCon is a program to aid developers of Amiga software for including
graphical images in their own programs.\n\n
In a full featured GUI you are able to cut out any portion of a loaded
picture and save it back to disk in a variety of formats. Supported formats
include: ordinary bitplanes, interleaved bitplanes, chunkypixels,
blittermasks, Amiga sprites, workbench icons and lots of variations on
these main formats.\n
You can also save the picture's palette in a variety of formats, including
ordinary raw 4, 8, or 32 bits-per-gun, Amiga copperlists and more.\n
All saves can be done in either binary or in sourcecode (assembler or C).\n\n
The pictures which contain your images can be stored in any format you've
got datatypes' support for as the datatypes.library supplied with OS3.0 is
used by PicCon.
