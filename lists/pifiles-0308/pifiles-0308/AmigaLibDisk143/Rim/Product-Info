RIM-5 (Relational Information Manager) is a full relational DBMS that is
suitable for VERY large databases using B-Tree data storage.  It has a
crude (by today's standards) user interface, but since full source code is
provided, this can be fixed.  Versions of RIM run on a wide variety of
systems, small and large, and produce compatible databases.  Also includes
a built in HELP database and a programming language.  Full Fortran source
code and documentation included.
