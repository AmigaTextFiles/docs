Animated 3D articulated robot arm with C source.
.description
The program allows the user to manipulate a 3-D robot arm in an
intuitive fashion. All input is through a mouse/menu interface. The current
rotation angles for each joint of the arm are presented to the user in
proportional (Intuition) gadgets. The same gadgets allow the user to alter
the joint angle settings. The arm can be programmed to animate between 2
sets of joint settings. The arm has 3 joints. The shoulder and wrist can
move (with constraints on the angle magnitude) about all 3 axes. The elbow
can rotate about one axis only (typical of hominoids). Full C source for the
program is included as an example of 3D animation transformations.
