Yet another anti-virus program with a twist.  Once installed a message is
displayed just after a warm or cold boot notifying the the user that the
disk and memory are virus-free, and forcing a mouse-button press before
continuing.  Anything writing to the bootblock thereafter will destroy the
message and a normal virusinfected boot (???) will take-place.  Versions
1.01 and 2.01,
