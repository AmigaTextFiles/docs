A quick and dirty port of a Unix version of a freely distributable screen
oriented, interactive, spelling checker.  I use the Unix version daily and
it is very nice.  You will need expansion ram to run this with the supplied
dictionary, as it loads the entire 300K hashed dictionary into memory.  A
hard disk is also recommended.
