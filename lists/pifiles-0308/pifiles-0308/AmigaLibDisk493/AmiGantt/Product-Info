.description
A project definition and management tool designed to create a simple,
interactive method of outlining the task required to complete a particular
project, using the GANTT chart as the input format.  AmiGantt displays the
project in a multiwindow mode with separate windows for the GANTT chart,
task information input, resource histogram display, and Pert chart display.
Up to 500 tasks may be defined for any project, and a project may contain
other projects as tasks.
