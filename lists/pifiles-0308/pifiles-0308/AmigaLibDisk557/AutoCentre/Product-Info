.description
A utility for AmigaDOS 2.0 that will automatically centre any
new screens that are opened. This is especiallly usefule when
you have an overscanned Workbench screen under 2.0 but find
that a lot of applications still open on a 640 wide screen
that is aligned to the left edge of your screen. With this
program, these screens will be centred as they are opened.
