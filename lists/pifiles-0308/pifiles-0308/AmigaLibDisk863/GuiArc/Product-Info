.description
A graphical user interface for cli-based archivers like lha,
arc, ape, zoo, etc.  It has the 'look & feel' of a directory
tool and can perform all basic actions on archives, such as
Add, Extract, List, Test, Delete, etc.  You can enter archives
as if they were directories.  You don't have to know anything
about archivers.  Fully configurable.
