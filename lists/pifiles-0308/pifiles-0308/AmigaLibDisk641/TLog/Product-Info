.description
An intuition based program that records statistics to monitor atheletic
training progress.  Maintains a daily record of distance, time, heart rate,
weight and temperature.  Links a text file with the record for a free form
diary.  The AREXX commands provide the basis for generating custom reports
from the data base.  Sample script allows TLog to automatically get to a
scheduler to post reminders of upcoming events.
