A simple game where you, the young adventurer, must try to escape the
king's Maths Adventure.  To do this you must pass through a series of
rooms.  In each room you are given a math problem to solve, after which you
can proceed to the next room if you answer correctly.  The problems become
more involved and more difficult in each room.  This is an update to the
version on disk 602.
