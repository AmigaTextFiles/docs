.short
Shell command for icon manipulation
.description
An easy to use shell command that gives you control over Workbench icons.
It's main purpose is to update the look of your icons for AmigaDOS 2.0,
which can be done by swapping the colors in an icon or giving new images
to them.  Moreover, it can be used to clear an icon's absolute position
in a drawer or on Workbench.  So it is also a helpful tool if you are
not yet using AmigaDOS 2.0.
