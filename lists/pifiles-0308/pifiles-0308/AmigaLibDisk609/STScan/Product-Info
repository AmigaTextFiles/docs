.description
A utility program for using a Siemens ST400 SCSI flatbed scanner with the Amiga.
Can be adapted to other SCSI scanners and serves as an example of SCSI direct access
to SCSI devices. This version adds image processing and vectorization functions
that can also be used without any scanner
