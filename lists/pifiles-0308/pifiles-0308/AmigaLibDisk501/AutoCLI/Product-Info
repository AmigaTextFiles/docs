A 'PopCLI' type replacement that works with WorkBench 2.0 and fully
compatible with A3000 & accelerator boards.  Always retains the default
path and stack, and current directory.  Can automatically open CLI/SHELL
windows to 1 pixel less than screen size on opening.  Other features
include an optional Function-key press with the qualifier to execute an
S:script file.  Update to version on disk 424 with more enhancements.
