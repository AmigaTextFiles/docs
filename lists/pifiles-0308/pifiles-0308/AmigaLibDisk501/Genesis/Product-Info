.description
A uniquely flexible and powerful program for generating and rendering
fractal landscapes.  Original algorithms allow incorporating fractal rivers
as integral parts of the landscapes, with natural looking river valleys,
gulleys, waterfalls, and lakes.  A number of parameters can be varied to
modify the landscape construction process and change the character of the
final landscape, there is also great flexibility in the rendering.  This is
a demo version of the commercial product by the same name available from
Microillusions and has some features disabled.
