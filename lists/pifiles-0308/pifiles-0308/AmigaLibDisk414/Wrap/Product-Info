Wraps SA OBJECTS about sphere, cylinder.

This program wraps Sculpt OBJECTS around a sphere or cylinder.  It has many
options allowing many interesting results.  WRAP has an advantage over true
surface mapping in that it produces objects, not images, and can be manipulated
as such to produce some really neat effects.
