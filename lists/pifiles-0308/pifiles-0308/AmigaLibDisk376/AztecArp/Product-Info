.description
An Arp package fixed to work with the 5.0 release of the Aztec 'C'
compiler.  The original Manx support files were incomplete, contained bugs,
and had the wrong linker format.  This is an update to the version on disk
number 353, fixing a couple of bugs and adding some new useful features.
