.description
A small program which calls an ARexx script at regular intervals,
controlled through a Workbench window.  Although intended to provide an
"AutoSave" function for applications, the script can do anything.  Includes
C source, which demonstrates simple use of GadTools and the timer device.
Requires Kickstart 2.0 or later.
