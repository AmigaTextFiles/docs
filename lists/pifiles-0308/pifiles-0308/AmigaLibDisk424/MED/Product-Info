.description
A music editor much like SoundTracker.  A song consists of up to 50 blocks
of music, which can be played in any order.  Editing features include
cut/paste/copy tracks or blocks, changing the vibrato, tempo, crescendo,
and note volume.  Other features include switching of the low-pass-filter
on or off on a per song basis, and a cute little animated pointer of a guy
doing "jumping jacks" in time to the music!
