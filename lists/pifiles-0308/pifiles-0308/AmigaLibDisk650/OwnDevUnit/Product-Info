Extended locking for serial devices.
.description
Provides an extended locking mechanism for serial devices.  This allows
programs to "ask" another program that is currently using a device to
relinquish it.  For example, a term program could ask a fax daemon to
release the serial device to allow the user to call out.

OwnDevUnit.library has become, for better or for worse, something of a
defacto standard for Amiga communications software.  Most major terminal
programs now support it, along with several daemons such as Getty, Welmat,
and AmigaFax.

This is an update to version 2.0.  It addresses a problem 2.0 had with
naming schemes.  Version 2.1 is considered the minimum acceptable
version of the library for several packages that support it.
