DMon
.description
DMon is a multi-purpose utility written for the author's
personal use during program development.  It is a Monitor,
Dissassembler, Debugger and development system.  You may
find similarities to Amiga Monitor by Timo Rossi, but DMon
is different, it can dissassemble and debug 68xxx software
in User and Supervisor Mode.  If you do not know what that
means, then do not use DMon!
