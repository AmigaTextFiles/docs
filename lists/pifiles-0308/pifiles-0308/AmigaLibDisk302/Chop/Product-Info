A program which uses a hotkey to chop a displayed screen down to a temporary
maximum of 4 planes in lo-res or 2 planes in hi-res, allowing the processor
full speed access to chip memory.  Only the displayed screen is affected, the
program painting the screen continues to work with the full color palette.
Unchoping the screen puts everything back to normal.  Binary only.
