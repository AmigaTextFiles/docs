.description
A 'PopCLI' type replacement that works with WorkBench 2.0.  Also fixes the
problem with PopCLI crashing the machine if used on a PAL Amiga to open a
CLI window with a vertical size greater than 200 lines.  Other features
include an optional Function-key press with the qualifier to execute an
S:script file.
