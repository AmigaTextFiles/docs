Control mouse and keyboard for demos
.description
A collection of routines for controlling the mouse and keyboard thru
generation of 'Input Events'.  Implemented as object code to be linked
with your programs.  This is for application writers who like to
include HowToDo programs with their applications.  Users can actually
see how to do things, rather than describing them in document files.
This is not a recorder, mouse and keyboard events are generated in
real time and so the software adapts itself to changes at a particular
execution.  Includes example programs and source in C and assembly.
