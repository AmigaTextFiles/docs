Commodity to cut and paste text
.description
PowerSnap is a utility that allows you to use the mouse to mark
characters anywhere on the screen and paste them somewhere else, like
in the CLI or in a string gadget. PowerSnap will check what font is
used in the window you snap from and will look for the position of the
characters automatically.  It recognizes all non proportional fonts of
up to 24 pixels wide and of any height so this should cover most fonts
used.  Snapping and pasting text is done using the mouse, making
PowerSnap fast and easy to use.
