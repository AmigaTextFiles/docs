Create/Edit sounds with FM synthesis
.description
A program to create sounds with FM synthesis.  It has six operators,
a realtime LFO and a free editable algorithm.  The sound can be played
on the Amiga keyboard or on a MIDI keyboard which is connected to the
Amiga.  The sounds can be saved in IFF-8SVX (one or five octave) or raw
format.  FMsynth has an AREXX port now.  Included are 230 FM sounds.
