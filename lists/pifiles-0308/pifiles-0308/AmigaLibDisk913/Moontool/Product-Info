.description
A port of John Walker's moontool program for UNIX.  It gives a variety of
statistics about the moon, including phase, distance, angular, size and
time to next full moon.  A schematic of the current phase is also shown as
a picture.  This is illustrative only; the accurate phase is shown in the
text.  Now font-sensitive and will automatically use the user-defined
system font (non-proportional).  If the font is too large, the program will
fall-back to Topaz 8.
