.description
A freely distributable raytrace program that takes a text description of a
3D scene and renders it to a 24-bit file which may be converted to HAM or
viewed on an 24-bit card.  The program features sophisticated textures,
constructive solid geometry, and various graphics primitives such as
quadrics (cones, cylinders, etc.), spheres, planes, triangles, smooth
triangles, and quartics (donuts, etc.) Also included are many sample data
files and many utilities for creating new data files and for
post-processing the output files.  Source and executables are included.
Because of its size, the distribution has been split onto two disks.  Disk
513 contains the raytracer and disk 514 contains the utilities.
