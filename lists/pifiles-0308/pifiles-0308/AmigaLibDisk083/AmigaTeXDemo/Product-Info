A demo version of TeX, ported to the Amiga by Tomas Rokicki.  Since this is
a demo version of Tom's commercial product, it has several limitations that
let you get the flavor of the real thing but encourage you to buy the
commercial version.  These limitations include TeX being limited to
processing only small files, the previewer being limited to displaying ten
pages or less, and only a small number of fonts being provided.  The full
version of AmigaTeX comes on eight floppies and will handle larger
documents than most mainframe versions of TeX.  See the tex/README file for
further info.
