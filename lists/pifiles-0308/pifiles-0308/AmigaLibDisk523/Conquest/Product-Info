.description
Lore of Conquest is a war game similar in concept to the board game Risk.
You are the lord of an entire world, destined to rule the galaxy.  Some
worlds are virgin fruits, ready for you to colonize.  Some worlds have
natives who do not wish to accept your rule, these you must conquer for
they will yield more valuable resources.  As you claim the galaxy you will
find, you are not the only one extending your dominion.  This is a
two-player game, so be prepared to defend yourself and take what is yours!
