.description
Yet another variation of a terminal emulator program.  This is a modified
AmigaTerm that can emulate a dumb terminal (interesting paradox here
somewhere...), translate line termination sequences, optionally capture or
discard control characters in the captured file, use audible bell, use
another font, etc.
