.description
Chemesthetics is a program that draws molecules using the calotte model.
This means that atoms are drawn as bowls.  Using this model, even extremely
dangerous molecules like dioxine look quite nice.  Chemesthetics has an
Intuition user interface, can save pictures as IFF files, and has many
example files.
