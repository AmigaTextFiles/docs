A utility that allows you to use the mouse to mark characters anywhere on the
screen, and then paste them somewhere else, such as in another CLI or in a
string gadget.  Checks what font is used in the window you snap from and will
look for the position of the characters automatically.  Recognizes all non-
proportional fonts of up to 24 pixels wide and of any height.  Works with
AmigaDOS 2.0 in both shell and Workbench environments.  Binary only.
