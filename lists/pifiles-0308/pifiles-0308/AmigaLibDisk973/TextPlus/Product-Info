TeX frontend, needs PasTeX or AmigaTeX
.description
TeXt Plus Professional is a TeX frontend word processor. TeX is a
professional freeware typesetting programm. The greatest problem of
TeX for the average user was - up to now - TeX's complexity and the
resulting difficulty to fast and efficiently create documents. This is
where TPP starts to work.

Now you just have to load a form sheet, which has to be modified at
the respective places only. After this the file is compiled to a TeX-
file by TPP, which then itself is processed by the TeX compiler. After
both compilations either the previewer or the printer driver can be
invoked.

TPP cooperates with PasTeX, the freeware Amiga implementation of TeX
written by Georg Hessmann, and with AmigaTeX ((c) Radical Eye
Software). Among TPP's features are tables, staggered lists,
mailmerge, footnotes, inclusion of graphics, an ARexx-port (122
commands) and full OS2.xx/3.xx compatibility. You can make use of all
functions of TeX, even if they are not supported directly, e. g. there
is no editor for mathematical formulae, yet.

TPP combines its user friendliness with the typesetting power of TeX
in order to open the world of TeX to a totally new group of users.

TPP is not only a TeX frontend. You can also use it as a normal editor
and print files via the printer.device.

New Feastures: AmigaTeX is from now on supported; user definable
menus, keymap, and macros; completely localized (available languages:
english, deutsch); clipboard support; AppWindow, AppIcon;
11 new ARexx commands (total number of commands now: 122).
