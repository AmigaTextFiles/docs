The SPOOL system consists of 3 programs: A queue manager, a printer driver,
and a SPOOL request program.  The SPOOL system demonstrates the power of
the Amiga's mutitasking abilities in a very practical way.  It makes
extensive use of Amiga Exec's message passing facilities and list-handling
primitives.
