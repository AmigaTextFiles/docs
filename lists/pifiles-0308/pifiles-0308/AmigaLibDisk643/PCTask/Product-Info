PC-Task is a software IBM-PC emulator.  It allows you to run the majority
of IBM-PC software on your amiga with no additional hardware.  Runs just
like a normal application allowing multitasking to continue.  The program
has a graphical user interface and no additional filesystem/device mounting
is required.  A few clicks with the mouse and it is operational.  CGA, MDA,
Serial, Parallel, Mouse, 2 Floppy drives and 2 Hard drives are emulated.
The hard drives can be partitions or hard drive files like the bridgeboard
can use.  This is demonstration version 1.04.  Full version is available
from the author.
