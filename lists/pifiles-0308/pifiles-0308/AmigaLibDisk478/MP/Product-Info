.description
A small, very useful utility for sending any MIDI data back and
forth between an Amiga and a MIDI instrument (such as a synthesizer).
Helpful for learning about MIDI, writing/debugging MIDI software,
figuring out your instruments system-exclusive implementation, and
more.  Very versatile.  Includes examples.
