.description
AniMan combines Amiga animation, speech synthesis, and voice recognition,
to provide you with an animated talking head that will run any Amiga
program by voice command.  Ask for an Amiga program by name, and AniMan
will oblige.  If AniMan becomes impatient, you may be insulted.  AniMan
will also recite poetry if you ask nicely.  This is An updaate to version
2.1 disk 653.  It corrects a bug that caused AniMan to crash on some
machines but not others.  This version will also automatically adjust for
either NTSC or PAL systems.  Either the Perfect Sound 3 or Sound Master
(Sound Magic) audio digitizer is required along with 1MB of fast memory.
AniMan is like nothing you've ever see before.
