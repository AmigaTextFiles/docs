.decription
This program draws sine roses and is an implementation of algorithm
2 given in the article, "A Rose is a Rose ..." by Peter M. Maurer, see the
reference in the "About Roses" item in the Project menu.  Sine roses are
graphs of the polar equation r = sin(n*d). No mathematical knowledge is
needed; the user interacts with the program through it menus. Images that
are graphed may be saved as standard IFF files and used in other Amiga
applications.
