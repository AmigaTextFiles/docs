AnalytiCalc is a large and powerful spreadsheet program with sufficient
extra features to have some pretentions of acting as an "integrated
system". It is a virtual memory system supporting up to 18000 columns and
18000 rows, multiple equations per cell, an outlining system, built-in cell
annotation, and datafile access from any cell(s) of the sheet, plus an
array of functions not present in most commercial spreadsheets. This is the
initial Amiga port of AnalytiCalc, and as such the console interface is
somewhat crude and in addition requires use of a custom keymap (one such is
supplied) for sensible operation. This will be improved upon, but meanwhile
the program is released with complete sources, documents, and executables.
The graphics program and the DIF file access program are not yet ported;
these will be released when they are ready. AnalytiCalc for the Amiga uses
files compatible with those for AnalytiCalc on MS-DOS, VMS, or RSX-11M or
IAS. An example project planner spreadsheet is included in the distribution
to show off some of the things you can do. More example sheets will be
forthcoming in the future. AnalytiCalc also supports matrix math, FFTs,
infinite windowing, linear regression, date arithmetic, internal and
external macros, LOTS of cell addressing modes, goal seeking in up to 8
dimensions, and more.  AnalytiCalc requires perhaps 600K of RAM memory, at
least one 360K diskette drive, and AmigaDOS 1.2, plus a larger than default
stack.  Display sizes supported can be up to 132 characters wide by up to
76 lines long.
