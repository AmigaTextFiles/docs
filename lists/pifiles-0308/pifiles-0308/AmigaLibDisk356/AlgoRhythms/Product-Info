.description
An algorithmic composition program that improvises music over a MIDI
interface connected to the serial port.  A MIDI interface and synthesizer
are needed.  The music does not have a strong pulse, and does not repeat
motifs or melodies, but can be very pretty.  Version 1.0 with source in C,
and sample data files.
