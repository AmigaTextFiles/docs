.description
A Scheme compiler which accepts the language defined in the essential
portions of Revised Report on Algorithmic Language Scheme, with minor
constraints and some additions.  The compiler produces C source files which
are then compiled using the system's C compiler (Lattice C 5.10 on the
Amiga) to produce conventional object and executable files.  Because of the
size of the distribution, it has been split onto three disks as follows:
source and documentation archives on 556, M68000 binary archive on 557, and
M68020 binary archive on 558.  This Amiga port was done by Mike Meyer,
based on the 28-Sep-90 version of the translator.
