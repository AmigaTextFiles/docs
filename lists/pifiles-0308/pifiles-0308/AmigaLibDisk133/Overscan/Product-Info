Patches the Intuition library so that sizable windows with MaxHeight of 200
(400 in interlace) and screens with Height of 200 (400 in interlace) will
take advantage of the PAL overscan capability of Intuition V1.2.  This
seems to be useful only for European users that wish to run software
written for the American market, without modifying the applications, but
still using the additional space.
