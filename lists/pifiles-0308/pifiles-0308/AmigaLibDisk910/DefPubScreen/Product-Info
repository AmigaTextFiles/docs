A little wedge that makes the front-most screen the default public screen.
If the front-most screen isn't a public screen, nothing changes.  It wedges
into the vertical blanking interrupt server chain and watches Intuition's
record of the front most screen.  When the front-most screen changes, the
main task is signaled and responds by making the front-most screen the
default public screen if possible.  This is all totally transparent and
happens very quickly, and is very handy for people who have seperate
screens for Shell windows etc.
