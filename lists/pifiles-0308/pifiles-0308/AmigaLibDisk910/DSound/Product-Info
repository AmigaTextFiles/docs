.description
DSound is an 8SVX sound sample player that plays samples directly off a
hard drive, without having to load an entire sample into memory first,
making it possible to play samples of any length even under limited memory
conditions.  This version fixes some bugs and adds a display to the DSound
window that shows the length of the sample and the amount played so far,
both in minutes::seconds format.
