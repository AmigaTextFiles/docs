A game built on the addictive game PONGO but with several added features.
You have been assigned the demanding task of cleaning viruses from your
SYSOP's hard disk.  To kill a virus, you simply kick a disk at it.  There
are fifty different levels, and on each level, the speed will increase and
the viruses will be smarter and start to hunt you.
