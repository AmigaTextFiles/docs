.description
This is a shared library package to simplify the ARexx host
creation/management procedure.  Rexx-message parsing is also included
making it possible to control ARexx from programs such as AmigaBASIC (can
you imagine AmigaBASIC controlling AmigaTeX?).  This is version 34.12 which
has been recompiled and made a lot shorter using Aztec 'C' 5.0.
