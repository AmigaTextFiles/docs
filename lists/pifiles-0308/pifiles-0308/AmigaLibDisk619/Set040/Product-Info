.description
A program to remap Kickstart V2.04 or greater from ROM into 32 Bit Ram on
an Amiga equipped with a 68040 CPU, using the MMU, with optional parameters
for greater compatibility between various 68040 boards and optional patch
to stop drives from clicking.  It can also load a different Kickstart than
the one currently in ROM, manipulate both caches, and display information
regarding some 68040 registers and modes.  Code in assembly.
