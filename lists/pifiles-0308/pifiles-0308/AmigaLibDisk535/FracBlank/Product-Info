.description
A commodities screen blanker written for AmigaOS release 2.x.  When running
will blank the screen and start to draw real plane fractals such as
described in the September 1986 issue of Scientific American.  The
resulting images may remind you of spiders' webs, lace or even the
Chladnian patterns formed by grains of sand strewn across a vibrating
surface.  AmigaOS 2.x required.
