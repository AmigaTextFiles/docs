.description
A filing system handler which implements block-mapped filing devices such
as available under Un*x.  Read and write calls are mapped to low-level
system IO operations which allow to treat devices such as df0:, dh0:, rad:,
etc. as big data files.  These `virtual' files can be copied, read and
written just like any standard AmigaDOS file.  It is even possible to copy
a whole disk with the CLI `Copy' command or to archive disks with LhArc and
the like.  Written as a supplement for the Amiga `tar' program.
