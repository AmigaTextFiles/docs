.description
An "Amigatized" port of a Unix version of a freely distributable
interactive spelling checker.  Two major modes of operation: Original
Interactive Mode to allow a user spell check and correct a text document
and ARexx Server Mode that allows the end user to hook ISpell up to text
editors and other things that need a spell checking service.  Regular
expression lookup of word patterns is also possible in ARexx Server Mode.
Includes Arexx macros for GUISpell (included), CygnusEd, Mg, TurboText, GNU
emacs, VLT and WShell.  An update to the version released on disk number
191.  Requires AmigaOS 2.04 or later.
