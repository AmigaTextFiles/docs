An intuition driven interface to GNUChess version 1.51.  I know, this is an
old one.  There are a few advantages, though: IGNUChess is freely
distributable; Full source (SAS/C 6.3) is included; Chess piece images are
provided as an IFF ILBM file (Figuren.ilbm) for free use; Needs only ~200K
memory (+some chip mem for the graphics) and thus runs on small machines
(A500) without memory expansion.  Special version optimized for 68020/30 +
68881/2 included.  Runs in NTSC Interlaced mode.  The graphics are designed
to minimize noticable flicker, so this might be the first interlaced GUI
most 1084 Monitor users like.
