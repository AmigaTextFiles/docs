ArJay Genealogist is a specialized database for keeping track of
genealogical information.  It features a full, easy to use Intuition
interface.  The program is totally non-sexist and secular in nature, and
correctly handles multiple marriages, "unconventional" marriages, adopted
children, and unmarried parents.  The printed reports include descendant
and pedigree charts, personal details reports, family group sheets, and
index lists of people and families.  Free-form note files can be created
using any editor, and IFF pictures can be viewed using any IFF viewer, from
within the program.  Other features include dynamic on-screen ancestor and
descendant charts, extensive online context-sensitive help, flexible
"regular expression" searching, and multiple ARexx ports with an extensive
command set.  Up to 1000 people per database, with databases held in RAM
for maximum speed and responsiveness.  PAL or NTSC, AmigaDOS 2.04+
required.  1 Meg RAM recommended.
