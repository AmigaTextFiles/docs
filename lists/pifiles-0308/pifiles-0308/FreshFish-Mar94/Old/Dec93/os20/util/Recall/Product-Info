Do you keep forgetting about birthdays, anniversaries and other important
events? Well, there are plenty of public domain products on the market that
will prevent that from happening.  But, do you also want to: Keep track of
the remaining days to important events? Keep track of the days since
important events happened? Autostart certain programs depending on the date
and time? Be reminded every # day (eg. every 14th day)? Be reminded # days
in advance or after the event? Be reminded with requesters, alerts or
practically anything that can be displayed on a Amiga monitor? Display
unlimited lines of text in the same requester/alert? Recall does all this
plus much more.
