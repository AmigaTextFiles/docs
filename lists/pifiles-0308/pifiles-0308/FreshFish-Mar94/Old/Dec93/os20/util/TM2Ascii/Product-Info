Have you ever tried to move your ToolManager-icons directory to another
place? Did you rename your Harddisk or get a bigger one? Did your index
finger get tired of endless clicking only to change the path of 42 icons?
The solution is TM2Ascii.  It will read a ToolManager configfile and
translate it to an ASCII (readable!) file.  Use your favorite editor to
globally change everything you want and then use TM2Ascii to change the
file back into ToolManger format.
