A fast, simple parallel data transfer protocol.  It was designed to make
linking any type of machine to any other type as easy as possible.  All
that is required is six 5V I/O lines at each end.  It doesn't matter how
fast or slow each machine is, as the protocol uses a two-line handshake
procedure, ensuring the two machines cannot possibly go out of sync.  Any
two computers supporting the TransNib V1.00 protocol can be linked.  So
far, front-ends exist for Amiga and the Commodore 64.
