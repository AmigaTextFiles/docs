substitute for Dillon's sendmail program.  Features: re-routing of
addresses according to the paths file; mail forwarding for users
(~/.forward and uumail: <user>); nearly command line compatible with
Dillon's sendmail (except -raw); Return-To-Receipt recognition; returning
undeliverable mails to sender and postmaster of your host; support of the
standard Getty, MultiUserFileSystem and AXSh passwd files; smarthost option
if your map files are not perfect; extended log files...  and much more!
Requires OS2.04+, and a DillonUUCP or AUUCP+ environment.
