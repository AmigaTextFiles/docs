.description
A highly capable and flexible, if not seasoned telecommunications tool for
the Amiga.  Terminus is a completely rewritten replacement for JR-Comm
1.02a.  It is not an update.  Terminus conforms, where possible, to the
recommendations outlined in the "Commodore Amiga Style Guide" for Release 2
of the Amiga operating system while still retaining compatibility with the
1.3 release.  However, all future releases of Terminus will be compatible
with the 2.0 (or later) operating system release only.
