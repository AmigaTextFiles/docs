Some programs that attempt to apply a patch to the Progressive Peripherals
Incorporated Zeus SCSI driver.  This patch includes a patch to use the
Wait/Signal mechanism to wait for the completion of SCSI I/O instead of the
"busy-wait" poll method used by the driver.  (These programs will only
patch the 2.98 version of the Zeus ROM.)
