FlexCat is a utility like CatComp (which is available for registered
developers only), KitCat or MakeCat, which creates catalogs and source to
handle them.  The goal in writing FlexCat was to be flexible in the source
that is created.  This is done by using external template files (so called
source descriptions) which can be edited by the programmer.  Any
programming language or individual needs can be satisfied.  This is V1.01
(some minor bug fixes) and includes examples for Assembler, C and Oberon,
an example for handling catalogs in Workbench 2.0, german and italian
catalogs, source and docs in AmigaGuide, Ascii and DVI format.
