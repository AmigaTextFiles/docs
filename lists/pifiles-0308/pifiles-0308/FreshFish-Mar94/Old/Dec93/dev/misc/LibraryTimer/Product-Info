.description
GUI based attempt to figure out what library functions take most of the
processor time in an application, and thus what functions should deserve
more attention when time-optimizing the program.  Does this by patching the
functions in the selected library, then calling ReadEClock in the
timer.device before and after the function is executed.  Requires OS2.04+.
