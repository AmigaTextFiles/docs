.description
A disassembler for the 6502-family of microprocessors.  It will turn C64
(or any other 6502-based computer's) binaries into listings of CPU opcodes.
Supports all officially documented opcodes on the 6502-compatible processor
family.  Future versions will support undocumented opcodes (optionally),
hardware register recognition for the C64 hardware registers, relative
offset disassembling, and a lot more.
