An AGA Screen Color Requester.  The standard Amiga 3.0 Preferences Palette
Requester is very limited in that it only operates on the first eight
screen colors.  Screen Color Requester solves this problem for AGA Amigas
by providing palette controls that allow you to change, copy, swap, spread,
and cycle all individual colors of the workbench or any public screen.  You
can also load and save modified screen palettes for various applications.
AmigaDOS 3.0 is required.  If you are a programmer, you can link the
included object file with your own programs and save yourself the work of
programming a color requester of your own.
