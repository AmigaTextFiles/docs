Screen shot of the author's workbench, after installing his new EGS
Spectrum card.  It is a 1024x768 workbench screen with 256 colours, as you
will be able to see from the open screenmode preferences screen.  It also
has a nice pic of a supermodel's face in a window, has a neat WB backdrop
and uses MagicWB icons.
