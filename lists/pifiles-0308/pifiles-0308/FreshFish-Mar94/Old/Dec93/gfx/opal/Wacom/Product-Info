This Commodity enables you to use a pressure sensitive digitizer tablet
from Wacom with your Commodore Amiga.  The tablet can be used together with
the mouse (or without it) as a direct input medium.  Therefore the driver
can be used together with (nearly) any software.  Furthermore the
(pressure-sensitive) data provided by the tablet can be exported in custom
applications using a documented software interface.  Requires AmigaOS
2.04+.  English and German documentation.  Localized.  But includes some
sample source in C that shows the usage of the software interface.
