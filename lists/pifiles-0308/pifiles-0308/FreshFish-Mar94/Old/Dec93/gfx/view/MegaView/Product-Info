.description
A "Multi-View" kind of program for use with Workbench 2.0+.  It uses the
whatis.library (included) to recognize the file type then invoke a
filetype-specific program.  MegaView can be used from the Shell, from
Workbench, as Default Tool in project icons, as an AppIcon or as an
App-MenuItem.  Enhancements include localization and a GUI-based
FileActions editor.
