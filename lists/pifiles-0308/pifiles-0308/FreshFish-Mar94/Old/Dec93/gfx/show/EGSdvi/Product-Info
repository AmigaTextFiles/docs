.description
A program which runs under the EGS window system.  It is used to preview
DVI files, such as are produced by TeX.  EGSDVI requires EGS version 6 or
higher.  This program has the capability of showing the file shrunken by
various (integer) factors, and also has a `magnifying glass' which allows
one to see a small part of the unshrunk image momentarily.
