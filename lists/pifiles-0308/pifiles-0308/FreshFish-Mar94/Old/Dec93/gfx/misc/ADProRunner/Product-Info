ADPro is a great program, but it requires alot of memory.  Sometimes you
need 3 MB or more to convert a picture.  It is possible to specify
memory-usage in the ADPro icon or from the shell but this can be awkward.
If you do not specify memory size, ADPro takes the largest free hunk of
memory, and leaves you with only small hunks left.  This may result in
loaders, savers and operators being loaded into chip memory, which is dead
slow on an accelerated Amiga.  With ADProRunner you can easily control
ADPro's memory usage each time you run it.
