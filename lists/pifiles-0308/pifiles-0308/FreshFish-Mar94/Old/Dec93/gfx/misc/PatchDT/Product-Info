.description
A program that patches a few functions in the datatypes library in order to
speed up the Workbench screen update when using datatypes objects as
backdrops in the workbench windows.  This is only useful with graphics
cards such as the Piccolo or GVP Spectrum; you will see no speedup when
using the native Amiga graphics.  Requires 68020+ and WB3.0+.
