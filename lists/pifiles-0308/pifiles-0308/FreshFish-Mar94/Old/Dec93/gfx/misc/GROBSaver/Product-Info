A saver module for GVP's ImageFX Image Processing package.  It allows you
to save an image in Hewlett Packard's GROB (GRaphical OBject) format,
suitable to be downloaded into any of Hewlett Packard's HP48-series
calculators.  If you don't own an HP48(s,sx,g,gx) this program won't do
anything useful for you.
