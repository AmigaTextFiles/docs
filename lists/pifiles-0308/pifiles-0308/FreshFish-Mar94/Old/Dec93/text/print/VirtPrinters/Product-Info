.description
Two new printer drivers.  One shows the printer output on a screen and the
other saves it as IFF pictures.  These drivers emulate a page-mode printer,
like a laser printer.  They both support color and b&w modes.  Color mode
uses three bitplanes, while b&w uses only one.  Several density settings
available, some correspond to the Amiga's aspect ratio, but most are just 1
to 1.  Screen_Printer requires a great deal of chip ram at the higher
density settings.  Both require AmigaDOS 2.04.  Won't crash under 3.0
anymore.
