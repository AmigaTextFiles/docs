MetaFont is the name of a computer font generation system invented by Prof.
Donald E. Knuth of Stanford University.  It reads text files prepared with
`programs' that specify the outline of characters in fonts of type,
graphical symbols, or other elements for printing high quality documents.
Typesetting systems like 'TeX' make use of the font metric information
produced by MetaFont and printer drivers or screen previewers make use of
the pixel information as to where to put the `ink.' The usage of the
associated programs is described to some detail, but no introduction to the
MetaFont language itself is given.
