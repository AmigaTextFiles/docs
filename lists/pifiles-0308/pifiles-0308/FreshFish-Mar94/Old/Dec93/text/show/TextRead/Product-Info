.description
A fast but quite simple ascii reader, which was designed to replace More or
PPMore.  The text output is very fast, since the program writes directly
into it's screen memory.  The program supports printing, different
tabsizes, fonts and screen modes.  The search routines uses local.library,
if present, so the case insensitive search works in Sweden too... Requires
OS 2.04, ReqTools.library v37+ and PowerPacker.library v35+.  The two
libraries are included.  Version 37.20 release 1.04ß, an update to version
37.16 release 1.03, on disk number 767.  Example usage given with reading
the doc file, instead of using the standard "More" file reader.
