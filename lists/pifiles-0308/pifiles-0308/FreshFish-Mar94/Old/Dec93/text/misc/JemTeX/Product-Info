.description
Some programs to enable Japanese typesetting.  "fontable" produces a
Japanese file (fontable.jem) which contains all the available Japanese
fonts in a tabular style. It has to be run through "Jem2tex" which produces
the TeX-file "fontable.tex".  Finally, "jis2mf" produces .mf-sourcecode for
Metafont and affiliated tools to generate printer-fonts for TeX. jis2mf
reads the data from the jis24 bitmap-file.
