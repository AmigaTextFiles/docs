.description
Voice Command Line Interface will execute CLI commands, ARexx commands, or
ARexx Scripts by voice command.  VCLI allows you to launch multiple
applications or control any program with an ARexx capability entirely by
spoken voice command.  Many improvements requested by users are now
included.  VCLI now has its own ARexx port so that its internal options and
functions can be controlled by ARexx command.  Documentation is provided in
AmigaGuide format.  Audio digitizer support includes Perfect Sound 3, Sound
Magic (Sound Master), DSS 8, and Generic digitizers.  Runs well under
either AmigaDOS 2.0 or 3.0.
