A little WorkBench clock giving you "About" the right time! Do you remember
the good old days when you asked someone the time and they said, "It's
nearly five" and not "It's 4:57 and 28 seconds" ? Well now there is a
Workbench clock that does just that! Now able to tell the time in a number
of different European languages thanks to the efforts of Daniel Amor who
provided the idea and translations.
