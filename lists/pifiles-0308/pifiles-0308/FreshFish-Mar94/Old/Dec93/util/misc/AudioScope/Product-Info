A real-time audio spectrum analyzer for the Amiga.  AudioScope uses a 512
point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to process audio data received through
your audio digitizer to produce a high resolution display of audio signal
amplitude vs frequency.  AudioScope can be used to evaluate the frequency
content of sounds of all kinds.
