A powerful mouse-driven replacement for the shell command ASK.  ReqASK
gives you a large palette of features to customize to fit your needs, by
allowing you use ReqTools requesters from scripts.  Aside from the normal
features known from other requester ask commands such as body text,
gadgets, font and similar things, ReqASK offers you two unique special
features: Timeout (your requester will close automatically when the time
limit expires) and IDCMP (requester can close on IDCMP events such as
DISKINSERTED and DISKREMOVED).
