Allows you to monitor what the icon library is doing when you start a
program using the Workbench.  It's main use lies in discovering
undocumented ToolTypes and debugging your existing ToolTypes by watching if
the program finds them correctly.  You are also shown what icons/tooltypes
your programs look for.  Currently monitors the following functions:
FindToolType; GetIcon; GetDiskObject; MatchTool Value; GetDiskObjectNew;
PutDiskObject; GetDefDiskObject; PutDefDiskObject; PutIcon.  You can
specify which functions IconTrace should monitor.
