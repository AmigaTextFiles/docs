One of the strongest plot-programs for the Amiga.  Some of its features:
Multiple function, parametric or data plots at one time including
auto-scaling and data sorting; Cubic/basic splines; Multiple plotstyles:
lines, points, boxes and impulses; Free pointsizing, 12 pointtypes, 3
pointmodes; logarithmic scales with base 2, e or 10; Auto/custom-tic-marks;
All text is drawn using my own Vectorcharset featuring freesizing, tracking
and rotating, special characters like 'äöü$%?ß#^{}[]()' are supported, of
course.  You can have as many open displays (plots) as you want; 6
screenmodes, overscan, 16 colors; ILBM-output; Powerful online-help;
