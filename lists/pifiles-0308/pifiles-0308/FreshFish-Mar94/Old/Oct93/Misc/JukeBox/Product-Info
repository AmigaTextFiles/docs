.description
JukeBox is a program to play compact digital audio discs by emulating a
graphical user interface similar to common CD players.  It provides a
command line oriented, fully programmable ARexx user interface as well.
Works on CD-ROM players plugged to a scsi-hostadapter or CDTV.  Opens its
windows on the WorkBench (or any other public screen) and does its best to
allow a font sensitive layout.
