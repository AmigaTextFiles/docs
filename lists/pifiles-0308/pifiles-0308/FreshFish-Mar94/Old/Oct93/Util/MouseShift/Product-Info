.description
Translates the middle mouse button into the left shift key.  This allows
easy multiple selection.  Note that programs that use the middle mouse
button directly will no longer recognize it.  MouseShift requires at least
AmigaDOS 1.2 to run, but will run as a commodity under AmigaDOS 2.04 or
greater.
