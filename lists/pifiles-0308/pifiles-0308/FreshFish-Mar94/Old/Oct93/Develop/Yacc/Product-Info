This is a port of Berkeley Yacc for the Amiga.  This Yacc has been made as
compatible as possible with the AT&T Yacc, and is completely public domain.
Note that it is NOT the so-called Decus Yacc, which is/was simply a
repackaging of the proprietary AT&T Yacc.  Specialties of this version:
compiled with DICE 2.07.54R (doesn't need ixemu.library); AmigaDOS version
string; dynamic stack.  An update to the version on disk number 419.
