A Multi-Kickstart Board Project that allows the user of an Amiga 500, 2000,
or 2500 to switch between different versions of the operating system,
called Kickstart.  Some older software, and even some new software, is not
compatible with Commodore's latest version of the operating system.  This
hardware project will let you use the new version of the operating system
(it is *tons* better than 1.3 and below), and still remain compatible with
the software that won't work under the new operating system.  Revision 3.1.
