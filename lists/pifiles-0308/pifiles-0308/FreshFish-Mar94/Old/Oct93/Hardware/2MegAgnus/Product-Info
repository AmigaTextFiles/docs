The Two Meg Agnus Project increases the amount of "chip" RAM in an Amiga
500 or 2000 to 2 megabytes.  Chip RAM is where the graphics and sound data
are stored.  Even though you may have plenty of "fast" RAM, if you run out
of "chip" RAM then you will not be able to open any more windows or screens
and hence, no more programs.  Revision 5.0D
