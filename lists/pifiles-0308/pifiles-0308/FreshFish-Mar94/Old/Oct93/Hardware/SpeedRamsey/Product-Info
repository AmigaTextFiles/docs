Sets the skip bit in rev G Ramsey chips.  The skip mode speeds up RAM
access from five clocks each to four clocks each by skipping the last
cycle.  Some people call this 60-ns-mode because you need 60 ns DRAM or
faster to ensure that this works and doesn't crash your Amiga.  Requires
Rev G Ramsey chip (A4000).
