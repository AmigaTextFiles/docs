A MUI-based calculator
.description
MUIProCalc is a MUI-based calculator much like Jimmy Yang's Calc 3.0.
It still lacks the plotter, but it offers a quite flexible history
facility for inserting previously entered expressions.  Different
output formats offered and plenty of functions the user may choose
from.  Furthermore the look of the calculator may be customized.  It
offers an ARexx port, which may be used to let MUIProCalc calc from
within an editor for example.  MUIProCalc may return a TeX compa-
tible output, which may be used within a mathematical TeX environment.
Results or inputs may be copied to the Clip- board.
