UNIX style move command
.description
Moves files from here to there.  You may give as many source files as
will fit on one command line, even including patterns.  Issuing
directory names will cause Move to create a directory of the same name
within the destination directory (if not already present) and move all
the files from the source directory to the destination, with all
subdirectories.  Several command line options for specifying cloning,
verbosity, replace existing, etc.
