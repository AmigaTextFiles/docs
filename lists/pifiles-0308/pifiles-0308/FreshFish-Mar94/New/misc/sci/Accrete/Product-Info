Create random star-systems, with planets
.description
A program, originally written in Pascal for the Apple ][, that
generates random star systems based, primarily, on Stephen Dole's
work, "Habitable Planets for Man".  The output is a text file
describing the primary attributes of a star and its planets, including
density, mass, surface temperature and pressure, orbit and rotation
period and even the boiling point of water on the surface.
