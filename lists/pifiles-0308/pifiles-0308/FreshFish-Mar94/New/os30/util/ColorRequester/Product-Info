AGA Screen Color Requester
.description
The standard Amiga 3.0 Preferences Palette Requester is
very limited in that it only operates on the first eight
screen colors.  Screen Color Requester solves this prob-
lem for AGA Amigas by providing palette controls that
allow you to change, copy, swap, spread, and cycle all
individual colors of the workbench or any public screen.
You can also load and save modified screen palettes for
various applications.  If you are a programmer, you can
link the included object file with your own programs and
save yourself the work of programming a color requester
of your own.
