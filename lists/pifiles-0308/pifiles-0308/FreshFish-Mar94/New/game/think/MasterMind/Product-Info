An interesting game of guess the colors
.description
Master Mind is a simple but interesting game.  The Amiga chooses some
colors randomly and places them in a row. You have to guess not only
the colors, but also their places in the row. To do this, you guess
some colors and place them in a row as you see appropriate.  When
done, the Amiga shows you the results by way of white and black
circles.  You use this information to help make a better guess in the
next row, until you either find the correct colors and their order, or
you lose.
