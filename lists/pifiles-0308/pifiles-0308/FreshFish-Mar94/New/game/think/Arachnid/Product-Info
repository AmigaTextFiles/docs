Thinking Game
.short
A game of patience using 2 card decks
.description
The object of the game is to build a stack of cards in the same suit
from King to Ace and remove the stack from the table to the stacks
above. When all eight stacks have been built and removed, you have won
the game. A more challenging version of this is to leave all eight
stacks on the table until done instead of removing those that are
complete to the stacks above.

Arachnid	A patience game with two deck's of cards.  The object of
		the game is to build a stack of cards in the same suit,
		from King to Ace, and remove the stack from the table to
		the stacks above.  When all eight stacks have been built
		and removed, you have won the game.  A more challenging
		version of this is to leave all eight stacks on the table
		until done, instead of removing those that are complete
		to the stacks above.  Needs OS2.0, PAL interlace screen,
		and it would be nice to have a three-button-mouse.  This
		is version 1.1.  Includes source in C.
