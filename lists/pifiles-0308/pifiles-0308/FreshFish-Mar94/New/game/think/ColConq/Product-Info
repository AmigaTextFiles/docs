Space strategy game for 1 or 2 persons
.description
Colonial Conquest is a space-strategy game for one or two persons.
The basic idea and concept have been heavily influenced by the
shareware game "Conquest" and the Microprose game "Civilization".  The
aim of the game is to spread your civilization through the 26
earth-like planets of the universe map and to defend it from other
civilizations by building weapons and war ships.  Unfortunately - like
all half-realistic simulations and strategy games - Colonial Conquest
will reward primitive destructive behavior and colonial instincts
without leaving much room for cooperative actions and peaceful living.
Take it as a game!
