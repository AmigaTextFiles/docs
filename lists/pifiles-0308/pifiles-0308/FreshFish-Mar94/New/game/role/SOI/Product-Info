A strategy game of galactic colonization
.description
Spheres of Influence is a game of galactic colonization for one to 
eight players.  Each player has control over many variables, from the
resources and industries on planets to the equipment and cargo of space
vessels.  To set the scene, imagine that you have just assumed total rule
over the planet of your birth; in your quest for more power you turn your
attention outward--toward the planets in nearby space.
