Sound Analysis
.short
Realtime audio spectrum analyzer w/FFT
.description
AudioScope is a real-time audio spectrum analyzer for the
Amiga which uses a 512 point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
to process audio data received through your audio digitizer.
AudioScope provides a high resolution display of audio
signal amplitude vs frequency and can be used to evaluate
the frequency content of sounds of all kinds.
Now, in addition to the real-time display of signal amplitude
vs. frequency, a display option providing a continuous
scrolling color display of audio signal amplitude vs. time
vs. frequency is available.

AudioScope	AudioScope is a real-time audio spectrum analyzer for the
		Amiga which uses a 512 point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
		to process audio data received through your audio digitizer.
		AudioScope provides a high resolution display of audio
		signal amplitude vs frequency and can be used to evaluate
		the frequency content of sounds of all kinds.  This is
		version 3.0, an update to the original version on disk 543.
		Now, in addition to the real-time display of signal ampli-
		tude vs. frequency, a display option providing a continuous
		scrolling color display of audio signal amplitude vs. time
		vs. frequency is available.  AudioScope 3.0 requires Amiga-
		DOS 2.0 or higher and an accelerated Amiga because of the
		high computational load.  A 68020 or better microprocessor
		is mandatory.  AGA display is recommended.  An audio digi-
		tizer is also required.  Perfect Sound 3, Sound Magic,
		Sound Master, DSS 8 and many generic digitizers are support-
		ed.  Binary only.
