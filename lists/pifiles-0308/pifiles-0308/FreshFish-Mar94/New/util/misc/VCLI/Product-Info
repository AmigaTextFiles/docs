Control CLI by voice commands
.description
Voice Command Line Interface (VCLI) will execute CLI commands, ARexx
commands, or ARexx scripts by voice command.  VCLI allows you to launch
multiple applications or control any program with an ARexx capability
entirely by spoken voice command.  VCLI is multitasking and will run in
the background, listening for your voice command even while other
programs may be running.  VCLI also has its own ARexx port so that
internal functions and options can be controlled by ARexx command.
This new version fixes a few bugs, plugs a memory leak, improves
gadget functions by providing keyboard alternatives, and increases the
sensitivity of the voice.library recognition functions so that you don't
always have to speak so loudly.  Documentation is provided for both 
AmigaGuide and Multiview.  This is the fastest and most accurate version
of VCLI yet, and it fully supports DSS 8, Perfect Sound 3, Sound Magic
(Sound Master) and many generic audio digitizers.
