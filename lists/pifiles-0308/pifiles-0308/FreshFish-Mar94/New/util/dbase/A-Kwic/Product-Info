Allows fast keyword search of text data
.description
The A-Kwic system provides a facility where users can do keyword searches
of text data.\n
A-Kwic creates a database of text records. Each record is scanned for
keywords.\n
Once the database is created, the user uses a search program to do keyword
searches to find, and optionally display, records that match the specified
keyword(s).\n
Multiple keywords can be specified. They can be "anded" or "ored", and
"wildcard" specifiers can also be used.\n
The A-Kwic was originally developed to index "Fish Disk" content listings.
It is also handy for indexing the contents of CD-ROMs. Another use is
for companys to index customer files, based on various keywords, or to
index customer support trouble reports or product fix descriptions.
