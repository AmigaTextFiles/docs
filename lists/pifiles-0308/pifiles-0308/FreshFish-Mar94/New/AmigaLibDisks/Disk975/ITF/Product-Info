Infocom data file interpreter
.description
Amiga port of ITF4.01.  ITF stands for "Infocom Task Force"
There have been several ports of Infocom interpreters to the
Amiga, but none of this program.  The interpreter supports
v1, v2, v3 (Zork1 to Stationfall), v4 (Trinity, Bureaucracy,
etc.) and v5 (Sherlock, Beyond Zork etc.) games. This is more
than any other freely distributable interpreter.  With this
interpreter you can play ALL the games in the LTOI2 package
for the IBM PC, by copying the datafiles with CrossDOS or
similar, then just running this interpreter.  Binary only.
