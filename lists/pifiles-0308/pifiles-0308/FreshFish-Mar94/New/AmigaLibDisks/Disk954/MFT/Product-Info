Multi-Function Tool.  A little assembly program (just over 1K)
that can perform all of the following DOS commands: RENAME,
DELETE, MAKEDIR, WAIT, FILENOTE.  Useful for disks where every
byte counts and you don't want a bunch of bigger utilities
taking up room.  Current version does not support pattern
matching.
