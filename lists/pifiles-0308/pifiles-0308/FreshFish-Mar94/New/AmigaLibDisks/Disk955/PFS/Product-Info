Professional filing system for the Amiga
.description
The standard AmigaDos filesystem (OFS) is very slow.  Commodore has
tried to improve the performance of their filesystem a number of
times.  Workbench 2.0 added the fast filing system (FFS), and now,
with Workbench 3.0, we have the fast filing system with directory
caching (FFS-DC).  This makes directoryscan faster but writing to
disk and directory-operations like delete and rename are slower than
ever.  This made me decide to write a filesystem that does better.
I used all the knowledge I gained from my computer science study to
make it as good as possible.  The professional filing system (PFS)
has the following features: High performance, write: 2-3 times faster
read: 50% faster; directoryscan: 10-20 times FFS, 3 times FFS-DC;
delete/rename/protect etc: 10-20 times faster;  Other features:
full AmigaDos compatibility; upto 10% more data on a disk; better
faulttolerance; parallel access almost without performance loss;
disks NEVER get invalidated.  This version of the filesystem is for
floppy disks only.  Both double density and high density disks are
supported.  A version suitable for harddisks is being worked on and
will be available to registered users only.
