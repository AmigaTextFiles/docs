Animated Screen Blanker/Sample Player
.description
MaxonMAGIC is a completely new and unique program, which will 
make your Amiga do things you never even thought of.  When you are
not working, MaxonMAGIC will entertain you with animated and funny
screenblankers (and also save your monitor from burning in!).  In 
the full version, you can choose between 15 colorful effects, like
an aquarium with lots of fishes, a flying breakfast or a melting
workbench screen.  MaxonMAGIC will make even more impossible things
happen: your Amiga will learn to talk to you.  Doing certain actions,
will give some funny or naughty comments.  Samples can be defined 
for system functions or freely definable texts, offering infinite
combinations.  The samples have highest level of quality and can be
expanded to include your own samples.  The full version includes two
disks full of samples with many different sounds or spoken comments,
which guarentee a lot of variety!
