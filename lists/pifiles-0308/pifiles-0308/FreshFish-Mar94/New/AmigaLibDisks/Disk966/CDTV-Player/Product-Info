Plays audio CD's while multitasking
.description
A utility for all those people, who'd like to play Audio CD's while
multitasking on WorkBench.  It's an emulation of CDTV's remote
control, but is a little more sophisticated.  Allows access to the
archive even without a CDROM drive (i.e. AMIGA 500-4000), although you
can't play a CD.  Program and KARAOKE (live on-screen) included.
Recognizes CDs automatically.  Works on all CDTVs, AMIGA CD 32 and all
CD ROM emulating the cdtv.device or cd.device.
