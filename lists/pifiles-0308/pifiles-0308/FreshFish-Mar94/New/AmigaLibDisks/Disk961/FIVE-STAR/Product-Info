Demo version of a powerful prediction tool for LOTTO, POOLS, SWEEP,
DIGIT (eg 4d) and HORSE (races) systems available worldwide.  The
program uses an identical framework for all five systems but they
are run completely individually so that any number of them can
be used simultaneously.  All records, updates, predictions, bets
and results are stored separately and can be saved to disk or sent
to the printer at any time.  Binary only.
