.description
PARex is a program which allows you to process files, mostly
textfiles, whereby strings can be replaced by another, text
between two strings can be stripped, strings put in lower or
upper case.  PARex supports normal text searching, wildcard
searching, context remembering and word-only searching.
Using data scripts enables the use of an unlimited number of
such replace commands.  Each replace command can be individually
controlled.  All ASCII codes can be used in the search and
replace strings, even entrire files, dates, times,... can be
inserted in such strings.  Custom formatted hexadecimal output
is also supported.  Over twenty ready to use program scripts
are included to perform simple tasks as: converting files
between different computer systems, stripping comments from
source files, finding strings in files, converting AmigaGuide
files to normal text files,... even automatic version updating
of source files! (By the way v3.00 is about two to more than
twenty times faster than the previous versions, and is
supplied in english, german, french, and dutch!)
