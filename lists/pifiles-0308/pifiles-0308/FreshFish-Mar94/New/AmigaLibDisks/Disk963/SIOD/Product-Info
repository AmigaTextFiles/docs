Scheme (Lisp-like language) interpreter
.description
An interpreter for the algoritmic language Scheme, a dialect of LISP
developed at MIT.  Siod is a C implementation that covers a large part
of the standard and can be run with a small amount of memory (also runs
on old A500 NOT expanded).  It is the ideal tool to learn the language
or for experimenting with functional languages.
