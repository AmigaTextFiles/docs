Object oriented graphical user interface
.description
An object oriented system to create and maintain graphical user
interfaces.  From a programmer's point of view, using MUI saves a lot
of time and makes life much easier.  Thinking about complicated terms
like window resizing or font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.  On
the other hand, users of MUI based applications have the ability to
customize nearly every pixel of a program's interface according to
their personal taste.  This is part 1 of a 2 part distribution and
contains the user system.  The developers support package can be
found on disk number 968.
