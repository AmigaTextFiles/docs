.description
UUArc is an archiving system designed to enable easy transmission of
binary files/archives over communcation links only capable of using
ASCII, such as Electronic Mail.  It encodes binary files into files
containing only printable standard ASCII characters.  Written primarily
for use with GuiArc to add UUEncoding/UUDecoding facilities to it,
it takes similar command line options to other commonly used archiving
programs.
