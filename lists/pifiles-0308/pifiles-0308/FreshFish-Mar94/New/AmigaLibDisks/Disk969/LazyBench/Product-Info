Commodity for easily launching programs

A little utility for lazy people with a hard disk crammed full of
goodies which are too difficult to reach because they are buried away
in drawers inside drawers inside drawers inside drawers...  LazyBench
installs itself as a commodity, adds an item under the Workbench
"Tools" menu and waits in the background.  Use its hot key combination
to pop up its window and select an item from the list displayed, thus
launching your favourite application without messing around with
windows and drawers.  Font sensitive, Style Guide compliant and fully
configurable.
