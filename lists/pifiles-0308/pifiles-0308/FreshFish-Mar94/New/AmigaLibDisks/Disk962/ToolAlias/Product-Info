.description
Provides  a  mechanism  for rerouting specific programs to other
programs.  For example, with ToolAlias, you could reroute all references
to ':c/muchmore'  to use 'sys:utilities/ppmore' instead, so that when
browsing documents on a Fish disk, you get to use your favourite text
viewer, rather than loading the one specified in the document's ToolTypes.
