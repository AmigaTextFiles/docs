A disk partition validator (OFS or FFS)
.description
A disk partition validator that only reads your disk (no writes to
it).  Should work with any 512 byte block structured virtual or
physical disk partition which uses the Original File System (OFS) or
Fast File System (FFS).  Val will check out the disk and output error
messages and warnings according to any problems it may find on the
disk, with a reasonably concise message about what it thinks is wrong.
Val will find errors that the standard Disk-Validator will ignore,
such as a file header that points to more or less blocks than the
filesize represents.
