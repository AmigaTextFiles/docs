Find is a tool for searching disk partitions and is particularly
useful with the disk validator tool "Val" by the same author.  It
should work with any 512 byte block structured virtual or physical
disk partition i.e. it should work with any device that allows you to
do any CMD_READ of 512 bytes at multiples of 512 byte Offsets -
sequentially from any start block to any end block.  Find by-passes
the FileSystem running on the device and does direct I/O to the device
