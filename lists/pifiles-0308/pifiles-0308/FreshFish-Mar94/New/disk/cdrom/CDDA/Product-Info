Play digital audio off Sony CD drives
.description
This program replays digital audio data directly off a compact disc
using the Amiga audio hardware (in stereo where available).  A special
type of CD-ROM drive is required since this program makes use of a
vendor unique command supported by Sony drives, such as the CDU-8003A
or the Apple CD-300 drive.

Please note that due to the work involved reading and converting the
audio data music may not always play smoothly. The program will also
consume large amounts of chip memory in order to supply the player
task with a contiguous stream of data (the maximum number of sound
queue packets can be adjusted using a command line parameter).  Your
system may also experience heavy task loading since the incoming data
(more than 88K bytes per second) must be handled quickly and
efficiently in order to avoid `pops' and delays.
