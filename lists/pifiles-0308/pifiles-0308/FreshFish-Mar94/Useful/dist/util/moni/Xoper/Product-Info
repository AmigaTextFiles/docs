Very comprehensive program to monitor and control system activity.
Monitor cpu, memory usage, ports, interrupts, devices.  Close windows,
screens, show loaded fonts or last Guru code number.  Clean up memory,
flush unused libraries, devices, fonts. etc. and a whole bunch more!
Spawns its own process.  A very handy background task to have loaded.
