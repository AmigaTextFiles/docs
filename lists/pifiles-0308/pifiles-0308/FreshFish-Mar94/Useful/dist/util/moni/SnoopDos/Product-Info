.description
Monitors calls to AmigaDOS functions.  Opens a console window and
displays details of all calls made by any program on the system to the
CurrentDir(), DeleteFile(), Execute(), LoadSeg(), Lock(), and Open()
functions in the AmigaDOS library.  This can be very useful for trying
to figure out what resources a failing program is attempting to find.
