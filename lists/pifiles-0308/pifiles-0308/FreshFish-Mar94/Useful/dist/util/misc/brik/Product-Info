CLI Tool

Compute & use CRC lists to verify files
.description
A general purpose program that calculates both text and binary cyclic
redundancy codes (CRCs).  Text mode CRCs calculated by brik are
portable across systems for files that are in the usual text format on
each system.  Binary mode CRCs are portable for files that are moved
from system to system without any change.  Brik can be used to verify
and update an embedded checksum header in files.  It runs under
MS-DOS, UNIX system V, BSD UNIX, VAX/VMS, and AmigaDOS.
