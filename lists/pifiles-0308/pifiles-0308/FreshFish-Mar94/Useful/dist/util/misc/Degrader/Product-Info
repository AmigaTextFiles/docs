.description
Degrades your machine to try and get badly written programs
to work.  Allows you to block memory, add non-autoconfig
memory at reset, turn audio filter on or off, intercept
privilege violation errors, switch off cache/burst modes and
can slow down a fast machine.  Also can swap the boot drive
and force 50Hz or 60Hz.  Will do things straight away, after
one reset or after every reset.
