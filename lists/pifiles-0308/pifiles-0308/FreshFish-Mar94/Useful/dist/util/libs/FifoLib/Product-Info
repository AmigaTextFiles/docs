A general fifo library implementation
.description
FIFO: is like PIPE: but is based on fifo.library rather than its own
implementation.  Fifo.library is a general fifo library implementation
that supports named fifos, writing to a fifo from a hardware
exception, multiple readers on a fifo with each getting the same data
stream, efficient reading, and automatic or manual flow control.
Programs that require non-blocking IO can access one side of a FIFO:
connection via the fifo.library instead of the FIFO: device.
