Portable archiver with good compression
.description
Zoo is used to create and maintain collections of files in compressed
form.  It uses a Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm that gives space
savings in the range of 20% to 80% depending on the type of file data.
Zoo can store and selectively extract multiple generations of the same
file.  Data can be recovered from damaged archives by skipping the
damaged portion and locating undamaged data with the help of fiz(1).
