Amiga programming documents and examples
.description
A 5 disk distribution of one of the largest collections of documents,
examples, and utilities in C for the Amiga.  It consists of six
manuals, with more than 40 chapters, 175 fully executable examples
complete with source code, and several utilities and other goodies.

The manuals describe how to open and work with Screens, Windows,
Graphics, Gadgets, Requesters, Alerts, Menus, IDCMP, Sprites,
VSprites, AmigaDOS, Low Level Graphics Routines, etc.  They also
explain how to use your C Compiler and give you important information
about how the Amiga works and how your programs should be designed.
When unpacked, the manuals and examples nearly fill up twelve standard
Amiga floppies.
