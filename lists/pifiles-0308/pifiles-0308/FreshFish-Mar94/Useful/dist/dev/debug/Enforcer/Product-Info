Monitor for illegal memory accesses
.description
A tool to monitor illegal memory access for 68020/68851, 68030, and
68040 CPUs.  This is a completely new Enforcer from the original idea
by Bryce Nesbitt.  It contains many new and wonderful features and
options and no longer contains any exceptions for specific software.
Enforcer can now also be used with CPU or SetCPU FASTROM or most any
other MMU-Kick-start-Mapping tool.  Major new output options such as
local output, stdout, and parallel port.  Highly optimized to be as
fast as possible.  Requires V37 of the OS or better and an MMU.
