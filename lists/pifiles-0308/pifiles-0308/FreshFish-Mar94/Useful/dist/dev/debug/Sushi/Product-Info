Intercept and display output of KPrintf
.description
A tool to intercept the raw serial output of Enforcer 2.8b, MungWall,
Enforcer.megastack 26.f, and all other tool and application debugging
output that uses kprintf.  This makes it possible to use serial
debugging on a single Amiga, without interfering with attached serial
hardware such as modems and serial printers.  Sushi also provides
optional signalling and buffer access to an external display/watcher
program.
