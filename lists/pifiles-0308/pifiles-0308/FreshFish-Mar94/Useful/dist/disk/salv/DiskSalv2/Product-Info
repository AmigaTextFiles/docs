.description
A disk repair, salvage, and undelete utility for all standard disk
devices and file system types.  Has a full Intuition interface and
runs from Workbench or Shell.  It can fix most problems in-place, and
can reverse a partial or QUICK format.  It can copy out from disks
that can't be fixed due to physical damage, with a destination going
to any AmigaDOS disk device or pipe (eg, TAPE:).  In English, locale
catalogs included for Danish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian,
Finnish, and Swedish, short manuals in English and Swedish.
