Handler for block-mapped filing devices
.description
A filing system handler which implements block-mapped filing devices
such as available under Un*x.  Read and write calls are mapped to
low-level system IO operations which allow to treat devices such as
df0:, dh0:, rad:, etc. as big data files.  These `virtual' files can
be copied, read and written just like any standard AmigaDOS file.  It
is even possible to copy a whole disk with the CLI `Copy' command or
to archive disks with LhArc and the like.  Written as a supplement for
the Amiga `tar' program.
