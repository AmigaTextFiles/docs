Amiga port of UNIX text file reader
.description
A text file reader, descended from Unix "Less."  Less has features
found on no other Amiga file reader; it can use pipes, accepts
multiple filenames, and has many convenient positioning commands for
forward and backward movement, marking positions, etc.  This version
adds an option to suppress opening a new window, using the existing
CLI window instead (especially useful with an AUX: shell), and
includes some minor bug fixes.
