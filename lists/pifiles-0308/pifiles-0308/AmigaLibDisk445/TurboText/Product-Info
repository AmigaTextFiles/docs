.description
An almost fully operational demonstration copy of a new sophisticated text
editor for the Amiga.  Features many unique capabilities including an
impressive ARexx interface with over 140 commands available, full outlining
abilities, clipboard support, complete reconfigurability, recorded macros,
programmer's calculator, emulations of many popular text editors, and much
more.  This demo version does not allow saving or printing of documents and
limits the size of cut and paste operations.
