A demonstration version of the commercial game BeBop 'N Drop.  BeBop 'N
Drop is a real-time graphical arcade puzzle game, a greatly enhanced
version of the popular shareware game ObsessO-Matic.  The object is to fit
the falling pieces together in such a way as to form complete horizontal
rows, which will then disappear off of the board.  BeBop 'N Drop contains
77 different levels of play, each with a different shape board.  The game
contains over 800 different playing pieces, more than 450K of digitized
sound, and many interesting visual effects.
