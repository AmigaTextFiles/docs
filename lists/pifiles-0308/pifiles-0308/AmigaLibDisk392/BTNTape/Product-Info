.description
A "Better Than Nothing" SCSI tape device handler.  It provides flat file
access to a SCSI tape drive from application programs using simple DOS
calls to Read() and Write().  It can also be used with the Amiga TAR
utility for disk backups.  Files may span multiple tape volumes and may
start at any tape block.  This handler requires a "SCSI-direct" compatible
hard disk driver.
