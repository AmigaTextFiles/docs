Dr Gandalf (Eric J Fleischer
MD) 
.description
This is Dr. Gandalf's entry for the First Annual Badge Killer Demo Contest.
It is an interlaced HAM animation with nicely integrated sound effects.  It
is a great visual pun on the original Boing demo, but to say anymore would
ruin the effect.  Requires 1 Mb of memory.
