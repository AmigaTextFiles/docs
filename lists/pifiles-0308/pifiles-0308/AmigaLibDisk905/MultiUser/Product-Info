.description
Allows you to create a Unix-like environment where several users live
together in harmony, unable to delete each others files, unable to read
those private love-letters of other users...  And this even if several
users are working on the machine at the same time (on a terminal hooked up
to the serial port) Requires OS2.04+ and a hard drive.
