.description
A FORTRAN package (MATrix LABoratory) developed by Argonne National
Laboratories for in house use.  It provides comprehensive vector and tensor
operations in a package which may be programmed either through a macro
language or through execution of script files.  Supported functions include
sin, cos, tan, arcfunctions, upper triangular, lower triangular,
determinants, matrix multiplication, identity, hilbert matrices,
eigenvalues, eigenvectors, matrix roots, matrix products, inversion, and
more.  Amiga specific features include workbench startup, polar plots,
contour plots, enhanced plot buffer control, and algorithmic plot display
generation.  This is an update to the version on disk 267, with many bug
fixes and code reorganizations.
