.description
A program to modify executable files to allow them to run in external
memory.  It forces all DATA and BSS hunks in the file to be loaded into
CHIP memory.  CODE hunks will still load into FAST ram if available.  New
features include an interactive mode to select where each DATA or BSS hunk
will load into memory, support for overlays, support for AC BASIC compiled
programs, and support for new hunk types as used by "blink".  This is an
update to version 1.2a on disk 36.
