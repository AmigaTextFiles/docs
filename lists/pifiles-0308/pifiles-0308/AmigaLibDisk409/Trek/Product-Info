.description
An excellent shareware Star Trek game.  The object of the game is to stay
alive, healthy, and maintain the Enterprise in good condition.  As Captain
of the ship, you must go on missions where you show your common sense and
level headedness.  An overly cautious Captain will loose his ship as well
as a careless or irrational Captain.  This distribution unpacks into two
almost full disks.
