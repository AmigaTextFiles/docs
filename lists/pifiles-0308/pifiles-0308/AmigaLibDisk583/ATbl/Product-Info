.description
A program for table formatting, somehow inspired by the "tbl" utility on
UNIX systems. Can produce printer output, with IBM graphics characters, or
a regular IFF ILBM file which can be read by any decent desktop-publishing
or word-processor program.  With English and French documentation.
