Convert ILBM To Assembler Source.  CITAS allows one to easily put graphics
into his/her own programs.  CITAS takes a standard IFF ILBM image file and
converts it into either assembler or 'C' source code.  Designed for blitter
image control, all of the necessary labels are generated, along with color
map information, mask generation, and other options.
