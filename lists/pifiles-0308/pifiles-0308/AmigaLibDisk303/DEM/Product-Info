.description
A program to compute mandelbrots via the Distance Estimator Method, as
described in the book "The Science of Fractal Images" by H. O. Pietgen and
D. Saupe.  It is used to make high resolution black-and-white images.  This
is a batch mode type program so several images can be generated, one after
the other, without any human interaction.
