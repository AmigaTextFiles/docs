.description
Allows one to send alpha-numeric (i.e., full text) messages to a pager from
an Amiga.  This is accomplished by dialing into an IXO protocol compliant
pager central and uploading messages.  Features include: Alias file for
commonly paged people to be referred to by name rather than cryptic PIN
numbers; "Groups" file allowing messages to be easily sent to many people
working on the same project, in the same department, etc; Supports multiple
pager centrals through a services configuration file; Full logging of
messages spooled, dialout attempts, etc.  Includes sample rexx scripts to
generating automatic messages, paging the current person on duty, etc.
