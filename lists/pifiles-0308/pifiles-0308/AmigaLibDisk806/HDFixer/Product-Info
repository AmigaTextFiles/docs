.description
Some of the newer A3000's have high density floppy drives. In the 37.175
version of Kickstart, HD disks are not completely supported in HD mode.
This program patches the system so that Kickstart V37.175 owners are able
to use 1.71 MB HD disks.  This very user friendly, totally new programmed
version, comes as a Commodity and supports the new OS2.x functions like
Public Screens, scaleable fonts, shortcut gadget activation and so on.
Requires Workbench 2.04.
