.description
ArJay Genealogist is a specialised database for keeping track of genealogical
information. It features a full, easy to use, Intuition interface with key
short-cuts for most gadgets. The programme is totally non-sexist and secular
in nature, and correctly handles multiple marriages, "unconventional"
marriages, adopted children, and unmarried parents. The printed reports
include descendant and pedigree charts, personal details reports, family
group sheets, and index lists of people and families. Free-form note files
can be created using any editor, and IFF pictures can be viewed using any
IFF viewer, from within the programme. Other features include dynamic
on-screen ancestor and descendant charts, extensive on-line
context-sensitive help (using "AmigaGuide", (c) Commodore Business Machines),
flexible "regular expression" searching, and multiple ARexx ports with
extensive command set. Up to 1000 people per database, with databases held
in RAM for maximum speed and responsiveness.
