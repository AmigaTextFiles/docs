Nicely done task-handling program allowing you to put to sleep, kill or
change priorities of the all the currently loaded tasks.  Also potentially
GURU-producing, so be careful what tasks you kill, change priorities of,
etc.  Handy window sizer will reduce it almost to an icon to hang around
until you want to use it.
