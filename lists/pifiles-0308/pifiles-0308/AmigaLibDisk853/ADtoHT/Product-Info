Convert autodocs to AmigaGuide format
.description
Converts autodoc files to AmigaGuide format, creating links
to referenced functions (both within the same autodoc
file and to other files) and structures (i.e. links into
the include-files). As a result, it is very easy to read
the converted autodocs.

I recommend that you do not use this version of ADtoHT, although it probably
does work well for you. Use the current version available on aminet (today,
Feb 19, 1994: version 1.3). Currently I intend to completely rewrite this
program since the source is pretty messed up, and some things are not really
useful the way they are implemented now (reading xref files). However, I have
not yet started to work on version 2.0, and I don't know when I will start
working on it.
