.description
Mult reads the input comparing adjacent lines.  In the normal case, the
second and succeeding copies of repeated lines are output, and the
remainder of the lines are removed.  Repeated lines must be adjacent in
order to be found.  Options are present to output the first of multiple
lines, for comparing adjacent lines by field only, and for specifying the
field separator character.  Kind of the opposite of the Unix "uniq"
program.
