.description
Demonstrates use of the Audio functions in the ROM to produce four voice
sound.  It uses a simple waveform (sawtooth) with no amplitude control (ie,
envelope) or frequency variation (ie, vibrato), but these can be easily
implemented.  Also includes considerable documentation on audio device.
