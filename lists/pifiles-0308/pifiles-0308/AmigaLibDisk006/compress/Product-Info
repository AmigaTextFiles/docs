.description
Compress reduces the size of the named files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv
coding.  The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the
input, the number of bits per code, and the distribution of common
substrings.  Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by
50-60%.  Compression is generally much better then that achieved by Huffman
coding (as used in "pack") or adaptive Huffman coding (as used in
"compact"), and takes less time to compute.  Great for saving disk space,
or reducing transmission time over phone lines! Also includes "btoa" and
"atob" for converting binary files to ascii, and then back to binary (for
transmission over links that do not support 8 bits).
