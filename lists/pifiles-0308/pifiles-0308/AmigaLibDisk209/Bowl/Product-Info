This is Vern's entry for the 1988 Badge Killer Demo Contest.  It is a
Sculpt-Animate animation that shows three colored balls flying in circles
above a mirrored bowl.  Rendering the animation took about 2 weeks.
Distributed in zoo format because of its size (zoo program included for
easy unpacking).
