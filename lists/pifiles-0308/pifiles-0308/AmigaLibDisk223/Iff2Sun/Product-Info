A small utility for those of you who may have access to a Sun workstation.
Takes an Amiga IFF file and converts it to a Sun rasterfile format.  This
version is an update to the version released on disk 174, with better
parsing, support for HAM mode, and some bug fixes.  Source only, as the
program needs to be re-compiled and run from a Sun.
