Knit
.description
Converts an IFF picture (8-colors or less) into a knitting
pattern.  For a specified stitch size, Knit will tell you
how many stitches per row are needed and how many rows are
used.  Knit bases all of its calculations on the size of a
standard monitor screen which means that your finished knit-
ting should be about the size of your screen.  (Thus, if you
have a extra large or small monitor, you may need to make
adjustments.)
