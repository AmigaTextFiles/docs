An Ultima clone that takes your character through a simple but deadly
fantasy world where you get to slaughter monsters, talk with the
inhabitants of fully populated towns, embark on royal quests, purchase a
plethora of weapons, cast spells, and otherwise occupy yourself while your
computer is engaged in more important business.
