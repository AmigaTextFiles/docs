.description
A dynamic memory thrasher for the Amiga.  FragIt randomly allocates and
deallocates psuedo-random size values of memory, ranging from 16 bytes to
50000 bytes by default.  The result is an allocation nightmare, thousands
of memory fragments are being created and destroyed continuously.  This
puts stress on the memory allocation routines of an application undergoing
testing by simulating a very busy, highly fragmented memory environment.
Featuring many bug fixes, a full intuition interface, configuration
settings via the icon, and more.
