Three replacements for the standard C startup files, Astartup.obj and
LStartup.obj.  The options include (1) BothStartup.obj, for WorkBench
programs or CLI programs with or without command line parameters, (2)
WBStartup.obj, for WorkBench programs or CLI programs that require no
command line parameters, and (3) CLIStartup.obj, for CLI programs that
require command line parameters but do not need to be able to be runnable
from WorkBench.
