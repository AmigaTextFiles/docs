A program for creating active index/selector pages to replace the normal
window/icon display.  Appearance of pages is only limited by the
capabilities of your paint program and your imagination.  Index lines can
be shown as arrays of boxes (as with current "selector" programs), or as
icon look-alikes, or anything else you fancy, with normally a large saving
in disk space.
