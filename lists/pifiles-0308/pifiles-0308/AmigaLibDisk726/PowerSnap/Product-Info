.description
A utility that allows you to use the mouse to mark characters anywhere on
the screen, and then paste them somewhere else, such as in another CLI or
in a string gadget.  Checks what font is used in the window you snap from
and will look for the position of the characters automatically.  Recognizes
all non proportional fonts of up to 24 pixels wide and of any height.
Works with AmigaDOS 2.0 in both shell and WorkBench environments.
