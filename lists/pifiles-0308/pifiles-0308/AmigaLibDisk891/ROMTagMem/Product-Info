.description
Adds non-autoconfig memory as early as possible to the memory
list.  In situations where you have only CHIP memory and non-
autoconfig memory, your system will run faster and have more
CHIP memory available if as many system structures as possible
are not in CHIP memory.
.short
Add non-autoconfig memory.
.exectype
Binary only.
