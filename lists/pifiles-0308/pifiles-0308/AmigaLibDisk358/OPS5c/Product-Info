.description
OPS5c is a compiler for the expert system language OPS5.  The compiler
takes OPS5 source code as input and creates a C source code file to be
compiled to create an executable.  Arbitrary C code may be linked with the
executable and executed as a result of firing rules.  The system's strong
point is its speed and as a result it sometimes has large executables and
large memory requirements.  At least 1 Meg.  of memory is suggested.
Binaries only for compiler and run-time library.  Requires a C compiler.
