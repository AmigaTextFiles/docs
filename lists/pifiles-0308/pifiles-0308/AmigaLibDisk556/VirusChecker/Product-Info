A virus checker that can check memory, disk bootblocks, and all disk files
for signs of most known viruses.  Can remember nonstandard bootblocks that
you indicate are OK and not bother you about them again.  Includes an ARexx
port, supports SHI's Bootblock.library.  By using this library and its
brainfile you have the ability to add new Bootblock viruses as SHI release
new brainfiles.
