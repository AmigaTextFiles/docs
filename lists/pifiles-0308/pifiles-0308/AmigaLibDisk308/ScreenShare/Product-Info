.description
A library and support programs that enable applications to open up windows
on other applications' custom screens.  For example, your editor may want
to open a window on your terminal emulator's screen so you can compose a
message while still being able to see the contents of the terminal's
screen.  Both applications must cooperate for the screen sharing to work.
For interface portions.
