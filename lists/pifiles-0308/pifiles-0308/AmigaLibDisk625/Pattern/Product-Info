.description
A shared library which matches AmigaDOS patterns with strings and converts
strings into uppercase or lowercase, including umlauts.  The library works
with Kickstart V1.2 and higher and the pattern matching routines are
compatible with ARP and AmigaDOS 2.0 pattern matching.  An ARexx function
library is also available.  One of the external programs included in this
package is pgrep version 0.4, a small grep command, that finds a string or
an AmigaDOS pattern in one or several files, or in stdin (default).
