This package is a replacement of the old Aquarium program.  NewFish,
NewAqua and CliAqua support a packed database but are also compatible with
the old (unpacked) database. The entire package supports a user
configurable database path.  CliAqua has the same functions as NewAqua, but
is controlled via CLI.  It has an interface to install on a BBS.  AquaPack
is written in SAS-C.  NewFish is version 2.71, NewAqua is version 1.01, and
CliAqua is version 1.01.  Source is available from the author.
