Extremely useful shareware recoverable ram disk.  This AmigaDOS device
driver implements a completely DOS compatible disk device in memory that
survives resets, guru's, and crashes.  An absolute must for those with lots
of ram.  This is an update to the version released on disk 58.  It now
works with up to 8Mb of memory.  It was rewritten in assembly and is now
faster and much smaller.
