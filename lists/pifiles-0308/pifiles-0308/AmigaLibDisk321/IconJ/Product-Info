.description
IconJ significantly enhances the IconX program, and is 100% compatible.  It
allows scripts to be executed by double-clicking the script's icon.
Abilities include joining the script with the icon file itself, or calling
it from any directory or disk, executing either AmigaDOS or ARexx scripts,
outputing to any file or device, running interactive scripts and scripts
that contain conditionals, and creating relative console windows.  Includes
a utility called AtatJ which attaches or detaches a script to/from an icon
file.
