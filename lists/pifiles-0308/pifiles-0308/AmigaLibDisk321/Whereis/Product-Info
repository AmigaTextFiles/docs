.description
Another "find-that-file" utility.  Whereis searches on your (hard-)disk for
a file(name) and displays the path to that file.  Some features are case
independent search, wildcards, interactive mode (cd implemented), can
display size and date of files, always abortable, can archive filenames for
"ZOO" (like fnams/recurdir), and no recursive procedures.
