.description
Yet another virus killer.  BootX can check the bootblock of a disk, check
memory for any resident viruses, and scan a disk for link viruses.  It can
load bootblock libraries for you to write on your disks as an alternative
for the boring DOS install bootblock.  It can load brain files so you can
add any new bootblocks that BootX does not yet recognize.  BootX is written
completely in assembly for maximum speed and minimum size.  Fully supports
AmigaDOS 2.0.
