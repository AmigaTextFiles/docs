This is a hardware/software project to allow the Amiga to read an infrared
remote control via the parallel port.  Includes an ILBM of the schematic
for a simple interface to the A1000 parallel port, some modifications are
needed for other Amigas.  The source code and executable for a reader
program are included.  For further functionality modifications to the
source can be performed.
