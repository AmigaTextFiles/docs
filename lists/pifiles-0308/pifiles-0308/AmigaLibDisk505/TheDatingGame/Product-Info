A very well done animation by Eric Schwartz.  This is Eric's biggest
animation project to date.  The animation lasts nearly 4 minutes and
requires 3 MB of RAM to run.  Flip the Frog has all kinds of trouble
getting to the house of his girlfriend, Clarisse Cat.  This cartoon
animation follows the style of the short theatrical cartoons of earlier
days.  The animation unpacks to two floppies.
