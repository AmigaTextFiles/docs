Window Iconification tools
.description
A program, and number of companion utilities, that allow you to
iconify windows on any screen, including custom screens. Iconified
windows become small icons on the bottom of the screen, and they can
be opened again by double-clicking them.  Also allows any screen to
become a shared, WorkBench-like screen, and gives you the ability to
create new screens specifically for this purpose.  Each window can
have its own custom icon.  There is a programmers interface to allow
programs to control their own icons.
