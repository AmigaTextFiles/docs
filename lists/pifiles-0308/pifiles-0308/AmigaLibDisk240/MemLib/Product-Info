.description
A link library of routines to aid in debugging memory problems.  Works with
Lattice C 5.0 and possibly with earlier versions.  It's features include
trashing all allocated memory, trashing all freed memory, keeping track of
freed memory with notification if it is written to, notification of memory
freed twice or not at all, notification of overrunning or underrunning
allocated memory, generation of low memory conditions for testing purposes,
and identification of violations of memory use by filename and line number
of the allocating routine.
