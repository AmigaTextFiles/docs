.description
A small system patch and replacement for the standard CLI commands 'assign'
and 'path'.  With AddAssign, you may assign a logical device (like 'C:' to
one OR MORE physical devices or directories).  AddAssign is especially
useful for programs which need a library or something else in a specified
path, but you don't want them to be there.
