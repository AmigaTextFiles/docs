.description
PickPacket gives you a visual display of the DosPacket structures that are
sent to handlers, and lets you see the results.  You can actually perform
handler operations such as open files, read or write data, Examine or
ExNext locks, and so forth, all by talking directly to the file system
handler involved using PickPacket.
