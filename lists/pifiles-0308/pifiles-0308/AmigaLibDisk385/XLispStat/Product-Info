.description
A statistical program based on David Betz' XLisp. It does some of the most
advanced dynamic statistical graphics, included brushing, linking, and 3D
rotations.  Menus and requestors can be created dynamically with simple
lisp commands, and treated as lisp objects, so that the program could be
used for many other nonstatistical purposes, such as interactive expert
systems. XLisp-Stat has an ARexx port so that an editor may be used to
prepare lisp programs and send them directly to XLisp-Stat to be executed.
Commands, as character strings, may also be sent from XLisp-Stat with the
lisp command, "arexx".  All graphics produced may be saved to files in IFF
format.  This version of XLisp-Stat (v.2.1, release 1) has been ported to
the Amiga by James Lindsey, from the Mac version supplied by Luke Tierney.
Requires a numerical coprocessor (M68881/M68882) and an M68020/M68030
processor.  This disk contains the executables, manual, and lisp files.
The sources can be found on disk 386.
