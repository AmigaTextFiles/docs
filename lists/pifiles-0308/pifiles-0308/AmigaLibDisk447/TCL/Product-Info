Port of Tool Command Language, a simple textual language intended primarily
for issuing commands to interactive programs such as text editors,
debuggers, illustrators, shells, etc.  It has a simple syntax and is
programmable so TCL users can write command procedures to provide more
powerful commands than those in the built in set.  Alpha 2 version.
