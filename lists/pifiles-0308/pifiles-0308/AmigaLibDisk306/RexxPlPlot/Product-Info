.description
A library of C functions useful for scientific plotting on the Amiga.  The
library is Lattice C compatible.  Contour plotting, three dimensional
plotting, axis redefinition, log-log plotting and multiple subpages are a
few of Plplot's features.  The plots can be displayed on a monitor or sent
to a graphics file for subsequent printing.  This is RexxPlPlot version
0.3, an update to Plplot version 1.00 on disk 222.  New features include an
ARexx interface, support for IFF output, support for PostScript output,
support for Preferences, some new functions, bug fixes, and more.
