Another of Peter's innovative and addictive games.  Sort of a
"video-bowling" concept where the object is to wipe out groups of
"computerized" symbols in such a fashion that the last item hit becomes the
target for the next ball (with a few tricks of course!).  Lots of levels
and the usual level editor that accompanies most of Peter's games.
