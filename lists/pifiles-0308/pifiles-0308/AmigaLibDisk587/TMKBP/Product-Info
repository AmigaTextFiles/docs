The Multi-Kickstart Board Project lets you build a Kickstart ROM switcher
compatible with the Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000. It will hold up to 3 versions
of Kickstart, and can be switched between via an external switch.  If
software does not work under kickstart 2.0, simply flip the switch and
reboot under 1.3.  It includes full step-by-step documentation, as well as
schematics, and diagrams.  This is revision 3.1.
