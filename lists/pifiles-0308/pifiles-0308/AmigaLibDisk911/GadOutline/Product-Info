A shared library intended to provide programmers with a means of describing
the general layout of a GUI in a font-independant manner, taking care of
the details of determining the exact placement of the individual elements
of the display and the drudgery of creating and managing all of the
gadgets.  In addition, it provides a very generalized mechanism for
tracking the state of all of its gadgets to support automatic resizing and
closing and opening of a window without loss of context.  Includes
automatic hotkey support and a vector based drawing module that can be used
for everything from drawing frames around groups of gadgets to creating
custom images for BOOPSI gadgets.  Includes the library, programmer support
files and some examples.
