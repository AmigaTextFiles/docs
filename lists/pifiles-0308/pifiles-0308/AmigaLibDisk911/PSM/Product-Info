Yet Another Public Screen Program.  It was primarily written as a
demonstration of the gadoutline.library, and is thus currently very
GUIcentric it does no command line parsing for CLI users or even look at
its Workbench tooltypes.  On the other hand, it does have a very
sophisticated multi-window user interface and allows almost complete
control over the creation of screens.
