A significantly enhanced version of microemacs based on the version 30
release posted to usenet's mod.sources newsgroup.  Previous versions of
microemacs released on these disks derived from very old version of
microemacs.  Since that old release, the author has cleaned up lots of
loose ends and restructured major parts of the code.  Other people have
already added support for termcap, ports to other machines and operating
systems, and a limited GNU emacs compatibility option.
