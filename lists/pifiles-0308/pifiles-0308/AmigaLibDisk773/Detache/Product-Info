A very small and simple utility that will detache a file from the file
system.  Note that this is completely different than deleting a file.  In
particular, Detache works even if the file system did not restart properly
because of a failed validation.  This happens rather frequently if the
Amiga crashes during a write on a hard disk partition: you get the dreaded
"checksum error on block xxx" requester, and no writes are allowed to the
partition.  If you know the name of the guilty file (the file the faulty
block belongs to) you can simply detache it, and the file system will be
happy to restart.  Requires OS2.04.
