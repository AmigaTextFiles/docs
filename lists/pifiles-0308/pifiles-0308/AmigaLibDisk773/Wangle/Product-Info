Very addictive "sliding-block" single player strategy game.  The object is
to group four smaller squares of the same color together in such a way as
to form a larger square.  Once started in a direction, blocks slide until
they hit another block, a wall, or in some cases, fall through the floor!
Includes 50 levels and a level editor.
