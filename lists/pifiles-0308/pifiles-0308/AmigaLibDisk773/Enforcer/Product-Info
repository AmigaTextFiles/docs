.description
A tool to monitor illegal memory access for 68020/68851, 68030, and 68040
CPUs.  This is a completely new Enforcer from the original idea by Bryce
Nesbitt.  It contains many new and wonderful features and options and no
longer contains any exceptions for specific software.  Enforcer can now
also be used with CPU or SetCPU FASTROM or most any other
MMU-Kickstart-Mapping tool.  Major new output options such as local output,
stdout, and parallel port.  Highly optimized to be as fast as possible.
Containing a bug fix to version 37.25 on disk number 754.  Requires V37 of
the OS or better and an MMU.
