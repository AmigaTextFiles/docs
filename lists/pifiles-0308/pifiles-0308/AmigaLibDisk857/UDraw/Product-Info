.description
A drafting tool that is bitmap oriented rather than object oriented.  The
original intent with UDraw was to provide a mechanism for the rapid drawing
of schematic diagrams.  However, UDraw has applications beyond this
original intent.  Makes heavy use of "clip boards", files which contain
clips of various items that are displayed simultaneously but behind the
work area, parts of which can be lifted off and pasted to the working
screen.
