This shareware program, submitted by the author, is an Intuition objects
iconifier.  Version 1.0 is limited to iconifying windows, which is still
very handy.  It adds a new "iconify gadget" to each window, that when
clicked on, iconifies the window into an icon in the ram: disk.  This is
the same version as released on disk 134, but now includes the source code.
