.description
Debugging functions for programs which don't have any links to their
environment.  FarPrint consists of two major parts; a harbour process open
to receive and distribute messages and requests, and a set of C functions
to be linked into any program wishing to communicate with the FarPrint main
process.  And adds a shared library as well as linker libraries for both
Lattice and Aztec C.
