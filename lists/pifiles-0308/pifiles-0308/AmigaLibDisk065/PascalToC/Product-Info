.description
A Pascal to C translator program which is supposed to correctly handle
function, procedure, and most type declarations.  However, this quick and
dirty port didn't fare too well on even a simple little Pascal fragment
from Software Tools in Pascal.  I don't know if the problem is machine
dependencies in the code or bugs.  Looks like it could be useful with a
little more work than I have time to put into it now.
