.description
An accessory to SetCPU for use with A2620 cards or 68030 systems.  It
modifies the MMU table set up by SetCPU to selectively control caching for
each expansion card.  It's also an example of how an accessory program can
track down and modify the SetCPU MMU table without having to read all kinds
of MMU registers and figure it out for yourself.
