.description
A general purpose program that calculates both text and binary cyclic
redundancy codes (CRCs).  Text mode CRCs calculated by brik are portable
across systems for files that are in the usual text format on each system.
Binary mode CRCs are portable for files that are moved from system to
system without any change.  Brik can be used to verify and update an
embedded checksum header in files.  It runs under MS-DOS, UNIX system V,
BSD UNIX, VAX/VMS, and AmigaDOS.  This is version 2.0 and includes source.
