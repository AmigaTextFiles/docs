A nifty little database for finding those programs that you know exist
somewhere (???) in the AmigaLibDisk library.  Maintains a key-word
dictionary of the Contents descriptions that allows searching by disk
number, program title, author's name, or some other descriptive word.
Currently supports disks 1-154 with planned updates from the author.
