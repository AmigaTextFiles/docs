.description
A program designed for freelance, corporate, and broadcast television.  It
loads and displays IFF images of any resolution interchangeably from a list
file or as inputted directly (I.E. random access).  The user may easily
skip forward or backward one or more pictures in the list.  A "generic"
display is always just a few seconds away.  The program can be used "on
air" with no concern that a pull down menu will suddenly appear in the
viewable area.  It also provides for a precise cue for changing windows or
screens.  While the main purpose is to load "news windows" of 1/4 screen
size, StillStore can also handle full-sized and overscanned images.  Also
includes slide show modes and a screen positioning feature.  Stillstore is
written in the Director language from the Right Answers Group. Source
