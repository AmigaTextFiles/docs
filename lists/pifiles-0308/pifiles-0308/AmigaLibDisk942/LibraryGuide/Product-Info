LibraryGuide   
.description
An AmigaGuide file that lists about 170 different "libraries"
often found in the LIBS: directory and a simple one or two
line description of their purpose along with version info
and where to get them, etc.  May help you determine whether
or not you actually "need" some of these space-consuming
things.
