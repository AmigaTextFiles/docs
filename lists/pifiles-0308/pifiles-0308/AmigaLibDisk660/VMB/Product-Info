Demo version of Video Music Box, a program designed to provide an easy to
learn and use environment for Amiga multimedia background music
composition, while requiring no prior music compositional knowledge.  Basic
sequences are generated in many common musical styles from pre-arranged
music pattern templates and chord progressions.  Special tools provide the
ability to add new notes or parts that follow the chord progression.
Compositions can be previewed over MIDI or the internal audio, and saved as
MIDI or IFF SMUS files.
