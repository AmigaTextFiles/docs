.description
Prints a calendar of the year onto four sheets of paper. The GUI adapts
itself automatically to the actual system font.  With AmigaOS 2.1, a
localization also takes place (currently German and French).  A
configuration file with any holiday or special occasion definitions can be
chosen thru file requester or "drag and drop".  The calendar can be printed
on every printer supported from AmigaOS either with IBM graphics or ASCII
characters.  Requires at least AmigaOS 2.0.
