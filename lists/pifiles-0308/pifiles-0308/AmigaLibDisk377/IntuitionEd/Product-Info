.description
Intuition based utility that creates C source code for screen, window,
border and text structures.  IntuitionEd can also write the code for
several functions required for the opening and closing of these structures.
The code can then be compiled by either Manx and Lattice.  Donation to the
author will receive an enhanced version capable of writing gadget
structures as well.  Several samples included.
