.description
A script language that allows you to automate actions you would normally
have to do manually.  Scripit can do anything that you do manually, by
either the mouse or keyboard, by using a set of commands that instruct
Scripit to simulate specific mouse or keyboard actions.  Also has an ARexx
port, so it can be driven by ARexx allowing ARexx control over programs
that do not have ARexx ports.  Includes both a recorder to generate scripts
and a player to execute them.
