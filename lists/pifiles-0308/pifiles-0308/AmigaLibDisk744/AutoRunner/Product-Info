Automatically executes a CLI command line when you insert a disk into a
drive.  All you do is put a special tag at the beginning of a comment in
the disk's root directory.  After the comment tag, you put a normal CLI
comand line.  AutoRunner then executes this command when the disk is
inserted.  Pascal source included.
