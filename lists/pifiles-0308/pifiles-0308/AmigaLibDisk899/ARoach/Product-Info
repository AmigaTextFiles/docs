.short
Cockroaches hide under your windows!
.description
ARoach displays disgusting cockroaches on your screen.  These creepy
crawlies scamper around until they find a window to hide under.
Whenever you move or resize a window, the exposed orthopteras again
scamper for cover.  You can squish them with a mouseclick, if you want.
ARoach is based on Xroach for X-Windows.  It features a shell and and a
Workbench interface and makes use of Amiga's BOBs.

The number of bugs is given by the ROACHES option. Default is 10,
maximum is 1000.\n There is a bug that sometimes caused roaches to
stick at the lower edge of the screen. This is fixed with version
1.1.\n Under AmigaOS 3.0, there is some garbage under a window when you
move it away.  This is a bug with graphics.library and interleaved
bitmaps, I suppose.
