A quite small, and really fast multiformat moduleplayer for
OS2.0+.  Supports most moduleformats around, and  will play
all modules with the _right_ replayroutines.  The CPU usage
of this player is also really low, so it will run fine even
on a 7MHz Amiga, while doing some highspeed serial transfers.
