.description
A replacement for the UNIX "lex" (lexical analyzer generator) program that
is faster than lex, and freely redistributable.  Lexical analyzer
generators are generally used in combination with parser generators (such
as yacc or bison), to generate frontends for language compilers and other
tools.
