.description
A very powerful, user friendly and system friendly module player.  It can
handle nearly all module-formats, can read powerpacked modules, and comes
along with its own cruncher that uses the lh.library written by
Krekel/Barthel.  Has a simple to use user interface and an ARexx port.
Needs the powerpacker.library and the reqtools.library to run, both
included in the package.
