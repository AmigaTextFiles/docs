.description
Utility that uses selected icons as templates to create new icons for files
that don't have them.  It can also revise existing icons, giving them new
images, tooltypes, or positions.  It will operate on all icons in a disk or
drawer (the user decides whether it will operate recursively or not) or the
user can identify specific icons for revision.  Unlike the pseudo icons
shown by Workbench 2.0, MakeIcons creates real icons, complete with
tooltypes, stack size, and so forth.
