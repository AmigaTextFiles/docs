AnalytiCalc is a large and powerful spreadsheet program with sufficient
extra features to have some pretentions of acting as an "integrated
system". It is a virtual memory system supporting up to 18000 columns and
18000 rows, multiple equations per cell, an outlining system, built-in cell
annotation, and datafile access from any cell(s) of the sheet, plus an
array of functions not present in most commercial spreadsheets. This disk
represents the third version of an initial Amiga port of AnalytiCalc, and
as such the console interface is somewhat crude and uses a set of command
files in an externally assigned area (assigned to DK:) to handle the
function keys. A custom keymap can also be used, which was supplied in the
initial version. The program comes with complete sources, documents, and
executables, and in addition with the source code for the "auxiliary
utilities" which handle DIF format conversion and character graphics. (The
executables are not adequately tested on amiga as yet, though they work on
VAX, PDP11, and IBM PC.) AnalytiCalc for the Amiga uses files compatible
with those for AnalytiCalc on MS-DOS, VMS, or RSX-11M or IAS. An example
project planner spreadsheet is included in the distribution to show off
some of the things you can do. More example sheets will be forthcoming in
the future. AnalytiCalc also supports matrix math, FFTs, infinite
windowing, linear regression, date arithmetic, internal and external
macros, LOTS of cell addressing modes, goal seeking in up to 8 dimensions,
and more.  AnalytiCalc requires perhaps 600K of RAM memory, at least one
360K diskette drive, and AmigaDOS 1.2, plus a larger than default stack.
Display sizes supported can be up to 132 characters wide by up to 76 lines
long.
