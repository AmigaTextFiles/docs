.description
A general purpose utility that prints the program source code of almost any
language, so that (for example) the keywords are emboldened and underlined,
and the comments are italicized.  These features are adjustable by the
user, to suit individual taste.  Tabbing also is adjustable, to harmonize
with the nesting depth of a particular program.  Output may be either on
the printer, the screen, or to another file.  SimSmart may easily be
extended by the user to deal with extra languages.
