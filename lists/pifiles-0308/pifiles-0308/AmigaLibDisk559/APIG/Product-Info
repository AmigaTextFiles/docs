An ARexx external function library similar to RexxArpLib.  The APIG.LIBRARY
provides the ARexx programmer with access to most of the resident Graphic,
Intuition, and Layer library functions.  This library allows one to create
the underlying data structures that are used by the Graphic/Intuition
library functions.  These data structures are then used with other library
functions to create custom INTUITION screens and windows.  Version: 1.1.
