.description
An Amiga version of EMACS that is compatible with GNU EMACS at the command
level.  Mg is a small but powerful text editor that also runs on many other
computer systems besides the Amiga.  One of MG's major goals is to be
compatible with its "cousin" GNU Emacs, so certain features you may have
seen in other versions of MicroEmacs may work differently here, or not
exist.  Hopefully, you'll find the added features MG provides to be worth
the trouble it takes to make the switch.  As well as the commands available
on *all* systems MG supports, Amiga MG has many Amiga-specific features:
the Amiga mouse (with 24 different functions!), Intuition pull-down menus,
the Browser (a very nice way to select files), Amiga function keys, a
full-screen editing window, and support for using a different text font in
the editing window.
