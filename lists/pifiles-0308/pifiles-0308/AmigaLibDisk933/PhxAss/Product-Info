PhxAss
.description
PhxAss is a complete macro assembler, which supports the
instruction-set and addressing modes of all important Motorola
processors (MC68000,68010,68020,68030,68040,6888x and 68851).
It understands all common assembler-directives (Seka, Devpac,
Metacomco, etc.) and can generate linkable Amiga-DOS object
files or absolute code.  In both cases the user has the op-
portunity to choose between the large and small code/data-
model.  PhxAss is written entirely in assembly language and
works with Kickstart 1.2/1.3, OS2.x and OS3.x.
