To launch applications from a ListView
.description
LazyBench is a little utility for lazy people with a hard disk crammed
full of goodies which are too difficult to reach because they are buried
away in drawers inside drawers inside drawers inside drawers...
LazyBench installs itself as a commodity, adds an item under the Workbench
"Tools" menu and waits in the background. Use its hot key combination to
pop up its window, then select an item from the list displayed to launch
your favourite application with no need to mess around with windows and
drawers:  if you can click on it, LazyBench can launch it!
LazyBench is font sensitive, User Interface Style Guide compliant and fully
configurable.
