.description
This program has two uses. One is to convert numbers between decimal,
hexadecimal, binary, and ASCII and the other is to monitor and alter
addresses in memory.

MeMon is designed to be so neat and pretty that all programmers will want to
have It on their harddisk. Why?\n
  -MeMon is mouse- and FULLY keyboard driven.\n
  -MeMon uses 2.0 gadgets\n
  -MeMon reads its settings from the ToolType field.\n
  -MeMon adjust gadgets to the system font.\n
  -MeMon has a small icon and program size.\n

MeMon is a nice tool for every programmer in need of converting numbers
between different bases, needing to know what code the C character has etc.

MeMon is also a perfect tool to help in debugging or just to learn how
the hardware registers on the Amiga work.
