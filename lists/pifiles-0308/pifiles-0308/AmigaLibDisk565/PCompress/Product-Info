.description
A gimmick free and very easy to use program for most compression
requirements.  Uses the latest LZH compression algorithms and aims at the
optimum mix of efficiency/speed/ memory usage.  Can handle single files,
whole drawers, disks, or selected files or types of file within drawers and
disks.  In PACK mode it can consolidate files into less space than
whole-disk compression tools or archivers.
