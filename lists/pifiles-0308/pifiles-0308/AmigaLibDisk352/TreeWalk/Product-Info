.description
File tree walking subroutine designed to be fast, robust, and not use a lot
of any critical resource. Includes both a CLI interface to that routine the
form of a find-like utility that uses C expressions instead of Unix-like
flags, and a program to tell you if directory trees will fit on a given
disk, or how many extra blocks you'll need if they won't. Update to version
on disk 289.
