.description
DSound is an 8SVX sound sample player that plays samples directly off a
hard drive, without having to load the entire sample into memory first,
making it possible to play samples of any length even under limited memory
conditions.  This version adds sample looping, the ability to abort using
CTRLC, and the ability to prevent DSound from opening a window.
