.description
A disk recovery program for all Amiga file system devices that use either
the Amiga Standard File System or the Amiga Fast File System.  Disksalv
creates a new filesystem structure on another device, with as much data
salvaged from the original device as possible.  This is an update to the
version released on disk 177.
