.description
An object oriented system to create and maintain graphical user interfaces.
From a programmers point of view, using MUI saves a lot of time and makes
life much easier.  Thinking about complicated terms like window resizing or
font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.  On the other hand, users of MUI
based applications have the ability to customize nearly every pixel of a
program's interface according to their personal taste.  Includes developers
support package and several demos.
