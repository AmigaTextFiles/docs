.description
A much faster replacement gif.datatype, coded using the same lightning
assembler as seen in ZGif04 (only _faster_).  Main points: Very fast,
pictures usually load at the same speed as equivalent depth ILBM's! (use it
with viewtek105 for faster gif loading :); Supports almost all gifs (all
self-contained gifs); async file reading dramatically boosts floppy
performance; It's free! Requires and 020+ and OS3.0+.
