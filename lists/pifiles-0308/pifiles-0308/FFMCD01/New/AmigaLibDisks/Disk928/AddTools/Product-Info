Allows you to add your own items to the "Tools" menu of Amiga OS 2.04's
Workbench Screen.  Unlike other menu utilities, which only add the ability
to run programs by menu, AddTools can also pass them some parameters on
"the fly" in the form of icons, selected before choosing the desired menu
item.  You can also provide default values if no icons are selected, and
you can decide if the the program must be run in either synchronous or
asynchronous mode when multiple icon parameters are selected.  Requires
OS2.04+,
