.description
A powerful 'getpubname' utility, that prints the name of the default,
frontmost, or shanghai public screen to the console, or checks whether a
public screen is frontmost, or at least partially visible, or whether it
exists at all.  Any public screen may also be popped to the front.  Can
also find the public screen of an arbitrary console.  Needs Amiga-OS 2.04
or better.
