A monitor-polite ScreenBlanker and InputBlocker.  Very useful where the
(WB2.0+) Amiga resides in a public place.  Blanking is not automatically
activated by elapsed time, instead, it must be activated and de-activated
by hand.  While blanking (the program's name "Worms" will become obvious)
and all input will be blocked until the secret key combination is pressed.
