.description
A very fast, very recoverable ram drive.  It works on any Amiga using V2.04
or greater of the OS.  It maintains the remarkable recoverability of the
original VD0:, but has now been totally re-written to handle any DOS
filesystem, be named what you like and give back memory from deleted files
instantly.  Based on ASDG's 'VD0:'.
