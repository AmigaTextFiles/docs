Well, I never found a decent timecode calculator, so here is one that works
correctly (For me at any rate) with EBU and SMPTE timecodes (SMPTE
DropFrame is not currently supported).  It has clever string gadgets that
make timecode entry a breeze.  Timecode entry routines are part of the
"Diamond Edit" package which is a single frame recorder for the PAL
environment (soon for NTSC) that is a very powerful and cost effective
means of recording hires 24bit animations to video tape for playback at a
full frame rate (for professional VTRs only).  Requires OS2.x.
