.description
A console lock program which is system friendly.  Amilock is a series of
programs which demonstrates inter-process communication, as well as the use
of interrupt handlers.  The interrupt handlers are used to disable/limit
keyboard and mouse inputs, thereby allowing the console to be 'frozen'.
The mouse can still move, but no mouse clicks are possible.  Does not blank
the screen, but any blanker can be run in the background and will function
properly.
