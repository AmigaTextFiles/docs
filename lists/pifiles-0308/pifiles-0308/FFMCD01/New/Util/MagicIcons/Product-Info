Standard icons are just so boooring... After installing MagicWB I disliked
my old icons even more and I started to fiddle around with the existing
material to produce something more in line with the new 'magic' look of my
system. And this is the result.  Nothing really original, since I just took
a set of MagicWB icons, another set of my old icons and stir-fried them
using Deluxe Paint.
