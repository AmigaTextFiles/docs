.description
A tool for manipulating spT0L-systems (context free, table oriented
L-systems with stochastic productions).  Graphtal reads a file containing
an L-system description and starts the interpretation.  In addition,
graphtal is able to interpret the result graphically, producing different
kinds of output.
