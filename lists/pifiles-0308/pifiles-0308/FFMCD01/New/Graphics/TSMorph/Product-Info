A morphing package consisting of three programs: TSMorph to edit the Morph
parameters; TSMorph-render to generate the morphed images; and
TSMorph-prefs, a Preferences editor.  Morphs and Warps can be performed on
static images or a series of images.  All processing is done using 24-bit
colour internally.  Images in most ILBM formats, GIF, JPG and PPM can be
read, and ILBM 24, Greyscale (16 and 256), PPM, HAM6 and HAM8 format images
saved.  OpalVision and DCTV format files are also catered for.
