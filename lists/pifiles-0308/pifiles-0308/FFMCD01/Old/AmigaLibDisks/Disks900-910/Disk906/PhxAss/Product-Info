.description
PhxAss is a complete macro assembler, which supports the instruction-set
and addressing modes of all important Motorola processors
(MC68000,68010,68020,68030,68040,6888x and 68851).  It understands all
common assembler-directives and can generate not only linkable object-files
but also absolute code, which can be written to memory, to a file or
directly to disk using the 'trackdisk.device'.  In all cases the user has
the opportunity to choose between the large and small code/data-model.
