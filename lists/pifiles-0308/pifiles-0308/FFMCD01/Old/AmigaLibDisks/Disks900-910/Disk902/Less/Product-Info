.description
A text file reader, descended from Unix "Less." Less has features found on
no other Amiga file reader; it can use pipes, accepts multiple filenames,
and has many convenient positioning commands for forward and backward
movement, marking positions, etc.  This version adds an option to suppress
opening a new window, using the existing CLI window instead (especially
useful with an AUX: shell), and includes some minor bug fixes.  3.
