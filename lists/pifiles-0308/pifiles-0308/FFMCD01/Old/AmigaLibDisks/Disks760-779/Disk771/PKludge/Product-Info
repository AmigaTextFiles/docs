A mode promotion commodity for AmigaDos 3.0.  It allows any mode to be
promoted to any other mode.  Mode promotion keyed from the screen name or
title, and resizing and moving screens during mode promotion.  It is useful
to 1) promote all screens to a single scan rate to avoid re-syncing on
multisync monitors during screen flipping, 2) use 800x600 or higher
resolutions with some applications which don't know how to open those
screens but can otherwise handle bigger screen sizes, 3) use
PAL:Productivity 640x400 mode instead of DblNTSC:High Res Lace mode, since
the productivity mode tends to be more visible on some Amiga 4000's.
