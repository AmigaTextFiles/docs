A commodity for AmigaDos 2.04.  It isn't a public screen manager, but it is
useful when used in conjunction with one.  It is designed to make public
screens easier to use.  Whenever a new screen is brought to the front, this
screen is examined.  If it is a public screen, it is made into the default
automatically without having to explicitly do it from within a public
screen manager.  Thus, the current default public screen is always the one
which you have most recently brought to the front, and applications which
use the default public screen will appear there.
