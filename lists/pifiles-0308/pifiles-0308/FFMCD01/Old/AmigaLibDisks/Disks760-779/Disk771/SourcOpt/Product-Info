.description
A little assembly language source optimizer.  While most assemblers have
optimization, they optimize the compiled code.  One disadvantage of this
however, is when debugging code thru a disassembler or monitor, the code
you see differs from that you have written because of the optimization.  By
optimizing the source first, you can eliminate some of these differences.
CLI usage only.
