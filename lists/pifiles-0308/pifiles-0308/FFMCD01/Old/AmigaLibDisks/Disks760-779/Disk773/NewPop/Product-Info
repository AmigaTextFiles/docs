An upgrade to the original "POPCLI" by John Toebes.  Features include a
hotkey CLI (of course!), instant or timed screen blanking, a discreet
informative backdrop window in the titlebar region of the WorkBench screen
that gives the date, a rough indication of CPU usage and SCSI disk I/O and
available memory.  Also includes a runtime configuration file.
