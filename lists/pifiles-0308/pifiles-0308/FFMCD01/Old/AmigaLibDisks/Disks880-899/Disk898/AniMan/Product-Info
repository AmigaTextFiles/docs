The final version (5.2) of AniMan, the voice recognition program that
allows you to converse with an animated talking head to execute any ARexx
or CLI command.  AniMan appears as a full color animation in a miniature
window on the 3.0 Workbench screen.  AniMan is fully multitasking and runs
in the foreground or background, listening for your voice commands even
while other programs may be running.  Many improvements requested by users
are now included.  Menu operations have been improved.  Documentation is
provided in AmigaGuide format.  Audio digitizer support has been expanded
to include Perfect Sound 3, Sound Magic (Sound Master), DSS 8, and Generic
digitizers.  AniMan 5.2 requires AmigaDOS 3.0.  An update to version 5.0 on
Disk #841.
