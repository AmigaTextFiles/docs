.description
The final version (7.0) of Voice Command Line Interface (VCLI) which will
execute CLI commands, ARexx commands, or ARexx Scripts by voice command.
VCLI allows you to launch multiple applications or control any program with
an ARexx capability entirely by spoken voice command.  Many improvements
requested by users are now included.  VCLI now has its own ARexx port so
that its internal options and functions can be controlled by ARexx command.
Menu operations have been improved.  Documentation is provided in
AmigaGuide format.  Audio digitizer support has been expanded to include
Perfect Sound 3, Sound Magic (Sound Master), DSS 8, and Generic digitizers.
This is the fastest version of VCLI yet, and it runs well under either
AmigaDOS 2.0 or 3.0.
