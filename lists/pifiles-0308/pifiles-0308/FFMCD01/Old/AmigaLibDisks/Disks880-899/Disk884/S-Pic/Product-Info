.description
Turns IFF ILBM pics into completely self-contained selfdisplaying
compressed files callable from the Workbench or CLI.  As with S-Text (on
disk number #817), S-Pic will give you space-saving files which can be
distributed without having to bother about display and decompression
compatibility.  No compiling needed.
