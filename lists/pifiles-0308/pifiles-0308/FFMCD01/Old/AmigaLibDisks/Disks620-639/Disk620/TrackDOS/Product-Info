.description
A program that allows easy transfer of data between DOS, memory and
trackdisk.device.  DOS means the data contained within a file, memory means
the data contained anywhere within the memory map and trackdisk.device
means data stored on a disk not accessable with DOS (eg. bootblocks special
loader disks etc.).  The transfer of data between these three areas is not
normally easy or convenient.  TrackDos was written to overcome this.
