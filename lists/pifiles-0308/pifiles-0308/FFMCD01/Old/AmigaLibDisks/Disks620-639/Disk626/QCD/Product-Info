QuickCD is a program written in assembly to quickly change directories in
the current CLI/SHELL with the mouse and a file requester.  Ten often used
directories can be saved to a config file and quickly selected.  Any unused
entries are used to temporarily store the directories you have recently
visited, and any of these can be easily and quickly selected or saved with
the mouse or a function key.  Requires AmigaDOS V2.0x.
