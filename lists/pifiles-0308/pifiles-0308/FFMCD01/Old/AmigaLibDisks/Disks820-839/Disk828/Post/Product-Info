An excellent PostScript interpreter for the Amiga which implements the full
Adobe language.  Supports type 1 and type 3 fonts, screen output, file
output, and printer output.  In this enhanced version all AmigaDOS 1.3
compatibility has been removed to facilitate a better, more consistent user
interface using GadTools menus and GadTools gadgets, full support for and
use of ASL file requesters has been added, many bugs have been fixed, and
the source has been upgraded to work with SAS C 6.x.  Requires AmigaDOS
2.04 or later.
