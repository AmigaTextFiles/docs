.description
A screen oriented fantasy game where your goal is to grab as much treasure
as you can, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, and escape the Mazes of Menace
alive.  On the screen is a map of where you have been and what you have
seen on the current dungeon level.  As you explore more of the level, it
appears on the screen in front of you.  Nethack generates a new dungeon
every time it is played, thus even veteran players will continue to find it
entertaining and exciting.  This is part 1 of a 3 part distribution.  Part
1 contains the binary portion of the distribution.  Part 2 and part 3
contains the source portion of the distribution, and can be found on disk
823 and 824.
