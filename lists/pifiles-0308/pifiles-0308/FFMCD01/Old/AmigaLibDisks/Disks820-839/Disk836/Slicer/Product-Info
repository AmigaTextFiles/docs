.description
A program for creating abstract art based on mathematical functions, such
as the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and related abstractions (chaotic
dynamical systems).  Features include fast fixed or floating point
arithmetic, many different functions, many computation options, many
coloring and rendering options, batch mode, multi pass mode, and four
dimensional navigation.  The pictures it makes can be thought of as cross
sections or "slices" revealing the insides of solid objects.  This is
version 2.1 an update to version 2.0 on disk 634.
