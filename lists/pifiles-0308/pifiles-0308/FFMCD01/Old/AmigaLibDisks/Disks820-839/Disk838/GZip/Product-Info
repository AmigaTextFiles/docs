.description
GNU zip is a compression utility designed to be a replacement for
'compress'.  Its main advantages over compress are much better compression
and freedom from patented algorithms.  GZip currently defaults to using the
LZ77 algorithm used in zip 1.9 but can also decompress files created by
zip, compress, or pack.
