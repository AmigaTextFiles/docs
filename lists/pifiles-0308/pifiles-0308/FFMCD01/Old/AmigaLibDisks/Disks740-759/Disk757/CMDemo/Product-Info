A couple of nifty animation demos created with GVP's new standalone
morphing package CineMorph(tm).  CineMorph features the ability to warp
single images, morph between two or more images, and even morph between
moving sequences of images, with an easy-to-use interface.  Extremely fast
rendering times, and the ability to output to a variety of formats
(including direct support for HAM-E, DCTV, and generating Op-5 ANIMs).
