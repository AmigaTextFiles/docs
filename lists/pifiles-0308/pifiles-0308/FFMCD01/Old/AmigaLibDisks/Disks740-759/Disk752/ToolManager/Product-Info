ToolManager is a full featured program for either WorkBench or CLI tool
management.  Includes the ability to add menu items to the 2.x "Tools"
menu, add WorkBench icons or dock Windows.  Features multi-column docks
that automatically detect largest image size, ARexx, sound and Locale
support.  A complete overhaul since version 1.5 on disk number 551.
Complete new "object-oriented" concept and configuration is now handled by
a preferences program.  Lots of graphic images, and programmers support for
using the toolmanager.library.  Requires 2.x for full functionality
