ARexxBox, inspired by the GadToolsBox by Jan van den Baard, is a tool which
greatly simplifies the design and implementation of an ARexx interface for
a program.  Provides a graphical interface in which to enter the command
arguments and results, then creates the C source; one module containing
necessary basic functions and another containing the interface stub
routines to which you only have to add your code to.
