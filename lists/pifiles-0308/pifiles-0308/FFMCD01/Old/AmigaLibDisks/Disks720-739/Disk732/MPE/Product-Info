.description
A compiler tool for users of the M2amiga programming environment.  MPE does
the same job better than your batch file.  You can do everything with the
mouse or the right amiga key.  With this Modula-2 Programming Environment
you can compile, link, and run your program.  When there is an error, the
editor is started automatically.  You can set all switches for M2C, M2L
M2Make, M2Project, and M2LibLink.
