Part 1 of a four part demo distribution of DynaCADD from Ditek
International.  DynaCADD is a professional 2D and 3D CAD package.  This
demo is fully functional except for disabled save and export functions.
DynaCADD requires at minimum an Amiga with 1Mb of RAM and a hard drive, or
two floppy drives.  A deinterlacer of some kind is highly recommended.

disk number 1.  The files for demo disk number 2 can be found on library
disk number 604 and the files for demo disks 3 and 4 can be found on
library disk number 605.  An update to version 1.84 on disks 434 and 435,
