An easy to use CLI command that gives you control over Workbench icons.
It's main purpose is to update the look of your icons for AmigaDOS 2.0,
which can be done by swapping the colors in an icon or giving new images to
them.  Moreover, it can be used to clear an icon's absolute position in a
drawer or on Workbench.  So it is also a helpful tool if you are not yet
using AmigaDOS 2.0.
