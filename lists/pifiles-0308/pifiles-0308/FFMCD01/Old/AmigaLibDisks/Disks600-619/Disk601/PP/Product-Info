Patches AmigaDOS and makes decrunching of powerpacked files completely
transparent to any program attempting to read such files.  This means that
any program may work directly on powerpacked datafiles, without any need to
decrunch these first with PowerPacker.  A must for Powerpacker fans.  Full
source is included.
