.description
A classic arcade game of reflexes.  The graphics are based on the vector
style of the old arcade games such as Asteroids and Tempest.  The goal of
the game is to penetrate through the three rotating rings and hit the five
pointed star in the ringship at the center of the rings, while avoiding
randomly appearing mines, and the ringship firing back at you.
