.description
A simple database program using an intuition interface.  Stores, sorts and
searches for information.  Limited to 9 fields in each record.  Features
include fast sorting, search in any field, and best of all, it's really
easy to use.  Changes include improved print-outs, and now supports mailing
labels.
