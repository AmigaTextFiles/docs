Parts 3 & 4 of a four part demo distribution of DynaCADD from Ditek
International.  DynaCADD is a professional 2D and 3D CAD package.  This
demo is fully functional except for disabled save and export functions.
DynaCADD requires at minimum an Amiga with 1Mb of RAM and a hard drive, or
two floppy drives.  A de-interlacer of some kind is highly recommended.
This disk contains all the files necessary to recreate the DynaCADD demo
disk numbers 3 & 4.  The files for demo disk number 1 can be found on
library disk number 603 and the files for demo disk 2 can be found on
library disk number 604.  An update to version 1.84 on disks 434 and 435,
and now includes both 68000 and 68020/030 versions.
