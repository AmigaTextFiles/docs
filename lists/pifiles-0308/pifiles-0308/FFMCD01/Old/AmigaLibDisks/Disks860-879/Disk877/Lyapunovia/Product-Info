.description
A mindboggingly colorful program that produces fractal pictures from a
simple mathematical formula called "Lyapunov Space".  Lyapunovia pictures
vary from colorful candy to mean metal (or something), offering you
everything you ever wanted in visual representation of mathematical
abstractions.  Lyapunovia has been tested on all Amigas from WB1.2 to 3.1.
The program supports AGA graphics, floating point units, 68020+ CPUs, and
24-bit output (to 65000 x 65000 pixels!).  A zoom factor of
10,000,000,000,000,000 is possible.  An update to V1.0 on disk 784.  This
is the full program, the difference between the unregistered and the
registered version has been eliminated.
