.description
A GUI interface for Disk-Imploder (included) by A.J. Brouwer.  DImp is one
of the most efficient disk archivers available for the Amiga.  It offers 7
different levels of compression, the ability to create self-extracting
archives, MULTIPLE CYLINDER RANGES, ability to work with any floppy
compatible device (such as RAD: & FMS disks) and it can also add a textfile
to the archive that will be displayed during extraction.  Via the GUI
interface, DImp-Win will invoke DImp and tell it what to do.  DImp-Win
version 1.0, DImp version 2.27.  Requires AmigaOS 2.04+.
