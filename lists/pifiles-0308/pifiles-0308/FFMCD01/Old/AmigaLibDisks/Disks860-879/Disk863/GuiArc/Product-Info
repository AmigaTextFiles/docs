.description
A graphical user interface for cli-based archivers like lha, arc, ape, zoo,
etc.  It has the 'look & feel' of a directory tool and can perform all
basic actions on archives, such as Add, Extract, List, Test, Delete, etc.
You can enter archives as though they were directories.  You don't have to
know anything about archivers.  Fully configurable (Archivers not
included).  Requires AmigaDOS 2.0+.
