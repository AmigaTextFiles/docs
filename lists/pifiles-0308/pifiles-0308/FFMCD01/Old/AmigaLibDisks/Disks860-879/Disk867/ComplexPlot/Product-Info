.description
Allows the transformation of a drawing by a complex function.  The drawing
can be edited with the mouse (line, circle and fill modes included), and
generators for cartesic and polar nets can be used.  The freely editable
complex function then changes the drawing in many interesting ways.  Both
english and german versions are included (and some demo drawings).
