LazyBench is a utility for lazy people with a hard disk crammed full of
goodies which are difficult to reach because they are buried away in
drawers inside drawers inside drawers inside drawers...  Supports tools and
projects and both OS 1.3 and OS 2.xx versions are supplied with this
distribution.  LazyBench for the OS 1.3 opens a little window on the
Workbench screen and delivers a fully configurable menu which brings up to
30 applications at your fingertips.  LazyBench for the OS 2.xx adds an item
under the Workbench "Tools" menu, installs itself as a Commodity and waits
in the background.  Use its hot key combination to pop its window and then
select an application from a list of up to 100 applications.  Versions 1.01
(OS 1.3) and 1.04 (OS 2.xx), an update to the version 1.00 on disk number
839.
