The Disk REDucer.  This program allows the user to arrange data on a set of
disks using a best fit algorithm. If you have ever found it difficult to
figure just which files should go onto which floppy, then DRED is for you!
Most of the time (there are exceptions!) you can achieve 99% fullness of
floppies/media.  Requires kick 1.3 or 2.0.
