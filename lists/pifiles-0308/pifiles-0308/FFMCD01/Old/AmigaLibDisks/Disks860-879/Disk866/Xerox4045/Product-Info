.description
A printer driver for printers supporting the Xerox 2700 command set.  The
4045 (a hulking 8 PPM laser unit), is probably the most popular member of
this family, so it got the name.  The focus of this version was to get the
dot graphic functions working.  This appears to be working correctly as
printing from Professional Page V2.1 and Tax Break have been successful in
300X300 graphics mode.
