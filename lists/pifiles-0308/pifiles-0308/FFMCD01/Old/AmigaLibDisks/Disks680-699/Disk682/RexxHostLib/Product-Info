.description
This is a shared library package to simplify the ARexx host
creation/management procedure.  Rexx-message parsing is also included
making it possible to control ARexx from programs such as AmigaBASIC (can
you imagine AmigaBASIC controlling AmigaTeX?).  This version has been
updated for use with Kickstart 2.0.
