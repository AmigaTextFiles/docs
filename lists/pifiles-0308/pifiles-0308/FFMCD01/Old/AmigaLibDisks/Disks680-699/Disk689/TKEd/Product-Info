.description
TKEd is a very comfortable Intuition-based ASCII editor.  It can read texts
packed with PowerPacker, has user-definable menus, a comfortable
AREXX-interface with 102 commands, an interface to some errortools for
programmers, macros, undo, supports foldings, and many other features.
TKEd is reentrant and can be made resident.  It also checks itself for
linkviruses.
