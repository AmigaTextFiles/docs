.description
Some of the newer A3000's have high density floppy drives.  In the 37.175
version of kickstart, HD disks are not completely supported in HD mode.
This program patches the system so that kickstart V37.175 owners are able
to use 1.71 MB HD disks in the floppy drive.  Requires Workbench 2.04.
