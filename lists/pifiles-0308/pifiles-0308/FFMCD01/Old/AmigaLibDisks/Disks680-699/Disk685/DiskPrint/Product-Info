.description
A label database which prints and stores disk labels for 3.5" and 5.25"
disks.  Primarily created as a combined database and print utility for FD
disks, it includes easy-to-use label library functions (like printing
labels for a whole FD series in one turn or multiple print of one label)
and labels for most FD disks which are available within a few mouse clicks.
Features include a fast search routine, user-definable label layout,
different label sizes, intuition-based disk directory read-in and a lot
more.  Very configurable.  Works fine with every printer connected to the
parallel port and AmigaOS 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x.  A major update to version
3.4.3 on disk 567.  Both English (PAL & NTSC) and German versions.
