.description
An Iterated Function System fractal generator.  This one focuses on the
"Collage Theorem".  It permits you to draw an approximate outline of the
planned fractal, then create the collage directly, jigsaw-puzzle style,
from actual reduced images of the outline that you can manipulate and
deform with the mouse.  The attractors of the resultant IFS codes can be
rendered in black and white or in grayscale, and saved to IFF files.
