Disk 1 of a 5 disk distribution of one of the largest collections of
documents, examples, and utilities in C for the Amiga.  It consists of six
manuals, with more than 40 chapters, 175 fully executable examples complete
with source code, and several utilities and other goodies.  The manuals
describe how to open and work with Screens, Windows, Graphics, Gadgets,
Requesters, Alerts, Menus, IDCMP, Sprites, VSprites, AmigaDOS, Low Level
Graphics Routines, etc.  They also explain how to use your C Compiler and
give you important information about how the Amiga works and how your
programs should be designed.  When unpacked, the manuals and examples
nearly fill up twelve standard Amiga floppies.  An update to version 2.0 on
disks 456 and 457.  Because of its size, it is distributed on five library
disks, 691 through 695.
