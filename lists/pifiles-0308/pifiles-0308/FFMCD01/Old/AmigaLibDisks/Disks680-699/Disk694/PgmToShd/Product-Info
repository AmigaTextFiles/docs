Takes a standard PGM format graphics image and creates from it a PPM image
containing information to view black and white images in 151 shades of gray
instead of the Amiga's standard 16.  It uses the monochrome composite video
output jack available on the Amiga 500 and 2000, so provided you have one
of these computers and a monitor capable of receiving its input through
composite video, no modifications are required to the Amiga.  The PBMPlus
library of graphics manipulation routines is required to make use of this
program, as well as a standard IFF viewer such as Mostra.  A sample test
image is included.
