.description
New IFF code modules and examples for use with the Release 2
iffparse.library.  This code release is again 1.3 compatible (the 37.8
release was not).  This code is intended to replace the 1985 EA IFF code
modules, providing significant enhancements including support for arbitrary
display modes and overscan (2.0), clipboard load/save, centralized string
handling (for ease of localization), and simplified subroutines for
displaying, saving, and printing ILBMs.  And the 8SVX reader now plays!
