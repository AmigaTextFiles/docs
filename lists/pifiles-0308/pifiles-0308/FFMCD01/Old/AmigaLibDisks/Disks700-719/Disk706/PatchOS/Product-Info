.description
Enhances OS 2.04 with three new features: keyboard-shortcuts for menus
while a string-gadget is active, use of the star ('*') in AmigaDOS pattern
matching and input of any char by typing its ASCII-code on the numeric pad.
Requires at least AmigaOS 2.04.  Implemented as a commodity.  Includes
documentation in german and english language.
