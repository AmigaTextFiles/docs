A graphic-diagram based, interactive environment for data acquisition and
processing.  This is a freely distributable demonstration edition that has
a restricted set of modules, and cannot save things to disk, but is
otherwise fully featured.  The concept is of data packets travelling along
paths between data handling elements.  Configurations are built by placing
and connecting the desired elements on screen using the mouse.  Needs the
2.04 or later operating system and at least 1MB of memory.
