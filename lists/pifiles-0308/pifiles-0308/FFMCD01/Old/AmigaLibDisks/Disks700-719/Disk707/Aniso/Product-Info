A small puzzle game for your Workbench screen, similar to the "Brain game".
Played in a small window containing two 3 by 3 grids.  One grid is already
filled with numbers between one and four, and the other is empty.  The goal
is to form an image of the first grid by clicking on squares in the empty
grid.
