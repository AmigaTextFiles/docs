Voice Command Line Interface allows you to execute CLI or ARexx commands,
or ARexx scripts, by spoken voice command through your Perfect Sound 3,
Sound Master (Sound Magic), or Generic audio digitizer.  VCLI is completely
multitasking and will run continuously in the background, waiting to
execute your voice command even while other programs may be running.  With
VCLI you can launch multiple applications or control any program with ARexx
capability completely by spoken voice command.  VCLI is compatible with
both NTSC and PAL.  New features include the capability to load alternate
vocabulary files by spoken voice command, a choice of Amiga hardware timers
to reduce interference with other programs, and immunity of the display to
changes in system fonts.  Requires AmigaDOS 2.0.
