.description
"Drop-in" replacements for the Commodore IEEE math libraries for users with
a math coprocessor.  Since these libraries do not contain the
coprocessor-emulation code normally present, they are 60%-90% smaller than
the usual libraries.  For the same reason, however, they cannot be used
without a coprocessor.  Fixes a bug in the cmp() function.  Partial source
included.
