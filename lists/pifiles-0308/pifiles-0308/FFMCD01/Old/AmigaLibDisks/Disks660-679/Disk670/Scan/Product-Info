Program to scan file contents for matches to one or more specified
patterns.  Claimed to search hard drives twice as fast as the best search
programs currently available, and ram drives five times faster than other
programs.  Can optionally scan the contents of files in LZH and LHA
archives.  Supports searching for multiple patterns simultaneously.  Other
features include extensive wildcard support, optional inverted pattern
matching, recursive directory scanning, line search highlights of matching
words with selectable color, and more.
