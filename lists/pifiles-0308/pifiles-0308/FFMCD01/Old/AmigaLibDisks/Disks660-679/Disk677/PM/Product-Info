A tool that monitors the Amiga system's CPU usage using some hooks that are
available in 2.04 EXEC.  The program uses the high resolution EClock timer
to get real time values for the amount of time the processor spends running
tasks and the amount of time it spends between tasks (in task switch and in
sleep).
