This is version 37.9 of new IFF code modules and examples for use with the
Release 2 iffparse.library.  This code release is again 1.3 compatible (the
37.8 release was not).  This code is intended to replace the 1985 EA IFF
code modules, providing significant enhancements including support for
arbitrary display modes and overscan (2.0), clipboard load/save,
centralized string handling (for ease of localization), and simplified
subroutines for displaying, saving, and printing ILBMs.  And the 8SVX
reader now plays!
