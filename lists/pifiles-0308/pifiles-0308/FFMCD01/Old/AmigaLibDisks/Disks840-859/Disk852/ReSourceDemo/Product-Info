.description
Demo version of the commercial disassembler.  Very fast, intelligent,
interactive.  Over 900 menu functions. Most of the Amiga structure names
are available at the touch of a key (user-defined structures also
supported).  Base-relative addressing, using any address register, is
supported for disassembling C programs.  Choice of traditional 68K syntax
or the new M68000 Family syntax.  Online hypertext help.  Requires minimum
1 MB of ram, OS V1.3 or greater, and arp.library.
