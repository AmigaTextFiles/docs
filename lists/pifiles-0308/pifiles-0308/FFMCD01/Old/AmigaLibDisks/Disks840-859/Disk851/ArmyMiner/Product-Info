An utimate "XMines-type" game that integrates all of the best aspects of
the previous Amiga versions of the game.  Options include: Automatically
mark or clean the neighbours of a square; Safe start (no explosion at first
click); Safe click (gadget-like behavior for squares); Question marks (for
configuration analysis).  You can also specify your own custom board
settings.  The game has a very useful pause option, sound effects,
high-score tables and a very nice interface.  It works under OS v1.3 or
2.0, NTSC or PAL.
