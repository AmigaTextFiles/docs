.description
Part 2 of a complete RCS 5.6 port to the Amiga currently at patch level 2.
It is not related to the old RCS on Disks 281, 282 & 451, but all new and
shiny.  The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of
text files.  RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging, identification,
and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for text that is revised
frequently.  For example: programs; documentation; graphics; papers; form
letters; etc.  Included are RCS 5.6, GNU DIFF 1.15 and LP as a neat V37
line print utility.  Binaries and documentation are contained in part 1 of
the distribution on disk number 855.
