.description
A utility for all those people, who'd like to play Audio CD's while
multitasking on WorkBench.  It's an emulation of CDTV's remote control, but
is a little more sophisticated.  Allows access to the archive even without
a CDROM drive (i.e. AMIGA 500-4000), although you can't play a CD.  Program
and KARAOKE (live on-screen) included.  Recognizes CDs automatically.
