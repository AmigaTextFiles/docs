.description
AniMan combines Amiga animation, speech synthesis, and voice recognition,
to provide you with an animated talking head that will run any Amiga
program by voice command.  Ask for an Amiga program by name, and AniMan
will oblige.  If AniMan becomes impatient, you may be insulted.  AniMan
will also recite poetry if you ask nicely.  It is designed to work with the
Perfect Sound 3, Audio Master (Audio Magic), or generic audio digitizers.
Also requires 1MB of fast memory.  This is An update to version 3.2 disk
723.  New features include support for AGA and improved performance.
