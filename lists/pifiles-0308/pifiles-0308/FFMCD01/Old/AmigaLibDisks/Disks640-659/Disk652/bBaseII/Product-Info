.description
A simple database program using an intuition interface.  Stores, sorts and
searches for information.  Limited to 9 fields in each record.  Features
include fast sorting, search in any field, mailing label support, and best
of all, it's really easy to use.  Which fixes some bugs which crept into
version 5.3 on disk 609.
