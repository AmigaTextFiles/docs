.description
A package that provides an extended locking mechanism for a device/unit
pair that makes using programs like getty much easier.  Getty is a program
that sits on the serial port waiting for calls to come in.  By using
OwnDevUnit.library, a program can request that getty temporarily release
the serial port.
