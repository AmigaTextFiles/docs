.description
A compression program that produces smaller files faster than any other
current general-purpose cruncher, using LZH compression algorithms.  Can
handle single files, whole drawers, disks, or selected files or types of
file within drawers and disks.  Includes compression and decompression
object files which can be linked to your own programs to allow them to
access and output data in LZH format.  With substantial enhancements.
