.description
Parameterable Menu.  ParM allows you to build menus to run whatever program
you have on a disk.  ParM can run programs either in WorkBench or CLI mode.
This is an alternative to MyMenu which can run only when WorkBench is
loaded.  ParM can have it's own little window, can attach menus to the CLI
window you are running it from, or to the WB menus, just like MyMenu.
