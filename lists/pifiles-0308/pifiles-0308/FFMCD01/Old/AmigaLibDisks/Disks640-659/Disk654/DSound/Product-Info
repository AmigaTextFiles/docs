.description
DSound is an 8SVX sound sample player that plays samples directly off a
hard drive, without having to load the entire sample into memory first,
making it possible to play samples of any length even under limited memory
condition.  This version fixes bugs and adds support for stereo samples and
playing a mono sample out of both left and right channels.  In addition,
DSound can now be made resident.
