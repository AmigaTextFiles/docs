.description
A UNIX vi/ex editor clone.  Supports nearly all the vi/ex commands, in both
visual mode and colon mode.  Like vi/ex, elvis stores most of the text in a
temporary file, allowing it to edit files that are too large to fit in
memory, and the edit buffer can survive a power failure or crash.  Also
supports most vi ".exrc" definitions, supports user defined TERM and
TERMCAP environment variables, works over an AUX: port, supports function
keys and arrow keys, and more.
