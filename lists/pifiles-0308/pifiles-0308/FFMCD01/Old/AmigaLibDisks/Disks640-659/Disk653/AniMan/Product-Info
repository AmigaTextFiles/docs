.description
AniMan combines Amiga animation, speech synthesis, and voice recognition,
to provide you with an animated talking head that will run any Amiga
program by voice command.  Ask for an Amiga program by name, and AniMan
will oblige.  If AniMan becomes impatient, you may be insulted.  AniMan
will also recite poetry if you ask nicely.  This is Which requires only
512K chip memory and supports both the Perfect Sound 3 or Sound Master
(Sound Magic) audio digitizers.  AniMan is like nothing you've ever seen
before.
