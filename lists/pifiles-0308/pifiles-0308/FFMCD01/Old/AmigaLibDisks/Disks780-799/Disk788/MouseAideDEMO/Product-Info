A DEMO version of a "Mouse" utility which has all the standard functions:
Mouse Acceleration with threshold, window and screen manipulation by mouse
and keyboard, mouse and screen blanking, SUN (auto-activation) mouse, user
definable "hot key" command, Keyboard "String" macros, etc...  But also has
functions other "Mouse" programs do NOT, such as: Shell-Cycling, Key
Clicking, KeyClosing, Multi-Icon-Select with Mouse, Middle Mouse Button
Windowing, EZ-Date generation, Mouse Port switching, Workbench to the front
function, Freezing Mouse & Keyboard of all input, etc...  Now more 2.0x

'Super-HiRes' screen mode! Written in 100% assembly language for efficiency
in size and CPU usage.
