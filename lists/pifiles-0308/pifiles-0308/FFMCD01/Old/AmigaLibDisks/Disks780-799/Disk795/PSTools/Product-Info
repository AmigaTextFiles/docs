Part 1 of a two part distribution of DVIPS ported from a Unix environment.
DVIPS is a program that takes TeX .DVI files and converts them to
PostScript files.  If you don't have access to a PostScript printer, you
can still take advantage of the vast amount of useful documentation in TeX
.dvi or PostScript .ps format using the incredibly excellent POST program
from FF669.  This portion of the distribution contains the DVIPS binary,
source and config files; DVIPS documentation; the Adobe Font Metric Files,
TeX vf font files and LaTeX files.  Part 2 of the distribution can be found
on disk number 796.  Includes DICE C-source.
