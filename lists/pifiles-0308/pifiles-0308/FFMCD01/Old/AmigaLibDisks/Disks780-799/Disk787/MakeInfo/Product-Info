.description
A modified GNU makeinfo that allows you to easily create a AmigaGuide(R)
hypertext file from a TexInfo .tex file.  in addition to the usual plain
ASCII file and a TeX .dvi files.  This version fixes two nasty bugs:
makeinfo working on 68030 machines only, and amiga.tex not handling
correctly all foreign characters.
