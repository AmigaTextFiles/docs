REPLace EXecutable. This handy patch substitutes program names that are
about to be executed, e.g. if an icon default tool specifies ":c/MuchMore"
and you prefer to use "c:TextRead", you can have it defined as such, so you
never have to change the icon.  Intuition interface allows up to 8 such
definitions.  Compatible with all known OS versions.
