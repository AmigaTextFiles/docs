.description
A Unix ksh like shell for the Amiga.  Some of its features include command
substitution, shell functions, aliases, local variables, emacs and vi style
editing, I/O redirection, pipes, Unix wildcards, a large variety of
commands, and coexistence with scripts from other shells.  Well documented.
New features in version 2.1 include true piping between internal and
external commands, background functions, aliases, and other shell
constructs, enforcer clean, several new commands, cross filesystem file and
directory moves, and more.  Requires Amiga Dos 2.04.
