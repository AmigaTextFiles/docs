.description
A Scsi-Direct tape handler that implements fully asynchronous
double-buffered read and write operations.  If you have disk / tape drives
which support reselection then the handler will be able to operate on the
tape concurrently with disk accesses meaning that an archiver such as Tar
will not 'freeze' while tape operations are in progress.
