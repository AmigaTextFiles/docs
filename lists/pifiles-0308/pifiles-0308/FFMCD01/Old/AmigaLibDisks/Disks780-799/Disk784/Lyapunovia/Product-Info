.description
A mindboggingly colorful program that makes pictures from a simple
mathematical formula.  (And it's NOT Mandelbrot!) Lyapunovia pictures vary
from colorful candy to mean metal (or something), offering you everything
you ever wanted in visual representation of abstract nothings...  This
freely redistributable version of Lyapunovia has been thoroughly tested to
work on all Amigas.  Special registered versions with precision-extension,
optimized for bigger CPUs, and support of WB 2.0/2.1 and WB 3.0
displaymodes (all 256 colors) are available.
