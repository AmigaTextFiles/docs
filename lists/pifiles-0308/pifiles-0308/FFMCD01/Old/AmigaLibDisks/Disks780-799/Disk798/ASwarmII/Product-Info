.description
A "high security" Screenblanker commodity (will not burn-in the phosphor
even when the CPU is really busy).  Based loosely upon Jeff Buterworth's
"xswarm" for X11 Windowing System, it shows from 1-10 "wasps" beeing chased
by 1-500 "bees".  Screen will blank entirely under periods of high CPU
usage.  Requires Amiga OS 2.04 or better.
