An enhancement to IPrefs that manages three new preferences, WBPicture
allows you to display any IFF picture in the main Workbench window,
supplanting the original (and boring ;-)) WBPattern.  BusyPointer lets you
edit the clock pointer used by programs when they are busy.  You may create
an animated pointer.  Floppy provides the ability to mess with the public
fields of trackdisk, that is, the TDPF_NOCLICK flag, step delay and the
like.  Requires OS2.0.
