A set of hand-drawn "Eric-Schwartz-animation-style" pictures of a new
cartoon character.  The pictures are overscanned hires-interlace (704x480)
and are provided in 16-color, 8-color, and 4-color flavors so you can use
them for Workbench backdrop pictures.  The colors are arranged so that at
least on Workbench 2.x you will have standard looking titlebars.
