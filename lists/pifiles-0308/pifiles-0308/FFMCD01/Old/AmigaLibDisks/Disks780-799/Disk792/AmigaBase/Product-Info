.description
A hierachical, programmable, in-core database.  Features include two
display methods, filter datasets, search datasets, print datasets, and many
more.  Nearly everything can be realized by programming AmigaBase.
Datatypes can be Integer, Real, Boolean, String, Memo (Text), Date and
Time.  Number of datasets is only limited by available memory.  Lacking
documentation, (available with shareware submission) but full Intuition
interface make many operations quite obvious.  Also includes some example
projects.  Runs under OS 1.3 and 2.0.
