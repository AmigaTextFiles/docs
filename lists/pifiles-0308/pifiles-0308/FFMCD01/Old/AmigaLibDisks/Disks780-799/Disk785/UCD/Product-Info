.description
A utility for changing the current directory.  It scans a disk and builds a
file containing information about the directory structure that makes it
possible for UCD to change directory to any directory in the scanned volume
by simply naming the directory without pathname information.  UCD can keep
track of the directory structure of multiple volumes.  Now supports
wildcards.
