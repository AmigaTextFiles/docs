Small demo of a file librarian, a database for files.  The database exists
as a number of index files and disks where FileStorage puts your collection
of files.  FileStorage 'remembers' how many free bytes each storage disk
has and tries to fill the disks to the maximum.  For each file you can add
a 320 character long description and set 16 different (user definable)
filetypes.  Searching / adding / deleting / changing it's all there!
