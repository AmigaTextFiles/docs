.description
A standard Amiga shared runtime library which makes it a lot quicker and
easier to build standard requesters into your programs.  Designed with
CBM's style guidelines in mind, so that the resulting requesters have the
look and feel of AmigaDOS 2.0.  Lots of enhancements since release 1.0d on
disk 623.  Includes a demo and glue/demo sources.
