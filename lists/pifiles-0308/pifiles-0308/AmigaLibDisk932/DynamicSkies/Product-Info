A big toolbox for astronomy that has, for an ultimate goal,
to answer with speed any question that may arise on celestial
objects.  For example, suppose you have an urge to observe
Jupiter tonight from your window; You may consult rise/set
times of Jupiter, ask when it crosses south-west (supposing
your window faces south-west), and with just a mouse click
have a glance at the simulated sky at this time.  You may
even animate Jupiter's path across the sky with a time-step
animation.  Of course, if you're a real star gazer, don't
forget your binoculars or telescope for the real thing!
