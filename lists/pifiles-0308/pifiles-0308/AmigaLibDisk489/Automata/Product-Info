.description
Automata is an extremely versatile, cellular automaton simulation.
Virtually every aspect of the simulation can be altered, saved, and later
recalled.  Also supplies many powerful editing functions (such as patterns,
rotations, reflections, etc) for creating and modifying cell
configurations.  Additional features include editable icons, an immense
variety of rules from which to choose, "music" which changes as the cell
configuration changes and methods to speed execution from 3 to 60 (or more)
generations per second.
