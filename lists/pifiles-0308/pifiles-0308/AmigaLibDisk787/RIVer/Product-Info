.description
Many programs contain in their binary code an embedded version ID, which is
used by the AmigaDOS command 'Version'.  RIVer is not a replacement for
this command, but rather an extension.  RIVer enables you to add this
embedded version ID as a comment, or to print it in a table where each
field of the ID is clearly printed.
