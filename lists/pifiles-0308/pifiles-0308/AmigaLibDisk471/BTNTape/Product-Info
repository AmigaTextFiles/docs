.description
A "Better Than Nothing" SCSI tape device handler.  It provides flat file
access to a SCSI tape drive from application programs using simple DOS
calls to Read() and Write().  It can also be used with the Amiga TAR
utility for disk backups.  It requires a "SCSI-direct" compatible SCSI bus
adapter but will also work with the A2090(A).  It now supports many more
tape drives, and has some new features.
