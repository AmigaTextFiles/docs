Demo version of PONGO 1.1, a 3D dynamic modeling program that loads,
animates and transforms 3D objects in many different ways.  This demo
version only supports the IFF ANIM5 file format for animations, with the
"Save Imagine object" feature disabled.  Supports the following types of
morphing: Transcale, Taper, Shear, Rotate, Twist, Bend, Waves, Radial Bend
and Metamorph.  All transformations may be combined (i.e.  you might both
Twist and Shear an object at the same time).  Requires 1 MB ram, and a PAL
Amiga (does NOT run on NTSC computers).
