.description
A small WorkBench program that creates AmigaDOS assignments without having
to open a CLI.  Assignments may be made by specifying a complete path (as
supported by the CLI command), or by specifying a path relative to the
current directory.  This allows a program and its assigns to be moved
easily.  In addition, WBAssign can create assigns specified in the icon
files of other programs located anywhere in the system.
