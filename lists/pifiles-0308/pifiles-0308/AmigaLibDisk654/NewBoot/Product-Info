.description
A new bootblock which optionally kills all fastmem, avoids NTSC-Amigas (PAL
version only), opens the CLI-screen with the maximum size of 256 pixels
(PAL version only), installs a fast TurboFonts routine which speeds up all
_LVOText activities and changes the color during booting to show that no
virus is on disk.  All options can be skipped by pressing a mouse button.
