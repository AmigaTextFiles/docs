Four text porting utilities: StripCR -strips the CR character from the
end-of-line codes of MSDOS text files, for AmigaDOS or unix compatibility.
AddCR -converts AmigaDOS text files to MSDOS, but doesn't touch EOL codes
that are already compatible.  StripHR -strips out hard returns from a text
file, leaving paragraph formatting intact.  Useful for wordprocessors.
Reformat -re-wraps a text file to a different line length.  PD.
