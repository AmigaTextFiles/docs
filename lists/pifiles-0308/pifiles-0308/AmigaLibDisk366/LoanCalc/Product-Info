Entirely keyboard driven mortgage utility.  Although similiar programs
exist, this one is unique in that it is designed to track 'Open' mortgages
that allow any size payment to be made at any time as well as providing an
amortization table for fixed mortgages with monthly, semi-monthly,
bi-weekly and weekly payment schedules.
