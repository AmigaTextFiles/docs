.description
Head prints the start of a file (normally first ten lines) to the
Shell console. Provides a convenient means of quickly scanning files
for the correct one.  Du provides a simple way of calculating the
total size of a directory including all its sub-directories.  Cookie
prints an amusing, wise etc. saying on the Shell console. Ideal as the
final program in a startup-sequence... Includes a data file of cookies
which can be modified by the user.
