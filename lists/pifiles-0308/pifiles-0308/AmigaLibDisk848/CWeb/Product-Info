.description
A programming tool that allows you to program top down, by splitting your
program into many small, and understandable modules which `ctangle' tangles
into a compiler understandable file.  By applying `cweave' to the program
you can produce a pretty-printed listing for processing with `TeX'.  Now
with full ANSI and C++ support.
