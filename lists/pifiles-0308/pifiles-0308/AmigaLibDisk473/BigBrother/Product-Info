.description
A virus infection detection program with some optional utilities.  It runs
as a normal task and checks every 1 second the important memory locations
in the Amiga.  As a bonus, BigBrother is capable of starting a new shell,
starting script files, viewing and installing bootblocks.  All this in a
program less than 10K.  Includes assembly source.
