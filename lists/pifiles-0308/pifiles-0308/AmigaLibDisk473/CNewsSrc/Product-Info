This is part 2 of a C News distribution for the Amiga.  This part includes
all the source for C News.  Part 1 is available on disk 472 and includes
all the binary and text files necessary to set up and run C News on the
Amiga.  CNews uses UUCP, such as Matt Dillons implementation (see disks 479
and 480) or that included with this sofware's previous version (disk 319).
This package has been reworked and now includes a newsreader, AmigaRN
(Sharware).  All major (and a few minor) features of Unix C News are
implemented.  The Author refers to this as release 15-Dec-90, an update to
the orginal version on disks 318 and 319.
