Aligns Sculpt's Tumble Axis to a path.
.description
This program has several functions.  One of them is to automatically align the
tumble axes of a path so that an object follwing that path will always face the
direction of travel.  On 3D paths, the object will also bank accordingly and if
the path does a loop, so will your object.  Spinning objects are incredibly
simple to make with TAP.
 
Another function is to help one create a path for the LOCATION so that it
remains stationary relative to the object following the input path, Tumble axes
considered.  Useful for animating from a driver's point of view
 
Finally, TAP can also be used to produce an easy to read data list containing
the location of each node and the orientation of each of its tumble axes.  Very
handy if you must verify an objects path with "real-world" data.
