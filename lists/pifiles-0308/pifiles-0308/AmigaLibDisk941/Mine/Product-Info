Mine
.description
A Modula-2 implementation of an old computer game.  You have an
N * N square with mines hidden in some fields.  Your job is to
mark them with a flag as fast as possible. Contains some bug
fixes and improvements.  Most important:  now always uses the
default public screen and does not open it's own  multitasking
and-chipmem-goodbye-screen.
