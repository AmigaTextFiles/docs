.description
A tool to copy the contents of any Kickstart ROM into a file.  Note that
there are many legitimate reasons for wishing to make a file copy of a ROM
image.  I don't condone using this program for any illegal uses however.
You should be aware of the laws in your region with regard to fair use of
software, including software contained in ROMS.
