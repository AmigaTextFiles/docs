Use pc formatted disks with your Amiga.
.description
An Amiga file system handler that handles MSDOS formatted
diskettes.  You can use files on such disks in almost
exactly the same way as you use files on native AmigaDOS
disks.  This is a fully functional, read/write version,
that supports 8, 9, or 10 sector disks of 80 tracks, and
should also work on 40 track drives and hard disks with
12 or 16 bit FAT of any dimension the FAT allows.
Includes source.
