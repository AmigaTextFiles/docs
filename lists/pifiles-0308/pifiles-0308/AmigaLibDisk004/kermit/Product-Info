but it is so hacked up it doesn't matter by now 
.description
This is an absolutely ancient kermit, who's only saving grace is that it is
small and quite portable.  On the AMIGA, there is no connect mode, only
send and receive.  You must log into the remote machine via one of it's
local terminals and point it's kermit at the appropriate serial line
connected to the AMIGA.
