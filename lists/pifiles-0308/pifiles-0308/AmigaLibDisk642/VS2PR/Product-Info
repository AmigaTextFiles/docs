Converts files to and from VideoScape 3D and PageRender 3D.  It preserves
and matches colors as closely as possible, and retains surface detail
polygons from VideoScape.  Good for Video Toaster owners looking for the
more mathematical 3D objects that PageRender generates so well.  Other
features include scaling, batch processing, and a QuickRender module that
lets you preview the 3D objects in wireframe.
