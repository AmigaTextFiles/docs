Change colors of a screen
.description
A new palette tool to change the colors of the workbench or
any other public screen. The feature of this tool is its
font independance; it uses the font of the screen on which
it opens, instead of insisting on topaz 8.  Looks really
great if you use any other font than topaz on your workbench
screen.
