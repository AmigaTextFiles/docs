These two hacks make MORE more useful.  One is called V; it's a small
"pure" CLI command that acts as a front end for More, causing it to create
its own window.  Make V and More both resident! The other is Fenestrate,
which surgically alters the CON: window spec inside More enabling it to,
for instance, use ConMan features to create a borderless window on the
topmost screen (very useful with CLImax).
