For all those people who wish that their CLI windows had 25 lines of 80
characters just like an old fashioned nonwindowing computer, the answer is
here.  CLImax creates a borderless backdrop CLI window on a custom screen.
Also thrown in is MoveSys, which reassigns SYS:, C:, S:, L:, DEVS:, LIBS:,
and FONTS: to a new volume with one simple "pure" command.
