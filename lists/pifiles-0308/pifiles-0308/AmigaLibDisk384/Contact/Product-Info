Demo version of a "pop-up" program for managing personal contacts.  Allows
you to keep a name and address list along with phone numbers and comments.
Can print mailing labels with a couple of mouse clicks (supports PostScript
printers).  Names and address can be "clipped" into other programs such as
word processors, and Contact can even dial your modem for you.
