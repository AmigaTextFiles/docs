Keyboard and mouse driven mortgage utility.  Although similar programs
exist, this one is unique in that it is designed to track 'Open' mortgages
that allow any size payment to be made at any time, as well as providing a
printed amortization table for fixed mortgages with monthly, semi-monthly,
bi-weekly and weekly payment schedules.
