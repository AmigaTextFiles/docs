.description
A solution to the problem of having to continually edit your
startup-sequence to add assignments for logical variables when you add a
new program.  BindNames will read one or more files in a special directory
and then create all the logical assignments at once and it can figure out
dependencies, so it doesn't matter how you order the entries in the
file(s).  It will create directories that it can't find, such as RAM:Env
and RAM:T and will generate warnings for assignments that it can't resolve.
