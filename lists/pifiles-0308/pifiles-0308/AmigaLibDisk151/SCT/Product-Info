.description
SetColorTable (or SCT for short) is a CLI-based utility for displaying and/or
setting a screen's colors.  It will allow you to change any or all of the
colors for any screen whose "Screen Title" you know.  You can save the colors
of a screen to be restored later, or easily copy one screen's colors to another.
It works by creating an array of ColorTable entries and calling LoadRGB4.
