A VT220 terminal emulator that is close to the real VT220 terminal in both
supported facilities and user interface.  Designed primarily for connection
to VAX/VMS, it should work with any host computer with VT220 terminal
support.  Supports file transferring for ASCII files by means of DCL
commands.
