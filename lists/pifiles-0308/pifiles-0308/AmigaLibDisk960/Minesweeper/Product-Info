Minesweeper
.type
Strategy Game
.short
'Mines' type game eliminating bad luck!
.description
Yet another minesweeper game.  This one forgives the player, when he
hits a mine, if no useful inferences could be made from the exposed
information.  The element of luck is sharply reduced.  First version,
binary only.
