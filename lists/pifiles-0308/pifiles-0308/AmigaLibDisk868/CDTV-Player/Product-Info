CDTV-Player
.description
A utility for all those people, who'd like to play Audio-CD's,
while multitasking on workbench.  It's an emulation of CDTV's
remote control, but is a little more sophisticated.  Access
to the archive even without a CD-ROM-Drive (i.e. AMIGA 500-
4000), although you can't play a CD.  PROGRAM & KARAOKE (live
on-screen) included.  Recognizes CDs automatically.  AREXX-Port
for usage in other programs.
