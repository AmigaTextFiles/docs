.description
Zilog Z80 CPU emulator package for the Motorola M68000 family.  It is coded
entirely in 680x0 assembler, and is probably the fastest existing Z80
emulator for this processor family, while retaining complete generality.
It was developed on an Amiga, but should be possible to use on any
680x0-based computer without any modifications.
