Demonstration version of a professional bulletin board system. Jam-packed
with features not found on other BBS systems, EXCELSIOR! was in the
beta-test stage for over one year.  Its enthusiatic beta-testers have
helped make it a very stable system.  Very little "hands-on" maintenance is
needed to keep a system running smoothly.  However, you have complete
control over the day-to-day activity of the BBS allowing for complete
customization to your requirements.  The BBS has been tested on Amiga
1000's through Amiga 4000's.  It also runs fine under AmigaDOS Release 3+
as well.  Release 1.0.
