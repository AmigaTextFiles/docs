.description
An XPK packer sub-library that implements a high compression rate,
optimized compressor.  The compressor uses offset/len encoding with
adaptive arithmetic aftercoding for best compression results.  Its
compression rate is better than that of most other packers, e.g. lha, zoo
or powerpacker.
