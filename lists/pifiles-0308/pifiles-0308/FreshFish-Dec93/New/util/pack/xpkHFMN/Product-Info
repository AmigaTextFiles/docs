.description
A dynamic Huffman xpk compression library, a rewrite of xpkHUFF.library.
It's 100% 68000 and pc-relative & reentrant, and it's FAST, and when I say
fast, I mean REALLY fast.  It is not a replacement for HUFF but a further
library called HFMN because the algorithm used is not 100% identical to the
one of HUFF, therefore the HFMN data will not decrunch with HUFF and vice
versa.
