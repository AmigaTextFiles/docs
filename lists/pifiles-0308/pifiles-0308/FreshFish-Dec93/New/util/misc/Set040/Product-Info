A 68040 MMU Mapping & Cache Control program.  The program is now fully
capable of surviving a reboot on a KICKROM setup.  It is able to trap
attempted writes to kickstart, and completely recover and prevent the
software failure.  The various help and info options are now much easier to
remember and understand, and are also much more informative.
