A simple little utility for HP Laserjets and other printers that support
the HP-PCL language.  It's only goal in life is to print either one 166
chars x 66 line page, or two 80 x 66 line pages per sheet.  Does not go
through printer.device, but rather the output from 2Print is redirected to
a file or PAR: for faster printing.
