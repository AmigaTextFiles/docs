instructions for specific screens, give general promotion rules, promote
depending on the mode requested by the program, or depending on: the task
requesting the screen, the title of the screen or the public screen name
for the requested screen.  You can also do more than simply change the
mode, You can change the DriPens for the screens, the number of colors in
the ColorMap, and a lot more (check out the tags for OpenScreenTags, most
of them can be changed using the Promotor).
