.description
Yet another TitleBar clock that tries to look like part of your Workbench
title bar.  It actually opens a very small, nondraggable window in the
upper right corner of the screen.  HFK opens on the default public screen,
which will usually be Workbench.  HFK uses almost 0% of CPU time, as it is
written very efficiently in C, taking advantage of the timer.device, and
only once a minute to render the time.  Requires Workbench 3.0.
