Uses the V39 graphics.library function ObtainPen() to lock, or procure, a
pen.  The idea here is that you call this program from your user-startup,
so that it gets run every time you boot.  This way, you can have a standard
setup for colors beyond the eight that Palette Preferences allows.  You can
lock all available pens for exclusive use, if you wanted to.  With the pens
locked and set on startup, you can use those extra colors in Workbench
icons (though you may have to use IconEdit 2.x to get them to work in 16
colors), Dock icons, console escape colors (multicolor CLI prompts), and
other cool stuff.
