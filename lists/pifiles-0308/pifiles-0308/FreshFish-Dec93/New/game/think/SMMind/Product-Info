SuperMeisterMind is a MasterMind clone which uses colors and shapes to form
the hidden code.  This results in a completely new level of difficulty.
Features: OS 2 look; up to 7 colors and 7 shapes; code-length up to 6
symbols; almost anything may be configured by the user; online-help.
German version only, but game not difficult to figure out for those
familiar with MasterMind.
