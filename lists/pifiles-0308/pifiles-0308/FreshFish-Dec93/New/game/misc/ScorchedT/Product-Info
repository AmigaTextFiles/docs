Scorched Tanks is a tank warfare game where 2 to 4 players take turns
buying weapons and shooting them at each other.  The more damage a player
causes another, the more money they get.  The more money a player receives,
the larger the weapons they can buy.  This is a very simple concept, but
extremely addictive! Similar to a very popular game called Scorched Earth
on MS-Dos machines.
