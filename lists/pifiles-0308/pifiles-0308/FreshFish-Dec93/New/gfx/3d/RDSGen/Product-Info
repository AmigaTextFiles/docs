A "SIRDS" generator.  SIRDS are Single-Image-Random-DotStereograms and are
"real" three-dimensional pictures.  The dots (which seem random) are
calculated in such a way that if you focus "behind" the picture (monitor,
etc), you will see a 3D pic with a real feeling of "depth".  It can be hard
to see the pics the first time, but don't give up! Most people succeed in
seeing them, though it may take some time.
