Precision Imagery 
.description
A utility program that will take a series of image files (any format) and
create an image index of scaled down "thumb-nail" pictures, labelled
appropriately.  The program acts as a graphic front-end to Art Department
Professional 2.2 (or higher).  Useful for catalogging images, textures and
anim frames, allowing them to be stored off the main system.
