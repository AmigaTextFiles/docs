This program prints the contents of the frontmost screen, no matter what
depth it has or if it's a true EGS screen or a screen of an EGS workbench
emulation.  This even works if there's no EGS at all or if the screen has a
colour resolution of 24 bits (but then, only 12 bits are printed as the
printer device supports no more than that).  EGSPrint needs a lot of
memory, especially for EGS screens, and requires EGS version 6 or higher.
