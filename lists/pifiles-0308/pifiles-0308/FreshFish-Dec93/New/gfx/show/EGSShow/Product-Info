A viewing program for GIF and JPEG files on the EGS window system.  This
program is able to read the JPEG format as well as the GIF formats GIF87a,
GIF89a and all future GIF files compatible with both of the above.  The
format of the file is detected automatically.  EGSShow needs a lot of
memory for bigger pictures ( > 640 x 480) and requries EGS version 6 or
higher.
