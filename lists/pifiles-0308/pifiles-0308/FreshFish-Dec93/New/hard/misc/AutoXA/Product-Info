Loads a small program into your system that automatically adds the memory
that you have installed on a MicroBotics M1230XA card every time you
reboot, this routine survives a reboot, and makes the memory available to
the system software *much* earlier in the boot-up process.  This results in
almost all of the system's data being loaded into much faster XA memory,
rather than Chip memory.  It also frees up about 245 kilobytes of Chip
memory that graphic or music programs might need.
