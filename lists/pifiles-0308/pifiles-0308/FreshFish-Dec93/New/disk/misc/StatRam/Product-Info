.description
A very fast, very recoverable ram drive. It works on any Amiga using V2.04
or greater of the OS. It maintains the remarkable recoverability of the
original VD0:, but has now been totally re-written to handle any DOS
filesystem, be named what you like and give back memory from deleted files
instantly. Based on ASDG's 'VD0:'.
