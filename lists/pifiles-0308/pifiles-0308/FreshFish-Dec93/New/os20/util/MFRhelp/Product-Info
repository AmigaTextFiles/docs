If you are user of the great MagicFileRequester v2.0(d/e) by Stefan Stuntz
and of the new CygnusEd 3.5 you probably have noticed, that the CygnusEd
3.5 refuses to load a single file if the MagicFileRequester is installed.
Now, to get rid of this problem you can do the following things: remove the
MagicFileRequester (probably the worst idea you ever had...:-) ); open
always more than one file at the same time (not a good solution); install
MFRHelp (that would be fine!).  Includes assembler source.
