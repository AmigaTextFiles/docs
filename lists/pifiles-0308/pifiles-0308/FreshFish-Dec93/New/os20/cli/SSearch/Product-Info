.description
Does nearly the same thing as the AmigaDOS's search command but faster.
Example: searching for "foobar" in the C= Autodocs (plus some other
Autodocs, 82 files, 1937 KBytes) requires 78 seconds with search and 14
seconds with ssearch on the author's machine (A3000/030-25).  SSearch has
two additional features compared to search: you can search case sensitive,
which is even faster than case insensitive, and you can switch off printing
of file names.
