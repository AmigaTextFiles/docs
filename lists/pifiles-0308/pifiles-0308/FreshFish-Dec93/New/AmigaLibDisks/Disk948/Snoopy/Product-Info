.description
Enables you to monitor library function calls of any library you wish.  The
idea of course came from SnoopDos by Eddy Carroll, but Snoopy is different
in approach and purpose.  Snoopy has no specific patches for specific
functions it is an all-purpose tool to monitor *ANY* library call in *ANY*
system library.  Includes assembly source.
