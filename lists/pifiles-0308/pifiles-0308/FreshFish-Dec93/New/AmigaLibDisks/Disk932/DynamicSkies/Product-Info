A big toolbox for astronomy that has, for an ultimate goal, to answer with
speed any question that may arise on celestial objects.  For example,
suppose you have an urge to observe Jupiter tonight from your window; You
may consult rise/set times of Jupiter, ask when it crosses south-west
(supposing your window faces south-west), and with just a mouse click have
a glance at the simulated sky at this time.  You may even animate Jupiter's
path across the sky with a time-step animation.  Of course, if you're a
real star gazer, don't forget your binoculars or telescope for the real
thing!
