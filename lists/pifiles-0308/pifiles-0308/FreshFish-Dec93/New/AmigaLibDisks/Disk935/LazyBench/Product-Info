.description
A little utility for lazy people with a hard disk crammed full of goodies
which are too difficult to reach because they are buried away in drawers
inside drawers inside drawers inside drawers...  LazyBench installs itself
as a commodity, adds an item under the Workbench "Tools" menu and waits in
the background.  Use its hot key combination to pop up its window and then
select an item.  Now OS 2.xx only and fully "User Interface Style Guide"
compliant.  Font sensitive (uses the Default Screen Font) and each gadget
has a single key equivalent.
