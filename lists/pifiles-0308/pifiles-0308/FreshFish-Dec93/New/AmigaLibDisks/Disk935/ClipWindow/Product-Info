.description
A program that makes it easy to put frequently used text on the clipboard.
It opens an AppWindow on the Workbench which accepts Project icons and
associated text files.  The text is copied to the clipboard ready for
pasting.  Text may be in a separate disk file or directly entered as Tool
Types in the Project icon.  Also included is ConPaste, a Commodity by
Carolyn Scheppner which allows pasting clipboarded text almost anywhere.
AmigaDOS 2.0 or higher required.
