A graphical user interface for cli-based archivers like lha, arc, ape, zoo,
etc.  It has the 'look & feel' of a directory tool and can perform all
basic actions on archives, such as Add, Extract, List, Test, Delete, etc.
You can enter archives as if they were directories.  You don't have to know
anything about archivers.  Fully configurable.  Archivers not included,
requires AmigaDOS 2.0+.  An update to v1.10 on disk number 863.
