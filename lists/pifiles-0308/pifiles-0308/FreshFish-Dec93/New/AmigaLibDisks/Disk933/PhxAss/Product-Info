.description
PhxAss is a complete macro assembler, which supports the instruction-set
and addressing modes of all important Motorola processors
(MC68000,68010,68020,68030,68040,6888x and 68851).  It understands all
common assembler-directives (Seka, Devpac, Metacomco, etc.) and can
generate linkable Amiga-DOS object files or absolute code.  In both cases
the user has the opportunity to choose between the large and small
code/datamodel.  PhxAss is written entirely in assembly language and works
with Kickstart 1.2/1.3, OS2.x and OS3.x.  With documentation in English.
