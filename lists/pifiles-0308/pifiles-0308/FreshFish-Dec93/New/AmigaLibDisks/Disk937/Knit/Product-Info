Converts an IFF picture (8-colors or less) into a knitting pattern.  For a
specified stitch size, Knit will tell you how many stitches per row are
needed and how many rows are used.  Knit bases all of its calculations on
the size of a standard monitor screen which means that your finished
knitting should be about the size of your screen.  (Thus, if you have a
extra large or small monitor, you may need to make adjustments.)
