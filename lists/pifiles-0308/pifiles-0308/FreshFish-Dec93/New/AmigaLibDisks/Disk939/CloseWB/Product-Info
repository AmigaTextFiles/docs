This program attempts to close the WorkBench screen after "n" seconds.  It
is useful to put into startup-sequences that start an application and no
longer need the WorkBench screen (such as Imagine).  The closing of the
WorkBench screen will save some chip RAM.  Will work with any Amiga running
KickStart 2.0 or higher.  Binary and source included.
