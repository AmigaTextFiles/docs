.description
A tiny game for 2-5 players who fight against each other.  It is similar to
the commercial Dynablaster or Bomberman, except a 1-player mode is not
available.  On the other hand, there are a great number of extras.  To win
the game, one player has to disintegrate all other players by exploding
bombs.
