DMon is a multi-purpouse utility written for the author's personal use
during program development.  It is a Monitor, Dissassembler, Debugger and
development system.  You may find similarities to Amiga Monitor by Timo
Rossi, but DMon is different, it can dissassemble and debug 68xxx software
in User and Supervisor Mode.  If you do not know what that means, then do
not use DMon!
