An aid for graphics programmers.  PicCon will use the datatypes library to
load any picture format you've got support for, and you will then be able
to extract any part of the picture and save it in your desired format.
Ordinary bitplanes, "blitterlines", chunky pixels and various sprite
formats are supported.  The raw data can be saved as binary, assembly or C
source.  Saving of the palette entries in a variety of formats is also
supported.  Requires OS3.0.
