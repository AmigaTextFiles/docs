With the help of "Turbo-Leuschner" you are able to create your own menus
for Workbench-based windows or expand already existing menus.
Turbo-Leuschner supplies ALL functions of the Workbench-Menu-System.  With
Turbo-Leuschner, you supply the name of the window and the menu file to
attach to it, thus you can attach menus to the "AmigaShell" window, your
favorite GUI-based utility, or simply the WorkBench Window itself.
