An improved version of PD "Snake" game on disk number 810 by Michael
Warner.  You control an "orm" (Danish for worm or snake), living in a small
window on the default public screen, which grows by eating "frogs" and
avoiding obstacles.  This version tries to be smart about its window
borders and the screen mode (Interlace, Superhires, etc.).  Supports locale
library if present.  English, German, Italian, and Swedish catalogs are
supplied.  Default language is Danish.  Includes the catalog description
file and full DICE and SAS/C (Lattice) compatible source.  Public Domain.
Requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.
