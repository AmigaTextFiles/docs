.description
A utility to remind you about events.  It consists of an event editor and a
small program that is put in your WBStartup (or run from S:user-startup).
Every time you boot your machine, this program checks the event database
and puts up a requester (and optionally calls an ARexx script) if there are
events that you need to be reminded about.  C source included for DICE and
SAS6.x.
