Personal Phonedirectory (PPD) was designed to remember addresses and phone
numbers for you, and also dial the numbers automaticly.  PPD was designed
especially with multitasking in mind. When you are doing something else,
its window can be minimized, and when you need to, you can call someone
just by a click on the mouse. PPD uses almost no system power when not
used.
