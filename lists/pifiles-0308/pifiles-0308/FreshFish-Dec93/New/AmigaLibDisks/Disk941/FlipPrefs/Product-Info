.description
With this program, you can create several preferences files, (The
"DEVS:system-configuration" type) of different names and switch between
them on command.  A sample usage would be to customize the startup script
to set different preferences depending on the operating system booted into.
Could also be useful in different development environments or for machines
with multiple users.
