.description
A simple Clock program but with the handy feature that you can "snapshot"
the clock to stay with any screen or it can be free to pop to the frontmost
screen automatically.  Up to 4 alarm times can be set, which can simply put
up a requester or cause some program to run in background.  Hourly chimes
can also be made to run a program (I.E. a sound sample player).  Uses
locale.library with OS2.1+.
