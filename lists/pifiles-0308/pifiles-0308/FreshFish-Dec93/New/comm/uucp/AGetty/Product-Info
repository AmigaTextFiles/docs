AGetty is similar to the well-known Getty included in Matt Dillon's
AmigaUUCP package.  It hangs on the specified serial port waiting for
connections via the connected modem.  Once a connection is detected, AGetty
provides a Login: request to the caller.  Getty disconnects any caller who
cannot provide a legal login and Password within 60 seconds.  It also
allows only 3 login attempts before disconnecting.  Any attempt to login
with an illegal password will be written to the logfile.  Upon receiving a
legal Login and Password, verified via the passw-file, AGetty will execute
a specified program, usually UUCICO or PMail, and stay off the line until
the program returns.  Then, AGetty will disconnect the caller and reset the
modem, returning to its original state.
