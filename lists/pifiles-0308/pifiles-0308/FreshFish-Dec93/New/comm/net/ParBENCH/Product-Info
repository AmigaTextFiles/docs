A ParNET installation kit put together by Vernon Graner of Commodore
Business Machines.  It uses the CBM Installer and is fully documented.
ParNET itself is copyrighted by The Software Distillary and Doug Walker,
John Toebes, and Matt Dillon.  The main improvements between this ParBENCH
and the standard ParNET is the ease of installation and routine startup of
the NET: device.  This package contains a set of WorkBench tools to boot
the network and fix up and display remote node icons, etc.
