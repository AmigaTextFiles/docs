Multi-Application Graphic Image Communications.  A system of sharing 24-bit
image data between MAGIC-aware applications.  For example, you have loaded
an image into Application A for editing.  You decide you need to do a
special glitzy effect on the image, a task at which Application B excels.
Rather than saving the image to disk and then loading it into Application
B, you simply run Application B, select it's "Open MAGIC" menu option,
choose your image by name, and the image appears in Application B ready for
your effect.  When you're done, you simply quit Application B and you may
return to Application A where the image sits, glitzed and effected.
