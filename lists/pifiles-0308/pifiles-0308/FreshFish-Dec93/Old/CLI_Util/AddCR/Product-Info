Yet another Amiga/IBM text file converter, which (surprise, surprise)
converts Amiga style end-of-lines characters ($0a) to IBM format ($0d,$0a)
or vice versa.  Features: Should work on all amigas (or at least > wb1.2);
Relatively small (11k); Extremely fast (main loop is written in optimized
assembly); Works in low memory situations (min. memory requirement = 12288
bytes); Progress indicator; When converting to Amiga format, only ($0d,$0a)
characters are converted to $0a (all $xx,$0a are left alone where $xx <>
$0d); When converting to IBM format, ($0d,0a) pairs are left alone.
