.description
Moves files from here to there.  You may issue as many source files as will
fit on one command line, even including patterns.  Issuing directory names
will cause Move to create a directory of the same name within the
destination directory (if not already present) and move all the files from
the source directory to the destination, with all subdirectories.  Several
command line options for specifying cloning, verbosity, replace existing,
etc.  Requires OS2.x, includes SAS 6.3 C-source.
