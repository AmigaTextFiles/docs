A simple MAN command, known from UNIX systems.  The advantage is that it
recognizes .guide files to be AmigaGuide documents.  MAN then uses a
different viewer in order to display the AmigaGuide document.  You may
configure MAN using environment variables.  Configuration can be done for:
Directories, where to look for man pages (.doc|.man|.guide), ASCII
Textviewer, AmigaGuide Textviewer.
