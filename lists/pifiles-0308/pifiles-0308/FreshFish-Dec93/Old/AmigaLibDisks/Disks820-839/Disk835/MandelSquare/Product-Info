.description
Yet another program to generate images from the Mandelbrot set, different
from most implementations in that it runs only under AmigaOS 2.x, requires
an '020/'030/'040 CPU and a numerical coprocessor. The calculation routines
were written in '881 assembly language for maximum speed and precision.
Also included is a `movie mode' which allows generation of long camera
zooms to spots in the Mandelbrot set.  The resulting animations can be
saved in ANIM-opt-5 format, allowing to replay them using `MandelSquare' or
standard animation software.  Enhancements include support for the AGA
chipset (now you can finally create images in 256 colours!) and several bug
fixes and improvements in the image and animation creation code.
