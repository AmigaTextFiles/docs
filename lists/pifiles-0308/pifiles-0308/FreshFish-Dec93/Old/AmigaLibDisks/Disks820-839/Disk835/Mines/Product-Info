.description
A game in which you have to logically find out which parts of the
mine-field are not mined.  There are many kinds of minefields and you have
to be very careful to be able to solve the most difficult levels.  Mines
opens its own window on a Workbench screen and it's multitasking friendly.
This game was made and tested under Workbench 2.0, so the colors may look a
bit strange under WB1.3.
