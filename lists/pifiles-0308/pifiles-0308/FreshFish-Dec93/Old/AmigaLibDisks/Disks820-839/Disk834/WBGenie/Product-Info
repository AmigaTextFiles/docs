WBGenie is a WB-program launcher with a difference.  It is intended to be a
WB interface to a set of WB programs (which the author is in the process of
writing) to make performing housekeeping chores on the Amiga simple.
WBGenie is a WB2.x only program and is a commodity.  It makes use of
appicons and appwindows.  Includes some sample code to demonstrate how to
write a tool type array without affecting existing tool types.
