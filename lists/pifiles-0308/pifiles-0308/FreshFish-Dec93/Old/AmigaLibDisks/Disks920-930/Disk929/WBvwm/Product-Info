With Workbench 2.04 we got the ability to use a bigger Workbench screen
than fits on the display (virtual Workbench screen).  Biggest problem is
that scrolling around with the mouse is too slow, so the author decided to
make a program like X-window's olvwm, which also has virtual screens and
windows.  WBvwm opens up a small window representing the entire Workbench
area.  Within the window, "objects" represent all open windows.  By moving
an object, the corresponding window can be placed anywhere within the
Workbench area.  You may also instantly move to any part of the Workbench
area by double-clicking in the corresponding area of the WBvwm window.
Requires OS 2.04 or higher.
