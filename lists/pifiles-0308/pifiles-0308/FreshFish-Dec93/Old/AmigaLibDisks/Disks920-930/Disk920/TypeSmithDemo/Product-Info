A sneak peek at Soft-Logik's new font editor.  All features are enabled
except Save, Save As and Export.  TypeSmith can create and edit PostScript,
Compugraphic and Soft-Logik outline fonts (the three primary font systems
used on the Amiga).  TypeSmith has powerful drawing tools to allow you to
create new fonts.  You can also import characters and symbols from
structured drawing programs such as Art Expression.  With these powerful
features, you can create custom fonts and include your logo in your
favorite fonts.
