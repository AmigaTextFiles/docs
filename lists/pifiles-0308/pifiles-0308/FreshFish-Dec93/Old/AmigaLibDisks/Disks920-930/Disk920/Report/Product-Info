The Amiga "Report" program is to be used for generating all Amiga bug
reports and enhancement requests.  V40.1 adds subsystem changes (to match
our current database) and also some automatic detection of debugging tools
running on your system for insertion into bug reports (you may change this
list to match the tools you were running at the time the bug happened).
