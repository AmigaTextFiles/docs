pager central and uploading messages.  Features include: Alias files for
commonly paged people to be referred to by name rather than cryptic PIN
numbers; "Groups" file allowing messages to be easily sent to many people
working on the same project, same department, etc; Supports multiple pager
centrals through a Services configuration file; Full logging of messages
spooled, dialout attempts, etc. and much more.  Requires AmigaDOS 2.0+.
