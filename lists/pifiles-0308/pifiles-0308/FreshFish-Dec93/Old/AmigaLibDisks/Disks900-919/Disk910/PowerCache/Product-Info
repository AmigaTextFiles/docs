.description
A new, user friendly, completely configurable disk caching system.  Has
tons of features, including a font sensitive GUI, multiple unit caching,
selectable read-only or read/write cache mode, cache-in-a-file option,
statistics graphs, a low memory handler, a full ARexx interface and more
than 100k of AmigaGuide documentation, to mention a few.  Online help is
(optionally) available everywhere using AmigaGuide.  Installs as a simple
commodity and is of course hotkey controllable.  Requires at least
Kickstart 2.04.  Certain bonus features require 3.0 or later.  Localized,
CatComp source included.
