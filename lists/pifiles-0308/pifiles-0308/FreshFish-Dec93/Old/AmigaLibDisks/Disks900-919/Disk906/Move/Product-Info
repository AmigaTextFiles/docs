A compact, fast CLI move command that allows the moving of files over
multiple devices.  It will perform a "true" move (a la rename) when files
are being moved around on the same device, making it very fast, while still
being able to perform moves over multiple devices.  Move will also allow
you to move file links, and supports all standard 2.x wildcards.  Requires
kickstart 2.04 or higher.
