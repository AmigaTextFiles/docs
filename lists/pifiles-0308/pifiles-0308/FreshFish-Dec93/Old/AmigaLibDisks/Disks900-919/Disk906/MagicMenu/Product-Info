Replaces all Intuition menus, supporting both "pull-down" and "pop-up"
menus.  Menus can be displayed in either the Standard look, or the modern
AmigaOS 2.0 style 3D-Look, and controlled exclusively using the keyboard,
(no need to grab the mouse anymore!) Configurable handling and appearance.
Remembers every menu's last selected item, displaying Pop-Up menus the next
time at a position allowing quick selection of the same or neighboring
items.  Automatically brings the currently active screen (if not visible)
to the front for menu selection then returns it to the back after a
selection is made.  Input timeouts, plus much more!
