.description
Patches AmigaDOS, enabling all programs to read and write files packed with
PowerPacker in way that is completely transparent to themselves and the
system.  Programs will read powerpacked datafiles directly, and will also
magically start compressing their own datafiles, as they create or update
them.  An update to the version 38.115 on disk number 841.  Partially
localized for use with Workbench 2.1.  Requires Workbench 2.04+.
