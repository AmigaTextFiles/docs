.description
Allows users of ASDG's CygnusEd Professional to select a character via
point-n-click rather than having to remember (or lookup) the ascii keycode
for it.  Useful for entering international, special, or infrequently used
characters.  Fixes a bug present in version 1.0 on disk number 890.
Requires AmigaDos 2.0.
