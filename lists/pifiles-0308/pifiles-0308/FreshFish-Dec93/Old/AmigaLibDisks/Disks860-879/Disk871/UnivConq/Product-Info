A strategy game where two human players battle for control of the universe.

of planets, the initial number of ships, and the length of play.  Status
information is continually updated to allow the player to concentrate on
strategy, not statistics.  Includes digitized pictures and sound.
Compatible with WB 1.3 & 2.x.
