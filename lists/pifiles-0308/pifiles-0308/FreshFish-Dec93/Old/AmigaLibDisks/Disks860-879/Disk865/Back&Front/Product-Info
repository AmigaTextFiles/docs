Sends a window to the back or bring it to the front with defined actions.
For example, bring a window in front by double-clicking in it and send it
back with the middle mouse button.  Any keyboard or mouse event can be
trapped.  Number of required actions can be changed (double-click vs
tripleclick).  Implemented as a commodity.  Requires at least AmigaOS 2.04.
Includes german version and source in C.
