.description
An easy to use, versatile, yet full featured database program that will run
on any Amiga.  Search or sort on any field, print mailing labels,
(un)delete records, mail merge, get reports in many formats, scramble
files, flag records, and more.  Fields are user-configurable, so bBase can
be used to keep track of addresses, tape or video collections, recipe
files, or anything else you can think of one program does it all! bBaseIII
is a greatly enhanced successor to bBaseII.
