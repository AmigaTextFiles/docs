multitasking on workbench.  It's an emulation of CDTV's remote control, but
is a little more sophisticated.  Access to the archive even without a
CD-ROM-Drive (i.e. AMIGA 5004000), although you can't play a CD.  PROGRAM &
KARAOKE (live on-screen) included.  Recognizes CDs automatically.
AREXX-Port for usage in other programs.  FISH-WARE.
