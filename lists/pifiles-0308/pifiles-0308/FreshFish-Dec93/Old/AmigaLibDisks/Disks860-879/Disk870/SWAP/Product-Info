.description
Memory management may be considered as one of the weak points of Amiga OS.
SWAP was written as a trial to provide swapping for Amigas without any
special hardware.  The main intention is to let the user choose a task,
swap it to disk so that its occupied memory is released, and do other
things.  Later on, he could swap the program back to main memory and let it
continue from the point it was interrupted.
