.description
An emulation of an oscillograph, with five internal signal generators.  The
internal signals can be freely edited, even mathematical functions can be
used.  External signals can be used when a digitizer is connected to the
Amiga.  This program can be used for learning, demonstration, and even
simple technical applications.  The german original and the english
translation are included, as well as a set of oscillations.
