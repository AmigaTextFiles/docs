The BootBlock Utility.  Includes functions to store, install, view, or
execute any disk bootblock.  Also self-made bootblocks can be installed to
disk.  The most powerful function is to save any bootblock as an executable
CLI-File.  Now you can start every boot-util, viruschecker, game, or loader
from the CLI.  Also included is a drawer with 46 different bootblocks.
BootJob requires Amiga OS2.x.
