Demo version of a new, easy to use, AmigaDOS 2.0 text editor.  The demo is
the same as the registered version, except that save and print are disabled
in the demo.  Inspire uses the new features of AmigaDOS 2.0 extensively,
including using the ASL requester for font and file selection, and the
gadtools library for standardized gadgets.  The display database is used so
you may open any type of screen that your computer is capable of.  Features
include an ARexx port, undo, find and replace, bookmarks, text centering,
word wrap, case conversions, clipboard support, auto indenting, and more.
