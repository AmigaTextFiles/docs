.description
A program to render a space filling representation of atoms in molecules.
This is the type of representation one would find in the plastic 'CPK'
(Corey, Pauling, Kendrew) models often used in organic chemistry.  There
are no hard coded constraints on the number of atoms it can process, it
correctly handles intersecting 3-dimensional spheres by using the Bresenham
circle algorithm in 3D, and computes using the the current display screen
resolution for simplicity and speed.
