A "pop-up-anywhere" (almost!) color palette commodity with several features
I could not find in other palette tools.  Features include: Load/Save color

Complement selected color; Left/right shifting of the entire palette;
Ability to permanently alter (patch) the color tables of executables with a
statically allocated color table.  Requires OS2.04 or greater.  Version
0.84 (alpha release).
