.description
A hierachical, programmable, in-core database that runs under OS 1.3 and OS
2.0.  Has a full intuition interface.  Features include two display
methods, filter datasets, search datasets, print datasets, and much more.
Nearly everything can be realized by programming AmigaBase. Datatypes can
be Integer, Real, Boolean, String, Memo (Text), Date and Time.  Number of
datasets is only limited by available memory.  Also included in the package
are some example projects.
