.description
The language FALSE and it's compiler were designed for only two reasons:
building a working compiler in just 1k (!) and designing a language that
looks cryptic and fuzzy (in the APL tradition).  The result is a language
that is quite powerful (for it's size).  It's a Forth type language with
lambda abstraction and lots of other goodies.
