.description
When working in the Shell, allows you to complete filenames by just hitting
the <TAB> key in a manner similar to that commonly found on UNIX systems.
When similar filenames exist, CFN will complete the file name up to the
point they differ, then wait for you to add more characters, after which
you can simply press the <TAB> key again to complete a unique file name.
