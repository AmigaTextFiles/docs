.description
An automated DMake file generator.  You give it the names of all the
C-files used to produce your executable (except #include'd .c or .h files),
and it will automatically scan them to find all dependencies, and produce a
ready to use (in many cases) DMakeFile calling DCC with options you will
need for normal compilation and linking.
