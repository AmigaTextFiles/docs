.description
This is a freely distributable demo version of a powerful compiler for
Oberon-2.  Oberon-2 is one of the most modern object-oriented languages.
This language was designed with the aim to increase the power of Modula-II
and to extend it with object-oriented facilities while reducing its
complexity.  This implementation features a parallel incremental
garbagecollector, a runtime source-level debugger, fast compilation,
optimized code, language extensions to access AmigaOS, etc.
