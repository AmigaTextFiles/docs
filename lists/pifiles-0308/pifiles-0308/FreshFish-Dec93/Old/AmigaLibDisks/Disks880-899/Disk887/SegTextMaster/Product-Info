A little tool for programmers who need to use large amounts of text in
their programs (I.E. adventure games).  It creates an array of characters
with a header.  Makes compiling/assembly time very quick and reduces space
requirements.  Requires AmigaDOS 1.2 or higher.  Sample source for
application included.
