This is the initial release of the patch.library programmer's pack.  It
provides easy-to-use functions to safely install custom code for library
functions.  Two example programs ShowNeededFiles and CPUClear demonstrate
how the library works.  ShowNeededFiles patches dos.library to print
messages whenever Open(), LoadSeg() or Lock() is called.  CPUClear patches
graphics.library/BltClear() to use the CPU instead of the Blitter.
Assembly source is included for the example programs.
