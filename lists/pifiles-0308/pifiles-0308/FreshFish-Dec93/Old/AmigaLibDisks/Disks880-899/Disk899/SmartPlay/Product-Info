A quite small, and really fast multiformat moduleplayer for OS2.0+.
Supports most moduleformats around, and will play all modules with the
_right_ replayroutines.  The CPU usage of this player is also really low,
so it will run fine even on a 7MHz Amiga, while doing some highspeed serial
transfers.  100% coded in assembler.
