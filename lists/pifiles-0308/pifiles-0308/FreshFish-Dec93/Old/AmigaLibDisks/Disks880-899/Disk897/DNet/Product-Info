.description
A link protocol that provides essentially an unlimited number of reliable
connections between processes on two machines, where each end of the link
can be either an Amiga or a Unix (BSD4.3) machine.  Works on the Amiga with
any EXEC device that looks like the serial.device.  Works on UNIX with tty
and socket devices.  Achieves better than 95% average throughput on file
transfers.
