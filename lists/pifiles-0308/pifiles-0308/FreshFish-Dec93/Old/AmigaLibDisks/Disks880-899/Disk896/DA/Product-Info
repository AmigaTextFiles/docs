"Digital Aesthetics".  A program that provides you with a soothing audio
environment in which to work, similar to the cd's/tapes available of
rainstorms, ocean surfs, rivers, etc.  The sounds are contained in modules
called "EMods", short for Environment MODules.  With DA, you can control
various aspects of these EMods, and link EMods together in a list to be
played in sequence.  Two short EMods are provided, with more available when
you purchase the registered version.  OS2.x required.
