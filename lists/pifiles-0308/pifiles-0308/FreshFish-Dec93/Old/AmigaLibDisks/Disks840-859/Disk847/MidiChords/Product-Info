A program which replaces and extends the chord-key-playfunction, as may be
found on several low priced keyboards.  To make full use of this code a
MIDI interface and a keyboard capable of MIDI reception is required,
however, a limited audio output is available too.  Some special harmonic
routines are: Chord Finding, Sequencing and Random Play.  Chords and
sequences are played by simple mouse clicks and recorded Seqfiles can be
saved (and loaded).  On-line information may be switched on/off.
