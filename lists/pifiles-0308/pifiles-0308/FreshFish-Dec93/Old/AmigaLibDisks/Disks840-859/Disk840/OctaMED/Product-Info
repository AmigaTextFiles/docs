.description
A music editor which was originally designed for making music for programs
(demos, games, etc), but works well as a standalone music program as well.
OctaMED is the 8-channel version of MED.  This is a freely distributable
release of the fully functional commercial version 2.0.  Versions later
than 2.0 remain commercial and are *not* freely redistributable at this
time.  Previous releases were version 1.00b on disk 579 and a demo of
version 4.0 on disk 755.
