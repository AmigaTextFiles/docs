.description
Patches AmigaDOS, enabling all programs to read and write files packed with
PowerPacker in way that is completely transparent to themselves and the
system.  Programs will read powerpacked datafiles directly, and will also
magically start compressing their own datafiles, as they create or update
them.  Partially localized for use with Workbench 2.1.  Workbench 2.04+
only.
