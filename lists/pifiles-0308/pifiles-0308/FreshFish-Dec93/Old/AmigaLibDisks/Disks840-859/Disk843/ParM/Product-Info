Parametrable Menu.  ParM allows you to build menus to run any program in
either in WorkBench or CLI mode.  This is an alternative to MyMenu which
can run only when WorkBench is loaded.  ParM can have it's own little
window, can attach menus to the CLI window you are running it from, or to
the WB menus, just like MyMenu.  Versions 3.6 & 4.3.
