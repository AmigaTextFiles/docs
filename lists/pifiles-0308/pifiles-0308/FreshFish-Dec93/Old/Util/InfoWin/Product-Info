A simple little program written to use MUI.  MUI stands for 'Magical User
Interface', an awesome package by Stefan Stuntz.  InfoWin keeps track of
messages sent to it via its ARexx port.  I wrote it to track messages from
my Caller ID ARexx script so that I would have an easy way of seeing my new
calls.  It's not complete yet (ie. it's not as fully featured as I hope to
make it eventually) but it is already in use on my system.
