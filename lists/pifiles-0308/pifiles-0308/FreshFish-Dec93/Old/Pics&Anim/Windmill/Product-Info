This is a 100 frame test animation I did as a proof of a concept for a
technique I developed to simulate tall grass blowing in the wind.  The
method used to create it is described in articles I wrote for Amiga
Video/Graphics and a new publication, LightWave Pro (put out by the VTU
people).  It was done with LightWave 3.0 and took about 10mins per frame
with antialiasing at 752x480 resolution on a 33MHz Zeus equipped 2000.
