A small preview of the Barfly Assembler/Debugger enviroment.  The picture
of bdebug shows 2 debug sessions on an A2024 and the guide file is an old
file I wrote for the devcon, so it doesn't represent the current state but
it's still quite accurate.  The only *major* thing missing in that guide is
that the debugger can also stop on enforcer hits.
