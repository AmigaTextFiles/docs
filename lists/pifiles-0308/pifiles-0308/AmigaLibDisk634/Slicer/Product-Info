.description
A program for creating abstract art based on mathematical functions, such
as the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and related abstractions (chaotic
dynamical systems).  Features include fast fixed or floating point
arithmetic, many different functions, many computation options, many
coloring and rendering options, batch mode, focus, multi pass, zoom in,
zoom out, pan, and four dimensional navigation.  The produced pictures can
be thought of as cross sections or "slices" revealing the insides of solid
(if imaginary) objects.
