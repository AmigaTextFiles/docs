An extended version of the 0L-system (string rewriting) described in The
Science of Fractal Images (edited by Pietgen and Saupe).  The basic
algorithm has been expanded and modified extensively, and looping commands
similiar to those found in other Turtle graphics systems (Logo, etc) have
been added.  Support for three-dimensional drawing, with perspective, is
also included.
