A large ray-traced animation created with Turbo Silver SV, Deluxe Photolab,
Deluxe Paint III, and the Director.  It consists of approximately 60 to 70
frames of animation, rendered during a period of about three and a half
weeks.  This is Bradley Schenck's entry to the 1989 BADGE Killer Demo
contest, and won first place in the contest.  Because of its size, it has
been split across two disks.  The rest of the files are on disk 264.
