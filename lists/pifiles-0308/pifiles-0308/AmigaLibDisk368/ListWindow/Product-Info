.description
Gives simple initialization, handling, and freeing of Macintosh-like
"list-windows." These are user-sizeable windows with a scrollable list of
text strings, optionally sortable.  The list can be scrolled with a
scroll-bar, up and down arrows, arrow keys, or a SHIFT+key combination
which searches for the first occurance of the specified key.  Source and a
sample program included.
