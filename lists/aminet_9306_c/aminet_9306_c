ab20/aplictns/abstract.:

Complete application programs (differs from utilities in that these are
polished final products, not tools to make such products). This directory
contains complete applications.  Demos (or crippleware) of products are found
in /ab20/demos/commercial, instead of here, no matter how functional the demo
is.  These differ from utilities in a subtle way -- utilities are what one uses
to build applications.  


gnuemacs-1.10 (directory)
    This is the Amiga GNU Emacs version 1.10, ported by Mark Henning.  Because
    of its size and complexity, the distribution is divided into lharc'd files.

    An expression calculator with many powerful features, including
    user-defined functions and variables, many built-in functions, script
    files, and special looping constructs.  Handles expressions involving both
    real AND complex numbers.  This is version 1.1a, with a major bug-fix and
    some small enhancements.  Source (in C and Yacc) is included.  Should work
    on all Amigas.  - Martin Scott (email:  mws@castle.ed.ac.uk)

    This is a program for checking "dms" files on unix systems.  


imploder-4.0.lzh (141145 bytes)
    This archive contains the Imploder 4.0 distribution.  The Imploder allows
    you to reduce the size of executable files while having them retain their
    full functionality.  There are other "crunchers" or "packers" available for
    the Amiga, but none are as mindful of the complexities of your Amiga system
    as the Imploder (IMHO). In addition to this, its algorithms are more
    efficient, both in terms of speed, and size reduction.  


lha-0.99c.lzh (44521 bytes)
    A high performance Data compression utility for the Commodore Amiga.  Amiga

    file attribute flags.  


lhunarc-0.96.lzh (15964 bytes)
    Fast .LZH extractor for the Amiga.  Lhunarc is a lightning fast file
    extractor for LHARC archives (files with an extension of .LZH). It is
    compatible with MS-DOS version 1.13c, and is two and a half times as fast
    as Amiga Lharc 1.1, as you will soon discover.  


lhwarp-1.40.lzh (33052 bytes)
    Lhwarp is a program which will read tracks directly from your floppy disk,
    (or any other device), compress them, and output them to a file.  Lhwarp
    will produce files which are much smaller than those produced by Warp,
    since Lhwarp uses a much more efficient compression algorithm (Adaptive
    Huffman Encoding); the same algorithm used in LHARC.  Typically, an Lhwarp
    file will be 80% of the size of an equivalent Warp file, resulting in quite
    reasonable hard drive space savings.

    (manual page). -- sie@fulcrum.bt.co.uk (Simon Raybould) 


uujoin-1.01.lzh (33664 bytes)
    Version 1.01:  Joins and decodes USENET binary files.  I found myself
    spending too much time editing, merging and decoding uuencoded binaries
    downloaded from the net, so I whipped up this crude little filter/decoder. 
    It's quite simple and probably could have been done with awk, but I chose
    to do it in C.  The program, in its current state, is hardwired for various
    machine types but is easily altered.  See the source for documentation.

FISHCON

The FishCon files are a series of content files from the Fred Fish
collection.  

Each Fishcon file is a collection of the content files from 50 
contiguous Fish disks.  FishCon-001 is a notable exception in that
it only contains the first 49 files (001-049).  Each collection
begins with the FishCon extension number. (e.g. FishCon-250 would
have content files 250 - 299)

The highest numbered FishCon file (currently FishCon-300) will contain
files up to the most current release of Fred Fish disks.

Each FishCon file is paginated into 60 line pages with no form feed
between pages to accomodate the requirements of our local printers.  

The entire series is page-numbered consecutively and contiguously.  
This allows for direct page indexing which has now been added to the 
FishXref for those who wish to use  hardcopy form of the FishCon 
collection and the FishXref.

These changes have been made to reflect currently expressed needs 
of the users of the FishXref.  I hope they prove satisfactory to
the user group at large.

Puggles.dms (369398 bytes)
    PUGGLES is a wonderful version of a truly ancient game called Q-BERT.  It
    comes from the January issue of AMIGA POWER, and it was written by a new

    do, but if you've never played Q-BERT, basically you have to hop across

hextris-1.0.lzh (26880 bytes)
    This is Amiga hextris, a unique version of "Tetris" based on hexoganal
    pieces.  Hextris is a variation on the 'Tetris' theme.  As you all know
    Tetris is a game where geometric shapes drop into a well.  The pieces stack
    up until the well is full.  The stack can be shortened if a horizontal line
    is completed.  The game pieces are based on rectangles and each piece has
    four rotations.  What's the twist, you ask? Hextris has the same gameplay
    as tetris, but the game pieces are based on hexagons.  Therefore each piece
    has six rotations instead of four.  Which makes for a unique challenge
    (hey, I enjoyed it). See the readme in the archive for more details.

ringwar.lzh (46647 bytes)
    RingWar is a shoot-em-up game based on the vector graphics of old arcade
    games.  More specifically, it is a pretty blatant ripoff of the old arcade
    game StarCastle, with some added embellishments.  The game should work on
    all Amigas, including Amiga 3000's.  It works under WB 2.0.  The game
    requires ~220K of chip ram, plus about another ~100K for the executable. 
    The game will work on a stock (512K) Amiga 500.  RingWar disables
    multitasking while running.  However, it asks for resources in a system
    friendly way.  For instance, if it can't get the RAM it needs, the game
    will not run.  Too, when exiting, the program returns the resources it
    took, returning to DOS gracefully.  See the ReadME file in the archive! The
    game has no copy protection of any sort.  It can be played/copied to
    HardDrives or RAMDrives.  I (Eric Bazan) wrote the game, and am releasing
    it under the ASDG name as CharityWare.  That is, if you like it, send money
    to one of the three organizations listed in the introduction text.  Again,
    hope you enjoy the game! Send comments/suggestions/bugs to:

adaed-1.0.11a.lzh (809397 bytes)
    This is AdaEd version 1.0.11a,the first release of an Ada
    compiler/interpreter for Amiga DOS 1.3 (and presumably higher). The
    "executable" is run by an interpreter and is therefore quite slow.  It
    does, however, multi-task and was apparently validated under an older
    version (1.7) of the ACVC tests.  You need at least 1.5 Meg of RAM to run
    this and 2 Meg is recommended.  Executables and examples take up 2 Meg of
    disk space when unpacked.

    Osc is a real-time digital oscilloscope to be used with a mono 8-bit
    sampler connected to the parallel port.  Osc can be started from CLI or WB.
     No parameters.  It should work with A500/1000/2000/3000.  Preferably in
    PAL-mode since it needs 256 scanlines to display all 8 bits of a waveform. 
    Features include scanning, trigging, time-measuring and a signal generator.

    ShellTimer by John Lindwall.  ShellTimer is a multitasking-friendly
    shell-based stopwatch program.  It is useful when you need to measure the
    amount of time taken by an operation.  With this simple shell command you
    can start a timer and later stop it; the elapsed time will be displayed. 
    ShellTimer can be useful to time compile/link operations, renderings,
    program executions, script files, etc.  Since it is shell-based, the
    command can be invoked from AmigaDOS scripts, from Arexx macros, from
    makefiles, or interactively.  This program requires AmigaDOS 2.04.

Printer drivers and utilities that are very printer specific.  


EpsonQPlus-V5.lzh (17884 bytes)
    Printer driver for Epson compatible printers.  By Wolf Faust.  


HP_DeskJet500.lzh (7535 bytes)
    This is an Amiga Printer driver for the HP DeskJet 500 printer.  It will
    not work with either the original DeskJet or the DeskJet Plus, since it
    uses various escape sequences that were first introduced with the DeskJet
    500.  It may or may not work with HP LaserJet printers.  


PF_DeskJet.lzh (69064 bytes)
    The program PF (short for PRINTFILES) is an utility written to print text
    files on an Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 printer connected to the parallel
    port of an Amiga personal computer, selecting in the same time the font and
    the printing style between the internal options of this printer.  


PS_driver-0.9.lzh (6919 bytes)
    This is a POSTSCRIPT printer driver.  It is only version .9, but it seems
    to work pretty well.  It accepts graphics, as well as text output, and if
    you use it with the CMD command, you can have a postscript file output from
    any program which can print! Kinda nice! I found this little gem on
    hubcap.clemson.edu, but I thought I'd move it here so more people could get
    a look at it.  Scott Ellis CIVIR1070@ucsvax.sdsu.edu 


bookprint-3.16.lzh (18265 bytes)
    BookPrint is a printing utility which will print a file in two columns on
    the front and back page of your paper, thus saving about 75% of paper and
    making the file more easily to read (you can read it like a book then).
    Especially useful for printing large documentation of PD-programs.  A
    printer capable of printing in 20cpi mode is needed.  Version 3.16,
    ShareWare, binary only Author : Alexander Rawass 


docmaster-1.0.lzh (58172 bytes)
    This is a program to print out plain ASCII doc files in a nice, formatted
    way.  With this program it is possible to do things like multi-column
    output, or have very small printouts (eg I have got the Devpac2 README file
    on one sheet of A5 clipped into the manual...) There are these files in the
    archive:  s (dir) 160x90.PRT 37 \ Some demo datafiles for the program. 
    These 80x60NLQ.PRT 38 | will probably only work on an Epson 80x80NLQ.PRT 38
    / compatible printer DocMaster 80292 The wonderful program itself
    docmaster.doc 6885 The doc file that you will probably ignore
    DocMaster.DOC.info 2570 \ The icon files.  Feel free to redraw them. 
    DocMaster.info 1122 / Any problems, email LNJ1@uk.ac.york 


goodcolorjet.lzh (23552 bytes)
    Preliminary HP_500C driver (also support HP_Deskjet) This HP_500C driver is
    an preliminary version of an HP_Deskjet printer driver which supports the
    HP 500C printer.  This driver is suitable for the DeskJet, DeskJet Plus,
    DeskJet 500 and DeskJet 500C printers.  The driver has been tested with
    both the 500C and original DeskJet printer.  For the 500C both color and
    B&W graphics are supported.  For compatibility the maximum number of dots
    vertically is 3000 (at 300 DPI) when US Letter papersize is specified. 
    Select CUSTOM as papersize to get 3100 dots vertically.  For color
    graphics, 3065 dots (at 300 DPI) is used for both US Letter and CUSTOM
    printer preferences.  Other paper sizes are calculated as before.  Support
    for DINA4 and US Legal paper sizes tested and seems OK.  


post-1.6src.lzh (169984 bytes)
    Postscript interpreter - Post V1.6 This distribution was released as the
    archive files "post16b.lzh" (binaries) and "post16s.lzh" (sources),
    19-Apr-91 The binaries were uploaded to ab20 quite some time ago - the
    sources are in this archive.  


postdj.lzh (17471 bytes)
    The program calls the PostScript interpreter library to render a series of
    PostScript files to Deskjet printer connected to the parallel port.  It
    supports all the possible page sizes, i portrait or landscape orientation. 
    It has been tested on a Deskjet Plus.  It will likely work with the other
    current models in the Deskjet family or emulations thereof.

Replacement command line interfaces (CLIs). 


SKsh017.lzh (344350 bytes)
    SKsh is a "shell" (similar to, but much more powerful than the AmigaDos
    CLI) which provides similar functionality to the Unix "ksh". SKsh is
    copyrighted by freely distributable software, and it runs under AmigaDos
    1.3 or 2.0 on 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, or 3000 systems.  It requires a hard
    disk to be very useful.  SKsh provides many features that the AmigaDos CLI
    does not - for example, it was the first Amiga shell to provide file name
    completion, user definable keyboard editing, or shell functions.  


csh519.lha (182522 bytes)
    A replacement for the standard Amiga shell.  Quite similar to its UNIX
    equivalent, but not script compatible.  Has 100+ built in commands and 80+
    built in functions, file name completion, file type recognition and a very
    powerful scripting language.

pattern.lzh (72685 bytes)
    This is version 5.0 of a shared library, which is able to and pgrep match
    an AmigaDOS pattern with a string and to convert strings or characters into
    uppercase or lowercase, including umlauts.  The library works with
    Kickstart V1.2 and higher and the patternmatching routines are compatible
    with ARP and AmigaDOS 2.0 patternmatching.  An ARexx function library is
    available, too.  One of the external programs included in this package is
    "pgrep" version 0.4, a small grep command, that finds a string or an
    AmigaDOS pattern in one or several files or in stdin (default). Freeware,
    binary only.  Author:  Angela Schmidt

ab20/utilitys/virus/abstract.:

Virus detectors and eradication software.  


bigbrother-3.12.lzh (27143 bytes)
    BigBrother is a virus infection detection program with some optional
    utilities.  The check routine is running as a normal task with a priority
    of -1 checking the important memory locations in the Amiga.  Depending on
    the values and the their combinations, an expert system will accept it or
    warn you in case it thinks it is dangerous.  This means that no program can
    start a virus in memory without alerting BigBrother.  As a bonus,
    BigBrother is capable of starting a new shell, starting script files,
    viewing and installing bootblocks.  BigBrother uses direct Rom code (in a
    legal way) for performing the reads and writes to disk.  


bootx-3.80d.lzh (92349 bytes)
    BootX is a virus killer written by Peter Stuer.  This archive comes
    straight from Fish Disk 542.  BootX can check the bootblock of a disk,
    check memory for any resident viruses, and scan files for link viruses.  It
    can load a library of bootblocks for you to install on your disks as an
    alternative to the standard DOS bootblock.  It can load brainfiles so you
    can add any new bootblocks that BootX does not yet recognize.  BootX is
    written completely in assembly for maximum speed and minimum size.  It
    fully supports AmigaDOS/Workbench/Kickstart 2.0, but is also Kickstart 1.3
    compatible.  It recognizes 22 file/link viruses, 120 bootblock viruses, and
    67 other bootblocks.  It has a really nice user interface, making use of
    the Kickstart 2.0 routines or the ARP library under Kickstart 1.3. 
    Released August 10, 1991.  Highly recommended.  


virus_checker-6.01.lzh (43854 bytes)
    smart virus detector with arexx interface; runs under 1.3 or 2.0... by
    johnv@tower.actrix.gen.nz (John Veldthuis) 


virusx-4.0.lzh (64684 bytes)
    Since the VirusX 4.01 release is not a full release (it is missing the
    source and documentation files), I have uploaded the latest full release
    (4.0). This is an archive produced by taking the Zoo archive found on Fish
    Disk 287 and converting it to Lharc format.  howell@ares.tn.cornell.edu
    (Colin Howell) 


virusx-4.01.lzh (14007 bytes)
    VirusX 4.01 is a small update from VirusX 4.00 - I've made a lot of changes
    to the program, but there is only one visible change - and it's actually an
    invisible change.  See the `release.note' for details.  


vscan-5.12.lha (49565 bytes)
    VScan was made to easily check all files that I received from different
    sources for the TTV1 virus, since there was no killer available for this
    virus.  I also included the IRQ virus, even though I haven't seen this
    since the release of KickStart 1.3.  Then KV was released with VirusX 3.20,
    and nobody needed VScan anymore (sob). I figured out I had to offer
    something more, and started working on the Analyze routine to check for
    completely NEW viruses on files.  So VScan grew.  The current version will
    scan memory, files and bootblocks for viruses, and can keep a brain file
    which remembers the file sizes of all your precious programs, and more... 


zerovirus-2.0.lzh (79445 bytes)
    This program is a complete virus detection, removal, and protection system.
     Using ZeroVirus, you can check the bootblock of any disc.  You can install
    the disc (removing any virus that is present) with one of four different
    bootblocks, and backup the bootblocks of your commercial programs to ensure
    recovery from any viruses in the future.  You can also use ZeroVirus to
    check a directory or a whole disc for any known file (link) viruses.
