Information about NHS
=====================

NHS (NComm Host System) is a script program for use with NComm 1.9 (or
higher), running on the Commodore-Amiga.

NHS is a very simple yet flexible and customizable bulletin board
system.  It is well suited for small, private boards, which main purpose
is up- and downloading of files and perhaps a couple of messages.

Its main features are:

  * Three security levels: ordinary users, cosysops  and SYSOP.

  * All menus are on disk for easy customizing.

  * Any number of bulletins can be installed simply by creating
    files "bull1", "bull2", ... and editing the bulletin menu

  * Up- and downloads with user selectable protocol.  Uses the
    G&R protocol if G&R host mode is enabled.  Upload and
    Download directories can be configured.  If the upload and download
    directories refer to the same directory, uploaded files will
    immediately be available for public download.  Otherwise, the SYSOP
    will have to move uploaded files to the download directory.
    All of NComms protocols suported.

  * "List files" gives a list of all public files, along with file
    size, creation date, file description etc. 

  * Users may read & write public messages, and enter private messages
    to each other and the SYSOP.

  * Chat function.

  * User can view and extract archived files.  'Hold' directory.

  * All user operations are logged in a special logfile.

    password, and read his private messages.

  * Sleep disconnect after five minutes of user inactivity.

  * Detection of NO CARRIER.

  * All users have thier own password
