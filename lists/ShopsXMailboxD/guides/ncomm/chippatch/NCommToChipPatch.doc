BACKGROUND
~~~~~~~~~~
People have trouble using NComm after innstalling FAST 040 accelerators in
their A4000. NComm gets a hickup and the text are presented many times.
This makes it impossible to use NComm at all. After a suggestion for Jon
Anders (Aja) Haugum was NComm put in Chip memory using NoFastMem. This
solved the problem. So here is the patch for NComm which makes NComm to load
to Chip memory automatically. 


INSTALLATIN
~~~~~~~~~~~
o Unpack this achive.
o Open a shell windov.
o Change directory to the directory of the archive contents.
o Execute: Path "" add
o Change directory to the directory of your NComm executable.

o Execute: copy NComm.info ChipNComm.info

The patch is now installed. When you execute ChipNComm instead of NComm
will NComm be loaded to chip memory.
