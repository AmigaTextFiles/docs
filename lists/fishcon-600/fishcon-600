PP              Patches AmigaDOS and makes decrunching of powerpacked files
                completely transparent to any program attempting to read
                such files.  This means that any program may work directly 
                on powerpacked datafiles, without any need to decrunch these
                first with PowerPacker.  A must for Powerpacker fans.  
                Version 1.4, an update to version 1.3 on disk 542.  Full
                source is included.

JM              Job Manager is a utility which extends the AmigaDos multi-
                tasking environment by providing features such as: allocation of
                CPU cycles in any ratio to multiple CPU bound processes, default
                task priorities based on task name, task logging, system uptime 
                reports, task CPU use and CPU % reports, task invocation times,
                & more.  Has very little impact on the system itself.  Requires
                AmigaDOS 2.04 or later.  Includes 68000/20 & 68030/40 versions.

MathsAdv        A simple game where you, the young adventurer, must try to
                escape the king's Maths Adventure.  To do this you must pass
                through a series of rooms.  In each room you are given a
                math problem to solve, after which you can proceed to the
                next room if you answer correctly.  The problems become more
                involved and more difficult in each room.  Includes source.

                age.  This demo is fully functional except for disabled save
                and export functions.  DynaCADD requires at minimum an Amiga
                with 1Mb of RAM and a hard drive, or two floppy drives.  A de-
                interlacer of some kind is highly recommended.  This disk con-
                tains all the files necessary to recreate the DynaCADD demo
                disk number 1.  The files for demo disk number 2 can be found
                on library disk number 604 and the files for demo disks 3 and
                4 can be found on library disk number 605.  This is an update
                to version 1.84 on disks 434 and 435, and now includes both 
                68000 and 68020/030 versions.  
                Version 2.04.  Binary only.

ICONtrol        An easy to use CLI command that gives you control over Workbench
                icons.  It's main purpose is to update the look of your icons 
                for AmigaDOS 2.0, which can be done by swapping the colors in an
                icon or giving new images to them.  It can be used to clear an
                icon's absolute position in a drawer or on Workbench.  	So it is
                also a helpful tool if you are not yet using AmigaDOS 2.0.
                Version 1.0, binary only.

                times of day.  Facilities are provided for the adding, editing
                and deleting of messages, and for displaying the times and
                texts of pending messages.  A chime program is included to
                enable the time to be announced at regular intervals.

RingWar         A classic arcade game of reflexes.  The graphics are based on
                the vector style of the old arcade games such as Asteroids and
                Tempest.  The goal of the game is to penetrate through the three
                rotating rings and hit the five pointed star in the ringship at
                the center of the rings, while avoiding randomly appearing 
                mines, and the ringship firing back at you.  Binary only.

                disk numbers 3 & 4.  The files for demo disk number 1 can be
                found on library disk number 603 and the files for demo disk
                2 can be found on library disk number 604.  This is an update
                to version 1.84 on disks 434 and 435, and now includes both 
                68000 and 68020/030 versions.

TrackDOS        A program that allows easy transfer of data between DOS, memory
                and trackdisk.device.  DOS means the data contained within a
                file, memory means the data contained anywhere within the memory
                map and trackdisk.device means data stored on a disk not access-
                able with DOS (eg. bootblocks special loader disks etc.).  The 
                transfer of data between these three areas is not normally easy
                or convenient.  TrackDos was written to overcome this.  This is 
                an update to version 1.08 on disk 502.  
                Version 1.11.  Binary only.

Elvis           A UNIX vi/ex editor clone.  Supports nearly all the vi/ex

                sampled sound file formats available on different platforms to
                the Amiga's IFF 8SVX format or into RAW data.  It recognizes
                .VOC, .au (ulaw, 16, 24, or 32 bit samples), .WAV, and Macin-
                tosh headered samples, and converts them appropriately. It can
                also identify ulaw, signed, and unsigned RAW data, converting
                it properly.  It treats unidentifiable headered files as RAW,
                so they are treated properly also.  
                Version 2.3, includes source.

Dog             A puzzle where the object is to push boxes to designated
                locations.  Uses HAM mode and is written in JForth. Relative
                difficulty for this puzzle is easy,  but it will take over a
                half hour for most people to find the solution.  
                Version 1.0, binary only.

JM              Job Manager is a utility which extends the AmigaDos multi-
                tasking environment by providing features such as: allocation
                of CPU cycles in any ratio to multiple CPU bound processes,
                default task priorities based on task name, task logging,
                system uptime reports, task CPU use and CPU % reports, task
                invocation times, and more.  JM has very little impact on the
                system itself.  Requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or later.  Includes
                68000/20 and 68030/40 versions.  This is an update to version
                1.0 on disk 602.  New features include better task name 
                detection, an ARexx port, and a number of bug fixes.
