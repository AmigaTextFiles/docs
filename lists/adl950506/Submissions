What information we are looking for:

 o If you have an unusual Amiga set-up, we'd like to know how demos work
    on it.  This includes AGA machines (1200 & 4000) as well as ECS machines
    with 2 megs CHIP, 68030's, etc.

 o If you have or know of a demo that isn't in the list, please submit the
    information.  If the demo isn't available for FTP, please consider sending
    it to Aminet and/or Funet, or, if you don't have FTP access, mail me
    for information on sending me the demo so that I may send it.

 o If you have information regarding a demo party that isn't in the list
    (compo info, etc.) or additional info on listed parties please submit
    this.

 o If you belong to a group that is either not represented in the list or
    is not represented fully please mail me so that I may include all the
    correct information.

 o Any other information you think would be useful.


Please see "Comments/Suggestions/Ideas" in the ADL document for more
information on submitting information, including where I can be reached.
