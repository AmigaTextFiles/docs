&quot;I remember when Dunkie and Pete first thought of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, it was talked
about on Fluffynet some time ago.  To be honest I didn't think it would be
this popular, but I have been proven wrong!!! =).  <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has brought
me a few more callers than I used to have.  I was stuck at 50 for AGES but
now have 70, all thanks to <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> :))).  Keep up the good work guys.&quot;

Excellent news m8...glad to see that advertising your BBS in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is
paying dividends.  As we've said before, and we'll say it again, to all you
SysOps out there who still, despite indisputable proof, think advertising
is a waste of time, you are wasting an opportunity that has been freely
given by <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  Correspondence from SysOps, like the one above, time
after time again, all echo the same message...they have all benefitted from
advertising in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  As Scatman (SysOp Of <a href="forumbbs.html">The Forum BBS</a>) explains
above, he didn't think <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> would be so popular (neither did we), but
its a fundamental fact, that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is becoming increasingly popular
with SysOps and BBS Users alike, the very audience you SysOps need, for your
BBS to survive in this Internet-Dominated industry.

&quot;I have had a few callers mention <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, and I am most grateful to
you for mentioning my BBS in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  I too believe in advertising.
At local Computer Fairs, I hand out well over 500 Leaflets advertising my
BBS, and even a few local Computer Shops have taken Posters from me
advertising my BBS.  One of the Scottish Colleges now uses my BBS to teach
Students how to use Computer Communications other than the Internet, so
advertising does bring rewards, if you are prepared to make the effort.  Let
me know if there is anything I can do to further the cause up here, I'm
always glad to promote the use of the BBS.&quot;

Excellent news m8...people could do no better than follow your example m8!!!
This Correspondence could well be the most inspiring of all Correspondence,
that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has ever received, in that you are the only SysOp we've
heard from that actually has integrated his BBS into the Computer Education
System...well done m8!!!  Further to this, the idea of advertising in Local
Computer Shops and Computer Fairs, is an excellent idea m8, and something
even we at <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> had never thought of, so you can bet your life we're
going to have a go at advertising in OUR Local Computer Shops too!!!

&quot;Please can you ditch that 42K JPEG!!!  If you really must have it, at least
shrink it down to no more than 12K.  42K is ridiculous, and it doubles the
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> archive size!!!&quot;

Point taken m8...QUESTBBS.JPG is included in the <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> archive, to
advertise <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Headquarters.  Yes...it does double the <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">
archive size, and therefore from this Issue, QUESTBBS.JPG has been dropped.
This will not only reduce the <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> archive size for Downloading, but
also will make it easier to distribute <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> through Mail Networks.

&quot;Just been checking out <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> on the Internet, and it's smart!!!  It's
nice to look at, and very easy to use, with only one slight critisism :(
After reading a few pages of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, it became slightly monotonous
having to scroll back to the top of the page to press continue.  How about a
nice little continue button at the bottom of each page?&quot;

You aren't the only <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Reader to have mentioned this m8...and yes,
from this Issue, the HTML Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> WILL have Navigation
Buttons both at the top and bottom of every page.  Thanks for the feedback.
Without feedback, positive or negative, <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has no idea whether it's
delivering the kind of product that YOU, the <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Reader, wants to
read.  So...if you are a <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Reader who wants to voice your opinion
in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, get in touch with us here at the usual E-Mail Addresses,
<a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a> or <a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a>.
