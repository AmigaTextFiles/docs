        <u>Quirky Little World - By Sarah Walls (Co-SysOp Of Quest BBS)</u>

The work that a SysOp puts into his or her BBS is for YOU, the User's
benefit.  They spend hours of their time everyday trying to do their best
for YOU, letting you visit their quirkly little world of Menus, Online-Games
and Graffiti Walls.  It's a very creative personal thing that shows a lot of
themselves, their lives and personalities.  All it takes to make them happy
little SysOps is a User to use their BBS, and to come back again and again,
maybe leaving a message or paging and saying what happy Users they are, and
how much they like all the work and effort you have gone to for them!!!

You may not realise how much time your totally mad SysOps put into their
BBSes.  Just take a minute or maybe two (if you can spare), to think about
all the Files your SysOp puts online, Files that have to have Descriptions
typed in everyday, and the time the SysOp spends chatting with YOU when you
page him/her with a problem, File-Request, or to have a general chit-chat.

SysOps do other things, like spend their money on YOU, getting bigger
Hard-Drives, so they can get more Files online for YOU, the User.  I know my
Husband (SysOp Of <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a>), spent his money last year, buying a 7x CD-ROM
Changer, just so he could share his AMINET CD-ROM Collection with his Users.

Now we're getting to ME, the Co-SysOp of the best BBS in West Yorkshire, yes
you know the one, <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a>.  In all the Issues of the extremely successful
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, no mention has been made about Co-SysOps, so as a long-time
Co-SysOp, I'm about to put this right.  Being a Co-SysOp is not just about
being the SysOps best mate, it's about sharing responsibility for the BBS,
ensuring the SysOp gets your support in the general maintenance of the BBS.
This includes providing your SysOp with new Files to put online for his
Users, and corresponding with Users on the BBS.  Indeed a Co-SysOp is just
as responsible as the SysOp, for ensuring the BBS' success in providing a
service, that Users are willing to come back to, again and again.

So I say &quot;Well Done&quot; to all the Co-SysOps out there, who are supporting
their SysOps, and ultimately helping to keep the UK BBS Scene alive.

Please let people you know, who have Computers and Modems, about BBSes,
maybe give them a copy of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, then they can become Users of BBSes
aswell, and enjoy the friendly personal service that a BBS has to offer.

Thanks...

Sarah Walls (Co-SysOp Of <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a>)
