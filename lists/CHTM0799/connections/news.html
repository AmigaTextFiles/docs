<u>*NEW* CoNnEcTiOnS HTML Version</u>

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is now available in HTML Format.  Shortly after completing the
June Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, we found an AmigaGuide to HTML Convertor on the
AMINET, although not perfect, it was enough to point us in the right
direction to create a fully-functioning HTML Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  After
uploading this to the AMINET, we found that PC Users, using Microsoft's
Internet Explorer, couldn't read it properly, due to an incorrect Background
Colour command.  Apparently the PC's Web-Browsers default to a White
Background, whereas the AMIGA Web-Browsers default to a Grey Background,
which made the White Text in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> disappear into the Background on
the PC!!!  This now has been corrected, and the HTML Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">
now works fine on the PC.  The PC Text-File Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has now
been dropped, as the HTML Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is the nearest we can get
to a PC Executable of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, giving the PC User the chance to read
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> as we originally intended it to be read.  The HTML Version of
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> will be available, along with the AmigaGuide Version, every
month from the AMINET in DOCS/LISTS/.

<u>*NEW* Official CoNnEcTiOnS Web-Sites</u>

Saturday 5th June saw the launch of the First Official <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site
hosted by Dave Clarke.  Using the HTML Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, Dave managed
to put <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> online on HIS own home-page on the Internet, instantly
providing <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> with another resource, where it could be seen and
read.  Dave was also behind the discovery of the Microsoft Internet Explorer
problem, mentioned above, and therefore has been essential in the success of
the HTML Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  The URL Address for this First Official
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site is:-

<a href="http://home.freeuk.net/davecl">http://home.freeuk.net/davecl</a>

Monday 21st June saw the launch of the Second Official <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site
hosted by Paul Green (Ex-SysOp Of The Borg Homeworld BBS).  Paul, who now
runs his own Computer Business (TBH Systems), has joined Dave Clarke, and
added the HTML Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> to HIS own home-page on the Internet.
The URL Address for this Second Official <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site is:-

<a href="http://www.tbhsystems.co.uk/connections">http://www.tbhsystems.co.uk/connections</a>

At this moment in time, neither <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site has the facility for
you to Download <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, but by the time you read this, hopefully, that
will have been sorted, and both Web-Sites will carry archived copies of the
current <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Issue, in both AmigaGuide and HTML Versions.  Anyone
else wanting to host an Official <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site, should get in touch
with <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> at the usual E-Mail Addresses, <a href="questbbs.html">Quest BBS</a> or <a href="bedlambbs.html">Bedlam BBS</a>.

AMIGA FORMAT Magazine has a reader-ship of over 14600, giving <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">
yet an even wider audience than it already receives through the AMINET, the
AMINET CD-ROMs (<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is currently available on AMINET CDs 30 and 31),
UK BBSes, and the Internet via our *NEW* Official <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Sites.

sporting the *NEW* <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> T-Shirt, so look out for us, and don't
