           <u>BBS Information - By Mik (SysOp Of Promised Land BBS)</u>

<u>When did the BBS start?</u>

Well the idea behind Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), came from America and
dates back to the 1970's.

<u>What's a BBS (Apart from fun)?</u>

A Central Computer accessed by a Modem, is used to store Files for people
to read or Download.  It works just like a Notice Board.  Since the early
days, the idea of the BBS has been transformed from a simple message service
to a fully interactive Computer System.  With improved Software, such as
MAX's Professional 2.11 (Now Public-Domain) +:), things have come a long way
since the 1970's. 

<u>Files &amp; Transfer</u>
  
One of the most popular area of all BBSes are the directories of Software,
Downloadable by using one of several methods of transferring Files.  The
most efficient method is ZMODEM, its one of most reliable ones, as all Data
is subject to rigorous checksums.  XMODEM is designed to transfer binary
(8-bit) Files.  Advanced Systems do transmit the full 8-Byte, and therefore
support ZMODEM.  Some even support other File transfer protocols, such as
YMODEM-Batch and Kermit, but in addition to supporting binary transfers,
both can transfer Filenames aswell.  This way you can Download 20 or more
Files with one simple command, and the transfer does the rest.

<u>Doors</u>

These are used by the Software, making the BBS better.  There are many
around and every BBS usually carries a large list of what's available -
Doors can be Games, Utilities etc.  There are also Doors for adding CD-ROMs
to the BBS, making the BBS Filebase grow.  Some Doors require Key-Files and
will not function without them such as LSD and NSA Doors for MAX's BBS :(

<u>Games</u>

Games are run in the same way as Doors, but that depends on the Door
functions!  The first ever Game was the Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) and lived
Essex University's mainframe.  There are now hundreds of Doors available,
and thanks to coders like Marty (SysOp Of Gremlins BBS) and C Wilson
(SysOp Of Amiga Phoenix BBS), Doors have got much better :)

<u>Mail Networks</u>

The BBS can be connected to Mail Networks via Hubs, Points, and Nodes.
These are names given to the different types of mail distributors.  Hubs are
the main distributer for Mail Networks.  Examples of current Mail Networks
are FidoNet, FluffyNet and PowerNet.

<u>Last words from Mik (SysOp Of Promised Land BBS)</u>

I run the <a href="promisedlandbbs.html">Promised Land BBS</a> using MAX's Professional 2.08.  I carry both
FluffyNet and PowerNet Mail Networks.  I will give my support to anyone
wishing to start a BBS.  I've got a fully-working *FREE* Beginner's BBS,
already configured, for any Caller that wants to start their own BBS.  You
can Download the *FREE* Information from <a href="promisedlandbbs.html">Promised Land BBS</a>, all YOU need to
do is fill the Information in, and return it, I will do the ANSIs for you.
Finally, I would like to thank the following people for their help and
support since I started <a href="promisedlandbbs.html">Promised Land BBS</a>:-

Steve Clack, Ben Dover, Dunkie, Pete Laird, Leon, Marty, Niki Murkett,
Ninja, Timm Rutland, S.N.S, and anyone else I've missed!!!
