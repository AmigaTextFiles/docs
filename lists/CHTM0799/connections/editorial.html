Welcome to Issue Five of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  Each month <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> gets bigger
and better, thanks to <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers who take the time to contribute
Articles and Correspondence.  This Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, is a little later
than anticipated, due to the fact that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has been very busy this
month.  Not only have we delivered the *EXCLUSIVE* <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> AMIGA FORMAT
Special-Edition to AMIGA FORMAT Magazine, but we have created a *NEW* HTML
Version of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, which ultimately lead to the launch of two Official
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Sites this month, operated by <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers, Dave
Clarke and Paul Green.  Thankyou guys!!!

The fact that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Readers have approached <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, volunteering
to host an Official <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> Web-Site, is indisputable proof, that the
popularity of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is on the increase, something that SysOps should
seriously consider, if they haven't yet registered their BBSes with us here,
at <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">!!!

This Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> features more Scottish BBSes, thanks to Steven
Winetrobe (SysOp Of <a href="sodbbs.html">SoD BBS Blantyre</a>), who provided <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> with
details of many Scottish BBSes, that were still serving the UK BBS Scene.
The fact that we haven't discovered these long-time BBSes until now, leads
us to believe that there are still many BBSes out there in the UK, which as
yet, do not appear in <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  This is where we need YOUR help!!!  We
need to know from SysOps and BBS Users alike, about any BBSes you either
operate or frequent, that aren't listed in this Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.

Remember, <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is getting wide-spread coverage, and that wide-spread
coverage is helping to increase the popularity of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, and that can
only be good news for the current UK BBS Scene.  We especially would like
more information on Welsh &amp; Irish BBSes, as <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> appears to present
a very bleak picture on the UK BBS Scene in these areas, so if YOU can help
put the record straight, then please, please, please get in touch ASAP!!!

Last, but not least, <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> would like to yet again thank AMIGA FORMAT
Magazine, in particular Ben Vost (Editor Of AMIGA FORMAT Magazine), for
his continual support for the UK BBS Scene.  With <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> now being
delivered to AMIGA FORMAT Magazine every month, for inclusion on their
Cover-Mounted CD-ROMs, <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> hopes that this new distribution will
reap rewards for AMIGA FORMAT Magazine, just as much as <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, and
ultimately breathe new life into the UK BBS Scene, something that we at
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> set out to do from the very first Issue!!!

See you Next Issue...
