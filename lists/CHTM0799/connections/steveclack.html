    <u>Atlantis BBS Software - By Steve Clack (SysOp Of Total Eclipse BBS)</u>

                  -======================================-
                           Atlantis BBS Software
                    Written by Tom Bampton &amp; Steve Clack
                  -======================================-

Atlantis was born out of a desire to make our BBSes do more.  For many
years we have stuck with MAX's because of its ease of use, and its speed.
Over the years many people have tried to bring MAX's up-to-date, giving it
the features that everybody needs today.  Whilst being good to a degree,
they all have a major failing...they're based on the original MAX's sources.

Atlantis is completely new, it was written from the ground up with
compatibility in mind.  Atlantis is 99% compatible with MAX's Doors, and
features SinkMaxs: the BBS transplant software.  Quite simply, it takes your
MAX's BBS, looks at it, thinks about it, then spews out a complete working
Atlantis BBS that functions as much as is possible as your MAX's version.
It will then tell you of areas you can benefit from using new Atlantis
features, and will give you a run through of Atlantis administration.

Atlantis combines the ease of MAX's with the power of modern technology, it
allows you to make your BBS something special.  With Atlantis, you have the
choice of how your BBS looks.  You can run it in HotKey Menu mode, like
MAX's BBS, or you can run it in Prompt mode, like CNet and /X.  Whichever
mode you use, you have the option of creating conferences as well as the
usual file/message areas.  From Atlantis Dispatch, you have complete control
over the entire BBS.  You can see at a glance your BBS' statistics, you can
see everyone logged into your board, the status of your Modems and the days
log-files.  You can control any node singly or all together, you can run an
unlimited amount of local logins, send online messages and chat to users
without having to open their screen!  You can watch what your users are
doing, you can even run a built-in crash recovery routine if a Door has
crashed.  Only a mouse click away is all the utility programs supplied with
Atlantis, such as the Configuration program and User Editor.

Here's a short summary of features.  There is a hell of a lot more than
this, to list them all would take forever.

 o 100% System Friendly -- No dodgy serial/audio hacks a la MAX's.

 o Uses standard WB2.04+ interface.

 o Automatically uses WB3.0+ features when running on WB3.0+ to make things
   run faster and look nicer.

 o 99% MAX's Compatible.

 o The XPR standard is supported.  You can select which XPRs to use.

 o The core of Atlantis is held in a library, which allows it to run faster
   and be updated more easily.

 o No clock -- Yes, thats a feature :)

 o Unlimited Nodes.

 o Upto 255 MAX's/Paragon compatible doors, and an unlimited number of
   Atlantis compatible doors running *at the same time*.
   
 o Door port numbers are seperate to the node number, which means you can
   run a door on node 9867 with no problems.

 o File and Message bases are external, and can be completely customized.
 
 o The filebase is based on MagicFile.  You can do file stuff in the same
   way as MAX's too, if your a massachist.

 o The message base looks and feels like a desktop mailer package, and
   allows a similar degree of customization for users.  You can do mail
   stuff in the same way as MAX's too, if your a massachist.

 o Full Internet support.  This includes BBS-based versions of the WWW, FTP,
   and more.  Also, some popular Internet servers are provided also.

 o Full Fido style mail network support.

 o BBS can be spawned from TrapDoor or Telnet, as well as standard Modem
   connections.

 o Full Internet EMail support (clients AND servers).
 
 o TrapDoor support.

 o OPTIONAL Conference support.

 o Official Support BBS for when you get stuck.

 o Good programmers docs -- Everything is documented, no more hacking!

 o Everything you will ever need to program anything for Atlantis is
   accessible through the core library.

 o atldoors.library -- The definitive door pack.  It will automatically
   detect the system it's talking to and adjust to suit.  This means your
   door runs the same whatever BBS software it's running on.  C, Assembler
   and AMOS packs are provided.
 
 o Paragon has an EditFile door function.  In MAX's, this doesn't work.
   Atlantis supports this fully.

 o Editors are external, which means you can select which editors you want
   to be available on your BBS.
