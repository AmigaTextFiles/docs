                          @{b}@{u}I N T R O D U C T I O N@{ub}@{uu}

Welcome to the Fifth Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is a Monthly
UK BBS Scene Magazine containing a comprehensive UK BBS Directory.

Many SysOps have tried their hands at generating up-to-date BBS Lists, but
most have found them too difficult to maintain and have abandoned updating
them, with the exception of the odd few, like Turbo D at @{BG fill}@{"Alpha Zone BBS" Link AlphaZoneBBS}@{BG background}
who has for the last 8 months supplied a list of BBS Numbers to the AMINET.

However, most BBS Lists contain BBS Numbers of BBSes that have long since
left the scene, and of all the Lists we have encountered, there hasn't
been one that has been accurately up-to-date.

At the time of going to press, ALL the BBSes listed in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} have
been 100% verified as being online.  We have spent the last 6 months
ringing BBS Numbers to find out which BBSes are still online, and to find
out those that have left the scene.  We have still a lot of work to do,
but I'm sure you can appreciate the cost of dialling every BBS Number we
have found in the afore mentioned BBS Lists, and that is why we need YOUR
help in providing us with information of any BBSes you know that are still
online, that are not listed in this Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

Furthermore, we need YOUR help in keeping @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} up-to-date with BBS
Closures, New Numbers, Relaunches, Renames etc.  For more details on how
to contact us, access @{BG fill}@{"Submissions" Link Submissions}@{BG background}.

The BBS Scene is in bad need of positive publicity...and we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
strongly believe that BBS Advertising is a damn good start.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
aims to provide the AMIGA Community with a central resource of information
regarding the current status of the UK BBS Scene, with the added bonus of a
comprehensive UK BBS Directory every month.

When we first researched for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to find out just how many BBSes
were still up and running, we were pleasantly suprised by the number we
found were still online, and those 124 BBSes we found, were entered into
the First Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  That 124 BBSes has now grown to 197 BBSes
for the Fifth Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, just proving that the UK BBS Scene is
far from dead, as was first thought. 

From our point of view, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has really made a difference to the
number of Calls and New Users at our respective BBSes, and many of our New
Users had never been on a BBS before in their lives, the Internet, yes, but
never a BBS, as they thought that BBSes were extinct.  Feedback from other
SysOps who advertised in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} suggests that they have experienced the
same result, which proves a point, that SysOps should not just sit back and
accept the number of Users in their User-Base, but should advertise their
BBSes as much as possible, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} giving them that very chance.

AMIGA FORMAT Magazine recently started a column for BBS Numbers in their
Readers Adverts section, and those that have advertised, including
ourselves, have found that advertising DOES work, and that there ARE
members of the AMIGA Community who want to call BBSes, but never knew
where to get in contact with them!  Therefore in respect of all you SysOps
that think that advertising is a waste of time...we rest our case!!!

The Internet has done much damage to the UK BBS Scene, especially when Free
ISPs were launched, but that damage is not irrepairable, as we have proven,
and ironically @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has used the Internet to get to it's prospective
audience, to get Internet Users back to the UK BBS Scene, and it appears to
have worked, and worked well.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been well received from SysOps and BBS Users alike, and the
Correspondence we have received from Readers has been tremendous.  We
honestly didn't believe that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would be so popular, and its
thanks to your input and feedback that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has established itself
as the leading UK BBS Scene Magazine after only it's Fourth Issue!!!

Plans to take @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}' coverage beyond the United Kingdom are already
under consideration.  Work on @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has already started, but
we foresee a problem that really needs to be addressed before we continue
any further with the project.  Basically, does the UK BBS Scene really want
an International BBS Directory?  If the answer to this questions is "Yes",
then how do we market it?  Do we release it seperately, to give YOU the
choice whether you want to Download it or not, or do we include it within
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, bearing in mind the Archive Size will probably double?

Please help us to make this decision, get in touch with us at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text},
and let us know what YOU want.  If we get no response from YOU, as Readers
of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then the @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} project will be scrapped!!!

Please keep the Correspondence coming, we would especially like to hear from
SysOps who have advertised their BBSes in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and have benefitted
as a result.  Also, if any of you have any ideas on how we can improve the
content of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, or if you have anything at all to contribute to
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then please get in touch, even if you only have a sentence or
two to say, ALL Correspondence will be read and replied to, and may even
get included in the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!

See you Next Issue...

@{u}*NEW* CoNnEcTiOnS HTML Version@{uu}

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is now available in HTML Format.  Shortly after completing the
June Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, we found an AmigaGuide to HTML Convertor on the
AMINET, although not perfect, it was enough to point us in the right
direction to create a fully-functioning HTML Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  After
uploading this to the AMINET, we found that PC Users, using Microsoft's
Internet Explorer, couldn't read it properly, due to an incorrect Background
Colour command.  Apparently the PC's Web-Browsers default to a White
Background, whereas the AMIGA Web-Browsers default to a Grey Background,
which made the White Text in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} disappear into the Background on
the PC!!!  This now has been corrected, and the HTML Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
now works fine on the PC.  The PC Text-File Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has now
been dropped, as the HTML Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is the nearest we can get
to a PC Executable of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, giving the PC User the chance to read
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} as we originally intended it to be read.  The HTML Version of
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} will be available, along with the AmigaGuide Version, every
month from the AMINET in DOCS/LISTS/.

@{u}*NEW* Official CoNnEcTiOnS Web-Sites@{uu}

Saturday 5th June saw the launch of the First Official @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site
hosted by Dave Clarke.  Using the HTML Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, Dave managed
to put @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} online on HIS own home-page on the Internet, instantly
providing @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} with another resource, where it could be seen and
read.  Dave was also behind the discovery of the Microsoft Internet Explorer
problem, mentioned above, and therefore has been essential in the success of
the HTML Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  The URL Address for this First Official
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site is:-

http://home.freeuk.net/davecl

Monday 21st June saw the launch of the Second Official @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site
hosted by Paul Green (Ex-SysOp Of The Borg Homeworld BBS).  Paul, who now
runs his own Computer Business (TBH Systems), has joined Dave Clarke, and
added the HTML Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to HIS own home-page on the Internet.
The URL Address for this Second Official @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site is:-

http://www.tbhsystems.co.uk/connections

At this moment in time, neither @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site has the facility for
you to Download @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, but by the time you read this, hopefully, that
will have been sorted, and both Web-Sites will carry archived copies of the
current @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Issue, in both AmigaGuide and HTML Versions.  Anyone
else wanting to host an Official @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site, should get in touch
with @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} at the usual E-Mail Addresses, @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background} or @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}.

Welcome to Issue Five of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  Each month @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} gets bigger
and better, thanks to @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers who take the time to contribute
Articles and Correspondence.  This Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, is a little later
than anticipated, due to the fact that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been very busy this
month.  Not only have we delivered the *EXCLUSIVE* @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} AMIGA FORMAT
Special-Edition to AMIGA FORMAT Magazine, but we have created a *NEW* HTML
Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, which ultimately lead to the launch of two Official
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Sites this month, operated by @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers, Dave
Clarke and Paul Green.  Thankyou guys!!!

The fact that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers have approached @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, volunteering
to host an Official @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site, is indisputable proof, that the
popularity of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is on the increase, something that SysOps should
seriously consider, if they haven't yet registered their BBSes with us here,
at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!

This Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} features more Scottish BBSes, thanks to Steven
Winetrobe (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"SoD BBS Blantyre" Link SoDBBS}@{BG background}), who provided @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} with
details of many Scottish BBSes, that were still serving the UK BBS Scene.
The fact that we haven't discovered these long-time BBSes until now, leads
us to believe that there are still many BBSes out there in the UK, which as
yet, do not appear in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  This is where we need YOUR help!!!  We
need to know from SysOps and BBS Users alike, about any BBSes you either
operate or frequent, that aren't listed in this Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

Remember, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is getting wide-spread coverage, and that wide-spread
coverage is helping to increase the popularity of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and that can
only be good news for the current UK BBS Scene.  We especially would like
more information on Welsh & Irish BBSes, as @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} appears to present
a very bleak picture on the UK BBS Scene in these areas, so if YOU can help
put the record straight, then please, please, please get in touch ASAP!!!

Last, but not least, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would like to yet again thank AMIGA FORMAT
Magazine, in particular Ben Vost (Editor Of AMIGA FORMAT Magazine), for
his continual support for the UK BBS Scene.  With @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} now being
delivered to AMIGA FORMAT Magazine every month, for inclusion on their
Cover-Mounted CD-ROMs, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} hopes that this new distribution will
reap rewards for AMIGA FORMAT Magazine, just as much as @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and
ultimately breathe new life into the UK BBS Scene, something that we at
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} set out to do from the very first Issue!!!

See you Next Issue...

                  -======================================-
                           Atlantis BBS Software
                    Written by Tom Bampton & Steve Clack
                  -======================================-

Atlantis was born out of a desire to make our BBSes do more.  For many
years we have stuck with MAX's because of its ease of use, and its speed.
Over the years many people have tried to bring MAX's up-to-date, giving it
the features that everybody needs today.  Whilst being good to a degree,
they all have a major failing...they're based on the original MAX's sources.

Atlantis is completely new, it was written from the ground up with
compatibility in mind.  Atlantis is 99% compatible with MAX's Doors, and
features SinkMaxs: the BBS transplant software.  Quite simply, it takes your
MAX's BBS, looks at it, thinks about it, then spews out a complete working
Atlantis BBS that functions as much as is possible as your MAX's version.
It will then tell you of areas you can benefit from using new Atlantis
features, and will give you a run through of Atlantis administration.

Atlantis combines the ease of MAX's with the power of modern technology, it
allows you to make your BBS something special.  With Atlantis, you have the
choice of how your BBS looks.  You can run it in HotKey Menu mode, like
MAX's BBS, or you can run it in Prompt mode, like CNet and /X.  Whichever
mode you use, you have the option of creating conferences as well as the
usual file/message areas.  From Atlantis Dispatch, you have complete control
over the entire BBS.  You can see at a glance your BBS' statistics, you can
see everyone logged into your board, the status of your Modems and the days
log-files.  You can control any node singly or all together, you can run an
unlimited amount of local logins, send online messages and chat to users
without having to open their screen!  You can watch what your users are
doing, you can even run a built-in crash recovery routine if a Door has
crashed.  Only a mouse click away is all the utility programs supplied with
Atlantis, such as the Configuration program and User Editor.

Here's a short summary of features.  There is a hell of a lot more than
this, to list them all would take forever.

 o 100% System Friendly -- No dodgy serial/audio hacks a la MAX's.

 o Uses standard WB2.04+ interface.

 o Automatically uses WB3.0+ features when running on WB3.0+ to make things
   run faster and look nicer.

 o 99% MAX's Compatible.

 o The XPR standard is supported.  You can select which XPRs to use.

 o The core of Atlantis is held in a library, which allows it to run faster
   and be updated more easily.

 o No clock -- Yes, thats a feature :)

 o Unlimited Nodes.

 o Upto 255 MAX's/Paragon compatible doors, and an unlimited number of
   Atlantis compatible doors running *at the same time*.
   
 o Door port numbers are seperate to the node number, which means you can
   run a door on node 9867 with no problems.

 o File and Message bases are external, and can be completely customized.
 
 o The filebase is based on MagicFile.  You can do file stuff in the same
   way as MAX's too, if your a massachist.

 o The message base looks and feels like a desktop mailer package, and
   allows a similar degree of customization for users.  You can do mail
   stuff in the same way as MAX's too, if your a massachist.

 o Full Internet support.  This includes BBS-based versions of the WWW, FTP,
   and more.  Also, some popular Internet servers are provided also.

 o Full Fido style mail network support.

 o BBS can be spawned from TrapDoor or Telnet, as well as standard Modem
   connections.

 o Full Internet EMail support (clients AND servers).
 
 o TrapDoor support.

 o OPTIONAL Conference support.

 o Official Support BBS for when you get stuck.

 o Good programmers docs -- Everything is documented, no more hacking!

 o Everything you will ever need to program anything for Atlantis is
   accessible through the core library.

 o atldoors.library -- The definitive door pack.  It will automatically
   detect the system it's talking to and adjust to suit.  This means your
   door runs the same whatever BBS software it's running on.  C, Assembler
   and AMOS packs are provided.
 
 o Paragon has an EditFile door function.  In MAX's, this doesn't work.
   Atlantis supports this fully.

 o Editors are external, which means you can select which editors you want
   to be available on your BBS.

If you'd like more information on Atlantis, please contact Fosters on
FluffyNET or directly at @{BG fill}@{"Total Eclipse BBS" Link TotalEclipseBBS}@{BG background}.  Alternatively, you can E-Mail
Fosters at atlantis@dvalley.demon.co.uk.  We welcome your suggestions for
features!

           @{u}BBS Information - By Mik (SysOp Of Promised Land BBS)@{uu}

@{u}When did the BBS start?@{uu}

Well the idea behind Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), came from America and
dates back to the 1970's.

@{u}What's a BBS (Apart from fun)?@{uu}

A Central Computer accessed by a Modem, is used to store Files for people
to read or Download.  It works just like a Notice Board.  Since the early
days, the idea of the BBS has been transformed from a simple message service
to a fully interactive Computer System.  With improved Software, such as
MAX's Professional 2.11 (Now Public-Domain) +:), things have come a long way
since the 1970's. 

@{u}Files & Transfer@{uu}
  
One of the most popular area of all BBSes are the directories of Software,
Downloadable by using one of several methods of transferring Files.  The
most efficient method is ZMODEM, its one of most reliable ones, as all Data
is subject to rigorous checksums.  XMODEM is designed to transfer binary
(8-bit) Files.  Advanced Systems do transmit the full 8-Byte, and therefore
support ZMODEM.  Some even support other File transfer protocols, such as
YMODEM-Batch and Kermit, but in addition to supporting binary transfers,
both can transfer Filenames aswell.  This way you can Download 20 or more
Files with one simple command, and the transfer does the rest.

@{u}Doors@{uu}

These are used by the Software, making the BBS better.  There are many
around and every BBS usually carries a large list of what's available -
Doors can be Games, Utilities etc.  There are also Doors for adding CD-ROMs
to the BBS, making the BBS Filebase grow.  Some Doors require Key-Files and
will not function without them such as LSD and NSA Doors for MAX's BBS :(

@{u}Games@{uu}

Games are run in the same way as Doors, but that depends on the Door
functions!  The first ever Game was the Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) and lived
Essex University's mainframe.  There are now hundreds of Doors available,
and thanks to coders like Marty (SysOp Of Gremlins BBS) and C Wilson
(SysOp Of Amiga Phoenix BBS), Doors have got much better :)

@{u}Mail Networks@{uu}

The BBS can be connected to Mail Networks via Hubs, Points, and Nodes.
These are names given to the different types of mail distributors.  Hubs are
the main distributer for Mail Networks.  Examples of current Mail Networks
are FidoNet, FluffyNet and PowerNet.

@{u}Last words from Mik (SysOp Of Promised Land BBS)@{uu}

I run the @{BG fill}@{"Promised Land BBS" Link PromisedLandBBS}@{BG background} using MAX's Professional 2.08.  I carry both
FluffyNet and PowerNet Mail Networks.  I will give my support to anyone
wishing to start a BBS.  I've got a fully-working *FREE* Beginner's BBS,
already configured, for any Caller that wants to start their own BBS.  You
can Download the *FREE* Information from @{BG fill}@{"Promised Land BBS" Link PromisedLandBBS}@{BG background}, all YOU need to
do is fill the Information in, and return it, I will do the ANSIs for you.
Finally, I would like to thank the following people for their help and
support since I started @{BG fill}@{"Promised Land BBS" Link PromisedLandBBS}@{BG background}:-

Steve Clack, Ben Dover, Dunkie, Pete Laird, Leon, Marty, Niki Murkett,
Ninja, Timm Rutland, S.N.S, and anyone else I've missed!!!

        @{u}Quirky Little World - By Sarah Walls (Co-SysOp Of Quest BBS)@{uu}

The work that a SysOp puts into his or her BBS is for YOU, the User's
benefit.  They spend hours of their time everyday trying to do their best
for YOU, letting you visit their quirkly little world of Menus, Online-Games
and Graffiti Walls.  It's a very creative personal thing that shows a lot of
themselves, their lives and personalities.  All it takes to make them happy
little SysOps is a User to use their BBS, and to come back again and again,
maybe leaving a message or paging and saying what happy Users they are, and
how much they like all the work and effort you have gone to for them!!!

You may not realise how much time your totally mad SysOps put into their
BBSes.  Just take a minute or maybe two (if you can spare), to think about
all the Files your SysOp puts online, Files that have to have Descriptions
typed in everyday, and the time the SysOp spends chatting with YOU when you
page him/her with a problem, File-Request, or to have a general chit-chat.

SysOps do other things, like spend their money on YOU, getting bigger
Hard-Drives, so they can get more Files online for YOU, the User.  I know my
Husband (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}), spent his money last year, buying a 7x CD-ROM
Changer, just so he could share his AMINET CD-ROM Collection with his Users.

Now we're getting to ME, the Co-SysOp of the best BBS in West Yorkshire, yes
you know the one, @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}.  In all the Issues of the extremely successful
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, no mention has been made about Co-SysOps, so as a long-time
Co-SysOp, I'm about to put this right.  Being a Co-SysOp is not just about
being the SysOps best mate, it's about sharing responsibility for the BBS,
ensuring the SysOp gets your support in the general maintenance of the BBS.
This includes providing your SysOp with new Files to put online for his
Users, and corresponding with Users on the BBS.  Indeed a Co-SysOp is just
as responsible as the SysOp, for ensuring the BBS' success in providing a
service, that Users are willing to come back to, again and again.

So I say "Well Done" to all the Co-SysOps out there, who are supporting
their SysOps, and ultimately helping to keep the UK BBS Scene alive.

Please let people you know, who have Computers and Modems, about BBSes,
maybe give them a copy of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then they can become Users of BBSes
aswell, and enjoy the friendly personal service that a BBS has to offer.

Thanks...

"I remember when Dunkie and Pete first thought of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, it was talked
about on Fluffynet some time ago.  To be honest I didn't think it would be

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

Excellent news m8...glad to see that advertising your BBS in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is
paying dividends.  As we've said before, and we'll say it again, to all you
SysOps out there who still, despite indisputable proof, think advertising
is a waste of time, you are wasting an opportunity that has been freely
given by @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  Correspondence from SysOps, like the one above, time
after time again, all echo the same message...they have all benefitted from
advertising in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  As Scatman (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"The Forum BBS" Link ForumBBS}@{BG background}) explains
above, he didn't think @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would be so popular (neither did we), but
its a fundamental fact, that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is becoming increasingly popular
with SysOps and BBS Users alike, the very audience you SysOps need, for your
BBS to survive in this Internet-Dominated industry.

"I have had a few callers mention @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and I am most grateful to
you for mentioning my BBS in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  I too believe in advertising.
At local Computer Fairs, I hand out well over 500 Leaflets advertising my
BBS, and even a few local Computer Shops have taken Posters from me
advertising my BBS.  One of the Scottish Colleges now uses my BBS to teach
Students how to use Computer Communications other than the Internet, so
advertising does bring rewards, if you are prepared to make the effort.  Let
me know if there is anything I can do to further the cause up here, I'm
always glad to promote the use of the BBS."

Excellent news m8...people could do no better than follow your example m8!!!
This Correspondence could well be the most inspiring of all Correspondence,
that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has ever received, in that you are the only SysOp we've
heard from that actually has integrated his BBS into the Computer Education
System...well done m8!!!  Further to this, the idea of advertising in Local
Computer Shops and Computer Fairs, is an excellent idea m8, and something
even we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} had never thought of, so you can bet your life we're
going to have a go at advertising in OUR Local Computer Shops too!!!

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

Point taken m8...QUESTBBS.JPG is included in the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} archive, to
advertise @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Headquarters.  Yes...it does double the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
archive size, and therefore from this Issue, QUESTBBS.JPG has been dropped.
This will not only reduce the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} archive size for Downloading, but
also will make it easier to distribute @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} through Mail Networks.

"Just been checking out @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} on the Internet, and it's smart!!!  It's
nice to look at, and very easy to use, with only one slight critisism :(
After reading a few pages of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, it became slightly monotonous
having to scroll back to the top of the page to press continue.  How about a
nice little continue button at the bottom of each page?"

 Very generous BBS...You have 255 minutes of online time per day/per call
 and you can download 100 files before having to upload anything...

       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       | The CIRCLE BBS online times and calling information:       |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       | Monday -> Thursday : 00:00 -> 07:00 hrs  : NORMAL DIALLING |
       |                                                            |
       | ALL OTHER TIMES    : The BBS uses RINGBACK (see below).    |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+

       (Normal dialling means:- just call as you would any other BBS)

 USING THE CIRCLE BBS RINGBACK:

 Call the BBS and let the phone ring once, immediately HANG UP.
 Wait 15-20 seconds for the BBS to be loaded.
 Call the BBS again and you'll be connected.
 Please don't just call it as normal - I'll think it's a voice call
 and you'll hear "Hello?" through your modem speaker! ;)

 If you really are a complete anorak, you can play ANSI BBS games.  Enjoy
 yourself and make BT richer while the rest of us go to Dixons and buy a
 PlayStation for 99 quid.

 *EPILOGUE*

 Frost Free is a BBS, it has Files on CD, it has important files not on CD,
 it also carries mail and the SysOp will look after you.

 Thank you.

 Dave Naylor (The SysOp of Frost Free) (Honest)
