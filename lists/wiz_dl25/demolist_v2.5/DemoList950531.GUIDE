Many people have given their best to finish all the productions listed in
this demolist. I've collected demos since 1989. If I have had the amount
of disks needed all through those years this collection would have been
at least three times BIGGER. But now it is here, not too big but surely 
with most majors released in the last couple of years. If you, like me, 
find it interesting to collect demos and maybe you're tired of swapping 
"EliTE WaReZ", then contact me. If you have productions which are in the 
wanted list or too good to be left out please send'em over right away. 
I will of course return your disks with your requests copied onto them.
As an extra bonus your name will be added to the history-list in the next 
issue of this demolisting.
My absolutely best regards goes to all the groups/persons whom have worked
hard to finish their products. The scene would be nothing without you!
I just can't think of a scene with ONLY bigmouths and mega-super-traders
trying to prove how cool they are. That's where the swedish scene is today.
I surely hope it will be able to recover and gain some of it's good 
reputation back. Don't let the (swedish) demoscene die!
Many thanks for reading this and do your best to spread this demolist to 
everybody interested in the wonderful world of demos. 

See you in coming editions of this listing!

This list may be freely distributed as long as no changes are made to its
contents. If you want to sell this list, feel free to do so. I guess nobody
will pay to get this production anyway! :-) If you want to get an updated
version of this list just give me a hint and I'll make you happy.

Iam also very interested in all video-demos ever released! More pictures
from THE PARTY 4 are also of great value. Don't hesitate to contact me for
everything concerning this list or the demoscene in general. But, if you're
sending disks PLEASE make sure they are 100% error free. I don't want any
broken swap-disks. From now on, only completely functional versions of the
production will be added to the list.

On Aug. 5-8, 1993, a demo party called ECC (European Computer Conference)
was held in Oerebro, Sweden.  Arrangers were a group called Virtual, and
the party was officially sponsored by Swedish Commodore.  Over 600 visitors
showed up.  TV21 showed up as well and went around interviewing a lot of
people.  (A few weeks later they showed some demos from the competition
along with the interviews on their Friday night show 'Metamorph'.)

"Quartex Silents Anarchy, The Party 1991"

 The Party 1991 was held between December 27th and 29th, 1991 in Aars,
 Denmark.  At that time the C64 was still well represented at parties, and
 the demo competitions for the C64 and Amiga were almost the same size.
 1250 people visited the party, which made it quite a big party.  It
 has since only been exceeded by The Party II.

 Not much information was written down about the Party in 1991, only the
 2 demos with the highest ranking.  Odyssey was a long demo, a kind of
 space quest, and Hard Wired placed Silents on top of the charts for
 years!

"Crystal Silents Anarchy, The Party 1992, Part II, The Final"

 The Party II, a demo coders' gathering was held between December 27th and
 29th, 1992 in Aars, Denmark.

 2500 scene people from the whole world visited the party, which
 confirmed its status as an international party, and the biggest one.

 Three types of demos were submitted: demo and intro competitions,
 and other releases. The intros are smaller than 40KBytes.  The releases
 didn't participate any competitions, and consist mostly of disk-mags
 and compilation disks.

 A general rule for productions for the competitions was that they
 should run on an A500 with 1MB of memory, either 1MB chip ram, or with
 0.5MB chip ram and 0.5MB fast ram.

 The party also hosted music and graphics competition and competitions
 for the C64 and IBM-compatibles.

Once again this big christmas party was held in Denmark between the 27th
and 30th of December. As always it was a major success, this time with
about 2500 visitors. PC started to get closer to the Amiga but the 
Amiga still held on to its number one spot.

This party held in Nykoping, Sweden between the 31/3 and 2/4 wasn't any
big success. Only 150 visitors and no good competitions. The reason might
have been that the Gathering'95 in Norway is only half a month away.
At the party a CD with Amiga-music called "Best Of The Amiga Scene" was
released. It is a great celebration to the Amiga, with 18 classic Amiga
tracks. If you want to have your own copy of this CD, get in touch with
Orgasmatron/X-Trade or Snuskis/DCS Graphics.

Demos Of The World isn't only the name of this listing. It is also the name 
of a demopack which i produced a couple of years ago. At that time it was
one of the leading demopacks and in my opinion well before all others in
development. 
I hope you will enjoy this bonuslisting of as much as I enjoyed making this
demopack series!
