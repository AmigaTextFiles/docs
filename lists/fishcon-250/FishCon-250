ARTM            ARTM (Amiga Real Time Monitor) displays and controls
                system activity such as tasks, windows, libraries, devices,
                resources, ports, residents, interrupts, and vectors.

Icon            A high-level programming language with extensive facilities
                for processing strings and lists. Icon has several novel
                features, including expressions that may produce sequences
                of results, goal-directed evaluation that automatically
                searches for a successful result, and string scanning that
                allows operations on strings to be formulated at a high
                conceptual level.  Icon resembles SNOBOL4 in its emphasis on
                high-level string processing and a design philosophy that
                allows ease of programming and short, concise programs.
                This is version 7.5 of the public domain implementation of
                Icon from the University of Arizona.  It is an update to
                disk 81.  Binary only.

LPE             LaTeX Picture Editor is a graphical editor for producing
                "pictures" for the LaTeX system, which may be imported by
                LaTeX.  You can draw boxes, dashed boxes, lines, vectors,
                circles, boxes with centered text, and plain text.  This
                is an update to version 1.0 on disk 243, and
                includes some new drawing tools, enhanced user interface
                features, optimized code, and some bug fixes.  Binary only.

WBAssign        A small WorkBench program that creates AmigaDOS assignments
                without having to open a CLI.  Assignments may be made by
                specifying a complete path (as supported by the CLI command),
                or by specifying a path relative to the current directory.
                This allows a program and its assigns to be moved easily.
                In addition, WBAssign can create assigns specified in the
                icon files of other programs located anywhere in the system.
                Version 1.20, binary only.
                Author:  John Gerlach Jr.

WBRes           A program that allows WorkBench users to have resident
                programs, as in the resident capability of WShell, the

AmigaTrek       Three stories which are a parody of the Star Trek series,

ASpice          A version of the SPICE 2G.6 circuit analysis program
                which has been modified to run in the Amiga environment.
                The program arrays are adjusted to require one tenth the
                memory of the DEC VAX version.  Although this does not
                usually put much of a constraint on circuit analysis,
                some users who are used to the full mainframe environment
                may have to be more aware of the memory demands of their
                analysis.  Requires a minimum  of 1 MB memory.  This
                version neither supports nor requires the 68020 processor
                or 68881 coprocessor.  This is an update to disk 177.
                Version 5.1.  Binary only.

Berserker       A virus detection program that can detect various forms
                of the common bootblock and link type viruses.  Rather
                than checking for a specific virus, it looks for conditions
                that indicate a possible virus infection, thus it can
                detect new strains of similar viruses.

CM              A celestial mechanics simulator with an Intuition
                interface.  You construct a layout of celestial bodies
                and specify various parameters for the bodies and the
                simulation.  CM then animates the bodies according to
                the laws of gravitational attraction.  Setups may be
                saved to disk to later reinact interesting scenarios.
                Version 1.0, includes source.

IconTools       Here are some tools for icon tricks.  Note that these tools

                clear or reset upon loading the icon.  There are three
                programs here which allow WorkBench drawer windows to appear
                in non-standard colors and allow you to move the position
                of the file name text to anywhere in the icon's graphic.
                Released to the public in the hope that 1.4 will allow more

                using a set of commands that instruct Scripit to simulate
                specific mouse or keyboard actions.  Also has an ARexx port,
                so it can be driven by ARexx allowing ARexx control over
                programs that do not have ARexx ports.  Includes both a

TreeWalk        A command for visiting all the files of a subtree of an

                the file passes through the filter, to issue the specified
                command with that file as one of the arguments.  It is
                designed to be reasonably fast, robust, and not use a
