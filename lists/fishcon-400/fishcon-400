                for additional serial ports, external file transfer protocols

ATCopy          A program to copy files from the Amiga side of a system
                equipped with a PC/AT bridgeboard, to the PC side, using
                wildcards.  Copies directly through the shared memory.
                Supports CLI and WorkBench usage.  This is an update 
                to version 2.0 on disk 406.  
                Version 2.1.  Shareware, binary only.

CLImax          A command like NewCLI or NewShell except that it creates a
                borderless CLI or Shell window on a custom screen.  Now you
                can use the whole display just like a non-windowing computer.
                Requires ConMan 1.3 or newer.  Release three, vastly improved
                over the first release on disk 224.  Includes source. 
                Author:  Paul Kienitz.

Dr              Another alternative CLI directory lister command.  This one
                features extreme optimization for speed, a variety of output
                formats, hiding of .info files by default, and AmigaDOS
                pattern matching.  It is pure (residentable).  It is intended
                to outperform all other directory listers.  Includes the
                additional utilities ForEvery and Whichever. 
                Version 1.2, includes source.
                Author:  Paul Kienitz.

FixCLI          A tiny pure command which fixes problems with CLI's not
                created by other CLI processes.  A new CLI or Shell created
                by such programs as PopCLI or DMouse gets no path and no
                current directory.  FixCLI very quickly and efficiently gives
                a path to a CLI that does not have one (it looks for other
                processes that have valid paths) and sets the current
                directory as specified if none is already set.  Put it in
                your S:Shell-Startup script.  Includes source.

MoveSYS         Reassigns SYS:, C:, S:, L:, LIBS:, DEVS:, and FONTS: to a new
                disk or directory in one step.  Can be used from CLI or
                Workbench; just click it and shift-double-click a disk or
                drawer icon.  More flexible and robust than some other
                programs written for the same purpose.  It's small and pure. 
                Second release (the one on disk 224 worked from CLI only).
                Includes source.

RunBack         A very compact version of the popular utility for starting a
                CLI process in the background, without preventing the CLI
                window from closing.  This version is pure and only 468 bytes
                long.  Requires the NULL: device, which is included.  Using
                NULL: makes it more flexible and robust than older RunBacks. 
                Can optionally delay up to nine seconds after starting the
                command.  Includes source in assembly.

Uedit-Stuff     A variety of configuration material for Uedit.  Includes

                interfacing through Rexx with a terminal program, displaying
                matching '(' characters when you press ')', expanding
                abbreviations into phrases as you type, easily shifting lines

                A front-end for Commodore's More or some other text viewer
                that can be made resident.  Can be used from Workbench,
                greatly reducing disk loading time because V is much smaller
                than More, which need not be loaded if it is resident.  From
                CLI, causes More to create a new window, specified with an
                environment variable, rather than using the CLI window.  V is
                itself residentable.  Much improved since the version on
                disk 224, to which it is only distantly related.  Includes
                source in assembly.

APalAsm         A Programmable Array Logic (PAL) program based on an old
                MMI Fortran IV program from the 'PAL Handbook' Second
                Edition and Third Edition by MMI.  This Version (1.00) is
                completely rewritten for Fortran 77.  The outputs produced
                are sent to separate files instead of the screen.  There
                are plenty of example PAL files to test, inspect, or just
                to learn what PAL's are all about.  The Fortran source is
                included with the instructions to compile using AC/Fortran
                version 2.3.

Conquest        Lore of Conquest is a war game similar in concept to the
                board game Risk.  You are the lord of an entire world,
                destined to rule the galaxy.  Some worlds are virgin fruits,
                ready for you to colonize.  Some worlds have natives who do
                not wish to accept your rule, these you must conquer for
                they will yield more valuable resources.  As you claim the
                galaxy you will find, you are not the only one extending
                your dominion.  This is a two-player game, so be prepared
                to defend yourself and take what is yours!

FifoDev         FIFO: is like PIPE: but is based on fifo.library rather
                than its own implementation.  Fifo.library is a general
                fifo library implementation that supports named fifos,
                writing to a fifo from a hardware exception, multiple
                readers on a fifo with each getting the same data stream,
                efficient reading, and automatic or manual flow control.
                Programs that require non-blocking IO can access one side
                of a FIFO: connection via the fifo.library instead of the
                FIFO: device.  Includes some source.

Reader          A program to scan a word list to locate which words can
                be made from the letters given.  Allows matching of words
                by length and by giving the letters known, ie. m.t.h for
                the word MATCH.  Great for word games and crosswords.
                Results output to screen and a RAM: based file.  The word
                list is in ascii and so can be edited if desired.  New
                words can be added and it could be used for different
                languages if required.  Supplied with over 24,200 words

Gwin            GWIN or Graphics WINdow is an integrated collection of
                graphics routines callable from C.  These routines make it
                easy to create sophisticated graphics programs in the C
                environment.  One line calls give you a custom screen (ten
                types available), menu items, requestors, text, circles,
                polygons, etc.  GWIN is a two dimensional floating point
                graphics system with conversion between world and screen
                coordinates.  GWIN includes built in clipping that may be
                turned off for speed.  Use of color and XOR operations are
                greatly simplified.  Many examples of the use of GWIN are
                included in an examples directory, including a line/bar graph
                program, geographic mapping program, SPICE 2G.6 graphics post
