                for additional serial ports, external file transfer protocols
                (XPR), a "chat" mode, and scrollback/review/history buffer.
                It comes in two versions, one with Tektronix emulation, and
                one without.  The Tektronix emulation allows saving IFF files,
                PostScript files, and printing bitmaps to the printer.  This
                is an update to version 4.226 on disk 257.
                The major change for this update is a rewrite of the
                Tektronix emulation to support almost all of the Tektronix
                4105 escape sequences.  
                Version 4.428.  Binary only.

AmiOmega        Amiga port of the Omega game.  Omega is similar to hack
                or rogue, but is much more complex.  There is a city,
                several towns, a wilderness, lots of dungeons, a multitude
                of monsters, lots of spells, magic items, etc.  There are
                several quests to complete.  All in all, it is an excellent
                game.  Requires 1Mb or more of memory.

IconJ           IconJ significantly enhances the IconX program, and is
                100% compatible.  It allows scripts to be executed by
                double-clicking the script's icon.  Abilities include
                joining the script with the icon file itself, or calling
                it from any directory or disk, executing either AmigaDOS
                or ARexx scripts, outputing to any file or device, running
                interactive scripts and scripts that contain conditionals,
                and creating relative console windows.  Includes a utility
                called AtatJ which attaches or detaches a script to/from
                an icon file.

                file.  Some features are case independent search, wildcards,
                interactive mode (cd implemented), can display size and date
                of files, always abortable, can archive filenames for "ZOO"
                (like fnams/recurdir), and no recursive procedures. Includes

Gwin            Version 1.0 of GWIN.  GWIN or Graphics WINdow is
                an integrated collection of graphics routines callable
                from C.  These routines make it easy to create sophisticated
                graphics programs in the C environment.  One-line calls give
                you a custom screen (ten types available), menu items,
                requestors, text, circles, polygons, etc.  GWIN is a
                two-dimensional floating point graphics system with
                conversion between world and screen coordinates.  GWIN
                includes built-in clipping that may be turned off for
                speed.  Use of color and XOR operations are greatly
                simplified.  Many examples of the use of GWIN are
                included in an examples directory.  Examples include
                line/bar graph program, geographic mapping program,
                SPICE 2G.6 graphics post-processor, and others.  Extensive
                documentation is included.

MemGuard        MemGuard is a MemWatch-like program which has been rewritten
                assembly language for maximum speed and efficiency. Unlike
                MemWatch MemGuard does not run as Task in a dummy loop but 
                rather as a low-level interrupt routine which is capable of
                trapping memory thrashing even before exec might know of it
                and even while task switching is forbidden. In fact the low
                memory area is checked each frame. Virtually no processing
                time is wasted, the interrupt routine does the check in about
                half a raster scan line's time.  This program was contributed
                by Ralf Thanner, who spent three weeks programming & debugging
                it.  In this program Ralf uses some very delicate tricks to
                let his interrupt routine work with Intuition alerts.

                implemented is sets.  This is an update to version 1.0 on 
                disk 183.  It is much enhanced and about four times faster.
                Includes the compiler source and example programs.
                Version 1.1c.

P2C             P2C is a tool for translating Pascal programs into C.
                It handles the following Pascal dialects: HP Pascal,
                Turbo/UCSD Pascal, DEC VAX Pascal, Oregon Software
                Pascal/2, Macintosh Programmer's Workshop Pascal,
                Sun/Berkeley Pascal.  Modula-2 syntax is also supported.
                Most reasonable Pascal programs are converted into fully
                functional C which will compile and run with no further
                modifications.

CRobots         A game based on computer programming.  Unlike arcade type
                games which require human input controlling some object,
                all strategy in CRobots is condensed into a C language
                program that you design and write, to control a robot
                whose mission is to seek out, track, and destroy other
                robots, each running different programs.  All robots are
                equally equipped, and up to four may compete at once.

GetImage        An enhanced version of "gi" from disk 14.  It now looks
                for the GRAB marker, in the brush file, instead of assuming
                that it is at a specific place, sets up the PlanePick
                value in the Image structure, and deletes any unused
                bitplanes to save memory and disk space.  Includes source.

                1987, p 631.  A sine rose is a graph of the polar equation

                variety of `sed' and `cat' shar formats, and handling large
                files spread across several shar files.  This is an update

X2X             Cross converts between Motorola/Intel/Tektronix ASCII-hex

                chaos.  Handles S1, S2, S3, INTEL (inc USBA records),
                Tektronix (inc extended).  Source included.
