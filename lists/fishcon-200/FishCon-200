NotBoingAgain   This is Dr. Gandalf's entry for the First Annual Badge
                Killer Demo Contest.  It is an interlaced HAM animation
                with nicely integrated sound effects. It is a great visual
                pun on the original Boing demo, but to say anymore would
                ruin the effect.  Binary only, requires 1 Mb of memory.

PrtSpool        A DOS handler, a print program, and a control program
                that implement a print spooling system.  Like PRT:, the

                printed.  The print program does line numbering and
                page headers.  The control program handles administrative

Vlt             VLT is both a VT100 emulator and a Tektronix (4014 plus
                subset of 4105) emulator, currently in use at SLAC
                (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center).  Although the VT100
                part was originally based on Dave Wecker et al.'s VT100,
                many enhancements were made. The program requires ARP, and
                it has an ARexx port.  XMODEM 1K/CRC and Kermit protocol
                support also included.  This is version 4.036, with many
                enhancements over the previous version, 3.656, included
                on disk 202.  New features include support for other serial
                ports, external file transfer protocols, and "chat" mode.
                Improved behavior on the Workbench.  Tektronix emulation
                now allows saving IFF files, PostScript files, and
                printing bitmaps to the printer.  Many other enhancements
                and bug fixes.  Binary only.

Brik            A general purpose program that calculates both text and
                binary cyclic redundancy codes (CRCs).  Text mode CRCs
                calculated by brik are portable across systems for files
                that are in the usual text format on each system.  Binary
                mode CRCs are portable for files that are moved from
                system to system without any change.  Brik can be used
                to verify and update an embedded checksum header in files.
                It runs under MS-DOS, UNIX system V, BSD UNIX, VAX/VMS,
                and AmigaDOS.

                It's also an example of how an accessory program can

                to read all kinds of MMU registers and figure it out for

Speed           A performance benchmark useful for comparing Amiga
                processing speeds.  Performs 10000 iterations of some

                not at all, notification of overrunning or underrunning
                allocated memory, generation of low memory conditions
                for testing purposes, and identification of violations

FragIt          A dynamic memory thrasher for the Amiga.  FragIt randomly
                allocates and deallocates psuedo-random size values of
                memory, ranging from 16 bytes to 50000 bytes by default.
                The result is an allocation nightmare, thousands of memory
                fragments are being created and destroyed continuously.
                This puts stress on the memory allocation routines of an
                application undergoing testing by simulating a very busy,
                highly fragmented memory environment. This is version 2.0,
                featuring many bug fixes, a full intuition interface,
                configuration settings via the icon, and more.
                Version 2.0, includes source.

Size            Size checker uses a list of possible sizes of a file to
                check for unexpected changes in the size of those files.
                For example, it can be used to spot a link virus or to
                point out changes in the configuration of your system.
                With the appropriate comments added to your size list,
                you can check to see what version of the files you are

ScreenShare     A library and support programs that enable applications

                routines containing buffered C-like file handling
                functions (fopen, fclose, fgets, fputs, etc) and a file
