  AMIGA NOSTALGIA

  This archive contains some files from way back in 1988,
listing the software titles, hardware, books and magazines
available in the early days of the Amiga, from Sept. 1985
through to January 1988.

  The files 'a.one' to 'a.four' are the original files I made
using EasyScript on a Commodore 64, which could only handle
one file of four A4 pages in length, due to its 48k memory.

    a.one   September 1985 to February 1987.
    a.two   March to August 1987.
    a.three August to November 1987.
    a.four  December 1987 to January 1988.

  The files ASoftware.* is a SuperBase database of the
software only. Hardware.* is the hardware!

  Most of this stuff actually appeared, although a few things
were announced but never materialized. Obviously all of the
addresses given no longer apply.

  Enjoy!

  John V. Keogh, London, 21 July 1998.
