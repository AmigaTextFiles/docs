                      The Amiga PD Developers Directory
                            RELEASE 1.c   19/1/96


This is not a new idea but it has never been done properly before. 
The PD Developers Directory is COMPLETELY FREE OF CHARGE for the 
participants AND the recipients. The aim of the list is to give anyone 
access to help for their software projects, though it could also be used to 
source help on other things we computer dudes tend to do. 
Once a reasonable amount of names are on the list the self appointed 
moderator 'F1 Licenceware' will spread the file to the public domain via 
the Aminet/PD libraries/BBS's and hopefully with the help of Amiga Shopper.

The difference with this list is that it is a serious attempt to help
Amiga developers, and no direct profit is involved. In fact NO MONEY is
involved at all, unlike previous efforts seen before. that's why they
failed. So why is F1 Licenceware wasting valuable time on this project?
The answer is that F1 will benefit from the list itself as a source of new 
programmers for future F1 titles and that is it. 

So if you have a skill: artist, musician, coder, writer, playtester, 
or you want to get a coding group together or you just need a decnt graphic
artist to touch up that blockbuster game why not see what people have to 
offer you?  You have nothing to lose.

We can also accept 'Wanted' entries for the list so if you are looking for a
decent graphic artist or what have you complete the 'wanted' entry form and
send it in e-mail or snail mail.
  
 
I must point out here that NOBODY goes on the list without their knowledge.
In other words we are not going to copy a load of names from PD doc files.
