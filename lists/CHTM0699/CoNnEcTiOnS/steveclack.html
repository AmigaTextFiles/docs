    <u>FluffyNET Mail Network - By Steve Clack (SysOp Of Total Eclipse BBS)</u>

A Mail Network is simply a collection of Bulletin Boards that call each
other and transfer Messages usually in the middle of the night while most
people are blissfully unaware and snoozing in bed.  Most people?  Well...
some people anyway.  If you've ever tried to call a BBS and got the message
&quot;Sorry, this BBS only accepts Mail Calls at this time!&quot;, it probably means
you're up bloody late and you should be asleep!!!

You've no doubt sent a message to the SysOp of a BBS before, so you know
it's easy to write a message.  Well, it's just as easy to send a message to
the Users of many Bulletin Boards by writing the message on a Mail Network
- if you write a Message to &quot;All&quot;, it's quite possible that everyone can
see it on every Bulletin Board in the Mail Network.

One of the most popular Mail Networks is FidoNET, and this is what Network
Mail was invented for.  It started off in the US, thousands of years ago,
and only consisted of a few Bulletin Boards, but these days it consists of
thousands of Bulletin Boards across international borders - a bit like the
Internet. 

FluffyNET was originally created by Roger Wilco and Niki Murkett, it evolved
from a (now dead) Network called HappyNET.  FluffyNET is so-called because
of Sheep, but don't let that put you off, that's Niki's mind.  Since its
humble beginnings it has grown exponentially, and has recovered from a few
setbacks...these being various disputes (well, full blown arguments) and
Hubs (Bulletin Boards that all the Mail eventually goes back to and back
out from again) closing, infact the main FluffyNET Hub has changed 3 times
and is now in the hands of me at <a href="totaleclipsebbs.html">Total Eclipse BBS</a>.

The disputes have mostly been settled but that doesn't mean it's not
lively!  It is growing again after several Bulletin Boards simultaniously
quit, they had the impression they could run a Bulletin Board on a Windows
based PC!!!

Glen Martin (SysOp Of Gremlins BBS) is responsible for keeping all the
Nodelists and information packs up to date, even though his BBS has gone
Private now (no idea why), and he regularly sends updates to the AMINET
which of course also arrive on FluffyNET Bulletin Boards.  Just look out
for archives under the names of &quot;FluffyNet.lha&quot; and &quot;Fluffy_Guide.lha&quot; if
you want some more information (on joining or the people on the Network).

Well...here is the current state of affairs, also known as a &quot;Nodelist&quot;...

FluffyNET is also available in Australia, Croatia, Norway and Sweden.  If
you want to use FluffyNET, just call one of the Bulletin Boards listed in
the Nodelist and go into their Message section.  If you want to join the
Mail Network however, then you should call <a href="totaleclipsebbs.html">Total Eclipse BBS</a> for more
information.  Please note that the number stated for <a href="totaleclipsebbs.html">Total Eclipse BBS</a> is
not a Premium Rate number, it is charged at standard National Rates.  If
you are a Local/Regional Call to the Isle of Wight, you call 01983-522428
instead to save you money.
