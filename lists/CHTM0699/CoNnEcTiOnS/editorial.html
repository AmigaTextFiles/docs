Welcome to another *NEW-LOOK* <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">.  WOW...what an Issue this is!!!
The Largest Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> to date, thanks to a flood of Submissions
from YOU the Readers.  It seems as though we have got people's attention,
that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> isn't going to be another one of those BBS Lists that gets
updated for a couple of months, before disappearing into obscurity.  Now
into Issue 4, <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is here to stay!!!  As long as there's a UK BBS
Scene, <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> will be here to support it!!!

The UK BBS Scene is looking a little more healthier than it was a few
months ago, with many new BBSes opening around the UK, far out-weighing
those that are closing down.  It is these new BBSes that we would like to
draw your attention to.  Please support these new BBSes, the UK BBS Scene
is in bad need of new SysOps that can add their own unique contribution
to the UK BBS Scene, and get the UK BBS Scene thriving once again.  Without
these fledgling SysOps, and their enthusiasm towards the UK BBS Scene, the
current UK BBS Scene would deteriate even more than it has done in the last
few years.  <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> has heard from two fledgling SysOps who have spent
a lot of time and money, building their new BBSes, only to get a handful
of Callers in return for their efforts.  <a href="burnleybbs.html">Burnley BBS</a> and USS Defiant BBS
both need your support, if they are to avoid joining the ever-increasing
list of BBS Closures.

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> would like to thank AMIGA FORMAT Magazine for their invaluable
help in keeping the UK BBS Scene alive, by allowing BBSes to advertise
freely in their Readers Adverts section.  By allowing BBSes to advertise to
a potential 14,000+ audience, AMIGA FORMAT has introduced new BBS Users to
the UK BBS Scene, people who thought that the Internet was the only place
available for AMIGA support.  Although we know of many BBSes whose Calls
and Users have increased as a result of being advertised in AMIGA FORMAT
and <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, we would still like to hear from SysOps who have actually
benefitted from advertising through either or both of these two mediums.

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> will be delivering a Special-Edition of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> to AMIGA
FORMAT, exclusive to AMIGA FORMAT, as a mark of appreciation for their
efforts in helping to maintain the UK BBS Scene.  This Special-Edition
will be completed before the Next Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, and will probably
appear on the August Issue of AMIGA FORMAT, which will be on sale at their
stand at the World Of Amiga Show 1999 at Kensington, London on July 24th
and 25th.  <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> will hopefully be attending the event on July 24th,
sporting the *NEW* <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> T-Shirt.  Further details will follow in
the Next Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">!!!

See you Next Issue...
