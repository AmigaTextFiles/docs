       <u>First Impressions - By Geoff Hogarth (SysOp Of Ultracomm BBS)</u>

Well first impressions of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> are very good, an up-to-date database
of all known BBSes is just what SysOps and BBS Users need.

I hope that the Authors of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> can succeed where others have
failed, but to do that means a lot of time researching and a lot of Calls
verifying BBSes.  Therefore much help is needed from SysOps and BBS Users
alike, to pass on information on BBSes operating that are not on the BBS
List, and of course any BBSes that are offline.

The Internet has definately done damage to the Dial-Up BBS scene, but having
said that, the Internet BBS Scene appears to be thriving.  Of course, the
main reason people call the Internet BBS as opposed to a Dial-Up BBS at the
other end of the country, is the cost of the Call, so a good up-to-date BBS
List, like <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, is invaluable if the Dial-Up BBS is to thrive again.

Well done!!!
