&quot;Love <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, it's very comprehensive and very professional.  How
about creating a <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> PC Executable rather than just the Text-File
PC Version?&quot;

<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is constructed entirely on an AMIGA A1200-030 using CygnusED
Professional, and therefore the problem of making a PC Executable of
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> arises, as <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> does not have access to a PC, and
indeed if we had, we probably wouldn't know where to start in making a PC
Executable!!!  If there are PC Users out there, who read <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, then
we openly invite anyone to create a PC Executable, as long as they confirm
the project with <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> first, as <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> IS copyrighted!!!
We are currently looking into the possibility of releasing <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> in
HTML Format, which would mean that <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> could be read on any System
with an Internet Web-Browser.  This is as close as <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> can get at
this moment in time to a PC Executable.

&quot;Regarding the proposed <font color="#ffffff">GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, the International BBS List, I
personally think that this is a waste of time for the average BBS User, due
to the Call Costs involved.  So come on Dunkie and Pete, and put all your
efforts into continuing <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">!!!

The <font color="#ffffff">GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> project has been shelved indefinetly, due to lack
of interest, probably as a result of the reason you mention above.  In the
meantime, as you suggest, we will be putting all our efforts into bringing
you <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> every month.

&quot;After seeing the New-Look <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, I just thought I would say that
<font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> is getting bigger and better with each Issue.  Keep up the
good work!!!&quot;

We at <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> are always looking at ways to improve <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, and
the New-Look was only made possible thanks to your invaluable help, in
providing us with a complete set of AmigaGuide Commands last month.  This
Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000">, will certainly not disappoint you, it is by far the
BIGGEST and BEST Issue of <font color="#ffffff">CoNnEcTiOnS<font color="#000000"> to date!!!  Happy reading!!!
