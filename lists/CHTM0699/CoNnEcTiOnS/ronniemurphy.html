            <u>Have You Hugged Your SysOp Today? - By Ronnie Murphy</u>

What's the Upload thing for?  Yeah...well it seems a lot of people just
aren't getting the point of a BBS.  It is there for those of us who want to
share things like Files, Games and HD Installers.  But sharing means share
and share alike.  On most of the Bulletin Boards I have been on, the &quot;U&quot;
for Upload flag in the Caller Log is becoming a more and more rare sight.

Quite a few Bulletin Boards no longer use the old ratios which were a
constant bugger for leachers amongst us (and I'm including myself here).
Now we have the advent of no ratios and people now just leave it up to the
SysOp to add Files!!!

I know that it is getting more and more difficult to get AMIGA stuff
nowadays, but try checking out the &quot;All Files Linked&quot; Door and see if there
isn't something there that you have.  Is it Shareware/Freeware?  Will it be
interesting to others?  Yeah?  Well what are you waiting for?  Hit that &quot;U&quot;
Button now!!!

It is up to every member of a Bulletin Board to keep that Bulletin Board
running, even drop by and have a chat with the SysOp, after all it is his
Bulletin Board you are on!!!

As one Bulletin Board puts it: &quot;HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR SYSOP TODAY?&quot;  Well...
HAVE YOU?
