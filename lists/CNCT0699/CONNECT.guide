                          @{b}@{u}I N T R O D U C T I O N@{ub}@{uu}

Welcome to the Fourth Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is a Monthly
UK BBS Scene Magazine containing a comprehensive UK BBS Directory.

Many SysOps have tried their hands at generating up-to-date BBS Lists, but
most have found them too difficult to maintain and have abandoned updating
them, with the exception of the odd few, like Turbo D at @{BG fill}@{"Alpha Zone BBS" Link AlphaZoneBBS}@{BG background}
who has for the last 7 months supplied a list of BBS Numbers to the AMINET.

However, most BBS Lists contain BBS Numbers of BBSes that have long since
left the scene, and of all the Lists we have encountered, there hasn't
been one that has been accurately up-to-date.

At the time of going to press, ALL the BBSes listed in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} have
been 100% verified as being online.  We have spent the last 5 months
ringing BBS Numbers to find out which BBSes are still online, and to find
out those that have left the scene.  We have still a lot of work to do,
but I'm sure you can appreciate the cost of dialling every BBS Number we
have found in the afore mentioned BBS Lists, and that is why we need YOUR
help in providing us with information of any BBSes you know that are still
online, that are not listed in this issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

Furthermore, we need YOUR help in keeping @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} up-to-date with BBS
Closures, New Numbers, Relaunches, Renames etc.  For more details on how
to contact us, access @{BG fill}@{"Submissions" Link Submissions}@{BG background}.

The BBS Scene is in bad need of positive publicity...and we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
strongly believe that BBS Advertising is a damn good start.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
aims to provide the AMIGA Community with a central resource of information
regarding the current status of the UK BBS Scene, with the added bonus of a
comprehensive UK BBS Directory every month.

When we first researched for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to find out just how many BBSes
were still up and running, we were pleasantly suprised by the number we
found were still online, and those 124 BBSes we found, were entered into
the First Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  That 124 BBSes has now grown to 191 BBSes
for the Fourth Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, just proving that the UK BBS Scene is
far from dead, as was first thought. 

From our point of view, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has really made a difference to the
number of Calls and New Users at our respective BBSes, and many of our New
Users had never been on a BBS before in their lives, the Internet, yes, but
never a BBS, as they thought that BBSes were extinct.  Feedback from other
SysOps who advertised in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} suggests that they have experienced the
same result, which proves a point, that SysOps should not just sit back and
accept the number of Users in their User-Base, but should advertise their
BBSes as much as possible, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} giving them that very chance.

AMIGA FORMAT Magazine recently started a column for BBS Numbers in their
Readers Adverts section, and those that have advertised, including
ourselves, have found that advertising DOES work, and that there ARE
members of the AMIGA Community who want to call BBSes, but never knew
where to get in contact with them!  Therefore in respect of all you SysOps
that think that advertising is a waste of time...we rest our case!!!

The Internet has done much damage to the UK BBS Scene, especially when Free
ISPs were launched, but that damage is not irrepairable, as we have proven,
and ironically @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has used the Internet to get to it's prospective
audience, to get Internet Users back to the UK BBS Scene, and it appears to
have worked, and worked well.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been well received from SysOps and BBS Users alike, and the
Correspondence we have received from Readers has been tremendous.  We
honestly didn't believe that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would be so popular, and its
thanks to your input and feedback that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has established itself
as the leading UK BBS Scene Magazine after only it's Third Issue!!!

Plans to take @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}' coverage beyond the United Kingdom are already
under consideration.  Work on @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has already started, but
we foresee a problem that really needs to be addressed before we continue
any further with the project.  Basically, does the UK BBS Scene really want
an International BBS Directory?  If the answer to this questions is "Yes",
then how do we market it?  Do we release it seperately, to give YOU the
choice whether you want to Download it or not, or do we include it within
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, bearing in mind the Archive Size will probably double?

Please help us to make this decision, get in touch with us at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text},
and let us know what YOU want.  If we get no response from YOU, as Readers
of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then the @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} project will be scrapped!!!

Please keep the Correspondence coming, we would especially like to hear from
SysOps who have advertised their BBSes in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and have benefitted
as a result.  Also, if any of you have any ideas on how we can improve the
content of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, or if you have anything at all to contribute to
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then please get in touch, even if you only have a sentence or
two to say, ALL Correspondence will be read and replied to, and may even
get included in the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!

See you Next Issue...

Due to the Microsoft Network altering it's Hotmail Web-Based E-Mail Service
to support their latest Internet Explorer Software, it has become almost
impossible for us to collect E-Mail from "www.hotmail.com", as the current
AMIGA Web-Browsers do not support JavaScript.  As a result of this we have

Welcome to another *NEW-LOOK* @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  WOW...what an Issue this is!!!
The Largest Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to date, thanks to a flood of Submissions
from YOU the Readers.  It seems as though we have got people's attention,
that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} isn't going to be another one of those BBS Lists that gets
updated for a couple of months, before disappearing into obscurity.  Now
into Issue 4, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is here to stay!!!  As long as there's a UK BBS
Scene, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} will be here to support it!!!

The UK BBS Scene is looking a little more healthier than it was a few
months ago, with many new BBSes opening around the UK, far out-weighing
those that are closing down.  It is these new BBSes that we would like to
draw your attention to.  Please support these new BBSes, the UK BBS Scene
is in bad need of new SysOps that can add their own unique contribution
to the UK BBS Scene, and get the UK BBS Scene thriving once again.  Without
these fledgling SysOps, and their enthusiasm towards the UK BBS Scene, the
current UK BBS Scene would deteriate even more than it has done in the last
few years.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has heard from two fledgling SysOps who have spent
a lot of time and money, building their new BBSes, only to get a handful
of Callers in return for their efforts.  @{BG fill}@{"Burnley BBS" Link BurnleyBBS}@{BG background} and USS Defiant BBS
both need your support, if they are to avoid joining the ever-increasing
list of BBS Closures.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would like to thank AMIGA FORMAT Magazine for their invaluable
help in keeping the UK BBS Scene alive, by allowing BBSes to advertise
freely in their Readers Adverts section.  By allowing BBSes to advertise to
a potential 14,000+ audience, AMIGA FORMAT has introduced new BBS Users to
the UK BBS Scene, people who thought that the Internet was the only place
available for AMIGA support.  Although we know of many BBSes whose Calls
and Users have increased as a result of being advertised in AMIGA FORMAT
and @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, we would still like to hear from SysOps who have actually
benefitted from advertising through either or both of these two mediums.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} will be delivering a Special-Edition of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to AMIGA
FORMAT, exclusive to AMIGA FORMAT, as a mark of appreciation for their
efforts in helping to maintain the UK BBS Scene.  This Special-Edition
will be completed before the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and will probably
appear on the August Issue of AMIGA FORMAT, which will be on sale at their
stand at the World Of Amiga Show 1999 at Kensington, London on July 24th
and 25th.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} will hopefully be attending the event on July 24th,
sporting the *NEW* @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} T-Shirt.  Further details will follow in
the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!

See you Next Issue...

      @{u}Advertise, Advertise & Advertise A Little More - By Danny Corkin@{uu}

Bulletin Board Systems, what a fascinating thing they are indeed, and this
is coming from a veteran BBS User, who is only 15 years old!!!

So, why do the current batch of regulars in the UK enjoy using these Amateur
Systems so much?  It's quite simple really...a well set-up BBS has a well
arranged File area for Users - AMIGA and PC alike - to Download and Upload
Files at ease using a simple Terminal Program.  A decent BBS must also have
connections in the form of National and International Mail Networks, a few
Online Games, and last - but most definitely not least - a friendly,
dedicated SysOp.

But sadly, the BBS Scene in the UK is deminishing - not the actual amount of
Bulletin Board Systems - but the number of Users.  I have an good example of
this, a great BBS in Lincoln, Most Wanted BBS, closed down about a year ago,
after being around for about 5 years.  It had a great User-Base of nearly
300 Users, and the vast majority of those Users were Locals.  When Most
Wanted BBS closed down, it was the turn of @{BG fill}@{"Skull Monkey BBS" Link SkullMonkeyBBS}@{BG background} to take over
the crown of Lincoln's BBSes, but it seems that hardly any of these former
Most Wanted BBS Users have moved over to @{BG fill}@{"Skull Monkey BBS" Link SkullMonkeyBBS}@{BG background} or the later
appearing Joker's World BBS and The Power House BBS.  Where have these Users
gone?  Surely the Internet, but why can't they come back?  The simple fact
is that now, in Lincoln, the BBS Scene is in a strange state of affairs,
with a new BBS popping up every now and again, but the Users just not being
there.  So, what the BBS Scene needs to prosper once again in my opinion, is
a good Local User-Base.

So I send a message out to all SysOps who genuinely want to bring in
Callers: Advertise, Advertise, and Advertise a little more.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
Magazine is an excellent start to this, but in my opinion BBS Advertising
MUST go Local, perhaps more importantly than Nationally.

Come on SysOps, for many of you BBSes are your pride and joy, so make all
that effort it took you installing all those Doors become worthwile, and
Advertise in your Local Newspaper, a Regional publication - such as Diamond
Free-Ads, and this very National Electronic publication, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  Think
for a minute of all that work you put into your BBS, and how many Users you
could do with.  Advertise your BBS in as many places as humanly possible!!!

Regards

Danny Corkin "Zeus" (Co-SysOp Of The Power House BBS)

       @{u}First Impressions - By Geoff Hogarth (SysOp Of Ultracomm BBS)@{uu}

Well first impressions of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} are very good, an up-to-date database
of all known BBSes is just what SysOps and BBS Users need.

I hope that the Authors of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} can succeed where others have
failed, but to do that means a lot of time researching and a lot of Calls
verifying BBSes.  Therefore much help is needed from SysOps and BBS Users
alike, to pass on information on BBSes operating that are not on the BBS
List, and of course any BBSes that are offline.

The Internet has definately done damage to the Dial-Up BBS scene, but having
said that, the Internet BBS Scene appears to be thriving.  Of course, the
main reason people call the Internet BBS as opposed to a Dial-Up BBS at the
other end of the country, is the cost of the Call, so a good up-to-date BBS
List, like @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, is invaluable if the Dial-Up BBS is to thrive again.

Well done!!!

    @{u}FluffyNET Mail Network - By Steve Clack (SysOp Of Total Eclipse BBS)@{uu}

A Mail Network is simply a collection of Bulletin Boards that call each
other and transfer Messages usually in the middle of the night while most
people are blissfully unaware and snoozing in bed.  Most people?  Well...
some people anyway.  If you've ever tried to call a BBS and got the message
"Sorry, this BBS only accepts Mail Calls at this time!", it probably means
you're up bloody late and you should be asleep!!!

You've no doubt sent a message to the SysOp of a BBS before, so you know
it's easy to write a message.  Well, it's just as easy to send a message to
the Users of many Bulletin Boards by writing the message on a Mail Network
- if you write a Message to "All", it's quite possible that everyone can
see it on every Bulletin Board in the Mail Network.

One of the most popular Mail Networks is FidoNET, and this is what Network
Mail was invented for.  It started off in the US, thousands of years ago,
and only consisted of a few Bulletin Boards, but these days it consists of
thousands of Bulletin Boards across international borders - a bit like the
Internet. 

FluffyNET was originally created by Roger Wilco and Niki Murkett, it evolved
from a (now dead) Network called HappyNET.  FluffyNET is so-called because
of Sheep, but don't let that put you off, that's Niki's mind.  Since its
humble beginnings it has grown exponentially, and has recovered from a few
setbacks...these being various disputes (well, full blown arguments) and
Hubs (Bulletin Boards that all the Mail eventually goes back to and back
out from again) closing, infact the main FluffyNET Hub has changed 3 times
and is now in the hands of me at @{BG fill}@{"Total Eclipse BBS" Link TotalEclipseBBS}@{BG background}.

The disputes have mostly been settled but that doesn't mean it's not
lively!  It is growing again after several Bulletin Boards simultaniously
quit, they had the impression they could run a Bulletin Board on a Windows
based PC!!!

Glen Martin (SysOp Of Gremlins BBS) is responsible for keeping all the
Nodelists and information packs up to date, even though his BBS has gone
Private now (no idea why), and he regularly sends updates to the AMINET
which of course also arrive on FluffyNET Bulletin Boards.  Just look out
for archives under the names of "FluffyNet.lha" and "Fluffy_Guide.lha" if
you want some more information (on joining or the people on the Network).

Well...here is the current state of affairs, also known as a "Nodelist"...

            @{u}Have You Hugged Your SysOp Today? - By Ronnie Murphy@{uu}

What's the Upload thing for?  Yeah...well it seems a lot of people just
aren't getting the point of a BBS.  It is there for those of us who want to
share things like Files, Games and HD Installers.  But sharing means share
and share alike.  On most of the Bulletin Boards I have been on, the "U"
for Upload flag in the Caller Log is becoming a more and more rare sight.

Quite a few Bulletin Boards no longer use the old ratios which were a
constant bugger for leachers amongst us (and I'm including myself here).
Now we have the advent of no ratios and people now just leave it up to the
SysOp to add Files!!!

I know that it is getting more and more difficult to get AMIGA stuff
nowadays, but try checking out the "All Files Linked" Door and see if there
isn't something there that you have.  Is it Shareware/Freeware?  Will it be
interesting to others?  Yeah?  Well what are you waiting for?  Hit that "U"
Button now!!!

It is up to every member of a Bulletin Board to keep that Bulletin Board
running, even drop by and have a chat with the SysOp, after all it is his
Bulletin Board you are on!!!

As one Bulletin Board puts it: "HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR SYSOP TODAY?"  Well...
HAVE YOU?

"Love @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, it's very comprehensive and very professional.  How
about creating a @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} PC Executable rather than just the Text-File
PC Version?"

Ian Jones "Intruder" (Barnsley, South Yorkshire)

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is constructed entirely on an AMIGA A1200-030 using CygnusED
Professional, and therefore the problem of making a PC Executable of
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} arises, as @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} does not have access to a PC, and
indeed if we had, we probably wouldn't know where to start in making a PC
Executable!!!  If there are PC Users out there, who read @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then
we openly invite anyone to create a PC Executable, as long as they confirm
the project with @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} first, as @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} IS copyrighted!!!
We are currently looking into the possibility of releasing @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} in
HTML Format, which would mean that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} could be read on any System
with an Internet Web-Browser.  This is as close as @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} can get at
this moment in time to a PC Executable.

"Regarding the proposed @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, the International BBS List, I
personally think that this is a waste of time for the average BBS User, due
to the Call Costs involved.  So come on Dunkie and Pete, and put all your
efforts into continuing @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

The @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} project has been shelved indefinetly, due to lack
of interest, probably as a result of the reason you mention above.  In the
meantime, as you suggest, we will be putting all our efforts into bringing
you @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} every month.
                                    ____

"After seeing the New-Look @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, I just thought I would say that
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is getting bigger and better with each Issue.  Keep up the
good work!!!"

We at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} are always looking at ways to improve @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and
the New-Look was only made possible thanks to your invaluable help, in
providing us with a complete set of AmigaGuide Commands last month.  This
Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, will certainly not disappoint you, it is by far the
BIGGEST and BEST Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to date!!!  Happy reading!!!

 Very generous BBS...You have 255 minutes of online time per day/per call
 and you can download 100 files before having to upload anything...

       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       | The CIRCLE BBS online times and calling information:       |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       | Monday -> Thursday : 00:00 -> 07:00 hrs  : NORMAL DIALLING |
       |                                                            |
       | ALL OTHER TIMES    : The BBS uses RINGBACK (see below).    |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+

       (Normal dialling means:- just call as you would any other BBS)

 USING THE CIRCLE BBS RINGBACK:

 Call the BBS and let the phone ring once, immediately HANG UP.
 Wait 15-20 seconds for the BBS to be loaded.
 Call the BBS again and you'll be connected.
 Please don't just call it as normal - I'll think it's a voice call
 and you'll hear "Hello?" through your modem speaker! ;)

 *FILES*

 14 Online CDs, basically the last 14 Aminets.  Frost Free also regularly
 downloads the latest Aminet files direct to disk for BBS download and Freq.

 *FREQS*

 All files on the BBS and CDs are available for Freq.

 Freq FILES for the Disk based Filelist or AMINET<Number> for the CD File
 Lists, e.g AMINET23

 *MAIL*

 Fidonet - Amiganet - Landnet - Vibeznet - Studentnet - Fluffynet.

 Any echo, no matter how obscure is available.  Mail can be read online or
 via Fido Software.

 Point applications are welcome from old and new.

 E-Mail addresses are available to BBS Users and Fido Users.

 Mail is available via Email to Nodes and Points.

 There is also an IRC channel #FrostFree where points, users and whoever
 else meet up on a nightly basis.  It gets a bit wacky so be warned :)

 *GAMES*

 If you really are a complete anorak, you can play ANSI BBS games.  Enjoy
 yourself and make BT richer while the rest of us go to Dixons and buy a
 PlayStation for 99 quid.

 *EPILOGUE*

 Frost Free is a BBS, it has Files on CD, it has important files not on CD,
 it also carries mail and the SysOp will look after you.

 Thank you.

 Dave Naylor (The SysOp of Frost Free) (Honest)
