                single file for transmission as a unit, or otherwise
                handling as a single file.  "Portable" because the code
                itself is portable and because the archive format is
                very simple (uses ascii headers to separate files).

gothic          Gothic banner printer.  Prints DOWN the page, rather
                than across, so arbitrarily long banners can be 
                created.  Send EOF (CTRL-\) to end input.
                From a Decus C distribution several years ago.

xlisp           A nice little lisp implementation.  Compiles and links
                ok, but something in the Lattice C setjmp/longjmp code
                prevents it from currently running.  Might be easily fixed.

bison           A replacement for unix "yacc" command.  This is from
                the GNU (GNU is Not Unix) effort, and was obtained
                from the Free Software Foundation.  Compiles and
                links (with some effort) but currently crashes the

kermit          This is an absolutely ancient kermit, who's only
                saving grace is that it is small and quite portable.
                On the AMIGA, there is no connect mode, only send and
                receive.  You must log into the remote machine via
                one of it's local terminals and point it's kermit at the
                appropriate serial line connected to the AMIGA.

                generated/other-devices-mouse-simulations) into the
                input stream.  Handler.interface.asm is needed to convert
                the calling sequence performed by the input.task for
                the input stream management into something that a
                C program can understand.

                the fonts that are available, then opens a window and
                then prints a description of the various attributes that
                can be applied to the fonts, in the font itself.
                Previous versions were released as "whichfont".

compress        Compress reduces the size of the named files using
                adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding.  The amount of compression
                obtained depends on the size of the input, the number of
                bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings.
                Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced
                by 50-60%.  Compression is generally much better then that
                achieved by Huffman coding (as used in "pack") or
                adaptive Huffman coding (as used in "compact"), and takes
                less time to compute.  Great for saving disk space, or
                reducing transmission time over phone lines!  Also includes
                "btoa" and "atob" for converting binary files to ascii, and
                then back to binary (for transmission over links that do
                not support 8 bits).
                Author: Thomas Spencer, with improvements by others

dadc            A digital computer impersonating an analog clock
                impersonating a digital clock.
                Author: Perry S. Kivolowitz

microemacs      An upgraded version of microemacs originally distributed
                on disk number 2.  I don't have an exact list of changes
                but the new executable is about 25% larger, so there must
                be something in there!  One enhancement is that some
                functions are now also bound to function keys.
                Author: Dave Conroy, with enhancements by Jack Roose.

PAGE 7  
mult            Mult reads the input comparing adjacent lines.  In the
                normal case, the second and succeeding copies of repeated
                lines are output, and the remainder of the lines are
                removed.  Repeated lines must be adjacent in order to be
                found.  Options are present to output the first of multiple
                lines, for comparing adjacent lines by field only, and for
                specifying the field separator character.  Kind of the
                opposite of the Unix "uniq" program.
                Author: Dennis Bednar

scales          Demonstrates use of the Audio functions in the ROM to
                produce four voice sound.  It uses a simple waveform
                (sawtooth) with no amplitude control (ie, envelope)
                or frequency variation (ie, vibrato), but these can be
                easily implemented.  Also includes considerable 
                documentation on audio device.

sortc           A quicksort based sort program, using separate driver
                and sort modules.  Originally from a DECUS C distribution.
                Claims to be fast, but when operating entirely out of ram
                takes 93 seconds to sort its input file, sort.c, while
                AmigaDos's sort takes only 43 seconds under the same 
                conditions.
                Author: Dave Conroy, Martin Minow, and Ray Van Tassle

stripc          Strips comments and extraneous whitespace from C source
                files.  Useful for compacting the C header files to

had no way of getting in contact with the authors who posted these
programs to various BBS's to request source.  I have no reason to
believe that any of these executable only postings contain any
deliberate "misfeatures", but you should always use such programs
cautiously.

This disk contains two new "strains" of microemacs, both derived from
early releases of Dave Conroy's microemacs.  There is currently an
attempt on usenet, lead by Dave Brower, to coordinate an effort to
merge features from the different versions into a single supported
microemacs.  In the meantime, perhaps you can find a feature you need
in one of these...

Lemacs          Microemacs version 3.6 as enhanced and supported
                by Daniel Lawrence.  This version works and has been
                tested on Unix V7, BSD 4.2, Amiga, MS-DOS, and VMS.
                Enhancements include overwrite mode, support for Amiga
                function keys, reverse video status line, numeric
                arguments using <ESC><number>, replace, buffer specific
                editing modes, word wrap mode, goto-line, buffer rename,

This is disk 23 of the freely distributable AMIGA software library.

This disk contains a significantly enhanced version of microemacs based
on the version 30 release posted to usenet's mod.sources newsgroup.

Previous versions of microemacs released on these disks derived from
a very old version of microemacs.  Since that old release, the author
has cleaned up lots of loose ends and restructured major parts of the code.
Other people have already added support for termcap, ports to other machines
and operating systems, and a limited GNU emacs compatibility option.

Because recipients of this disk might wish to run this new microemacs
on other machines in addition to the Amiga, I have encluded all sources
that were available to me at the time of release.  The subdirectories
which give alternate implementations are:

        Sys/Vms                System modules for VAX VMS
        Sys/Atari        System modules for Atari ST
        Sys/Msdos        System modules for MSDOS
        Sys/Cpm86        System modules for Cpm
        Sys/Amiga        System modules for Amiga
        Sys/Ultrix        System modules for Ultrix/BSD4.2
        Sys/SysV        System modules for Unix System V
        Tty/Atari        Terminal driver for Atari ST
        Tty/7300        Terminal driver for AT&T Unix PC (7300)
        Tty/Intuition        Terminal driver for Amiga using Intuition
        Tty/Termcap        Terminal driver using termcap for Unix
        Tty/Ansi        Terminal driver using Ansi codes
        Tty/Amigados        Terminal driver for Amiga using just Amigados
        Tty/Heath        Terminal driver for a Heath terminal

There currently is a major effort underway on usenet, led by Dave
Brower, to standardize microemacs and bring the many variations under
one common implementation.  Please send any enhancements to rtech!daveb,
or send them to me and I will see that he gets them.

============================ README.list37 ==============================
This is disk 37 of the freely distributable AMIGA software library.

It is port of Timothy Budd's Little Smalltalk system, done by Bill
Kinnersley at Washington State University.

The disk is unchanged except for the following:

        (1)        I have added this file, README.list37.

        (2)        I have added the standard distribution info file,
                README.dist.

        (3)        In order to make room for the above two files (the
                disk only had 2 free blocks) I filtered all the text
                files in the sources, docs, and examples directories
                through a program to remove extraneous CR (^M) characters
                from the end of each line.  This also makes the files
                conform to standard Amiga and Unix line delimiter 
                conventions.  I hope this didn't break anything else
                in the process...

        (4)        I have added the file sources/Makefile to help people
                who want to recompile the sources.  It uses my cc 
                frontend.  I was able to compile and link an executable
                that was almost the same size as the one Bill provided
                (100 bytes smaller) using Manx 3.20B in 16-bit int mode,
                but it aborted immediately with an error message, so
                beware.

This is disk 42 of the freely distributable AMIGA software library.

To quote the "Read Me First" file:

        This diskette contains the Amiga version of MicroGNUEmacs (MG),
        a small but powerful text editor that runs on many other computer
        systems besides the Amiga.  One of MG's major goals is to be
        compatible with its cousin GNU Emacs, so certain features you
        may have seen in other versions of MicroEmacs may work differently
        here, or not exist.  Hopefully, you'll find the added features MG
        provides to be worth the trouble it takes to make the switch. 

From the "Read Me Second" file:

        This is the fourth Beta distribution of MicroGnuEmacs.  Beyond the
        work of Dave Conroy, author of the original public domain v30, this
        contains the efforts of:

        mwm@ucbopal.berkeley.edu        Mike Meyer
        mic@ngp.utexas.edu                Mic Kaczmarczik
        blarson@usc-oberon.arpa                Bob Larson
        rtech!daveb@sun.com                Dave Brower

A very nice job guys!  Congratulations.

This disk is essentially unchanged except that I have added the usual
README.dist and README.list files, along with changing the volume name
to AmigaLibDisk42.  The original volume name was "MG 1a".

MemWatch        Memwatch is a program intended to sit in the background
                and watch for random trashing of low memory by an
                application under development.  If it detects a write
                to low memory, it repairs it to what used to be there,
                then puts up a requester indicating what damage had been
                done.  Very useful!
