Welcome to the First Issue of CONNECTIONS!!!  CONNECTIONS is a *NEW* Monthly
UK BBS Scene Magazine containing a comprehensive UK BBS Directory.

Many SysOps have tried their hands at generating up-to-date BBS Lists, but
most have found them too difficult to maintain and have abandoned updating
them, with the exception of the odd few, like Turbo D at @{"Alpha Zone BBS" Link AlphaZoneBBS}
who has for the last 4 months supplied a list of BBS Numbers to the AMINET.

However, most BBS Lists contain BBS Numbers of BBSes that have long since
left the scene, and of all the Lists we have encountered, there hasn't
been one that has been accurately up-to-date.

At the time of going to press, ALL the BBSes listed in CONNECTIONS have
been 100% verified as being online.  We have spent the last 2 months
ringing BBS Numbers to find out which BBSes are still online, and to find
out those that have left the scene.  We have still a lot of work to do,
but I'm sure you can appreciate the cost of dialling every BBS Number we
have found in the afore mentioned BBS Lists, and that is why we need YOUR
help in providing us with information of any BBSes you know that are still
online, that are not listed in this issue of CONNECTIONS.

Furthermore, we need YOUR help in keeping CONNECTIONS up-to-date with BBS
Closures, Relaunches, Renames etc.  For more details on how to contact us,
access @{"Submissions" Link Submissions}.

The BBS Scene is in bad need of positive publicity...and we at CONNECTIONS
strongly believe that BBS Advertising is a damn good start.  CONNECTIONS
aims to provide the AMIGA Community with a central resource of information
regarding the current status of the UK BBS Scene, with the added bonus of a
comprehensive UK BBS Directory every month.

We hope that CONNECTIONS will be received favourably by SysOps and BBS
Callers alike, and correspondence is welcomed from ALL who read this
issue.  Plans to take CONNECTIONS' coverage beyond the United Kingdom are
already under consideration, but positive feedback from this first issue
is required before we start work on incorporating GLOBAL CONNECTIONS.

We would like to point out that we do take the BBS Scene seriously, and
genuinely want to help revive what can only be described as a dying
industry, but SysOps out there must wake up to the fact that if they don't
advertise their humble abodes, then who is going to know that they are
there?  In researching for CONNECTIONS, we have come across many a SysOp,
who despite complaining of reduced Calls and lack of Users, have made no
attempt to do something about it, depite CONNECTIONS offering them a free
chance to advertise worldwide via the AMINET!!!

AMIGA FORMAT magazine recently started a column for BBS Numbers in their
Readers Adverts section, and those that have advertised, including
ourselves, have found that advertising DOES work, and that there ARE
members of the AMIGA Community who want to call BBSes, but never knew
where to get in contact with them!  Therefore in respect of all you SysOps
that think that advertising is a waste of time...we rest our case...!!!

See you Next Issue...

        @{u}Sleeping Knights Await The Dawn Of A Sunset - By Cranial Jax@{uu}

There is a legend that King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table would
return in England's greatest hour of need.  Many including this writer
believe that the legend was fulfilled during the Second World War by the
young men of the R.A.F., when Merlin engined Spitfires helped win the 
Battle of Britain.

The idea of an old hero rising from the grave to perform one glorious last
act of salvation goes right back to Christianity, and before of course.
Just perhaps there is a nugget of comfort in there for fans of the BBS and
the Amiga, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  First let's take a history
lesson.

Many of you will remember the golden days of BBSes not so long ago.  I
guess it really started with Heath Bunting's Cybercafe BBS, which was a
small text only affair frequented by literary techno-nerds.  It had STYLE.
No ANSI graphics, just a few literary and hacky type files, but boy oh boy
could you get a good CONVERSATION there.  It was mostly a PC kinda place,
but software to get to it on the Amiga was easy to come by because the
whole thing was so simple.  I even used-to access it on a Psion Organizer
(remember those old "bricks"?)!

It wasn't long before BBS software exploded into fully featured ANSI-art
packin' monsters, and with computer ownership on the rise a gigantic
network of file-based BBSes was soon spanning the globe.  It offered files
and global mail via a network called FIDO-Net.  Heath's little Cybercafe
BBS of course totally ignored all this and stayed as a stand-alone text
only thing with a tiny hard-core of fans (gosh were there as many as 30 of
us?) who thought that conversation mattered more than files and graphics.

It finally died of neglect when the Internet swept all before it.  Those
intellectuals that frequented it have gone off to closed E-Mail mailing
lists in the lesser known backwaters of the Internet, and carry on their
conversations unseen and in a great deal more privacy.  They are a
mish-mash of tiny invisible but global communities.  I belong to some of
those communities and I can honestly say that we have not lost out,
although I still have a nostalgic fondness for that early BBS, and indeed
I still keep the files and some of the messages from it in my little
museum of stuff now crammed onto a pile of CDs.

Heath's achievement and the file-piles of the big BBSes was in the days
before the computer standards competition was settled.  Then the Amiga was
a fine machine, well able to compete with the PCs and Macs of the day.
The Amiga was (and remains) well-suited to running an ANSI BBS package, so
as far as Comms were concerned Amiga users were on an equal footing and 
sometimes actually ahead of PCs and Macs.

Microsoft, IBM, and "market forces" however were to change all that.  With
no room for sentiment and without any doubt whatsover the PC won-out.
Windows, then Windows 95 became King.  The Internet mushroomed out of an
alliance of nerds, universities and the military, and the browsers needed
to use it took to the massive memories of RAM hungry Windows PCs like ducks
to the proverbial.

Er-hem, a certain Mr Gates had rather a lot riding on Windows and a great
deal of influence.  His chosen software sales technology platform was the
PC.  There was nowhere for the Amiga to go.  The Mac survived because it
had some good art software and a hardcore of middle-class afficianados who
probably believe TV is bad for you and still don't own sets yet.  Relaunch
after relaunch will not save the Mac in the long run.  Pile-'em-high and
sell-'em-cheap is the way PCs get marketed.  It's a mass market with a
massive Internet to serve the masses.  "There can be only one" as the
Highlander is heard to say.

So what of the BBS and the Amiga?  Here I get brutal and break some
hearts, but I might have something comforting to say for you all later.

The Internet is not where the Amiga is going except as an eccentric
elderly guest for a day trip.  The Amiga is not being developed in memory
and processing terms and there is no way the software to keep up with the
fast-track development of the Internet can ever be written for it.  Seen
any good Real-Video software or DVD drives for the Amiga in your branch of
Currys lately?  No.  Q.E.D.

The larger ANSI BBS's that still remain from the golden days before the
Internet are gradually dying.  One-by-one they close through lack of
users.  They still do offer quick-n-dirty file downloading with listings
and Z-Modem, and they remain a neat (only if files are encrypted of
course) way for people to swap stuff without the big brother ISPs looking.
But they don't offer for the microwave dining mobile phoning masses, even
with mail networks like FIDO-Net, a one-global-standard reliable instant 
global mail service that requires no brain whatsoever like E-Mail.  They
don't offer fancy clickable full-motion interactive Web pages to hyperlink
around the whole world.  And perhaps most importantly, there is NO money
in them.

They are amateur hobby boards like radio-hamming, that cost their
operators a packet in phone bills and time to run, simply for the love of
it.  I'm not knocking it as a hobby, but let's not pretend in 1999 that
it's ever gonna be any other way now.  Like radio-hams, some guys like to
run on the old kit.  Amigas are like Morse Code.  It's still around in
ham-land, although there's no point dit-dahring out an S.O.S. from your
boat these days 'cos distress signals in Morse aren't monitored by the
Coastguard any more.  The mass-market took a different turn some time ago.

Now here's the nice bit :-)  The millennium is upon us and the Internet is
almost damn near certain going to go belly-up for a few days or weeks when
Y2K hits.  The phones will be back a while before the Internet.  There
will be a little window of opportunity when the BBSes can satisfy the
file-addictions of the few real digerati who still have BBS software and
terminal emulators in their closets.  Like an Arthurian legend the old
guys will save the cravings of the real hardcore cyberpunks.  It could be
a lovely sunset.  Who knows I might even fire up my old BBS for a few 
days, assuming there is any electricity.

So keep those Amigas and BBS software shiny and ready for the dawn of the 
new millennium, 'cos it'd be a shame to miss the sunset of the old one.
