                          @{b}@{u}I N T R O D U C T I O N@{ub}@{uu}

Welcome to the Eleventh Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is a Monthly UK
BBS Scene Magazine containing a comprehensive UK BBS Directory.

Many SysOps have tried their hands at generating up-to-date BBS Lists, but
most have found them too difficult to maintain and have abandoned updating
them, therefore most BBS Lists contain BBS Numbers of BBSes that have long
since left the Scene, and of all the Lists we have encountered, there hasn't
been one that has been accurately up-to-date.

At the time of going to press, ALL the BBSes listed in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} have
been 100% verified as being online.  We have spent the last 13 months
ringing BBS Numbers to find out which BBSes are still online, and to find
out those that have left the Scene.  We have still a lot of work to do, but
I'm sure you can appreciate the cost of dialling every BBS Number we have
found in the afore mentioned BBS Lists, and that is why we need YOUR help
in providing us with information of any BBSes you know that are still
online, that are not listed in this Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

Furthermore, we need YOUR help in keeping @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} up-to-date with BBS
Closures, New Numbers, Relaunches, Renames etc.  For more details on how to
contact us, access @{BG fill}@{"Submissions" Link Submissions}@{BG background}.

The BBS Scene is in bad need of positive publicity...and we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
strongly believe that BBS Advertising is a damn good start.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
aims to provide the AMIGA Community with a central resource of information
regarding the current status of the UK BBS Scene, with the added bonus of a
comprehensive UK BBS Directory every month.

When we first researched for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to find out just how many BBSes
were still up and running, we were pleasantly suprised by the number we
found were still online, and those 124 BBSes we found, were entered into
the First Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  That 124 BBSes has now grown to 191 BBSes
for the Eleventh Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, just proving that the UK BBS Scene is
far from dead, as was first thought. 

From our point of view, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has really made a difference to the
number of Calls and New Users at our respective BBSes, and many of our New
Users had never been on a BBS before in their lives, the Internet, yes, but
never a BBS, as they thought that BBSes were extinct.  Feedback from other
SysOps who advertised in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} suggests that they have experienced the
same result, which proves a point, that SysOps should not just sit back and
accept the number of Users in their User-Base, but should advertise their
BBSes as much as possible, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} giving them that very chance.

AMIGA FORMAT Magazine recently started a column for BBS Numbers in their
Readers Adverts section, and those that have advertised, including
ourselves, have found that advertising DOES work, and that there ARE
members of the AMIGA Community who want to call BBSes, but never knew
where to get in contact with them!  Therefore in respect of all you SysOps
that think that advertising is a waste of time...we rest our case!!!

The Internet has done much damage to the UK BBS Scene, especially when Free
ISPs were launched, but that damage is not irrepairable, as we have proven,
and ironically @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has used the Internet to get to it's prospective
audience, to get Internet Users back to the UK BBS Scene, and it appears to
have worked, and worked well.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been well received from SysOps and BBS Users alike, and the
Correspondence we have received from Readers has been tremendous.  We
honestly didn't believe that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would be so popular, and its
thanks to your input and feedback that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has established itself
as the leading UK BBS Scene Magazine!!!

Plans to take @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}' coverage beyond the United Kingdom are already
under consideration.  Work on @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has already started, but
we foresee a problem that really needs to be addressed before we continue
any further with the project.  Basically, does the UK BBS Scene really want
an International BBS Directory?  If the answer to this questions is "Yes",
then how do we market it?  Do we release it seperately, to give YOU the
choice whether you want to Download it or not, or do we include it within
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, bearing in mind the Archive Size will probably double?

Please help us to make this decision, get in touch with us at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text},
and let us know what YOU want.  If we get no response from YOU, as Readers
of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then the @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} project will be scrapped!!!

Please keep the Correspondence coming, we would especially like to hear from
SysOps who have advertised their BBSes in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and have benefitted
as a result.  Also, if any of you have any ideas on how we can improve the
content of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, or if you have anything at all to contribute to
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then please get in touch, even if you only have a sentence or
two to say, ALL Correspondence will be read and replied to, and may even
get included in the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!

See you Next Issue...

                             @{u}A Word From Dunkie@{uu}

Welcome to a New Millennium, and another Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  I would like
to take this opportunity to apologise to @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers for the massive
delay in the release of this Issue, but I'm sure you'll all agree that
Christmas & New Year has been a busy time for everyone, and therefore it's
been pretty hard work getting the Articles and Features in for this Issue.
Not to mention, probably like most of you who read @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, I had that
awful Flu Virus in January that was all over the UK, and therefore have not
been in the best of health or frame of mind to compile and write this first
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Issue of the New Millennium :(((

Major changes have taken place in the UK BBS Scene since Last Issue, with
Cumbria and North Yorkshire being wiped off the UK BBS Scene Map as it were,
due to multiple BBS Closures in those Counties.  All in all 10 BBS Closures
were reported to @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, setting another gloomy picture for the UK BBS
Scene.  However, there was a BBS Relaunch in the case of One-2-One BBS in
London, but other than that, there really wasn't any major good news when
talking about the current status of the UK BBS Scene :(((

@{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background} operated by Pete Laird (Co-Editor Of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}) was seriously
hit by misfortune in early December, when the entire BBS and it's 34,000+
Filebase was lost due to severe Hard-Drive Failure.  This is just one of the
reasons why @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is so late, as I've been doing everything within my
power to help Pete Laird rebuild @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background} from scratch and get it back
online, something that we both have finally achieved (though there were
times when we thought we were never going to achieve it), and now after an
absence of a couple of months, the *NEW* @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background} is back online, serving
the UK BBS Community AGAIN :)))

Other BBS related news, was that The @{BG fill}@{"FluffyNet" Link FluffyNet}@{BG background} Mail Network changed hands
(AGAIN) Mid-December, and now presides in Lincoln rather than in Newport,
Isle Of Wight.  Indeed @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}' own S.N.S (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Skull Monkey BBS" Link SkullMonkeyBBS}@{BG background})
has now the honour of running @{BG fill}@{"FluffyNet" Link FluffyNet}@{BG background}, taking over from it's previous
owner, Steve Clack (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Total Eclipse BBS" Link TotalEclipseBBS}@{BG background}), who sighted problems with
not having the time to operate and maintain @{BG fill}@{"FluffyNet" Link FluffyNet}@{BG background} adequately.

The Millennium Bug...just what was all the fuss about?  Well, although the
Bug didn't really strike as was predicted, some SysOp's Systems were struck,
and a few of this month's closures are down to a Year 2000 Problem, either
with their System or with their BBS Software, so even the AMIGA it appears
did not fully escape the Year 2000 Problem thanks to Software, rather than
Hardware, which is something that SysOps with old 486 PCs probably would
have preferred!!! <GRIN>

The Big Question that's on everyone's lips at the moment, is can the UK BBS
Scene survive in the 21st Century?  Is there room for the BBS amongst the
ever increasing Telecommunications Industry.  I believe there is, and I also
believe that better times are coming, with the introduction of Unmetered
Internet Calls, and ADSL.  Both these could infact benefit the UK BBS Scene,
rather than hinder it.  I think BBSes are going to have adapt to using the
Internet as a means for Users to access them, using TelNet is a good example.
I hope to have more coverage on TelNet in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} in the not too distant
future, so look out for that, or indeed if you already know about TelNet, or
even use it, then share your knowledge and expertise with the rest of us,
and write to @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} and @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers about it.

The fundamental fact about BBS Survival, is that it is up to YOU, YOU as
SysOps, and YOU as Users.  It has to be a partnership, but the biggest
responsibility lies on SysOps to make the rest of the World know you are
there providing a Service, and making sure that you do indeed provide that
Service.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been running now for nearly a year, and yet still
it appears that SysOps can't or won't get the message.  They need to really
make an effort in bringing their BBSes into the Public Eye, and as I've said
until I'm blue in the face, ADVERTISING is the key!!!  AMIGA FORMAT, thanks
to my hard work, runs a FREE BBS Adverts Column, regardless whether you are
an AMIGA or PC BBS, it doesn't matter...a BBS is a BBS regardless what
System it runs on.  So, why is it that only a dozen SysOps, out of 191 have
made the effort to use this FREE Service???  Come on guys, you are missing
out on a brilliant opportunity, an opportunity that pays dividends, ask the
SysOps who advertise in AMIGA FORMAT's pages, they'll all tell you the same
story, that they've all had New Users as a result of Advertising, and in my
case, I've been getting an Average of 10 New Users a Month!!!

The UK BBS Scene is dying, we all know that, and there's no point denying
it, but there are those of us out there, who despite all the odds, are
still achieving results, which means that there are people out there, who
still want BBSes, and while ever there's that market, we should do
everything within our power not to disappoint it.  It's far easier for you
to get people to call your BBS, than it is for you to get people BACK to
calling your BBS once you've disappointed them, so let's ALL make an effort
and hold our heads up high and prove the critics wrong...let's take the UK
BBS Scene into the new Millennium...and beyond!!!

                              @{u}A Word From Pete@{uu}

In early December 1999, @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background} vanished in the blink of an eye, gone
were 34,400 Files, gone was a Userbase of 498, and lastly, gone was 3 years
of a hobby I really loved doing.  OK I thought, it was good while it lasted,
but what's gone is gone there is plenty of other things I can do, play Games
on the PC which I got from a mate, and even spend a Christmas doing things
normal people do, eat, drink, watch the television and not have to make sure
that there were new Files online for those people who call over the Festive
Season.

So, over the next four or five weeks I tried to get on with other things,
but there is so much you can take moving little men around and killing
aliens in UFO: Terror From The Deep.  Then I got the first pangs of BBS
withdrawal symptoms, so let's try to start up a BBS on the PC I thought,
but found the Software not as User friendly as MAX's, and out of the
corner of my eye, I could see my burnt out AMIGA, with its trashed mother-
board and buggered Hard-Drive.

With the help from my mate, we built up the AMIGA again with bits and bobs
he begged from others, and we got it working again.  So, with a borrowed
1GB Hard-Drive, I started to re-create @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background} on the AMIGA, but even
then I was unsure if I was doing the right thing.  2 months is a long time
to be offline, Users of BBSes don't hang around, they move on to pastures
new, but I went ahead regardless and things got better when my mate swapped
the electrics of my 4.3GB Hard-Drive with one of his old ones, and now I had
it all back, my AMIGA, my Hard-Drive and finally put @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background} back online
with a very small Filebase and a fingers-crossed SysOp.

So, to all those people who used to call @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}, it's now back and on
it's way once again, so give us a call on 0116-278-7773 24hrs ;)

Finally I would like to thank the following people for there valued help in
getting me started up again:-

Dunkie (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}) who was Chief Beta Tester for @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}.
Ninja (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Arachnoids BBS" Link ArachnoidsBBS}@{BG background}) for sorting out my Hard-Drive.
S.N.S (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Skull Monkey BBS" Link SkullMonkeyBBS}@{BG background}) for his help with the AREXX Scripts.
My mate Neil for resurrecting and rebuilding my AMIGA A1200 :)))

And lastly, I'd like to thank the 16 Users who called @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background} in the
first week of its relaunch...many thanks for the Files lads, keep'em
coming!!!

It's good to be back :)

See you Next Issue...

            @{u}A Few Thoughts On The BBS Scene - By Kevin McAspurn@{uu}

Recently I have been reading quite a lot about the BBS Scene, and how much
it has changed due to the rise in popularity of the Internet.  There seems
to be much confusion about how the Scene can survive, given that the BBS
could appear irrelevant alongside the cheap access, and fancy Graphics of
the Web.  I don't intend to try to set the world to rights here, but I would
like to throw my two penn'orth into the debate.
   
If you were a Comms fan just two or three years ago, there was probably a
BBS in your local area, so you could get online at local call rate, although
on the more popular Boards, you often had to wait until the small hours,
because they were always busy.  Nowadays, Boards are much more thinly spread
around, and I'm sorry to say, the general quality has declined (with
noteable exceptions).  So, nowadays it probably costs you more to Dial
you're nearest Board, and it may not be good enough to keep you coming back.
  
I'm not going to discuss the relative merits of The Net versus the BBS,
because there just isn't any point.  It's not a competition anyway, they are
two separate entities, but the BBS Scene is definitely overshadowed by The
Net, because there's a lot of money to be made from it, and it's been hyped
up by the people making the money.  The BBS Scene, on the other hand, has
never shouted about itself, probably because the people at it's heart have
always been Amateurs, who usually end up spending lots of money just to
pursue the hobby they enjoy. 
  
So what's to be done?  How do we halt the decline in the number of Boards?

Well, for a start, let's use The Net to advertise the presence of the BBS
Scene.  I'm sure that there are lots of Net Users out there that don't even
know what a BBS is, never mind what it does.  Some of them may log onto a
Board for the first time, and failing to be impressed by the lack of
flashiness, decide never to bother again.  This is a price that has to be
paid, I think, in order to get to the people who do understand what a BBS is
about, who understand that it's a much more personal relationship than you
can have with a Web-Site.  Also the BBS Column in AMIGA FORMAT really works,
(Thanks Dunkie (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background})).  Personally, I got back into Comms
after an absence of a couple of years, after seeing the BBS Adverts in AMIGA
FORMAT.  There must be others out there just like me, so if you're running a
BBS, for God's sake advertise, you're not going to get many calls if no-one
knows you're there.

Next, we need to maintain high standards, because New Users aren't going to
return to Boards which don't have some good Software, or a consistent theme.
I'm quite aware that it can take some time, and much hard work, to get a
Board to a reasonable standard, and this is where we can all help by
spreading the best Software.  I know that todays Cover CDs have loads of
stuff on them, and can make it seem pointless to look for new stuff on a BBS,
but I also think that it's easier to find something on a BBS Filelist, than
trawl through everything on a CD to find something worth adding to your
system.  So if you find something good, then Upload it to your BBS, and let
us all know about it.

New SysOps need to have patience, because todays BBS is less likely to have
Ratios, therefore more 'troughing' goes on, and less Files are Uploaded,
which of course means that it takes longer to build up a good Software
library, and by the time time you have, less of it is likely to be current.
They may also have some teething troubles, which they may not even know
about.  For example, a couple of years ago, a New Board appeared in my area,
but however much I tried, I could not get a connection.  I tried to phone
the SysOp to tell him, but no-one ever answered, so I gave up.  The Board
soon disappeared, presumably through lack of Calls.  Another point I could
make is, be online when your advert says you will.  This might sound stupid,
but I have called Boards, well after their opening time, and had a voice
answering the Modem, and yes, I did double check the time!!!  Nevertheless,
I was still embarassed to have given someone's Wife/Granny/Baby-Sitter an
earful of binary, and the important thing of course, is that it made me very
wary of calling back. 

Let's also look at ways in which a BBS can serve it's Users better.  What
about using them as Virtual User Groups.  I know many Boards are well down
this path, but if it was pushed hard, I think this could go a long way
toward gaining more loyalty from the Users.  After all, people are not going
to run up their Phone Bill just to support a Board, but they are much more
likely to call if there is something else to be gained.  Another advantage
is that most Board's Users are at least fairly local, so there is more
opportunity for face-to-face meetings with other Users.  Most Boards already
have Message areas, what about special areas for Technical Help, and perhaps
Users with specialist knowledge could advertise this on their local Board.
This could then be spread by this very Magazine, so if someone far off
needed help, they could leave a message on the Helper's local Board, and
call back after a few days to pick up their reply, result, more people using
the BBS Network in a rewarding way.

Before finishing, I'd like to say that if anyone has anything to say about
this Article, then let's be hearing from you.  The more Users that join the
debate, the better the ideas that come out of it.

Regards...

              @{u}I'm Tired - By Saddletramp (SysOp Of Sniper BBS)@{uu}

Yes...I'm tired.  For several years I've been blaming it on middle-age, poor
blood, lack of vitamins, air pollution, the greenhouse effect, obesity,
dieting, nightshift, under-arm odours, wax build up and another dozen
maladies that make you wonder if life is really worth living.  I've now
found out that:-

I'M TIRED BECAUSE I'M OVERWORKED!!!

The population of this country is 51 million, of which 21 million are
retired.  That leaves 30 million to do the work.

19 million are at School, leaving 11 million to do the work.

Of this total, 2 million (?) are un-employed and 4 million 'work' for the
Government, leaving 5 million to do the work.

1 million are in the Armed Forces and 3 million are in the City Borough
Councils, cutting the number of people who work to 1 million.

There are 620,000 people in Hospital, and 379,998 in Prison (or on the
roof).

That leaves 2 people actually working - YOU and ME!!!

You are sitting on your arse reading this.

NO WONDER I'M BLOODY TIRED!!!

        @{u}The Views & Memories Of A Former SysOp - By Matthew Clayton@{uu}

I would like to start by saying I first got into Computers at an age of
about nine-years-old, and yes, when 8-Bit Computers were at the height of
cutting edge technology.  I first learnt by using, what I can remember, a
BBC Micro Model B.  It was the most advanced Computer at the time, and if
you where lucky, your local School had one.  Well, as I myself suffered
learning disabilities, I was sent to a Private School, where I learnt to
overcome my learning problems and this is where I found I was able to unlock
my skills and show how I could learn, and how Computers could help me right
up to the year 2000, and to this day, I still rely on them heavily.

My first ever Computer was a Spectrum ZX128 +2 (Tape), and WOW!!!  8-Bit
Graphics, and what was so modern, that the Games could be changed and be got
from every Toy Shop, Computer Shop and or Electronic Superstore, i.e. Dixons,
where I got my beloved Spectrum from.  It was not even a year before I had
the hard job of telling Mum & Dad that it was out-of-date, and was just not
flexible for my needs, and I traded it in for a Spectrum ZX128 +3.  And yes,
after not too long I gave it to my Mum, who right upto nowadays has followed
my lead in Computers and has tried to stay with it all.  My next Computer
platform was Amstrad.  Not too long after that I went from the CPC 464 (Tape)
to the CPC 6128 (Disk) and I soon found I was back at my ZX problem, I was
limited by my Graphics and Sound.

1995, the year of Live Aid, and I was just about to discover the world of
AMIGA, and I remember to the very day entering Dixons and looking at the
mega-display that Commodore had paid and layed on for Dixons, and showed my
Mum that that would be my future for many years, and after being told to
wander round the Shop, I found that Mum had juggled the books (like parents
do) and had got me my first AMIGA 500, the Batman/New Zealand Story Pack,
with a mega 512K Memory (I didn't know at the time what that was).  Let me
see, oh yes I soon found the power of 16-Bit Graphics in a some what 4096
Colours and being a young cheeky ten-year-old, I saw my first digital stored
picture and what a suprise, SHE WAS NAKED!!!  I soon saw the power of AMIGA
and worked my way through the AMIGA range, from 500 to 1200 and then to a
1200 + Blizzard 1260-060, and I soon found it was time to 'Tower-Up', so
armed with a hacksaw and my AMIGA, I towered my baby up and installed some
demo BBS Software, and I found myself for some time running a BBS, and I am
so glad that I shared my memories with AMIGA in the BBS World, and I always
have and will remember the memories I have with AMIGA.

After a long, and can I say a sad time of thinking, I have made the hard
choice of deciding to sell ALL my AMIGAs, and move to my newly built PC.  I
know what you might be thinking, and saying that this whole article is to
give a bad name to AMIGA and make people sell-up, well...No, after a long
time of AMIGA and seeing all my friends get PCs, I still decided to hang in
with the AMIGA, but due to my College Work I have had to decide not to spoil
or disturb those brilliant memories I have of AMIGA, and informed my friend
Dunkie (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}/Editor Of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}), that I would be saying
Goodbye to the AMIGA.

But I will always speak well of AMIGA, and have enjoyed the memories I have,
and how it has helped me get on in life.  So I would like to end with my
last thought, maybe one day I can return back to AMIGA when they get back
on their feet, and if they do, I will not hesitate to return back to AMIGA.

             @{u}What I Miss From The BBS Scene - By Hugo Wilkinson@{uu}

The Readers Articles seem to be loosely based around the same thing over
Last Month's @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, so I thought I would start to supply a steady
stream of (hopefully) interesting articles.

The first is going to be about what I believe the BBS Scene currently lacks.

As Jim Delaney (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Electric Box BBS" Link ElectricBoxBBS}@{BG background}) pointed out, the technology
behind BBSes is exactly the same as that used by the Internet.  In other
words, whatever the Internet supplies, the BBSes can do also (even a
miniature version of IRC isn't going to be difficult)!!!

These facts alone has somewhat surprised me in the huge decrease of BBS
Users.  Using a BBS is so much more of a learning and different experience
that again, it amazes me that so many people left!!!

The next thing I'm concerned about is that, now that everyone has had a
taste of the Internet.  Why aren't they returning to the BBSes???

What the bugger makes the Internet sooooo good that BBSes should be chucked
out of the window altogether???

I think the answer lays in information.

<Employ old man type speech>

Back in 1994 when I first started to use BBSes (and got my AMAZING £80
2400bps Modem (damn FAST for the time I'm telling you!!!)), I called all
the BBSes I could find under the Sun.  Even the AMIGA FORMAT 300+ page
AMIGA STARTER Compilation Magazine (a 6 month special), had about 6 A4 pages
dedicated to BBSes.  You could even sign up to Compuserve over a BBS at the
time (not sure if you still can though)!!!

Anyway, even if the Internet had existed and had so many Users and
facilities as it does today, BBSes would still be a hugely popular thing.

During this period of time, it was not uncommon for people to call European
BBSes (especially one called AMIGA Central, I think) and at that time the
UK's most busiest AMIGA BBS was AMIGAOne.  It was so busy infact, that the
SysOp had 3 lines and 2 PREMIUM lines.  You could either pay for a 
subscription and Download Files, or not pay a subscription and use the
Premium lines for Downloading.  You could also speak (in real time) to up to
20 other people on the BBS as the biggest BBSes kept a 24-Hour Network open.

That was a point in time where there were hundreds of Callers a day, rather
than a month.

In 1996 we saw a slow transformation of BBSes.  Hundreds of teenager's took
up the band wagon (with the help of MAX's) and started to open small BBSes
with not nearly the amount of facilities and Mail Networks, but a huge File-
Base within (usually) specialist subjects, i.e. There was like a BBS for
THIS and a BBS for THAT (e.g. Adults, Astronomy, Hacking etc), and because
of these specialist areas the SysOps were able to put alot of effort into
producing a top quality BBS with all the latest info and programs on a
particular subject.

This new age of virtually FREE BBSes caused huge traffic reductions to the
larger subscription BBSes.  AMIGAOne was a perfect example to fall at this
time.

By late 1997 there were only a few big BBSes left (and I can only really
remember Test Drive BBS as being hugely successful).  Then another
transformation took place.

Due to the lack of big GENERAL BBSes, all the specialist BBS's took heed
and started producing File-Base's for the masses.  Utility sections galore,
Game sections galore, and probably the biggest turn over of Calls made by
Pornography.

This was all free and because of the general selection of SysOps around at
the time (under-paid students hehe), the Files were all coming from the same
place.  Once a File hit one BBS, it was on ALL within a week.  It became
like a PC Market.  Lots of different names for the same bloody thing!!!

Then, the Internet attack proceeded, and what anyone could get on any BBSes
was suddenly available with nice graphics and point'n'click features.

If BBSes had stayed in a sort of 'specialist' mode, then I don't think the
BBS Scene would be in such a mess as it is today.

Infact, if you're a SysOp reading this, ask yourself "What can my BBS
significantly offer over any other BBS I know of?"...

I would imagine that for most of you the answer would be a 'Mail Network'.
@{BG fill}@{"FluffyNet" Link FluffyNet}@{BG background} used to be the biggest (apart from FidoNet of course), but now
even that has died...(good too, that put me out of business!!!) <GRIN>

On a lighter note, I would love to see the BBS Scene take off again.

It is an excellent community of people, and the whole feel of BBSes is a lot
nicer than that of the Internet, including a damn lot cheaper in some cases
too!!!

Over and out...

       @{u}Reply To 'The BBS Scene' - By Neil Williams (SysOp Of TKG BBS)@{uu}

I've just read a letter in Last Month's @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} from Chris Seward (my
boss, I'd better be nice ;)), the Editor of AMIGA Information Online (AIO)
no less, and was astounded by what I read.  He talks of the days of the BBS
in 1995 are now gone in 1999.  In the UK this is true, at least partially
for the moment, but is certainly not true in places where cheap 24-Hour
Internet Connections are readily available.  The USA is undergoing a huge
BBS revival, after quite some downfall (far more so than in all of Europe).

The difference is ADSL.  Chris talks about not many SysOps having taken the
plunge with TelNet BBSes.  This is because it is almost impossible in the UK.
It's fine to talk about All-Day Sunday BBSes, using the various Free Weekend
Services, but this is not practical!!!  Not many Call Part-Time BBSes via
Modem, how many would Call a One-Day BBS running at a speed often less than
1KB/S?

There are many success stories being related in the Networks about *NEW*
TelNet BBSes.  It's even got to the point where some USA SysOps are taking a
holier-than-thou stance with respect to Dial-Up BBSes - as they are now
taking hundreds of Calls a week, and don't understand that in the UK the
government has been restricting ADSL in the name of `increasing competition'
(of all the excuses)!!!  It won't be until 2001 that we have a reasonable
coverage of ADSL capable exchanges here.

It is also important to see the Internet for what it is.  It uses similar
technology to existing Phone Lines, the difference being that it is all
permanently connected (or will be once *USERS* world-wide get 24-Hour
Internet Connections) and `long distance' charges no longer exist - funnily
enough, Arthur C Clarke predicted this in one of the 2001 novels, though if
it was 3001 it wasn't much of a prediction :-)

I realise that near the end of his Article, Chris makes a distinction
between Dial-Up and TelNet BBSes, but please remember that they are one and
the same, they are not mutually exclusive, they do the same thing: only the
method of connection is different.  A TelNet BBS is still a 'BBS' in every
meaning of the word, just like a Dial-Up BBS.  It is important for us not to
say "The BBS is dead, long live TelNet" - then you give potential Users the
impression that TelNet BBSes are about to go the way of Gopher.  Try "The
BBS is dead, long live the BBS" instead!!!

Let's not forget the BBS' other strength - as home of the FTN Networks.
What is a Web-Site, if nothing more than a very non-interactive and
impersonal BBS?  What is UseNet, but Pornography, Spam, and Death Threats?
FidoNet still exists, there are still 15,000 and more Nodes in it, and
Russia is leading the way in FidoNet expansion with new BBSes (yes, even
Dial-Up Systems) opening all the time.  What about AMIGANet?  Last count,
more than 500 Nodes in EuroAsia alone.  The Internet is being used today to
move Fido-style Networks around, using E-Mail 'tunneling' and TelNet to
connect Mailers in *EXACTLY* the same way as it would be done over a Dial-Up
Line.

Oh, and a final word:  Yes Chris, I know Anthony Brice - I bought his copy
of the Zeus BBS Software when he closed the Backyard BBS :-)  In fact, I
liked Zeus BBS so much I bought the company!!!

<plug> http://www.bleach.demon.co.uk/zeus/ </plug> ;-)

And for the record I'm not writing this to sell more copies of Zeus BBS, I
genuinely believe in the BBS Scene, and BBS Software is my way of
contributing.

        @{u}AMIGA: Back For The Future? - By Dunkie (SysOp Of Quest BBS)@{uu}

AMIGA Changes Hands...AGAIN!!!  Do we jump up for joy at the News, or simply
shake our heads in despair, knowing that yet again the AMIGA's troubled life
story starts ALL over again?

GATEWAY, after all this time indeed dumped the AMIGA, and came clean over
it's true reasons for buying the AMIGA in the first place, just as I hoped
they would do, but the new owners of the AMIGA name, AMINO, in my opinion
are just as obscure as some of the previous owners of the AMIGA.  A newly
formed company, that appears to have no manufacturing experience, that has
just forked out a reported $5 million to purchase the AMIGA in name alone.
Even though this company is owned by former AMIGA Inc employees, even though
they of ALL people must truly care about the AMIGA, doesn't guarantee any
future for the AMIGA at all, as the AMIGA Community has dwindled drastically,
and still IS doing, ever since GATEWAY scrapped plans to build the next-
generation AMIGA MCC last year :(((

Ben Vost (Editor Of AMIGA FORMAT) stated that in the last 6 months, his
readership has dropped by approximately 40%, showing that a majority of the
AMIGA Community appears to have had enough, and called it a day.  Can you
blame them?  The last 6 years have brough nothing but heartache to the AMIGA
Community, with AMIGA constantly changing hands, new AMIGAs being promised
and then undelivered, and even though the AMIGA looks to be in the best
hands of any of it's previous owners, for many in the AMIGA Community, all
of this has come too late :(((

As I said a few Issues back, the AMIGA doesn't have a future in it's present
form.  The PC Industry is so huge now, with it's ever expanding new
technology readily available to the Buyer on the High Street.  The AMIGA has
no real friends in the High Street, and a lot of work will have to be done
to gain High Street confidence in the AMIGA platform again, and the last 6
years of AMIGA history will not help in this task.

In my opinion, it won't matter what happens with the AMIGA platform in the
next few months, it won't matter what kick-ass machine they develop and
eventually build, because without adequate marketing or availability to the
Buyer in the High Street, their efforts will be, to be honest, worthless.

Basically, before the AMIGA can truly be resurrected, the new owners of
AMIGA have one hell of a mountain to climb, and it's terrain is going to be
the toughest they've ever seen...good luck guys...you're going to need it!!!

        @{u}How To Run A Successful BBS - By Dunkie (SysOp Of Quest BBS)@{uu}

Here at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, we get many complaints from SysOps that Callers have
dwindled to such a level, that basically they no longer put any effort into
their BBSes, but just leave them online in the hope that things will improve.
Speaking as a SysOp rather than the Editor of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, I can tell you
that this is not the case everywhere, and if you are prepared to put some
time and thought into your BBS, it does pay off.

@{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background} is my own BBS, and I've been running studies for the last 3 Years,
basically to monitor BBS Activity.  Now if I was to tell you that last year
alone I had an average of just over 180 Calls a month, how would that
compare to you?  Furthermore I can tell you that none of those 180+ Calls
had anything to do with Polling Mail, because that facility isn't available
on my BBS yet!!!

If you take into consideration that @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background} is also only a part-time BBS,
not 24-Hours, how do you explain it's popularity?  The answer is plain and
simply, because I put the effort into making @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background} a place that people
will want to visit time and time again, and this is something that ALL
SysOps should be looking at achieving!!!

I've created this Article to assist SysOps in achieving results, it's my
little way of trying to help SysOps to basically help themselves, and
indeed the restore the reputation of the UK BBS Scene:-

                          @{b}T O P   T E N   T I P S@{ub}

@{b}[01]@{ub} Try to make your BBS different by customising your BBS Software,
     giving your BBS a fresh new-look, with the use of Colourful ANSI Menus
     and Screens.  This will seperate your BBS from other BBSes using the
     same BBS Software, and give your BBS a unique feel to the BBS User.

@{b}[02]@{ub} Adapt your BBS to your Users' needs, listen to their needs and act upon
     where you can.  Remember, there's no point in offering a service no-one
     wants.  If you don't provide what your Users want, they'll find another
     BBS that will!!!

@{b}[03]@{ub} Always answer your Users' Mail, the amount of SysOps who ignore Users'
     Mail is disgusting!!!  Always converse with your Users, it'll make them
     feel that YOU, the SysOp, is approachable and create that more friendly
     environment, which in my opinion is the BBS' biggest weapon in the
     fight against the Internet...take heed!!!

@{b}[04]@{ub} Keep your BBS Users informed on any new developments on your BBS, any
     new additions and services, and any forthcoming news regarding your
     BBS.  Remember that Users are Gold to your BBS, without them your BBS
     is worthless.  You must provide Users with an incentive to call again,
     again and again, and providing Users with information on the progress
     of your BBS, is one such way of doing this.

@{b}[05]@{ub} Try to keep your BBS open through the Night, most SysOps agree that the
     majority of Callers call during late-evening/early-morning.  This means
     your BBS will be available for the biggest percentage of BBS Users.

@{b}[06]@{ub} Make sure you stick to your specified BBS operating times, there's
     nothing more frustrating for Users, than listening to someone shouting
     "Hello" down the Modem, or the Modem not answering when your BBS is
     advertised to be online.  This will most likely, no, I'd say definetly,
     result in Users not attempting to call your BBS again!!!

@{b}[07]@{ub} Make sure you have a wide selection of File areas on your BBS, making
     sure that it's wasy for your Users to find what they are looking for.
     Don't cram loads of Files into one File area, try to split them down
     into seperate File areas, making it easier for your Users to list each
     area and see what you have to offer.  Managing your File areas in this
     manner, also creates the illusion that you have more than you really
     have, again a good selling point for your BBS.

@{b}[08]@{ub} Try and add Files to your BBS on a regular basis, try adding a few
     Files daily, even if it's only a few.  You'll find that when your Users
     come online, that those few Files will have grown to a decent amount
     when they next call, assuming your Users do not call everyday.  This
     looks good to the User, and is more likely to result in Users calling
     more regularly.

@{b}[09]@{ub} Be generous with or even abolish File ratios on your BBS, there simply
     isn't any point in enforcing this policy on today's BBS.  Users tend
     to use their limit, and then usually grab anything they can lay their
     hands on to Upload, which usually results with you having unwanted
     Uploads, in my case I used to get handfulls of crappy WAV Files, which
     were neither use or ornament to anyone, including myself.  So, why not
     take the view that the User is calling your BBS at HIS expense, in
     preference to anyone or anything else, and be grateful that he/she is
     calling your BBS, rather than someone elses!!!  If you respect this
     judgement, you'll find your Modem buzzing :)))
    
@{b}[10]@{ub} Advertise your BBS everywhere you possibly can, and make it clear the
     between times your BBS is operating.  AMIGA FORMAT now runs a *FREE*
     BBS Adverts column, so if you want to advertise your BBS in the pages
     of AMIGA FORMAT, then send your BBS Advert (no more than 30 words) to
     amformat@futurenet.co.uk, putting Reader Adverts/BBS Adverts in the
     Subject Line.  If you ask other SysOps to advertise your BBS for you
     on their BBSes, always, I repeat, always return the favour!!!

This Article is merely my opinion, and should be treat accordingly, but it's
an Article that when put into practice, as the evidence indisputedly shows,
does infact achieve benefitial results for your BBS.  If you'd like to add
your input to this Article, or indeed if you agree/disagree with this
Article, then get in touch with @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and let us hear your voice.

As Kevin McAspurn's @{BG fill}@{"Article" Link KevinMcAspurn}@{BG background}, in this very Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, states,
"The more people that join the debate, the better the ideas that come out of
it", and I whole heartedly agree with that statement.  So...don't just sit
there silent, let us ALL listen to YOUR unique perspective on this matter,
and together we may be able to solve some of the problems that are plagueing
the UK BBS Scene today!!!

        @{u}AMIGA Press Release - By Bill McEwen (President/CEO Of AMIGA)@{uu}

January 3rd, 2000

Yee-Haw and welcome to the year 2000;

I want to make something very clear from the beginning we have been told,
that Amiga was purchased by Gateway because of the Patents, and that there
were not even aware of the Amiga installed base, or the people.

Gateway purchased Amiga because of Patents, we purchased Amiga because of
the People.

Without the people standing behind, developing, creating, purchasing and
continuing to believe in the Amiga there never would have been anything for
Gateway to purchase.  We recognize this, and it is because of you, and what
you have continued to accomplish with Amiga that we have purchased the
company.

I want to make sure that everyone knows and understands what this all means
to you the true Amigans.

Here is what was acquired from Gateway:

1. All trademarks logo's etc.
2. All existing inventory of Amiga International.
3. All existing licenses.
4. License to All Amiga patents
   (Gateway still owns the patents, but we are able to use them).
5. All web-sites, and registered domain names.
6. The Amiga OS and all that is associated with the OS.
7. The Amiga operation as it exists today.

Specific details of the developer system, the OS partners and how one can
begin developing will be released in the next couple of weeks.

We will be making an announcement on January 8th, 2000 with one of our
partners at CES in Las Vegas, and more details will follow that release.

Fleecy, Myself, Petro, and the rest of the team are not going to make
promises and create presentations and demos.  We are going to deliver
products, services, and the rest of the world will know what you have
already known.

We will be officially changing the name of Amino Development Corporation to
the Amiga Corporation this week, and we will let everyone know of this
change shortly once it is officially completed.

I want to thank all of you for your continued support we will make Amiga
what it should have been, and more importantly what it will be.

Keeping the faith,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   @{u}AMIGA & Tao-Group Enter Into A Strategic Relationship - Press Release@{uu}

January 8th, 2000

Las Vegas, NV, January 8th, 2000 - Amiga begins expressing plans for the new
Amiga with a strategic alliance with Tao-Group.

"Things started going wrong the moment the PC rode into town and the home
computer revolution of the 1980s ground to a halt.  We are here to right
that wrong" said Bill McEwen, Amiga's El Presidente.  "We kind of feel
guilty about not having been around to show the world the evils of the PC,
but inept management sent the Amiga off to a bad place.  Luckily, its users
and devlopers have kept it alive, and now we are back."

"Existing products are very rude" he continued.  "Shoving PCI slots,
interrupts, file systems, registries, megahertz and megabytes right into
your face.  My grandmother just wants to play a game, or send an E-Mail, or
draw a picture.  She doesn't want to have to mortgage the house and get a
masters degree."

"Digital Technology has become stalled because of the predominance of
Windows" quipped in Fleecy Moss.  "Putting a thousand monkeys on typewriters
may eventually produce the works of Shakespeare but it's not something
you're going to wait around for, and you don't want to be responsible for
cleaning up the mess in the meantime."

"Our approach is outrageous.  WE look at what actual people want, and then
give them the most simple, elegant solution.  Even calling it computing is
falling into the PC trap.  It is participation in the digital content
universe, whether it be developing an application, playing a game, making
your own video, watching TV or buying S&M gear online.  Computing companies
are trying to paint digital convergence as computers and TVs coming
together, so they can stick 'TV' in front of PC and continue to sell the
same old garbage.  Digital Convergence is something much bigger though.  It
is about content, information, services, and activity transforming into a
digital format and coming together in a single place that has no boundaries.
If someone tells you you need a PC to get into this new content universe,
smile nicely and hit them with a big stick."

"Elegance, simplicity, invisible and universal technology" sings Bill McEwen,
trying to get a word in edgeways.  "That is why we are just giddy to be
working with the Tao-Group.  Others rant on how their products are next
generation, warp capable, but the truth is that most of them are based upon
old concepts and architectures - that's why you need the latest monster
machine just to type letters.  Chris Hinsley (CTO/Tao-Group) was one of
those smartass child prodigies you wanted to beat up at school.  By age 20,
he had already been a commercial games developer for 5 years, and wrote some
great Amiga games.  Being a smartass though, he saw the future, realised
nothing out there was ready for it, and dedicated the last ten years of his
life to making sure the human race was ready when the future arrived."

"The Amiga was special because it refused to settle for second best.  If
something is wroth doing, it is worth doing right, and the proof of that is
in the global following that it still has today.  With the nightmare of the
past five years behind us, the Amiga is ready to push out ahead again, and
save the future from a muddled, poorly fitting, frustrated PC enema.  With
the foundation that the Tao-Group gives us, we are ready to re-introduce the
world to a novel computer concept - fun."

"We aren't stupid enough to think it's going to be easy", interrupts Fleecy
Moss, shoving McEwen to the ground and gagging him.  "A lot of people have
been brainwashed by the advertisements and the slick salespeople.  However,
the digital information revolution is all around us, waiting to happen.
Everyone can feel it, everyone wants to be part of it.  Amiga is going to
stick a pretty big bomb under that PC logjam and blow it clean back to
Redmond.  Elegance, simplicity, invisible and universal technology.  Time
to start smiling again."

"We are happier than a crocodile at a waterpark to be working with Amiga"
said Francis Charig, (CEO/Tao-Group) and international stud.  "We are very
proud of what we have created in our garden shed.  We could have sold out
long ago, but the market was crowded with companies doing that so we decided
to actual create a product and make it a good one.  Now we are finding that
OEMs are seeing our product and getting even more excited about it than we
are ourselves; it almost makes the whipping and torture we have had to
inflict on our employees worthwhile.  An Amiga solution powered by Tao
technology is a match made in heaven for everyone."

        @{u}AMIGA Press Release - By Bill McEwen (President/CEO Of AMIGA)@{uu}

February 3rd, 2000

Greetings to one and all:

A great deal has occurred over the last couple of weeks, and it is only
going to get more interesting as we move forward.  It has been some time
since I spoke with you, and I wanted to share some of the fun.

In the last two weeks we have announced our new foundation partner, started
technical training with our new development team, and had many meetings with
future technology partners.

The responses have been overwhelmingly positive and, to quote an old song
"they ain't seen nothing yet".

On January 8, 2000 at CES in Las Vegas we announced our partnership with the
Tao-Group as our foundation OS partner.  This is not just a technical but a
strategic relationship and brings with it great rewards.  I have asked
Fleecy to write a short document highlighting the Amiga/Tao relationship
from a more technical perspective, to save you from having to put up with my
telling everyone how incredibly great and fantastic it is.  We want you to
make your own minds up.

In the next two weeks we will make another strategic partnership
announcement with regards to the new path for Amiga.  As with all our
announcements, look at it against the whole picture and not in isolation.

After a week long trip to Germany and the UK I have come back with a much
better understanding of what we can and cannot do.  As mentioned before we
are not going to make promises or product announcements.  We will announce
to you, the community, only after the deal is signed or the product is
sitting before us.  This won't put a stop to rumours, but it will make them
all the more obvious.  Change brings uncertainty, and in an information
vacuum, mischief makers like to take the spotlight.  If it isn't officially
sanctioned by Amiga, don't believe it.

Our job as a company is to create exciting market opportunities for Amiga
developers to take advantage of, and to give Amiga users a platform they can
enjoy.  This requires more than just an upgrade to the existing OS.  This
requires, indeed demands a complete strategy reaching into all areas of the
present and the future.  The time has come for all of us to move forwards,
owner, developer, and user.

Many of you have sent us business proposals, and product marketing ideas,
and for this we thank you, and ask for your patience as we look over them.
Some are providing us with valuable insight into the desires of the Amiga
community as a whole, others are providing us with a good chuckle.  This is
the Amiga advantage that other platforms just do not share.

Over the next few months there may be some companies that come out with
their own plans, or state that we do not have the community at heart as we
move forwards.  The reality is, they do not know what we have planned.  In
order to stay focused and to keep up our incredible pace, we are not sharing
our plans outside of our signed partnerships.  

We have to prioritise and act singlemindedly if we are to reach our first
plateau in our given timescales.  Once there we will be able to pause for
breath.  Some are not happy about this, but they do not know the full plan.
Our mission is not just about restoring the Amiga, but about pushing it
forwards as THE technology for tomorrow. 

This means that if you hear something annoying, or frustrating, or downright
nasty, and the source is not Amiga Inc, then disregard it.

Plain and simple.

If you did not hear it from us, or did not read it on our web-site it is not
true.

We are not asking for your trust or your undying belief.  We only ask that
you take us on OUR words and deeds, not on the misinterpretations of others.

We will soon be starting official meetings in Europe, the UK, and the US for
developers and dealers.  This will include introductory training seminars
for the new OS, and introductions to the retail pricing and schedules.  We
will also begin the process of introducing the new web-site, and putting the
Amiga Advisory Council to work.

I want to thank each and every one of you for your hospitality during our
meetings and for your continued support as we move forwards.  We have had
the chance to meet with many end users, developers, dealers, and new
partners, and look forward to meeting even more of you as time goes on.

There is a great deal of activity, with a lot of first footsteps on some
truly amazing paths.  New partners excited, old faces returning, familiar
faces reminding us of our heritage.  Indeed we are already having to move
into bigger facilities, such is our rate of growth.

I know it can be frustrating but after years wandering lost in a dark place,
the sun is finally starting to crack a smile on the horizon.  Together, we
will march into tomorrow.

Keeping the faith,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Happy New Millennium, how are you all?  Recovered from the Christmas/New
Year hang-overs?  I got a new PC for Christmas (Booooo, Hisssss, from the
background).  I needed it for work OK!!!  Right, well I've got a kinda weird
mix of stuff for you this Issue, considering I did a search for Hip-Hop and
this is the stuff I ended up with.  I promise you however that there are two
corking tunes in there for you to pick up from AMINET, and you won't be
disappointed :)))

                                  @{u}Scoring@{uu}

The overall rating of the Music Module is out of 10.  This rating is
governed by a few factors, these being - Commercial Viability: This is
whether I and some of my Music Industry contacts think it could be vinyl
worthy.  Style & Groove: This is whether the Music Module actually has taste
and style, be it "Of The Moment" or not, and Sampling & Timing:  This is the
most important, if it ain't in tune or out of time then you've failed!!!

All the Music Modules reviewed have been played through a Stereo, to give
maximum effect and I suggest you do the same!!!

Cheers all...enjoy!!!

Hmmm, starting off with something I'm going to rip to bits right away this
month.  I'm just completely annoyed at the description people give of a MOD
and it's not even worth the Download.  Computer Game Music is something I'd
rather listen to during a Computer Game and not part of my Music Collection.
It does, however have a funky groove to it and if it wasn't for the all too
familiar synth that tends to be used in Demos and Computer Game Music then
it would be OK.  Besides that I hope I don't get any more of these.

This is a kinda weird one.  The samples are totally having a laugh.  I like
this guy's style.  I hope he's done some serious stuff because the use of
samples and the timing is pretty tidy.  Just a pity I'm a sucker for flam
grooves which is the beat this entire MOD is based on, apart from the odd
reggae/ska thing which makes the whole thing sound happy.  Check it out if
you want a laugh, it's just crazy.

WOW!!!  What a breath of fresh air.  I thought it was going to be a very
flat month.  Do you want a very pleasant Hip-Hop MOD?  Well here's your
ticket.  It's a sort of cross between Sting and some Easy Listening Hip-Hop
tune.  It would be a classic if it had someone like 'Puff Daddy' singing on
it.  What was the one?  Every breath you take?  Well that's what this is
like.  If it wasn't for the lack of vocals it would be fine except that it
does get a bit repetative.  Definetly Downloadable.

Remember "Around The World" by Daft Punk.  Well this could have been along
those lines if Amiga Music Programmers never insisted on putting in the most
annoying samples imaginable.  What is the problem here?  One minute I get
minimalist toss, then next minute people don't know when to leave something
out.  Here's the solution to this MOD, load it into ProTracker or OctaMED
and ommit the Piano line and basically whatever annoys you, then save it out
again and you've got a pretty good MOD.

I hope this guy's done more of this stuff, but concentrates on his timing a
bit more.  The idea is completely there, and you can groove to parts of it,
but he's missed the all crucial timing bit.  Sampling is fine and they all
work together, and you can hear where it's coming from.  At last, someone
who (luckily, possibly) might know the right level of instrumentation to put
into or leave out of a MOD.

At last!!!  This is pretty good besides the fact that it seems to be Hip-Hop
crossed with reggae!!!  Anyway, this guy's made a real attempt at getting a
little groove going and I can't really complain after all the crap I've
heard today.  Check this one out if your going to write a Hip-Hop tune and
need some idea of what you can do with the AMIGA.  All the samples are fine
and a few nice vocal ones in saying that.  Check it out!!!

Everybody has got to get this MOD NOW!!!  This exceeds my expectations of
everything I have thought about AMIGA produced music.  You want funk - this
has got it.  You want Chemical Brothers - this has got it.  I can't stress
how funky this is, every groove, loop and sample is timed and mixed to
perfection.  It's another one of those ones, where I'd love to get the guy
in a real studio and let him loose with an AKAI S1000.  If you don't like
this, I really don't know what you'll like.  This has it all, please check

OK kiddies this one gets an OVER 18s only, so no listening to the lyrics
please.  Right, everyone knows I'm a Celsius fan by now but this definetly
surpasses it.  Every sample is carefully timed especially for the vocal
samples.  Absolutley astounding.  I'm shocked by this quite simply and I
can't believe it's been done on an AMIGA.  I just feel sorry for all those
reviews that I'm gonna write from now on that have to live up to this one.
Anyway the timing is perfect and the mix is superb by any standards, though
I recomend turning yer bass UP!!!  Hehehehe, Hahahaha :)))

Oy! Mark! NO! - Prince went out way before 1999.  Never mind partying like
it's 1999, maybe AMINET should've deleted this one before then.  Well I take
it Mark has attempted a few more tunes since this one came out, and I hope,
sincerley that he's got out of the Prince thing, or the artist formally
known as, or is Symbol.  Anyway, I was drifting, well this one's absolutely
terrible but if you want a laugh at an attempt at a Prince tune, then get it.
Or alternatively get a rip of the rumble voice sample which is the best bit
of the tune.

   @{u}Zeus BBS Software - By Neil Williams (SysOp Of The Killing Ground BBS)@{uu}

Allow me to introduce Zeus Developments.  Our main product is the Zeus BBS
package, and that's what I want to talk about (which is a good idea, since
this is a BBS Magazine after all).  If this turns out as more of an Advert
than an Article, SORRY!  But read it anyway, hey?

Zeus started life in 1992, born out of a need for something different in the
BBS World.  Nothing out there looked or felt like an AMIGA program - it was
all MS-DOS monsters or AMIGA OS 1.3 throw-backs.

So, two AMIGA SysOps got together and started work on Zeus, which went
through extreme programs of coding and testing over four years, until it's
final commercial release in 1996 at the World Of Amiga Show in London.  At
this time Zeus won many awards, and gained top scores in reviews in
prestigious Magazines such as AMIGA REPORT and CU AMIGA.

Sadly, after four and a half years of producing Zeus updates at a minimum
rate of seven a week, the original Authors stopped work and became all but
uncontactable.  After (literally) years of attempts, Zeus was finally bought
out by a group of three dedicated SysOps in April 1999.  The already
world-beating package has just got better.

Firstly, of course, we ensured Year 2000 compliance.  There were minor
issues with this, mainly in places where two digit dates are input, but now
Zeus is almost guaranteed to be fully operational through the Year 2000.

Next, we went for the bugs and feature requests which have piled up since
1996.  Yes, there were a few.  The bugs, in general were easy to squash
when you consider how big Zeus is.  Zeus is a very modular system, so
finding any errors is fairly easy even if there is 50MB of source to go
through.  Adding new features will always take time, especially if you also
take time to properly beta test each new thing added (well, there's some
time cut ;).  Internet support for TelNet BBSing is very important now and
we are working towards this steadily.  You can of course use the freely
available TNServ or Shareware TelSer with Zeus with excellent results.

While nothing hugely major has taken place between Zeus 1.1 and 1.3, we are
planning on an all-out powerful Zeus 2 for some date in the future.  This is
being kept under wraps at the moment.  I suppose I should reassure potential
buyers that Zeus 2 will be a very cheap upgrade for Zeus 1 owners (perhaps
even free to all long time Users, but this isn't definite and is not legally
binding, so ha!).

Perhaps instead of talking on and on like this, I should let you know some
of the features packed into Zeus.  I'm using and commenting on our ZeusInfo5
pack, which should be available on BBSes, AMINET and our Web-Page quite
soon.  For more detailed information, please see this pack!

Zeus is compatible with any AMIGA running OS 2.04 or higher which has more
than 2MB of memory.  Zeus requires ARexx, which is supplied with all AMIGA
OS versions since 2.04.  Zeus will take advantage of newer AMIGA OS features
without sacrificing compatibility.

Zeus tries to combine flexibility with ease of use.  It is configured using
a plethora of GadTools GUI programs.  The I/O between the user and the BBS
is controlled using a "ScriptSet" and menu screens, utilising Zeus' command
set of several hundred functions and the special ControlCodes for any
displayed text.

Our main claim is that Zeus can perfectly emulate any other Bulletin Board
in existence, a bit like its namesake.  So, lets have a look at the feature
list and talk about what each feature means.

@{u}BBS Features@{uu}

- Fully ARexx driven:
   - All menus are rexx scripts and are therefore totally configurable
   - Optional global command system
   - Could even be used to run a system exactly like CompuServe!

This basically is what the whole thing is about.  Zeus can take any form
you choose.

- No Hardcoded text:
   - Every single character in Zeus is configurable!
   - Auto ANSI code removal and 8 bit translation

Not only does Zeus allow you to change all the text shown to Users, it also
has features for providing compatibility with whatever terminal or
preferences those Users have.  As above, Zeus can automatically convert ANSI
to plain ASCII (no need for you to define two menu sets to do this) and also
will convert 8 bit ANSI graphic to ASCII - i.e. it will automatically
convert the IBM style character graphics to something viewable without an
IBM font!

- Powerful 'Watcher' system:

Zeus' concept of a 'Watcher' is separate from each line node.  In other BBS
programs, you might have the ANSI Watcher built into the node program, and
you might have to run the node program for each line you have.  Not so with
Zeus.  The Watcher for each line is separate, allowing you to either not
have a Watcher loaded (saving memory when you don't need to communicate with
the User) or even have more than one Watcher loaded.

   - 20 Function Key slots for running external programs or inserting text
   - Data screen shows useful BBS information:
      - Number of Users
      - Number of Calls today (and total Calls)
      - Number of Files/Messages online
      - Graph showing all-time and session Calls statistics
   - ANSI Watcher:
      - Ultra fast 2-16 colour ANSI display
      - Supports AMIGA codes
      - Optional pre-scroll 'jumpy' mode for faster scrolling.

The standard Watcher used by Zeus is the powerful and extremely fast ANSI
Watcher.  It supports all ANSI control codes, even down to ANSI music!

   - RIP Watcher:
      - HiRes 16 colour vectorised graphics display
      - Local RIP terminal

RIP is the standard for BBS graphics, showing Users vector and bitmapped
Graphical User Interfaces along with the normal ANSI displays.

   - CON Watcher
      - Open a shell-like Watcher window on any public screen

A simple CON Watcher, like that used by some other BBS programs.  Although
having some of the limits of a CON display (poor ANSI capability) it is
capable of being opened as a window on Workbench or Zeus' Control screen
(discussed later).

- IEMSI Support:
   - Allows Users to login instantly

A powerful addition supported by some terminal packages on the AMIGA and
many on the PC.  When the User calls the BBS, their terminal package will
communicate with Zeus and automatically log them on, and even set their
preferences.

- ANSI Music Support:

As mentioned above, Zeus even has native support for ANSI music!  Yes, such
a thing exists - maybe it's not pretty but it's fine for little jingles
after uploading or something similar.

- Optional Control screen:
   - Configurable menus for starting BBS related programs (GUI Editor)
   - Screen settings:
      - Any resolution
      - 2-256 editable colours
      - Any font
      - Supports IFF backdrops
   - Zeus programs can put 'icons' on the Control screen
      - Example 'ChatStatus' program graphically shows whether the SysOp is
        available for paging or not.  Just click to change!
   - The Control screen is public so you can set other programs to open
     their windows on it - e.g. TrapDoor.
   - Control can also be reduced from a screen to a window on Workbench,
     saving memory and still giving full BBS control and information
   - Control can be iconified onto Workbench at any time

The Control screen is how you as a SysOp communicate with Zeus.  It is like
a Dock and Workbench mixed together - you can put icons and menus on the
screen/window and use these to launch Zeus programs, edit the BBS, launch
automated tasks, etc, and also it is somewhere where Zeus programs iconify
themselves to.

@{u}Text System@{uu}

- Supports 256 menu sets and 256 languages
- Possible 66050 filename combinations for EACH text file
- GUI Menu Set and Language editors
- Optional text buffering system
   - Definable number of files to keep in memory
   - Optional file length limit

The text is the pre-made screens shown to your Users.  Zeus (as mentioned
above) can filter them based on your User's preferences.  Texts can also
contain control codes - Zeus' special character combinations which are
replaced by special texts.  We'll discuss these later.  Zeus also has a text
buffering system!  If you run a busy BBS, with many languages and menu sets,
it will be far better if Zeus could show menus and texts which are required
often from memory, rather than getting them from disk each time.  This is
what the buffering system does.

@{u}BBS Nodes@{uu}

- Unlimited amount of nodes

Really, Zeus can support any number of nodes you wish to set up!  And, with
Zeus' library concept, each node can take less than 10KB each - a far cry
from those BBS packages which require you to run another copy for each node!

- GUI Node setup program
- Serial options:
   - Supports any serial device/unit
   - Baud rates from 110-292000
   - Carrier, DSR and Rad-Boogie (the high speed mode) can be
     enabled/disabled
   - Full control over parity, char length, handshaking, stop bits
   - Can also be configured to accept TelNet connections
   - Floating baud rates supported

Zeus is fully compatible with all serial devices.  Whatever you wish to
connect Zeus to, it'll work.

- Nodes can be started from any 'front end' software or from the supplied
  Connector, ZMailer, TelNet or other provided 'front end' utilities.

Zeus includes a full and complete FidoNet mailer!  This highly featured
program is also very low maintenance - once set up, it'll work for as long
as it's needed.  The mailer uses a standard TrapList compiled NodeList, so
exisiting installations can be used in Zeus.

- Each line can have restrictions placed on it seperately, allowing you to
  define the times Users can get on with parameters including:
   - Minimum and maximum access of Users to let on
   - Minimum and maximum baud rates to allow use of the BBS
   - Disable logons (only allow FidoNet or SysOps Callers)
   - Go mail only (don't let users get past the FidoNet mailer)
   - No Answer!  With this, you can run a part-time BBS with ease, as you
     define when Zeus is allowed to answer the 'phone - no more having to
     put the BBS on/offline manually!

This is a very nice, very powerful feature of Zeus.  It is beyond what many
other BBS packages are capable of.

@{u}User Specifications@{uu}

- Unlimited number of Users
- Each User has their own directory

As each User has their own directory, it can be used to keep Files waiting
for them, to place QWK and BlueWave packets, for them to use themselves to
backup important data even!

- Fast User list scanning:
   - Alphabetical or Chronological
   - Forwards or Backwards
- GUI User Editor

As with most Zeus components, the SysOp has a full graphical interface to
manage Users with.

- Banned User support with full AMIGA DOS wildcards

Using this, not only specific Users can be banned, but by using wildcards
you can ban offensive names that you don't want on the BBS before the User
even gets past the login prompt!

- UserManager program:
   - Delete Users (with AMIGA DOS wildcard support)
   - Strip Users (who haven't called in 'x' amount of days)
   - UnDelete Users
   - Rebuild and Optimise User file

Like so much of Zeus, the User database can be managed automatically. Just
stick what you want in a Cron utility (one is provided) and it'll be run
every day, every month, every 12 minutes, whatever you want.

- BootUser utility chucks Users offline

Where would we be without this? :-)

@{u}Bulletins@{uu}

- 'RealTime' GUI Bulletin Editor
- Minimum/Maximum access
- Bulletins can be set to expire at a certain date/time

A strong feature in Zeus, Bulletins can not only be used for SysOp notices
(since Zeus can tell a User at logon if any have been updated) but also
for statistics or other automatically generated texts.  The expiry feature
also contributes to Zeus' low maintenance requirements.

- CLI Bulletin Manger:
   - Add/Remove bulletins
   - Update bulletins which have been changed recently
   - Set expiry infomation

Of course, the tool for use from the CLI or automatically keeping the
bulletins up to date.

@{u}Message Specifications@{uu}

Every message area in Zeus is assigned to an 'mb' library.  An 'mb'
(message base) library defines the low-level functions that manipulate
the messages as they are stored on disk.  Each area can be assigned a
different 'mb' library, or every area to the same one.

This means that various formats of messages can be accessed by Zeus
completely transparently, allowing foreign programs to maintain or use the
message base (or specific areas within) as well as Zeus, even a PC, Mac or
Linux box working over a network can now access the same message areas as
Zeus!

Currently available message libraries are:

   - mbzeus.library     - an extremely fast indexed message system.
   - mbstarmsg.library  - standard FTSC-1 message system (as used
                          with TrapToss and Foozle).
   - mbuunews.library   - RNEWS format UseNet news.

- Zeus Internal FTS Mail Processor

Zeus comes with a full and complete FidoNet mail processor.  It is fully
featured, and is something which if not shipped with Zeus would certainly
be an expensive package to buy in it's own right!

The program is known as "ZMP" - the Zeus Mail Processor.

   - 5-dimensional operation

Sees addresses as "2:442/107.0@fidonet", but you can also use "2:442/107.0"
if you want.

   - Superlative Import speeds

ZMP is fast.  Take the whole FidoNet backbone of several megabytes a day
with ease, export it to a hundred downlinks just as quick.

   - Auto-area creation

Create an area straight into the BBS, or have it skip the BBS and just
passed through to downlinks.  Or even disable auto-creation of areas.

   - Built-in AreaFix support
     - Uplink support
     - Full control

If you've ever used a BBS package with no AreaFix support, this will be a
god send.  It's a fully featured AreaFix robot - your Users need never
bother you about fixing in or out of areas, they can talk to the AreaFix
robot and do it themselves.

   - Pass-through areas.

Don't want an area on your BBS, but do want to pass it on to points or
other downlinks?  Set it as passthough.  Easy.

   - Echomail file attach support.

Zeus even supports the odd practise of attaching files in echomail areas!

   - Fully-featuring routing system

Wildcard capable routing ensures your Netmails go where they're supposed
to.  Run a small BBS with one routing line, or a World HUB with a hundred -
doesn't matter, Zeus can handle it.

   - Automatic Archive/Packet type switching on detection.

What if a downlink can't support the advanced archiver or packet type you're
sending them?  Well, the message they send to complain will automatically
switch Zeus into a compatible format for them!  If they send ZIP, so does
Zeus.  If they switch one day from LHA to LZX, Zeus switches with them, no
questions asked.  Of course, this can be turned off for each linked node
individually if needed.

   - FTS-1 (2D), 39 (4D), 48 (4D) and 45 (5D) packet import/export support.

All ratified FidoNet standard types of message packet are supported, even
the two separate 4D standards, ensuring compatibility with every other
system out there.

   - Inbuilt Tick Processor and Hatcher

A Tick system is also built into ZMP, which ties into the Zeus File
sub-system and is capable of auto-creating new tick echoes, tying them into
a BBS file area.

   - Name->Address Remapper

Do people keep spelling your name wrong?  Set up a few different spelling
in the Remapper and Zeus will catch them and send them to you properly.

Or, have you or another User moved address?  From the BBS to a point
perhaps?  Set them up here and Netmails will always find their target.

   - Area flow statistics
      - Keep data on number and size of messages passing per week
      - Supplied program to configurably output this data, e.g. for posting
        in areas/networks

Zeus keeps tabs on the messages passing through each networked area.  Want

`--------------------------------------------------------------------------'

   - Messages addressed to certain names can be bounced, remapped, or acted
     upon by a program or script which is launched as soon as a message
     with that name is imported.  Optionally protect these with passwords 
     provided in the subject line, like an AreaFix robot.

- Fully functional news and email gating system
   - Zeus features superlative gating abilities

Zeus takes the Internet and makes it a part of your BBS.  E-Mail and
Newsgroups can be taken and completely transparently integrated with your
BBS.  While other BBS packages might be flooding FidoNet with messages
addressed to "ALL", Zeus reverses the trend and can take Internet messages
and put the correct To: name in them!  This is unique to Zeus in the whole
BBS World!

   - Dupe detection
   - Reply linking
   - Message Bouncing
   - Extremely quick index format

All features provided by Zeus' gateway program, ZGate, which is so
integrated with Zeus the distinction of a gateway is lost.  This program
allows all your downlinks (or rather, those you give access to) to also use
your Internet gate, giving them (your points, or other nodes) E-Mail
addresses, access to mailing lists, newsgroups, whatever you want to
provide.

   - Support for Dynamic IP Internet accounts

You don't need a static Internet account, but it helps.

   - Map To: fields, give newsgroups and mailing list messages To: names!
   - Map the user name before the @ sign to whatever you want for each
     user, or leave each user with the default Internet addresses of their
     name and alias.
   - AMINET mirroring to your file base!

Take all or part of the new files uploaded to AMINET.  The intelligent
'mirroring' program replaces older versions of archives on your BBS and
takes down the directories of AMINET you choose, perhaps if you wish also
limiting the size of files which will be downloaded.

- Unlimited number of message areas
   - Fields include for each message area -
      - Low and High Accesses,
      - Gender required to access area
      - Minimum age to access area
      - Usenet moderated group follow-up base

Configure access to areas individually, as well as being able to define for
each User individually and also through templates (described later).

   - Message Base type
      - Local
      - Echomail
      - Netmail
      - UUCP
      - UUCP Mail

An area can act differently depending on its type.

   - Message Base Storage type
      - Standard Zeus format
      - StarMsg (#.msg) format
      - NNTP network format
      - Tin format
      - Elm Mail format

As described above when we talked about the Message Base libraries.

   - Flags -
      - Private Base
        (All Messages are automatically made Private)
      - Aliases (Aliases are then used by default)
      - Hi-ASCII Stripping
      - Allow Users to Delete Own Written Messages
      - Allowing Quoting in Base or not
      - And more!

As well as areas acting differently depending on their type, you can set
flags for each area which can control certain vital parts of their
operation.

   - Processor for each written message allowing -
      - Jive, Kraut & Valley Girl (amongst others) message translators!
      - Anything plug-in you want to modify written messages

This fabulous feature lets you define a program which is run on messages
posted to certain areas (the 'executable processor' can be assigned to one
or more areas easily).  Imagine a user posting to an area in English, but
as soon as they save the message it is translated to French by an
automatic script!  This is possible!

- Unlimited number of External Message Editors
   - Line Editor supplied
   - Full Screen Editor supplied
   - Local Users may use Local Editors (e.g. CygnusEd, GoldEd)

SysOps may use the text editor they are most comfortable with.  No more
struggling with those terrible line editors, when you can use GoldEd!

- Waiting Mail support

Waiting mail for each User is stored in a quick access index, ensuring that
Zeus never needs to scan the whole message base to look for new messages
addressed to a User (unlike some BBS packages!).  Zeus can store millions of
messages easily, so it is important that messages for a User are found
quickly and easily.  A User of a Zeus BBS can also 'unsubscribe' an area,
meaning that they will not be notified of personal messages in that area
again, although they can go back and read them if they wish.

- Forward and Reverse Reply Linking

Follow threads easily.  Zeus can also group messages by subject!

- Anonymous Sender and Recipient Fields
- Message Display system -
   - Configurable Coloured Quote lines
   - Configurable Coloured or Hideable Kludges, Seen-Bys, Paths
   - Supports *emphasis* /like/ #this#!

Ever been bored staring at a very plain display while reading messages?  No
more!  Not only can Zeus colour specific parts of messages, like the quoted
lines, it also supports the standard *bold* /italic/ and _underline_
emphasis markers, as well as some #more# special ones.

- Message Signature Support

Users can add signatures to messages, and not only that, they can have a
different signature for each network or Special Interest Group ("SIG", see
later!).

- Message Searching System by -
   - Sub-string within Text,
   - Exact or Sub-string within From, To and Subject fields

A complete break away from what you'd expect from a normal BBS, Zeus can
even search for messages based on the parameters you give!

- Stored High Pointers for each User
- Fully Intuition-Based GUI Configuration Utilities for every
  aspect of the powerful Message Configurations
   - Message Area Editor
   - Message Display Colour Editor
   - Network Configuration
      - FidoNet Addressing
      - FidoNet Export/Import Systems
      - FidoNet Netmail Routing
   - Message/File/Signature Editor Configuration Program
- Graphical Display of Current Message Statistics (include High,
  Low and High Sent By Net pointers)
- Full Logging to Screen and Disk
- QWK/Bluewave offline packer system

Yes, of course - Zeus has a QWK and Bluewave (combined) offline packer
system.  It also support text formats for offline reading like MBBS.

@{u}The File Sub-System@{uu}

The file system is controlled by file base libraries, just like the message
base libraries.  Only one is available at present, but this offers fast
access times and a fully Chrono/Alpha indexed file system.

@{u}File Specifications@{uu}

- Unlimited number of file areas
   - Fields include -
      - Low and High Accesses required
      - Minimum BPS rate to download and upload
      - The Minimum Age required
      - Files require validation
      - And more!

Like message areas, each file area can be set individually, per user or via
Templates.

   - Areas can be made to use 8.3 MS-DOS filenames only

An excellent feature for PC file areas, this restricts file names to
xxxxxxxx.xxx format - for the MS-DOS system.  Even if someone tries to
upload a longer filename, Zeus will intelligently cut it down to 8.3 size!

- Multiple Area Path Support
   - Each area can be extended transparently over as many
     hard disks, CD-ROMs, or even network connections you have.

I cannot emphasise how important a feature this can be.  The Multi-Paths (as
they are known) allow you to do such magic as having /each/ /area/ of your
file base over several hard disks and CD-ROMs, and as each hard disk fills
up Zeus automatically (with no outside intervention) starts using a hard
disk with enough space on.  In this way, you can extend your file base over
many disks completely transparently, and very easily.  Another thought:
while the AMIGA OS 3.5 and better support partitions larger than 4GB, some
older programs do not.  What if you have more than 4GB of files?  Zeus will
let you essentially treat two or more file partitions as one, so problem
solved!

- Transfer Sub-System
   - Supports the HYDRA bi-directional file transfer and chat
     mode protocol.
   - Supports enhanced XPR 2.001 libraries such as Dmodem
   - Supports standard XPR libraries, including -
      - Zmodem Batch
      - Zmodem-8k
      - ZedZap
      - Ymodem
      - Xmodem
      - and most others you can find!
   - Supports external transfer programs such as SModem too!
   - Files can be checked for duplication before upload
   - File Report Statistics can easily be obtained through Rexx

A powerful, standard file transfer system.

- Number of files limited only by disk-space
- Index files work equally well with a large or small file base
- Very fast scanning system

Zeus' indexed file base ensures that no matter how many files you have,
they can be found on disk in a fraction of a second.  No waiting while the
BBS slowly looks through each record one by one.

- Scans can be based upon -
   - Chronology
   - Alphabetically
   - Globally
   - By Date order
- All Scans can be performed both forwards and backwards
- Very quick index base format which protects against disk
  fragmentation by storing the file descriptions in just a few,
  sorted indexes
- CD-ROM/Slow Device pre-copy supported
- Signal access means that multidisk-disk CD-ROM players are
  never left changing back and forth over disks, but copy a file
  at a time
- Each file has a unique index number for quick retrieval
- Rebuild/Optimise Utility supplied to keep index files trimmed
  and working efficiently
- Informative File Structure includes -
   - Index Number
   - File Name
   - File Size
   - Upload Date
   - Last Download Date
   - Number Of Downloads file has had
   - Name of User who Uploaded the file
- Flags include
   - Unvalidated File
   - Free File (no impact on credit ratios)
   - Temporarily deleted file
   - Off-line file: for when access to the disk that holds is
     unavailable (think CD-ROM!)
   - and more!
- File Description can be of unlimited length, to include all
  relevant information about each file

Notably, file descriptions are not limited as in other BBS packages.  You
may choose to limit them yourself as SysOp, of you may decide that 44
characters across and 6 lines down isn't enough.

- Users may insert their own comments about each file
- New Uploaded files, through Rexx, can be
   - Checked for viruses with almost any virus checker available
   - Stripped of BBS adverts
   - Stripped of unwanted files
   - and BBS adverts may be added to archive
- Marking Files
   - Unlimited number of marked files, or limited by the SysOp
     to stop users marking the whole file base
   - Marked files can be added in ranges such as '#-#',
     '#,#,#-#'
   - AMIGA DOS wildcards supported when marking files
     'ZEUS#?.?HA'
   - User can delete, using ranges, currently marked files
- Credit System
   - File Ratio
   - Byte Ratio
   - Max Bytes per Day
   - Max Files per Day

Some of the more powerful features of Zeus interact with the File, Msg
and Main BBS Server.

- A Powerful User Template System.  Each Template can be attached
  to a different access level, and set to the default settings by
  the GUI User Editor.  However, each User may have different
  template accesses to the defaults, and these can be changed by

  to support
   - Recognition strings - Allow archive types to be detected
     without the use of a three letter postfix
   - Pack, unpack and test strings
   - Support for most known archivers, even encoders such as
     uuencode can be defined

@{u}Doors@{uu}

- Zeus supports many different door emulation libraries.

  - Paragon Door support.
  - DLG Door support via an emulation library.
  - Xenolink Door support via an emulation library.
  - MAX's BBS.
  - AmiExpress (/X) doors which do not rely on fixed /X data files.

- ABBEREXX Door Support.
  This system also includes support for:

  - CNet Rexx
  - XenoLink Rexx

  features provided by Zeus.

- Zeus ARexx doors.  Based on our ScriptSet mechanism, you can use doors
  written for the Zeus ARexx command set.  ARexx doors once got a 'bad
  press', but this we can guarantee is due to inferior ARexx ports in other
  systems!

@{u}Zeus Asyncronous Packet Protocol@{uu}

*ZAPP*

Eh? Whats that then?

It's the future of BBSes that's what it is!  You won't find it in any other
more feeble BBS Software and it's damned exciting stuff.  All you need do is
log onto the BBS as per normal using a provided Zapp.device.  When you
arrive all is as normal.  So what's the fuss all about?

Quick flick onto Workbench reveals, an Icon, yes an Icon.  You gently caress
your mouse button and open the icon.  Inside, lying like an opened clam is
the BBS File area.  Drag and Drop, Transfer via DOpus, yes it's all there.
Confused, I bet you are.  So you copy a file in DOpus, like a 5 MB
Animation.  So what do you do now then.  On more feeble software you go an
have your tea that's what you do.

So you idly flick back to the TERM or NCOMM screen to watch the transfer
window telling you theres another 20 mins of transfer to go.  Eh?  There's
no transfer screen.  You click a key, the BBS responds!  You click another
and enter the games menu.  Who turned that radio on, you shout to your
girlfriend?  Hang on a minute, the sound came from your speakers.  No, it's
the Jack Daniels taking effect.  Surely not?  You press another key, another
sound comes from your speakers.  It's Bugs Bunny saying 'Whats Up Doc'.

Brain is going into overload, you now have a new Device on WB and aural
stimulii coming through your speakers.  This cannot be happening.  It can't
be true?

Your girlfriend wanders in the room.  She is semi-naked and gives you that
look.  She wanders away into your bedroom and you know what she wants.
Stuff that you think, I can do that tomorrow!  She slams the door, never
mind.

Warily you start a game of Hyper Typer.  The game commences and so you
check the modem lights.  The file transfer is still happening.  You flick
back to Workbench and suddenly a window appears.  'Hi There' is the title.
'Good Stuff This' is the body of the message.  'For Sure' is the name of the
button you have to press to make it go away.  Help!  Whats happening?

You have entered the world of Zapp.  You have experienced the future and
salvation of BBSes as we know them.

ZAPP also means you can serve HTML webpages from your BBS, and, soon, full
Internet access.

ZAPP is a fully featured packet networking system, which like all Zeus
features can be written for and expanded by any programmer through our
public APIs.

@{u}Developer Information@{uu}

While Zeus is fully programmable and totally configurable through ARexx,
we also supply just as much power to programmers who wish to use compiled
and assembled programming languages.

Zeus is supplied with many files to help developers.  We have two main Zeus
support libraries with over 230 BBS functions accessible for programmers.

Full autodocs are included to help developers create tools for Zeus.

Every aspect of the BBS can be controlled through these support libraries,
including full message and file base manipulation.

@{u}But There's More!!!@{uu}

The most important aspect of Zeus' operational abilities have not yet been
explored.  We have stated earlier that Zeus can emulate any BBS package, or
take any form you wish.

This is accomplished through the ARexx scripting system.

Here is an example main menu in Zeus:

/*
** MainMenu.zeus -- The main menu.
*/

Even if you are not an ARexx guru, I am sure you will appreciate the wide-
ranging possibilities for your BBS with such a flexible system.  Even if you
have not the slightest clue as to what to do with ARexx, don't fret - the
Zeus team are willing to do the work to write your menus for you, when they
have time - how's that for commitment?

Thanks for reading this far!  I'm sorry it went on for over six thousand
words, but I am still as enthusiastic about Zeus as I was years ago, more
so even!

Perhaps you'd like more information on Zeus now?  You can get more by
downloading the ZeusInfo4.lha information pack from the Zeus Developments
BBSes or from AMINET, or you can visit our Web-Site where you'll find
information on pricing and even a demo of Zeus (I keep finding myself
apologising for how very old the demo is, but as soon as I've sorted the
Zeus 1.3 release, I promise I'll update it!).

  @{u}CoNnEcTiOnS Quiz - By Dunkie (SysOp Of Quest BBS/Editor Of CoNnEcTiOnS)@{uu}

The @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Quiz was introduced a couple of Issues ago, and was well
received by @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers, to a certain point that is!!!  Despite the
favourable Corespondence, only ONE @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Reader has bothered to have a
go at entering the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Quiz, on both occassions.  In light of this,
I've spoken to the person in question, S.N.S (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Skull Monkey BBS" Link SkullMonkeyBBS}@{BG background}),
and we have both agreed that there doesn't seem to be any point in
continuing with the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Quiz at this present time, at least not
until @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers start to make a bigger effort in participating and
interacting with the Magazine :(((  So, for those of you who may have tried
to have a go at Last Issue's @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Quiz, but didn't submit any Answers,
then here are the Questions and Answers to Last Issue's @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Quiz:-

"I really liked the Last Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, it had good content and was 
nicely styled, and I would like to be added to the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Mailing List.
I particularly liked the Quiz Pages, I think they're great...well done!!!"

Stuart Betty (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Electron BBS" Link ElectronBBS}@{BG background})

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

Glad you liked the Last Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} m8, but I've some bad news for
you...the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Quiz has been axed from this Issue, due to the fact,
that like yourself, other @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers have praised the inclusion of
the Quiz Pages, but no-one has bothered to actually have a go at them and
send any Answers into @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, or @{BG fill}@{"Kerry-Oot BBS" Link KerryOotBBS}@{BG background}, which runs the other
Quiz Page in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} :(  So, although I gladly thank you for your kind
comments, I hope that the omission of the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Quiz will not spoil
your enjoyment of the Magazine.  One thing I can assure you however, is that
I've not ruled out the possibility of the @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Quiz returning :)))

"Would it be possible for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}' BBS Directory to be available as an
A-Z of BBSes, aswell as the current format?"

Paul Male (Halifax, West Yorkshire)

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

What a brilliant idea!!!  So good an idea, that I've implemented a *NEW*
A-Z Directory Of UK BBSes starting from this very Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, so
check it out m8, and let me know whether it is to your satisfaction or
not!!!  I've replaced ALL the *OLD* BBS Numbers with the *NEW* BBS Numbers
that come into force from April 22nd, to get @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers used to
the *NEW* BBS Numbers, because after April 22nd, the *OLD* BBS Numbers are
invalid.  Thanks again m8 for an excellent idea, and I hope the inclusion of
the A-Z makes @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} a better read, not only for you, but also for ALL
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers :)))

FluffyNet was a joint creation by Niki Murkett (Authour of MAX's Pro) and
Roger Wilco, to be a simple Echo Network for happy people :-)

There are 9 Mail Areas covering a wide range of topics including help with
any MAX's Pro related problems with people like Steve Clack (Author Of
MagicFile & SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Total Eclipse BBS" Link TotalEclipseBBS}@{BG background}) and Kryten (Author Of Life & SysOp
Of @{BG fill}@{"Kaleidoscope BBS" Link KaleidoscopeBBS}@{BG background}) willing to help with most subjects to do with Doors.

FluffyNet is simple to set up and any BBSes in the current Nodelist will be
able to help you set it up.  The FluffyNet starter pack is available from
most MAX's BBS Systems or from the AMINET (comms/bbs/maxs).

                       Online Echo Mail Distribution

POWERNET is a *NEW* up and coming Echo-Mailnet to hit your screens, with
JUST a few months of running, we have managed to persuade many people to
connect a feed.  This Mailnet has 9 Mail Sections, hopefully to cater for
ALL your mailing needs.

POWERNET was specifically designed to have an anything goes attitude, there
are NO Moderators stamping on your toes at every opportunity.

We also have a Web-Site to compliment POWERNET, designed by my Co-SysOp,
Co-Founder and Nodelist Co-Ordinator, Chris Biggs (SysOp Of Hellfire BBS).
The POWERNET Web-Site can be found at:-

http://www.power-net.freeserve.co.uk

OUR AIM is to offer as many feeds to POWERNET as possible, giving POWERNET
the chance to grow and prosper.  We are aiming to put POWERNET on the market
as THE PLACE to be and where ALL the ACTION is.

ALSO, FREE (Yes...I said FREE) Adverts of YOUR BBS on our POWERNET Web-Site.
This service will be of NO cost to you, all we ask is JOIN TODAY!!!

In addition to your BBS Advert being added to our POWERNET Web-Site, we
will also add a link to your Web-Site (If Applicable).  This Advert service
will add support to YOUR BBS and Web-Site...

     *-*-* POWERNET BBS ADVERTS ARE FREE TO ALL POWERNET MEMBERS *-*-*

Also @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is now supported by POWERNET and will be available from any
POWERNET outlet throughout the UK...

    Using Diamond Systems 56k Flex PCI Modem Technology for the fastest
                           possible connections.

          The ONLY 1 of 2 known DOS/ANSI BBS Systems in Sheffield.

   Friendly, helpful SysOp, loves to answer those PC tech questions! :-)

 2 CD's always online.  CD database being added to all the time.  SysOp is
               open-minded, and does not mind being directed.

 Loads of Online Games to dabble with including BBS Golf, Boggle, Checkers,
                      Blackjack Bowling and many more!

 Great ANSI's and colour.  Loads of Doors to try, being added all the time.

                         Adding PowerNet Mail soon.

        Electric Box BBS is 24 hours a Day and is open all the time.
          So come on and join one of Sheffield's great BBSes now!
                        BBS Number is: 0114 2257296

                          To log BBS if SysOp out:
               Dial for 60 secs, Hang up 60 secs, Dial again.

                          To log BBS if SysOp in:
          Dial attempt on the first go will get you onto the BBS.

NOTICE: If your Terminal times out Dial time on the first ring, simply keep 
        ringing and ringing and ringing until you are through.  The total
        Dial time will not last for more than 3 minutes.  If you are ringing
        for longer than this time with no answer, the system is down
        temporarily and is being worked at by the SysOp, call back later.
        This will not happen very often.

                           Why the long ringing?
                           ---------------------

The first time you ring, YOU switch on the power supply to my Computer! ;-)
The 60 second hang up, means you are waiting for my Computer to load the 
Host Software.  The 2nd time you Call, the Host Software will be loaded,
waiting for a Call, and you will get through.  Please note that my Computer
is fully disconnected from the mains power supply when you first Call, so no
matter for how long you ring, or how intermittent your ringing is, you will
not get through to this Computer until it has loaded it's operating system,
and then loaded the Host Software ready for a Call.

Naturally, when you log off this system, you switch off the power supply to
my Computer and it waits for another Call.  My Computer is controlled by a
Card of my own design and build (see more about it on the BBS).  Download
from the Public Download Menu a file called DESCATOC.DOC, there is a full
colour picture of the prototype Card in this file, as well as extensive
info on the Card itself.  The Card has many unique features, even holds
power if another Call incoming within 10 minutes of last Call!  See it for
yourself.
