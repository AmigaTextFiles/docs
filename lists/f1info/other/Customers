SOFTWARE PRICES@2
---------------@5
All PD disks are 80p per disk (not per title) please check to see that the
software you require is not a multi-disk title, if it is then you'll need
to include 80p for each disk.

In the section called @3OLDER STUFF@5 all the disks are just 50p each.
@4
We  also have a section called SPECIAL VALUE PACKS. The disks in there are
80p, but if you buy ten at the same time you pay only £6.00, not bad eh?
@3
All our licenceware, shareware, CD-ROMs, and commercial titles are clearly
priced individually. If a postage fee is also shown, it means that the
selected item carries an extra postage cost, please add the amount to the
standard postage fee (£1.00 UK) when ordering that item.
@5
Please note that any items returned to us without a #7return code@5 will not
be posted back to you unless you include the correct return postage.
