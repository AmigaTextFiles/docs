Enforcer        Enforcer uses the MMU to build a shroud of protection
                over anything that is not legal memory.  Any empty holes
                in the address space are marked as illegal.  Reads of
                the system ROMs are allowed, but not writes.  With the
                exception of longword reads of location 4, the lowest
                1K of memory is completely protected.  When an illegal
                access is detected, the power LED will flash and a
                detailed message will be sent out the serial port.

StillStore      A program designed for freelance, corporate, and broadcast
                television.  It loads and displays IFF images of any
                resolution interchangeably from a list file or as inputted
                directly (I.E. random access).  The user may easily skip
                forward or backward one or more pictures in the list.  A
                "generic" display is always just a few seconds away.  The
                program can be used "on air" with no concern that a pull
                down menu will suddenly appear in the viewable area.  It
                also provides for a precise cue for changing windows or
                screens.  While the main purpose is to load "news windows"
                of 1/4 screen size, StillStore can also handle full-sized
                and overscanned images.  Also includes slide show modes and
                a screen positioning feature.  Stillstore is written in the
                Director language from the Right Answers Group. This is
                an update to version 1.2 on disk 317.

Vlt             VLT is both a VT100 emulator and a Tektronix (4014 plus
                subset of 4105) emulator, currently in use at SLAC
                (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center).  Although the VT100
                part was originally based on Dave Wecker et al.'s VT100,
                many enhancements were made.  Features include use of ARP,
                an ARexx port, XMODEM 1K/CRC and Kermit protocols, support
                for additional serial ports, external file transfer protocols
                (XPR), a "chat" mode, and scrollback/review/history buffer.
                It comes in two versions, one with Tektronix emulation, and
                one without.  The Tektronix emulation allows saving IFF files,
                PostScript files, and printing bitmaps to the printer.  This
                is an update to version 4.846 on disk 410.

FileWindow      A completely public domain file requester which may be used
                in any program, even commercial ones.  It uses dynamically
                allocated memory to hold the file names so the only limitation
                is the amount of memory available.  Includes a filter option
                to limit display of filenames to only ones with a specific
                extension.  Names are automatically sorted while they are
                being read and displayed.  This version has been enhanced
                by Bernd Schied for more device gadgets, renaming of files
                and directories, ANSI-C source, and more.  Update to version
                1.10 on disk 336.  Includes source.

                displayable).  Listing is displayed on a console window or
                optionally written to an output file.  Possible uses would
                be to scan files for binary characters, relative character
                counts, matching numbers of special characters, determining
                LF/CR configurations, etc.  
                Version 1.0, includes source.

                one for smaller and one for large internal storage (though
                both have software virtual memory if needed).  These
                images operate OK under AmigaDos 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0.
                They include code allowing the spreadsheet to be treated
                as a series of "pages" so that a cell has a row, column,
                and (optionally) page, and ranges can be in depth along
                pages as well as along rows or columns.  The mapping is
                flexible enough so that it can be used to facilitate
                computing traces of matrices if desired, as well as for
                more conventional use.  This is an update to version
                V24-01a on disk 328.
                Version V25-03B.  Includes source.

AvailMem        A small free memory counter that continuously displays the
                amount of (and size of the largest block of) free chip, fast,
                and total memory in bytes (as opposed to K).  This is a
                Workbench 2.0-compatible upgrade to version 1.03 on disk 285.
                Version 1.12.  Includes source.

DU              A Workbench 2.0-aware DU program.  Unlike other Amiga DU
                programs, it will skip over links to files and links to
                directories.  Not only does this give a more accurate
                representation of how much space the contents of a particular
                directory are taking up, it also prevents infinite loops when
                a directory has a link to one of it's ancestors.
                Version 1.02, includes source.

MemMometer      A program that opens a narrow window and graphically both
                displays your memory usage like a gauge, and also detects
                changes in regions of memory over time.  Detected changes
                are catagorized and displayed using color coded bands.  This
                ia an update to version 2.10 on disk 350.  It accomodates
                AmigaDOS 2.0 and the Amiga 3000 32-bit memory addresses.
                Version 2.20.  Includes source.

Ruler           Ruler is a small tool used in the measurement and con-
                strainment of text.  Originally conceived as a tool for
                insuring that filenames didn't exceed the Amiga's 30
                character limit, it is nevertheless useful in any sit-
                uation when the number of characters in a line of text
                needs to be counted.
                Version 5.00, includes source.

Back&Front      Sends a window to back or brings it to front with defined
                actions.  For example put a window in front by double-
                clicking in it and send it back with the middle mouse button.
                Any keyboard or mouse event can be trapped.  Number of
                required actions can be changed (double-click vs triple-
                click).  Implemented as a commodity.  Requires AmigaOS 2.0.
                Version 1.03.  Includes german version and source.

ChangeColors    A new palette tool to change the colors of the workbench or
                any other public screen. The feature of this tool is its
                font independance; it uses the font of the screen on which
                it opens, instead of insisting on topaz 8.  Looks really great
                if you use any other font than topaz on your workbench screen.
                Version 1.03.  Includes german version.  Binary only.

FreeCopy        FreeCopy is unlike most copiers in that it does not actually
                copy disks.  It removes the protection so disks can easily
                be backed up with almost any program, and in some cases be
                installed on your hard drive.
