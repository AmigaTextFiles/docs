DDLI		The Duniho and Duniho Life Pattern Indicator (DDLI) is a 
		program that asks you questions in order to determine your 
		Life Pattern. The Life Patterns correspond to the sixteen 
		psychological types measured by the Myers-Briggs Type 
		Indicator (MBTI), and they are represented by the same 
		abbreviations. By using knowledge that Terence Duniho has 
		added to the study of Type, this program also checks itself
		by asking supplementary questions about other preferences 
		that correlate with a person's type. Author: Fergus Duniho

KingCON		A console-handler that optionally replaces the standard 
		'CON:' and 'RAW:' devices. It is 100% compatible, but adds 
		some VERY useful features, such as: Filename-completion

		the Amiga, but none of this program. The interpreter 
		supports v1, v2, v3 (Zork1 to Stationfall), v4 (Trinity, 
		Bureaucracy, etc.) and v5 (Sherlock, Beyond Zork etc.) 
		games. This is more than any other freely distributable 
		interpreter. With this interpreter you can play ALL the 
		games in the LTOI2 package for the IBM PC, by copying the 
		datafiles with Cross-DOS or similar, then just running this
		interpreter. Requires OS 2.0+. Binary only. Author: 
		InfoTaskForce, amiga port by David Kinder

PCal		Creates a very nice looking postscript calendar. By 
		default, PCal simply prints an empty calendar. Its real 
		power is in its ability to place ``events'' in appropriate 
		days on the calendar, thus allowing the user to create 
		personalized calendars. This is achieved through the use of
		a "calendar.dat" file that has extraordinary flexibility.

MouseAideDEMO	A DEMO version of a "Mouse" utility which has all the 
		standard functions: Acceleration with threshold, window and
		screen cycling by mouse and keyboard, mouse and screen 
		blanking, mouse and Auto-Activation, user "hot key" 
		command, Keyboard "String" macros, etc. But also has many

		Version 2.90, an update to version 2.30 on disk 802. Public
		domain, assembly source included. Author: Dan Babcock

SnoopLibs	A clever tool for developers and others with a more-
		thanusual interest in the functioning of tasks, to patch 
		and monitor any library-function-call from a certain task. 
		The output-formats can be changed and the results can be 
		printed to a window, a file or printer. Only for Kickstart 
		v37(+). Includes six ".sl" files (library data) and a tool 
		(fd2sl + source) to add more. Comes with an AmigaGuide 
		manual. This is version 0.9, first public release. Author: 
		ASWare, by Ekke Verheul & Dirk Reisig

StartWindow	Configurable WorkBench "launch-program" type utility. Opens
		a zipwindow that when activated, presents the user with a 
		listwindow of pre-configured commands. Ideal for those 
		commands used infrequently enough that you don't want a 
		dock-icon cluttering up your WorkBench for. Includes source
		for both English and German versions. Author: Heinz Reinert

SuperDuper	An exciting, high-speed disk copier and formatter. Typical 
		timings are 99s for a disk-to-disk verified copy, or 38s 
		for a four disk non-verified format. Also available are 
		buffering in RAM, on a hard disk image file or on any 
		sectorbased Amiga device, like RAD:, VDO:, FMS:, etc. Real-
		time compression using the Xpk standard allows to copy in 
		one pass most disks on 1M Amigas, especially in conjunction
		with a special utility which "hides" external drives to the
		system (but not to SuperDuper). Bells and whistles include 
		high density floppy support, voice, automatic date 
		increment, a list of the disks copied, and automatic start 
		of operations based on disk insertion/ejection sensing. 
		Works on any Amiga under 2.0 and beyond. The changes from 
		version 3.0 are mainly bug fixes and some new features, 
		namely optional simple refresh windows, the new NoStartup 
		switch, automatic source disk reads, and better window 
		management. Version 3.1, an update to version 3.0 on disk 
		number 903. Binary only, freeware. Author: Sebastiano Vigna

APipe		The `APipe-Handler' allows you to add the `APIPE:' DOS 
		device to your system. This device acts as a pipe between 
		two programs, but in a different manner than the standard 
		`PIPE:' device does. This handler interprets the text after
		the `APIPE:' prefix as a command line to execute, and the 
		process/command which opens the file indicated by the 
		mention of `APIPE:' can now read the standard output or 
		write the standard input of the program indicated by the 
		command line depending on whether the `APIPE:' file was 
		opened for reading or writing, respectively. Thus, the 
		opening an `APIPE:' file is analogous to the UNIX `popen()'
		call, but it is more widely available to the user. Complete
		source is included and can be used as an example of a 
		handler. Version 37.5, an update to version 37.4 on disk 
		number 783. Author: Per Bojsen

HWGRCS		A 3 part distribution of an RCS 5.6.0.1 port to the Amiga, 
		currently at patch level 8. Part 1 contains the binaries 
		and documentation in AmigaGuide and "man" format, part 2 
		contains the source code to RCS, and part 3 contains the 
		source code and binaries for patch and diffutils. The 
		Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of
		text files. RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging, 
		identification, and merging of revisions. RCS is useful for
		text that is revised frequently, for example: programs, 
		documentation, graphics, papers, form letters, etc. 
		Included are RCS 5.6, GNU diffutils 2.6 and an LP utility 
		to support paged diff outputs. Part 1 on disk 980, part 2 
		is on disk 981, and part 3 is on disk 982. Author: Walter

ConPaste	ConPaste is a 2.0 commodity that allows you to paste 
		clipped text into anything. Paste into string gadgets. 
		Paste into any text application. In this new version, 
		ConPaste drops its priority by 1 when pasting text to allow
		sufficient processor time for the receiving task or window 
		to process the text. When you press a user-defined key or 
		key combination, ConPaste will take any FTXT found in 
		clipboard unit 0, convert the text back into input events, 
		and send the input events into the input stream. The output
		will go to the active window or string gadget. This is 
		version 37.25, an update to the version distributed with 
		ClipWindow by Jim Harvey, on disk 935. Author: Carolyn 
		Scheppner

HuntWindows	Starting with 2.0 you can make screens bigger than the 
		visual size of your monitor. On a double-size workbench, 
		catching windows like requesters etc. can be quite annoying
		at times. This little utility hangs itself on the VBI 
		(Vertical Blank Interrupt) to find out which window is 
		being activated and moves the screen to show the window in 
		full view. Version 3.3, an update to version 1.4 on disk 
		number 774. Includes source in assembler. Author: Jvrg

FastJPEG	FastJPEG is a fast JPEG picture viewer. Besides being fast,
		it has many other advantages. An important goal was to not 
		trade quality for speed. In fact, FastJPEG is both fast and
		has an excellent quality. Most other JPEG viewers either 
		produce ugly pictures, or need ages to perform the 
		conversion to HAM mode. Version 1.10, binary only. Author: 
		Christoph Feck

Harridan	A "Reminder" type program for your startup-sequence. Each 
		time you boot, Harridan will check your event list, if an

		it by a user-defined one, this utility was written. Force-
		Icon allows you to set the position of a disk's icon and/or
		replace it by a different image/icon which doesn't have to 
		be a disk.info file. All types of ".info" files may be 
		selected. GiftWare, Version 1.4, includes source. Author:

		Amiga system as the Imploder. In addition to this, its 
		algorithms are more efficient, both in terms of speed, and 
		size reduction. Version 4.0, binary only. Author: Albert-
		Jan Brouwer, Peter Struijk, Erwin Zwart, Paul van der Valk
