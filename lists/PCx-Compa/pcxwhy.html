With your Amiga you can do alot things. For nearly everything you can get software. So why should
you get a pc-emulator and use pc-software? I think, just for fun, or to impress your friends. And there
were still some kinds of programs, that were only available for PC.<P>
But how could you know what software runs on the emulator and what not? Here is the solution!
This list is for the PCx emulator from Microcode Solutions.<P>
I found two lists for Shapeshifter, but no for PCx (ok, there is a small on the HAAGE-Partner support-page).
So I decided to make my own. I hope it can help you and please help me to enhance it. It depends on YOU
(I know, that everybody says that ;-)).
