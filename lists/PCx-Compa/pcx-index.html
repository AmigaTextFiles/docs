<P>
This is a list with PC-software that is known to run on the PCx emulator from
<A HREF="http://www.microcode-solutions.com">Microcode Solutions</A>. At the moment it is very small, but
with your help it can grow. Would be nice if you would submit me the programs, that you know to run
on PCx. This list only covers commercial software.
