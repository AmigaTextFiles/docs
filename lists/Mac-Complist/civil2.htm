<td>Civilization....the most famous strategic game in the whole world....here
in its second incarnation. In this game your control a whole civilization and
try to let it survive from 3000 B.C. to the Space era conquering the world in

Wheel to the Superconductors, buld military units and conquer the world or build
a spaceship and colonize Alpha Centauri!<br>
This second Chapter features more discoveries, more buildings, more Wonders,
more units, better graphics, a more advanced diplomatic system and a refinated
