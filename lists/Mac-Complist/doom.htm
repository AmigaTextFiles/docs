MacDoom and MacDoom II run on my system. But, to my surprise, even with an
`060 they are slower than I had hoped. Certainly playable in low-res, though.
Absolutely <b> NO FUN </b> on 030.

<br>

tested on Amiga 3000, Cybervision 64, Cyberstorm 060 50MHz, 64MB FastRAM,
2MB ChipRAM, Apple CD300 2xSpeed CD-ROM.

<h3><b>
Doom:</b></h3>
First-person, Texture-mapped, 3D Dungeon Game. The classic texture-mapped game
which started the craze. The Mac version has an extra scenario not found on the 
PC version. You are Space-Marine who is trying to escape a lunar complex which 
has been overrun with all sorts of nasty monsters. Use the weapons, 4 scenarios,
28 different dungeon maps to explore. Pubished by ID.

<h3><b>
Doom II:</b></h3>
First-person, Texture-mapped, 3D Dungeon Game. The same game as the original Doom,
but with many more monsters, a new weapon, and all new maps and scenarios. Once
again you are the space-marine trying to escape a complex which is overrun with
monsters. This game is identical to the PC version. 8 weapons, 3 scenarios, over
30 different dungeon maps to explore. Published by ID.
