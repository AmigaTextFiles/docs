<td valign=top>Description:</td>
<td>Remember Wolf 394? The attack of the Borg Cube which destroyed 
mosts ships of the biggest armada ever?<br>
Yes, you do - your father died there a couple of years ago.
You are a StarFleet cadett, serving on a StarFleet's ship and the Borg are 
back again! Time for revenge? Naah, your captain evacates all unnecessary 
personal, and you have to go, too.
Then Q appears and offers you to travel back in time to kill some Borg and 
save your father's life...<p>
This game is a MUST for all Trekkies all over the world. Its an Interactive 
Movie based on the StarTrek series The Next Generation. At certain points you 
have to make decisions, which will involve the story. Getting borgified never 
been so much fun...<br>
It comes on 3 CDs; a bonus is the Picard Dossier on CD2, which presents valuable 
infos about the main protagonists of StarTrek in generally.</td>

<td valign=top>Ratings:</td>
<td>By drawing every second line (interlacing) the grafix (movie) is 
fast enough with Z2; I would recommend but Z3 for full pleasure.<br>
Do you want to cheat? At the point you have to make a decision, try typing<br>
- HUGH<br>
- BORG or<br>
- OBEY.</td>
