<td valign=top>Ratings:</td>
<td>Nice game with 6 CD`s. The Gameplay is kind of boring because all you have
to do is to klick objects in the right way. The Animations are filmed and
digitized which gives the game a touch of reality.<br>
For the AMIGA though it`s worth a buy because it`s the only game this way
and even of it`s easy structure better than any game on the AMIGA except the very
new Myst now.</td>
