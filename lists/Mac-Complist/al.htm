Al Unser Jr. Racing: I bought this, but it was BEFORE I had the  Warp
Engine,  and it was so slow then as to be totally unplayable. (I only
had a stock 3640 card that came with the A4000/040, though I did have
the  Cybervision  already.) I decided to take it back, because I just
couldn't see how it was going to get much better, even with the  Warp
Engine. But it did work.

<b>Tested on:</b><br>
A4000 with Macro-System's WARP ENGINE '040 running at 40 Mhz
Cybervision-64 (4-meg) Toshiba 6.7 speed SCSI-II CD-ROM
Amiga OS 3.1
