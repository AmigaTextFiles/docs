A utility for people who would like to change the mode (screentype) and
displaysize (overscan) of a picture or animation.  An animation, made in
f.i. a doubblescan resolution, can be forced into any other
(genlock-compatible?) mode, and complete directories of pictures can be
changed to any mode available.  This utility uses the information from the
graphics database to be able to ease your choice.
