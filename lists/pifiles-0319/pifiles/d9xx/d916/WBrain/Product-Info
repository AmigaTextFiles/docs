.description
A thinking game for the WorkBench.  The player must reproduce a random
pattern by filling in a grid in the correct order.  The difficulty ranges
from moderately easy to impossible.  Uses very little CPU time and very
little memory, so is ideal for playing while raytracing, etc.  Requires
OS2.0+, Amiga_E source code included.
