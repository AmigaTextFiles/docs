Hotkey/macro/multipurpose utility.
.description
Release 5.0, version 37.5 of the hotkey/macro/multipurpose utility.
You can record keystrokes and mouse events, manipulate screens and
windows, popup a shell, view the clipboard, blank the screen and much
more.  This release has a complete ARexx interface, so you can execute
ARexx programs and functions from hotkeys and store results in
environment variables.  The optional title bar clock is an AppWindow.
You can drop an icon in the clock and its name is set in a variable
for use in macros.  The documentation has been rewritten and includes
two indices.  This is the freely distributable release of 5.0.
It has been localized for deutsch and francais.
