Generates very nice looking Calendars
.description
Creates a very nice looking postscript calendar.  By default, PCal
simply prints an empty calendar.  Its real power is in its ability
to place ``events'' in appropriate days on the calendar, thus allowing
the user to create personalized calendars.  This is achieved through
the use of a "calendar.dat" file that has extraordinary flexibility.
