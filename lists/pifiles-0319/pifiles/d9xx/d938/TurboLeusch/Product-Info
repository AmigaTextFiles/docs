With the help of "Turbo-Leuschner" you are able to create
your own  menus for Workbench-based windows or expand already
existing menus.  Turbo-Leuschner supplies ALL functions of the
Workbench-Menu-System.  With Turbo-Leuschner, you supply the
name of the window and the menu file to attach to it, thus you
can attach menus to the "AmigaShell" window, your favorite
GUI-based utility, or simply the WorkBench Window itself.
