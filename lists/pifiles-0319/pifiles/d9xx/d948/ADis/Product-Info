.description
A 68000+ disassembler which can automatically recognize data and strings
put into the code segment.  It also generates only those labels that are
really referenced.  The generated file will often be reassemblable.  In
V1.1, ADis is capable of recognizing all 68020 and 68881 instructions even
with the 68020's extended addressing modes.  ADis will also try to resolve
addressing relative to a4, which many C compilers use in a small memory
model.
