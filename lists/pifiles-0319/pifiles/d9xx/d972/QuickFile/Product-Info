larger than available ram, but as much of the file as possible is kept
in ram for fast access.  Features include: multiple indexes that are
automatically maintained; character, date, integer and floating point
data types;	up to 250 characters per field and 250 fields per
record; form and list style displays and reports; unlimited number of
views for each file; fast sorting with multiple sort keys; improved
search function; fields can be added, changed, or deleted at any time;
flexible ascii export/import; flexible multi-column label printing.
Runs on WB1.3 or later and should be OK with 512K ram.
