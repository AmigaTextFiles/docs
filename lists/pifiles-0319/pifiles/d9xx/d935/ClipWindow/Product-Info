Pushes text onto the clipboard

A program that makes it easy to put frequently used text on the 
clipboard.  It opens an AppWindow on the Workbench which accepts 
Project icons and associated text files.  The text is copied to 
the clipboard ready for pasting.  Text may be in a separate disk 
file or directly entered as Tool Types in the Project icon.
