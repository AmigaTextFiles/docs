FreeWare Amiga BASIC compiler + extras
.description
ACE is a FreeWare Amiga BASIC compiler which, in conjunction with A68K
and Blink produces standalone executables.
 
The language defines a large subset of AmigaBASIC but also has many
features not found in the latter such as: turtle graphics, recursion,
SUBs with return values, structures, arguments, include files, a
better WAVE command which allows for large waveforms, external
references, named constants and a variety of other commands and
functions not found in AmigaBASIC.

New features in version 2.0 include: gadgets, three standard requester
types, serial I/O and menus (with optional command-keys for menu
items). New commands and functions for this version include EXIT FOR,
PTAB, SPC, DEF FN, ON ERROR and ERR (these last two handle file and
serial I/O at present). INPUT and PRINT can now be used transparently
for all screen/window combinations.

All user-defined windows are now fully-configurable and may be used in
conjunction with screens as per AmigaBASIC. Window close event
trapping is also a new feature.

In addition to event trapping, ACE now supports WAITing for both menus
and gadgets. Waiting is more operating-system-friendly than event
trapping.

A simple graphical front-end (Integrated Development Environment) is
also provided with the archive. This is written in ACE.
