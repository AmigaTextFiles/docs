.description
Enables you to select TeX format files easily.  Scans the directory where
your TeX format files reside and creates an array of radiobuttons of the
appropriate size.  Moreover, shows the filenotes of the format files making
it easier to remember the purposes of the format files.  Two versions of
the program, A very flexible one based an Stefan Stuntz's
MagicalUserInterface (MUI) and a less nice non-MUI version (of the same
functionality, however).  Also included is a 68000 version executable of
TeXPrt that was left off of disk number 892 by mistake.
