Personality pattern test
.description
The Duniho and Duniho Life Pattern Indicator (DDLI) is a program that
asks you questions in order to determine your Life Pattern.  The Life
Patterns correspond to the sixteen psychological types measured by the
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), and they are represented by the same
abbreviations.  By using knowledge that Terence Duniho has added to the
study of Type, this program also checks itself by asking supplementary
questions about other preferences that correlate with a person's type.
