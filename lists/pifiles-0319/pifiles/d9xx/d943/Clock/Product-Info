Clock
.description
A simple Clock program but with the handy feature that you can
"snapshot" the clock to stay with any screen or it can be free
to pop to the frontmost screen automatically.  Up to 4 alarm
times can be set, which can simply put up a requester or cause
some program to run in background.  Hourly chimes can also be
made to run a program (I.E. a sound sample player).  
.short
