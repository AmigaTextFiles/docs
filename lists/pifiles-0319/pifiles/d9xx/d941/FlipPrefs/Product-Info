.description
With this program, you can  create several preferences files,
(The "DEVS:system-configuration" type) of different names and
switch between them on command.  A sample usage would be to
customize the startup script to set different preferences
depending on the operating system booted into.  Could also be
useful in different development environments or for machines
with multiple users.
