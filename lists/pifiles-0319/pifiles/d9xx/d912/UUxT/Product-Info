Makes the task of uuencoding and decoding simple.  You can even lha and
uuencode multiple files in a single step! (And vice versa) Also, UUxT will
decode uuencoded files that have multiple mail files and other garbage in
them! Includes UUxT-GUI, an intuition frontend for UUxT.  It offers all the
power of UUxT, but from the workbench! It has a slick, WB 2.0 style look,
even under 1.3.  UUxT version 2.1, UUxT-GUI version 1.0.
