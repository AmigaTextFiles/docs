UUArc is an archiving system designed to enable easy transmission of binary
files/archives over communcation links only capable of using ASCII, such as
Electronic Mail.  It encodes binary files into files containing only
printable standard ASCII characters.  Written primarily for use with GuiArc
to add UUEncoding/UUDecoding facilities to it, it takes similar command
line options to other commonly used archiving programs.
