Searches files for embedded version ID
.description
This program searches an embedded version ID in a file.  Like the
'Version' command you can check the version and revision number of
a file.  You can also add this embedded version ID as a filenote,
or print it in a table where each field of the ID is clearly stated.
You can also construct your own version comment using embedded version
ID fields.  Binary only.
