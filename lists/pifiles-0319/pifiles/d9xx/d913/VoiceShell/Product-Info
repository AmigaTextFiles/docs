.description
VoiceShell is THE voice recognition program for the Amiga computer. It
allows you to start a program just by saying the program's name, actually
it allows you to control just about everything about your Amiga. VoiceShell
is a replacement project for VCLI by Richard Horne. VoiceShell however
uses the same library, also by Richard Horne, to recognize the words.
