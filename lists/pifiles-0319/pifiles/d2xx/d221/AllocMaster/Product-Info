.description
Allocmaster is a program inspired by Nick Sullivan's "Reserve" article in
Amiga Transactor, for controlling the amount of both Chip and Fast memory
available to the rest of the system.  It is very useful for testing
applications in low-memory situations.  It also has a snapshot feature to
report differences in available memory before and after running an
application.
