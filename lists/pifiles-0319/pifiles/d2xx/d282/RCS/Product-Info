The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of text files.
RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging, identification, and merging
of revisions. RCS is useful for text that is revised frequently, for
example programs, documentation, graphics, papers, form letters, etc.  This
is RCS version 1.2, and includes source (the source to the GNU diff program
used with this distribution of RCS can be found on disk 281).
