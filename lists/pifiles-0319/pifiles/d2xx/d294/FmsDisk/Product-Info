.description
A file based trackdisk simulator, useful for creating a floppy-like
partition on your hard disk (so you can diskcopy to a floppy) without
actually having to create a special partition for it.  Also useful for
testing new filesystems and such.  Supports up to 32 units, with either the
old filesystem or the new fast filesystem.
