This program will make an icon (.info file) using image data from either
another icon, or an IFF picture file.  The image data is drawn on the
screen so you can see exactly what your icon will look like.  You can also
go the other way, and make IFF files from icons, which can then be loaded
into a standard IFF graphics editor.  Source available from author.
