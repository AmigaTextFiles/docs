.description
A performance benchmark useful for comparing Amiga processing speeds.
Performs 10000 iterations of some selected groups of 68000 instructions
while using the DateStamp time function to record how many ticks it takes
to complete.  This timed duration is then compared against two known
prestored times, one for a stock A2000 Amiga and one for an A2620 enhanced
A2000.  A relative comparison is calculated and displayed.
