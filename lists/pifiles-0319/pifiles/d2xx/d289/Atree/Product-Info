A disk utility which imitates similar utilities widely available on IBM
compatibles (PC Tools, Xtree, QuickDos, etc).  The intent is to allow the
user a graphic representation of the entire directory structure on a disk
device, including the files in each directory, and the capability of moving
quickly through the tree to a directory to access its files.
