.description
This program replaces the DisplayBeep function so that an IFF 8SVX sound is
played instead of the screen flashing.  The PlayBeep function runs as a
task in the background and runs asynchronously so the length of the sound
does not slow anything down.  Includes a couple of sample sound files.
