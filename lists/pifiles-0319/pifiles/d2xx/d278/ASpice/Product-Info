.description
A version of the SPICE 2G.6 circuit analysis program which has been
modified to run in the Amiga environment.  The program arrays are adjusted
to require one tenth the memory of the DEC VAX version.  Although this does
not usually put much of a constraint on circuit analysis, some users who
are used to the full mainframe environment may have to be more aware of the
memory demands of their analysis.  Requires a minimum of 1 MB memory.  This
version neither supports nor requires the 68020 processor or 68881
coprocessor.  This is Amiga version 5.1.
