.description
VLT is both a VT100 emulator and a Tektronix (4014 plus subset of 4105)
emulator, currently in use at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center).
Although the VT100 part was originally based on Dave Wecker et al.'s VT100,
many enhancements were made. The program requires ARP, and it has an ARexx
port.  XMODEM 1K/CRC and Kermit protocol support also included.  Other
features include support for additional serial ports, external file
transfer protocols, and "chat" mode.  The Tektronix emulation allows saving
IFF files, PostScript files, and printing bitmaps to the printer.  It comes
in two versions, one with Tektronix emulation, and one without.  Other
changes include full XPR version 2.0 support, and a
scrollback/review/history buffer.
