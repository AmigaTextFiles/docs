A very nicely done scientific/programmer/plotter calculator.  The
scientific portion has most of the operations found on the more popular
handhelds. The programmer portion has all the special hex/binary/decimal
conversions as well as register operations like ASL, ROL, LSL, AND, OR,
XOR, etc.  The plotter portion will plot equations.  Other features include
26 memories, full mouse or keyboard operation, pull-down menus, and
iconization.
