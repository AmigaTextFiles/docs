Multiplot XLN is a fully intuitive data plotting program. It plots
data points as (x,y) co-ordinates with or without x or y error
bars. It can plot an unlimited number of sets with any number of data
points using colour, line type, line weight, point shape and point
size to represent the different sets. A set may be joined by a line or
plotted as discrete points. Data may be impulse plotted, scatter
plotted, or shown as a histogram or step graph. Additions to the data
may be made in the form of lines of best fit (logarithmic,
exponential, linear and polynomial) and data smoothing utilising
modified open b-splines or averaging filtration.

The input file for Multiplot is a simple textfile and my be created
in any ASCII text editor or saved from any spreadsheet. Multiplot
supports the clipboard, and data input may be achieved solely through
it. Multiplot has a full ARexx interface which provides potential for
a wide variety of data manipulations including statistical analysis.
Output may be in any of the following formats: IntroCAD, Draw, mCAD,
IFF, Revised Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (HPGL/2), Encapsulated
Postscript (EPSF) or Postscript. The graph can be printed to any
workbench printer by transparent use of the PLT: device. Multiplot
directly supports the HP LaserJet III and Postscript laser printers
such as the Apple Laser printer.
