.description
Examines given file(s) and takes an educated guess as 
to their type. File types looked for include:- fonts,
icons, executables, objects, compressed, command scripts,
C source, directories, iffs, LaTeX source, modula II source,
shell commands and scripts, TeX source, dvi, uuencoded, 
yacc, zoo, lha(rc). 
Changes to original include looking for a few more types,
improving its IQ slightly, and amending source to compile ANSI-C 
under SAS/C 6.0.
