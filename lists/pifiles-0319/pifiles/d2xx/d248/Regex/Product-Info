An Amiga shared library version of the GNU regular expression package from
the Free Software Foundation.  A regular expression is a concise method of
describing a pattern of characters in a string. By use of special
wildcards, almost any pattern can be described. A regular expression
pattern can be used for searching strings in such programs as editors or
other string handling programs.
