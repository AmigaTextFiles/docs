.description
A program to animate up to 6 planetary masses, all of which exert a mutual
gravitational force on each other.  The planetary masses can be placed
anywhere on the screen, and their mass and initial velocity can be
determined by the user.  The program then steps the animation through time,
plotting and displaying the new position in the trajectory of each mass.
