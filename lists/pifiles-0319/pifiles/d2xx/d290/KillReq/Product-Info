.description
A small program which disables Intuition's AutoRequest function.  In
particular, this prevents AmigaDOS from putting up system requesters, which
is useful if you are operating your Amiga remotely and can't use the mouse
to click CANCEL.  Unlike similar utilities which affect only a single CLI,
KillReq disables ALL requesters.  This is version 1.0 and includes C
source.
