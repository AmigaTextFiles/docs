`Safe, Sane & Fast' IPC Standard
.description
An IPC (Inter-Process Communication) package, with the goal
of creating a standard for IPC on the Amiga that is
flexible enough to handle the widest possible range of
applications. The protocol used addresses different problem
areas than does ARexx, and emphasizes different aspects of
the communication process, such as fast communication and
preservation of data structure. Includes source.
