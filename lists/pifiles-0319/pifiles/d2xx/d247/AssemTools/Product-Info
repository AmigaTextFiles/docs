.description
A collection of files which should be of great interest to Amiga assembly
language programmers.  The collection includes 140 macro routines which
make assembly language programming a lot easier.  There is also a library
of routines containing buffered C-like file handling functions (fopen,
fclose, fgets, fputs, etc) and a file name requester.  All routines are
re-entrant.  For example programs using the macros and library, and a 65c02
cross macro assembler.
