Almost 300 icons in eight (!) colors.  Uses a special program to get an
eight color workbench to display these icons, which were made with DPaintII
and IconGen.  Most icons are miniatures of the main screen of their
corresponding programs, or the picture they show, made with "iconize" and
"recolor" from disk 85.
