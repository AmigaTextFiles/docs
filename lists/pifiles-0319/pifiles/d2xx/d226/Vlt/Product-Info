VLT is both a VT100 emulator and a Tektronix (4014 plus subset of 4105)
emulator, currently in use at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center).
Although the VT100 part was originally based on Dave Wecker et al.'s VT100,
many enhancements were made. The program requires ARP, and it has an ARexx
port.  XMODEM 1K/CRC and Kermit protocol support also included.  With many
enhancements over the previous version, 3.656, included on disk 202.  New
features include support for other serial ports, external file transfer
protocols, and "chat" mode.  Improved behavior on the Workbench.  Tektronix
emulation now allows saving IFF files, PostScript files, and printing
bitmaps to the printer.  Many other enhancements and bug fixes.
