.description
A program for A1000 hardware hackers that have done the Amazing Computing
512K upgrade.  KickMem will patch your 1.2 or 1.3 kickstart disk to perform
addmem during kickstart.  This allows warm boot surviveability of ram disk
devices and eliminates addmem commands from your startup sequence.
