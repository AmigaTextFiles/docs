This program graphically simulates the evolution of a species of "bugs",
the insect kind.  Bugs, represented by moving blobs, eat bacteria
represented by single pixels.  They mutate, compete for food, reproduce and
pass their mutations to their offspring.  Fascinating example of graphics
and software simulation.  Standalone image and source code.
