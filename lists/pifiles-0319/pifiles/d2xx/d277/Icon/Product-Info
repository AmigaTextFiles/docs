.description
A high-level programming language with extensive facilities for processing
strings and lists. Icon has several novel features, including expressions
that may produce sequences of results, goal-directed evaluation that
automatically searches for a successful result, and string scanning that
allows operations on strings to be formulated at a high conceptual level.
Icon resembles SNOBOL4 in its emphasis on high-level string processing and
a design philosophy that allows ease of programming and short, concise
programs.  This is version 7.5 of the public domain implementation of Icon
from the University of Arizona.  It is an update to version 6.0 from disk
81.
