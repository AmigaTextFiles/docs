This program creates a small intro on the bootblock of any disk, which will
appear after you insert the disk for booting.  This is the "next
generation" BootIntro, a more colorful version than the one on disk 244,
but the text must be shorter.  The first line can be up to 24 characters.
The second and third lines can be up to 22 characters.  The scrolling text
can be up to 98 characters.  This is "next generation version 1.1".
