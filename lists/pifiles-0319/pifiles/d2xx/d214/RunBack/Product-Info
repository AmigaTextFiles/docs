.description
Another step in the evolution of Rob Peck's RunBackGround program, from
disks 73 and 152.  Allows you to start a new CLI program and run it in the
background, then closes the new CLI.  This version has been enhanced to use
the NULL: device by Gunnar Nordmark (included), which is a "real" device,
so it solves problems with previous versions of RunBack which used the Nil:
"fake" device, causing many crashes.
