.description
A neat little game with graphics and sound, ported from the Unix version,
originally written on a Sun workstation.  The idea for Wanderer came from
games such as Boulderdash, Xor, and the Repton games from Superior
Software.  Includes a builtin editor for extending the game by adding
additional screens.
