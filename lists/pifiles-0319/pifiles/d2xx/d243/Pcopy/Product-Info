An intuition based disk copier similiar to the resident "DiskCopy".  A
highly upgraded rewrite of the version on disk 151.  It features high speed
diskcopy with write-verify and data recovery from damaged tracks.  A lot of
effort has gone into making this copier friendly in its usage, as well in
its multitasking properties.
