An Amiga program to display images from a CT scanner, along with several
new interesting sample images of scans of real people.  The display
software, though it has a primitive user interface, is quite powerful,
including functions like convolutions, averaging, laplacians, unsharp
masking, edge detection, gradients, etc.  An update to the version on disk
137.  Additional image disks available from author.
