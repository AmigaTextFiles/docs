.description
An Amiga port of the Small-C compiler, written by Ron Cain and published in
Dr. Dobb's Journal, in about 1980.  Small-C is a rather small subset of the
full 'C' language.  However, it is capable of compiling itself, and other
small, useful programs.  Requires an assembler and linker to complete the
package and produce working executables.  And binary.
