Volume 2 of the 2 volume Stony Brook Prolog (SBP) distribution, version
2.3.2.  This volume contains the C and Prolog source code.  Volume 1, on
disk 140, contains the executables and libraries.  From the SB-Prolog
System, Version 2.2 User Manual: "SB-Prolog is a public-domain Prolog
system for Unix(tm) based systems originally developed at SUNY, Stony
Brook.  The core of the system is an emulator, written in C for
portability, of a Prolog virtual machine that is an extension of the Warren
Abstract Machine.  The remainder of the system, including the translator
from Prolog to the virtual machine instructions, is written in Prolog." In
addition to providing a compiler, SB-Prolog also offers advanced features
such as dynamic loading, mixing of compiled and interpreted code, macros,
extension tables, a debugging facility offering two levels of tracing,
profiling tools, and other utilities.
