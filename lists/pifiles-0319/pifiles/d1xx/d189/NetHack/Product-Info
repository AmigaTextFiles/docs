.description
You have just finished your years as a student at the local
adventurer's guild. After much practice and sweat you have
finally completed your training and are ready to embark upon a
perilous adventure. As a test of your skills, the local guild
masters have sent you into the Dungeons of Doom. Your task is to
return with the Amulet of Yendor. Your reward for the completion
of this task will be a full membership in the local guild. In
addition, you are allowed to keep all the loot you bring back
from the dungeons.
