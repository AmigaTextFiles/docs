.description
English to C (and vice versa) translator for C declarations.  This little
gem will translate english such as "declare foo as pointer to function
returning pointer to array 10 of pointer to long" into "long
*(*(*foo)())[10]", and vice versa.  An absolute must for anyone except
possibly the most hardcore C guru.
