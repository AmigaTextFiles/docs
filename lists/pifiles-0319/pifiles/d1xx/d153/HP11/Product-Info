.description
Emulates an HP11C calculator including the program mode.  Features an
ON/OFF button that turns the calculator into an icon that will sit and wait
until you need it again.  Documentation on the features is scarce, perhaps
some industrious HP owner could write a small tutorial for the benefit of
those that don't own an HP calculator.
