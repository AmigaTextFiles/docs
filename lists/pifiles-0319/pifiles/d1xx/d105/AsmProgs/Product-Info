Some misc assembly tools, programs, etc.  "AsmFilter" (actually in
AmigaBASIC) turns the output of the Metacomco disassembler into a file that
can be re-assembled.  "AddKickMem" adds the KickStart memory to your free
memory on an Amiga 1000 with Kickstart in ROM.  "Clear" fills unused areas
of memory with a specific byte pattern.  "L" is a replacement for the BCPL
"list" program, but with some graphics enhancements.  "SharpFont" is an 8
pixel non-proportional font.  "Stack" is a replacement for the BCPL stack
program.  Includes some source.
