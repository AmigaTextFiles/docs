.description
A fractal generator program that generates fractal pictures from "seeds"
that you create.  This is unlike any of the other "fractal generators" I've
seen.  It can be used to load and display previously created fractal
pictures, modify existing fractals, or create your own fractals.  Update to
version on disk 142.
