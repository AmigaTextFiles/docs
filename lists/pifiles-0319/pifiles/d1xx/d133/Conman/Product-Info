.description
Extremely useful replacement for the standard console handler, that
provides line editing and command line histories completely transparent to
any application program that uses CON: windows.  This program is shareware,
and well worth a donation to the author.  Update to version on disk 100.
New features include additional editing keys, fast search keys, undo key,
clear history command, and more.
