This animation, unveiled at the September 87 meeting of the First Amiga
Users Group, got Leo a standing ovation.  It is a "must see" for every
Amiga user, and ranks up there with "Juggler" as a premier demo for the
Amiga.  The difference between this distribution, and the one on disk 100,
is that this one includes "source".  I.E.  it contains all the object
descriptions necessary to recreate the animation.  Thus you can, if you
like, try modifying various objects to create slightly different
animations, or use it as an example for creating your own animations.
Seldom does a disk get devoted to a single program, however animation is
one of the Amiga's greatest strengths, and I felt it was appropriate to
have at least one animation that was available at the "source code" level.
