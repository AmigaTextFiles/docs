.description
A variant of Rob Peck's RunBackground program from disk number 73.
Allows you to start a new CLI program and run it in the background,
and then close the CLI.  This version automatically searches the
command search path to find the program; this code comes from
Carolyn Scheppner's "which" program.  Includes source.
