.description
A simple game that let's you push your memory. It is played with a deck
of 32 cards, grouped in 16 pairs. The cards are shuffled and then displayed
at the beginning of each game. Your goal is to pick up as many pairs as you
can, until there are no cards left on the screen.
You can play either against a human or a computer player.
