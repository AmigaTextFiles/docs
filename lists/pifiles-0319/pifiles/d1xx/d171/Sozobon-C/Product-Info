Atari ST version of what appears to be a full K&R freeware C-compiler,
assembler and linker.  The compiler main pass and the assembler were
compiled and tested on an Amiga A2000 with only minimal changes, and they
appear to work (to the extent that they believe they are running on an
Atari-ST), so an Amiga port should be relatively easy.
