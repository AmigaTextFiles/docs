Matthew Brandt; major porting work by Jeff Lydiatt 
.description
An optimizing C compiler for the 68000 processor.  This is an update to the
version first released on disk 53, though apparently not based on the code
from that disk.  Major porting work was done by Jeff Lydiatt to get it to
the point where it would compile and execute simple programs on the Amiga.
This version now generates metacomcocompatible assembler source code, which
can be assembled by the assembler also provided on this disk and then
linked by the freely redistributable linker "blink" (also provided).
Includes all compiler source and some library and startup source code.
Requires amiga.lib from developers kit to generate complete running example
executables.
