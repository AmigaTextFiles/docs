.description
Make controlled approximations between two files.  Similar to "diff" but
more versatile.  Allows for the handling of numerals as string literals or
numeric values with adjustable tolerances.  Provides for embedded commands,
scriptfiles, and many other command-line parameters.  Potentially very
useful, but needs some Amiga-specific work.  Source and some example files
included.
