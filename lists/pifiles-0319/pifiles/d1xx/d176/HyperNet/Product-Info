HyperNet
.description
-------HyperNet is a small hypertext shell program for Amiga, presented
with sources and brief documents. It was also submitted by Glenn Everhart,
the author.  HyperNet allows a "master" AmigaDos process to control a
series of connected processes, where the connections are randomly ordered
directed graphs. Permissible "child" processes available at any stage are
governed by the links of the graph. The implementation is mainly
instructive, but can be used for tutorials or demonstrations and
illustrates the simplicity of hypertext concepts on a multi-tasking system.
