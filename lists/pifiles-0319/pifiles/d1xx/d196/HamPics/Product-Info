These are some of the most stunning digitized pictures yet for the Amiga.
They were scanned at a resolution of 4096 by 2800 pixels, 36-bits per
pixel, on an Eikonix 1435 slide scanner, cropped, gamma corrected, scaled,
and converted to Amiga IFF HAM files.  They are displayed with a special
ILBM loader that handles overscan HAM images.  For the display program.
