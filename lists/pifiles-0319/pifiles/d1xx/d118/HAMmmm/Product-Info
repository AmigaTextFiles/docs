This is Phil's entry for the Badge Killer Demo Contest.  HAMmmm displays
lines whose end points are bouncing around the screen, which is a double
buffered HAM screen.  The Y positions of the points are continuously copied
into an audio waveform that is played on all four channels, and the pitch
of a just intoned chord is derived from the average X position of these
points.
