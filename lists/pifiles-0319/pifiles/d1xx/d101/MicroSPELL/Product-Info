.description
MicroSPELL is a standalone spelling checker which scans text files and
reports on misspelled words.  It has a 1000 word "common word" list, a
43,000 word main dictionary, and supports multiple user dictionaries.  Also
interfaces quite nicely with MicroEMACS 3.9, with an emacs macro to step
through the source file, stopping at each suspect word and allowing the
user to dispose of it in different ways.
