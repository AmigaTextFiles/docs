This program clears the position info of any of your icons to allow
WorkBench to pick a reasonable place for the icon again. Useful for disk
and drawer icons where Snapshot rewrites the icon and the window
information. Written in Modula-2, another demo for M2Amiga, showing the
simplicity of programming with this Modula-2 compiler.
