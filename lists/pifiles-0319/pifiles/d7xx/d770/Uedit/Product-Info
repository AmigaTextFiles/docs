configurations and utilities.  Included are emulation configurations for
VI, EDT and wordstar, a directory utility, hypertext utilities, help key
utilities and much more.  Parts 1 & 2 of the distribution may be found on

editor with a learn mode, a command language, menus, hypertext, online
help, a teach mode, split windows, copy and paste, undo, spell-checking,
many wordprocessing features and more.
