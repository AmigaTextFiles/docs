.description
Newest File Date.  Searches the specified directory for the newest file,
then returns that filename and path as an ARP global variable.  For people
without ARP, it allows you to execute a command line, specified as a
parameter, with the file name and path inserted at a specified point.
Sample usage would to be have a word processor automatically load the last
file worked on when it was invoked.
