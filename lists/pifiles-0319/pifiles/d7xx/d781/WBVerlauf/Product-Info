Allows the owners of AGA machines to create a nice Copper background for a
selectable color, using the whole 16 million color range of the AGA chips.
By specifying the color of the first and the last line of the screen,
WBVerlauf will make a smooth color change by setting a new color value on
every scanline.  Requires Kickstart 3.0.
