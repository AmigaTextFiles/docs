.description
A very small 2.04-only utility that patches the graphics.library function
MakeVPort() in such a way to avoid an annoying bug that keeps multipalette
pictures from being correctly scrolled (multipalette pictures contain the
new PCHG chunk which specifies line-by-line palette changes; hundreds of
colors can be displayed even in hi-res with multitasking and full system
compatibility).
