.description
A very powerful replacement for the AmigaDOS 'List' and 'Dir' commands.  It
gives full control on the format of the directory listing and what
information should be printed.  The directory can be sorted on any field,
or on several fields in the order you want.  Supports many filters, such as
name and date, and the filters can be made effective on files only,
directories only or on both.  You can also define a pattern for each level
of the directory tree.  Has an LFORMAT option which is useful for
generating scripts.  A unique feature is the ability to monitor the
scanning process.  English version supplied, German, French and Dutch
versions available from the author.
