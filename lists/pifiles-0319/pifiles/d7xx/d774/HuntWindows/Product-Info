.description
Starting with 2.0 you can make screens bigger than the visual size of your
monitor.  On a double-size workbench, catching windows like requesters etc.
can be quite annoying at times.  This little utility hangs itself on the
Vertical Blank interrupt to find out which window is being activated and
moves the screen to show the window in full view.
