Data Acq. & Processing - Graphic-diagram
.description
A graphic-diagram based, interactive environment for data
acquisition and processing. This is a freely distributable
demonstration edition that has a restricted set of modules,
and cannot save things to disk, but is otherwise fully
featured. The concept is of data packets travelling along
paths between data handling elements. Configurations are
built by placing and connecting the desired elements on
screen using the mouse.
