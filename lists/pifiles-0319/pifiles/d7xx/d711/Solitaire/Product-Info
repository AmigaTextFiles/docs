.description
A shareware solitaire game of klondike solitaire.  The rules can be varied,
and there are five different ways of working through the deck.  Also
includes an undo function that will un-move more than the last move, a
wrapup function for when a game is all but won, a palette requester to fine
tune the colors to your liking and a save-setup function that remembers how
all the options are set.
