.description
Removes all ANSI codes from a text file so that only the bare text remains.
It is useful for editing terminal program capture buffers.  Two versions
are provided: one for the command line (CLI) and one with a full Intuition
interface.  You can selectively strip certain codes, and generate a report.
New features include more codes, better help, and tab expansion.
