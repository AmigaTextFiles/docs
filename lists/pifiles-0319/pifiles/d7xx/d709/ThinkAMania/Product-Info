A 'Concentration' like board game.  It features excellent hires graphics,
funny sound effects and enormous fun for up to two players regardless of
age and education.  This shareware version is 100% functional, but does
inlcude a requester that pops up from time to time to remind you of the
shareware fee.  All options are available and the complete set of stones is
integrated.
