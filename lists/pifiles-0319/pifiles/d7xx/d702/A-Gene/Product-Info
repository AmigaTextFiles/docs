Latest demo version of a popular genealogy database program.  A-Gene now
supports both PAL and NTSC systems.  This demo is complete but limited to
200 persons/70 marriages, and does not have on-line help.  A-Gene includes
a text-editor to add free-form reports to records and allows you to show
digitised pictures from within the program.  This version also includes
Ordinances for Church of Latter Day Saints users.  Pedigree charts and
family group sheets, among other reports, can be printed.  A-Gene needs 1Mb
of ram.
