An evolved version of the public domain game Hack, written by Jay Fenlason,
Andries Brouwer, Don Kneller and various others.  Hack Lite is a dungeon
adventure game in the style of Rogue, Hack, Moria, etc.  It uses a
customizable graphical dungeon display.  The package includes a
simple-to-use installation program, and a "Preferences"-style configuration
editor.  Many new objects, traps, monsters and ways to die have been added.
Saved games are now much smaller, and a "Tournament mode" allows several
players to compete for the highest score playing in identical dungeons.
Utilities included with Hack Lite were written by Jim Cooper and Doug
Walker.
