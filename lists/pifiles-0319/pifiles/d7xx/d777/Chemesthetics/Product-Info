.description
Chemesthetics uses the calotte model to draw molecules.  It has an
Intuition user interface, can save pictures as IFF files and has many
example files.  The new version lets you raise the task priority for the
painting process to get the results faster, shadow and reflection color can
now be set to your desires, quicktrans.library is used for even faster
painting.  Versions for a math coprocessor and utilties to convert data
files from Molec3D and to DKBTrace are included.
