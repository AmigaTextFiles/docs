The BootBlock Utility.  Includes functions to store, install, view or
execute any disk bootblock.  Also, self-made bootblocks can be installed to
disk.  The most powerful function is to save any bootblock as an executable
CLI-File.  Now you can start any boot-util, viruschecker, game, or loader
from the CLI.  Also includes a drawer with 33 bootblocks from the BootX
BootBlock-Library.  BootJob requires Amiga OS2.0.
