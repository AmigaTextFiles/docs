.description
A new command line interpreter, designed to replace the CBM shell.
Features include file name completion, pattern expansion, expression
computation, command history, for...done loops, and much more.  Almost
fully compatible with ARP or Commodore shells.  With full support of
AmigaDOS 2.04, a heavily modified parser, "pure" code, a few
Enforcer/Mungwall hits removed, and other bug fixes and enhancements.
Requires "arp.library" under 1.3.
