Demo version of VIDEO MUSIC BOX, a program designed to provide an easy to
learn and use facility that non-musicians or beginning musicians can use to
compose original background music for their Amiga multimedia productions.
No prior music compositional knowledge is required to generate basic
musical styles from pre-arranged music pattern templates and chord
progressions.  Individuals having increased musical backgrounds can use the
many included editors to define new chord-types, "revoice" chords, create
new chord progressions, perform basic sequence editing, and create
additional pattern templates.  Supports both MIDI Format 0 and IFF SMUS
music file formats for compatibility with all multimedia authoring
programs.  Second major upgrade to version 1.0 on disk number 660.  This
new version is AmigaDOS 2 compatible, allows unlimited pattern generation
in a single sequence, has improved musical dynamics, and expanded MIDI.
Requires 1 Meg.
