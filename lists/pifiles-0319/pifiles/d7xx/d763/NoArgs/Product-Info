.description
The Arguments Utility.  Never again get weak-minded by typing those long
Command lines including hundreds of Arguments/Parameters.  With NoArgs you
can create a new executable command that calls the original command and
automatically passes it the arguments you specified, without having to
execute any Batch/Scriptfiles.  Requires Amiga OS2.0.
