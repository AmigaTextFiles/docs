Allows the user to generate a double sided document from a single sided
one.  Two output documents are created: an ODDS set and an EVENS set.  The
odds set can be printed on single sheet or tractor feed paper, reversed and
re-inserted in the printer, then the even set can be printed on the reverse
side.  Page sizes are all fully editable by the user, along with certain
other parameters.  Handles predefined page breaks eloquently.  Saves paper,
and storage space.  Requires kickstart 1.3 or 2.0 to operate.
