Based on Olaf Barthel's "LoadImage v1.11".  SeePix is an IFF
viewer/printer, featuring the ability to modify the colors of a pic for
printing, allowing for truer colors in the printout (i.e. Blue prints Blue,
not Purple), without modifying the pic itself.  SeePix features an ARP
interface, Iconization and the PathMaster File Selector.  Manx AZTEC "C"
Source included.
