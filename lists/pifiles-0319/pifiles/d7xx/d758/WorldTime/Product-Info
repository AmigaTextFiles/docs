A clock that can show you the time in any city in the world.  The times are
calculated automatically using data supplied by the user.  Rewritten to
take advantages of features available under Kickstart 2, and thus will not
run under 1.2 or 1.3 anymore.  A commodity that can be run from the
workbench or CLI
