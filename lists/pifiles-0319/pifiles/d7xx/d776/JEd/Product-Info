.description
Yet another programmer's editor.  Lots of features, including: total
customization, a powerful programming language, multifile/multi-view
editing, number of windows is only limited by memory, clipboard support
(cut/paste on any unit), any window can have any (non-proportional) font,
an Arexx interface, and more.  (apparently unrelated to the version of Jed
on disk 297).  Requires OS2.0 or later.
