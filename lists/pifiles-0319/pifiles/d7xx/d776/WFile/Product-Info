.description
Small but useful tool to interchange ASCII files between different
operating systems.  Converts foreign symbols and adapts linefeed codes.
Can also be used to expand tabs to multiple spaces or vice versa.  It has
builtin templates for interchange between Amiga, MS-DOS, OS/2 and UNIX
systems.  Profiles can be used for common adaptions.  The new version
contains new templates and the memory management system has been revised
and optimized.
