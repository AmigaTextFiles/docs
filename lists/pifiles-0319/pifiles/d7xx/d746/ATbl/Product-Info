.description
A program for table formating, somehow inspired by the "tbl" utility on
UNIX system.  Can produce a printer output (with IBM semi-graphic
characters) or a regular IFF file which can be read by any decent
word-processing or desktop-publishing program.  Both French and English
documentation.  An update from version 1.00 on disk 583, with a lot of bugs
fixed and a few enhancements.
