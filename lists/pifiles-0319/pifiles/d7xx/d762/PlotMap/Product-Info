.description
PlotMap is a tool like DrawMap from Bryan Brown that draws a map of the
world's surface.  PM uses the same map files as DrawMap 4.0/4.1 but has
several improvements: much faster, runs on 512 KB machines with just one
floppy, more configurable, zoom box from a box map, definable screen mode,
abortable drawing.  This version requires OS 2.04.  First release.
