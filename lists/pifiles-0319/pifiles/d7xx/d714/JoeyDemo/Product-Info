A demo version of a Sokoban type game where your task is to push Grullies
(the only food of the Joey) to the stock, which is designated with little
rhombic symbols on the floor.  To complicate things there are iceblocks and
teleporters.  The demo version contains 5 levels while the registered
version contains 60 levels.
