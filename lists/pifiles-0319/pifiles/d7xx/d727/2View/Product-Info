2View is an ILBM picture viewer for use under Workbench 2.0.  It supports
all standard ECS graphics modes, SHAM, MacroPaint-style dynamic hires,
ARexx and both the CLI and Workbench. This fixes a couple of bugs in the
previous version and adds support for 2.04-style wildcards when used from
the shell.
