.description
A replacement for the "makedir" command.  It can create directories and
files.  Useful for some editors and other programs that allow you to you
define a file to load at starttime.  In this case files can be created
before calling these programs that usually give you nervous requesters on
nonexisting files.  It accepts multiple files and directories, and is also
useful for batchfiles.  OS 2.xx only.
