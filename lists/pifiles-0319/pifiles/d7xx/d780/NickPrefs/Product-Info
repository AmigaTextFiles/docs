Three new preferences editors for WB2
.description
An enhancement to IPrefs that provides three new preferences to
Workbench 2.x users:\n
WBPicture allows you to display any IFF picture in the main
Workbench window, supplanting the original WBPattern.\n
BusyPointer lets you edit the clock pointer used by programs
when they are busy. You may create an animated pointer.\n
Floppy provides the ability to mess with the public fields of
trackdisk.device, that is, the TDPF_NOCLICK flag, step delay and
the like.
