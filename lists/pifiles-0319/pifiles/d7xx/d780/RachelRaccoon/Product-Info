.description
These pictures are hand-drawn pictures of a new cartoon character
named 'Rachel the Raccoon'. These pictures are in overscanned
NTSC-Hires-Interlace (704x480) and are provided in 16-colour,
8-colour, and 4-colour so you can use them for your Workbench
backdrop pictures. The colours are arranged so that at you will have
standard looking titlebars and menues.  These pictures are styled after
the 'Eric Schwartz' type of pictures, but the character of Rachel is a
totally original creation.
