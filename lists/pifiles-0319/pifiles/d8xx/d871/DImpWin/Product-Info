efficient disk archivers available for the Amiga. It
offers 7 different levels of compression, the 
ability to create self extracting archives,
Multiple cylinder ranges, ability to work
with any  floppy compatible device, (such as
RAD: & FMS disks) and it can also add a text
file to the archive that will be displayed during 
extraction. Via the GUI interface, Dimp-Win will
invoke  Dimp & tell it what to do.
