A very versatile directory listing utility.  It can examine the contents of
files and display a short type description.  In addition, FInf has a whole
slew of options that allow you to filter files by type, date, age, size
etc., as well as recursive directory descending, and adjustable output
formatting.  So next to simply listing directories, FInf is extremely
useful for creating hybrid commands that perform functions closely tuned to
your specific needs.
