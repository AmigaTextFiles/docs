.description
An automated DMake file generator.  You give it the names of
all the C-files used to produce your executable (except
#include'd .c or .h files), and it will automatically scan
them to find all dependencies, and produce a ready to use
(in many cases) DMakeFile calling DCC with options you will
need for normal compilation and linking.
