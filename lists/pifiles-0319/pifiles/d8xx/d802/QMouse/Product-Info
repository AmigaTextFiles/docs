.description
An unusually small and feature-packed "mouse utility".  Was inspired by,
but not derived from, the original QMouse by Lyman Epp.  Features include
automatic window activation (like WindX), top-line blanking for A3000/A2320
users, systemfriendly mouse blanking, mouse acceleration/threshold,
"PopCLI", click-to-front/back, "SunMouse", "NoClick", "WildStar", Northgate
key remapping, and more.  Requires Kickstart 2.0, but is not a commodity.
Only 3K.  Assembly source included.
