.description
FRequest is a handy program which lets you select a file by using the ASL
file requester and executes a CLI command with the given selection.
FRequest can be easily used in batch files and has a lot of options.  You
can use it as an frontend for any program which does not directly support
filerequester selections.  It exchanges '[]' in the specified command line
with the selection.  It has a debug ability for testing of options before
execution.  It now supports multiple file selections and the save
filerequester option.  Requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.
