.description
Munges memory and watches for illegal FreeMem's.  Especially useful in
combination with Enforcer.  Output can go to either the serial or parallel
port.  Includes a new MungList program that examines used memory areas for
MungWall tag info, and outputs a list of who owns the various pieces of
allocated memory, their sizes, etc.  Can even identify the owner of the
memory by task name.
