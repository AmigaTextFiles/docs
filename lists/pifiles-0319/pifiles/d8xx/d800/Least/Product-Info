A small, handsome, text displayer that only supports those functions most
frequently used.  String searching is performed with the very fast
Boyer-Moore algorithm.  Also checks itself for link viruses.  Runs from
both WorkBench and CLI.  Separate version LeastP also deals with
powerpacked files. Has been tested under both Kickstart 1.3 and 2.0.
