Two programs to help teach Japanese.  "Word A Day" is a popup program to
put in your WBStartup drawer.  It will randomly select one word out of it's
1019 word database and display it along with the English.
"JapaneseVocabulary" is a quiz type Japanese vocabulary builder.  Both
programs are standalone and complete, and also work with the "Japanese
Talking Picture Dictionary" by the same author.
