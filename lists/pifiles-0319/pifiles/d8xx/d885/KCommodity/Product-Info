in order to let the user have a simple control panel for
all the functions. It comes as three different programs in
order to minimize size. These programs are: The main program
(running all the time), the Prefs program (for setting up
KCommodity; only launched on demand, thus reducing memory
usage), and a special Screen grabber type program which
will be launched as soon as you hit a specific HotKey.
Using this grabber you may copy Screen/Winodow contents to
a gfx-capable printer or even to an IFF-ILBM file. KCommodity
is completely localized to nearly every language supported
by the system and even comes with a new language file for suomi.
