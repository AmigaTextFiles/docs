TeXPrt
.description
A front-end for DVI printer drivers with a (nice?) GUI.  It is
highly configurable and can be used with various DVI printer
drivers.  Configuration files for Georg Hessmann's DVIPrint
(PasTeX), DVILJP (AmigaTeX) and DVILJ2P (Gustaf Neumann) are
included.  TeXPrt has an ARexx port and interprets 18 ARexx
commands.  TeXPrt runs on an AppWindow and supports an
(optional) AppIcon for selecting DVI files.
