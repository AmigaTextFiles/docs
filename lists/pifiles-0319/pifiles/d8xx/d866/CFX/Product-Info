.description
Crunched File eXaminer allows the user to examine and find files using
several different search criteria.  CFX knows a huge amount of the current
Amiga filetypes, including a vast number of "cruncher" types.  CFX can also
give in-depth disassemblies of crunched files, including most address
crunched files, relocator crunched files, and some major archive crunched
types.  This version requires kick 1.3 or 2.0.
