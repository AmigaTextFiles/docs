VCLI
.description
The final version (7.0) of Voice Command Line Interface (VCLI)
which will execute CLI commands, ARexx commands, or ARexx
Scripts by voice command.  VCLI allows you to launch multiple
applications or control any program with an ARexx capability
entirely by spoken voice command.  Many improvements requested
by users are now included.  VCLI now has its own ARexx port so
that its internal options and functions can be controlled by
ARexx command.  Menu operations have been improved. This is the
fastest version of VCLI yet.
