AniMan
.description
The final version (5.2) of AniMan, the voice recognition
program that allows you to converse with an animated talking
head to execute any ARexx or CLI command.  AniMan appears as
a full color animation in a miniature window on the 3.0 Work-
bench screen.  AniMan is fully multitasking and runs in the
foreground or background, listening for your voice commands
even while other programs may be running.  Many improvements
requested by users are now included.  Menu operations have
been improved.
