.description
A commodity which enables the user to manipulate windows with 43 user
definable hotkey commands.  You can move, size, resize, set to prefs, zoom,
exclude, include, close tile cascading, and kill windows. You can cycle
screens.  WComm also has a title clock, a palette window (with up to 256
colours), a popup shell, and a notify system, which can inform you about
any important event and date, such as the birthdays of your friends, etc.
You may also automatically start any command, a backup for example, at
specific intervals.  WComm is controlled by some configuration files and
can be handled by the use of the several asynchronous windows.  Requires
AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.
