AmigaWorld
.description
A database program that contains information about every
country on Earth.  It enables you to have a look at the data
of one country, or to compare several ones.  Among other things
it displays location, capital, area, population, languages,
currency and the flag of each country.  AmigaWorld is very
easy to handle, and you can use it with your favourite font,
screen mode and colors.  You can also choose between English,
German, Swedish and Dutch output.  It works on every Amiga
that has one MByte of memory and Kickstart 1.2 or later.
New features include flag display and information about
religions and international organizations.
