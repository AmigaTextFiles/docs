BadLinks
.description
A utility which tests the links in newly written amigaguide
documents.  Rather than manually clicking on every button in
your amigaguide document to ensure each will link up with a
valid node, just run BadLinks.  Will work on documents which
reference nodes in other amigaguide documents too.
