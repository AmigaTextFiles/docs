.description
Provides up to 10 hotkeys using F1-F10 and your choice of qualifier.  The
advantage of using hotkeys as opposed to menu or docking programs etc, is
of course, that the keyboard is always available regardless of the screen
you are currently working in.  Compatible with both 1.3 and 2.x systems.
