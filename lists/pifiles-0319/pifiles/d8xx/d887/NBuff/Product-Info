Rewrite of A.C.R. Martin's original DBuff double-buffer routines from an
early library disk.  No more memory leaks nor misuse of MrgCop()! The
JACOsub video titler uses NBuff.  NBuff allows any number of video buffers,
not just two.  A single #define makes it fast and Intuition-unfriendly
(like DBuff) or friendly (which is a bit slower).  Another #define controls
whether NBuff will or will not use the Layers library for transparent,
automatic buffer boundary clipping.  PD, C source + binary demo.  Docs in
NBuff.c.
