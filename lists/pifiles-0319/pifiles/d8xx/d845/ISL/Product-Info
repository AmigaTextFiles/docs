Imagine Staging Language, a decompiler and compiler which allow the user to
create and modify Imagine staging files in a manner much more powerful than
that provided by Imagine itself.  Imagine is the 3d rendering and animation
program published by Impulse.  ISL does not require any particular version
of AmigaDos, but it only works with version 2.0 of Imagine.
