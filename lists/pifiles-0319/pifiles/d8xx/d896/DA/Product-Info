"Digital Aesthetics".  A program that provides you with a
soothing audio environment in which to work, similar to the
cd's/tapes available of rainstorms, ocean surfs, rivers, etc.
The sounds are contained in modules called "EMods", short for
Environment MODules.  With DA, you can control various aspects
of these EMods, and link EMods together in a list to be played
in sequence.  Two short EMods are provided, with more available
when you purchase the registered version.
