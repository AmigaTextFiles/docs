.description
A historical strategy game, that in spite of its high complexity is fast
and easy to play.  Fully mouse controlled with a fine zoomable map of the
Roman empire (overscan and interlaced options).  The simulation delivers
many historical insights because of its accuracy (may be used for
educational purposes) and is a challenging and entertaining game for two or
more players (also interesting for solitary studies).
