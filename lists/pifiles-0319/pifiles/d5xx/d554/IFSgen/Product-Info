An Iterated Function System generator.  Generates pictures of ferns, trees,
galaxies, snowflakes and many others using IFS codes (a type of fractal).
Features full mouse control of the functions which define the picture.
Just point the mouse at one of the parts of the shape and drag it around
the screen.  Fully menu driven, with the ability to load and save IFF
pictures and the codes that generate them.  Fine tune codes and move them
around the screen, zoom in and out and much more.  Lots of example files.
Written in AMOS and compiled so that you can run it from WorkBench.
Version 2.1 shareware version with saves disabled.  Requires 1 Mb of memory
or more.  Full source code available when you register.
