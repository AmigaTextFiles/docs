.description
Prints disk labels (for 3.5" and 5.25" disks), primarily for FD library
disks, with the ability to create, handle, load and save label library
files so labels for most FD disks are available after a few mouse clicks.
Features include different label sizes, intuition based directoryread-in,
label library functions and multiple print of any label or FD disk serie.
Works fine with every printer connected to the parallel port and AmigaOS
1.2/1.3/2.0.  Both English and German versions.
