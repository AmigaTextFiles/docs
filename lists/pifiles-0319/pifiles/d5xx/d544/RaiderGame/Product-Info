Raider 3DX is a classic space strategy game for X-Specs 3D.  Search for
enemy on a 3D map of the galaxy.  Warp transport to trouble spots and
protect the Federation bases.  Blast the enemy with your energy torpedoes.
But watch your own energy reserves since you are the last hope of the
galaxy.  Digitized sound.  Amazing 3D action.  Requires X-Specs 3D glasses.
