.description
Demo version of a very fast GIF viewer, that is three to fifteen times
faster than similar programs.  Currently TurboGIF produces very high
resolution black and white images only.  Makes an excellent "GIF previewer"
to decide if a particular GIF is worth spending the time converting with
one of the other converters.
