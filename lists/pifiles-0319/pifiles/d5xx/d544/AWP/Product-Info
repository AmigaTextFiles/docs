This program animates any wait pointer like the one in WorkBench 2.0.  It
installs a vertical blank interrupt to minimise CPU usage and is written
100% in assembler for maximum efficiency.  It uses two hands for the clock,
like it should be, and has nine different user selectable speeds.  Requires
AmigaOS 2.0.
