This is version 2.0 of GWIN restructured as an AMIGA shared library.  GWIN
or Graphics WINdow is an integrated collection of graphics routines
callable from C.  These routines make it easy to create sophisticated
graphics programs in the C environment.  One-line calls give you a custom
screen (ten types available), menu items, requestors, text, circles,
polygons, etc.  GWIN is a two-dimensional floating point graphics system
with conversion between world and screen coordinates.  GWIN includes
built-in clipping that may be turned off for speed.  Use of color and XOR
operations are greatly simplified.  Many examples of the use of GWIN are
included in an examples directory.  Examples include line/bar graph
program, SPICE 2G.6 graphics post-processor, and others.  Extensive
documentation is included.  This is an update to version 1.1 on disk 433.
