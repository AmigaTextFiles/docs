.description
A 'DMouse' type replacement that works with WorkBench 2.0 and fully
compatible with A3000 & accelerator boards.  Always retains the default
path and stack, and current directory.  Can automatically open CLI/SHELL
windows to 1 pixel less than the current screen size on opening.  New
functions include spline patterning on blanking, toggle freeze mouse, more
function keys, mouse activated screen shuffle, close gadgets on Shell
windows, and more as many users have requested.
