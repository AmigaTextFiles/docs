Removes all ANSI codes from a text file, so that only the bare text
remains.  It is useful for editing terminal program capture buffers.  Two
versions are provided: one for the command line (CLI) and one with a full
Intuition interface.  The Intuition version includes the ability to
selective strip certain ANSI codes, and generates a complete report.  And
includes full source in C.
