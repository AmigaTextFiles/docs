.description
A 'PopCLI' type replacement that works with WorkBench 2.0 and fully
compatible with A3000 & accelerator boards.  Always retains the default
path and stack, and current directory.  Can automatically open CLI/SHELL
windows to 1 pixel less than screen size on opening.  New functions include
spline patterning on blanking, more function keys, mouse activated screen
shuffle, close gadgets on Shell windows and more as many users have
requested.
