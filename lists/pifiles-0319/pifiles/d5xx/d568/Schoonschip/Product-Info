.description
A pioneering algebraic manipulation program which has been used in particle
physics and continuously developed since late 1963.  Not as friendly as
Mathematica or Maple, with no graphics or intuition interface and not as
much built in, but still a general purpose algebraic manipulation language.
Written in machine language to run fast and be memory efficient.  Capable
of handling large problems.  Includes large and small workspace versions,
tutorial examples, sample programs, and a comprehensive manual.
