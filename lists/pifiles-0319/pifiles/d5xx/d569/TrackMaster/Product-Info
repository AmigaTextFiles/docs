.description
A small tool to help game developers create selfbooting, trackdisk loading
gamedisks.  Trackmaster uses a script file to process datafiles (join,
compress, relocate, special actions).  The processed data is written to
disk via trackdisk.device.  A bootblock for the first datafile, which
should be a pc-relative loader, and a file look up table, is created and
written to disk.  Manual and source included.
