An integration of the AnalytiCalc spreadsheet (disk 495) and the RIM-5
relational database management system (disk 143).  Integrates a spreadsheet
with hundreds of functions and 18000 by 18000 cell address space, with a
complete disk based DBMS, and functions permitting one to move relations or
selections of relations in either direction between spreadsheet and
database.  In this way, large relations can be stored on disk, yet accessed
as needed in the spreadsheet, from whence they can be computed with or
plotted.  The command language of RIM is fairly close to SQL and documents
for it are included.  Also supports GnuPlot to provide flexible plotting.
A minimum of 2Mb of memory is recommended, of which 750K must be
contiguous.  Because the full distribution would not fit on a single disk,
it has been split onto two disks, with disk 593 containing the executable
and needed "keypad" command files, and disk 594 containing the source and
documentation.
