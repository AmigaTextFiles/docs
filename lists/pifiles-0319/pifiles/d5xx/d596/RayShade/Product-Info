.description
Rayshade is a ray tracing program ported to the Amiga from UNIX.
Rayshade's features include nine types of primitives (box, cone cylinder,
height field, plane, polygon, sphere, superquadric, flat triangle and
phong-shaded triangle); composite objects; point, directional, and extended
(area) light sources; solid procedural texturing and bump mapping of
primitives; antialiasing through adaptive supersampling; arbitrary linear
transformations on primitives; and more.  This is version 3.0 patchlevel 5
and includes sources in C.  The modifications for Amiga & SAS/C are
distributed as diff files.  Some example input files are also included.
