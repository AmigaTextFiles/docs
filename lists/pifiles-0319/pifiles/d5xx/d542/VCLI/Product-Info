associated with an Amiga CLI command that is executed when an incoming
voice command is recognized.  VCLI allows the execution of any Amiga CLI
command by voice.  Requires the Perfect Sound 3 audio digitizer.  This is
Version 2.0 of VCLI which offers improved performance, improved
operability, and improved graphics for voiceprint display.
