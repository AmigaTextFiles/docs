.description
Powerpacker Patcher is a small tool that patches the DOS library so that
PowerPacker datafiles will start acting as if they were "normal" files.
Sample use of PP would be to crunch all ".info" files.  The icons will
retain their functionality as long as PP is installed, and WB will never
know the difference.  Icons are useful, but take up a lot of valuable disk
space.  You may also use any text viewer, editor or IFF tool (or anything!)
you desire directly on Powerpacker files! Includes full source.
