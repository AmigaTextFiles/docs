A "Programmer's Workbench".  Allows you to easily and conveniently move,
copy, rename, and delete files & directories from a CLI environment.  Also
provides a method to execute either Workbench or CLI programs by
double-clicking them or by selecting them from a ParM like Menu with lots
of arguments.  A Browser 1.6 replacement, does everything Browser 1.6 does
and a lot more.
