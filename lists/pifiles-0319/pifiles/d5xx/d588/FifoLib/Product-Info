.description
FIFO: is like PIPE: but is based on fifo.library rather than its own
implementation.  Fifo.library is a general fifo library implementation that
supports named fifos, writing to a fifo from a hardware exception, multiple
readers on a fifo with each getting the same data stream, efficient
reading, and automatic or manual flow control.  Programs that require
non-blocking IO can access one side of a FIFO: connection via the
fifo.library instead of the FIFO: device.  Includes some source.
