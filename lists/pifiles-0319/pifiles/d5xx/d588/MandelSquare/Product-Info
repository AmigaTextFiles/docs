.description
Yet another program to generate images from the Mandelbrot set, different
from most implementations in that it runs only under AmigaOS 2.x, requires
an '020/'030/'040 CPU and a numerical coprocessor.  The calculation
routines were written in '881 assembly language for maximum speed and
precision.  Also included is a `movie mode' which allows generation of long
camera zooms to spots in the Mandelbrot set.  The resulting animations can
be saved in ANIM-opt-5 format, allowing to replay them using `MandelSquare'
or standard animation software.
