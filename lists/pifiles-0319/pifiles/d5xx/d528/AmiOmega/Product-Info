.description
Amiga port of the Omega game.  Omega is similar to hack or rogue, but is
much more complex.  There is a city, several towns, a wilderness, lots of
dungeons, a multitude of monsters, lots of spells, magic items, etc.  There
are several quests to complete.  All in all, it is an excellent game.  A
different port than version 1.0 on disk 320.
