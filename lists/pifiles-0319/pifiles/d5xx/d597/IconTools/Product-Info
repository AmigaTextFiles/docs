Tools to manage icons from the Workbench.
.description
Four programs to manage some aspects of icons using the Intuition 
interface, which allow one operate on many icons at once by 
shift-clicking.\n  
<<FloatIcon 1.05>> unsnapshots selected icons so that the Workbench can 
freely place them in a drawer window.\n  
<<ReplaceTool 2.04>> sets a new default tool for selected project icons.  
The default tool is either the first icon clicked on or is selected from a 
file requester.\n  
<<ReplaceImage 1.01>> changes the images of selected icons to that of the 
first icon clicked on.\n  
<<SwapColors 1.01>> swaps colors 1 and 2 in all selected icon images.\n  
The last two programs will be useful for converting to the "new look" of 
Workbench 2.0.\n
