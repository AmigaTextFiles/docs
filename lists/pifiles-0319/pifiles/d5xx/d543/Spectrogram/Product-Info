Displays a frequency spectrum of given audio data file.
.description
Amiga Spectrogram computes a frequency analysis of any 8 bit
audio data file and creates a high resolution color display
showing frequency content versus time.  Display color is
continuously adjustable.  This type of display when applied
to the human voice has been called a voiceprint. This tech-
nique has also been used to analyze sounds of many kinds of
animals including birds, dolphins, whales, etc.  The audio
data file can be replayed at any desired rate, giving a
simultaneous audio and visual representation of the sample.
A selection of interesting audio samples for analysis by
Amiga Spectrogram is included.
