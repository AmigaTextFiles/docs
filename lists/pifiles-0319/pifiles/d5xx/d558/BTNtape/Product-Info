.description
A "Better Than Nothing" SCSI tape device handler.  Provides flat file
access to a SCSI tape drive from application programs using simple DOS
calls to Read() and Write().  It can also be used with the Amiga TAR
utility for disk backups.  Requires a "SCSI-direct" compatible SCSI bus
adapter.  It fixes a number of bugs, and includes some new features such as
appending files to existing tapes.
