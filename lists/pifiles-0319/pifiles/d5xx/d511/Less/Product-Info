.description
A text file reader, descended from Unix "Less." Less has features found on
no other Amiga file reader; it can use pipes, accepts multiple filenames,
and has many convenient positioning commands for forward and backward
movement, marking positions, etc.  This version runs on all Amigas, under
any screen resolution and font, and uses the full 8-bit character set.
Other improvements include seaches using regular expressions, multiple file
selection from Workbench, and resident operation.
