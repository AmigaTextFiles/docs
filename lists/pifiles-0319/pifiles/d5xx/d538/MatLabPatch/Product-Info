Patches for both Matlab and Diglib on disk 499.  The version of Diglib
compiled for 68000 machines has some incorrectly compiled modules (compiled
for 68020) and therefore causes crashes on 68000 machines.  The Plot.sub
module compiled for 68000 machines in the Matlab archive was linked using
the incorrect Diglib and does not run on 68000 machines.  This update
provides correctly compiled replacements for both those files.
