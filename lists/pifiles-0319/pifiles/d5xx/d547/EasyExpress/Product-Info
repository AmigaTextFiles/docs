A compiler tool for the users of Charlie Gibbs' A68k assembler and The
Software Distillery's BLink.  EasyExpress does the same job better than
your batch file and is much easier to change for current use.  If you use
many object files, EasyExpress can make your life much easier.  You can do
almost everything via mouse and just watch how easily the compilation of
your program happens.
