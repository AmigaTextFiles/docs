DataPlot is a very special function "plotter".  It does not really plot the
data, but it creates a ".dat" file containing the function which you typed
in and the corresponding values that have been calculated.  The ".dat" file
can then be read in by "MultiPlot" (from AmigaLibDisk 467), so that you can
manipulate the data with much more powerful functions than most normal
function plotter programs offer.  Public Domain.  Source in C included.
