.description
A replacement for the Workbench 2.x `Format' command with many additional
features and a basic gadtools interface.  Can be made resident and sports a
number of additional command line options.  Also included is a code
fragment which will correctly initialize data media of any size (floppy
disks or hard disk partitions) which works both under Kickstart 1.2/1.3 and
2.x.  AmigaOS 2.x required.
