A tool which patches Workbench 2.x online to supply default icons for about
45 different file types ranging from LhArc archives to object code files.
Enhances the `Show All Files' option of Workbench which by default only
knows two types of file icons: Tool and Project.  If enabled scans all
files in a directory which do not have an icon file supplied and tries to
determine their file types.  When done, tricks Workbench into believing
that there are proper icons for these files in the directory.  AmigaOS 2.x
required.
