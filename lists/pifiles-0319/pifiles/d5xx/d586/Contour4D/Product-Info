.description
Creates colored, altitude mapped objects for Sculpt 4D.  Two IFF brushes
are used; one to supply the color for the object and a second which, by its
color intensity, gives an altitude for the object at that point.  Objects
are optimised so that large areas of one color and height become a single
larger set of faces.  Objects are output in Sculpt '.scene' format.  Works
with ordinary, HAM or Extra-Halfbrite brushes.  Any palette colors can be
omitted from conversion and all palette colors can be of different
textures.  Full Intuition interface.
