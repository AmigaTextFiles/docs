.description
A demonstration version of a commercial molecular graphics program.  Stick
representations of molecules may be rotated, translated and scaled on
screen and changes may be made to structures.  `Space filling' pictures may
also be generated using quick preview, shading, or ray-tracing. The
demonstration version allows only one of two structures to be displayed and
does not allow space filling, though some sample space-filled structures
are included.
