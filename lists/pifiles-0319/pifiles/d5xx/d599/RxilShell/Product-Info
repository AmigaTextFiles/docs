.description
A set of routines to form an additional layer between the programmer and
ARexx.  Rxil_shell sits on top of rxil on disk 299 and contains a few
changes and bug fixes to the rxil routines.  Using these routines, adding
ARexx support to a program becomes completely trivial.  Includes C source.
