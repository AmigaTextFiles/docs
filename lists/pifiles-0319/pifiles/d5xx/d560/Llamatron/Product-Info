.description
A fast, original rendering of the eighties 'Robotron' by Williams.  It
features over 100 levels, sampled sound, single player mode, 2-player team
and individual modes, droid-sidekick modes, 2-joystick console mode, dozens
of different, weird enemies and an abstract sense of humor.  Includes two
versions, a 512K version and a 1Mb version with better samples.  An update
to the copy on disk 541, which was also version 1.0, but was missing the
512K version file.
