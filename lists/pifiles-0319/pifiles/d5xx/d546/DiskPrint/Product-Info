.description
Prints disk labels (for 3.5" and 5.25" disks), primarily for FD library
disks, with the ability to create, handle, load and save label library
files so labels for most FD disks are available after a few mouseclicks.
Features include different label sizes, library files, directoryread-in,
direct disk contents read-in, label library functions and printing labels
for a whole serie of disks in one turn.  Works fine with every printer
connected to the parallel port.
