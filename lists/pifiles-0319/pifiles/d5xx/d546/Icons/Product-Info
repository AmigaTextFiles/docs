Two collections of high-quality, consistently designed icons for the Amiga
Workbench.  The color collections will require an 8 color Workbench (i.e.
Workbench 2.0).  The black and white collections are useable on any normal
4 color Workbench.  One set of icons is based on the icons supplied with
the GEM windowing system, and the other set is modeled after the icons on a
Silicon Graphics Personal Iris.  A bonus set of ray-traced icons is
included.
