Two programs for visualizing four-dimensional objects.  The Tesseract
program displays the three-dimensional projects of a hyper-cube
(tesseract), a hyper-octahedron or a hyper-tetrahedron.  These can be
rotated in three and four dimensions.  The 4D Navigator program moves you
through the three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere.  Source
