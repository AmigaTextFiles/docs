.description
A program that plots data and algebraic functions in 2D.  The user simply
clicks on an option screen to select various options, such as type of
marker, log or linear axis, auto vs manual scaling, grid lines.  The macro
language makes similar, repetitive plots easy to do.  Data points can be
transformed by an algebraic function prior to plotting.  A macro can be
automatically executed upon start-up.  Plots in any resolution from 320x200
to 640x400.  Plots can be saved as macro commands and IFF ILBM files.
Prints directly to Epson compatible printers, or to any Preferences
supported grapics printer via the PLT: device.  A significant upgrade to
version 1.0 on disk 121.
