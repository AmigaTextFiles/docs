.description
Text processor inspired by the Unix awk utility.  Bawk searches files for
specific patterns and performs actions for every occurance of these
patterns.  The patterns can be regular expressions.  The actions are
expressed using a subset of the C language.  Unfortunately this version
always gets a stack overflow no matter what the stack is set to, I haven't
had a chance to find the bug.  So you can hunt for it.  Looks like it could
be a very useful utility for the Amiga.
