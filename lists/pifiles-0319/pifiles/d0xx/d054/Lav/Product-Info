.description
This program displays the number of tasks in the Amiga's run queue,
sampled every second and averaged over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
This lets you see just how much (or how little) of the time that
something is using the Amiga's processor, and how many tasks are
queued to use it.

.restrictions
Uses Delay() which has been strongly implicated in causing floppy-disk
corruption in versions of the OS up to 1.3, due to a bug in
timer.device. Use on floppy-based systems running anything less than
2.0 is discouraged for this reason.
