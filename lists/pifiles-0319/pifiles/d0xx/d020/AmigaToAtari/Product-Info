.description
Source code for an Amiga to Atari ST object code format converter.  Takes
Amiga objects as input and produces Atari objects as output.  This allows
the Amiga to be used as a cross development machine providing the proper
libraries are available.  (Currently does not work, but I don't have an ST
to try it with anyway...)
