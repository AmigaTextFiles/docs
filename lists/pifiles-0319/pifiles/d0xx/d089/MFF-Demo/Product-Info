Demo copy of the MicroFiche Filer program from Software Visions Inc.  The
MicroFiche File is a full-powered database program for manipulation of
text, numbers, and pictures.  It uses the microfiche metaphor for dealing
with your data graphically.  This is a full production version except that
the save option has been disabled.  Includes a sample database of my disk
library.
