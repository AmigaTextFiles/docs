.description
Journal is a program that records a sequence of mouse and keyboard events
as they occur and stores them in a file.  The file can be played back with
another program, also supplied, which causes the same sequence of events to
occur again.  Very useful for creating demonstrations of programs or
documenting repeatable bugs.
