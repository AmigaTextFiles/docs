.description
Draco is a systems programming language of the author's design. The
compiler generates object code optimized to about the level of the
late 1980's commerical compilers. The linker produces stand-alone
programs. Draco include files for all Amiga functions in V1.3 are
included, as are all needed interface stubs plus a run-time library.
A multi-file, multi-window text editor is included. Sample programs
are included. Full documentation is included on Fish 77. There is a
V1.3 version of the compiler, which has not been properly distributed.
It offers more optimization and some language additions.
