This is an update to the compress version released on disk number 6.  It is
tested and seems to work well except for a couple glitches noticed at the
last minute (see the README file). Compress reduces the size of the named
files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding.  The amount of compression obtained
depends on the size of the input, the number of bits per code, and the
distribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code or
English is reduced by 50-60%.  Compression is generally much better then
that achieved by Huffman coding (as used in "pack") or adaptive Huffman
coding (as used in "compact"), and takes less time to compute.
