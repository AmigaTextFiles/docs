.description
An object-oriented drawing program.  Uses a small set of graphics
primitives (like "line", "box", and "text") and a small set of editing
functions (like "move", "size", and "rotate").  While drawing and editing,
the user can call on other functions to modify the display; to zoom in,
slide around, superimpose a grid, etc.  This shareware program was
submitted by the author.
