.description
A set of shareware tools, submitted by the author, to do various
manipulations on IFF images, including comparison of the color palettes of
a pair of IFF images, filtering an IFF image in various ways, producing a
color usage frequency chart for an IFF image, reducing the size of an IFF
image to produce a miniature to use as an icon, converting an icon to an
IFF image, and recoloring an IFF image using the palette of a second image,
in a least squared error fashion.
