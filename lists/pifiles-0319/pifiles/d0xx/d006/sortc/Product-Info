.description
A quicksort based sort program, using separate driver and sort modules.
Originally from a DECUS C distribution.  Claims to be fast, but when
operating entirely out of ram takes 93 seconds to sort its input file,
sort.c, while AmigaDos's sort takes only 43 seconds under the same
conditions.
