Tool to process the Amiga "hunk" loadfile format.  Collects code, data, and
bss hunks together, allows individual specification of code, data, and bss
origins, and generates binary file with format reminiscent of Unix "a.out"
format.  The output file can be easily processed by a separate program to
produce Motorola "S-records" suitable for downloading to PROM programmer.
