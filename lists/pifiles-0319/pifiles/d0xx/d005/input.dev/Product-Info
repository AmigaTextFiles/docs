In combination with hander.interface.asm (supplied), lets a user trap
keyboard or mouse events before they get to Intuition and if desired,
install new (phony/ generated/other-devices-mouse-simulations) into the
input stream.  Handler.interface.asm is needed to convert the calling
sequence performed by the input.task for the input stream management into
something that a C program can understand.
