.description
Text processor inspired by the Unix awk utility.  This is an update to the
copy released on disk 65.  Bawk searches files for specific patterns and
performs actions for every occurance of these patterns.  The patterns can
be regular expressions.  The actions are expressed using a subset of the C
language.
