Job Manager is a utility which extends the AmigaDos multitasking
environment by providing features such as: allocation of CPU cycles in any
ratio to multiple CPU bound processes, default task priorities based on
task name, task logging, system uptime reports, task CPU use and CPU %
reports, task invocation times, and more.  JM has very little impact on the
system itself.  Requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or later.  Includes 68000/20 and
68030/40 versions.
