DSound is an 8SVX sound sample player that plays samples directly off a
hard drive.  The sound sample is played as it is loaded, making it possible
to play sound samples of any length even under limited memory conditions.
This version fixes bugs and adds support for stereo samples and the playing
of mono samples out of both speakers.  In addition, DSound can now be made
resident.
