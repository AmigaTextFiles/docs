.description
A little program that patches the system requesters to use the similar
requesters in ReqTools.library.  It also patches the ARP requester and all
requesters in Req.library.  It is very flexible, allowing you to modify
where the requester should appear, which of the libraries to patch, etc.
Includes a pair of small utility programs, GetFile and ReqAsk, that can be
used in scripts to put up file requesters or other requesters.
