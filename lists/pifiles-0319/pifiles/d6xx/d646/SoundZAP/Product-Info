.description
A sound conversion utility that will convert almost any of the sampled
sound file formats available on different platforms to the Amiga's IFF 8SVX
format or into RAW data.  It recognizes .VOC, .au (ulaw, 16, 24, or 32 bit
samples), .WAV, and Macintosh headered samples, and converts them
appropriately. It can also identify ulaw, signed, and unsigned RAW data,
converting it properly.  It treats unidentifiable headered files as RAW, so
they are treated properly also.
