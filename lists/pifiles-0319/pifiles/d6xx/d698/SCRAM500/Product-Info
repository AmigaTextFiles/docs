The first of a series of Public Domain "KitWare" hardware projects for the
Amiga.  On this disk you will find the design for an 8Meg RAM and SCSI
controller for the Amiga 500 (SCsi RAM for the 500 = SCRAM 500).  You will
also find an order form to obtain PCB, chips and whatever you need to build
one.  The SCRAM 500 is easy to build, cheap and should be useful to a lot
of people.  Included in this distribution is complete documentation on how
to assemble a SCRAM 500, notes for Amiga 1000 owners, a description of the
custom chips, design notes, troubleshooting guide, user's manual, bill of
materials, 12 HPGL plot files for schematics and PCB layout, hard drive
partitioning software, a mountable device driver, a ROMable driver, and
more!
