Alternative pipe handler (incl. source)
.description
The `APipe-Handler' allows you to add the `APIPE:' DOS device to your
system.  This device acts as a pipe between two programs, but in a
different manner than the standard `PIPE:' device does.  This handler
interprets the text after the `APIPE:' prefix as a command line
to execute, and the process/command which opens the file indicated
by the mention of `APIPE:' can now read the standard output or write
the standard input of the program indicated by the command line
depending on whether the `APIPE:' file was opened for reading or
writing, respectively.   Thus, the opening an `APIPE:' file is analogous
to the UNIX `popen()' call, but it is more widely available to the user.\n
Complete source is included and can be used as an example of a handler.
