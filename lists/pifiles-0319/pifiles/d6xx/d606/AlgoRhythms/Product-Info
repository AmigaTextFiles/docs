.description
An algorithmic composition program that improvises music over a MIDI
interface connected to the serial port.  A MIDI interface and synthesizer
are needed.  The music is simple but can be pretty.  Now on its own 8 color
screen, with 20 voices and more scales, AlgoRhythms saves its own output to
standard MIDI files, and can play 330 notes/sec on a 68000 at 7MHz.  Does
not use Amiga audio.  And sample data files.
