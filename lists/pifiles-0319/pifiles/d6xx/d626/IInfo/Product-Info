.description
A replacement for the DOS 'Info' command, written in assembly.  This
program has a similar output format and takes the same parameters.  It has
the added advantage of including maximum filesize in bytes that will fit on
a disk.  Coded in optimized assembly language, it is smaller than the
original DOS command.
