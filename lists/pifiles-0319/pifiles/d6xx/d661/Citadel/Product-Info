A full featured Amiga BBS program with all the necessary files to setup
your own BBS.  Citadel is a room structured message system with the
fundamental design goal of providing a congenial forum conducive to
interesting discussions.  Messages are stored and retrieved in
chronological order within each room.  Callers may travel freely between
the rooms, reading old messages and posting new ones.  This is part one of
a two part distribution.  Part two is on disk 662.  Both parts are
required.  Source available from authors.
