.description
An easy to use Amiga library which gives you some powerful routines for
dealing with IFF files, especially ILBM files (pictures), ANIM files
(animations), and 8SVX files (digitized sounds).  It is written completely
in assembler and is just 3Kb.  And binaries for several example programs
that use the library.
