.description
A program which will read tracks directly from your floppy disk, compress
them using adaptive huffman encoding, and output them to a file.  The
resulting file can be used by lhwarp to reconstruct an image of the
original disk.  New features include much faster compression/decompression,
a 32-bit CRC, and two additional compression methods.
