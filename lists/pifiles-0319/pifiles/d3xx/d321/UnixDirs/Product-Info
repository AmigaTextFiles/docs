.description
A program which intercepts calls to dos.library to add the UNIX style '.'
and '..' syntax for current and parent directories, respectively, to file
and path names.  I.E., you can refer to files in the current directory as
'./foo' and files in the parent directory as '../foo', or any combination
of the two.
