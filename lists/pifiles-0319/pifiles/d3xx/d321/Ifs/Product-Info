.description
An Iterated Function System viewer which graphically displays iterated
function systems and allows the user to interactively create the affine
functions that define such systems.  An IFS can represent complex pictures
very compactly.  Simple IFSs can describe an infinite number of different
and interesting fractal displays.  Includes a number of displays that the
author and others have discovered.
