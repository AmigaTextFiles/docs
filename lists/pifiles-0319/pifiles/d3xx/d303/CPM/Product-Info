.description
A program to compute mandelbrots via the Continous Potential Method, as
described in the book "The Science of Fractal Images" by H. O. Pietgen and
D. Saupe.  It is used to make 3-dimensional pictures of the mandelbrot set.
This is a batch mode type program so several images can be generated, one
after the other, without any human interaction.
