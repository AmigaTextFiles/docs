.description
MemGuard is a MemWatch-like program which has been rewritten in assembly
language for maximum speed and efficiency. Unlike MemWatch MemGuard does
not run as Task in a dummy loop but rather as a low-level interrupt routine
which is capable of trapping memory thrashing even before exec might know
of it and even while task switching is forbidden. In fact the low-memory
area is checked each frame. Virtually no processing time is wasted, the
interrupt routine does the check in about half a raster scan line's time.
This program was contributed by Ralf Thanner, who spent three weeks
programming & debugging it.  In this program Ralf uses some very delicate
tricks to let his interrupt routine work with Intuition alerts.
