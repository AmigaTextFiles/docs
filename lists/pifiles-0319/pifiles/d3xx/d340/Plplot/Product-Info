.description
A library of C functions useful for scientific plotting on the Amiga.  The
library is Lattice C compatible.  Contour plotting, three dimensional
plotting, axis redefinition, log-log plotting and multiple subpages are a
few of Plplot's features.  The plots can be displayed on a monitor or sent
to a graphics file for subsequent printing.  This version includes a
greatly improved intuition interface, preferences support for hardcopy,
several new device drivers, and the capability of adding additional device
drivers easily.
