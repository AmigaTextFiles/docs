.description
Trip planner program to find "best road route" between any two points of
travel.  Features include the user customization of CITIES and ROADS files
to suit travel interests and provision for very large city menus and
itineraries.  Also includes RoadScan, a checker for RoadRoute files (CITIES
and ROADS).  Very large files may contain goofs (cities with no roads, the
same road entered twice, etc.), or oddities (direct road not as fast as
multipoint).  These are pointed out, together with areas where users might
wish to make economies in the data base.
