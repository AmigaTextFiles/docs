.description
Graphs linear functions in two dimensions, similiar to a Mandelbrot plot.
You start with a linear function like 10sin(x**2+y**2) and CPlot treats
each point on the screen as an X-Y coordinate, color-scaling it according
to its magnitude for a preset range of inputs.  Includes some very nice
sample creations.
