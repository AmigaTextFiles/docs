.description
A "tryware" version of a mountable MS-DOS file system for the Amiga.  This
is a software product that allows you to read and write MS-DOS/PC-DOS and
Atari ST formatted disks (Version 2.0 or higher) directly from AmigaDOS.
This tryware version is a "readonly" version, which does not allow any
writes to the disk.  A fully functional version is available for a very
reasonable price from CONSULTRON.
