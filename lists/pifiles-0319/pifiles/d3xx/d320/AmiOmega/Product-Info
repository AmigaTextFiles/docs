Amiga port of the Omega game.  Omega is similar to hack or rogue, but is
much more complex.  There is a city, several towns, a wilderness, lots of
dungeons, a multitude of monsters, lots of spells, magic items, etc.  There
are several quests to complete.  All in all, it is an excellent game.
Requires 1Mb or more of memory.  Amiga version 1.0.
