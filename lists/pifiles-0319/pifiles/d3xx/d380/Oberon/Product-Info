A freely distributable demo version of a powerful Oberon compiler.  Oberon
is a modern, object oriented language developed by Prof. Dr. Niklaus Wirth
of ETH Zürich in Switzerland as a successor to Modula-2.  This single pass
compiler creates standard Amiga object files, uses a large variety of
optimizations to create fast code, supports writing of reentrant programs,
allows you to call code from other languages like C and Assembler, etc.
The package includes the compiler, an editor, a link utility, a program to
display compilation errors and some demo programs.
