.description
You must guide a lunar lander to ferry cargo from an orbiting space station
to bases on the surface of the moon.  You get cargo and fuel for the lander
by docking with the space station.  The goal is to complete all the
assigned cargo deliveries, and to destroy as few landers as possible in
doing so.
