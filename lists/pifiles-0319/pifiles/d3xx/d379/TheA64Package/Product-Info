A comprehensive emulator/utility package to assist Commodore 64 users in
upgrading to the Amiga.  According to the author, this package compares to
or surpasses the commercially available packages of the same nature.  Many
of the utilities require a hardware interface that allow the Amiga to
access C64 peripherals such as disk drives and printers.  The hardware
interface is free with a shareware donation to the author.
