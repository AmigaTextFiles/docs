A utility providing a simple calendar which can hold and show appointments.
It may be useful in managing your time.  Its chief goals were to provide
day, week and month at a glance for any date between 1/1/0001 and
12/31/9999, defaulting to the current date.  It is menu driven and fairly
easy to use.
