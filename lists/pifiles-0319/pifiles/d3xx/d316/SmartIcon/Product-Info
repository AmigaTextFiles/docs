.description
This shareware program, submitted by the author, is an Intuition objects
iconifier.  Version 2.0 is still limited to iconifying windows, which is
still very handy.  It adds a new "iconify gadget" to each window, that when
clicked on, iconifies the window into an icon in the ram: disk.  This is
version 2.0.
