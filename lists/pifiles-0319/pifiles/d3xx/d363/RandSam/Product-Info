Plays random soundsamples at random times, with random volume, random
cycles, and a bit random period.  It will definitely catch the attention of
the unsuspecting Amiga user (particularly one that has the stereo turned
up!) when a lion suddenly roars as they're typing away on their favorite
word processor! User modifiable start-up configuration file.  Include
source and some sample sounds.
