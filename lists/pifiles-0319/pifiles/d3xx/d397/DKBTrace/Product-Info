.description
A complete ray tracer that supports arbitrary quadric surfaces (spheres,
ellipsoids, cones, cylinders, planes, etc.), constructive solid geometry,
and various shading models (reflection, refraction, marble, wood, and many
others).  It also has special case code to handle spheres, planes,
triangles, and smooth triangles.  By using these special primitives, the
rendering can be done much more quickly than by using the more general
quadrics.  This is version 2.0 and includes source in C.
