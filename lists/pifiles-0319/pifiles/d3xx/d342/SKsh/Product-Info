A ksh-like shell for the Amiga.  Some of its features include command
substitution, shell functions with parameters, aliases, local variables,
local functions, local aliases, powerful control structures and tests,
emacs style line editing and history functions, I/O redirection, pipes,
large variety of built-in commands, Unix style wildcards, Unix style
filename conventions, filename completion, and coexistence with scripts
from other shells.  Very well documented.  New features include a "tiny"
version, a working case construct, support for resident commands, smaller
