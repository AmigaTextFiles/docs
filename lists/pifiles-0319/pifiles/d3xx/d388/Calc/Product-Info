A shell style, command-line calculator.  Calc does not have a fancy keypad
display as many other calculator programs do.  Instead, it is capable of
taking its input from a file, the keyboard, or a command line and
outputting its results to a file or the screen.  It can also apply a single
equation to all of the values stored in a file (or files).  It handles all
common mathematical expressions, can optionally predefine physical
constants and store variables.
