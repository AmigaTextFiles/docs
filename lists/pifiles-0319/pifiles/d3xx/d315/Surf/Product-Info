Generates bezier surfaces of revolution.  Will produce some amazing
pictures of wineglasses, doorknobs, or other objects one could turn on a
lathe.  Includes the capacity to map IFF image files onto any surface that
it can draw.  Changes include support for data file formats that can be
translated to input files for various 3D modeling programs, an increase in
the number of grey shades available, and the capability of modifying the
endpoints of segments.  Source included.
