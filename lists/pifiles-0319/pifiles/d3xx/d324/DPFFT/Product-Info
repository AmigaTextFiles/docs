An enhanced version of DPlot from disk 290.  DPlot is a simple display
program for experimental data, with the goals of supporting paging through
lots of data and providing comfortable scaling and presentation.  The
enhancements for DPFFT include addition of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT),
display of a customized amplitude and phase spectrum, a prewhitening
capability, and a Welch window for spectral smoothing.
