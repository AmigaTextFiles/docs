.description
A game based on computer programming.  Unlike arcade type games which
require human input controlling some object, all strategy in CRobots is
condensed into a C language program that you design and write, to control a
robot whose mission is to seek out, track, and destroy other robots, each
running different programs.  All robots are equally equipped, and up to
four may compete at once.  Source available from author.
