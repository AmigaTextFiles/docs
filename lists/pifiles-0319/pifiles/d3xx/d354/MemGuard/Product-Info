.description
MemGuard is a MemWatch like program which has been rewritten in assembly
language for maximum speed and efficiency.  Unlike MemWatch, MemGuard does
not run as task in a dummy loop but rather as a low-level interrupt routine
which is capable of trapping memory trashing even before exec might know of
it and even while task switching is forbidden.
