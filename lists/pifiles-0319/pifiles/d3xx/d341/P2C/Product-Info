P2C is a tool for translating Pascal programs into C.  It handles the
following Pascal dialects: HP Pascal, Turbo/UCSD Pascal, DEC VAX Pascal,
Oregon Software Pascal/2, Macintosh Programmer's Workshop Pascal,
Sun/Berkeley Pascal.  Modula-2 syntax is also supported.  Most reasonable
Pascal programs are converted into fully functional C which will compile
and run with no further modifications.  This is version 1.13 and includes
source.
