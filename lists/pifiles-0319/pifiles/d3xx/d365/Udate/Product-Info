Udate is a replacement for the AmigaDOS date command, containing many
options similiar to the UNIX date command.  Udate will allow you to set the
date and time via prompts or directly from the command line, will display
any part of the date or time using the options in any color desired, and
will also make an automatic adjustment of your system clock for Daylight
Savings Time so your computer will be one less clock you will ever have to
set twice a year for DST.  Update to version on disk #311, this version is
slightly smaller and works correctly with the 68030.
