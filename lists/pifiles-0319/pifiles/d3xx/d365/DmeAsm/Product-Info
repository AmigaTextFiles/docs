.description
A utility for those who use Matt Dillon's Dme editor and HighSoft's DevPac
Assembler.  DmeAsm is a CLI command file that takes your source code as a
parameter and opens a window similar to the Assemble window inside Devpac
(Genam2) and gives similar options.  If no parameter is supplied then the
window will still open and you can supply your own.
