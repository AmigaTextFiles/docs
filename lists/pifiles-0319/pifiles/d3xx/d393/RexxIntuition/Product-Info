This is a ARexx function library that allows you to open windows/screens
from an ARexx script, attach menus, gadgets, (file) requesters, load and
save ILBM picture files, auto-requesters, print text and graphic dumps, and
completely interact with the user in an intuition environment.  Adds all of
those Amiga features that ARexx lacks.
