An Amiga port of the Fuzzy PixMap image manipulation library.  This package
allows manipulation and conversion of a variety of color and B&W image
formats.  Supported formats include Sun rasterfiles, GIF, IFF, PCX, PBM
bitmaps, "face" files, and FBM files.  Also has input converters for raw
images, like DigiView files, and output converters for PostScript and
Diablo graphics.  Besides doing format conversion, some of the other image
manipulation operations supported include rectangular extraction, density
and contrast changes, rotation, quantization, halftone grayscaling, edge
sharpening, and histograms.
