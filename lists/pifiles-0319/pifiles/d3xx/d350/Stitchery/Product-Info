This shareware program loads in IFF images and creates charted patterns
from them for use in counted cross-stitch and other forms of needlework.
It requires one megabyte of memory to run, and works best with a good
high-resolution printer for printing the patterns.  The Stitchery was
written with The Director and the Projector is included.
