.description
Two utilities that deal with disk tracks.  TCopy copies one or more tracks
from one disk to another, and is useful for copying part of a floppy disk
into RAD: during bootup.  TFile creates a dummy file which "marks" a
specified range of tracks, preventing AmigaDOS from using them and allowing
them to be used for raw trackdisk data.  Includes C source.
