.description
A viruskiller which checks for certain conditions indicating possible virus
infection.  Different from other programs of this kind, Berserker does not
rely on checksums only, it will also check the possible virus behind the
altered checksum.  Therefore even new viruses with old infection methods
can be traced and resident tools are not touched.
