.description
Scans through an IFF file, identifying the elements.  Faster than standard
utility IFFCheck since it uses Seek, but does not do IFFCheck's detailed
format checking.  Intended for use as a "template" from which programmers
can code their specific application.  For example, an expanded version has
been used to extract instrument data from music files.
