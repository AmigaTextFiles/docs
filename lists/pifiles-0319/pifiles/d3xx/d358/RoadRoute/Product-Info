.description
Revision of trip planner program to find "best road route" between any two
points of travel.  The user is encouraged to customize files CITIES and
ROADS to suit travel interests.  An update to the original version on disk
251, and makes provision for very large city menus and itineraries.  You
might like to use files from disk 328 (Mayes/Delzer).  Also includes
RoadScan, a checker for RoadRoute files (CITIES and ROADS).  Very large
files may contain goofs (cities with no roads, the same road entered twice,
etc.), or oddities (direct road not as fast as multipoint).  These are
pointed out, together with areas where users might wish to make economies
in the data base.
