.description
Parts 1 and 2 of a complete C manual for the Amiga which describes how to
open and work with Screens, Windows, Graphics, Gadgets, Requesters, Alerts,
Menus, IDCMP, Sprites, VSprites, AmigaDOS, Low Level Graphics Routines,
Hints and Tips, etc.  The manual also explains how to use your C Compiler
and gives you important information about how the Amiga works and how your
programs should be designed.  The manual consists of 15 chapters together
with more than 100 fully executable examples with source code.  When
unpacked, the manual and examples nearly fill up four standard Amiga
floppies.  Because of its size, it is distributed on two library disks,
parts 1 and 2 on disk 456 and parts 3 and 4 on disk 457.
