.description
The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of text
files. RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging, identification,
and merging of revisions. RCS is useful for text that is revised
frequently, for example programs, documentation, graphics, papers,
form letters, etc.  This is an update to RCS version 1.2 on disks 281
and 282, and includes only the files that have changed.
