.description
A very compact version of the popular utility for starting a CLI process in
the background, without preventing the CLI window from closing.  This
version is pure and only 468 bytes long.  Requires the NULL: device, which
is included.  Using NULL: makes it more flexible and robust than older
RunBacks.  Can optionally delay up to nine seconds after starting the
command.
