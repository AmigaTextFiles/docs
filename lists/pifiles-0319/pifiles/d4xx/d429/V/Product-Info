.description
A front-end for Commodore's More or some other text viewer that can be made
resident.  Can be used from Workbench, greatly reducing disk loading time
because V is much smaller than More, which need not be loaded if it is
resident.  From CLI, causes More to create a new window, specified with an
environment variable, rather than using the CLI window.  V is itself
residentable.  Much improved since the version on disk 224, to which it is
only distantly related.
