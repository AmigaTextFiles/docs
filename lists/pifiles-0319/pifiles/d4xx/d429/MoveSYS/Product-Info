Includes source in C.
.description
Reassigns SYS:, C:, S:, L:, LIBS:, DEVS:, and FONTS: to a new disk or
directory in one step.  Can be used from CLI or Workbench; just click it
and shift-double-click a disk or drawer icon.  More flexible and robust
than some other programs written for the same purpose.  It's small and
pure.  Second release (the one on disk 224 worked from CLI only).
