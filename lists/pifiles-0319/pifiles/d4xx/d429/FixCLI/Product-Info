.description
A tiny pure command which fixes problems with CLI's not created by other
CLI processes.  A new CLI or Shell created by such programs as PopCLI or
DMouse gets no path and no current directory.  FixCLI very quickly and
efficiently gives a path to a CLI that does not have one (it looks for
other processes that have valid paths) and sets the current directory as
specified if none is already set.  Put it in your S:Shell-Startup script.
