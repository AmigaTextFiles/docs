.description
Another alternative CLI directory lister command.  This one features
extreme optimization for speed, a variety of output formats, hiding of
.info files by default, and AmigaDOS pattern matching.  It is pure
(residentable).  It is intended to outperform all other directory listers.
Includes the additional utilities ForEvery and Whichever.  Release 1.2.
