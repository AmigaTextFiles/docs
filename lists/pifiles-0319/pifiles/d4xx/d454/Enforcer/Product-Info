Enforcer uses the MMU to build a shroud of protection over anything that is
not legal memory.  Any empty holes in the address space are marked as
illegal.  Reads of the system ROMs are allowed, but not writes.  With the
exception of longword reads of location 4, the lowest 1K of memory is
completely protected.  When an illegal access is detected, the power LED
will flash and a detailed message will be sent out the serial port.
