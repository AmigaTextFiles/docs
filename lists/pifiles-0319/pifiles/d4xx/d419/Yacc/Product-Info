.description
This is a port of Berkeley Yacc for the Amiga.  This Yacc has been made as
compatible as possible with the AT&T Yacc, and is completely public domain.
Note that it is NOT the so-called Decus Yacc, which is/was simply a
repackaging of the proprietary AT&T Yacc.  This is an update to the version
on disk 299.
