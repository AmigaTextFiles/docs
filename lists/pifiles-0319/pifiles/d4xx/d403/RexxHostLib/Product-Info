.description
This is a shared library package to simplify the ARexx host
creation/management procedure.  Rexx-message parsing is also included
making it possible to control ARexx from programs such as AmigaBASIC (can
you imagine AmigaBASIC controlling AmigaTeX?).  Differences include a few
bug fixes and new functions.
