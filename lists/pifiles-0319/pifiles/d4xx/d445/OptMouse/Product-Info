A program which allows you to use a Mouse Systems M3 serial mouse on the
Amiga and instructions which allow a serial mouse to be modified to plug
directly into the Amiga mouse port.  Useful as an example of how to "fake"
mouse movements and may be of use in writing drivers for digitizers, light
pens, and the like.
