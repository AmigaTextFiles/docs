A Workbench 2.0-aware DU clone (a program which determines the number of
disk blocks used by the contents of a directory and its child directories).
Unlike other Amiga DU programs, this will skip over links to files and links
to directories.  Not only does this give a more accurate representation of
how much space the contents of a particular directory are taking up, it
also prevents infinite loops when a directory has a link to one of its
ancestors.
