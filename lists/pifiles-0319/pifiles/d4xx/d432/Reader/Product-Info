.description
A program to scan a word list to locate which words can be made from the
letters given.  Allows matching of words by length and by giving the
letters known, ie. m.t.h for the word MATCH.  Great for word games and
crosswords.  Results output to screen and a RAM: based file.  The word list
is in ascii and so can be edited if desired.  New words can be added and it
could be used for different languages if required.  Supplied with over
24,200 words (mostly English spellings).
