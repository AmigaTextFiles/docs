.description
A Programmable Array Logic (PAL) program based on an old MMI Fortran IV
program from the 'PAL Handbook' Second Edition and Third Edition by MMI.
This Version (1.00) is completely rewritten for Fortran 77.  The outputs
produced are sent to separate files instead of the screen.  There are
plenty of example PAL files to test, inspect, or just to learn what PAL's
are all about.  The Fortran source is included with the instructions to
compile using AC/Fortran version 2.3.
