GWIN or Graphics WINdow is an integrated collection of graphics routines
callable from C.  These routines make it easy to create sophisticated
graphics programs in the C environment.  One line calls give you a custom
screen (ten types available), menu items, requestors, text, circles,
polygons, etc.  GWIN is a two dimensional floating point graphics system
with conversion between world and screen coordinates.  GWIN includes built
in clipping that may be turned off for speed.  Use of color and XOR
operations are greatly simplified.  Many examples of the use of GWIN are
included in an examples directory, including a line/bar graph program,
geographic mapping program, SPICE 2G.6 graphics post processor, and others.
Extensive documentation is included.  Recompiled to be compatible with MANX
Aztec C Release 5.
