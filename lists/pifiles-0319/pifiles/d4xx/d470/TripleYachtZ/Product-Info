.description
An implementation and variation of the game "Yacht".  Plays both Single
(the standard game) and Triple, which differs from normal Yacht-Z in that
all scores in the 3rd column of your scorecard are worth three times as
much as the normal value and those in the 2nd are worth double.  Source
