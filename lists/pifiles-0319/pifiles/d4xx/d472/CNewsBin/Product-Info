This is part 1 of a C News distribution for the Amiga.  This part includes
all the binary and text files necessary to set up and run C News.  Part 2
is available on disk 473 and contains the source.  C News uses UUCP, such
as Matt Dillons implementation (see disks 479 and 480) or that included
with this software's previous version (disk 319).  This package has been
reworked and now includes a newsreader, AmigaRN (Sharware).  All major (and
a few minor) features of Unix C News are implemented.  The Author refers to
this as release 15-Dec-90, an update to the orginal version on disks 318
and 319.
