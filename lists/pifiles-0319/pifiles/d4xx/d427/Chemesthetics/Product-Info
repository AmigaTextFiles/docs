.description
Chemesthetics is a program that draws molecules using the calotte model.
This means that atoms are drawn as bowls.  Using this model, even extremely
dangerous molecules like dioxine look quite nice.  Chemesthetics has a
fully intuitionized user interface and pictures can be saved as IFF
graphics files.
