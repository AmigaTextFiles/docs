.description
A program similar to MemWatch, which continually checks the low memory
vector table for random trashing.  Has been optimized and greatly enhanced
to support the 68010, 68020, 68030, etc. microprocessors.  Unlike MemWatch,
MemGuard does not run as task in a dummy loop but rather as a low level
interrupt routine which is capable of trapping memory trashing even before
exec might know of it, and even while task switching is forbidden.
