.description
The AnalytiCalc spreadsheet, directly executable.  This version features
operation with only one window, many "3 dimensional" sheet addressing
primitives, and optional execution from icons.  Two images are furnished,
one for smaller and one for large internal storage (though both have
software virtual memory if needed).  These images operate OK under AmigaDos
1.2, 1.3, and 2.0.  They include code allowing the spreadsheet to be
treated as a series of "pages" so that a cell has a row, column, and
(optionally) page, and ranges can be in depth along pages as well as along
rows or columns.  The mapping is flexible enough so that it can be used to
facilitate computing traces of matrices if desired, as well as for more
conventional use.
