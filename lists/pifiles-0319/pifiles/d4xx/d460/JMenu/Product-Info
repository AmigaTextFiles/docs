This program allows an AmigaDOS script to display a menu, wait for the user
to make a selection either with the mouse or the keyboard, and return the
selection back to the script through an environment variable.  It can also
immediately execute any valid AmigaDOS command based upon the menu
selection.  The maximum size of the menu is based on the screen resolution
and font size, up to a maximum of 26 selections of a maximum of 80
characters each and an optional title area of up to 4 lines.
