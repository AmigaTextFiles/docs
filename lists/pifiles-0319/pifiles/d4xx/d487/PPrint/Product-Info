.description
A printing utility, designed for all those who slowly but surely become
frustrated with programmers who think that they can do a form feed better
than their printer can.  This one relies on the printer itself to do the
formatting, and on the program to send the settings.  Features include a
full icon driven user interface, the ability to convert tabs to any size,
and the ability to save a number of standard settings.
