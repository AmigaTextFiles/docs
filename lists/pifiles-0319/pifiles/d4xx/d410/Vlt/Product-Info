.description
VLT is both a VT100 emulator and a Tektronix (4014 plus subset of 4105)
emulator, currently in use at SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center).
Although the VT100 part was originally based on Dave Wecker et al.'s VT100,
many enhancements were made.  Features include use of ARP, an ARexx port,
XMODEM 1K/CRC and Kermit protocols, support for additional serial ports,
external file transfer protocols (XPR), a "chat" mode, and
scrollback/review/history buffer.  It comes in two versions, one with
Tektronix emulation, and one without.  The Tektronix emulation allows
saving IFF files, PostScript files, and printing bitmaps to the printer.
