This utility speeds up your windowing environment.  The OpenWindow vector
is patched.  When someone tries to open a window in the workbench screen,
the lower refreshbit in the nw_Flags field is cleared.  This way, only
NOCAREREFRESH windows will be opened, resulting in faster window movements.
Windows opened in customscreens are not affected.  Assembly source
included.
