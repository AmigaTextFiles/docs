.description
A completely public domain file requester which may be used in any program,
even commercial ones.  It uses dynamically allocated memory to hold the
file names so the only limitation is the amount of memory available.
Includes a filter option to limit display of filenames to only ones with a
specific extension.  Names are automatically sorted while they are being
read and displayed.  This version has been enhanced by Bernd Schied for
more device gadgets, renaming of files and directories, ANSI-C source, and
more.  Update to version 1.10 on disk 336.
