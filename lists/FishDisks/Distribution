			   Distribution
			(Revised 12/24/90)


General

	To the best of my knowledge, materials in this library are
	freely redistributable, which means that they can be redistributed
	without special permission from the author.  However, any
	redistributors assume full liability for their own distributions.
	I do not guarantee the distribution status of the material or
	assume any liability for any such redistribution.

Selection Criteria

	Material in this library was selected as "freely redistributable"
	because it met one or more of the following conditions:

	(1)	The materials contains explicit copyright notices
		permitting redistribution.

	(2)	The materials were posted to a publically accessable
		electronic bulletin board and did not contain any copyright
		notice limiting distribution.  (Such materials will be
		removed if it is subsequently shown that copyright notices
		were illegally removed.)

	(3)	The materials were posted to a widely disseminated
		electronic network (such as usenet), thus implying that
		their author/poster intended them to be freely distributed.
		This applies only if they contain no notice limiting
		distribution.

	(4)	The materials contain an explicit notice placing them in the
		public domain.  This is not the same as condition (1).

	(5)	The materials were submitted to me directly by the author
		with a request to consider them for inclusion in the library.

Compilation Copyright Disclaimer

	In general, anyone who compiles a collection of information, such
	as this library, may place a special copyright on the collection
	itself, commonly refered to as a compilation copyright.  I have
	explicitly disclaimed any such copyright on this library.  It is
	not necessary to contact me for permission to redistribute this
	library in any form.
