Amiga hits from the first hour

Here are some of the games from the first years of the Amiga.
These games made the Amiga what it became - the #1 selling
home computer from 1988-1991.

They are inferior to newer games, but they were state-of-the-art
when they were released.

I only included those games that work fine on newer Amigas and
from harddisk. For some real classics you have to turn on your
old Amiga 500 and play them from floppy.

worth playing.
