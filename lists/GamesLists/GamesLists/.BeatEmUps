Beat em ups on the Amiga

This started as a complete list of all Amiga beat em up
games with a 2 player modus, but I soon realized that there
were more of them published than I thought. So I guess this
list will not be complete, but I am working on it, so
if you want to add something, please contact me.

The king of the classic beat em up games on the Amiga is, 
in my opinion, Shadow Fighter AGA. A really fantastic game.
17 different fighters, good graphics, superb gameplay,
harddisk installation possible - What can you expect more?
This game does not have to hide itself from any game on any
platform.
