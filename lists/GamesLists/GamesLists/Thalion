A tip for fans of some special Thalion games:

After Thalion went bankrupt in 1994 the programmers, gfx artists and
musicians went to other game companies where they were involved in
new games. So there were other games from other companies that look
and "feel" (play) like Thalion ones. Here are just a few examples:

- The English branch of Thalion (Thalion UK) developed the CD-ROM
  game "X-Fighter" in 1995 for Amiga.
  I dunno if it was ever released, though.
- Psygnosis released the Jump'n'Run game "The Misadventures of Flink"
  in 1995. It is from the same guys (Erwin Kloibhofer and Henk
  Nieborg) who made "Lionheart" and so it looks and plays a bit like
  this great classic.
- The team behind "Amberstar" and "Ambermoon" (Erik Simon,...) went
  to BlueByte and made in 1995 the wonderful RPG "Albion" - the
  development started on an A1200 but unfortunately the game was
  released for PC only... :-(
- In 1995 KoronaSoft released the "Approach Trainer" and the company
  Games4Europe released in 1996 the "Airbus A320 Vol. 2". Both games
  were programmed by Rainer Bopf, the guy who also made the first two
  Airbus games.
  The games look completely like the old ones and so are probably
  only something for real fans.
