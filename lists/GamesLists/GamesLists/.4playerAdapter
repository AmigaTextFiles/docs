4-Player Adapter


The 4-Player adapter makes it possible to attach (and use) 4 Joysticks
on the Amiga. Here is a list of all (?) games that support it.



Hired Guns (Psygnosis), a fantastic Sci-Fi role playing game in
the style of the classic Dungeon Master.

Dynablaster (Hudson Soft), the Amiga version of the famous
Bomberman. Great action game, fifth player uses the keyboard.

Blitzbombers, a new PD Dynablaster clone (get it from the
Aminet).

Great Courts 2, Blue Bytes tennis simulation

Subtrade (Century), the inofficial Amiga MULE conversion.

Kick Off II (Anco), a good soccer game, although inferior to
Sensible Soccer, IMHO.

Over the Net (Linel), a good Beach Volley simulation.

Leatherneck, an old and sensless shoot em up.

Super Skidmarks (Acid Software), a racing game from Australia.

TV Sports: Basketball (Cinemaware)
Gem´Z (Kaiko)
Lothar Matthäus Super Soccer (Krisalis)
Manchester United Europe (Krisalis)
World Cup ´90 (Genias)
Projectile (EA)
Dynamite Warrior (Aminet)
Tie Break (Stargate)
Super Tennis Champs (Audiogenic)
Tank Attack
Gravity Power
