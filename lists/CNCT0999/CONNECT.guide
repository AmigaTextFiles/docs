                          @{b}@{u}I N T R O D U C T I O N@{ub}@{uu}

Welcome to the Seventh Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is a Monthly UK
BBS Scene Magazine containing a comprehensive UK BBS Directory.

Many SysOps have tried their hands at generating up-to-date BBS Lists, but
most have found them too difficult to maintain and have abandoned updating
them, with the exception of the odd few, like Turbo D at @{BG fill}@{"Alpha Zone BBS" Link AlphaZoneBBS}@{BG background}
who has for the last 10 months supplied a list of BBS Numbers to the AMINET.

However, most BBS Lists contain BBS Numbers of BBSes that have long since
left the scene, and of all the Lists we have encountered, there hasn't been
one that has been accurately up-to-date.

At the time of going to press, ALL the BBSes listed in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} have
been 100% verified as being online.  We have spent the last 8 months
ringing BBS Numbers to find out which BBSes are still online, and to find
out those that have left the scene.  We have still a lot of work to do, but
I'm sure you can appreciate the cost of dialling every BBS Number we have
found in the afore mentioned BBS Lists, and that is why we need YOUR help
in providing us with information of any BBSes you know that are still
online, that are not listed in this Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.

Furthermore, we need YOUR help in keeping @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} up-to-date with BBS
Closures, New Numbers, Relaunches, Renames etc.  For more details on how to
contact us, access @{BG fill}@{"Submissions" Link Submissions}@{BG background}.

The BBS Scene is in bad need of positive publicity...and we at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
strongly believe that BBS Advertising is a damn good start.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
aims to provide the AMIGA Community with a central resource of information
regarding the current status of the UK BBS Scene, with the added bonus of a
comprehensive UK BBS Directory every month.

When we first researched for @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to find out just how many BBSes
were still up and running, we were pleasantly suprised by the number we
found were still online, and those 124 BBSes we found, were entered into
the First Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  That 124 BBSes has now grown to 191 BBSes
for the Seventh Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, just proving that the UK BBS Scene is
far from dead, as was first thought. 

From our point of view, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has really made a difference to the
number of Calls and New Users at our respective BBSes, and many of our New
Users had never been on a BBS before in their lives, the Internet, yes, but
never a BBS, as they thought that BBSes were extinct.  Feedback from other
SysOps who advertised in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} suggests that they have experienced the
same result, which proves a point, that SysOps should not just sit back and
accept the number of Users in their User-Base, but should advertise their
BBSes as much as possible, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} giving them that very chance.

AMIGA FORMAT Magazine recently started a column for BBS Numbers in their
Readers Adverts section, and those that have advertised, including
ourselves, have found that advertising DOES work, and that there ARE
members of the AMIGA Community who want to call BBSes, but never knew
where to get in contact with them!  Therefore in respect of all you SysOps
that think that advertising is a waste of time...we rest our case!!!

The Internet has done much damage to the UK BBS Scene, especially when Free
ISPs were launched, but that damage is not irrepairable, as we have proven,
and ironically @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has used the Internet to get to it's prospective
audience, to get Internet Users back to the UK BBS Scene, and it appears to
have worked, and worked well.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been well received from SysOps and BBS Users alike, and the
Correspondence we have received from Readers has been tremendous.  We
honestly didn't believe that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would be so popular, and its
thanks to your input and feedback that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has established itself
as the leading UK BBS Scene Magazine after only it's Sixth Issue!!!

Plans to take @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}' coverage beyond the United Kingdom are already
under consideration.  Work on @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has already started, but
we foresee a problem that really needs to be addressed before we continue
any further with the project.  Basically, does the UK BBS Scene really want
an International BBS Directory?  If the answer to this questions is "Yes",
then how do we market it?  Do we release it seperately, to give YOU the
choice whether you want to Download it or not, or do we include it within
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, bearing in mind the Archive Size will probably double?

Please help us to make this decision, get in touch with us at @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text},
and let us know what YOU want.  If we get no response from YOU, as Readers
of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then the @{FG highlight}GLOBAL CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} project will be scrapped!!!

Please keep the Correspondence coming, we would especially like to hear from
SysOps who have advertised their BBSes in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, and have benefitted
as a result.  Also, if any of you have any ideas on how we can improve the
content of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, or if you have anything at all to contribute to
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, then please get in touch, even if you only have a sentence or
two to say, ALL Correspondence will be read and replied to, and may even
get included in the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!

See you Next Issue...

                             @{u}A Word From Dunkie@{uu}

Welcome to Issue Seven of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  Following on from last month's 9 BBS
Closures, it is with much regret that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has to announce another 6
BBS Closures this month.  However, all is not doom and gloom, as @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
welcomes 3 *NEW* BBSes to the UK BBS Scene this month (Comfortably Numb BBS,
@{BG fill}@{"Erotic Studios BBS" Link EroticStudiosBBS}@{BG background}, Innocent BBS) and 1 BBS Relaunch (@{BG fill}@{"Total Oblivion BBS" Link TotalOblivionBBS}@{BG background}).
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has also been reliably informed that 2 of the 6 BBS Closures
this month, are only temporary, until new Phone-Lines are established.

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} popularity appears to be on the increase, with many @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
Readers calling @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background} this month, to ask when the Next Issue was going
to be released, some of them wanting the Next Issue only a week after the
Last Issue was released!!!  But, this good news is overshadowed by the fact
that hardly anyone has bothered to submit any Articles or any Correspondence
to @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} this month.  You would have thought that with @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}
being so popular as it is at the moment, that there would be Articles and
Correspondence from @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Readers coming out of my ears.  Sadly, this
is not the case, and I've seriously considered closing @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} down this
month as a result of this!!!  I mean how can you have a Magazine without any
Content?  How can I know as Editor of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} just what @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is
doing for you, SysOps and Readers, unless you tell me?

The frustrating thing for me this month, has been that @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} has been
discussed and reviewed by SysOps and Readers quite widely on the major Mail
Networks, they being FluffyNet and PowerNet, yet none of these SysOps and
Readers have bothered to tell @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} what they think of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!
It would be nice if SysOps and Readers could let @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} know of any
views they might have, as all Feedback is welcomed, and usually ends up in
the Next Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  Therefore the more the Feedback...the more
the Magazine content, which in turn gives YOU the SysOps and Readers more
to read every month!!!

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would like to specially thank Pipa (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Dark Domain BBS" Link DarkDomainBBS}@{BG background})
and S.N.S (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Skull Monkey BBS" Link SkullMonkeyBBS}@{BG background}) for their continuing support on the
PowerNet Mail Network, and for distributing @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} over the Internet
IRC Channels.  Not only that, Pipa (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Dark Domain BBS" Link DarkDomainBBS}@{BG background}) helped avert
the closure of @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background} this month, after persons unknown attempted to
sabotage @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}.  @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} asked Pipa (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Dark Domain BBS" Link DarkDomainBBS}@{BG background})
for her help with the matter, in trying to undo the damage inflicted to
@{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}, and she really did help out with flying colours...thankyou!!!

On the other hand, @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} would like to apologise to Dave Clarke and
Paul Green, for failing to include their @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site Addresses in
the Last Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  Sorry guys...it totally slipped my mind,
but I can assure you your @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site Addresses are now located
in this Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} and will be in future Issues too!!!

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is always looking for ways in which to improve the content of
the Magazine, and this Issue sees the start of a Readers Adverts Column!!!
If you wish to advertise, either For Sale Items, Wanted Items, Contacts, 
Services etc, then just send your Adverts to the usual @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} E-Mail
Address.  If you don't have E-Mail access, then you can send your Adverts
directly to @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background} or @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}.  When submitting your Advert, which
incidentally will appear for 3 Issues, why not let @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} know at the
same time what you think of the Magazine, or what you'd like to see in
future Issues of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  

@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is only as good as the Readership it gets, and for those that
read @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} and enjoy it, I'd like to say a big thankyou for making
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} the Number One UK BBS Scene Magazine every month.  Even Chris
Seward (Editor Of Amiga Information Online) reads @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} and has made
the offer of hosting a @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Web-Site alongside his own publication's
Web-Site!!!  Other exciting developments are being discussed with various
parties concerning @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, so as long as you SysOps and Readers are
reading @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} and enjoying the Magazine, the better @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is
going to become!!!

See you Next Issue...

                              @{u}A Word From Pete@{uu}

Well here am I, the Co-Editor of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, doing the most unforgivable
sin of nearly closing down @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background} at the end of August, all due to a
bit of skull-duggery by persons unknown against @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}.  But, thanks
to Dunkie (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}) and Pipa (SysOp Of @{BG fill}@{"Dark Domain BBS" Link DarkDomainBBS}@{BG background}), the
situation was resolved and they stopped me from making the big mistake of
closing @{BG fill}@{"Bedlam BBS" Link BedlamBBS}@{BG background}, in a month that has seen another 6 BBSes close down,
for one reason or another, which is another sad blow for the UK BBS Scene.

And now back to our monthly gripe regarding Articles, Feedback, BBS Adverts
etc!!!  Not again I hear you say, but if @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is going to continue in
it's present format, then we do need Feedback from SysOps, to let us know if
the Magazine is helping their BBSes.  We WANT to know, we NEED to know!!!
We also want Articles from SysOps giving their views on the UK BBS Scene, it
doesn't take ages to type out a few paragraphs, so come on guys we don't
want @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} to become just another BBS Listing, we want something that 
makes interesting reading.  The Magazine's future depends on YOU!!!

And for those SysOps who have not yet sent in an Advert for their BBSes,
then please send one into @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, it could make all the difference to
your BBS and to the UK BBS Scene!!!

See you Next Issue...

       @{u}UK Call Charges - By Steve Clack (SysOp Of Total Eclipse BBS)@{uu}

I've been hunting round the Internet for various Call Charges for a program
I created to calculate the cost of the Call to Users of @{BG fill}@{"Total Eclipse BBS" Link TotalEclipseBBS}@{BG background}.
I thought it would be a good idea to put this list in @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} too!

Basically, this is a list of Call Charges for various Telecommunication
Companies, prices are quoted in pence/min and inclusive of VAT but exclusive
of Special Offers (e.g. Friends & Family).  Plus they are the prices for
Residential use, rather than a Business Line.  Note how expensive BT is ;)

   @{u}CoNnEcTiOnS' Helping Hand - By Ronnie Murphy (SysOp Of Kerry-Oot BBS)@{uu}

            IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT PEOPLE DO SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!
     IT'S NOT OFTEN PEOPLE GIVE UP THEIR FREE TIME TO HELP OUT OTHERS!
               AND...IT'S NOT OFTEN I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING!!!

Yes, the @{BG fill}@{"Kerry-Oot BBS" Link KerryOotBBS}@{BG background} is now online and it's all thanks to @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.
No-one takes on the role of SysOp without having first had part of his
brain removed - the part that deals with all rational thought, then having
his Computer ripped from his grasp by the many Callers who ring night and
day - sometimes at an unearthly hour!!!  Yet I decided I wanted to be a
SysOp, simply because I wanted to give something back to the UK BBS Scene -
the UK BBS Scene which has kept the AMIGA alive!!!

I sometimes work Night-Shift, and when I come home, I head straight for bed.
This is not the case with Dunkie, Creator of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Magazine and SysOp
of @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}.  To cut a long story short, Dunkie created the @{BG fill}@{"Kerry-Oot BBS" Link KerryOotBBS}@{BG background}
for me.  He even had many people test it.  I know that Dunkie fitted all
this in with Night-Shift at work, his family and @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} Magazine...not
to mention @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background}!!!  Why?

To be very honest, I have very little knowledge of Computers especially the,
technical side, but Dunkie helped sail me through all this even though he
received nothing in return - except my grateful thanks of course!!!

So I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Dunkie for all that he's done
- and still is doing for the UK BBS Scene.  Gone are the days when SysOps
refuse to help anyone wanting to start a BBS.  First hand I have found that
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} not only lists BBSes...IT MAKES THEM TOO!!!

     @{u}Make More Use Of CoNnEcTiOnS - By Scatman (SysOp Of The Forum BBS)@{uu}

I'd like to say again, to all you SysOps out there, that you really should
make more use of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}.  Never before have we had the opportunity like
this, where 2 guys are willing to put in a little effort to let us advertise
our BBSes.  I now have 90 Users, and just had my 1000th Caller, and I must
say that this is all due to @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} and AMIGA FORMAT.

I recently got a BBS Number (Purple Motion BBS in Edinburgh) from the last
Issue of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, this guy didn't even know about any other BBSes in
Scotland...so I sent him on his way to Dunkie at @{BG fill}@{"Quest BBS" Link QuestBBS}@{BG background} to pick up the
PC Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}!!!  Anyway this still goes to show that it is up
to US, the SysOps, to get our arses into gear and make FULL use of this
great service that we now have.

Thankyou Dunkie & Pete, as without @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} and your efforts, the UK BBS
Scene as we know it would probably just have stayed as stagnent as ever :(

Here's to the future!!!

I would like to welcome you to the new AMIGA Support Association.  The
Association offers help and advice or just a friendly chat.  The main people
that will be organising the Association to start with are:-

Phil Stephens - Founder & Organiser (snood@ukonline.co.uk)
  Mike O'Hara - Mailing List & IRC Moderator
    Mike Legg - General Support

I hope more people will participate and help out as things progress as I
will hopefully be expanding on this idea as things move on.

                                @{u}Mailing List@{uu}

The most favourite place for people to chat would be our Mailing List which
has been set up for you, all you need to do is send an E-Mail to:-

amiga_sa-subscribe@egroups.com

This will allow you to post and read messages to other Classic AMIGA owners
from all over the world.  If there's something you want to know about, just
ask and I'm sure someone will be able to help.  The Mailing List has already
got off to a great start, with new members joining each day.  The Mailing
List is free and so is the advice given.  We are always here to help and
chat.

                         @{u}Internet Relay Chat (IRC)@{uu}

If you are one of those people that would like to meet online to chat with
other Classic AMIGA owners, we have made available an IRC channel on Arcnet
called #ASA.  Please feel free to drop in for a chat.  There is usually
someone attending most weekends and we hope that people will meet up and
have an enjoyable chat.

     Arcnet - Port 6667
IRC Channel - #ASA

                             @{u}Meetings & Events@{uu}

A venue for regular meetings will hopefully be setup shortly and will be in
the Southampton area.  So if you're local, please pledge your support as this
will only go ahead if we have enough people to warrant it.  We will only be
looking to cover our costs for this and you will only be charged a minimal
amount for an entrance fee.  Hopefully this will encourage more people to
join, and create a larger User-Base which will benefit everyone.

For further information, contact Phil Stephens on (023)-8048-9701 or E-Mail

"Why are you suprised, with the accessibility of greater things at people's
fingertips, that the UK BBS Scene is being so badly supported?  Flogging a
dead Horse you may be, but what can we do, as SysOps, to make the Horse
worth flogging?"

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

My surprise don't rest with the people who call BBSes, it's the SysOps who
I'm surprised at, for not supporting the UK BBS Scene that they have thrived
on for years!  The Internet has and still is damaging the UK BBS Scene, and
basically there's nothing we SysOps can do to stop this!  But, however, we
can ease the blow by making an effort to support the existing UK BBS Scene,
and attempt to draw new people into OUR CyberSpace by advertising our BBSes
where ever possible.  A few months ago, I negotiated with AMIGA FORMAT for a
BBS Adverts section in their Magazine, and those SysOps that have advertised
in their pages have ALL seen an upward surge in their UserBase and Callers.
Yet, only a handful of SysOps have bothered to take up this free opportunity
that has been provided for them, and unfortunately it's the same story with
@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} :(  ALL SysOps should be taking advantage of these opportunities
and using them to maintain the integrity of not only their own BBSes, but
also the integrity of the UK BBS Scene.  At the end of the day, the fate of
the UK BBS Scene rests in the hands of the SysOps...NOT the Internet!!!

"@{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is a breath of fresh air for the UK BBS Scene.  It has a good
quantity of content, and the content is interesting and of high quality.
The only problem I have with @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} is that the HTML Version is almost
identical to the AmigaGuide Version.  There's no Pictures, apart from a few
Movement Control Arrows on each page!!!  I don't mean to moan, its great,
but I think HTML could have been utilised a little more i.e. when a BBS
Launches/Relaunches, add a Screen-Grab of the Log-In Screen, just to show
what it looks like.  Other than that, I don't see much that can be improved
with @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}...so keep up the good work!!!  I'm sure @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} owns a
high responsibility for keeping the UK BBS Scene together, as much as it has
done already :)"

@{u}Editors Comment:-@{uu}

The HTML Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} was basically created for PC Users, so they
could read @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} as it was intended to be read, hence the reason why
the HTML Version is almost identical to the AmigaGuide Version.  As for the
HTML Version of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} not having any Pictures etc, that unfortunately
boils down to the following reasons:-

[1] I'm not versed with the HTML Language, so I'm basically just converting
    the AmigaGuide to HTML, which enables @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} not only to be read on
    every Computer Platform, but also enables the Magazine to be ported to
    a Web-Site.

[2] If I were to add Pictures, the Archive size would increase dramatically,
    and already I've had complaints about the JPEG included in the early
    @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text} archives, so much so, that I no longer distribute it.

So at this moment in time, the HTML Version can't be utilised in the way
that you propose.  Ideally I'd love to produce a real glossy HTML Version
of @{FG highlight}CoNnEcTiOnS@{FG text}, one that in time could replace the AmigaGuide Version
entirely.  But until I get to grips with the HTML Language, I'm afraid this
idea may be a long way off.  Maybe you can point me in the right direction?
