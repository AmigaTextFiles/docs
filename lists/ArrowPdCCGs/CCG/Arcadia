army grows stronger and his city grows larger. Do you have the might to
face the Mad King in the very heart of his city?
      Arcadia: King Ironheart's Madness can be played as a standalone game
or as a continuation of The Wyld Hunt. It will contain new Leagues, Waylays,
Quests, Races, Merits and Flaws. It will also require two dice to play.


      All that is needed to start playing Arcadia is one Story pack and one
Character pack per person. Every Story pack contains a different quest. You
can add as many Story and Character packs to your deck as you like.
