The X-Files Interactive Card Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully have never played games.

Until now.

     Now you can capture the same suspense and intrigue of The X-Files
as you construct unique conspiracies surrounding Agents, Sites, Events,
Witnesses and many other categories in an attempt to solve your opponents
conspiracy. The mysteries lay beneath every corner and behind every
card. The closer you come to the truth, the more powerful the conspiracy
becomes. Only two rules apply......Deny Everything.....Trust No One.


     These starter and booster packs cover the first two seasons of
The X-Files television series. All cards feature high resolution
photographic images lifted directly from the appropriate episode of 
The X-Files.
      Future expansion sets will each focus on the third and following
seasons as well as the X-Files feature film.
