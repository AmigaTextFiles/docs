What are Customisable Card Games?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      If you have not heard of Customisable Card Games, or CCG's for
short, then read on! CCG's open up a new world where you can be what you
want to be or who you want to be!

      Imagine a world where you can be an agent in the X-Files, or maybe be
in charge of the Enterprise, or perhaps you want to be fighting alongside
Luke Skywalker or even Darth Vader!

      Imagine a world where the far distant lands of 'Arcadia' or perhaps
'Dominaria' is your homeland. Lands that have their own races, Rulers and
quests! You could be a powerful Wizard who fights for good or evil, against
or with, all manner of creatures and spells, or you could be an ordinary
person who finds themselves caught up in events that unravel themselves
before your eyes. Can you save your world?

      All these choices and more, are entirely yours. So whatever, or
whoever, you want to be..........enter the world of CCG's.


What do I need to play?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      It is so easy. All you need is a friend and a pack of cards for
each player and you will be playing in a matter of minutes. If you are new,
it is recommended that you start with a 'Starter' pack. This will ensure
that you have all the necessary cards and instructions needed to start.
You can then build and expand your decks with 'Booster' packs.
      
      Starter packs contain 60 cards randomly drawn from all the cards
printed, so you get a mixture of both common cards and rare cards. It also
ensures that no two starter decks are the same. Booster packs also contain
this mixture of random rare/common cards.

      The joy of CCG's is that EVERY game you play will be different.


      So journey on, prepare to enter a different world.......one where
you are only tethered by your imagination.
