Bison           A replacement for unix "yacc" command.  This is from
                the GNU (GNU is Not Unix) effort, and was obtained
                from the Free Software Foundation.  This is a working

Compress        This is an update to the compress version released
                on disk number 6.  It is tested and seems to work
                well except for a couple glitches noticed at the
                last minute (see the README file). Compress reduces the
                size of the named files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding.
                The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of
                the input, the number of bits per code, and the distribution
                of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code
                or English is reduced by 50-60%.  Compression is generally
                much better then that achieved by Huffman coding
                (as used in "pack") or adaptive Huffman coding
                (as used in "compact"), and takes less time to compute.

Compiler        An optimizing C compiler for the 68000.  Has successfully
                compiled itself on a 68000 based Unix system V machine,
                but has yet to be fully ported to the Amiga.  It will
                currently produce assembly output for simple C routines
                on the Amiga, but needs lots of work to be really useful
                as anything other than a learning tool for budding compiler

                "box", and "text") and a small set of editing functions
                (like "move", "size", and "rotate").  While drawing and
                editing, the user can call on other functions to
                modify the display; to zoom in, slide around, superimpose
                a grid, etc.  This shareware program was submitted by
                the author.  Many improvements over the version 
                released on disk number 56.  Binary only.

Blitz           Blitz is a small program that is designed to be loaded
                into memory and that sits in the background until activated
                by its hotkey.  It allows you to view a text file, much
                like a TYPE command, only that it lets you move forwards
                and backwards through the file.  Its screen updates are
                blitz'n.  Binary only.

This is disk 62 of the freely distributable AMIGA software library.

This disk contains a port of the popular UNIX game "Hack", done by
John Toebes and the crew at the Software Distillery.  This is version
1.0.3D.  The disk is unchanged except for the following:

        (1)        I have added this file, README.list62.

        (2)        I have added the standard distribution info file,
                README.dist.

        (3)        I have copied all the files to a freshly formatted
                disk, to create the master distribution disk, using
                a command of the form "copy df0: to df1: all".  This
                insures that disk fragmentation is kept to a minimum,
                but also has the unfortunate side-effect that all
                the file dates are changed.

Note that this disk must be named "Hack_Game".  I have elected to keep
that name, rather than using the usual "AmigaLibDiskXX" convention for
disks in my library, to avoid requiring users to rename the disk before
using it.

Bawk            Text processor inspired by the Unix awk utility.  Bawk
                searches files for specific patterns and performs
                actions for every occurance of these patterns.  The
                patterns can be regular expressions.  The actions are
                expressed using a subset of the C language.  Unfortunately
                this version always gets a stack overflow no matter what
                the stack is set to, I haven't had a chance to find the
                bug.  Includes source, so you can hunt for it.  Looks

                fare too well on even a simple little Pascal fragment from
                Software Tools in Pascal.  I don't know if the problem is
                machine dependencies in the code or bugs.  Looks like it

        GNU Emacs, so certain features you may have seen in other
        versions of MicroEmacs may work differently here, or not exist.
        Hopefully, you'll find the added features MG provides to be
        worth the trouble it takes to make the switch. 

        As well as the commands available on *all* systems MG supports,
        Amiga MG has many Amiga-specific features: the Amiga mouse (with
        24 different functions!), Intuition pull-down menus, the Browser
        (a very nice way to select files), Amiga function keys, a
        full-screen editing window, and support for using a different
        text font in the editing window. 


MicroGNUEmacs is based on the original work of Dave Conroy, author of the
public domain v30 version.  It has been greatly enhanced through the
efforts of the following people:

        mwm@ucbopal.berkeley.edu        Mike Meyer
        mic@ngp.utexas.edu                Mic Kaczmarczik
        blarson@usc-eclb.arpa                Bob Larson
        rtech!daveb@sun.com                Dave Brower        (previous version)

============================ README.list83 ==============================
This is disk 83 of the freely distributable AMIGA software library.

This disk contains a demo version of TeX, ported to the Amiga by
Tomas Rokicki.  The disk is unchanged except for the following:

        (1)        I have added this file, README.list83, the standard
                distribution info file, README.dist, and associated
                icon files, plus "less" to read the text files.

        (2)        I have copied all the files to a freshly formatted
                disk, to create the master distribution disk, using
                xcopy, which preserves the file dates.  This insures
                that disk fragmentation is kept to a minimum.

        (3)        In order to make room for the files I have added, I
                have compressed the file TeX/inputs/amigatex.tex using
                a version of compress (compress.b13) that should run on
                any standard 512K amiga.  This version of compress is
                found in c/compress.b13.  To recover the original file,
                execute the commands:

                cd AmigaLibDisk83:TeX/inputs
                :c/compress.b13 <amigatex.tex.Z >ram:amigatex.tex -d


Since this is a demo version of Tom's commercial product, it has several
limitations that let you get the flavor of the real thing but encourage
you to buy the commercial version.  These limitations include TeX being
limited to processing only small files, the previewer being limited
to displaying ten pages or less, and only a small number of fonts being
provided.  The full version of AmigaTeX comes on eight floppies and will
handle larger documents than most mainframe versions of TeX.  See the
tex/README file for further info.

This disk contains a distribution of ADL (Adventure Definition Language).
ADL is a superset of an older language named DDL, by Michael Urban,

enhancements were made by Ross Cunniff, who submitted this material
for inclusion in the library.  The disk is essentially unchanged except
that:

                users get at least some information about this disk
                and about ADL (which is only usable from the CLI 
                environment).

        (2)        The disk name has been changed to AmigaLibDisk91.

        (3)        The standard library files "GeneralInfo", "Contents",
                and "Distribution", along with their associated icons,
                have been added to the disk.

        (4)        The directory 'c' has been added, along with a very
                nice text reader program called "less", which is the
                default tool for reading all the text files for which
                there are icons.

Included here are the sources to the ADL compiler, interpreter, and
debugger.  The binaries were compiled by Ross with the Lattice 3.03
compiler.  Ross noted in his letter that currently ADL is a
CLI environment program only, but that he hopes to offer a more
Amiga'ized version in the future.  Also, the stack size should be
set to at least 10000 before attempting to run ADL.
