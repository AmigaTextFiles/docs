@{U}HISTORY VersCheck@{UU}

@{B}V 1.14 / 10.06.1999@{UB} - Bugfix (HTML side creation for the
                      MUI and Handler guide was a bug!)
                      MUIClassesGuide updated.

@{B}V 1.13 / 09.06.1999@{UB} - WarpOS and PowerUP now supported.
                      Both versions without requester because
                      startup of the requesters crashes.
                    - Installer for new versions.
                    - Small internal changes.

@{B}V 1.12 / 06.06.1999@{UB} - Every list has now a file for the author.
                      It has the same position as the list file and ends
                      with Mail.
                    - The author from the mail file filled in the new
                      variable $email.
                    - language files with $email changed (V1.4)

@{B}V 1.11 / 17.05.1999@{UB} - Bugfix: internal string to small.
                    - Versioncheck now without errormessage from
                      c:version (with special thanks to Gerald
                      Schnabel <Gerald@Schnabel-online.de>).
                    - After a complete recompiling the CPU
                      are now displayed correct.
                    - If no FPU the FPU are displayed with a
                      adress. Var now corrected initialised and
                      problem corrected.

@{B}V 1.10 / 14.05.1999@{UB} - Internal Versionstring not found
                      by c:version. Problem corrected.
                    - The CPU/FPU are not correct displayed. It
                      isn't a bug in VersCheck. The bug come from
                      compiling the source, but I don't found the
                      reason to send a bugreport to Volker or
                      do any thing that fix the problem. Only thing
                      I can do is searching.

@{B}V 1.9  / 30.04.1999@{UB} - norsk-catalog included
                    - Option -4 and -5 added for MUI and
                      for handler. Internal update of the
                      name compare to handle * and ?
                    - $VER has skipped chars over 127. Now
                      accept 32-127 and greater 159.
                     
@{B}V 1.8  / 15.04.1999@{UB} - The new functions for 1.7
                      full testet and little "clean" changes
                      in the new functions for Class-Guide.
                    - The WB-Interface (disabled in 1.7)
                      is now completed and useable.
                    - This changes forces updates for the
                      archive-files, the installerscript
                      and scriptsdir.
                    - Small bugfix: Last text from locale-
                      file wasn't read-> eng. buttons in
                      german version.

@{B}V 1.7  / 14.04.1999@{UB} - version for the ClassGuide.
                      *** Only for internal use ***

@{B}V 1.6  / 12.04.1999@{UB} - accept the scriptdir and / or
                      localefiles now also in 'PROGDIR:'
                      Many more filetypes are known in the
                      filecheck. The headerinfo's are taken
                      from Gateway-5. 
                    - The long missed getargs-function now
                      included.
                      The fullpath option (-f) show now the
                      absolute path, not only a part from
                      startposition.
                    - Bugfix: Logic for create HTML-sites
                      corrected (before: YES=don't create,
                      NO=create)

@{B}V 1.5  / 06.04.1999@{UB} - merge mode (-m) changed.
                      No automatic header if -1, -2 or -3
                      and -m set. Only the option -s can
                      now activate the header in this mode.
                      So the header is not longer a lot
                      of time written to the same file.
                    - new option -f (fullpath) added.
                    - Bug in installer script fixed. The
                      directory script copied every time
                      cause the YES/NO-quest not works.
                    - printout from -v(erbose) formatted.
                    - lot's of little changes.

@{B}V 1.4  / 03.04.1999@{UB} - new filetypes added.
                    - New option -n (no requesters) to disable
                      the requests.
                    - New option -m (merge) to merge the neu
                      output to existing data.
                      This is for the CheckGuides only.
                    - Installer script in german and english
                      for easy installation added.

@{B}V 1.3  / 01.04.1999@{UB} - Better splitting versionstring.
                      Spaces in objectnames are now accepted.
                    - Check for single files added.
                      If a directory given, the dir is checked,
                      if a filename given, the version is printed.
                      Using -1/-2/-3 with a single file compares
                      the file with the checkguides. In this case
                      all outputfiles are written. Only the HTML-
                      update-side is not created.
                    - The readme files are replaced by AmigaGuides.
                    - Versiontest for locale files added.

@{B}V 1.2  / 27.03.1999@{UB} - Requester added
                      Display info's about the check in reqtools-
                      requester, if reqtools.library is available.
                      If not the info's are only printed into cli.
                    - HTML form (update form) added.
                    - Select -x add now .elf, .wos and .ppc to the
                      comparelist. Reason:
                      In past, only one or two libraries named
                      xxxxxx.elf exists. But now, e.g. Andreas
                      Kleinert creates new datatypes, named
                      akXXXX.datatype, akXXXX.elf, akXXXX.wos
                      Other authors go the same way. VersCheck can
                      now handle this.

@{B}V 1.1  / 13.03.1999@{UB} - The headerinformation now also printed into
                      the outputfiles.

                    - Bugfix: languagetext not ever closed.
                    - Function -1, -2 and -3 can now be start without
                      dir. If so, the default will be used. The defaults
                      are:
                      -1 = Libs: / -2 = Devs: / -3 = Sys:Classes/Datatypes

@{U}@{B}Supported CPU's@{UU}@{UB}

Because I use vbcc as compiler it is possible to create versions for all CPU-types they are available on the Amiga. And this is now done.

All versions for mc68000 upto mc68060 should be work without any problems if the right CPU is installed. Because I using only WarpOS on my system the version for PowerUP "VersCheck.elf" is untested!

The WarpOS-version crashed at starting the requesters. I don't have found the reason in the moment but I think the problem is in my REQUEST.lib that is still in progress. So I have the no-request-mode actived in both PPC-versions. The WarpOS-version is a BETA version and there a definitiv bugs in it.

This program use lot of stack. If the stack is to small, a GURU
is the answer (or not, with thank's to MCP).
The stackusage is variable, for big directorytree's more stack
will need as for small trees.
StackSnoop show as highest stack 74966.
A stack greater/equal 100.000 should be enough everywere.

Copy the program in any directory you like.

To use the comparesystem:
Go in the directory that include the dir "scripts" with the
comparelists and start the program or if the scriptdir and the
program are in the same directory, you can start without
change dir.

Use as versionlister/-checker:
You can put the program to any location and start it from
all positions you like.

        If -1 to -3 used with a filename only the given file
        is checked. If a directory given -a is set. In both cases
        also -s (but only, if -m is not set) is set.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        Add a new compare without update of VersCheck can be made by
        using this special options:

-0s   = Versioncompare, free definition. Select the .siffix.
-0l   +       "           "      "     . Select the list in scripts.
-0n   +       "           "      "     . Select the end of name for
        resultlists. (E.g.: -0n CLASS creates Ram:NewCLASS, Ram:AltCLASS)
        -0s, -0l, -0n MUST be used as complete group. There are no
        default's. 
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

-f    = show the full path of every checked file. For long runs without
        human control.

-n    = no requester (disable the request's when finishing a CheckGuide
        compare).

-m    = merge new output to existing output from CheckGuide lists (normal
        the old files will be overwritten).

-p    = Disable executable, scan's for iff pictures.
-P    = Disable executable, scan's for all pictures.

-a    = All subdirectorys included.

-s    = Show system informationen (OS-version/CPU).
        The system info shows installed PPC-CPU's and MMU's, if the
        mmu.library (Thor) and/or the ppc.library (Phase5) are
        installed.

-v    = verbose (shows testoutputs).

-x    = Handle WarpOS-programs and PowerUP-programs like Amiga-programs.
-x1   = Handle only PowerUP-programs like Amiga-programs.
-x2   = Handle only WarpOS-Programs like Amiga-Programs.
-x3   = Same as '-x'.

dir   = Start directory for compare. Subdirectory will scanned only by
        setting -a.

file  = Show version of this single file.


You can give a file or a dir, not both. The Options can be used in
groups or single, like you feal.
-1sav is identical with -1 -s -a -v or -1 -sav and so on.
Only -x is a special thing. Must stand allone or at end. After x are
only the switches 1,2 or 3 allowed.
The free definitiongroup (0) must also select by single usage.

@{U}@{B}Third party products@{UU}@{UB}

VersCheck uses some third party producs:

1.) Command @{I}VERSION@{UI} from AmigaDOS. BE CAREFULLY with the
    "better replacements". They often read only the $VER-
    string, the original read much more.

2.) @{I}ppc.library@{UI} (if exists) to find informations about
    installed PowerPC-CPU(s) and info's about them.
    Original by Phase5.
    (Emulation by Frank Wille *not testet* yet).

3.) @{I}mmu.library@{UI} V0.24+ (is exists) to find informations about
    MMUs.
    Original by Thor, see AmiNet
    PPC-User read 'Known errors', please.

4.) @{I}reqtools.library@{UI} for requesters.
    Copyright by © Nico François and Magnus Holmgren.

If a library not exist, the check will skipped and no info's
printed. If a library can not work (mmu.library) the info's
also skipped.
If there is no version-command it can't be used for
compare/information. This will reduce the change to identify
and/or find versioninformations.
If the reqtools.library not exists all infos only printed in
cli. The request for HTML-update-page is set to YES and the
update-side is generated in every case.

This AmigaGuide is created with Guided by Linus McCabe.

@{U}@{B}Programfunctions and background@{UU}@{UB}

The program searches "$VER:"-string and split them. It also run the
command @{U}version@{UU} and split the output, too.

The program do not sort. It scan's the filesystem and compare
direct all entries (function ExAll() is used!). No sort make it
faster, except systems with many files.

The outputdata is useable for many things. But in first order it
will be used to compare it with the Lib-, DT- and Device-check.

I found the idea behind the checksystms very good and I see the
time and energy for catalog and support this lists.

But there is a problem, with is very komplex and it is very difficult
to correct by cli-scripts, ARexx or other batchbased systems.
Most problem will be found by older libs. Versionnumbers like
"1.-1", wrong or funny strings at the position of the name and
versionnumbers that called x.x, V x.x or Vx.x!

This program "tried" to identify this data and compare the result with the
comparedata. "Tried" while I only can test and check the data with my
system. So the identifying will not be perfect in the first version
but this will be better from version to version.

If the output really shit (sorry), please send me a copy of the files
that produce the wrong output. Please contact me first, if the files
are not freely distribtable. In this case it is better send me a cut
from the file. Otherwise the copy is piratesoft and I don't want become
such software.

@{U}@{B}Future@{UU}@{UB}

Better compare, errorcorrection and new functions. If you wish a special
function for any useage, let it me know.

The program DVC, that do parts of this tests in the past, includes
functions that I never will missing. E.g. testing of files for there
version. A requester ask for install the file. The problem is, DVC is
not longer 100% actual. And I missing functions like installing new
file automaticly (by backup the actual files). I also missing a switch
that skip older files by default. So I will create a copyfunction
like DVC with more and better features.

To identify files only by extensions is also a problem from DVC. A
readme, named xxx.library, will be copied to libs:, not lly usefull.

More datatypes should be identified.

A brainfile for the copyfunction is actual at work.
Antilist's for virus-warnings and other actual things coming soon.

The actual mmu.library will not work on PPC-systems and so on such
systems the MMU can't be displayed.
The author has no information about the mmu-useage on ppc-systems
and Phase-5 don't cooperate. Because the help of Haage & Partner
this problem is only temporary.


@{U}@{B}Problem with other programs@{UU}@{UB}

At my tests the system stops at bigger directory's. Reasons:

1.) Output in a KingCon-CLI-window (CON: and AUX: remapped to KingCon).
    Reason unknown, bit same problem appears by use of vim and other
    programs. A long time this problem don't exist, then it comes up.
    I think it is a problem between KingCon und another unknown software.
    To do: Using verbose-mode (-v) fix the problem (I don't know why).

2.) System full stops at testing mpegavideo.datatype.
    Reason is the command c:version. I don't know why, but the command
    crashes. I'm not shure, but I think it is a hardwareproblem at my
    system.
    To do: The problem will not appear if the directory that will be
            tested is into a ram disk or rad disk.
    After installation of WarpOS and decrunching all files on Sys: the
    check works. I'm not shure why. But I think decrunching the files
    is the right way. WHY ANYBODY CRUNCHING ANYTHING? The prices of
    harddisk are low and crunched files are slow.

@{U}The compare:@{UU}

Any file is identified by the "magic number". The "magic number"
are the first 4 bytes (evetually 8, but I this case 4 are enough)
of a binary file. On this a file can be identified, e.g. an
Amigaprogram, a MS-Dos-Program and so on.! Libraries, devices and
datatypes have all the code for 'executable amigaprogram'. So only
files with this 'magic number' are tested in the moment.
So a textfile, called "Libs:Irgendwas.Library" will not be tested!
The filetypes ELF/EHF (PowerUP/WarpOS) from ppc can only be checked
by using the '-x'-option.

The extensions ".library", ".device" oder ".datatype" will be also
tested. If nessesary this will be expanded. (e.g. MUI 'mcc' and
'mcp'). If the checkguides will test more things I will change this
for them.

For the header the mmu.library and the ppc.library will be used.
If they are not installed, the part will be ignored.

The versioncompare will done numeric, the version is splitt into
th 2 or 3 parts from X.Y(.Z). The numeric values will be corrected.
Versions like 1.-1 gives Version 1, Revision 1.

@{U}@{B}Information about locale for VersCheck:@{UU}@{UB}

The program is not real localised, it has an own way to handle
multilingual outputs.

This program is designed and created for two differnt functions.
First, to compare your versions with the listfiles from LibCheck,
DevCheck and DTypeCheck.
Second, in future, to compare and update program- and systemfiles,
like DVC. But with more functions and a configurable file for
suffixes.

In future the program is available in AmiNet and also included by
the CheckLists. What do, if anyone install this program anywhere
on his amiga and the CheckList include an other version?

To fix this problem, and make it easy to create localised texts
for any language and without any knowhow, I create only asciifiles
with the text's in it. You can edit it with any ascii-edit like Ed,
Edit, CygnusEd, emacs, vi, and so on. But FIRST look on the output
of the program, second edit it. Otherwise it could be, that you
create a very funny output

Line 1 to 3 are comments, please don't change it.
The lines 4 to 42 are the outputstrings for VersCheck. VersCheck
look at first in the actual directory and the startdir of the
program for a file, named VersCheck.<Locale>.

The value for <Locale> is read from ENV:Language, normally set by
your s:startup-sequence at boottime.

If VersCheck not found this file, the program look for
Locale:catalogs/<Locale>/VersCheck.catalog
If you install the program on your system put the correct textfile
to locale. For the use by the CheckLists only, let the files where
they are.

At this time only 3 files available:

VersCheck.deutsch   (Locale:catalogs/deutsch/VersCheck.catalog)
VersCheck.english   (Locale:catalogs/english/VersCheck.catalog)
VersCheck.norsk     (Locale:catalogs/norsk/VersCheck.catalog)

If you translate this in any other language, please send me your
file to include it in the releasepackage.
eMail: AmigaUser@01019freenet.de

Never inserting oder deleting lines from the file. If you do that
you become unreadable or wrong outputs.

The max. lenght per line is 70 characters, more will truncated.

Empty lines are changed to the build-in-text (english).
