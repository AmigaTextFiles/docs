If you want a nice flicker-free high resoloution (640*512 +)
display today on your Amiga, you have two choises; you can either
buy a (very) expensive multisync monitor, or you can buy a cheap
VGA monitor. The problem with the VGA-monitors is that they don't
work with PAL mode. And, unfortunately, this is exactly what most
games require. But a few(?) games work with ModePromotion, so therefore
studio BÄMS now presents the List of Games That You Are Able To ModePromote,
or short:

studio BÄMS can in no way be held responsible
if you buy a  game  because  it is listed in this list
and then doesn't work on your machine.

Use this information at your own risk!!!

This time we bring you "Ladder to success"

Enjoy!

tulkas/studio BÄMS
----
A man was walking along the street when he saw a ladder going up into
the clouds.  As any of us would do, he climbed the ladder.  He reached
a cloud, upon which sat a rather plump and very ugly woman.  "Screw me
or climb the ladder to success" she said.  No contest, thought the man,
so he climbed the ladder to the next cloud.

On this cloud was a slightly thinner lady, who was appreciably easier
on the eye. "Screw me hard or climb the ladder to success" she said.
"Well", thought the man, "might as well carry on."

On the next cloud was an even more shapely woman who, this time, was
quite attractive. "Screw me now or climb the ladder to success" she
exclaimed.  As he turned her down and went on up the ladder, the man
thought to himself that this was getting better the further he went.

On the next cloud was an absolute "drop dead" beauty.  Slim,
attractive, busty, the works. "Have wild gorilla sex with me or climb
the ladder to success," she flirted.

Unable to imagine what could be waiting, and being a gambling man, he
decided to climb again. When he reached the next cloud, there was a 400
pound grotesque man with arm pit hair showing and flies buzzing around
his head.  "Who are you?" the man questioned.

"Hello" grunted the ugly fat man, "my name is Cess!"
