For a complete listing of the programs on these two disks, see the file
called "README".  Because of the nature of Matt's programs and the need
for his support libraries to recreate many of his programs, I opted to
keep these disks pretty much as Matt sent them to me, rather than follow
the usual AmigaLibDisk format of binaries and sources in one directory.
This would have undoubtedly increased this to a three disk set.  Please
note that if you plan on recreating any of these programs, then it is
quite possible that you will need information from both disks.

    These two disks contain binaries and sources to the latest release of
    quite a bunch of my programs.  Many are updates to older versions and
    some are new.  The two major additions that are noteworthy are
    DRES.LIBRARY and BACKUP.






PAGE 126
    Note that to compile various programs you must have a working SUP32.LIB,
    DRES.LIB, and DRES.LIBRARY.  Also a new include subdirectory, local,
    must be installed. Only DRES.LIBRARY is independant while the other two
    (binaries) require Aztec C V3.6 ... you have to recompile for other
    versions of Aztec C.  With a bit of hacking a good programmer would be
    able to set up an enviroment for Lattice C.  Of particular attention to
    somebody trying to do this is the modification of the LIBREF program to
    generate Lattice compatible assembly (in the DRES source section).

    Noted programs which are missing:        DNET, and DTERM are not ready for
    re-release yet.


    CONFIG  V1.00       Used to configure friendly programs like DME for
                        the initial window placement (configures the
                        executable)

    Clock   V1.00       Simple clock, configurable with config.

    DME     V1.31       My programming oriented editor

    DMouse  V1.10       mouse enhancer .. acceleration, blanking, etc...
                        (now handles requesters better w/ auto-activate)

    Backup  V2.01       HD backup/restore (same program just renamed)

    SUPLIB              Support (link time) library required to compile
                        my programs.

    LIBREF              Utility for generating run-time library link library
                        assembly files, lvo.asm, and the run-time library's
                        vector list.  See the DRES source for usage.
                        Currently very Aztec in terms of what it generates.

    DRES    V1          Support (run time) library w/ lots of functions
                        including a generic parser and IPC.

    DASM    V2.11       Small-systems assembler.  Handles 6502 and some of
                        the Motorola single chip microcomputers.  Generates
                        code (not object module oriented).

    FTOHEX              Part of DASM used to convert a DASM executable into
                        an intel-hex formatted ascii file.

    FILES   V1.2        My disk catalog program.  Haven't enhanced it much
                        but did fix some bugs.

    SHELL   V2.10       Added enviroment variable support and some other
                        junk.  Use ConMan if you want command line editing,
                        I do (it should not be a function of the shell and
                        it isn't in mine).

    FINDIT  V1.00       Search for a filename (wildcard)

    LIBS    V1.00       list libraries/devices in ram or attempt to remove
                        libraries.

    SCAT    V1.00       Utility to 'cat' binaries without blowing up the
                        display
PAGE 127
    ADDCR   V1.00       Utility to add CR's before LF's in files

    REMCR   V1.00       Utility to remove CR's in files

    CMP     V1.00       Utility to compare two files

Sozobon-C       Atari ST version of what appears to be a full K&R freeware
                C-compiler, assembler and linker.  The compiler main pass
                and the assembler were compiled and tested on an Amiga A2000
                with only minimal changes, and they appear to work (to the
                extent that they believe they are running on an Atari-ST),
                so an Amiga port should be relatively easy.

MFix            A small program to insert in the startup-sequence of the
                commercial program, Marauder II, from Discovery Software,
                International.  Whenever the copy process is started, the
                rainbow screen is covered by a bare screen until the copy
                is finished.  The author claims a 25% decrease in copy time
                is achieved.

                Author:  Gotz Muller

Spiff           Make controlled approximations between two files.  Similar 
                to "diff" but more versatile.  Allows for the handling of 
                numerals as string literals or numeric values with
                adjustable tolerances.  Provides for embedded commands,
                scriptfiles, and many other command-line parameters.
                Potentially very useful, but needs some Amiga-specific work.

AnalytiCalc     Version 23-2A
        This disk contains version V23-2A of Glenn Everhart's large and powerful
        spreadsheet program called AnalytiCalc, submitted to me directly by
        Glenn for inclusion in the library as an update to the version released
        on disk 144. AnalytiCalc is presented in entirely ZOOed form because it
        could not otherwise fit on a single disk. Because the auxiliary
        utilities were presented on disk 144, they are not repeated here.
        The ZOO utility is used due to the lack of controversy over the
        format. The public domain BOOZ program is provided to extract the
        contents of the ZOO archives provided.
        With this release, AnalytiCalc has become "Freeware" rather than
        "Shareware".  Thus the only restrictions on AnalytiCalc code are
        that derivative programs remain freely distributable.

HyperNet        A small hypertext shell program for Amiga, presented
        with sources and brief documents. It was also submitted by Glenn
        Everhart, the author.  HyperNet allows a "master" AmigaDos
        process to control a series of connected
        processes, where the connections are randomly ordered directed
        graphs. Permissible "child" processes available at any stage are
        governed by the links of the graph. The implementation is mainly
        instructive, but can be used for tutorials or demonstrations and
        illustrates the simplicity of hypertext concepts on a multi-tasking
        system.

ASpice          A version of the SPICE 2G.6 circuit analysis program
                which has been modified to run in the Amiga environment.
                The program arrays are adjusted to require one forth the
                memory of the DEC VAX version.  Although this does not
                usually put much of a constraint on circuit analysis,
                some users who are used to the full mainframe environment
                may have to be more aware of the memory demands of their
                analysis.  Requires a minimum  of 1.5 MB memory.  This
                version neither supports nor requires the 68020 processor
                or 68881 coprocessor.  Binary only.

This is a copy of the official November 1988 Commodore IFF disk, sent
to me directly by Commodore for inclusion in the library.  The only
changes I made were:    

        (1)        Placed all the files in the "documents" directory
                into a zoo file "documents.zoo" to free up enough
                space to add my normal distribution files and icons.
                Some of the files on the disk were already in zoo 
                format anyway, so this seems like a minor alteration.

        (2)        Changed the file "AboutThisRelease" to reflect the
                zoo'ing of the documents.

        (3)        Rearranged the icons to make room for my additional
                icons.
