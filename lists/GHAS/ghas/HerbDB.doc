Short:  Maintenance Update: database of nearly 1000 herbs
Uploader: drstrange@jps.net

Type:  docs/lists

    Maintenance Update:  Some more herbs added, other entries cleaned
up, a few more botanical names for older entries found.
    NEW:  Inclusion of the Herbex.rexx script by Chris Dawson; it
converts the database into a form more usable by some PC database
programs (apparently the ascii version I've included isn't entirely
compatible with some programs).


    Welcome to the Great Herbal And Substance Database (GHAS)!  This is a database containing information
on the reputed properties of herbs, vitamins, amino acids, and other supplements.  A database of nearly
1000 entries, including what bodily systems they affect, some descriptions, any toxic effects, and all you
need to decide what to do at the local healthfood stores.

           Why this Database?
    Well, just take a look at any given herbal supplement at the healthfood store; the label doesn't tell
anything about what it's supposed to be good for, and yet you know there's all sorts of things these herbs
are supposed to be good for.  The reason for the blank label is that, here in the USA, the FDA won't
permit any descriptive labeling until it's gone through about 20 years of testing, several testing fees,
and been finally marketed a decade after it's too late for anything to matter (and then priced beyond
anyone wanting to buy it) - read as, the AMA and FDA have a thing going together, but that's a different
story.  Your only option then is to buy one of those inch-thick books by all those helpful doctors that
tell you which herb does what, but only after you've paid a good chunk of money for them (after which, you
can then no longer afford to buy the herb that you wanted to find out about!).
  Enter this database and the concept of freedom of information.  From several sources (including health
store mailings, ingredient labels, and an actual book on herbs or two) I have gleaned information on the
uses of 692 herbs, vitamins, amino acids, minerals, and other substances and put it inot the very useful
and extremely universal database format.  Now if you want to know what an herb does, or what's best for a
given ailment, all you have to do is a qquick database search (I'll assume you own a computer or you
wouldn't have downloaded this, or I think they give database programs away in cereal boxes).
    Considering the exploding popularity of supplements and alternative medicine, I think this should
prove to be an extremely useful database.

                Formats
    This archive contains the database in two formats.  The first is for the Amiga, in the native format
for the Twist2 database program.  The other is in ascii text, with each field enclosed in quotes and comma
deliminated.  The first record (line 1) contains the titles of each of the fields in the order that they
appear in the text records; the rest of the file is, of course, the various records.
    The fields for the databbase are described below, listed by their name and in the same order that they
appear in the text database.

                 Fields
    The following are the descriptions of the different fields used in this database.  All fields are
text types, with single line records, except for "Properties" which is text but is a milti-line memo field
with possible carriage returns within it's text field (which my database program comverted to those occasional
funny looking symbols you see therein).

    Name:  the name of the material in question.  The name used is the common name by which it is known,
though there are a very few (about a dozen or so) that I give only the botanical names for; this is
because those where the only names I found (if anyone knows the common names for these scientific ones
then please tell me and I will update the database accordingly).
    Botanical_Name:  The botanical name of the herb in question (where applicable and where I could find one).
    System_Affected:  A general overview list of the general types of bodily systems affected by the
material.
    Properties:  The specific properties and reputed effects and uses that it has.
    Description:  A general description, where available, of the her or material in question, and
sometimes which part of the herb is to be used.
    Origin:  The origin, when given, of the herb; where in the world it originated from.
    Notes:  Any other notes on the material, preparation, warnings on use, etc.
    Toxicity:  The toxicity, if any, of the substance, or any warnings regarding overdose.  "None" means
that it definitely has no toxic side effects, but if nothing is given in this field (whether an actual
effect or the worn "none"), then it means that I have found no mentioned toxic side effects but neither
did I find an EXPLICIT mention of no toxicity; however, if this field is blank then it is most likely
non-toxic (since I'd found none mentioned in any texts).
    Dosage:  A new field added in from the original database, the recommended dosage is given here (for
cases in which I was able to find one).  In some cases the dosage is in the form of a tea that can be
made from that herb and then drunk; in such a case the keyword "Tea" is followed by the a ratio of herb
to water.  If an herb can be taken both in a given dosage and as a tea then both will be given.
    Type:  The general type of the material.  At present the possible entries in this field are "Herb",
"Vitamin", "Mineral", "Animal" (for any animal products or animal-derived substance), "Amino Acid",
"FruitVeggy" (for any fruit or vegetable), "Enzymes", and "Other" (for anything else that doesn't fall neatly
into the previous categories).

        Future
Email me corrections or additions on things and I'll add it in for any
future updates.  In the meantime, spread this as far and wide as you care to.

          Disclaimer
    Insert you favorite disclaimer here.  Basically I don't claim that anything mentioned here works or
will do anything more than taste funny. So, don't go writing to me if your hair falls out or your dog
turns purple.

           Anywhere
    If you like this database, find it useful, or just like sending things, then email me, send me money,
prizes, or cereal box surprises, or whatever suits your fancy, and then re-upload this entire archive to
somewhere else.
