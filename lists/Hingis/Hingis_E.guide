@node UZYTEK "How to use this database ?"

 
This database is a simple (???) TurboCalc Sheet. It is divided onto three parts:


 
 
     I. Martina Hingis singles matches database

 It is the main part of the program. It contains data about all matches
played by Martina Hingis in season 1999, including such data as: tournaments, dates,
rounds, opponents and their nationality and, of course, results, and sometimes
also some special remarks, concerning a match. Above of this, there are statistics
showing...See it for yourself - everything is explained there.


 
  In column <Tournament> there is the name of a tournament, which Hingis played in.
If it is green, it means it is part of the Grand Slam. Included is also
Chase Championships tournament, which closes the season. If the name doesn't fit -
- just change the font to 15pt.

  In column <Round> I sign the round, which is concerned. Sometimes instead of
round number I write a text such as R128. It means that, in that round, there
compete 128 opponents (Grand Slam).

 
  Following 3 columns (<Date>, <Against> i <From>) don't need any info.

 
  Next, there are 3 columns that show results of each of the 3 sets played.
Women, excluding one tournament in a season (@{fg shine}Chase Championships@{fg text}),
play always to 2 sets won (best of 3). Sets won by Hingis are shown, as brown ones,
and sets lost - as red. Because of problems, caused by Turbo Calc, the results
must be preceeded by @{fg shine}="@{fg text}. With tiebreak, after a result in games I
show in brackets a result of the tiebreak. If a match is surrendered, then after no. of
games won by the giving up player I put the letter 'K' (ie. 3:1K - won by Hingis; 3K:5 - lost).

  After sets columns there is a place for remarks.


 
 
 II. WTA Tour Ranking


  The table contains 20 first ranks of the WTA Tour, with points of each of the
competitors and a loss to the previous one. Unfortunately this table needs to be
updated manualy (using drag&drop, offered by TurboCalc).
 

 III. Other (Stats, bios)

  No comment for that.
