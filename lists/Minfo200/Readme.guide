@node intro "Introduction"

 What is it for?

       This  review  has  been made primarily for  my own use to help me
       to select an appropriate module easily without search.  This list
       might be useful for some people  so  I made it available  for the
       public.  I  keep  the  list  up  to date  and  you  can  send  me
       suggestions and new information - the list certainly has mistakes.
       However I don't want any comments on my taste of music.

       When  the  time  passes, the  mood  changes so  the  line  of  my 
       criticism  may not  have always  been constant thus I have judged 
       every module at least twice.
