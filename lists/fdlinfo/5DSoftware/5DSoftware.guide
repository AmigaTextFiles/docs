@{i}@{fg highlight}Dear Programmer@{ui}@{fg text}

Thank you for dowloading our information archive.

5th  Dimension  was  setup  to  produce  and  supply high quality, low cost
software  to  all  Amiga  users.   We've  selected  the  very best from our
collection  including  titles  that have already sold well in other schemes
and  also  some  brand  new  commercial quality titles.  We hold to date 34
titles, quality not quantity is our motto. We also advertise in all popular
Amiga based publications and our distributors are encouraged to promote all
5D titles to the full.

Our main website is located in the UK at:

                     @{fg highlight}http://www.ware5d.demon.co.uk@{fg text}

Please surf across and browse through the pages to get a better idea of the
sort of software we sell.  You can even download some of our demos to check
on their quality.

Here's  how  it  all works.  The retail price of a one disk title is £3.95,
with  £1.25 going to the  programmer,  £2.45  to  the retailer, and 25p for
administration.   You  will receive payment from the sales of your title(s)
every  forth month, by direct bank transfer (if you hold a UK bank account)
if  the  value is £10 or less the amount will rollover to the next pay day.

The dates for payment are the 1st of:

                                  APRIL
                                  AUGUST
                                  DECEMBER


The  complete  title  should  be  sent  in for evaluation and if accepted a
couple  of  things  need  to  be done to each disk to help protect both our
interests.

1.  The official 5D disk icon to be added.
2.  The official 5D title screen to be added.

I hope that the above will be of interest to you.

I  would  also  recommend  if  possible, a cutdown PD version, to spread to
other  libraries  and  5D distributors.  A screenshot of your program would
also  be  appreciated,  to aid in magazine reviews and advertising.  Please
remember  that  signing  the  agreement  gives  5th  Dimension Software the
exclusive right to sell the title.

@NODE "evaluation" "5D Evaluations"


@{i}5D Evaluations@{ui}
@{i}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ui}

When a program is received for evaluation, it's tested immediately by myself
and a few notes are taken down containing program type, presentation,  first
impressions, and value for money. All that takes place early in the  morning
before any work as begun, so nothing is decided just yet.

When  customers  pop  in I'll show them the title and jot down any  comments
they may make, good or bad.  At the days end when all is quiet  I'll load up
any  evaluations  and  this  time go through them with a  more critical eye,
again  making  notes  and looking for the  hidden features which make a good
program into a great program.  Running this  business as given me an eye for
what's hot and what's not in the crazy world  of computer software.  Some of
the programs may be good,  but not good enough for the scheme, others may be
not  suitable  to sell as licenceware.   This doesn't mean they are rubbish,
just not able to join the 5D scheme  and if this happens alternative ways of
marketing may be suggested.  Either way you can be  sure that you'll receive
an answer from me quickly to let you know just what as been decided.

If  you  would  like  to  submit one  of your programs to the 5D scheme then
please read the following notes.


1.    Make  sure that you include your name,  address, telephone number, and
      if possible E-Mail address.

2.    The complete program must be sent in for evaluation, no PD  or cutdown
      versions, I can then see just what's on offer to the customers.

3.    Include a description of the title, ie number of levels, hardware
      required, is it new!

4.    Tell me if there are any cheats to allow access to later levels ;)

5.    Use the AmigaDOS filing system OFS/FFS depending on target machine.

6.    HardDrive installable is prefered, but not essential.


All  the  above  points will allow me to check your program to the full, if
the program is accepted an official 5D screen will have to be added, so the
disk will need to have some free space.  So that's all there is to it, some
titles  are  signed  up  and  on  sale  within  weeks,  others require more
development,  which  I'm  always  happy to help with and may take months to
reach the public.  If you've got something finished send it in now and I'll
take a look.

Don't  forget that all  5D programmers receive a 20% discount off any title
in  the  scheme,  that's another great reason to join us.  Don't delay join
today and order some of the best value Amiga titles around for even less!!

@{i}Required Now@{ui}
@{i}~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ui}

All  program  types  are  welcome  at the moment, but one or two are really
needed.   If  you've  got  one  of the following then please send it in for
evaluation.

1.    I'm a big fan of racing/driving games, infact I love'em. The scheme
      would benefit from a car racing game and the whole world is waiting
      for a good motorcycle racing game. Someone must be able to produce
      one, so please send it in.

2.    Educational software is always needed, specially for the 5-9 year age
      groups, parents ask for these all the time.

@NODE "history" "5D - History"


@{b}-- 1994 --@{ub}

Way back in the winter of 1994, trouble reared it's loathsome head over our
beloved  Amiga.   The  good times had gone and with them the support of all
the  large software companies, their attention now turned to the PeeCee.  I
had  used  the  Amiga  since  the first WB1.2 A500 in the late eighties and
always supported the machine and PD markets, during 1994 I decided to leave
my  job  and started my own Public Domain library called "SaddleTramps PD",
which  is  still a very active and successful company in it's own right.  I
quickly  acquired  the  distribution  rights  for  the two main licenceware
schemes  at the time, CLR and F1.  It soon became clear that the CLR scheme
was,  shall we say, in a bit of trouble.  It was losing all the support and
respect  of  it's programmers and was consequently going to close.  At this
point I decided to start a new company and so 5th Dimension Licenceware was
born.



@{b}-- The Beginning --@{ub}

I  contacted many friends, programmers, and customers to find out just what
they  expected  to  gain  from either submitting titles to or buying titles
from  5D,  the  response  was  amazing!!   Ideas came in thick and fast and
gradually  I  was  able to create an exiting new structure to suit everyone
programmers, distributers, customers, and even little old me ;) Competitors
though  that the aggressive pricing structure and the complete new approach
to  licenceware  would  never  work,  but  as  you  see to their dismay, it
did.

The main battle plan is simple,  5D can produce high quality Amiga software
for  a  retail  price  that  anyone  can  afford,  if  bought directly from
ourselves  it's  even supplied in a rather smart plastic case complete with
printed  insert  card at no extra cost, so keeping your software investment
safe.   Customers  are  getting  excellent value for money, programmers are
getting  their  titles presented with the respect they deserve, and putting
profits  into  their  pockets  for  all  the  time  spent  in  development.
Everybody wins with 5D and the Amiga is kept alive.



@{b}-- What Now? --@{ub}

It's  over  a  year since the introduction of 5D  onto the Amiga market and
things  are  going  very well, coverage of our titles in the has been good.
The  CLR  scheme  did close and so we were able to fill a gap in the market
and  move along side F1L, who's titles we still support and sell along side
our  own  range.   The  owner  of  F1,  Steve Bye, and myself are always in
contact and operate with a friendly rivalry, both fully committed to seeing
the Amiga back on top.

The  success  of  5D   so  far  does  not mean that we are sitting back and
resting on our laurels, many new titles are in development and great things
are  planned for the coming year.  Our latest release comes complete with a
fully  printed manual (not photocopied) and is written/produced in house by
us to enhance this great new product.

Amivoice  is  a  brand  new invoice/order form creator with some innovative
ideas,  the program saves all the invoices/orders to disk and allows you to
find  any  data  within  seconds,  it can printout a whole days work in one
session, allows you to enter stock codes, plus much much more.  A new paint
package  Belle's  Paint  V2.0  as just been released and some of the titles
will  be  totally  updated for 1996.  One of the main problems I found with
other  schemes  was the repetition of titles in the collection, thus making
an impressively long but misleading program list.  At 5D  we are constantly
looking  at  our  current titles and checking their value in the scheme and
seeing  if  any  improvements  can be made, if changes can be made or a new
version is released then the title is directly updated and not added to the
end of our lists.

This creates a small but perfectly formed collection ;)



@{b}-- The Future --@{ub}

5D   is  now  the  fastest growing licenceware company in the UK.  Our high
standards  and  vigarious testing ensures the released software will always
perform as advertised.  We recieve many letters from customers praising our
excellent  service  and  product  range,  try  us yourself today and you'll
wonder why you didn't try us sooner.

Programmers  are  always  impressed  with  the  care and enthusiasm we show
towards  their  titles.   They also know that if a program is excepted onto
the 5D  books it must be of the very highest quality.

@NODE "copyright" "Copyright"


@{i}Copyright Warning@{ui}
@{i}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ui}

I  check  the contents of all the programs in the scheme and to the best of
my  knowledge,  non  contain any copyright material.  Please make sure that
before  you  send  in  any title it contains only your own work and if not,
then  permission  from the owner to use their work must be given.  Areas to
check are music modules and art work.

Once a program is signed up to the 5D scheme it cannot be sold by any other
company.   This  means  that  5th Dimension Software as exclusive rights of
sale  and  only  5th  Dimension Software and it's official distributors can
legally sell the product.

Official 5D distributors (May 1997) are:

   ALL TITLES WORK ON A500, A500+, A600 and A1200 UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED.
              ALL OF OUR TITLES REQUIRE AT LEAST 1 MEG OF MEMORY


@{fg highlight}Stereop-JR
F1-153
£3.99 (1 disk + DIY 3-D glasses kit)
1Any 1MB Amiga@{fg text}

Stereop-Jr  is  a  creative  art program for children and adults.  It turns
three  normal  IFF pictures into a true stereoscopic (3D) picture, viewable
through  red/blue 3-D glasses.  The User makes the background, middleground
and  foreground of the picture in a paint program (such as Deluxe Paint) or
uses  the supplied pictures and loads them into Stereop-Jr.  The processing
is  interesting  to  watch  and  produces  pictures  with  an immediate and
absolutely  amazing  three-dimensional  effect,  that can be experienced by
everyone  with  normal  vision.   Just process the pictures, put on your 3D
glasses, wait about 20 seconds for your eyes to focus and you will then see
a  stunningly  3D picture that you can put your hand 'inside', the pictures
look  like they are not even on the screen.  Rated 96% and 93% in the Amiga
press.   The  program  includes  a  stereoscopic  interface, an illustrated
on-disk  User  Guide  and  a  simple  stereoscopic  game.  Please note that
Stereop-Jr  makes  TRUE  STEREOSCOPIC  pictures  and has nothing to do with
magic  eye  pictures  or  random dot stereograms.  @4Demo version available
with 3D kit, please add an extra stamp to cover the cost of the 3D kit.


@{fg highlight}Scavenger II
F1-152
£3.99
Any Amiga, Joystick required.@{fg text}

A rather cool scrolling Asteriods clone with some rendered graphics.  Scav2
is  a  huge  Asteriods game with a difference.  You have to survive 12 huge
scrolling  levels by destroying asteriods, collecting powerups and avoiding
the guardians.  Hard drive installable.


@{fg highlight}Dark Citadel
F1-151
£6.99 (4 disks)
1MB chip (i.e NOT A500) Joystick required.@{fg text}

This  is  one  of  the  best  games  we have seen for a long time.  It is a
Valhalla  type  adventure  game  with real-life digitised speech.  The main
character is very cute and entertaining.  There are 3 massive levels to the
game (each level takes up a whole floppy disk) You must guide your animated
character  around  the  screens  examing,  eating and picking up objects to
manipulate  other objects in order to solve the puzzles.  You can also save
your  game  at any stage.  Dark Citadel is hard disk installable (runs much
better) and comes with an easy to use installer.


@{fg highlight}Sorefist
F1-150
£3.99
Any 1meg+ Amiga, A1200 recommended (speed wise).@{fg text}

This  beat  'em'  up  is  a  tribute to the best game of its era, RENEGADE.
Renegade  was a smash hit on the 8 bits and this conversion is really close
except  for the enhanced (i.e colour) graphics.  There are five hard worlds
to  conquer  with four difficulty levels and a 'turbo' mode in case you are
really in the mood to kick butt.  Joystick required.


@{fg highlight}Distant Drums
F1-149
£3.99
Any 1meg+ Amiga.@{fg text}

Distant  drums  is  a  small war game.  You have four worlds to conquer and
each  world  has  21 towns.  Each game will not take long to finish, it was
designed  for  short  games  just  to  pass  a  few hours away, rather long
labourious  conquests.  To win a game in Distant Drums you must capture all
21  towns  on  each  world.You  have  at your disposle, soliders, horsemen,
weapons and a set amount of cash to carry out your campaign.


@{fg highlight}Above Top Secret
F1-148
£3.99
Workbench 2 or higher.@{fg text}

Above Top Secret was produced using Q:Whiz!, a simple quiz creating utility
available  from  F1,(see  F1-140)  and  shows  what  kind of results can be
achieved.This  disk  is  a stand-alone product and does not require Q:Whiz!
to work.

Above  Top  Secret  is  a  quiz  disk  completely  devoted  to Sci-Fi.  500
questions are available, consisting of the following subjects:

* Alien: 50 questions on the first (and best?) of the Alien films.
* Blade Runner (BRDC-92): 100 questions on the cult movie
* Doctor Who :100 questions covering the classic Doctor Who films & TV
* Red Dwarf :100 questions on the popular Red Dwarf television series
* Star Wars :50 questions covering the Star Wars trilogy of films
* The X-Files (Season Two):100 questions on the cult TV programme


@{fg highlight}Pot Luck 3, Data Disk
F1-147
£3.99
Requires F1-065, THE ULTIMATE QUIZ II.@{fg text}

This  disk  contains  500  new  questions  and 1500 answers for the popular
Ultimate  Quiz  II.   As  the  title suggests the questions are of a random
subject  matter.   As  a  bonus  also  on this disk you will find a updater
program  to  fix  a  bug or two in Ult Quiz and allow you 9 playing credits
instead of three.


@{fg highlight}Classic Pucman
F1-146
£3.99 (1 disks)
Any Amiga.@{fg text}

This is a really great game.  The greatest and most simple arcade game ever
written  is  faithfully  reproduced here which even includes the exact same
sound  effects  as  in  the  original  arcade  game.  Every detail has been
reconstructed from the colours and graphics to the level design.  But there
are  added  features  too such as options to play in different modes 'Super
Pacman' 'Arcade' etc.


@{fg highlight}Keith's Quest
F1-145
£6.99 (4 disks)
A1200 or A4000.@{fg text}

Another  great Point & Click Graphic Adventure game.  Thos one was inspired
by Relics Of Deldroneye, Jasper liked Relics so much he decided to make his
own  adventure  in a similar vein.  As you must of guessed it is very good,
otherwise  it  wouldn't  be  in  the  F1  scheme  of  course!  The game was
originally on 6 disks but using a good compressor the the lot now fits on 4
disks.  You have plenty to do with nearly 6 megabytes of adventuring, there
are  53  locations, many of them huge scrolling ones, 16 pieces of original
music,  a  mapscreen,  bonus in-games including beat-em-up, shoot-em-up and
exploration  games.   Keith was 2 years in the making and it shows.  A very
good  game  indeed, Amiga Format, CU and Computing absolutely LOVED it, you
will too.


@{fg highlight}Edword Pro V4.1
F1-144
£3.99
Any Amiga.@{fg text}

This older, bargain priced, but FULL version of Edword Pro is for people
that do not have Workbench 2 or are on a budget.


@{fg highlight}Boris Ball Extra Levels
F1-143
£3.99
REQUIRES BORIS BALL, F1-133.@{fg text}

This  disk  contains  600  new levels for perhaps the greatest bat 'n' ball
game  ever.   If  you  have  Boris  Ball  you  will know just how exciting,
addictive  and  fun  filled  it really is, and why its nearest rivals don't
even  come  close in terms of sheer playability.  This disk in effect gives
you  six  new complete versions of Boris.  These funtastic boards are about
as  WILD,  WEIRD  and WACKY as you are going to get, and will engage you in
many  happy  hours  of absolutely superb game play.  Each set of boards has
taken  P.  Whitfield hours on end to produce (considerably longer than most
people  would  probably  be willing to spend designing their own boards) in
order  to  get  them  absolutely  perfect  -  and  the  results  speak  for
themselves!   Presented  on  this essential data disk for any Boris fanatic
are  600  of  the  very  best  boards; all highly imaginative, original and
exciting.   To  install  the  boards all you need do is double click on the
install icon and insert your Boris disk, it couldn't be easier.


@{fg highlight}The Experiment
F1-142
£5.99 (3 disks)
Any 1meg+ Amiga.@{fg text}

At  last  GRAC  created adventure games are starting to appear, expect more
soon.   The  Experiment  is  three  disks of excellent adventuring, not too
difficult  but  challenging  enough  to make it enjoyable to solve.  In the
game,  you  play  the part of Bud Lightning - clean cut, shade wearing, all
round  nice-guy as he tries to save a Primitive Tribe from extinction after
his  base  is  attacked  by  the  nasty  Stingons.  Good graphics/music and
competently  designed,  this  will keeo adventurers quite for a while.  One
for  the collection.  The big bonus with the Experiment is even A500 owners
can play.


@{fg highlight}Outfall
F1-141
£3.99
Any Amiga.@{fg text}

This  is  a  brilliant  arcade game, it is a clone of a MegaDrive cartridge
game  that  I  have  never  seen,but  it  supposed to be a close rendition.
Outfall  is  one  of those very simple games that are so very addictive and
great  fun.   Based  on  the  Tetris theme, 'beans' fall down the screen in
pairs,  you manipulate and position the beans into groups the best you can,
4 beans of the same colour together will elimanate that group.  The idea is
to  keep  your 'board' as clear as possible of beans.  Just to add a bit of
spice  the  computer  randomly  throws  in some grey beans to messs you up.
Meanwhile your opponent (or the computer) is busy doing the same on its own
board,  the one who lasts longest is the winner.  There is quite a bit more
to  it  than  that,  but I will let you discover that for yourselves.  This
games  is  very  slick,  written  in  super-fast  Machine  Code and is very
configurable.   For  example  it  supports  1-8  players,  tournament mode,
demonstration  mode,pratice  mode,  3  difficulty levels, Pal/NTSC systems,
acceleration, speed, height adjusters etc.  etc.

@{fg highlight}J-Windows
F1-138
£4.99 (2 disks)
Workbench 2.1 or higher (NOT A2000/WB2.05), Amos Pro and Compiler required.@{fg text}

J-Windows  is  a  huge, previously unreleasd Amos extension designed to let
you easily get at many of the interesting and useful parts of the operating
system.

The  speed  of  the  executables  is the fastest seen yet from an Intuition
extension  and  J-Windows  supports  just  about  every  part of intuition,
including  ListView,  which  is  pretty impressive.  In English, this means
WINDOWS,  AGA  graphics(WB3), proper WORKBENCH support.  J-Windows contains
about  200  new  commands  and  is  a  'PROPER'  extension,  not  a  set of
procedures,  though  this  is arguable since it can use procedures that you
can create through GadstoolBox, not supplied.

F1's  first  golf game, PnP was chosen because of its sheer playabilty.  It
is  very  easy  to get in to, you don't even need to read the instructions,
though  an  in  depth  on-disk  manual is run if you boot up disk 2.  Pnp's
graphics  are  not  top quality but they are good enough, you hardly notice

@{fg highlight}Boris Ball
F1-133
£3.99
Any 1meg+ Amiga.@{fg text}

This  isn't  just another 'Bat 'n Ball' game, it has been written in direct
competetion  to  the  Shareware  hit  MegaBall.   The  author  was tired of
Megaball's  bad  points  (he  lists  them  in the doc file of the game) and
decided  to  correct  themand  Boris  is  the  result.  I found it to be an
exceptional  game in all areas, and I don't mind telling you that each time
I  loaded it to have a 'quick' test I ended up playing it for hours.  Boris
beats  Megaball  and slaughters the commercial (and old) Arkanoid game.  If
you  enjoy  this  type  of game you won't find much better anywhere.  *Load
Workbench first to run this game.  HD installable.


@{fg highlight}Guitar Fret Master Pro
F1-132

GFMaster is a Guitar Scales Tutor, which displays the scale shape along the
neck  and  Tablature  below.   It  contains 141 scales/runs and is aimed at
anyone  with  a  guitar,  and if used along with GCDirPro (F1-069) makes an
ideal package if you are just starting to play.


@{fg highlight}Teeny Weenys
F1-131
£3.99
A1200/A4000@{fg text}

This  game  is  outstanding, from the author of the top selling Magic Paint
Box.   The  graphics,  as  you  would expect are superb, well they would be
since  Mal  is  a commercial artist.  The game itself is great too, it is a
sort of Lemmings/Troddlers/Vikings clone.  This arcade/platform/puzzler has
great sound effects and music and tests the old grey matter somewhat.


@{fg highlight}Ballunacy
F1-130
£3.99
Requires: 1meg+ WB2+.@{fg text}

This  is  a  really  good  and original arcade puzzler & just my luck quite
awkward  to  describe, but here goes anyway.  Each level starts with a free
rolling  ball  that  you  need  to  guide  around  a  maze  type  screen by
manipulating  gates  and  running  the ball into power-ups, fairly standard
stuff  so  far,  but  you can also add your own 'gates' with a click of the
mouse  in  any  position and then swith the gates to manipulate the path of
the  ball  in  various directions.  It all sounds really complicated but it
isn't,  it  is  a  really  simple game to get into and really enjoyable and
addictive.   The  graphics are very nice and to top it all you even get the
level  designer chucked in so you can contine where the programmer left off
and  create  as many new levels as you want, the game comes with 20 levels.
The  designer is a doddle to use by the way and no programming is involved,
just mouse clicks.  Highly recommended.


@{fg highlight}LottoBase
F1-128
£3.99
Requires: Any Amiga.@{fg text}

A  very nice and easy to use UK Lottery number database.  Already contained
in  the  database are all the number up to week 66 (Feb 17th 96) It is very
easy  to  input  new numbers as the weeks progress and the program can tell
you  about  the current hottest & coldest numbers and a unique 'Mix' option
of  a  prediction  based  on  both.   A very simple program that anyone can
maintain as a record of the lottery.


@{fg highlight}Tell the Time
F1-127
£3.99
Educational (5-9 years approx)
Requires: Any 1 meg+ Amiga.@{fg text}

TELL THE TIME is based purely on helping Children to learn to tell the time
and  consists  of  five  levels.  Rather than follow the normal trend where
certain  levels  have to be completed before moving on, this program allows
the  `User'  to decide which level he/she wants to do and for how long.  By
pressing  the  ESC(ape)  key  at  certain times during a level, you will be
returned  to  the  Level  Screen.   The  five levels contain sub-games of a
platform  game,  shoot-em-up,  breakout  and  a  great  'watch  the  train'
animation.  All these treats need to be earned though, by correctly telling
the time.

The  purpose of this program is to give a brief coherent account of history
from  the  moment  of the creation of the Universe to the present day.  The
whole  program  is  represented  graphically by an imaginary "road" that is
exactly  one  mile  long.   This  mile  represents  the 15 billion years of
evolution since the creation of the Universe.

@{fg highlight}The Intuition Extension V1.3a
F1-120
£3.99
Any 1MB Amiga + Amos/Amos Pro@{fg text}

Straight  from the USA, this wicked Intuition extension for Amos has been a
well kept secret from the Amos world for quite a while now.  Unless you are
a  regular to the Aminet (Dev/Amos) or on the Internet Amos Mailing list, I
doubt  very  much  if you have even heard of this great extension.  In some
ways  it is similar to Intos, that is in its ease of use, on the other hand
Intos  is very slow compared to this and the IE is a REAL extension and NOT
just  a  set of procedures.  So, if you want professional looking Workbench
style programs in Amos this is the one to get.


@{fg highlight}Parasite
F1-119
£3.99
A1200/A4000@{fg text}

Black Dawn is back again!  This improved vrsion is now 1 or two players and
has  "layered"  levels.   If  you don't know what a Black Dawn game is then
take  a  peek at F1-115 and F1-085/86, needless to say it is as good as the
rest of the BD's, if not BETTER!


@{fg highlight}Absolute Beginners Guide To Workbench 3, Vol 4

This  volume  covers the use of AmigaDos, how to handle archivers and cover
disk  archives  easily,  how  to create AmigaGuide documents, discussion on
programming   languages,   script  writing  and  how  to  create  your  own
compilation  disks  &  more inter-related subjects.  Comes with a free full
*exclusive*  to F1 program called Extractor which allows total beginners to
handle archives easily.


@{fg highlight}Epsilon 9
F1-117
£4.99@{fg text}

An  Amiga  with  at least 1Mb.  Users with only 1Mb may miss out on some of
the  animation  and  music.   Recommend-Second  drive  or (preferably) hard
drive, 2Mb ram, 020 but not essential:  processor or better.

Epsilon  9 is the sequal to the PD hit Starbase 13.  Don't worry though the
graphics  are  excellent  this  time and the game is even more challenging.
Epsilon 9 is a Monkey Island style adventure game and is absolutley superb,
it could even given Relics Of Deldroneye a run for its money!


@{fg highlight}Willys Weirdy Nightmare
F1-116
£3.99
A1200/A4000@{fg text}

Willys Weirdy Nightmare is based on the classic Spectrum platform game 'Jet
Set  Willy'.   This  version,  however,  is  greatly enhanced.  Some of the
features you can expect are :-

* Approximately 500k worth of 64 colour graphics
* Loads of puzzles, hidden rooms etc.
* Save and load feature
* Good, solid gameplay (unlike some games nowadays !)
* Well over 150 levels !
* Loads in one go - no loading levels from disk
* A lot faster than the original


@{fg highlight}Black Dawn 6 - HELLBOUND
F1-115
£4.99 (2 disks)
A1200/A4000@{fg text}

So  now  is YOUR chance to play what has been described as the best BD game
ever.   It  certainly looks good and plays great.  If you don't know what a
Black Dawn game is like yet (where have you been living, in a cave?) it's a
kinda  Dungeon  Master clone, you rove around a 3D tunnel type maze thingy,
kicking butt and running away a lot.


@{fg highlight}Dialog Procedures V4.0
F1-114
£3.99
Requires Amos or AmosPro (NOT EASY AMOS)@{fg text}

Another  treat  for Amos users.  These procedures were designed and written
to  allow the user to incorporate a fully working button interface in their
AMOS programs.  The main advantage about using these procedures is that you
do  not  need  to install a separate extension, and also you do not need to
address  the  Workbench  Intuition System, so that makes it a lot easier to
create  fully  working screens with simple command procedures.  As an added
bonus  the  system  works  a  LOT faster than operating intuition from Amos
using  an  extension.  All the bits that you would expect are included like
windows, 3D boxes.  file requester etc.


@{fg highlight}Amos AGA Extension (Build V.312)
F1-113

AGA AMIGA REQUIRED (A1200,A4000) + Amos Classic or Amos Professional.@{fg text}

NOTE: F1 its distributers or M.Prince do not wish to mislead anyone, this
      program is far from completion, there is as yet no support for bobs
      and sprites, however there are 22 commands (listed below) and more in
      development. New commands for this extension will depend on how it is
      supported.

The  classic  Amos  coders  bible continues going from strength to strength
with  another  packed  issue  of  Amos  programmers hints, tips, tutorials,
opinions,  articles,  problems  solved,  free professional graphics, and of
course the obligatory bucket load of cool source code.  A must for any Amos
coder, beginner or professional.


@{fg highlight}Return to Zantis
F1-111
£3.99
A1200/A4000@{fg text}

This  is  NOT  Relics  Of  Deldroneye  2,  it  is  what  the author calls a
"Link-Sequel".   In his words, it is to keep quite all the people screaming
at  him  and  us  to  get Relics 2 done.  As R2 is taking a lot longer than
anticipated  Lee  has  decided to release this new Relics mini adventure to
keep  all  you hungry fans busy until R2 is ready.  Players of the original
Relics  will  feel  right at home with Return To Zantis, Zantis is the main
town in Relics remember.


@{fg highlight}Codename Nano
F1-041A
£3.99
A1200/A4000@{fg text}

Let  me  explain the strange Disk no.  The F1 CD has two titles missing, 25
and 41, the authors refused permission.  Codename Nano is a replacement for
Disk  41  on  the  CD, but F1-041 is still occupied by the original disk on
this  list  ,  so  I have named this 41A.  Nano is a thrust style game with
georgous graphics and a perfect difficulty level.


@{fg highlight}Absolute Beginners Guide To WorkBench 3, Vol 3 (Tools)
F1-109
£3.99
Workbench 2+ (WB 3.0 recommended)@{fg text}

This  is  the  third  part of the on-going series of Workbench 3 tutorials.
This  volume  concentrates  on  the  contents  of  the Tools drawer of your
Workbench disk.  It discusses what each program is for and how to use them.
There  are plenty of diagrams and easy to understand explanations.  Lots of
other  general  information is also covered.  This volume also looks at the
contents  of the Commodities drawer and the last part of the Extras3.0 disk
is covered.


@{fg highlight}Push and Pull
F1-108
£3.99
A1200/A4000@{fg text}

This  is  a  really  nice  looking  1 or 2 player arcade puzzler.  The main
objective of the game is to simply clear each level of nasties by "pushing"
blocks onto them, no quite as easy as it sounds as they appear to be fairly
intelligent  nasties!   .   You start the game with limited "pushing power"
and  have  to build this up by collecting "pills" that are hidden in blocks
that you crush on your crusade.  Other items you may find in crushed blocks
are  Extra  lives/speed  up/immune  and  a  mystery  power up.  Quite hard,
addictive and fun with very nice graphics.


@{fg highlight}AmosZine 8
F1-106
£5.99@{fg text}

The  Amos  legend  continues.   The  longest  surviving  (and growing) Amos
dedicated  disk  mag.   This  is  one of the best issues ever, catering for
beginners  to  "Ace  coder"  there's plenty here for everyone.  Some of the
highlights of this issue are:

* The complete source code to Fortress II the previously unreleased sequel
  to Lee Bamber's mega F1 hit Fortress.
* Tutorials for complete beginners, how to use Amigados libraries, creating
  your own extensions and making music for your programs.
* Exclusive demos of the new POWERBOBS extension And DMC Gold.
* Megabyte+ of cool source code, mostly new stuff written by the AZ team.
* Stacks of articles & a variety of programming subjects and probs solved.
* Lots of freely usable graphics drawn by professional commercial artist.


@{fg highlight}Martial Morphers
F1-104
£3.99
A1200/A4000 ONLY@{fg text}

Here  is  one  for  Beat-Em-Up  fans.   Martial Morphers is a bit different
compared  to your usual Beat-Em-Up type game, here you control TWO fighters
at the same time, which requires a fair amount of strategic violence in the
right  place at the right time.  The sprites are IK+ style but again with a
difference,  as  you kick or punch you get some morphing thrown in for fun.
I  must  confess I am not a Beat-Em-Up addict but I enjoyed a few rounds of
this game.  The presentation is nothing short of superb by the way.


@{fg highlight}Tele-Subtitle V3
F1-103
£3.99

Tele  SubTitle  (TS) is a Video SubTitler meant for people, who just have a
basic  video  set up - I.e.  A Camcorder, A GenLock, An Amiga of course and
that's  about  it - and just want to SubTitle friends video films, etc with
as much ease as possible.

TS  is  very  easy to use.  You simply pick your subtitles from a main menu
until  you  have built up a Sequence and then you press the Test/Play icon,
which will send you to the `Total Control' part of the program.  From there
you simply use a set of sequence keys to display your subtitles, etc.  It's
as easy as that!


@{fg highlight}Introducing Workbench V2.0
F1-101

WorkBench 2 or 3, i.e. NOT A500@{fg text}

This  new  version  comes  on  four disks packed to the brim with info that
covers  virtually  every  aspect  of Workbench 2 and 3.  There are now many
more  diagrams  (taking  up a whole disk in fact) A complete Amigados guide
and  reams  and  reams  of  text,  featuring  hints  and  tips and in depth
information  on general usage of the Workbench.  What made the original Int
Wb  so  popular  with the press and public was it's unique way of loading a
simulation  of Workbench and when you attempt to run a Workbench program it
displays  all the information relevent to that program, rather than running
the program itself.


@{fg highlight}Atomic II
F1-100
£3.99
Any 1meg+ Amiga.@{fg text}

This  is  a splendidly simple and fun puzzler.  Simply set up a sequence of
switches  and guide coloured balls to their correct homes.  It's quite easy
at  first,  which  is  what  makes  it  so addictive, but gets to be a real
challange  later.   100  levels with password support.  A nifty little game
suitable for anyone of any age.

Grac user disks buy this!


@{fg highlight}Gonks
F1-098
£3.99
A1200/A4000 ONLY@{fg text}

This  is  an excellent game, its a sort of cross between Lemmings/Troddlers
and  Lost  Vikings.   The  idea  is  to arrange blocks & scenery items like
ladders  &  steps  in  such  a  way  so that the Gonk or Gonks can get home
safely.   This all has to be done within a time limit of course and you get
to  use explosives and things to make things even more fun.  Gonks has good
Lemmings  style graphics and music, has 40 levels and 3 worlds (Lego World,
Jungle  world  and  Tiler  world) Very good fun and addictive, gets the old
grey  matter  chugging  after  a  few levels.  Password feature ensures you
don't have to redo the same old levels time and again.

@{fg highlight}Zonal War
F1-093
£3.99@{fg text}

This  is  a  direct copy of a Spectrum classic strategy war game called War
Zone.  It is extremely simple to play, but furiously addictive, like all of
Daves  games  are (see 92 and 21).  The game is set over 9 sections and you
play  the  computer  taking turns to strategically move your men and armour
and  basically  destroy  the enemy, such is war.  It's a very clever little
game  and  the gameplay superbly crafted, just as the Spectrum version was.
A  nice  touch  is  the 'Air Attack' you are allowed once each turn.  Sound
samples are used to good effect.


@{fg highlight}Premier League
F1-092
£3.99@{fg text}

If  you  know  of a PD game called Premier Picks you already know what this
game  is about.  The author wrote this clone because he was sick of Premier
Picks crashing on him all the time.

Premier League is a fun football game, using a blend of skill & chance, you
must  take  your  selected  team  to  the  top of the league.  Each match's
highlights  are  decided by selections of cards on wether you score a goal,
give a penalty away or a free kick etc.  The skill bit is trying tpremember
the  positions  of certain cards.  It sounds drab, but I bet you have never
played a more addictive fotty game or had so much fun.

@{fg highlight}Ghostslayers
F1-088
£3.99@{fg text}

Ok,   hands   up   who  played  the  original  Ghostbusters  game  on  your
C64/Spectrum?   Go on admit it, it was fun and it was good.  In fact it was
one  of  the  most  succesful  8  bit  releases  ever.   Ghostslayers is an
unashamed  rip-off  of that game (but with more colours of course) It still
retains the essential gameplay.  Basically you open a business account, buy
a car and equip it with all the ghost busting weapons you can, drive around
town  looking for ghosts, nip into buildings and kick ghost-butt, catch the
ghosts  in your ghost traps and take them back to HQ.  Once the cities "PK"
level  has reached 1000 you have to tackle the Gatekeeper and the keymaster
etc.   you  know  the score.  Who needs a spectrum emulator?  At least this
one runs at a good speed.

The  previous  games  in  this  series  were:   Black Dawn (PD), BD Special

Black  Dawn.  It has been written and vastly playtested & improved over the
past 2 years, many, many people (20+) on the 'scene' have helped out in its
production, so you can be assured that this game is honed to perfection.

Legions  Of  Dawn  is  a mega-atmospheric single-player 3D roleplaying game
viewed  from  first  person  perspective - in other words as though you are
'inside'  the game world and viewing it through your own eyes.  The various
futuristic constructions that you must attack and defeat are represented by
complex  maze-like  networks, composed of corridors, rooms, doors, computer
terminals...  a whole array of exciting and fully interactive elements.  In
a  nutshell, its a kind of Doom clone with tons of gore and atmos, navigate
through  the  corridors  wasting  all  the  bad  dudes  and collecting more
powerful weapons/cash/goods, logging on to computer terminals and generally
being a very bad person, then make your way to the exit.

has been converted to English exclusively for F1 Licenceware.  Colour Maths
is  basically  very simple.  The child is presented with a number of "Paint
by  number"  style  pictures  to colour in, the catch is, to colour in each
part  of  the  picture  the  child  has  to solve a sum.  The early screens
concentrate  on  simple  counting, addition and subtraction.  Later screens
contain  division, mutiplication and also a mixture of different sums.  The

explain.   Everyone  must  of  played,  or  at least seen a Dizzy game from
Codemasters,  giddy  is  a  snipe  at  the Dizzy games and in most cases is
better.   Move around the scenery picking up objects and solving puzzles by
manipulating  objects.   For example you must find a bucket of water to put
out  a  fire.   The graphics are great, with good use of colour.  Giddy was
coded  in  pure Assembly language meaning super smooth animations and slick
gameplay.   Every  kid  loves  a  dizzy game and soon every kid will want a
Giddy game.  Giddy is a craze just waiting to happen.  A great platformer.

Good art program for all ages.

@{fg highlight}Multi-player Yahtzee
F1-021
£3.99@{fg text}

O.K this is the dice game Yahtzee, but the big difference here is that this
version supports up to four players, and has some of the best sampled sound
effects  I  have  heard.  In one player mode the computer opponnent plays a
mean  game.   Up  to  four  players  can  play  as human or computer or any
combination  of  the  two.  We got a friend of ours who likes these type of
games  to play test it for us, his response was "Very realistic, absorbing,
addictive  as  well  as  a lot of fun".  Dave King, the programmer, said he
spent nearly six months tweaking the game to perfection, and it shows.


@{fg highlight}Impact
F1-020
£3.99@{fg text}

This  is an original game, best described as a Demolition Derby Board Game,
if  you  know  what  I mean?  No?  I will explain then.  1 to 3 players can
play,  each  controlling  a car on the board, dice are thrown to enable the
distance  you  can  move  around the board (or track if you like) the total
distance you can move Depends on the condition of your car.  There are lots
of  power  ups,  good and bad to be collected on the way round and the main
idea is to smash up your opponnents cars and get them into situations where
they  will  crash into each other or obstacles.  The sound FX and music are
good  and the gameplay is VERY addictive.  One track can take anything from
10  minutes  to two hours.  As I said it`s highly original and great fun, I
have never seen anything like it.


@{fg highlight}Touch `n' Go
F1-019
£3.99@{fg text}

Another  quality  production from Alan Carter (see Art School) This has all
the  ingredients  of  a  great  puzzle  game.   It`s simple in gameplay and
concept,furiously  addictive  and  original.   Contains 100 levels to play.
Also  supports  passwords,  parallax  scrolling  and wicked backdrops, cool
music and sound FX.


@{fg highlight}Relics oF Deldroneye
F1-018
£6.99 (4 disks)
* 2 MEG CHIP ONLY *@{fg text}

If  you  have seen or played Monkey Island/Lure Of The Temptress etc.  then
you  already  have  a  good  idea  of what this game is like.  It`s a mouse
driven  interactive adventure with great graphics, sound fx and animations.
Add  to  that brain numbing but logical puzzles, 64 colour graphics, around
100  locations  and  a dangerously high addiction level and you now have an
even  better  idea.   Relics  is  written  by Lee Bamber, the author of the
highly  rated  game FORTRESS and he admits that RELICS far exceeds anything
else he has written before.

@{fg highlight}Pic Knit
F1-016
£3.99@{fg text}

Ok,  this  program will only be of interest to a few people, but for anyone
who does do knitting this program is a boon.  What it does is allows you to
convert  any  IFF  picture to a knitting pattern, you then print it out and
knit  it.  It's very easy to use and VERY clever.  If you want to show your
mum  how  useful your Amiga is then here is your chance.  Worth every penny
to all knitters out there.


@{fg highlight}Tots Time

the  game  is  to manoeuvre around the screens destroying the defence pods,

enemy base.  In two player mode the fun is blowing up your opponnent in the
rush  to  be  first  to  destroy  the  enemy base.  The big difference with
Obliteratives is you can load in your own custom made IFF screens to use as
the play area giving the game unlmted lastability.

Have you played the best non-commercial adventure on the Amiga?  (Relics Of
Deldroneye,  F1-018)  Yes?   enjoyed  it didn't you!  How would you like to
create  your own graphic adventure game similar or even better than Relics?
Now,  F1  brings  you  GRAC,  The Graphical Adventure Creator.  GRAC is the
first  ever  Graphic  Adventure  creator on any computer.  What!  you can't
program?   Don't  worry  no  programming  skills  are  needed,  though  any
programming   knowledge  will  be  of  benefit.   you  will  need  a  basic
understanding  of  your  Amiga  though.  GRAC supports standard IFF picture
files/sound samples and MOD/MED music modules.

This program is a genuinely brilliant piece of software, Don't confuse GRAC
with  the  old  Adventure creators that have been about for years, at worst
they  allowed  you  to create text-only adventures and at best they allowed
text  and  a still picture.  Grac allows you to create Monkey Island/Relics
style  games  with  ease.  I have personally seen GRAC's inception over the
past  seven  months  and Edmund has put a lot of thought and hard work into
GRAC.   If  you  can  use  Dpaint you can create a game.  GRAC comes with a
complete  game called Lethal Formula written with GRAC to show you what can
be  done.   Also  included  are plenty of example graphics/animations and a
complete step by step tutorial.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a fairly simple scripting language that
is  used to create the Internet WWW pages you see in your browser.  It is a
lot  simpler  to  learn  than  you probably think.  Indeed, the majority of
people using HTML right now have had no previous programming experience.

Amiga Specific Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1st  Steps  With HTML has been written specifically with the Amiga in mind.
It tells what software you will need (All free) and deals with the problems
associated  with  the three main Amiga browsers,i.e the fact that all three
support HTML in varying degrees.

Contents include:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o An A4 comb bound, 50 page book
    o 1 floppy disk containing all HTML examples in the book
    o 120+ GIF/JPG Images for use in your WWW pages
    o Edword Pro Text Editor, superb for writing your HTML (Demo version)

Subjects covered in the book are:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o Text formatting
    o Links & Anchors
    o Lists
    o Discussion on file formats
    o Displaying images
    o Forms, buttons, etc.
    o Tables
    o Fonts
    o Frames (now supported by Voyager NG and soon Ibrowse+AWeb)
    o Further tutorials for free
    o Freebies on the Internet
    o Search Engines

If  you are afraid of Tables and Frames, don't be.  This book will show you
the easy way to write basic Tables and Frames, you will be happily creating
your  own  in  minutes.  This is a unique book, as far as we know it is the
only Amiga specific HTML tutor around and is REALLY IS for the complete and
utter NOVICE.

A PC Specific version should be ready during 1997
