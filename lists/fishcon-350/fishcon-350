MemMometer      A program that opens a narrow window and graphically
                displays your memory usage like a gauge.  Based on
                WFrags, by Tomas Rokicki.

Stitchery       This shareware program loads in IFF images and creates
                charted patterns from them for use in counted cross-stitch
                and other forms of needlework.  It requires one megabyte of
                memory to run, and works best with a good high-resolution
                printer for printing the patterns.  The Stitchery was
                written with The Director and the Projector is included.
                Version 1.21.

TrackUtils      Two utilities that deal with disk tracks.  TCopy copies one
                or more tracks from one disk to another, and is useful for
                copying part of a floppy disk into RAD: during bootup.
                TFile creates a dummy file which "marks" a specified range
                of tracks, preventing AmigaDOS from using them and allowing
                them to be used for raw trackdisk data.  Includes C source.

MemGuard        MemGuard is a MemWatch like program which has been
                rewritten in assembly language for maximum speed and
                efficiency.  Unlike MemWatch, MemGuard does not run as
                task in a dummy loop but rather as a low-level interrupt
                routine which is capable of trapping memory trashing even
                before exec might know of it and even while task switching
                is forbidden.  An update to version III on disk 325,

Berserker       A viruskiller which checks for certain conditions
                indicating possible virus infection.  Different from
                other programs of this kind, Berserker does not rely
                on checksums only, it will also check the possible
                virus behind the altered checksum.  Therefore even new
                viruses with old infection methods can be traced and
                resident tools are not touched.  Includes source in
                assembly language.

ImageEditor     A simple to use graphics editor which allows you to draw
                and save images/sprites as assembler or C source code.
                Includes IFF support, undo, and an iconify function.
                Another feature is the small memory usage so you can multi-
                task on a 512K machine.  Maximum picture size - 166*58 pixels.

OPS5c           OPS5c is a compiler for the expert system language OPS5.
                The compiler takes OPS5 source code as input and creates a C
                source code file to be compiled to create an executable.
                Arbitrary C code may be linked with the executable and
                executed as a result of firing rules.  The system's strong
                point is its speed and as a result it sometimes has large
                executables and large memory requirements.  At least 1 Meg.
                of memory is suggested.  Binaries only for compiler and
                run-time library.  Requires a C compiler.
                Version 1.00a.

ReDate          Scans a disk and dates each directory according to the most
                recent item contained within (not including .info files).
                Ideal for use after a COPY ALL CLONE, where the directories
                are CREATED rather than copied and thus lose their date
                information.  Includes source in assembler.

RoadRoute       Revision of trip planner program to find "best road route"
                between any two points of travel.  The user is encouraged
                to customize files CITIES and ROADS to suit travel interests.
                This is version 1.5, an update to the original version on
                disk 251, and makes provision for very large city menus and
                itineraries.  You might like to use files from disk 328
                (Mayes/Delzer).  Also includes RoadScan, a checker for
                RoadRoute files (CITIES and ROADS).  Very large files may
                contain goofs (cities with no roads, the same road entered
                twice, etc.), or oddities (direct road not as fast as multi-
                point).  These are pointed out, together with areas where
                users might wish to make economies in the data base.

ScanIFF         Scans through an IFF file, identifying the elements.
                Faster than standard utility IFFCheck since it uses Seek,
                but does not do IFFCheck's detailed format checking.
                Intended for use as a "template" from which programmers
                can code their specific application.  For example, an
                expanded version has been used to extract instrument data
                from music files.  Includes source in assembler.

ViewDir         A LIST type of utility showing contents of a disk or

                commercially available packages of the same nature.  Many
                of the utilities require a hardware interface that allow
                the Amiga to access C64 peripherals such as disk drives

Oberon          A freely distributable demo version of a powerful Oberon
                compiler.  Oberon is a modern, object oriented language
                developed by Prof. Dr. Niklaus Wirth of ETH Z|rich in
                Switzerland as a successor to Modula-2.  This single pass
                compiler creates standard Amiga object files, uses a large
                variety of optimizations to create fast code, supports
                writing of reentrant programs, allows you to call code from
                other languages like C and Assembler, etc.  The package
                includes the compiler, an editor, a link utility, a program
                to display compilation errors and some demo programs.

CrossDOS        A "tryware" version of a mountable MS-DOS file system
                for the Amiga.  This is a software product that allows
                you to read and write MS-DOS/PC-DOS and Atari ST
                formatted disks (Version 2.0 or higher) directly from
                AmigaDOS.  This tryware version is a "readonly" version,
                which does not allow any writes to the disk.  A fully
                functional version is available for a very reasonable
                price from CONSULTRON.  An update to 3.05b on disk 252.

Msh             An Amiga file system handler that handles MS-DOS formatted

                is a fully functional, read/write version, that supports 8,
                9, or 10 sector disks of 80 tracks, and should also work on 40
                track drives and hard disks with 12 or 16 bit FAT of any
                dimension the FAT allows.  Update to version "1.5" (Release

XLispStat       A statistical program based on David Betz' XLisp. It
                does some of the most advanced dynamic statistical
                graphics, included brushing, linking, and 3D rotations.
                Menus and requestors can be created dynamically with
                simple lisp commands, and treated as lisp objects, so
                that the program could be used for many other non-
                statistical purposes, such as interactive expert
                systems. XLisp-Stat has an ARexx port so that an editor
                may be used to prepare lisp programs and send them
                directly to XLisp-Stat to be executed.  Commands, as
                character strings, may also be sent from XLisp-Stat
                with the lisp command, "arexx".  All graphics produced
                may be saved to files in IFF format.  This version of
                XLisp-Stat (v.2.1, release 1) has been ported to the
