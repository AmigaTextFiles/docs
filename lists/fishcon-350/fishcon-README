FISHCON

The FishCon files are a series of content files from the Fred Fish
collection.  

Each Fishcon file is a collection of the content files from 50 
contiguous Fish disks.  FishCon-001 is a notable exception in that
it only contains the first 49 files (001-049).  Each collection
begins with the FishCon extension number. (e.g. FishCon-250 would
have content files 250 - 299)

The highest numbered FishCon file (currently FishCon-350) will contain
files up to the most current release of Fred Fish disks.

Each FishCon file is paginated into 60 line pages with no form feed
between pages to accomodate the requirements of our local printers.  

The entire series is page-numbered consecutively and contiguously.  
This allows for direct page indexing which has now been added to the 
FishXref for those who wish to use  hardcopy form of the FishCon 
collection and the FishXref.

These changes have been made to reflect currently expressed needs 
of the users of the FishXref.  I hope they prove satisfactory to
the user group at large.
