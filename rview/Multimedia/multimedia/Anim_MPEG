 MP

 Last version: 1.03 fix
 Last changes: since 1.03 (29.IX.93)
               Fix: bug in OpalVision 24bit output
 Locations   : Aminet aminet/gfx/show/mp103.lha
 Arch. size  : 58 kb
 Program type: MPEG 1 Video player
 Requirements:
               Hardware:
                 - Amiga
                 - Kickstart 2.0+
                 - mc68020 or Faster
                 - around 2 meg of free memory (FAST recommented)
               Software:
                 ---
               Recommended:
                 - mc68030/40Mhz
 Output type :
               Graphics:
                 - ordered       use simple ordered dithering
                 - ordered2      a faster ordered dither. This is the default.
                 - mbordered     ordered dithering at the macroblock level.
                 - fs4           Floyd-Steinberg dithering with 4 error values propagated
                 - fs2           Floyd-Steinberg dithering with 2 error values propagated
                 - fs2fast       a faster fs2
                 - hybrid        Hybrid  dithering, a combination of ordered dithering
                                 for  luminance  and  fs2  dithering  for chrominance.
                                 Errors are not propagated properly.
                 - hybrid2       Hybrid dithering with error propagation among pixels.
                 - 2x2           A dithering technique using a 2x2 pixel area for each
                                 pixel.   The  image  displayed is 4 times larger than
                                 the  original  image encoded.  Random error terms are
                                 added   to  each  pixel  to  break  up  contours  and
                                 gradients.
                 - gray          Grayscale  dithering.   The image is dithered into 16
                                 grayscales.  Chrominance information is thrown away.
                 - gray8         Grayscale dithering with 256 grayscales (AGA only).
                 - color         'True' color  display  with 4 bits luminance and 2*2
                                 bits for chrominance.
                 - ham6          'True' color display using HAM approximation. For
                                 each   pixel  either  red,  green  or  blue  are  set
                                 correctly and the other color components are the same
                                 as  the  pixel to the left.  As the name implies this
                                 uses  the  6bit  HAM  mode  and  is  limited  to 4096
                                 possible colors.
                 - none          no dithering is done, no image is displayed. Used to 
                                 time the decoding process.
                 - mono          Floyd-Steinberg dithering in black and white.
                 - threshold     Simple thresholding in black and white.
                 - ham8          'True'  color  display  using  HAM approximation.  In
                                 HAM8  mode  you  have  a  18bit  color  palette for a
                                 maximum  of  256k  colors  produced by mp.  This mode
                                 produces   finer   gradients  than  ham6  but  it  is
                                 significantly slower.

                 - opal15        and
                 - opal24        generate  a 15bit or 24bit display on the OpalVision.
                                 Playback speed is somewhat slower than for the native
                                 Amiga  graphic.  This requires the opal.library to be
                                 present in the LIBS:  directory.
                 - village24     generates  a  24bit  display  on the PicassoII board.
                                 This  requires the PicassoII software to be installed
                                 properly.   You  don't need to redirect the Workbench
                                 to  the  PicassoII  board  nor  use  the ChangeScreen
                                 commodity   as  the  player  directly  talks  to  the
                                 PicassoII  driver  software.   The player will open a
                                 display  as  large as necessary which will be 320x240
                                 for  most  MPEG  files if you have the latest Picasso
                                 software.   I  talked  to the VillageTronic people to
                                 support  a 352x288 mode as well which is the standard
                                 resolution for full screen MPEGs (in PAL).
                                  The  player  cannot  be  retargeted by the Picasso's
                                 Intuition  driver,  so the standard dither modes will
                                 get the native Amiga display.
                 - retina24      generates  a 24bit display on the Retina board.  This
                                 requires   the   Retina   software  to  be  installed
                                 properly.   The player was tested with version 1.3 of
                                 the  Retina  software.   The player uses the standard
                                 screen  dimensions  for  the  24bit display.  You can
                                 change  the  resolution with the Retina software, you
                                 will probably prefer the lowest resolution to get the
                                 largest image size on the screen.
                 - egs24         generates  a  'true  color'  display  on any hardware
                                 supported   by  the  EGS  libraries.   Dithering  and
                                 rendering  is  done  by  EGS  while  the  player just
                                 supplies  the  24bit  raw  data.   If you have an EGS
                                 supported  24bit  board  this means you will see full
                                 24bit.  In any case the _default_ EGS screen is used,
                                 you  can choose the dimensions and depth with the EGS
                                 preferences tools.

               96 pixels or 80 pixels wide animations look awful.

 Other infos :
               In  fact this small program can show you almost everything
               about  any  MPEG file.  It's size, fps, structure, lenght,
               compression  etc.   You  can  use it to check integrity of
               MPEG files.

@title "Speed results for MPEG players"

 All tests have been made on 040/40Mhz. MPEG animations were in RAM
 (XingPlay always reload anim. first) and can be found on Aminet.
 The bigges problem was XingPlay because in my collection of MPEG
 I found only ONE working with it ! I'll try to find FULL SCREEN
 (like warp-s1.mpg) MPEG that works OK on aMiPEG and XingPlay,
 but for now I had to use this:

1) warp-s1.mpg        pix/mpg 1.3M
                         size 352 x 288 pixels
                  compression 1:55.5
                       frames 240

2) bigbend.mpg       pix/anim 352K
                         size 160 x 120 pixels
                  compression 1:30.9
                       frames 193


                GRAY 256     HAM8 1x1     HAM8 2x2    NO DISPLAY
             |--1--|--2--||--1--|--2--||--1--|--2--||--1--|--2--||
-------------+-----+-----++-----+-----++-----+-----++-----+-----++
 ........ MP | 5.32|20.10|| 2.12| 9.28|| -.--| -.--|| 5.41|18.59||
 .... aMiPEG | 4.88|12.70|| -.--| -.--|| 3.99|10.16||10.97|18.47||
 .. XingPlay |  NW |24.31||  NW |11.23||  NW |11.35|| -.--| -.--||
 . mpeg_play | 2.22|10.19|| -.--| -.--|| -.--| -.--|| 4.83|12.95||

 Results are in frames per socond
 -.-- program don't have such a display mode
  NW  program don't want to work with that MPEG

 If you have 24+ bit GFX board you will probably have similar
 results to GRAY 8 bit mode, but if you can please send me
 your's one.
