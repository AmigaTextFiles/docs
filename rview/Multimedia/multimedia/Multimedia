@node XANIM
@title "XAnim 2.69.7.7 22-Mar-95"

1) Where to get:
 - Aminet  253KB   aminet/gfx/show/xanim8.lha

2) What it can play:

   GFX format: Play everything on system screen or window what you can set.
               Uses different kind of FloydSteinberg dithering or simply
               colour and gray modes.

   Video:

	  +  Quicktime Animations.  The  following  features  are
	     supported:
               -> Uncompressed     (RAW ) depth 4,8,16,24 and 24+
               -> Uncompressed     (RAW ) Gray depth 4 and 8.
               -> Apple Graphics   (RLE ) depth 1,8,16 and 24.

               -> Apple Video      (RPZA) depth 16.
               -> SuperMac Cinepak (CVID) depth 24 and GRAY 8.
               -> Component Video  (YUV2) depth 24.

               -> Supports animations with multiple codecs.
               -> Supports merged and separated resource forks.


	  +  AVI animations. Currently supported are
	       ->*IBM Ultimotion     (ULTI) depth 16.
               -> JPEG               (JPEG) depth 24.
               -> Motion JPEG        (MJPG) depth 24.
               -> Intergraph JPEG    (IJPG) depth 24.
	       -> Microsoft Video 1  (CRAM) depth 8 and 16.

          +  MPEG animations. Currently only Type  I  Frames  are
             displayed.  Type  B  and Type P frames are currently
             ignored, but will be added in future revs.

    Also can play a lot of other animations format and pictures streams.

   Audio:

     AVI 8 and 16 bit RAW(PCM) mono/stereo.
     AVI ADPCM is supported(mono only for now).
     Quicktime 8 and 16 bit RAW(PCM) mono/stereo.
     Quicktime 8 and 16 bit TWOS(signed PCM) mono/stereo.
     Quicktime MAC6 is *NOT* supported.

3) Future:

  As far as I know Amiga part of that project is CANCELED. But x11.library
  is still developed and it's main part of program ...

4) On what machines it works:

  Any Amiga with 1 MB memory (hmmm I'm not sure but 512KB can be enought !!!)
  and x11.library (ex. from Aminet)
  I have to write here that XAnim can play lots of animation but it's damly
  slow and have realy nasty sound support (eats cpu like a fresh cookies)


5) How to contact with author:

    If you can think of anything that involves my address:
     Terje Pedersen
     Oterveien 55
     9017 Tromsoe
     Norway

    Podlipec did allow me to ask for a $10 contribution for using my
    libX11 and the efforts needed to port the program, but this doesn't
    seem to have reached the amiga public..Therefore I didn't plan to
    release any more ports of xanim. But some guys on irc showed some
    interest and made me do this one!

    Want to know more about xanim? try:
    http://www.portal.com/~podlipec/home.html  "The XAnim Home Page"

    And thanks to all who has suggested improvements and ways
    to prevent possible problems on other configurations! (thanks Olaf!)

    TP

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  So like you can read above Terje is not such a bad guy and perhaps will
  develope XAnim if we ask him again - worth to try !

@title "Author info"

   If  you  can add something to informations in this guide please
 write to me. Also if you have requested documentations or perhaps
 some IntelIndeo  sources (the biggest problem now) please contact
 with programmers or me (I'll send it to everyone).

 @{b} Send me also EMails if you think that such a FAQ is needed @{ub}

 Currently I'm now something like ;) QT,CyberAVI,CyberQT and AVId
 beta tester, and I'm working on new port of XAnim for Amiga. I'm
 also planing to do IntelIndeo.library so every program can use
 ****** IntelIndeo format.

 you can write to me:
  best
   sauron@pwr.wroc.pl =  sauron@sun1000.ci.pwr.wroc.pl
  also good
   agnen@agnen.mud.org.pl
   sauron@main.ic.com.pl
  not sure one
    agnen@mud.org.pl
  or
    agima@plukwa.pdi.net
   sauron@plukwa.pdi.net

 on irc you can find me:
   #amigapl #rpg-pl on normal IRC servers ;)
   #amiga_warez     on GALAXY IRC servers
 my nick is .... yes you are right SAURON or ^Sauron^ if some other
 ***** will use it already ;)

 If you can't get me there ;) last chance you have on  my MUD, but
 it's POLISH one so you probably don't pass login part but even so
 try 'agnen.mud.org.pl 7680' and ask ... Sauron.
 (name of the mud is Agnen)

 And last word: I don't like TOLKIEN'S trilogy (Herbert is much better)

@node MABroadcast
@title "MainActor broadcast"

  I TOLD YOU NOT YET !!!
  Are you trying to test me ?

  Gee when I will have enought time to test it ;)
  On MAB WWW page there is nothing about supported formats
  (well unless not so precise as I need)

@node Converting
@title "Converting"

@{b}@{i}
1) How to convert AVI,QT to ANIM ?
@{ub}@{ui}

 The easiest way is to use MainActor, you can simply load QT/AVI and
 save it as any other anim/fli/flx format. But if you don't have MA
 or it cannot load current AVI/QT try to use XAnim7beta
"XanimAmigaBet7.lha gfx/show   Xanim for Amiga BETA_7. 3.x+AGA or gfxcard"
 It can save any supported by it anim as IFF pictures (24/8 bits)
 "AmiXanim -Di8BaseName AnimName"   -for  8 bits output (256 colors)
 "AmiXanim -Di24BaseName AnimName"  -for 24 bits output (16M colors)
 BaseName - AmiXanim will create IFF pictures called BaseName.000
            BaseName.001 ... BaseName.009 and so on
 AnimName - path and name to animation

 Now you have to join pictures in animation (there is a lot of programs
 on Aminet that can do that). I used to create anims by ImageFX (it can
 render it quite nice).

@{b}@{i}
2) What about sound ?
@{ub}@{ui}
 
 Now we have a problem. Currently as far as I know ONLY
 MainActorBroadcast have small tool called RipSound that can save AVI
 sounds as 8/16svx samples.

 To save MOV sound you can use QT (ver 1.4+) and AHI file_save
 driver.

@{b}@{i}
3) How to create AVI/QT on Amiga
@{ub}@{ui}

 The ONLY way I know is to BUY MainActorBroadcast ... sorry no other
 solution. I don't know what kind of limitation have DEMO version
 on Aminet, but you can try it.

@{b}@{i}
4) Is there any Amiga animation format that supports sound ?
@{ub}@{ui}

 Yep... it's not popular because of compression lack and no
 good software to create it. You can get a lot of CDXL anims
 from aminet.

 CDXL - it's easy to play format that not needs CPU power, but anims
        are big (size of file)
 FILM - it's simply ANIM and 8SVX mixed together, no compression
        (so FILMs are even bigger than CDXL)
        "AGMSFilm2.lha  gfx/show Makes films from IFF sounds and pix"

@{b}@{i}
5) What can play CDXL/FILM (later perhaps I'll write more)
@{ub}@{ui}

 -CDXL - use Datatypes to play it or "cdgslx" from Aminet (gfx/show)
 -FILM - use Datatypes to play it or "AGSMFilm2" from Aminet (gfx/show)
