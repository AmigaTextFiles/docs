 Light Cycle

 It was small, so I downloaded it, it was meant to be a light cycle sim,
but it would be better as an etch-a-sketch sim.

 You start with a grey screen and you can move around the screen using
the joystick or the keyboard. You can have 3 players (I think) but the
short readme included says nothing about the game, it just tells you to
look at the source.

 I can only find 2 controllers, red, and blue, there's an orange dot as
well, but I don't know how to control that.

 For this to be a good Light Cycle game you would have to be constantly
moving, but you can stop, and do nothing if you want. If there is only
one of you, you could try to block off the red player using one
controller, then swap controllers, and try to get out. Exciting!

 Some type of border would be good, sound as well, oh, instructions
would also help.
