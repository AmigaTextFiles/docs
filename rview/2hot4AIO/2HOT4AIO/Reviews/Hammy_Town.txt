Escape From Hammy Town

This is the first of two reviews of Monkey Island style graphical
adventures this month. This one, is by no means, the better looking, but at
least there is a good adventure underneath the crap graphics.

This one was first reviewed way back in AIO Issue 7, before I was games
editor! I earned a respectful score of 79%. The game hasn`t changed much
since November 1997. It could well be the same game, but head man Chris
would have to confirm that.

The author is not a graphics artist, and is not a programmer either, by the
looks of things. Hammy Town was created using GRAAL. Which is a graphical
adventure creator. I`ve never heard of it, but it must still be supported
as the game uses the latest GRAAL loader program.

There are loads of locations, and lots of characters to meet, but it can be
anoying when the game can`t load a room, this happened to me a few times,
it would be better if you could save the game, but I couldn`t find out how.

The music is exceptable, but in some rooms you are left with no music,
becuase, either the music is a short burst, or there isn`t any!

Graphics      : 30%

Overall       : 80%
