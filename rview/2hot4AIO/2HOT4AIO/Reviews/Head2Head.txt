 Quaker Quest & Dead Land  Head 2 Head

 Quaker Quest and Dead Land are by the same author, they are both
text/graphic adventures, which is best? Find out here...

 Sod reviewing them sepatatly, they are both as bad as each other.
Crapy graphics, inpossibily hard puzzles, dodgy music, dodgy plots,
these are not worth the download time!

 In Quaker Quest you are the last of the Quakers, and you must find some
oats. In Dead Land you are dead. What I find anoying, is that you find
the things you need in one game, in the other game. They are so similar!

 I don't like these, there too hard, and there a waste of time - they're
not even going to get a proper review!
