I was playing Pinball Fantasies from Digital Illusions.
Everything was working fine. I went out, and returned with a friend. I
decided to show him what my A1200 could do, so I loaded Pinball Fantasies
which was already in the disk drive. It loaded fine, but it instantly went
into 8 players. Okay, I thought. We`ll have a practice! I got the ball on
the table. And it kept pausing and unpausing! I didn`t know what was going
on, and he didn`t have a clue. We tried another game, and it worked fine.
Later that day, I was really bored so I played the CU Amiga demo of Leading
Lap, and the same thing happened again. it kept pausing and unpausing when
I wasn`t pressing FIRE. I phoned Analogic, as they are the only Amiga repair
centre in the UK recommended by Amiga International. I told them the problem,
but they had no idea. My friend returned, and we played the P.D game, Blob.
I`m not that good, but he is always going for the players we have on, with
no one playing them (drones). I looked at my Competition Pro joypad that he
was using. The SLOW function was enabled. I remembered reading the
manual, it said that the SLOW function was the same as turning pause on and
off. We stopped playing the game and loading Pinball Fantasies again. It
worked fine!
