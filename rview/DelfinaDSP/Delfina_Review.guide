@Node "Why"
Why I chose Delfina DSP over many other cards available on the market

I've been thinking of getting an Amiga 16-bit sound card for a long time.
I've never even thought of migrating to the PC (with all the bad
experiences I had with this family of computers) and I needed something to
make professional music on the computer. Of course, the fact that Amiga
audio cards are quite expensive was always influencing my selection, so
even though I dreamt about the AD516 which is a legend amongst Amiga sound
cards, I was searching for a better solution.

One day I asked about it on a FidoNet conference devoted to the Amiga, and
got a reply from a guy by the name of Jakub Bednarski whose knowledge of
the Amiga always overwhelmed me, summarising the current Amiga audio cards
market and making some suggestions. Of course the main two cards he spoke
about were the Sunrize AD516 and the Macrosystems Toccata. But he did some
more research on Internet and found a very interesting offer of an audio
card of high quality, with an onboard DSP for an unbeatable price of $400
(limited Internet offer only, suggested retail price was $699), meaning
very little more than a new Toccata costs. He recommended it to me, and
upon initial contact via Internet and reading some more about it I made a
decision to buy the Delfina DSP card from Petsoff Limited Partnership.

You might ask - why did Jakub recommend the Delfina? Well, Toccata has one
"small" disadvantage - no onboard DSP processor, which makes it totally
dependent on the processing power of the Amiga to mix channels and create
effects (therefore you can forget about high quality sound and video at the
same time unless you have a 68060). AD516 might be very powerful and high
quality, but its DSP is non-programmable (so you're stuck with the effects
it has built-in, and there aren't many), the card is not developed, it's
expensive, quite old, has no AHI interface and you're stuck with Studio 16
(which was not needed for my uses of an audio card, which would be mostly
as a sampler to be used together with MIDI instruments). Other cards we
found via Internet were Prelude (which was in the prototype stage then and
has just entered production, besides it's not much better than the
Toccata), Hypersound 32 (a myth, its home page completely disappeared
recently and the authors cannot be found), Sounstage (expensive and
proprietary to use with Broadcaster video cards), Wavetools (not much info
on the Internet concerning this card), Aura (definitely not good enough for
professional quality, and used via PCMCIA, so useless on my A3000 and
A4000) and Maestro Pro (interesting, but for studio purposes due to no
analog input/output, also quite expensive). So there was one logical choice
of a card with a DSP, high quality, SRAM onboard, low price, and, as I
found out later, very good software and service support. It was the Delfina
DSP.

@Node "Overview"
What is the Delfina DSP and what it has onboard

The Delfina DSP, as I already mentioned, is a professional 16-bit sound
card for the Amiga. Its primary uses are for real-time effects,
professional sampling, non-linear sound editing and possibly, with bigger
AHI support, in the future - for games, etc.

The part responsible for AD/DA processing in the Delfina DSP is a CD4215
Codec which can sample with up to 48kHz, has programmable gain and
attenuation and built-in antialiasing and smoothing filters. It delivers
studio quality sound.

What makes the Delfina special is the 40 MHz, 20 MIPS, Motorola 56002 DSP
processor. This DSP can not only deliver massive power for sound effects,
but can also be used by the system for various calculation support. An
excellent idea by the makers of the Delfina was using it to control extra
serial and parallel ports. The reader might notice that 20 MIPS is twice as
much as the AD516 DSP delivers and equal to the power of Sounstage DSP, and
both these cards cost around $1400, while the Delfina only $400. Also,
while the other DSPs are ofthen non-programmable, this one can be easily
programmed by the developers and you also get an assembler for it on
Delfina system disks (along with other utilities already using this DSP's
potential).

Another feature of the Delfina is 192kB 15ns SRAM for DSP uses (expansion
to 384 kB possible). Both of these (DSP and SRAM) make it possible for the
Delfina to function as a full-duplex sound effect which takes almost no
processor time and delivers real-time effects like delay, flanger,
overdrive, compression, equalisation, noise gate, etc.

This revision of the Delfina is based on Zorro-II slots. It means that any
Amiga 2000, 3000 and 4000 user can utilise the Delfina directly, also A1200
users with for example Micronik Zorro-II boards can use this card.

Zorro-II is however a disadvantage in one aspect. The low speed of data
transfer via the bus and lack of DRAM memory onboard are responsible for
the fact that the Motorola DSP cannot really be used for sound mixing
purposes. However, no other card on the market except for the expensive
Soundstage (which has no software for it anyways...) has either DRAM or
Zorro-III slots, and the Soundstage has only 4 MB DRAM capacity. However,
see chapter on @{" Future " link Future} to find out about Petsoff plans to
rectify this situation.

At the back of the card you can find two RCA-type outputs, two RCA-type
inputs, one stereo-jack microphone input and one stereo-small-jack
headphones output.

This revision of the Delfina also has another advantage. It has an extra
connector that contains two extra ports - a serial port and a parallel
port, managed by the Motorola DSP. This means that when you buy Delfina you
can forget about buying an extra multi-I/O card which saves you about $100!
Now this is what I call a good bargain. It so happens I really needed those
ports anyways.

@Node "First"
How I ordered the Delfina and what were my first impressions

I ordered the card, like any advanced computer user these days, via
Internet, using my VISA card. The suitable form and contact addresses are
on Delfina's web page (see @{" Petsoff " link Petsoff} for more
information).

I was surprised at the speed with which Jyrki Petsalo answered my letter. I
faxed the suitable data through to Jyrki, the Visa card was verified the
next day, and the card was sent right away. The speed of delivery was
immense, the card traveled from Finland to Poland in 2 days time (!). Right
after Easter I picked it up from the post office.

The card was sent in a grey cardboard box that looks like a big envelope.
That's good, because it does not draw too much attention in the transport.
When I unwrapped it I found the card in a piece of anti-static and
anti-shock "bubble-foil" together with two diskettes, a bill and short
installation instructions.

The card, upon close inspection, reveals the fact that it is hand-made,
which does not make any difference to its quality. The next revision of the
Delfina will be supposively fully automatically surface-mounted
(see @{" Future " link Future}).

I was not, however, impressed with the installation manual, which is very
short and made of a couple of photocopied pieces of paper bound together.
However, to be honest, when installing the Delfina, I found it much more
useful than the nice manuals you often get from larger companies. All you
really need is there, and software manuals are included in amigaguide
format on the system disks.

@Node "Installation"
How I installed the Delfina

Installing the Delfina card was very easy. All I had to do is insert it
into the slot, attach the extra cables and connector for the ports, then
install the software (standard Commodore Installer) and voila - the card
was working right away. No configuration, no long fights with jumpers, no
nothing. Compared to installing for example Cybervision with Cybergraphics
it was a piece of cake.

The software delivered with the Delfina is based on Magic User Interface
(MUI). Since I am very much a MUI fan it was an advantage to me, some
people might not like the idea that much. One of the disks delivered with
the Delfina is MUI 3.6 installation with a licence for use with the
card.

The other disk contains delfina.library, serial driver (parallel driver is
still Beta but can be requested directly from Petsoff if required), AHI
drivers, A56k assembler, configuration program and an excellent utility
called DelFX, which lets you create realtime sound effects using the power
of the DSP.

The first thing I did was plugging my mic and then my guitar into the mic
slot in the back of the computer and I started playing with DelFX options.
I found them to be incredible for anyone who uses any instruments and needs
real-time effects. Delfina now completely replaced obsolete
foot-pedal-effects like Distortion, Flanger, Chorus, Overdrive, Delay,
Compressor, Noise Gate, and also added a 10-level equalizer! Playing bass
is an immense pleasure with a flanger and delay set to give it that
"Cure"-like sound.

Another good thing is that the Delfina is a pass-through card, which means
that with an extra (not supplied) cable you can connect the Paula outputs
to Delfina inputs and with no configuration, right on startup, Paula can be
heard from Delfina's outputs. If you want interesting effects you might try
playing some modules via the Paula chip and play with DelFX to add delays
or chorus effects to them - real fun.

The backdraw of the current Delfina system is the fact that only one
application can use the delfina library. This means that you cannot use
DelFX with another copy of DelFX or with any other application accessing
the card. This will soon be fixed, as Petsoff is working on a new system
that would allow any number of applications to use the library in parallel,
as long as there is enough SRAM for the DSP operation. If you try anything
like that now all you get is a "Out of Delfina Memory" message.

Concerning third-party applications for the Delfina, there are some on the
market already, and to be honest, not even the Toccata has that many
applications available!. Of course any program that supports the AHI
interface can be used with the Delfina, for example Hippoplayer, play16,
etc. However, the AHI driver for the Delitracker is not working correctly
with the Delfina and users must wait for Delitracker III. All users of the
Delfina card will be granted free licences for DASMP (D.A.S. Module Player)
V4, which is still in development. There is a Delfina version of the
AmiPhone Internet Phone utility as well. Concerning commercial software,
two very strong packages have Delfina support - Octamed Sound Studio and
AudioLab16. Unfortunately the Octamed Sound Studio V1 is the last version
of this program for the Amiga and development is being moved to the PC,
which is not good news for many of us. I am strongly suggesting to Teijo
(author of Octamed) that he implements an AHI interface for Octamed (to
make it possible to use it with newer versions of Delfina for example)
before development is dropped.

I've tested the Delfina with Octamed having a paralelly installed Toccata
card. There was no difference in quality, both cards worked perfectly, but
the Delfina noticeably consumed less CPU time than the Toccata did.

@Node "Summary"
Summary

In summary, I can recommend Delfina to anyone seeking a professional sound
card for the Amiga and having not too much cash in their pockets. The ones
with more cash would better save up for the future Pro version of Delfina
(see @{" Future " link Future}.

With the development of Toccata and Maestro Pro dropped by Macrosystems
(there will be no more cards manufactured), with Prelude and Hypersound in
prototype stages, with no support or any decent software for AD516 and
Soundstage, there is just no other way out. Dealers everywhere are starting
to get more interested in the Delfina, and it is very probable that the
card and its next versions might become one of the most popular Amiga audio
cards on the market quite soon.

It is also worth mentioning that nowhere do you get such good support as
from the makers of Delfina. They can be caught reguraly on IRC (nicks pets
and zuikkis on EfNet, put it in your AmIRC notify window), via email (they
usually answer within 24 hours), they are devoted to the Amiga and it's
good to see that we have small companies that keep us alive through these
hard times and create interesting developments.

Therefore spare these $400 and get yourself some better sound for your
Amiga.

@Node "Future"
Future plans of Petsoff concerning the Delfina

The current revision of the Delfina card is, as said, manufactured
manually. It is also quite expensive for distribution via dealers, where it
would have to cost at least $600 (compared to $400 via direct orders).
Therefore Petsoff plans to release a limited version of Delfina with less
SRAM and no ports onboard (the card is now ready and is undergoing tests).
This version is targetted to be cheaper in retail than the Toccata was.

However, there are also more ambitious plans to create a Delfina Pro card,
which is now in a prototype stage. The card would differ from the current
Delfina by having Zorro III slots and a SIMM socket onboard to be able to
work with up to 32 MB (!) DRAM for samples. This means that all samples
could be transferred to the Delfina for direct access by the DSP, which
means the DSP would undertake the job of mixing, completely relieving the
processor and Zorro slots of any work, which means - possibilities of using
video and other applications in paralel with professional sound.

For more information on these plans contact Petsoff.
