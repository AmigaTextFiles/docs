 In the days of my youth
 I was told what it was to be a man,
 Now I've reached the age
 I've tried to do all those things the best I can.
 No matter how I try,
 I find my way to do the same old jam.

 Chorus
 Good Times, Bad Times,
 You know I had my share;
 When my woman left home
 With a brown eyed man,
 Well, I still don't seem to care.

 Sixteen: I fell in love
 With a girl as sweet as could be,
 Only took a couple of days
 Till she was rid of me.
 She swore that she would be all mine
 And love me till the end,
 When I whispered in her ear
 I lost another friend, oooh.

 Chorus

 I know what it means to be alone,
 I sure do wish I was at home.
 I don't care what the neighbors say,
 I'm gonna love you each and every day.
 You can feel the beat within my heart.
 Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part.

 Leave you when the summer comes along.

 Baby, baby, I don't wanna leave you,
 I ain't jokin' woman, I got to ramble.
 Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I won't be there,
 Really got to ramble.
 I can hear it callin' me the way it used to do,
 I can hear it callin' me back home.

 I know, I never leave you, baby.
 But I got to go away from this place, I've got to quit you.
 Ooh, baby,
 Baby, ooh don't you hear it callin'?
 Woman, woman, I know, I know it's good to have you back again
 And I know that one day baby, it's really gonna grow, yes it is.
 We gonna go walkin' through the park every day.
 Hear what I say, every day.
 Baby, it's really growin', you made me happy when the skies were grey.

 Been Dazed and Confused for so long it's not true,
 Wanted a woman, never bargained for you.
 Lots of people talk and few of them know,
 Soul of a woman was created below. Yeah!

 You hurt and abused tellin' all of your lies,
 Run around sweet baby, Lord how they hypnotize.
 Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been,
 Oh, I love you baby, here I come again.

 Every day I work so hard
 Bringin' home my hard earned pay
 Try to love you baby, but you push me away.
 Don't know where you're goin'
 I don't know just where you've been,
 Sweet little baby, I want you again.

 Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true,
 Wanted a woman, never bargained for you.

 Messin' around with every guy in town,
 Puttin' me down for thinkin' of someone new.
 Always the same, playin' your game,
 Drive me insane, troubles gonna come to you,
 One of these days and it won't be long,
 You'll look for me, and, baby, I'll be gone.

 Your Time Is Gonna Come (4 times)

 Made up my mind to break you this time,
 Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry.
 Do want you want, I won't take the brunt.
 It's fadin' away, can't feel you anymore.
 Don't care what you say 'cause I'm gone away to stay,
 Gonna make you pay for this great big hole in my heart.
 People talkin' all around,
 Watch out woman, no longer is
 The joke gonna be in my heart.

 You been bad to me woman,
 But it's coming back home to you.

 You know that Annie's back in town?

 How the fellas lay their money down.
 Her style is new but the face is the same
 As it was so long ago,
 But from her eyes is a diff'rent smile
 Like that of one who knows.

 Well, it's been ten years and maybe more
 Since I first put eyes on you;
 The best years of my life gone by,
 Here I am alone and blue.
 Some people cry and some people die
 By the wicked ways of love;
 But I'll just keep on rollin' along
 With the grace of the Lord above.

 People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat,
 I don't care what people say, I know where their jive is at.
 One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do,
 It's the way you call me by another guy's name when
 I try to make love to you!
 I try to make love but it ain't no use.
 Give it to me, give it!

 Work so hard I couldn't unwind,
 Get some money saved;
 Abuse my love a thousand times,
 However hard I tried.

 Can't take your evil way;

For such a pleasant stay.

But now I smell the rain,
And with it pain,
And it's headed my way.
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired,
But I know one thing I got to do,

Ramble On,
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song.
I'm goin' 'round the world,
I got to find my girl, on my way.
Been this way ten years to the day, Ramble On,
Find the queen of all my dreams.

Got no time to for spreadin' roots,
The time has come to be gone.
And tho' our health we drank a thousand times,
It's time to Ramble On.

Mine's a tale that can't be told,
My freedom I hold dear;
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air,

And slipped away with her.

 Come on now well let me tell you,
 What you're missing, missing, 'round them brick walls.
 
 So of one thing I am sure,
 It's a friendship so pure,
 Angels singing all around
 My dog is so fine.
 Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
 Spend my nat'ral life with you,
 You're the finest dog I knew, so fine.
 
 When you're old and your eyes are dim,
 There ain't no old Shep gonna happen again,
 We'll still go walking down country lanes,
 I'll sing the same old songs,
 Hear me call your name.

 Queen of Light took her bow
 And then she turned to go,
 The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
 And walked the night alone.

 Oh, dance in the dark of night,
 Sing to the morn    -    ing   light.
 The dark Lord rides in force tonight
 And time will tell us all.

 Oh, throw down your plow and hoe,
 Rest not to lock your homes.

 Side by side we wait the might
 Of the darkest of them all.

 I hear the horses' thunder
 Down in the valley blow,
 I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon,
 Waiting for the eastern glow.

 The apples of the valley hold,
 The seas of happiness,
 The ground is rich from tender care,
 Repay, do not forget, no, no.
 Oh, dance in the dark of night,
 sing to the morning light.

 The apples turn to brown and black,
 The tyrant's face is red.

 Oh the war is common cry,
 Pick up you swords and fly.
 The sky is filled with good and bad
 That mortals never know.

 Oh, well, the night is long
 The beads of time pass slow,
 Tired eyes on the sunrise,
 Waiting for the eastern glow.

 The pain of war cannot exceed
 The woe of aftermath,
 The drums will shake the castle wall,
 The ring wraiths ride in black,
 Ride on.

 Sing as you raise your bow,
 Shoot straighter than before.
 No comfort has the fire at night
 That lights the face so cold.

 Oh dance in the dark of night,
 Sing to the mornin' light.
 The magic runes are writ in gold
 To bring the balance back.
 Bring it back.

 At last the sun is shining,
 The clouds of blue roll by,
 With flames from the dragon of darkness
 The sunlight blinds his eyes.

 There's a lady who's sure
 All that glitters is gold
 And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
 When she gets there she knows
 If the stores are all closed
 With a word she can get what she came for.
 Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

 There's a sign on the wall
 But she wants to be sure
 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
 In a tree by the brook
 There's a songbird who sings,
 Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
 Ooh, it makes me wonder,
 Ooh, it makes me wonder.

 There's a feeling I get
 When I look to the west,
 And my spirit is crying for leaving.
 In my thoughts I have seen
 Rings of smoke through the trees,
 And the voices of those who standing looking.
 Ooh, it makes me wonder,
 Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

 And it's whispered that soon
 If we all call the tune
 Then the piper will lead us to reason.
 And a new day will dawn
 For those who stand long
 And the forests will echo with laughter.

 If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
 Don't be alarmed now,
 It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
 Yes, there are two paths you can go by
 But in the long run
 There's still time to change the road you're on.
 And it makes me wonder.

 Your head is humming and it won't go
 In case you don't know,
 The piper's calling you to join him,
 Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
 And did you know
 Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

 And as we wind on down the road
 Our shadows taller than our soul.
 There walks a lady we all know
 Who shines white light and wants to show
 How ev'rything still turns to gold.
 And if you listen very hard
 The tune will come to you at last.
 When all are one and one is all
 To be a rock and not to roll.

 And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

 Spent my days with a woman unkind,
 Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
 Made up my mind to make a new start,
 Going To California with an aching in my heart.

 Someone told me there's a girl out there
 With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
 Took my chances on a big jet plane,
 Never let them tell you that they're all the same.

 The sea was red and the sky was grey,
 Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
 The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
 As the children of the sun began to awake.

 Seems that the wrath of the Gods
 Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
 I think I might be sinking.
 Throw me a line if I reach it in time
 I'll meet you up there where the path
 Runs straight and high.

 To find a queen without a king;
 They say she plays guitar and cries and sings.
 La la la la
 Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
 Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
 Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
 Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.

 It is the summer of my smiles-
 flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.
 Speak to me only with your eyes
 it is to you I give this tune.
 Ain't so hard to recognise-
 these things are clear to all from
 time to time.  Ooooh...

 Talk Talk -
 I've felt the coldness of my winter
 I never thought it would ever go
 I cursed the gloom that set upon us...

 But I know that I love you so
 but I know that I love you so.

 These are the seasons of emotion
 And like the winds they rise and fall
 This is the wonder of devotion-
 I see the torch we all must hold.

 Upon us all a little rain must fall.

 Let me be yours ever truly
 Can I make your garden grow

 From the houses of the holy
 We can watch the white doves go
 From the door comes Satan's daughter
 And it only goes to show
 Ah, you know

 There's an angel on my shoulder
 In my hand a sword of gold
 Let me wander in your garden
 And the seeds of love I'll sow
 You know-whoa-oh

 So the world is spinning faster
 Are you dizzy when you're stoned
 Let the music be your master
 Will you heed the master's call
 Oh-whoa-oh, Satan an' man

 Said there ain't no use in cryin'
 'Cause it will only, only drive you mad
 Does it hurt to hear them lyin'
 Was this the only world you had
 Oh-oh

 So let me take you, take you to the movie
 Can I take you, baby, to the show
 Why don't you let me be yours ever truly
 Can I make your garden grow

 And stars to fill my dream
 I am a traveler of both time and space
 To be where I have been
 T' sit with elders of the gentle race

 Th' talk of days for which they sit and wait
 All will be revealed

 Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
 Whose sounds caress my ear

 When movin' through Kashmir

 An' though the course may change sometimes
 Rivers always reach the sea

 Blind stars of fortune
 Each have several rays
 On the wings maybe
 Down in birds of prey
 Kind of makes me feel sometimes
 Didn't have to grow
 But as the eagle leaves the nest
 It got so far to go

 Changes fill my time
 Baby, that's alright with me
 In the midst I think of you
 And how it used to be

 Did you ever really need somebody
 And really need 'em bad
 Did you ever really want somebody
 The best love you ever had
 Do you ever remember me, baby
 Did it feel so good
 'Cause it was just the first time
 And you knew you would

 Through the eyes an' I sparkle
 Senses growing keen
 Taste your love along the way
 See your feathers preen
 Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes
 Didn't have to grow
 We are eagles of one nest
 The nest is in our soul

 Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
 Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be

 So know somehow they'll know I never
 Finished payin' for my ride

 Tell me I'm the type of man
 To fight the fight that I'll require

 When the train stops, all together we will smile

 when they told us we should go
 As I turn to you
 you smiled at me
 how could we say no

 With all the fun to have
 to live the dreams we always had
 woa the songs to sing
 when we at last return again

 sending off a glancing kiss
 to those who claim they know
 to know the streets the seaman hears
 the devil is in his hole

 Oh to sail away
 to sandy lands and other days
 oh to touch the dream
 hides inside and never seen, yeah

 Into the sun the south the north
 lies the first of hope
 the shackles of commitment fell
 in pieces on the ground

 Oh to ride the wind
 to tread the air above the din
 oh to laugh aloud
 dancing eyes above the crowd

 To seek the man whose pointing hand
 the giant step unfolds
 With guidance from the curving path
 that churns up into stone

 If one bell should ring
 in celebration for a king
 so fast the heart should beat
 as proud the head with heavy feet, yeah

 (Cool Guitar Solo)

 Days went by when you and I
 made an eternal summers glow
 as far away and distant
 a mutual time to grow

 Oh the sweet refrain
 soothes the soul and calms the pain
 Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again

 Wandering upon the rings
 what place to rest the search
 the mighty arms of Atlas
 hold the heavens from the earth

 the mighty arms of Atlas
 hold the heavens from the earth
 from the eeeeaaaarrrrth

 You better take care how you use it
 Try to make it last all night
 And if you take your pick
 Be careful how you choose it
 Sometimes its hard to feel it bite
 Feel it bite

 A man I know, went down to Louisiana
 Had himself a bad, bad fight
 And when the sun peeks through
 John Cameron he sees (sandy???)
 He kissed the whiskers and left and right
 Whiskers!

 Now, now, now
 A fight subsides
 Out at a hotel in the quarter
 A friendship took a bash tonight
 Now love gets hot
 Look far for a sea with water
 Grew whiskers sittin' there through the night

 Whiskers!

 Down on Bourbon street
 You know it's right
 You can see my friend 
 When they run around us in the night
 Most everywhere
 Until the closet's bare
 Run for the razor, fun
 Doin' up my hair

 New Orleans queens
 Sure know how to schmooz it
 Maybe for some that seems alright
 When I step out
 I'm struck down with my sugar
 She wears my cloak like fairy white
 Now, one town love
 Take care how you use it
 And try to make it last all night
 Take your pick
 Be careful how you choose it

 I was burned in the heat of the moment,
 oh! it could've been the heat of the day
 When I learned how my time had been wasted,
 Dear fellows I turned away
 Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder,
 When I should happen to fall
 Time and his bride growing older
 I've got friends who will give me fuck all

 La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
 La, la, la, la, la, na, na, baby
 La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
 La, la, la, la, la, la

 Corner of Bleeker and nowhere
 In the land of not quite day
 A shiver runs down my backbone
 Face in the mirror turns grey
 So, I looked 'round for a hitch from a reindeer
 Said you oughtta find him out in the day
 I turned 'round to look for the snowman
 To my surprise he'd melted away, yeah

 La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
 La, la, la, la, la, na, na, baby
 La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
 La, la, la, la, la, la

 The moon and the stars out of order
 As the tide tends to ebb and sway
 The sun in my soul's sinking lower
 While the hope in my hands turns to clay
 I don't ask that my feet fall on clover
 I don't roam at opportunity's door
 Why don't you ask my advice, take it slower
 Then your story'd be your finest reward

 La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
 La, la, la, la, la, na, na, baby
 La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah

 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh

 Oh, oh, oh

 (guitar solo)

 Lost on the path to attainment
 Search in the eyes of the wise
 When I bled from the heart of the matter
 I started bleeding without a disguise
 Now everything's finally happened
 Now and then you've got to take time to pause
 When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around
 Or you'll land in a boat without oars

 La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
 La, la, la, la, la, na, na, baby
 La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah
 La, la, la, la, la, la

 Hey babe, Hey babe, Hey babe,

 Hey babe, Hey babe,
 I really, really did now.

 Hey babe, Hey babe,
 I don't know where I'm gonna find it.

 Hey babe, Hey babe,
 Do you wanna know,
 Do you really, really, wanna help me, yeah?

 Let me tell you now, babe
 Let me tell you
 That is fells so good that it must be right

 Now my babe,
 Let me tell you

 I recall you used to say
 oh baby this one's for we too
 Which in the end is you anyway

 how come twenty four hours

 a minute seems like a lifetime
 oh baby when I feel this way

 there was a time that I stood tall
 in the eyes of other men
 But by my own choice I left you woman
 and now I can't get back again

 When the day is done
 I'm looking for my woman
 Oh, but the girl don't come
 So don't let her
 Play you for a fool
 She don't show no pity baby
 No no, she don't make no rules

 Oh, oh, I need your love,
 I need your love
 Oh, I need your love
 I just got to have / I've got pain

 So don't you let her
 Oh, get under your skin
 It's only bad luck and trouble
 From the day that you begin
 I hear you crying in the darkness
 Don't ask nobody's help
 Ain't no pockets dull of mercy baby 
 Cause you can only blame yourself
 
 Oh it's simple
 All the pain that you go through
 You can turn away from fortune, fortune
 Cause that's all that's left to you
 It's lonely at the bottom
 Man, it's dizzy at the top
 But if you're standing in the middle
 Ain't no way you're gonna stop

 Oh whatever what your days may bring
 No use hiding in a corner
 Cause that won't change a thing
 If you're dancing in the doldrums
 One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
 When you're the master of the off-chance
 Well, you don't expect alot

 Both my feet are back on the ground

 And when the rythm takes me
 It feels so good, oh so good

 It will do you good, oh so much good

 With a little bit of stop-a-shakin' shakin'
 And a little bit of fly right down
 And a little bit of sweet con carne
 It makes me feel, makes me feel

 Oh, baby

 Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining
 Like a star that can't wait for the night
 I hate to think I've been blinded baby
 Why can't I see you tonight?

 And the warmth of your smile starts a burning
 And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
 And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
 Why can't you show up, make it all right?
 Yeah. It's all right.

 And if you promised you'd love so completely
 and you said you would always be true
 You swore that you would never leave me baby
 What ever happened to you?

 And you thought it was only ....
 As you wish all your dreams would come true--Hey
 It ain't the first time believe me baby
 I'm standin here feeling blue
 Yeah I'm blue

 Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
 I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
 Another ten minutes no longer
 And then I'm turning around

 The clock on the wall's moving slower
 My heart it sinks to the ground
 And the storm that I thought would blow over
 Clouds the light of the love that I found

 Now my body is starting to quiver
 And the palms of my hands getting wet
 I've got no reason to doubt you baby
 It's all a terrible mess

 I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
 When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop
 The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless
 I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block
 Light of the love that I found

 Well I just got into town today 
 To find my girl who's gone away
 She took the Greyhound at the General Store
 I searched myself I searched the town
 When I finaly did sat down
 I find myself no wiser than before

 She said we couldn't do no wrong
 No other love could be so strong
 She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
 Now she took my heart she took my keys
 From in my old blue dungarees
 And I'll never go to Texas anymore

 Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
 She took my love and walked right out the door
 And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
 I'm gonna give her something like she never had before

 I took her love at seventen
 A little late these days it seems
 But they said heaven's well worth waiting for
 I took her word I took it all
 Beneath the sign that said U-haul
 She left angels hanging round for more 

 I thought I had it all sewn up
 Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck
 But folks said she was after something more
 I never did quite understand
 All that talk about rockin' bands
 But they just rolled my doll right out the door

 Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace,
 Await their place within the ring of calm;
 Still stand to turn in seconds of release,
 Await the call they know may never come.
 In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon
 To jeopardize the course, upset the run;
 And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun
 As love in the halls of plenty overrun.

 Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast,
 Unending dances shadowed on the day.
 Within their walls, their daunting formless keep,
 Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay.
 Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep,
 Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray;
 And ev'rything is soon no sooner thought than deed,
 But no one seemed to question anyway.

 How keen the hunter's eye prevails upon the land
 To seek the unsuspecting and the weak;
 And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand
 Toward the foe that threatened from the deep.
 Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
 Adrift upon a sea of futile speech?
 ...
 ... reach

 Singin' ...

 Where was your word, where did you go?
 Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow.

 Dull is the armour, cold is the day.
 Hard was the journey, dark was the way. Way.

 I heard the word; I couldn't stay. Oh.
 I couldn't stand it another day, another day-ay,
 another day, another day.

 Touched by the timely coming, 
 Roused from the keeper's sleep,
 Release the grip, throw down the key.

 Held now within the knowing,
 Rest now within the peace.
 Take of the fruit, but guard the seed.

 Held now within the knowing,
 Rest now within the beat.
 Take of the fruit, but guard the seed...

 Should I fall out of love, my fire in the night
 To chase a feather in the wind
 Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
 There moves a thread that has no end.

 For many hours and days that pass ever soon
 the tides have caused the flame to dim
 At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
 Is this to end or just begin?

 All of my love, all of my love, oh,
 All of my love to you, now.
 All of my love, all of my love,
 All of my love to you, now.

 The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
 one voice is clear above the din
 Proud Aryan one word, my will to sustain
 For me, the cloth once more to spin 

 Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
 his is the force that lies within
 Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
 He is a feather in the wind

 Here's a tale of Tom
 Who worked the rivers run
 His wife would cook his meat
 But he wouldn't care to eat

 Poor Tom, Seventh Son, Always knew what's goin on

 Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
 There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

 Worked for thirty years
 Sharin' hopes and fears
 Dreamin' of the day
 He could turn and say

 Poor Tom, work's gone, lazin' out in the noonday sun

 Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
 Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

 His wife was Ellie May
 One of many games she played
 When Tom was out of town
 She couldn't keep her dress down

 Poor Tom, Seventh Son, always knew what's goin on

 Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
 Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

 And so it was one day
 That Tom caught Ellie May

 Tom took a gun in his hand
 And stopped all the runnin' around

 Poor Tom, Seventh Son, gotta die for what you've done

 All those years of work are thrown away
 To ease your mind is that all you can say?

 But what about that grandson on your knee?
 And railroad song is ... he could be

 Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
 Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
 Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
 There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

 A few days ago, there was some discussion about Led Zeppelin's borrowings
 from the blues. Travelling Riverside Blues was mentioned as having
 completely different music and, with the exception of the title and
 part of one verse, being nothing like the Robert Johnson version.
 After reading that message I was inspired to transcribe the lyrics
 to TRB, so here are the lyrics to TRB with the original sources, where
 I could find them. They are footnoted with different symbols that are
 explained at the end. I apologize if the lines are divided incorrectly.
 It  was sort of difficult to tell where one ended and another began.
  
 * Asked sweet mama 
 * Let me be her kid
 * She said, "You might get hurt
 * If you don't keep it hid"

   Well I know my baby
   If I see her in the dark
   I said I know my rider
   If I see her in the dark

 # Now, I goin' to Rosedale
 # Take my rider by my side
 # Still barrelhouse
 # If it's on the riverside, yeah
   I know my baby
   Lord, I said, is really sloppy drunk
   I know my mama

 I wanna tell you 'bout the girl I love, my, she looks so fine.
 Ah she's the only one that I been dreaming of,
 maybe someday she will be all mine.
 I wanna tell her that I love her so,
 I thrill with her every touch,
 I need to tell her she's the only one I really love.

 I've got a woman, wanna ball all day,
 I've got a woman, she won't be true no,
 I've got a woman, stay drunk all the time,
 I said I've got a little woman and she won't be true.

 On Sunday morning when we go down the church,
 see the men folk standing in line.
 They say they've come to pray to the Lord,
 but when my little girl looks so fine.
 And in the evening when the sun is sinking low,
 and everybody's with the one they love,
 I walk the town, keep searchin' all around
 lookin' for my street corner girl.

 I've got a woman, wanna ball all day,
 I've got a woman, she won't be true no, no.
 I've got a woman, stay drunk all the time,
 I said I've got a little woman and she won't be true.

 And in the bars where the men play guitars and a drinkin'
 and rememberin' the time,
 my little lover does a midnight shift, she fool around all the time.
 Guess there's just one thing left for me to do,
 gonna pack my bags and move on my way,
 because I got a worried mind sharing what I thought was mine,
 gonna leave her where the guitars play.

 I gotta woman, she won't be true, no, no.
 I gotta woman, wanna ball all day, yeah, yeah, now, now.
 I gotta woman, stay drunk all the time,
 I said I gotta little woman and she won't be true.
 I said she won't be true, no.
 Yea, no, yea, no, yea, no, yea, no
 Keep on keep on keep on keep on keep on keep on keep on (adlib)

 Hey hey what can I do? I got a woman she won't be true.
 Whoa whoa whoa hear what I say

@node "ROBERT PLANT"

@{b} ROBERT PLANT@{ub}

 Born: August 20, 1948 
 Birthname: Robert Plant
 Birthplace: West Bromwich, England in the county of West Midlands

 Robert Plant was Led Zeppelin's powerful vocalist. He had beseeching
 vocals that you swore could brake glass. He brought in a different
 style of vocals. He taught him self how to sing when he was young
 and has been singing ever since. His vocals could be easily compared
 to controlled screaming, but the power from his lungs and great
 control made him a Led Zeppelin trademark. He added to the awsomeness
 of Led Zeppelin and he contributed a great thing to Led Zeppelin by
 his vocals. He also contributed the drummer, John Bonham. john was
 actually introduced to Page by Plant.

@endnode


@node "JIMMY PAGE"

@{b} JIMMY PAGE@{ub}

 Born: January 9, 1944
 Birthname: James Patrick Page
 Birthplace: Heston, England in the county of Middlesex

 Jimmy Page served as Zep's astounding lead guitarist. It's no wonder
 that today there is a guitar named after him. He is one of rock's most
 important and influential guitar players, writers, and producers to
 date. He used his guitars in ways that were unheard of 25 years ago.
 He had a reason for every bit of distortion, feedback, and reverb.
 He had a love and a passion for music that most people didn't have
 or couldn't attain. He also had a special understanding for the guitar
 and electric components that led him to do amazing things in the studio
 that made Led Zeppelin famous. His playing style was taken heavily from
 the blues and he thought of rock as sculptured noise. Major inspirations
 included blues greats such as Howlin' Wolf, Albert King, and Willie Dixon.
 Jimmy Page is an inspiration for many people to learn the guitar and this
 is how many people learned how to play.

@endnode


@node "JOHN PAUL JONES"

@{b} JOHN PAUL JONES@{ub}

 Born: January 3, 1946
 Birthname: John Baldwin
 Birth place: Sidcup, England

 John Paul Jones served as the second half of the amazing rhythm section
 of Led Zeppelin. His amazing bass lines added a touch to the music that
 made Led Zeppelin what it was and forever will be. He helped secure Led
 Zeppelin's spot in rock history. In songs like "Ramble On" he played the
 bass part, which served as the melody. He is said to have been the
 "George Harrison" of Led Zeppelin. He, like George, was the quiet one
 in the group. He always seemed out of the spot light, but he could hold
 his own very well. Plant and page are the ones who really stick out in
 peoples' minds when the name "Led Zeppelin" is heard. Jones was a
 significant part of the quartet, but not a very highly recognized one.
 In my mind, and being a bass player, he is definately an inspiration
 worthy of noting.

@node "JOHN BONHAM"

@{b} JOHN BONHAM@{ub}

 Born: May 31, 1948
 Birth name: John Henry Bonham 
 Nickname: Bonzo
 Place of Birth: Redditch, England

 Bonzo made up half of the amazing rhythm section of the quartet.
 In songs like "Moby Dick", he got to show just how good he was.
 Legend has it that John broke more drum heads in a week than most
 people break in their lifetime. He may have been one of the greatest
 rock drummers of all time. It's no wonder that he was such a loss to
 the world when he died. He had a unique sence of percussion that most
 people don't have. It was truely a gift and a great asset to make Led
 Zeppelin what it has become. He was a great person who had a unique
 gift besides his drumming abilities, he was also a great human being.
 He was fun loving and a great person to know.

@endnode


@node "4"

4 - When and where was Led Zeppelin formed?

A brief chronology:

Jimmy Page joins The Yardbirds in June of 1966, first playing bass, then
dual lead guitar with Jeff Beck, then replacing Beck in November of the
same year.  In December, John Paul Jones does string arrangements for The
Yardbirds' album _Little Games_.

In 1967, Robert Plant and John Bonham come together in The Band Of Joy.
In March of the same year, Jeff Beck releases a solo single entitled
"Hi Ho Silver Lining," which is backed with a Page composition entitled
"Beck's Bolero".  This song is recorded by Page, Beck, Nicky Hopkins,
John Paul Jones, and Keith Moon.  At this session Moon and John Entwistle,
who are tired of The Who, discuss forming a band with Page and Beck.
It is here that Moon announces that they should call the group Lead Zeppelin,
because, "...it'll go over like a fuckin' lead balloon!"  The "a" was later
removed from "Lead" so that Americans would pronounce it correctly.

In April of 1968, Page, Jones, and Bonham play on Donovan's "Hurdy
Gurdy Man," and Jones asks to be part of any new group Page is considering
forming.  The Band Of Joy breaks up in May.  On 22 June 1968, it is
announced that Keith Relf and Jim McCarty are leaving The Yardbirds.
In August, Page, Yardbirds' bassist Chris Dreja, and Peter Grant travel
to Birmingham to see Plant in a group called Hobbstweedle.  Plant is
offered the vocalist job in Page's new band in August after visiting Page's
home.  In the same month, Dreja drops out and is replaced by Jones.  Plant
then recommends Bonham for drums, and a tireless campaign convinces Bonham
to turn down more lucrative offers from the likes of Tim Rose and Joe
Cocker.  In September, the 4 play their first rehearsals at Gerrard Street,
London.  Beginning September 14, they play their first tour, still billed
as the New Yardbirds.  They record _Led Zeppelin I_ in October, and play
their first gig as Led Zeppelin at Surrey University October 17.

5 - How and when did John Bonham die?

On 24 September 1980, Bonham left Worcestershire to meet with the group at
Bray studios for rehearsals for the upcoming US tour.  He drank quadruple
screwdrivers steadily along the way.  After the rehearsals, the band retreated
to Page's Windsor house, where Bonham continued to drink and then passed
out.  At around 1:45pm on 25 September, sound technician and Plant roadie
Benji Le Fevre checked on Bonham to find out why he hadn't stirred.  There
was no pulse.  A doctor arrived and pronouced Bonham dead at the scene.
A subsequent coroner's inquest revealed the cause of death to be accidental--
Bonaham choked on his own vomit after drinking the equivilent of 40 measures
of vodka.  Alcohol poisoning may have been involved, but was not positively
determined.  On December 4th, 1980, Led Zeppelin issued the following
statement:

We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend and the deep respect
we have for his family, together with the sense of undivided harmony felt
by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not
continue as we were.

in-studio "Travelling Riverside Blues," and a Page amalgamation of "Moby
Dick" and "Bonzo's Montreaux".  The non-US version, later released in the
States, is entitled _Remasters_, is a 2CD set, and contains one song not
on the 4CD set ("Good Times Bad Times").  All tracks are remastered from
the lowest generation tapes available to Page and George Marino.

@endnode


@node "7"

7 - Should I buy the boxed set?  How about _Remasters_?

The sound quality of both is incredibly improved over the US CD releases.
For that reason alone either is worth getting, at least until such time
as Atlantic reissues the 10 original CD's with the Page-remastered versions
of the songs.  As for the "unreleased" material--"HHWCID" is available
on the "Immigrant Song" single, "Traveling Riverside Blues" is a staple
of AOR radio, and there are many versions of "White Summer" superior to
the one released on the set.  The packaging is outstanding.  From there,
you'll have to make up your own mind.

_Remasters_, the short version of the set, differs only in the number of
songs offered and the presence of "Good Times Bad Times," which is not
on the 4CD set.  Its value to those who already own the 4CD set is principally
that of a collector's item.  But it is a viable (and cheaper) alternative to
the larger set.  Again, make up your own mind.

With the release of the remaining Zeppelin tracks on a second boxed set,
from a quality standpoint the boxed sets become almost a necessity.

@endnode


@node "8"

8 - So what is the fourth album called, anyway?

Nothing.  It's officially untitled.  It's commonly referred to as Four
Symbols, ZOSO, and most often simply Led Zeppelin IV.  The album, as
originally released, carried absolutely no band or title identification
anywhere on the jacket.

@endnode


@node "9"

9 - What's the deal with those symbols?

Page's symbol, while _not_ standing for "ZOSO" or any combination of
letters, is a mystery.  Plant reports being told exactly once what it
means, but he has since forgotten.  Jones' symbol came from a book of runes
and is said to represent confidence and competence.  Bonham's came from the
same book, and represents the man-wife-child trilogy.  It has also been
remarked that it is the symbol for Ballantine Beer.  Plant, like Page,
designed his own symbol, and the feather in the circle is based on a sign
of the ancient Mu civilization.

@endnode


@node "10"

10 - What's that thing on the _Presence_ cover?

It's called The Obelisk, and was designed by Hipgnosis (the design company)
to represent Led Zeppelin's "force and presence."  It is not supposed to
refer to the Monolith of 2001.

@endnode


@node "11"

11 - What's up with the album covers for _In Through The Out Door_?

There are 6 different covers, each showing the same scene from a different
point of view.  The album originally came in a plain brown wrapper.
An added bonus--the inner sleeve, when dampened, changes color.

@endnode


@node "12"

12 - What's Zeppelin's best song/album?

This is a purely subjective opinion--there's no right answer.

Albums--_IV_ has sold the most copies, though it never hit #1 (it was behind
Carole King's _Tapestry_).  Critics and fans usually pick either _IV_ or
_Physical Graffiti_ as the best, though the most often cited by musicians
as being influential is _II_.  Plant's fave is _PG_.

Songs--"Stairway To Heaven" is the most-requested and most-played rock song
of all time.  It was never released as a single, so comparisons to "End Of
The Road" are not applicable.  The band seems to feel that "Kashmir" captures
the essence of the band better than any other song, though Page and Jones
profess abiding love for "STH," and Page is proud of "Achilles Last Stand."
Plant loathes "Stairway."

@endnode


@node "13"

13 - What's up with (song title) (and who's Roy Harper)?

A few notes about individual songs:

"Dazed And Confused"--The Yardbirds performed this with different lyrics
                      as "I'm Confused".

"Black Mountain Side"--Viram Jasnai plays tabla.

"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper"--Roy Harper is an English folk musician who
                            toured (not in the performance sense) with
                            Zeppelin and with whom Page and other Zeppelin
                            members have often worked.

"Bron-Yr-Aur"--A cabin where Zeppelin often retreated for composition and
              relaxation.  It means "The Golden Breast".

"Black Dog"--The title came from a black dog that wandered in and out of
             the studio during the _IV_ sessions.

"The Battle Of Evermore"--Sandy Denny (of Fairport Convention) on vocals.
                          Her parts were handled live by John Paul Jones.

"D'yer Mak'er"--pronounced like Jamaica.

"Boogie With Stu"--Stu is Ian Stewart, the Stones resident pianist.

@endnode


@node "14

14 - Are there a lot of references to J.R.R. Tolkien's works in Zeppelin songs?

Not really.  "Ramble On" and "The Battle Of Evermore" feature direct
references, as does the title "Misty Mountain Hop," but that's it.

@endnode


@node "15"

15 - Didn't Zeppelin copy (song title) from (blues artists)?

Yes, no, and maybe.  Here's a partial list of covers, credited and
otherwise:

"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"--Anne Bredon (the Joan Baez version was the
                            one this was based on)

"You Shook Me," "I Can't Quit You Baby," and "Whole Lotta Love"--Willie Dixon

"Dazed And Confused"--Jake Holmes, lyrics changed

"Black Mountain Side"--traditional, Bert Jansch, John Renbourn

"The Lemon Song"--Chester Burnett, Albert King, Robert Johnson ("squeeze my
                  lemon" lyric)

"Traveling Riverside Blues"--Robert Johnson (lyrics only, the music is
                             totally different)

"Since I've Been Loving You"--brief lyrical nod to Moby Grape

"Gallows Pole"--traditional, often played by Leadbelly

"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper"--traditional, Bukka White (song entitled "Shake
                            'Em On Down")

"Black Dog"--vocal arrangement loosely based on Fleetwood Mac's "Oh Well"

"Rock And Roll"--drawn from Little Richard's "Good Golly Miss Molly/Keep A
                 Knockin'" (mostly the drum line)

"When The Levee Breaks"--Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy

"Custard Pie"--some Bukka White material

"In My Time Of Dying"--traditional, Bob Dylan's version was adapted

"Boogie With Stu"--Richie Valens

"Nobody's Fault But Mine"--Blind Willie Johnson (lyrics)

"We're Gonna Groove"--B.B. King, J. Bethea

So is this thievery?  With the exception of the uncredited Willie Dixon
tunes and the lifting by the Yardbirds of Jake Holmes' "D&C," anyone
who understands the blues tradition knows that theft is an irrelevant
concept within that musical genre.  Besides, as was the case with "Traveling
Riverside Blues," often the Zeppelin version bore little if any resemblance
to the original.

16 - Where's all the unreleased stuff?

There are very few unreleased _studio_ Zeppelin songs, as most of the
extras have appeared on _PG_ and _Coda_.  There are quite a few jams
and alternate takes to be had, however.  As far as professionally-
recorded live audio and video, most of this still resides in Page's
vaults, though most of the soundboard bootlegs of the past few years
are taken from tapes stolen from his house.

The long-rumoured Page-produced live recording is unlikely to appear,
nor is any further work on the soundtrack to _TSRTS_ forthcoming.
George Marino of Sterling Sound is quoted about Page's attitude toward
releasing live material - "Even if they were guaranteed to sell a million
of a live thing, I don't think he'd put it out if he didn't feel that the
playing was good enough."

17 - How does the band feel about bootlegs?

First of all, a few definitions - "bootlegs" are, in this case, defined as
live concert recordings, studio outtakes, radio broadcasts, and similar
material neither released nor sanctioned by the band or its management.
They are not to be confused with counterfeit copies of legitimate releases,
which are uniformly denounced and actively prosecuted by the law.

In the past, Peter Grant used to make surprise stops in record stores to
destroy any Zeppelin bootlegs he found.  He also confiscated or destroyed
any microphones and recording equipment he found at concerts.  Since then,
however, the band has mellowed considerably on the subject.

Jimmy Page: "_Coda_ was released, basically, because there was so much
bootleg stuff out.  We thought, 'Well, if there's that much interest,
then we may as well put the rest of our studio stuff out.'"  The much-
discussed chronological live album has not been put out by Page, becuase,
"there are so many bootlegs around that people who are interested have
probably made up their own compilation."  He also has said, on the
possibility of more studio outtakes being released:  "Ah, no.  There's
some great live stuff.  But there's also some great live bootlegs, ha
ha. Thank God they're there and thanks to the people who send me these
things.  I listen to them and go, 'My God, that was good.  I wish it
had been recorded on the line.'"

Robert Plant has often been known to autograph bootlegs, and all three
members have from time to time requested copies of some of the better
known productions.  And a Page fan reports meeting Page and giving him
a copy of a 10-album Zeppelin bootleg set.  Page said, "Thanks," and
continued walking on, as rock stars usually do when fans hand them
something.  But when he saw that the gift was a bootleg, Page stopped,
went back to the fan, and said, "Thanks!  This is great!"

Page's opinion of boots has soured somewhat since the release of _Outrider_,
however, as his house was broken into during the early recording stages.
Among the items stolen were the demo tapes for what was to be a 2-album
release (rather than the 1 that came out as _Outrider_), numerous studio
outtakes and live soundboard recordings which have since flooded the market,
and the pro-shot Knebworth video from 8-11-79.

18 - So where do I get bootlegs?

This is a difficult subject for the list, as we are dealing with an
illegality (though a not-very-well-enforced one).  Specific info on
bootlegs and traders will not appear in this FAQL, nor should the
actual transfer of material appear in the list itself.  Caution should
be excercized for the protection of both the list and the traders
themsleves.  Having supplied the necessary disclaimers...

Small (non-chain) record stores that advertise "New-Old-Used" records
almost always carry bootleg albums and CDs, as well as some out-of-print
stuff.  _Goldmine_ and _Record Collector_ magazine can be scanned for
sources.  Tape trading, the most popular form of collecting, is usually
restricted to individuals rather than organizations or companies.  You
should also know that many bootleg collectors/traders frown on the "selling"
of bootlegs, although beginning collectors are often restricted to that
option.

Most often, simply posting to the list and stating your desire to find
unreleased Zeppelin material will start the ball rolling.  Note that the
discussion of bootlegs is in no way illegal.

Oakland, 7-11-79 Knebworth, 7-5-80 Munich

Note that there's duplication and overlap in the above lists.  A few notes
about formats--the quality of CD releases is only occasionally better
than other formats, but the permanence and playback advantages of CDs
have convinced many collectors to concentrate on them.  The CDs are
not always tracked well, though--track markers are often misplaced or
missing altogether.  LPs suffer from quality problems with repeated
playback and scratching, but have the advantage of better packaging.
Tapes are the cheapest option, and suffer the most from successive
generations of copies.  However, they have two significant advantages:
many shows on have never appeared on CD or LP, and complete concerts
are much easier to obtain on this format (CDs and LPs exhibit the so-called
"slice and dice" mentality of bootleggers trying to meet time requirements
and still make money).

21-Are there any books on Zeppelin?

Many.  Few good ones, though.  The key resources are:

Led Zeppelin Complete--(piano) Music from the first 5 albums.

Led Zeppelin--(music) A 2-book companion to the 4CD set, features notation
              and tabulature for all instruments used on the boxed set
              tracks.  The transcription is excellent, though the lyrical
              interpretations leave something to be desired.

Led Zeppelin--Howard Mylett

Led Zeppelin In The Light--Howard Mylett and Richard Bunton

Led Zeppelin In Their Own Words--Paul Kendall

Led Zeppelin A Visual Documentary--Paul Kendall

Led Zeppelin Portraits--Neal Preston--This book is a must-have, as Preston
                        was an "offical" photographer and knew better than
                        anyone how to capture Zeppelin's mystique.

Led Zeppelin The Final Acclaim--Dave Lewis

Led Zeppelin The Book--Chris Welch

The Illustrated Collectors Guide To Led Zeppelin--Robert Godwin--Another
                        must-have, covers the legal and bootleg
                        discographies on vinyl and CD.  3rd edition.

Led Zeppelin A Celebration--Dave Lewis--The principal resource for this
                            FAQL.  Incredible.

Led Zeppelin Heaven And Hell--Charles Cross and Erik Flannigan, with Neal
                            Preston--another key resource for this FAQL.

Jimmy Page:  Tangents Within A Framework--Howard Mylett

and, of course:

Hammer Of The Gods--Stephen Davis--The band denounces it, and it is mostly
                    the rememberings of tour manager/perpetual addict
                    Richard Cole, whose own book is much more valuable
                    for these insights.  Readers should know that Stephen
                    Davis once claimed quite seriously, in an interview
                    for a Zeppelin fanzine, that Jimmy Page had put some
                    sort of curse on him.  Read at your own risk.

23 - Info on lyrics, tabs, GIFs, etc.:

***(NB:  this area is under construction.  Info is not guaranteed, and
         sources remain incomplete and unverified)***

Lyrics--correct lyrics for the Zeppelin catalog are largely unavailable.
The lyric transcription in the boxed set folio is terrible, the lyrics
in _Complete_ are deliberately incorrect in places, and there are no
canonical sources for the rest.  _Presence_, for instance, remains a
particularly hard album to complete lyrics for.  See addresses below.

Tabs--the boxed set folio has excellent tabulature (and standard notation)
for vocals, all guitars, bass, drums and percussion, keyboards, and all other
instruments.  See addresses below.

GIFs--See addresses below.

One good on-line source for info is our own Maurice, who has available
the following information:

-lyrics (long)
-tour & bootleg info (long)
-list of bootlegs with songlists (long)
-singles (a short list)
-list of LZ covers by other artists (medium)
-list of covers Played live by zep (medium)
-info about Page's sessions (long)
-list of anagrams :-)
-list of video boots (short)
-list of books and mags (long)
- A long Jim Zappia file of roots of Zep songs
-lots of other stuff I saved...

FTP sites with Zeppelin info include:

25 - What did the members of Zeppelin do after the band broke up?

Jones recorded the soundtrack for _Scream For Help_, with the assistance
of Page and Yes' Jon Anderson.  He has produced Mission UK and his daughter
(Jacinda Jones), as well as a group he referred to as "industrial flamenco":
La Sura Dels Baus.  He has done string arrangements for Cinderella's
_Heartbreak Station_ and REM's _Automatic For The People_, guested on Peter
Gabriel's _Us_ album on surdu, bass, and keyboards, and appeared in Paul
McCartney's movie and soundtrack for _Give My Regards To Broadstreet_.
He appeared on stage with Plant once in December 1983, during the _Principle
Of Moments_ tour.  He has composed for and performed with the early music
ensemble Red Byrd.  He appeared on and assisted with Ben E. King's reunion
tour and album.  He professes his interests to be in keyboards and dance
music, rather than rock.

Plant has released 5 solo albums--_Pictures At Eleven_, _The Principle
Of Moments_, _Shaken 'N' Stirred_, _Now & Zen_, and _Manic Nirvana_.
In addition, there is a _Little by Little Collector's Edition_ EP.
He was the vocalist for the Honeydrippers' only album, which also featured
Jimmy Page on "Sea Of Love" and "I Get A Thrill."  He has appeared on the
_Porky's_ and _White Nights_ soundtracks, and also an album of Elvis covers.
He contributed vocals for the song "The Only One" on Page's _Outrider_.
And, of course, he did a Diet Coke commercial.  Rumours of a relationship
with Canadian singer Alannah Myles were true.  He is currently not married,
and has 2 children (Carmen and Logan).

Page released the soundtrack to the film _Death Wish 2_.  He has jammed
extensively, with (among others) Jeff Beck, Yes, Foreigner, Bon Jovi,
Aerosmith, Poison, Eric Clapton, Ian Stewart, Roy Harper, Alexis Korner,
Robert Plant, The Beach Boys, Jaco Pastorius, Solid Ground, and even
Harry Connick, Jr.  He appeared on albums by Willie and The Poor Boys,
Stephen Stills, and Box Of Frogs (an ex-Yardbirds reunion).  He teamed up
with Paul Rodgers of Bad Company, Tony Franklin from Roy Harper's band (last
seen with Blue Murder) and Chris Slade of Manfred Mann (now with AC/DC)
to create The Firm, which released 2 albums--_The Firm_ and _Mean Business_.
He participated in the British and American versions of the ARMS tour (to
benefit MS) with Clapton, Beck, Steve Winwood, Bill Wyman, and other
luminaries.  He guested on two tracks from Plant's _Now & Zen_ album,
"Heaven Knows" and "Tall Cool One."  And he released a solo album entitled
_Outrider_ with Jason Bonham on drums.  He is married and has two children.

Bonham, surprisingly enough, made it past the grave as the drum track
to Frankie Goes To Hollywood's hit "Relax," as well as being extensively
sampled for rap beat compilations.

Peter Grant is working on the much-lamented Malcom McLaren movie, details
of which are best gotten from our British friends.

26 - Reunions, reunions, reunions...

First of all--as of this writing, Zeppelin is _not_ getting back together.

A brief history:

XYZ--a project combining elements of Yes and Zeppelin.  Chris Squire
reports that he has tapes of things that he, Alan White, Page, and
possibly Jones (though no one knows for sure) were involved in.  The
project crashed for lack of a vocalist--namely, Plant--and becuase of
thinly veiled threats from various management interests.  The name, in
case someone hasn't figured it out, stands for "eX-Yes-and-Zeppelin".

Live Aid--On 13 July 1985, the 3 living members of Zeppelin, along with
Paul Martinez (from Plant's band) on bass, Tony Thompson (of Chic) on drums,
and Phil Collins (who had to fly over after his performance at Wembley)
on drums, appeared at the Live Aid festival at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia.
They performed "Rock And Roll," "Whole Lotta Love," and "Stairway To Heaven."
Plant was hoarse from 4 consecutive nights of singing and a morning
rehearsal, Page's guitar was out of tune, Collins and Thompson were lost
much of the time, and Bill Graham, who was promoting, was pointing at his
watch all through "STH" because Zeppelin was taking more than their allotted
time.  Ten days later, Page joined Plant on his solo tour for a few encores.

Reunion #1--In January of 1986, Zeppelin and Tony Thompson met in secret
in a village hall near Peter Gabriel's Bath studios.  Plant handled bass
chores while Jones played keyboards.  They worked through "..two or three
things that were quite promising, a sort of cross between David Byrne and
Husker Du."  But it was not to be--Plant was not used to having to deal
with Page's eccentricities any longer (he reportedly changed the batteries
on his wah pedal every other song), and Tony Thompson was injured in a car
accident.  Plant walked out.

Hammersmith Odeon--17 April 1988, Page joins Plant's tour for a blistering
encore featuring "Trampled Underfoot," "Gambler's Blues/I Can't Quit You
Baby/Since I've Been Loving You," and "Rock And Roll."

Atlantic 40th--14 May 1988--A 12-hour tribute concert for Atlantic Records,
which came to a climax with Zeppelin's performance featuring Jason Bonham
on drums.  Jason played well, but the night is generally considered a
disaster.  The rehearsal was reportedly brilliant.  The evening arrived with
the band better rehearsed than they had been at Live Aid.  But the concert
ran late, upsetting Page's always fragile nerves, which caused him to drink
even more heavily than usual.  Plant was refusing to sing "STH" up until they
actually went on stage.  The sound men for the TV broadcast completely lost
the keyboard sound for "Kashmir."  Plant was bumped by a fan during the same
song, and forgot the lyrics to one verse and to "STH" later on.  Page's
solos were mostly a disaster.  The set list was:  "Kashmir," "Heartbreaker/
Whole Lotta Love" (the Knebworth '79 arrangement), "Misty Mountain Hop," and
"Stairway To Heaven."

Carmen Plant--The band played at Carmen Plant's 21st birthday party, with
Jason once again on drums.  Set list was "Trampled Underfoot," "Misty
Mountain Hop," and "Rock And Roll."  November 1989.

Jason's Wedding--The band also reformed for Jason Bonham's wedding, playing
"Bring It On Home, "Rock And Roll," "Sick Again," "Custard Pie," and Jerry
Lee Lewis' "It'll Be Me."  Both this and the previous performance were said
to be outstanding.  28 April 1990.

Knebworth '90--Page joined Plant's band (despite rumours and even the official
set list announcing Led Zeppelin's presence, Jones was nowhere to be found)
for "Misty Mountain Hop," the first-ever Page-led performance of "Wearing
And Tearing," and "Rock And Roll."  Page had stood on the sidelines earlier
as Plant's band ran down "Immigrant Song" and "Going To California."

Reunion #2--The following January, the members of Zeppelin met with Peter
Grant to discuss a reunion tour.  Lighting and sound companies were contacted,
stadiums were quietly reserved.  After badgering Plant in public and private
about the reunion, Page thought he had finally convinced him to go along
with it.  Both Page and Jones had expressed varying degrees of enthusiasm
for the idea.  But Plant, after agreeing to the tour and breaking for lunch,
came back one hour later and said no.  This angered Page immensely, and
given Plant's continuing bad-mouthing of Zeppelin in the press, he set out
to show up Plant.  Which leads to...

27 - What's with this Page/Coverdale project?

The project, currently entitiled simply _Coverdale/Page_ and slated for a
March 16th release, features Page, David Coverdale of Whitesnake, Ricky
Phillips of Bad English on bass, and Danny Carmassi of Heart/Montrose on
drums.  It is rumoured to be an outstanding album by those, including Jason
Bonham, who have heard it, with complex times and rhythms, and a rejuvenated
Jimmy Page.

The following was culled from literature at an album listening party:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Side A                             Side B
Shake my tree (4:50)               Easy does it (5:51)

Over now (5:22)                    Whisper a prayer for the dying (6:54)
Feelin hot (4:10)

"It begins February 9 with 'Pride and Joy.'"
"Album in stores March 16."
"Never has it been more true that the music speaks for itself."

29 - What's this I hear about another Led Zeppelin boxed set?

March 23 is the tentative release date for a second Zeppelin box containing
the songs not on the 4CD set (excluding material from _TSRTS_) and a previously
unreleased track from the _I_ sessions entitled "Baby Come On Home".  Page
and George Marino (who worked on the original set) apparently did the work
on this one while Page was working on his own solo release.  Whether or not
this clears the way for newly-remastered versions of the ten studio albums
is not known, though sources at Atlantic profess no immediate interest in
the project.

The following info is from C.M.:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The title is "Boxed Set^2", the 2 is raised, read boxed set squared or
to the second power.

This is a CD ONLY collection which will retail for $32.98.

It contains a 48-page booklet "featuring numerous photographs, complete
credits, and liner notes by 'Rolling Stone' Music Editor David Fricke."

There is a little picture of what I am assuming is the cover of the set.
There is just the shadow of a zeppelin flying over what looks like an
ocean, but it is hard to tell from the picture.  The zeppelin is, however,
moving out of the frame.
++++++++++++++++++++++++

And from J.L.:

I read in the Sunday Los Angeles Times that the second box set has been 
put on hold. No reason given and no new expected release date.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Info from Kerrang! also indicates a push-back to October for the set,
though this may be a date exclusive to the UK.

As for the unreleased track, Yves Beauvais, who put the last box set together
and is also working on this one, describes it as "a real open blues type of
thing, not a busy Zep-type tune where there's a lot of guitar work... It's
a very good song, a Page/Plant original, on which Plant sings wonderfully."

32 - Who is Dread Zeppelin and how does the band feel about them?

Dread Zeppelin are a group of musicians playing reggae, often using Zeppelin
and/or Elvis songs as the material.  Their albums have contained progressively
less Zeppelin content.  They were, at the outset, extremely satirical in 
nature.

Page hates them.  Plant loves them.  Jones' opinion has not been noted
but is almost assuredly the same as Plant's.

No.  It was suggested to him by a session violinist whose father was the
actor David McCallum, but it had been done before.

@node "34"

34 - What's this "theramin" thing that Page uses?

This is the first device to use alternative means of interaction to
produce...er...music (sort of). It was invented by Leo Theremin, a Russian
living in England, in the 1930's, and was made popular in the 1960's by Sun
Ra. The instrument produces sine-wave sounds by the beat frequencies between
a reference RF oscillator and an oscillator tuned by the change in capacitance
between a antenna and the performer's hands, arms or body caused by movement.
The closer you came to the antenna, the higher the capacitance and higher the
pitch. Later versions of the instrument have volume control from a second
antenna.  Page uses the theramin live during "Whole Lotta Love" and "No
Quarter," and occasionally elsewhere.  It was also prominent in the studio
version of "WLL".

The Theramin is used at the beginning of Beach Boys' song "Good Vibrations".

35 - Is that Jimmy Page I hear on TV?

If you're watching the beginning of "The Wonder Years," the answer is yes.
Again, no attempt will be made to cover the extensive and largely unknown
Zeppelin discography here, but a few significant Zeppelin appearences
include:

_Lucifer Rising_--Page did the incredibly annoying, headache-inducing
                  soundtrack.

_Whatever Happened To Jugula?_--Page and Roy Harper, acoustic.

_Right By You_--Stephen Stills solo album, with Page on 2 tracks.

_Dirty Work_--Rolling Stones, Page on "One Hit (To The Body)".

_Their Satanic Majesties Request_--Rolling Stones--Jones did the string
                                   arrangements for "She's A Rainbow".

"With A Little Help From My Friends"--Joe Cocker's famous cover, Page.

"You Really Got Me," and "All Day And All Of The Night"--The Kinks, though
                        the band denies Page's involvement.

"Gloria," "Baby Please Don't Go," and "Here Comes The Night" by Them, Page
                        on guitar.

"Can't Explain"--The Who, Page on rhythm guitar only.

@node "36"

36 - Is Jimmy Page a Satanist?

Jimmy Page is a collector of occult books and paraphanalia.  He is interested
in religion and spirituality to the point of considering, in an interview,
"...getting a degree in theology."  He was a devotee of Aleister Crowley,
a famous English occultist (and, perhaps, Satanist) to the point of buying
his old residence.  He often quoted Crowley, most notably on the runoff
matrix of _III_.  So is he a Satanist?  He says no, the band says no.  There
is no reason to speculate further.

Rumours persist that the band sold its souls to Satan in exchange for
power, fame, wealth, etc., and that Jones was the only one to refuse.
The various disasters which have befallen the band are often used to support
this theory.  However, there is absolutely no evidence for this, the band
denies it, and in the words of Zeppelin biographer Charles Cross:

"Rereading these comments, while lying in a room that Jimmy Page, the
person--the human being--once occupied, I can't believe the heartlessness,
the meanness, the utter inhumanity of those remarks.  From mud sharks to
pacts with Satan, the public seems to suspend normal human empathy when
talking about Led Zeppelin, accepting preposterous malice of the sort that
would never be accepted if it were directed toward anyone outside of rock
'n' roll.  Have you heard anyone describe a successful business executive
as having sold his soul to Satan?  Wouldn't we laugh this comment off
instantly if applied to anyone else, anyone working in any other art form?
Can one _really_ believe that a pact with Satan is possible, and if so isn't
_that_ the big story here?"

37 - I heard there were backward messages in "Stairway To Heaven".

You're not alone.  This rumour has persisted ever since a California
committee of parents and religious leaders set out to prove that rock
music was leading our children down the path to the devil.  For reasons
still unknown to rational minds, they decided to play some albums backwards,
and professed to hear all sorts of messages in songs like Queen's "Another
One Bites The Dust," anything and everything by Styx and ELO, Rush's "Anthem,"
the Stones' "19th Nervous Breakdown," Skynyrd's "Freebird," The Eagles'
"Hotel California," and most notably the most-requested rock song of all
time, Led Zeppelin's "Stairway To Heaven."  A cynic might wonder why nearly
all the titles named were huge hits, just like many wonder why believers
in reincarnation were always someone famous in a past life.

A definition is useful here--"backmasking" is the process of either:
1) recording a message backwards on a tape meant to be played forwards,
or 2) the "hiding" of messages within forward phrases that, when played
backwards, reveal another phrase.

So does backmasking exist?  Andy Johns, the producer of _IV_, says that
not only is "backmasking" a myth, but that there was no such nonsense
while he was present.  Certainly, since the advent of the "backmasking"
scandal, groups such as ELO and Pink Floyd have used the technique to
poke fun at people who would actually play records backwards.  Most of
the bands named in such accusations tend to ignore the outcry, for as
Jones commented in _Rolling Stone_, there's absolutely no arguing someone
out of something they really want to believe.  But the idea of backmasking
is uniformly considered ludicrous by musicians and producers alike, and
they're the ones that would be responsible for the process.

Despite the denials of the people involved, let's assume that these
messages do exist.  Are they effective?  If they were subliminal messages
played _forward_, then scientists agree that the brain could and would
process the information.  But scientists are also convinced that the
brain cannot decipher backwards information unless it is specifically
engaged for that purpose.  Therefore, even if backmasking _did_ exist,
it would be useless.  Plant:  "If it worked, every record would have the
backward message 'BUY THIS RECORD' in it!"  So much for Satanic intent.

And specifically, as regards "Stairway To Heaven"--there are many messages
that various groups have claimed to hear while playing the song backwards,
but the most uniformly cited is the phrase "Here's to my sweet Satan."
Not all listeners that hear backward phrases are in agreement here, however,
and not even close to all who hear the song backwards hear messages at
all.  Many of those who do hear "something" dismiss it as a mere phonetic
coincidence.  And few of those who do hear the exact message given were
unaware of the accusations against Zeppelin and "STH" before they listened
to the song.  Therefore, overwhelming evidence supports the conclusion that
such messages do not exist, and if they did they would be useless, and
even if they weren't they are almost assuredly accidents aided by the power
of suggestion.  But still, this rumour will not die.  Perhaps it is relevant
to note that the same committee who found "STH" to be Satanic in nature
also claims that the theme song from the "Mr. Ed" TV show is full of
Satanic messages when played backwards.
