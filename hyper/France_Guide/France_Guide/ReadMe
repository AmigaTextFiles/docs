  INSTALLATION
--------------

  Double-click on one of the Install icons (Thanks Gérard !)

  THAT'S ALL!
  
  You'll need about 9 MB of hard disk space for the installation!
  After installation, the current version of France.Guide (and all of 
  its accompanying files), will occupy about 6 MB on your hard disk.

  UTILISATION
-------------

  For optimum viewing, your screen should be set at least to 640 x 512, 
  8 colo(u)rs. 
  
  The maps have been designed for the MagicWB palette [translator note: :-( ]
  
  The specially handcrafted font (Helvetica in 9 points size), supplied with
  France.Guide is ideal for a 17" screen or bigger.

  If you choose to install this font, to be able to use it within France.Guide,
  you'll have to remove the '@REMARK ' in front of '@Font helvetica.font 9',
  at the beginning of France.Guide itself.

  Notes for AmigaOS 2.x users :
-------------------------------

  To be able to display the maps, you'll have to do some search/replace 
  in your favourite text editor, on the lines containing "Cartes", they use 
  a function that is not compatible with AmigaGuide as supplied with WB 2.x:
  
  ie:
  
  Replace:
  @{" CARTE - Alsace  " LINK "Cartes/Cartes_Alsace/Carte_Rég_Alsace.iff/Main"}
  
  By :         
  @{" CARTE - Alsace  " SYSTEM "PPShow Cartes/Cartes_Alsace/Carte_Rég_Alsace.iff"}
