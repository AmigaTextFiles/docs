             This matter is so huge that I'll just start by saying some
             universal facts. First of all it is very hard to find any
             evidence to prove that the given arguments were correct.
             If you were inside the byro you had a slight possibility
             to gather some secret information, but like most of us
             normal people we'll have no chance to obtain them.
             Anyway we all have brains, so why not use them.

             Here is what I think of this.


             1.... The existence of aliens.

             I believe that there are aliens. (Nice one. - Jeff)
             The fact that so many have reported UFO abducts or fly-bys
             is one concrete evidence that the grey men exist.
             One people can lie, not thousands. (Mass lunacy?)
             We are surrounded by billions of stars, which provide the
             same possibilities for life as our sun. It would be pure
             insanity not to agree that. Somewhere in the deep space
             there is one alien lifeform having fun right now.
             The big question is the distance between us and them and
             their current tech-level. They are far away, that is for sure.
             But the possibility that they were on the same tech-stage as us
             is extremely small; They are behind or way ahead us. The
             possibility that they were on the same stage is very small.
             If they have discovered some, unknow to us, ways to travel
             fast, then it is not impossible that they have located their
             base on the dark side of the moon.
             The neat thing to know is that how they located us.

             The other possibility is that we just have not met in the
             space; they have made us. Like one of the texts says that
             the aliens claim that they created human and the religion.
             If they created us that leads to another question...


             2.... The purpose of the alien beholding.

             If the aliens created us, then we are in trouble. They have
             followed us, as creators, and they know the weaknesses of
             the human. One of my other theories is that they also created
             the dinosaurs. But the evolution of the dinosaurs just went
             into the wrong direction and the aliens decided to wipe them
             out. Or perhaps the aliens picked the best monsters to add them
             into their alien games and destroyed the weaks. I also
             note that one of the texts says that the CIA's drug business'
             main goal is to kill the weak parts of our society and
             provide them enough money to keep on testing those alien vessels.
             Then when the time comes the aliens would pick up the strongest
             humans and perhaps kill the rest unwanted beings.

             But why did the aliens do all this?

             They just do not want to look how a life form or a civilization
             developes itself. If they had wanted to then they would not
             have traded their technology for human lives. Using alien
             technology is not the same thing as develope our own
             technics. One thing is for sure and that is the fact that
             the aliens have some purpose for us. If they were just
             hostile creatures they would have killed us a long time ago.
             I think that they will use as as slaves, because we are not
             as intelligent as they are and we are many thousands of years
             behind them in technology. The killing of the weak humans using
             drugs is other proof. Who wants weak slaves? The Romans did
             not, nor did the egyptians. If they were on mission of peace then
             they would not have intefered with our living on Earth, but
             the fact that they are abducting innocent people and cutting
             them into pieces means that they are hostile. If they had wanted
             to investigate humans they would have snatched some books and
             learned the needed information from them. Or from some
             doctors and scientists. Or then they just want to learn of us
             using their own methods.

             But the slave thing is also uncertain; why to see so much
             trouble and use thousands of years to create a slave.
             They could use their own people as slaves. And what would they
             want to do with slaves? Maybe they are just poor lonely things
             without any friends and want to create their own ideal mate.
             Or then they are just keeping an eye on us, because they
             do not want us to become hostile creatures. The humans are
             keen on fighting and maybe they want to chill us out.
             I sure hope that peace is their main goal.

             @{"But certainly this happened to the poor little elves :(" link "Pictures/Poorelf.iff/main" 0}

             3.... It is the time to meet with the aliens.

             I'm not sure, but I've predicted the final meeting to occur
             during the next fifty years. If the additional information is
             correct then that is true. It was said in one of the texts
             that the aliens have put some small implants into the brains
             of every 40th human. And it also stated that when the time
             comes the aliens will use the implants to control the humans.
             That leads to the conclusion that the final meeting will
             happen soon; as much as I know any additional cucumber
             put into any living being cannot not be found in the beings
             baby. Only the things that are written into the human's
             sex-genes will occur in the next generation.
             Why had the aliens implanted humans if the poor things were
             bout to die because of beign too old. What a waste of implants.
             Some logic please. I hope that they are coming while I live.
             I would like to kick some hostile alien butt. At least I
             would try.


             4.... Humans.

             What if we are the aliens' creations? What if they made the
             religions? When the aliens come with Jesus (also their creation)
             in the front of their lines some people are really going to get
             mad. Most propably they are going to go bananas.
             Well, I myself am not a believer. I knew long time ago
             that the aliens were playing with us, but did not have
             any material to proove that. Boy, did the aliens have fun while
             floating around places wearing funny feather costumes
             (Acting angels and stuff) and telling the people how to
             behave. Now I know it is true. Worshipping God is the same as
             worshipping aliens. But who had known that the aliens made
             the God up. Most evil, I say.


             5.... Other views.

             Perhaps all these UFO sights are phoney. Maybe CIA or some
             other major firm has succeeded in producing an ultimate war
             machine and they do not want to tell about it. So they
             established an attempt to fool the people while developing and
             testing their own gadget on Area-51 or in some other place.
             The false truth about having deals with UFOs would give a
             nice protection from the media and from other institutions which
             do not believe in UFOs.


             6.... Conclusion.

             I repeat that this matter is so huge and kept well in secret
             that it is very hard to tell who is right and who is wrong,
             but the day will come, which will answer to all our
             questions.

             The humans just cannot make things this big up themselves.
             The aliens are coming. Prepare yourselves for the
             final encounter.

             I had not been eating any mushrooms before writing this
             article. At least part of it is true and you will know it too
             after you have read the additional information.

                           Aliens - Always "IN"


   During the ages, parties come and go, boozes vary, clothes change.
   Only one thing stays. The extraterrestial weenies, horrors and
   monsters are always in and hot topic. The ancient greeks, egyptians,
   incas and even christians saw aliens. The bible is ridden with
   notes about aliens and their tricks. Just check it out.

   It depends on the current culture in which form we will see
   the aliens. They are clever and seem to love a good theatre play
   and have a lot of different costumes to dress on and fool us
   stupid humans. Perhaps we have finally advanced enough in order
   to see their real outlook. Or perhaps not. Current one (gray
   little fellas with big black eyes) may be as fishy as all of
   their previous forms.

   As Teuvo told in his article, there's just so many possibilities
   of alien existence. Then why just one race? There must be plenty
   of them. Or perhaps earth is currently a personal playground
   for just one race. This is quite boring for us. We'd like more
   relationships with interesting species, not only this one for
   now and forever. Remember all boys and girls, if you will be
   abducted, please tell them that we want more friends to do
   some cultural exchange with.

   Here below is a neat piece of an ancient book about aliens.
   Perhaps during the 7th century they were quite close to the
   truth. At least the information stated in it has been so
   original and personal that it has set directions for many
   researchers and writers today. It also contains a nice and
   modern theory of different planes and their suitability for life.


   This etext version of the book, Al Azif has been entered into
   Hypertext by Ken Ottinger over the course of some few months. This
   project was completely funded by the Universal Life Trust.

   Ye Book of Ye Arab, Abdul Alhazred, 730 at Damascus
     _________________________________________________________________

   Of Ye Old Ones and their Spawn



   The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are and the Old Ones shall be. From
   the dark stars They came ere man was born, unseen and loathsome They
   descended to primal earth.

   Beneath the oceans They brooded while ages past, till seas gave up the
   land, whereupon They swarmed forth in Their multitudes and darkness
   ruled the Earth.

   At the frozen Poles They raised mighty cities, and upon high places
   the temples of Those whome nature owns not and the Gods have cursed.

   And the spawn of the Old Ones covered the Earth, and Their children
   endureth throughout the ages. Ye shantaks of Leng are the work of
   Their hands, the Ghasts who dwelleth in Zin's primordial vaults know
   Them as their Lords. They have fathered the Na-Hag and the Gaunts that
   ride the Night; Great Cthulhuis Their brother, the shaggoths Their
   slaves. The Dholes do homage unto Them in the nighted vale of Pnoth
   and Gugs sing Their praises beneath the peaks of ancient Throk.

   They have walked amidst the stars and They have walked the Earth. The
   City of Irem in the great desert has known Them; Leng in the Cold
   Waste has seen Their passing, the timeless citadel upon the
   cloud-vieled heights of unknown Kadath beareth Their mark.

   Wantonly the Old Ones trod the ways of darkness and Their blasphemies
   were great upon the Earth; all creation bowed beneath Their might and
   knew Them for Their wickedness.

   And the Elder Lords opened Their eyes and beheld the abominations of
   Those that ravaged the Earth. In Their wrath They set their hand
   against the Old Ones, staying Them in the midst of Their iniquity and
   casting Them forth from the Earth to the Void beyond the planes where
   chaos reigns and form abideth not. And the Elder Lords set Their seal
   upon the Gateway and the power of the Old Ones prevailest not against
   its might.

   Loathsome Cthulhu rose then from the deeps and raged with exceeding
   great fury against the Earth Guardians. And They bound his venomous
   claws with potent spells and sealed him up within the City of R'lyeh
   wherein beneath the waves he shall sleep death's dream until the end
   of the Aeon.

   Beyond the Gate dwell now the Old Ones; not in the spaces known unto
   men but in the angles betwixt them. Outside Earth's plane They linger
   and ever awaite the time of Their return; for the Earth has known Them
   and shall know Them in time yet to come.

   And the Old Ones hold foul and formless Azathoth for Their Master abd
   Abide with Him in the black cavern at the centre of all infinity,
   where he gnaws ravenously in ultimate chaos amid the mad beating of
   hidden drums, the tuneless piping of hideous flutes and the ceaseless
   bellowing of blind idiot gods that shamble and gesture aimlessly for
   ever.

   The soul of Azathoth dwelleth in Yog-sothoth and He shall beckon unto
   the Old Ones when the stars mark the time of Their coming; for
   Yog-sothoth is the Gate through which Those of the Void will re-enter.
   Yog-sothoth knowest the mazes of of time, for all time is one unto
   Him. He knowest where the Old Ones came forth in time along long past
   and where They shall come forth again when the cycle returneth.

          @{"Yog-Sothoth doing cultural exchange (Artists view)" link "Pictures/yog-sothoth.iff/main" 0}

   After day cometh night; man's day shall pass, and They shall rule
   where They once ruled. As foulness you shall know them and Their
   accursedness shall stain the Earth.
