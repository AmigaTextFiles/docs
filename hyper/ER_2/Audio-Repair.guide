@node 2 "Chapter 2) Introduction"

2.1) Why is all that junk in your attic?

If you have ever tried to get a piece of consumer electronic equipment
repaired, you understand why so much dead stuff is likely to be gathering
dust in your attic or basement closet or junk box. It does not pay! This may
be partially by design. However, to be fair, it may take just as much time to
diagnose and repair a problem with a $20 Walkman as a $300 VCR and time is
money for a repair shop. It is often not even economical to repair the more
expensive equipment let alone a $40 answering machine. The cost of the
estimate alone would probably buy at least one new unit and possibly many
more.

However, if you can do the repair yourself, the equation changes dramatically
as your parts costs will be 1/2 to 1/4 of what a professional will charge and
of course your time is free. The educational aspects may also be appealing.
You will learn a lot in the process. Many problems can be solved quickly and
inexpensively. Fixing an old boombox to take take to the beach may just make
sense after all.

This document provides maintenance and repair information for a variety of
consumer electronic devices not covered by other chapters in the "Notes on
Repair of" series. Suggestions for additions (and, of course, correction) are
always welcome.

You will be able to diagnose problems and in most cases, correct them as
well.  As most difficulties encountered with this type of equipment are
mechanical, there is significant emphasis on dirt, lubrication, deteriorated
rubber parts, broken doohickies, and so forth. With minor exceptions,
specific manufacturers and models will not be covered as there are so many
variations that such a treatment would require a huge and very detailed text.
Rather, the most common problems will be addressed and enough basic
principles of operation will be provided to enable you to narrow the problem
down and likely determine a course of action for repair - or decide that
replacement is indeed the better option. However, in many cases, you will be
able to do what is required to repair a piece of equipment for a fraction of
what would be charged by a repair center. Perhaps, you will even be able to
revive something that would otherwise have gone into the dumpster - or
remained in that closet until you moved out of your house (or longer)!

Should you still not be able to find a solution, you will have learned a
great deal and be able to ask appropriate questions and supply relevant
information if you decide to post to sci.electronics.repair. It will also be
easier to do further research using a repair book or guide. In any case, you
will have the satisfaction of knowing you did as much as you could before
finally giving up or (if it is worthwhile cost-wise) taking it in for
professional repair. With your new-found knowledge, you will have the upper
hand and will not easily be snowed by a dishonest or incompetent technician.

If you are just getting started, you should refer to "Repair Briefs, an
Introduction" for additional troubleshooting tips, recommended test
equipment, suggested parts inventory, and other general information.

2.2) Information on consumer electronics technology

Your local public library (621.384 if your library is numbered that way) or
technical bookstore represents a valuable resource for books on both the
technology and repair of a large variety of consumer electronics devices.

For an on line introduction to a variety of equipment, point your web browser
to the Magnavox reference page at the following URL:

http://www.magnavox.com/electreference/electreference.html

There you will find links to a number of articles on the basic principles of
operation of CD players, laserdisc and optical drives, TVs, VCRs, camcorders,
loudspeakers, satellite receivers, and other consumer A/V equipment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode

@node 3.1 "Safety"

The only danger to you in most of these devices is the AC line connection (if
any) and getting sucked into any mechanical people traps. Before you plug in
the unit with any covers removed, make note and cover up any exposed AC line
connections. The rest of the circuitry is low voltage and while you can
destroy your equipment by your actions, you should be fairly safe. Exceptions
to this are noted where appropriate.

However, you never can tell where an exciting troubleshooting expedition will
lead. The following Safety Guidelines are included for your survival when
working on line connected or high voltage equipment (and your reading
enjoyment).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 3.2 "Safety guidelines"

These guidelines are to protect you from potentially deadly electrical shock
hazards as well as the equipment from accidental damage.

Note that the danger to you is not only in your body providing a conducting
path, particularly through your heart. Any involuntary muscle contractions
caused by a shock, while perhaps harmless in themselves, may cause collateral
damage - there are many sharp edges inside this type of equipment as well as
other electrically live parts you may contact accidentally.

The purpose of this set of guidelines is not to frighten you but rather to
make you aware of the appropriate precautions. Repair of TVs, monitors,
microwave ovens, and other consumer and industrial equipment can be both
rewarding and economical. Just be sure that it is also safe!

   o Don't work alone - in the event of an emergency another person's
     presence may be essential.

   o Always keep one hand in your pocket when anywhere around a powered
     line-connected or high voltage system.

   o Wear rubber bottom shoes or sneakers.

   o Wear eye protection - large plastic lensed eyeglasses or safety goggles.

   o Don't wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact
     circuitry and conduct current, or get caught in moving parts.

   o Set up your work area away from possible grounds that you may
     accidentally contact.

   o Know your equipment: TVs and monitors may use parts of the metal chassis
     as ground return yet the chassis may be electrically live with respect
     to the earth ground of the AC line. Microwave ovens use the chassis as
     ground return for the high voltage. In addition, do not assume that the
     chassis is a suitable ground for your test equipment!

   o If circuit boards need to be removed from their mountings, put
     insulating material between the boards and anything they may short to.
     Hold them in place with string or electrical tape. Prop them up with
     insulation sticks - plastic or wood.

   o If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits with power
     off, discharge (across) large power supply filter capacitors with a 2 W
     or greater resistor of 100-500 ohms/V approximate value (e.g., for a 200
     V capacitor, use a 20K-100K ohm resistor). Monitor while discharging
     and/or verify that there is no residual charge with a suitable
     voltmeter.

   o For TVs and monitors in particular, there is the additional danger of
     CRT implosion - take care not to bang the CRT envelope with your tools.
     An implosion will scatter shards of glass at high velocity in every
     direction. There is several tons of force attempting to crush the
     typical CRT. Always wear eye protection.

   o Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered and
     unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped
     locations or difficult to access locations.

   o If you must probe live, put electrical tape over all but the last 1/16"
     of the test probes to avoid the possibility of an accidental short which
     could cause damage to various components. Clip the reference end of the
     meter or scope to the appropriate ground return so that you need to only
     probe with one hand.

   o Perform as many tests as possible with power off and the equipment
     unplugged. For example, the semiconductors in the power supply section
     of a TV or monitor can be tested for short circuits with an ohmmeter.

   o Use an isolation transformer if there is any chance of contacting line
     connected circuits. A Variac(tm) is not an isolation transformer! The
     use of GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet is a
     good idea but will not protect you from shock from many points in a line
     connected TV or monitor, or the high voltage side of a microwave oven,
     for example. A circuit breaker is too slow and insensitive to provide
     any protection for you or in many cases, your equipment. The GFCI may
     protect your scope probe from smoking if you accidentally connect its
     ground to a live chassis.

   o Don't attempt repair work when you are tired. Not only will you be more
     careless, but your primary diagnostic tool - deductive reasoning - will
     not be operating at full capacity.

   o Finally, never assume anything without checking it out for yourself!
     Don't take shortcuts!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 3.3 "Troubleshooting tips"

Many problems have simple solutions. Don't immediately assume that your
problem is some combination of esoteric complex convoluted failures. For a
tape deck, it may just be a bad belt or a bad tape. Try to remember that the
problems with the most catastrophic impact on operation (a dead AC adapter)
have the simplest solutions (repair the wires broken due to flexing in the
power cable).

If you get stuck, sleep on it. Sometimes, just letting the problem bounce
around in your head will lead to a different more successful approach or
solution. Don't work when you are really tired - it is both dangerous and
mostly non-productive (or possibly destructive).

Whenever working on precision equipment, make copious notes and diagrams. You
will be eternally grateful when the time comes to reassemble the unit. Most
connectors are keyed against incorrect insertion or interchange of cables,
but not always. Apparently identical screws may be of differing lengths or
have slightly different thread types. Little parts may fit in more than one
place or orientation. Etc. Etc.

Pill bottles, film canisters, and plastic ice cube trays come in handy for
sorting and storing screws and other small parts after disassembly.

Select a work area which is well lighted and where dropped parts can be
located - not on a deep pile shag rug. Something like a large plastic tray
with a slight lip may come in handy as it prevents small parts from rolling
off of the work table. The best location will also be relatively dust free
and allow you to suspend your troubleshooting to eat or sleep or think
without having to pile everything into a cardboard box for storage.

Another consideration is ESD - Electro-Static Discharge. The electronic
components in a some devices like cassette decks, Walkmen, and portable
phones, are vulnerable to ESD. There is no need to go overboard but taking
reasonable precautions like not wearing clothing made of wool that tends to
generate static. When working on larger devices like cassette decks, get into
the habit of touching a ground like the metal chassis before touching any
circuit components.

A basic set of precision hand tools will be all you need to disassemble and
perform adjustments on most consumer electronics equipment. These do not need
to be really expensive but poor quality tools are worse than useless and can
cause damage. Needed tools include a selection of Philips and straight blade
screwdrivers, needlenose pliers, wire cutters, tweezers, and dental picks. A
jeweler's screwdriver set is a must particularly if you are working on
compact equipment. For adjustments, a miniature (1/16" blade) screwdriver
with a non-metallic tip is desirable both to prevent the presence of metal
from altering the electrical properties of the circuit and to minimize the
possibility of shorting something from accidental contact with the circuitry.

A low power fine tip soldering iron and fine rosin core solder (never never
use acid core solder or the stuff for sweating copper pipes on electronic
equipment) will be needed if you should need to disconnect any soldered wires
(on purpose or by accident) or replace soldered components.

For thermal or warmup problems, a can of 'cold spray' or 'circuit chiller'
(they are the same) and a heat gun or blow dryer come in handy to identify
components whose characteristics may be drifting with temperature. Using the
extension tube of the spray can or making a cardboard nozzle for the heat gun
can provide very precise control of which components you are affecting.

For info on useful chemicals, adhesives, and lubricants, see "Repair Briefs,
an Introduction" as well as other documents available at this site.

@endnode
@node 3.4 "Test equipment"

Don't start with the electronic test equipment, start with some analytical
thinking. Many problems associated with consumer electronic equipment do not
require a schematic (though one may be useful). The majority of problems with
consumer electronics equipment are mechanical and can be dealt with using
nothing more than a good set of precision hand tools; some alcohol,
degreaser, contact cleaner, light oil and grease; and your powers of
observation (and a little experience). Your built in senses and that stuff
between your ears represents the most important test equipment you have.

A DMM or VOM is necessary for checking of power supply voltages and testing
of sensors, LEDs, switches, and other small components. This does not need to
be expensive but since you will be depending on its readings, reliability is
important. Even a relatively inexpensive DMM from Radio Shack will be fine
for most repair work. You will wonder how you ever lived without one! Cost:
$25-50.

Unless you get deep into electronic repair, a high bandwidth oscilloscope is
not required. However, a relatively inexpensive 5 or 10 MHz dual trace scope
is very handy and you will find all kinds of uses for it. Such a scope should
cost less than $150 on the used market.

There are several specific pieces of test equipment that you may already own
which are required depending on the devices being fixed.

Audio equipment:

   o Stereo tuner or other audio signal source. An audio signal generator is
     nice but not really essential.

   o An audio amp connected to a loudspeaker. The input should be selectable
     between line level and mic level and be brought out through a shielded
     cable to a test probe and ground clip. This is useful for tracing an
     audio circuit to determine where a signal is getting lost. Inexpensive
     signal tracers are also available but this option is likely free.

   o Prerecorded and garbage cassettes or tapes for testing of component and
     walkman tape transports.

Video games, cable boxes, and other video sources:

   o A TV (preferably color) with RF (antenna) inputs connected to a VCR with
     a working tuner and RF modulator or a TV with both RF and A/V (RCA
     jacks) inputs.

   o A known good game cartridge to confirm that the problem is in the game
     console.

Telephone equipment:

   o A working tone dialing phone. If I had a choice, it would be a good old
     reliable ATT Touch Tone desk phone.

   o A dual connector phone jack. Two independent phone lines are desirable
     for answering machine or modem testing.

   o A PC or laptop with a fax-modem (for modem and fax machine testing).

   o A low voltage DC power supply or wall wart to perform certain tests
     without a telephone connection or phone line simulator.

@node 3.5 "Getting inside consumer electronic equipment"

Yes, you will void the warranty, but you knew this already.

NOTE: the sections on @{"loudspeakers" link "6"}, @{"cameras" link "9"}, and @{"watches" link "8"} have additional
'getting inside' info.

Manufacturers seem to take great pride in being very mysterious as to how to
open their equipment. Not always, but this is too common to just be a
coincidence.

A variety of techniques are used to secure the covers on consumer electronic
equipment:

  1. Screws. Yes, many still use this somewhat antiquated technique.
     Sometimes, there are even embossed arrows on the case indicating which
     screws need to be removed to get at the guts. In addition to obvious
     screw holes, there may be some that are only accessible when a battery
     or cassette compartment is opened or a trim panel is popped off.

     These will often be of the Philips variety. (Strictly speaking, many of
     these are not actual Philips head screws but a slight variation.
     Nonetheless, a Philips screwdriver of suitable size will work on them.)
     A precision jeweler's screwdriver set including miniature Philips head
     drivers is a must for repair of miniature portable devices.

     Sometimes, you will find Torx or a variety of security type fasteners.
     Suitable driver bits are available. Sometimes, you can improvise using
     regular tools. In the case of security Torx, the center post can usually
     be broken off with a pair of needlenose pliers allowing a normal Torx
     driver to be used. In a pinch, a suitable size hex wrench can substitute
     for a Torx driver. Places like MCM Electronics carry a variety of
     security bits.

  2. Hidden screws. These will require prying up a plug or peeling off a
     decorative decal. It will be obvious that you were tinkering - it is
     virtually impossible to put a decal back in an undetectable way.
     Sometimes the rubber feet can be pryed out revealing screw holes. For a
     stick-on label, rubbing your finger over it may permit you to locate a
     hidden screw hole. Just puncture the label to access the screw as this
     may be less messy then attempting to peel it off.

  3. Snaps. Look around the seam between the two halves. You may (if you are
     lucky) see points at which gently (or forcibly) pressing with a
     screwdriver will unlock the covers. Sometimes, just going around the
     seam with a butter knife will pop the cover at one location which will
     then reveal the locations of the other snaps.

  4. Glue. Or more likely, the plastic is fused together. This is
     particularly common with AC adapters (wall warts). In this case, I
     usually carefully go around the seam with a hacksaw blade taking extreme
     care not to go through and damage internal components. Reassemble with
     plastic electrical tape.

  5. It isn't designed for repair. Don't laugh. I feel we will see more and
     more of this in our disposable society. Some devices are totally potted
     in Epoxy and are throwaways. With others, the only way to open them
     non-destructively is from the inside.

Don't force anything unless you are sure there is no alternative - most of
the time, once you determine the method of fastening, covers will come apart
easily. If they get hung up, there may be an undetected screw or snap still
in place.

The most annoying (to be polite) situation is when after removing the 18
screws holding the case together (losing 3 of them entirely and mangling the
heads on 2 others), removing three subassemblies, and two other circuit
boards, you find that the adjustment you wanted was accessible through a hole
in the case just by partially peeling back a rubber hand grip!

When reassembling the equipment make sure to route cables and other wiring
such that they will not get pinched or snagged and possibly broken or have
their insulation nicked or pierced and that they will not get caught in
moving parts. Replace any cable ties that were cut or removed during
disassembly and add additional ones of your own if needed. Some electrical
tape may sometimes come in handy to provide insulation insurance as well.

@node 3.6 "Getting built up dust and dirt out of a equipment"

This should be the first step in any inspection and cleaning procedure.

Do not be tempted to use compressed air!

I would quicker use a soft brush to carefully dust off the circuit boards and
power supply. Work in such a way that the resulting dust does not fall on the
mechanical parts.

For intricate mechanisms, using compressed air could dislodge dirt and dust
which may then settle on lubricated parts contaminating them. High pressure
air could move oil or grease from where it is to where it should not be. If
you are talking about a shop air line, the pressure may be much much too high
and there may be contaminants as well.

A Q-tip (cotton swab) moistened with politically correct alcohol can be used
to remove dust and dirt from various surfaces of the deck (in addition to the
normal proper cleaning procedures for the guides, rollers, heads, wheels,
belts, etc.)

@node 3.7 "What to do if a tiny tiny part falls inside"

We have all done this: a tiny washer or spring pops off and disappears from
sight inside the guts of the unit. Don't panic. First - unplug it if AC
powered. Remove the battery pack if possible from a portable device.

Try to locate the part with a bright light without moving anything. You may
have gotten lucky (yeh, right). Next, over an area where a dropped part will
be visible (not a shag carpet!), try any reasonable means to shake it loose -
upside down, a little gently tapping and shaking, etc. A hard surface is
better in some ways as you might hear the part drop. On the other hand it may
bounce into the great beyond.

If this does not work, you have two options:

  1. Assume that the part has landed in a place that will not cause future
     problems. There could be electrical problems if it is metallic and
     shorts out some circuitry or there could be mechanical problems if it
     jams some part of the mechanism. There is an excellent chance that the
     part will never cause any harm. What chance? I don't know, maybe 99%. It
     is not worth taking the unit to pieces to locate the part. You are more
     likely to damage something else in the process. Obtain a replacement and
     get on with your life. The exception is, of course, if you now begin
     experiencing problems you **know** were not there before.

  2. Take the unit to pieces in an attempt to locate the part. For all you
     know, it may be clear across the room and you will never find it inside.
     If all the gymnastics have not knocked it loose, then it may be really
     wedged somewhere and will stay there - forever. If the unit behaves
     normally, then in all likelihood it will continue to do so.

To prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future you will no doubt
be much more careful. Sure you will! Keeping one finger on a little part like
an E-clip as it is removed will tend to prevent uncontrolled ejection as
well.

@node 4.1 "Parts of an audio tape transport"

The following description applies to most cassette and open reel tape
transports including those used in portable and microcassette recorders,
Walkmen, and telephone answering machines.

Looking at the top of the deck such that the tape heads are at the bottom:

   o Supply reel table - left hand side platform on which the supply tape
     reel sits. Edge which contacts idler tire (if used) should be cleaned.

   o Takeup reel table - right hand side platform on which the takeup tape
     reel sits. Edge which contacts idler tire (if used) should be cleaned.

   o Idler - assembly which swings between supply and takeup reels and
     transfers power to the appropriate reel to wind the tape up during play
     and record and often to drive FF and REW. In some designs, this uses
     gears or some other type of mechanism. In very expensive decks,
     individual motors are used for each reel and there is no intermediate
     drive.

   o Idler tire - the black rubber ring on the outside of one part of the
     idler which actually contacts the reel edges. This is not as common in
     audio tape decks as VCRs. If one is used, it should be cleaned and
     inspected for deterioration, dirt, and wear.

   o Capstan - right side after tape exits from area of record/playback/erase
     heads. The capstan is a shaft (about 1/16" diameter in cassette decks,
     recorders, and Walkmen, 3/16" or larger diameter in open reel machines)
     which during play and record modes precisely controls tape movement when
     the pinch roller is pressed against it. For autoreverse transports,
     there will be two capstans - one on each side of the head assembly so
     that the tape is always pulled across the heads as this is most precise.
     (In a VCR, there is only one capstan and it is also used for reverse
     play or search modes.) Clean to assure proper tape movement during play
     and record modes.

   o Pinch Roller - black rubber roller which spins freely and is pressed
     against the capstan during play, record, and search modes. For
     autoreverse decks, there will be two pinch rollers, one for each
     capstan. A hard, shiny, cracked, or dried out pinch roller can lead to
     tape edge munching and erratic or wavering sound. Clean thoroughly
     (until no more black stuff comes off). Inspect for cracked or
     deteriorated rubber.

   o Tape heads. Most low to mid priced tape decks have two - an erase head
     and a combined record/playback head. High-end decks will have separate
     record and playback heads supporting sound-on-sound mixing to the same
     track and allowing recording quality to be monitored off of the tape.
     These may be physically independent assemblies or combined into a single
     unit. Autoreverse decks often have a head assembly that rotates 180
     degrees depending on tape direction. This is less expensive than having
     two erase heads and two record/playback heads or a single
     record/playback head that shifted position to align with the appropriate
     tracks and electronic switching of the record and playback signals.

     Play-only transports such as found in car cassette decks and Walkmen do
     not need an erase head. Autoreverse play-only decks often do just shift
     the position of the playback head a fraction of a mm depending on
     playback direction to line up with the tracks and interchanges the
     connections for L and R channels.

     Clean the polished surfaces thoroughly (DO NOT use anything abrasive!).

   o Various other guide posts - vertical stationary metal posts which tape
     contacts. Should be cleaned but rarely need adjustment.

   o Belts - various size black rubber bands - a typical transport will have
     between 0 and 4 belts, usually below decks. These will require
     replacement after a few years. Clean and inspect.

@endnode
@node 4.2 "General guide to tape deck cleaning and rubber parts replacement"

The following procedures apply to boom boxes, cassette decks, microcassette
and other portable tape recorders, open reel tape decks, and telephone
answering machines. While the tape transports used in these devices are less
complex than those used in VCRs and other helical scan recording equipment,
some routine maintenance can go a long way towards preventing future
problems.  All the guideposts, wheels, and rubber parts should be inspected
and cleaned periodically - how often depends on usage. Of course, no one
really does this unless something goes wrong.

Qtips and alcohol (91% medicinal is ok, pure isopropyl is better. Avoid
rubbing alcohol especially if it contains any additives) can be used
everywhere EXCEPT on the rotating heads of VCRs and camcorders (and other
helical scan devices like 8mm and 4mm (DAT) storage drives) - see the "Notes
on VCR Failure Diagnosis and Repair" for detailed procedures on cleaning of
video heads - you can destroy the most expensive part of your VCR by improper
cleaning techniques. Dry quickly to avoid leaving residue behind. Sometimes
good old fashioned water (just a damp cloth) will work better on sugar based
gunk and other kids' grime.

Cleaning may get your machine going well enough to get by until any
replacement rubber parts arrive.

Things to clean:

(Some of these components may not be present in your particular equipment).

  1. Capstan and pinch roller. These collect a lot of crud mostly oxide which
     flakes off of (old) tapes. Use as many Q-tips (wet but not dripping with
     alcohol) as necessary to remove all foreign matter from the capstan (the
     shiny shaft that pulls the tape through the unit for play and record).
     Just don't get impatient and use something sharp - the crud will come
     off with the Qtips and maybe some help from a fingernail. On autoreverse
     decks, there will usually be two capstans and pinch rollers.

     Clean the pinch roller (presses against the capstan in play and record)
     until no more black stuff comes off. Use as many Qtips as necessary.

     If the pinch roller is still hard and/or shiny or has a cracked surface,
     it will probably need replacement. Many are available from the sources
     listed in the section: @{"Recommended parts suppliers" link "16.3"}

  2. Various guideposts that the tape contacts. Clean like the capstan.

  3. Idler tire (idler swings between reels and transfers motor power to
     reels - clean until no more black stuff comes off. A dirty or worn idler
     tire may prevent the takeup reel from turning resulting in spilled tape.

     Also, the idler assembly includes a slip clutch. If this weakens, the
     idler may not have enough force to press on the reel table edges.

  4. Reel table edges - surface on the reel tables where the idler contacts.

  5. Audio head(s) and erase head. Q-tips and alcohol are ok for these. Do
     not use anything sharp or abrasive!

  6. Anything else that the tape contacts on its exciting journey through
     your machine.

  7. Rubber belts. Access to some of these may require the services of a
     Swiss watchmaker (if any still exist). Some boomboxes seem to be
     designed specifically to be difficult to service. After noting where
     each belt goes, remove them individually (if possible) and clean with
     alcohol and Qtips or a lint free cloth. Dry quickly to avoid degrading
     the rubber from contact with the alcohol. If a belt is trapped by some
     assembly and not easy to remove, use the Qtip on the belt and/or pulley
     in place. However, if it is stretched, flabby, or damaged, you will need
     to figure out how to free it.

     Note that on some equipment like dual cassette boomboxes and telephone
     answering machines, the belt(s) may follow a highly circuitous path -
     make a detailed diagram!

     Any belts that appear loose, flabby or do not return instantly to their
     relaxed size when stretched by 25% or so will need to be replaced and
     may be the cause of your problems. Belts cost about $.30-$2.00.
     Meanwhile, the belts will function better once they are cleaned, maybe
     just enough to get by until your replacements arrive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.3 "Lubrication of electronic equipment"

The short recommendation is: Don't add any oil or grease unless you are
positively sure it is needed. Most parts are lubricated at the factory and do
not need any further lubrication over their lifetime. Too much lubrication is
worse then too little. It is easy to add a drop of oil but difficult and time
consuming to restore a tape deck that has taken a swim.

NEVER, ever, use WD40! WD40 is not a good lubricant despite the claims on the
label. Legend has it that the WD stands for Water Displacer - which is one of
the functions of WD40 when used to coat tools for rust prevention. WD40 is
much too thin to do any good as a general lubricant and will quickly collect
dirt and dry up.

A light machine oil like electric motor or sewing machine oil should be used
for gear or wheel shafts. A plastic safe grease like silicone grease or
Molylube is suitable for gears, cams, or mechanical (piano key) type mode
selectors. Never use oil or grease on electrical contacts.

Unless the unit was not properly lubricated at the factory (which is quite
possible), don't add any unless your inspection reveals the specific need.
Sometimes you will find a dry capstan, motor, lever, or gear shaft. If
possible, disassemble and clean out the old lubricant before adding fresh oil
or grease.

Note that in most cases, oil is for plain bearings (not ball or roller) and
pivots while grease is used on sliding parts and gear teeth.

In general, do not lubricate anything unless you know there is a need. Never
'shotgun' a problem by lubricating everything in sight! You might as well
literally use a shotgun on the equipment!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.4 "Tape Head demagnetizing"

With audio tape decks, demagnetizing is often recommended to improve sound
quality and frequency response. There is some debate as to how much benefit
there is to this practice but if done properly, there is little risk.
Demagnetizing removes the residual magnetic fields that can build up on
ferrous pole pieces of the tape heads and various guideposts and other parts
in the tape path which may affect frequency response.

Use a small demagnetizer designed for a tape deck or cassette deck. Do not
use anything homemade that might be too powerful or a bulk tape eraser which
would certainly be too powerful.

Make sure the tip is covered with a soft material to prevent damage to the
finely polished surfaces in the tape transport.

Turn power on to the demagnetizer when a couple of feet away from the unit.
Then, slowly bring it in close and slowly go over all surfaces of anything
that the tape contacts or comes close to in the tape path. The key word here
is SLOWLY. Move fast, and you will make the magnetic fields stronger. When
finished, slowly draw the demagnetizer away to a distance of a couple of feet
before turning it off.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.5 "Tape or cassette deck, recorder, or Walkman transport problems"

The following are common problems with audio tape transports:

  1. No movement in PLAY or REC - most likely capstan is not turning or not
     engaged. If the motor is not working (listen for a hum from inside the
     transport), refer to the sections on @{"motor" link "13"} problems. Otherwise, see the
     list below.

  2. Tape eating - the capstan is turning but the takeup reel is stationary
     or not turning rapidly enough to take up the tape as it feeds from the
     capstan/pinch roller.

  3. FF and/or REW are inoperative or sluggish - assuming the motor is
     working, the driven reel is not being powered at all or does not have
     sufficient torque to overcome the tape friction. The driven reel alone
     must pull the tape through the transport.

Note that the required torque for the driven reel is much less for PLAY and
REC compared to FF and REW as the capstan in contact with the pinch roller
pulls the tape from the supply reel.

The most likely causes are similar for all of these symptoms. The driven reel
and/or capstan is not turning due to:

   o A broken or stretched belt, an old and deteriorated, dirty, or worn
     idler tire. Refer to the section: 
     @{"General guide to cleaning and rubber parts replacement" link "4.2"}

   o Worn or broken. For example, a spring may have popped off an idler
     clutch or a press-fit gear or pulley may have split.

   o Gummed up lubrication which is preventing the idler gear or tire that
     operates the takeup reel from engaging. See the section: 
     @{"Lubrication of electronic equipment" link "4.3"}

   o A solenoid that is not engaging properly due to a weak spring,
     insufficient drive, or lubrication problems.

If the cause is not immediately evident once the bottom of the transport is
visible, try to observe exactly what is happening when you play a garbage
tape or run the deck with no tape present. Look for broken parts or bits of
parts that may have failed off.

If the transport shuts down shortly after entering any mode, check for a
missing or stretched tape counter drive belt or a defective reel rotation
sensor. The tape eating protection circuits are shutting down the unit
improperly due to a lack of reel sensor pulses. A related symptom will be
that the tape counter (mechanical or electronic) does not change during the
period when the tape is moving.

If the logic is not properly controlling the various solenoids or other
actuators in a 'soft touch deck', then a service manual will be needed to
proceed much further.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.6 "Tape transport azimith adjustment"

When prerecorded tapes or tapes recorded on another deck sound muddy, the
azimith alignment of the suspect deck may have shifted or be misadjusted.
Azimith refers to the angle that the record/playback head gap makes with
respect to recorded audio tracks. This angle should be exactly 90 degrees. If
it is not, than high frequencies will tend to be reduced in amplitude during
playback of a tape not recorded on this machine. Similarly, a tape recorded
on a transport with an improper azimith setting will sound muddy on a
properly adjusted deck.

A simple test to determine if azimith alignment is your problem is to record
some music on your machine and immediately play it back. If this recording
sounds fine but it sounds muddy on another deck, then improper azimith
alignment is the likely cause.

If the recording is still muddy, your deck may have electronic problems like
excessive bias (check to make sure you have selected the proper type of tape
or bias setting), a worn record/playback head, or the heads or other parts
may be magnetized (see the section: @{"Tape head demagnetizing" link "4.4"}. However,
dirty heads as well other mechanical problems can also result in weak muddy
sound. See the section: 
@{"General guide to tape deck cleaning and rubber parts replacement" link "4.2"}

The best way to adjust azimith is while playing a recording that was made on
a known good deck - commercial tapes are usually (but not always) a good
choice.

WARNING: once you adjust the azimith, any tapes previously recorded on this
transport may sound muddy. If you only record and play your own tapes on this
deck, you may want to just leave it alone.

The azimith adjustment is usually a screw that pivots the record/playback
head. It may be spring loaded and possibly fixed in place with a some Loctite
or varnish. Often it will be accessible through a hole without removing any
covers but not always. Look for it while in play or record mode in back of
any holes (which you had no idea had a purpose until now). If there are no
access holes, you will have to remove the loading door, cover, or front
panel.  Be sure you have the correct screw before turning wildly - others may
affect critical height or simply be mounting screws.

Play a tape with lots of good highs - classical instrumental music or jazz
are excellent. Now, simply set the azimith adjustment for best sounding and
strongest high frequencies which should result in most natural sound. Go slow
- a 1/16 of a turn is significant. Turn the screw back and forth and leave it
in the best sounding position. Carefully put a dab of Loctite or nail polish
on the screw to prevent it from moving.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.7 "Walkman/Discman power or sound intermittent"

NOTE: for actual tape speed, operation, or sound quality issues, see the
sections on tape transports.

The socket that the AC adapter or headphones plug into is often quite abused
during normal operation. This can lead to broken solder connections where it
joins the circuit board inside the unit. Test for this possibility by
wiggling the plug without moving or flexing the cable itself. If the sound
cuts in and out or the tape player starts and stops or the radio goes on and
off, or the CD player resets or stops, then there is likely a bad connection
here. NOTE: eliminate the alternate possibility that the AC adapter or
headphone cable is bad by wiggling and tugging on the cable while holding the
plug steady. Further verify that it is not simply a matter of dirt or grime
interfering with a good connection.

The connections can be easily resoldered but you will need to open up the
case using. Hopefully this will only require jeweler's screwdrivers and great
care. (However, some Walkmen are constructed such that access to the interior
is virtually impossible without a hand-grenade.) To repair the connections,
use a low wattage iron and fine rosin core solder. Make sure you do not
introduce any solder bridges. Try not to lose any of the microscrews.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.8 "Cassette or tape playback - one channel dead"

This could be a bad playback head, bad connections, or a bad component in the
playback electronics.

First, confirm that the problem is not in your headphones, patch cables, or
the remainder of your audio system - try an alternate audio source where
possible.

To determine if the playback circuitry is working, gain access to the
terminals on the playback head - a metal cased little cube near the center of
the tape side of the cassette. There should be four wires coming from it.
While the machine is supposed to be playing, touch the end of a jeweler's
screwdriver gently to each of the four terminals in turn. When you touch the
good channel, you should hear a buzz from the appropriate speaker. If you
touch one terminal and get a buzz from the 'dead' channel, then it is
possible that the head is bad for that channel. If you can touch two
different terminals and get a buzz in the bad channel for both, the it is
likely that the ground connection to the input preamp has fallen off. If you
do not get anything from the bad channel, then there is likely an electronic
problem in that channel. Bad connections aside, the most common problem area
would be the audio amplifier - bad IC or capacitor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.9 "Distorted or erratic recording"

First determine if it is a record or playback problem - play a tape recorded
on another machine or a commercial prerecorded tape. Try a tape from this
machine on another known working tape player.

If record is the problem and it has very distorted sound, this may be a sign
of a bad bias oscillator or switching circuit or record switch. The bias is
an ultrasonic signal that is impressed on the tape along with the input
signal. Without it, the sound will be highly distorted. In effect, it is a
linearizing signal.

Check that the record select switch is clean - it may have many contacts and
may have collected a lot of crud. If behavior changes with each activation of
the record switch, get some contact or tuner cleaner spray and use the
extension tube to spray inside the switch (with the power off), put the
switch through its paces several times and allow to dry before powering it
up.

If it is a portable subject to abuse, check for bad connections as well,
especially if, say, one channel comes and goes.

Beyond this, you can try to measure the signal going to the record heads
while in record mode. You should be able to see a high frequency signal in
addition to the input signal. If the either of these is absent, then you need
to trace back to its source and at this point will probably need a schematic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.10 "Cassette player erratic autoreverse"

Some of the autoreverse decks use a rotating magnet under or part of the each
reel and a reed switch or hall effect device to detect lack of motion and do
the autoreverse thing.

I had one from a Toyota where the plastic drive gear which included the
magnet and was part of the reel split and was getting stuck at the broken
tooth causing a reverse and eventually eating the tape. It was $9 for that
little plastic gear.

Others are entirely mechanical and if there is a lack of lubrication, dirt,
tired belts or idlers, or broken parts they may start acting erratically.

Although there could be an electronic fault, carefully examine the mechanism
for obvious or subtle problems before breaking out the 'scope.

The following methods are use for autoreverse:

  1. Optical sensor detecting the clear leader on the cassette. Better tape
     decks use this for sensing at the end so that the reverse occurs just
     quickly at the end of the tape rather than waiting for the leader to go
     by and a second or two for the tape to stop.

  2. Totally mechanical where a lever arm presses against the tape and when
     the tension increases with the reel stopped, it trips a mechanism to
     reverse.

  3. Optical sensors on reel rotation.

  4. Magnetic sensors on reel rotation - either hall effect devices or simple
     reed switches.

If the transport will run without a tape in place, see if the takeup reel is
rotating properly and whether the reverse still occurs. If reel rotation is
normal but it still reverses, the either you have the optical tape end sensor
or there is some fault in the sensors for the reel rotation. If the takeup
reel does not rotate, then as suggested above, check for bad belts or idler
tire.

Belts and idler tires are readily available from places like MCM Electronics.

@endnode
@node 4.11 "General tape speed problems - slow, fast, or dead"

Are the speed problems sudden or gradual? Over what period of time? Seconds,
minutes? For portable devices, are you using a good set of their recommended
type of batteries?

Did this problem start suddenly or was this a tape recorder you found buried
under an inch thick layer of dust in an attic?

If the latter, then there could very well be multiple mechanical problems due
to deteriorated rubber parts - replace then or toss it.

Fast play could be an indication of a hard deteriorated pinch roller.

Clean and lubricate the mechanism. Check for dry or tight bearings.

Is there any pattern to the problems - like with respect to the start and end
of cassettes?

If the tape speed has suddenly become excessive:

  1. Mechanical. If you had a recent tape eating episode, there may be a wad
     of tape wrapped around the capstan. Remove it. Alternatively, the pinch
     roller may not be fully engaging against the capstan and the takeup reel
     is simply pulling the tape through without any speed control. Clean the
     mechanism, check for tired belts and springs.

  2. Electrical. The motor speed control is not working. This may be either a
     mechanical governor inside the motor or a voltage regulator or other
     electronic control often also inside the motor. In the latter case, you
     may be able to disassemble the motor and repair it. One possibility is
     that the series regulator has decided to turn into a short circuit. This
     may be external or internal to the motor.

Slight tape speed error may simply mean that an adjustment is needed. There
may be an access hole on the motor or an external pot. Keep in mind that any
tapes you recorded on this machine (assuming it can record) recently will
play at an incorrect speed once you adjust the speed.

Is it slow and steady - no more wow and flutter than normal? Or slow and
erratic indicating that (1) the speed regulator is faulty, (2) some bearings
may need oil, (3) the pinch roller is glazed.

If the mechanics seem ok, then check for electronic problems with the motor
or regulator. Sometimes there is a trimpot for speed adjustment inside or
external to the motor. A faulty regulator or even a bad connection may be the
cause.

A variety of techniques are used to regulate the record/playback speed:

  1. Mechanical governor inside motor - centrifugal contacts open at correct
     speed reducing current to motor. If speed is too low, than springs could
     have weakened or contacts could be bad - open. If speed is too high,
     contacts may be welded closed. There may be a resistor and/or capacitor
     across the contacts. An open resistor could conceivably cause unstable
     speed fluctuations. A capacitor may be present to reduce electrical
     noise.

  2. Voltage regulator inside motor case or external to motor. The regulator
     or transistor may be faulty. If power for the motor seems to come
     directly from an unregulated supply, check across the motor terminals
     with an ohmmeter. A low reading which is identical in both directions
     would indicate a direct connection to the motor brushes with no internal
     regulator. A high reading or one that is different in each direction
     indicates an internal electronic regulator - or you could just use your
     eyeballs to determine if there are any electronics inside the motor.
     These can be disassembled and bad parts replaced. There may be an access
     hole on the motor for an adjustment. Alternatively, you could remove the
     guts and install an external regulator using an LM317 or similar part.

  3. Active regulator with tachometer feedback from motor winding - there
     would be 4 wires instead of two coming out of the motor - 2 for power
     and 2 for tach. Control circuitry could be bad or the tach output could
     be dead (speed too high).

  4. If an optical strobe disk is located on the motor shaft, then it may be
     part of a speed control circuit. If it is on one of the reels - probably
     the takeup reel - then it simply operates the (electronic) tape counter
     or signals the controller that the takeup reel is turning - to catch
     tape spills.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.12 "Tape speed adjustment made easy"

OK, you have found the magic screw, but how to set the speed accurately?
Sometimes, there will be strobe disks on tape decks which will appear
stationary under fluorescent lighting (magnetic ballasts only - electronic
ballasts are usually high frequency and do not modulate the light intensity
at the power line frequency) but not usually. So, you do it by ear:

Make a recording of a single tone on a tape recorder you trust - one with
accurate speed.

Suitable sources include: a signal generator, electronic instrument,
Touch-Tone phone tone, PC sound card output or PC speaker, etc. A frequency
around 400-1000 Hz should work well.

Then, adjust the speed while listening to this same source simultaneously
with the tape being played back on the unit to be adjusted. As you adjust the
speed, you will hear the pitch change. As it approaches the correct setting,
you will hear the tones beat against each other. When you are set correctly,
the pitches will be equal and the beat frequency will go to zero. Even if you
are tone deaf, you will easily be able to adjust pitch accuracy to better
than 1/10 of a semitone using this method.

@node 4.13 "Sudden increase in flutter on tape decks or Walkmen"

If your prized Walkman suddenly develops a severe case of warbling sound
check:

  1. Batteries (where appropriate). Almost dead batteries will greatly
     increase flutter. Use of Nickel-Cadmium rechargeable batteries in place
     of alkalines may result in problems due to their lower voltage (1.2 V
     vs, 1.5 V per cell).

  2. Tired belts - loose flabby deteriorated belts will produce varying,
     probably slow, speed as well.

  3. Dirt or goo on pulleys. Sometimes a glob of stuff gets stuck to a pulley
     and produces a periodic variation in speed. I picked one up at a garage
     sale that had this problem. I thought it was a bad motor until a careful
     examination revealed that the belt was jumping a mm or so on each
     rotation of an idler pulley.

  4. Lack of lubrication - a dry or worn bearing may result in a variety of
     speed problems.

  5. Bad speed regulator - either mechanical or electronic including bad
     solder connections or cracks in circuit board traces.

  6. Bad power supply.

  7. Bad tape. Don't overlook this obvious possibility, try another one.

@node 5.1 "Turntable (record changer) maintenance"

Here are general comments on oiling dinosaurs, oops sorry, turntables.

Usually there is a 'C-clip' or 'E-clip' which holds the platter (the thing
that rotates) onto the spindle. It may be covered with a decorative piece
which can be easily removed. The clip can be pryed off (gently) with a small
screwdriver (just don't lose it, though even this is not a biggie so long as
you never turn the thing up-side-down).

The platter can then be lifted straight up and off the spindle. You will see
several things (this will vary depending on your particular unit):

  1. A flat washer, sitting on a ball bearing race sitting on another flat
     washer (one or both of these washers may be missing. Also, the top one
     may stick to the platter when it is removed.) The ball bearings, shaft,
     washers, etc. should all be cleaned with degreaser and then lubed with a
     light grease. If either the steel balls or the flat washers are
     corroded, replacement will be necessary or else there will be terrible
     audible rumble. For now, it will at least work well enough to determine
     what else, if anything, needs attention. Also clean and lubricate the
     platter bushing (center hole) and shaft (vertical post on which it
     rotates).

  2. Changer gears etc. These will have varying amounts of grease on them if
     it is not gummed up, leave them alone. Put a drop or two of light oil on
     the shafts. Inspect other linkages as well. If the grease is gummed up
     on the gears or sliding linkages, you will need to clean it off
     thoroughly with degreaser and then use a small amount of high quality
     grease suitable for delicate mechanisms. One cause of a changer failing
     to activate at the end of a record is gummed up grease.

  3. Motor. Check to see if the motor shaft turns freely and smoothly even if
     spun quickly between your fingers. If it does - without squealing, don't
     do anything else. If it is tight or makes noise, then you will need to
     carefully disassemble the motor and clean and lubricate the bearings at
     each end with light oil. Don't lose any of the various washers/spacers
     that may be present on the shaft as it is removed from the end pieces
     and make sure to lubricate and return them to exactly the location and
     the same order they were in originally.

  4. Clean the rubber parts with isopropyl alcohol and Q-tips or a lint free
     cloth until no more black stuff comes off and then dry thoroughly. Now,
     inspect the belts (if any). If belts are flabby or cracked or if they
     don't instantly return to their relaxed length if stretched 25% and
     released, they will need replacing. Check the idler tire (if present).
     If hard or cracked, it will need replacing as well.

NOTE: Light oil here means electric motor oil or even 3-In-One but NOT WD40.
Light grease means something that is suitable for fine mechanisms and is safe
for plastics. Automotive bearing grease may not qualify.

@node 5.2 "Speed control in turntables"

Most inexpensive turntables/changers will use a synchronous motor or even
just an induction motor. The only maintenance for the motor is cleaning and
lubrication.

Servo controlled turntables utilize a feedback technique which locks the
platter speed to a stable reference - either the power line (50/60 Hz) or
more commonly a crystal oscillator. Here is one example:

A Sony turntable I repaired used a magnetic stripe pattern on the inside of
the platter which was sensed by a magnetic pickup. The resulting signal was
phase locked to a stable reference and used to control a brushless DC direct
drive motor. Speed would become erratic if (1) the magnetic pattern were
damaged, (2) the pickup position was moved too far from the surface of the
platter, (3) the Hall-effect sensors in the motor were bad, or (4) the
control electronics went bad. In one case, it turned out that one of the Hall
effect sensors had failed in the motor. This required disassembling the motor
and replacing the sensor - $4 from Sony.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.3 "Wow, flutter, and rumble in a turntable"

Wow and flutter refer to undesirable periodic variations in pitch caused by
changes in turntable (or tape deck) speed. Wow would be a slow variation
(e.g., once per rotation) while flutter would be rapid (e.g., a motor pulley
with a bump). Even if very slight, these faults will be all too obvious with
music but may go undetected at much higher levels for voice recordings.

Rumble is a very low frequency noise added to the audio caused by vibration
due to cheap, worn, dirty, or dry spindle bearings or by vibrations coupled
in from some other motor driven component or even from loudspeakers if the
volume is turned way up. If really bad, rumble may sound like a freight train
in the next room.

For anyone only used to listening to CDs, even very small amounts of and of
these will prove very obvious and extremely objectionable. Wow, flutter, and
rumble are undetectable - for all intents and purposes nonexistent - with
even the cheapest junkiest CD player.

For a common motor driven turntable, the following are likely causes:

  1. Bad belt or idler. Rubber 'rusts'. If it is old, then almost certainly
     the rubber parts have deteriorated and will need replacement.
     Unfortunately, replacement parts are not as readily available as they
     once were. The places listed at the end of this document may have some
     and there are many other sources but it is not as easy as one would
     like.

  2. Dirty or worn spindle bearing. This will cause rumble. The thrust ball
     bearing can be cleaned and lubricated or replaced. The platter bushing
     can be cleaned and lubricated.

  3. Lump of crud stuck to motor pulley or idler, usually of unknown origin.

  4. Dried up lubrication in motor, idler, or other rotating part. These can
     be cleaned and lubricated.

  5. Bad motor (not that likely) except for lubrication in which case the
     motor can be disassembled, cleaned, and lubed.

  6. Physical damage to platter - something heavy was dropped on it upsetting
     the delicate balance.

If you are attempting to restore a 20 year old turntable from Aunt Annie's
attic, don't even bother to power it up before replacing all the rubber parts
and cleaning and lubricating the motor, idler, and spindle bearing.

@endnode
@node 5.4 "Erratic sound from turntable"

Sound that varies randomly in intensity or where one channel drops out will
usually be due to bad connections in the various units. This could be:

  1. At the pickup itself. There may be small press fit connectors at the
     cartridge. These sometimes become loose. Gently remove each one (one at
     a time! so that you do not mix up the wiring) and squeeze with a pair of
     tweezers or needlenose pliers. Snap in cartridges may have dirty
     contacts the springiness may have disappeared.

  2. At the RCA plugs under the turntable which connect to the tonearm.
     Depending on your design and problem, you may need to simply clean with
     contact cleaner or squeeze the metal shell or center contact.

  3. At the receiver, preamp, or amplifier. Same as (2) above.

  4. Sometimes the cables themselves will develop broken wires at one end or
     the other. Easiest is to try a different set of cables.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.5 "Turntable tracking and skating force adjustment"

Tracking force keeps the stylus in the record's groove. Too little is as bad
as too much. It is best to follow the recommendations of the cartridge/stylus
manufacturer. If you do not have this information, start low and increase
until you eliminate skipping or excessive distortion, buzzing, or stuttering.
If too low, the stylus will make only partial contact with the groove during
high amplitude segments - it will jump from peak to peak (or other portion)
of the wave rather than smoothly and continuously following it. If too high,
it will gouge the vinyl (or the shellac or whatever depending on the vintage
of your records) or in extreme cases, bottom out on the cartridge's
suspension.

Skating force compensation is applied to compensate for the fact that except
at one distance from the spindle (or with a linear drive tone arm where this
does not apply), the tone arm is not tangential to the groove. Imagine a
perfectly flat record without any grooves. If you 'play' this, the tone arm
will be stable at only one position somewhere in the middle - where a line
drawn through its pivot point and the stylus is just tangential to a circle
at that distance from the spindle. The skating is usually a simple spring
which attempts to compensate for this in such a way that the side force
tending to move the stylus is minimized at all positions. Otherwise, the
inner and outer walls of the groove will experience a different force which
will add distortion and affect stereo separate and balance.

Skating force compensation is usually set based on the tracking force.

Note that if you are used to CDs or high quality cassettes, all the horrors
of records will be all to obvious unless you are using high-end equipment
(the kind that likely costs as much as your automobile) and meticulously
maintain your vinyl record collection. Sonic defects like wow, flutter,
rumble, distortion, noise, imperfect stereo separation, skipping, and limited
frequency response are all facts of life for this technology which has not
changed in any fundamental way since Edison's time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1 "Loudspeaker anatomy"

In this document, we use the terms 'loudspeaker' or 'speaker system' to
denote a unit consisting of one or more drivers in an acoustic enclosure
perhaps along with a frequency selective crossover, tone controls and
switches, fuses or circuit breakers. Connections to the amplifier or receiver
are via terminals on the rear. The front is covered with an (optically)
opaque or semitransparent grille which provides protection and improves the
appearance (depending on your point of view).

A 'driver' is the actual unit that converts electrical energy into sound
energy. Most drivers use voice coil technology: a very low mass coil wound on
a light rigid tube is suspended within a powerful magnetic field and attached
to a paper, plastic, or composite cone. The audio signal causes the coil to
move back and forth and this motion causes the cone to move which causes the
air to move which we perceive as sound.

The typical driver consists of several parts:

   o Frame - a rigid steel or composite structure on which the driver is
     constructed. The frame holds the magnet and core, cone suspension, and
     connection terminals.

   o Magnet - this includes a powerful (usually ceramic, AlNiCo, or rare
     earth) magnet including a core structure provide a very narrow
     cylindrical air gap. This accounts for most of the mass of a driver.

   o Voice coil - a one or two layer coil of fine wire wound on a light rigid
     cardboard, plastic, or composite tube suspended within the air gap of
     the magnet and connected via flexible wires to the electrical terminals.

   o Cone - a roughly cone shaped very light and rigid structure that does
     the actual work of moving air molecules. The cone in a woofer may be 12
     or more inches across. The cone in a tweeter may only be an inch in
     diameter. This is the part of the driver you actually see from the front
     of the speaker system with the grille removed. The center is usually
     protected with a small plastic dome.

   o Suspension - a corrugated flexible mounting for the voice coil called a
     'spider' and outer ring of very soft plastic or foam. Together, these
     allow the voice coil/cone combination to move readily in and out as a
     unit without tilting or or rubbing. For most designs, there is a certain
     amount of springiness to this suspension. Acoustic suspension
     loudspeaker, however, use the trapped air in a totally sealed speaker
     enclosure to provide the restoring force.

Inexpensive 'LoFi' devices like portable and clock radios, many TVs,
intercoms, and so forth use a single, cheap driver. Some have a coaxial pair
of cones but this does little to improve the frequency response.

HiFi speakers systems will divide the audio frequency spectrum into several
bands and use drivers optimized for each. The reason is that it is not
possible to design a single driver that has a uniform response for the entire
audio frequency spectrum. A 'woofer' is large and massive and handles the low
base notes. A 'tweeter' has a very low mass structure and is used for the
high frequencies. A 'mid-range' handles the mid frequencies. There may also
be 'sub-woofers' for the very very low notes that we feel more than hear.
Some systems may include 'super-tweeters' for the very highest frequencies
(which few people can hear. This may make for some impressive specifications
but perhaps little else.)

A 'crossover' network - a set of inductors and capacitors - implements a set
of filters to direct the electrical signal (mostly) to the proper drivers.

Various controls or switches may be provided to allow for the adjustment of
low, mid, and high frequency response to match the room acoustics more
faithfully or to taste. Fuses or circuit breakers may be included to protect
the speaker system from intentional (high volume levels) or accidental
(amplifier output stage blows) abuse.

@endnode
@node 6.2 "Loudspeaker problems"

If you have a high quality and expensive set of loudspeaker, then the cost of
professional repair may be justified. However, if the problem is with speaker
systems you might not write home about, then read on.

Playing your music system at very high volume levels, especially CDs which
may have peaks that way exceed the ratings of your loudspeakers is asking for
trouble - but you knew that! CDs can be deceiving because the noise floor is
so low that you are tempted to turn up the volume. A peak comes along and
your speaker cones are clear across the county (remember the movie 'Back to
the Future'?). Loudspeaker systems are generally pretty robust but continuous
abuse can take its toll.

Problems with loudspeakers:

  1. An entire speaker system is dead.

     Verify that the connections both at the speaker system and at the source
     are secure. Check circuit breakers or fuses in the speaker system. Reset
     or replace as needed. Make sure it is not the amplifier or other source
     that is defective by swapping channels if that is possible.
     Alternatively, test for output using a speaker from another system or
     even a set of headphones (but keep the volume turned way down). Assuming
     that these tests confirm that the speaker system is indeed not
     responding, you will need to get inside.

     It would take quite a blast of power to kill an entire speaker system.
     Therefore, it is likely that there is a simple bad connection inside,
     perhaps right at the terminal block. You should be able to easily trace
     the circuitry - this is not a missile guidance system after all - to
     locate the bad connection. If nothing is found, then proceed to test the
     individual drivers as outlined below.
  2. One or more drivers (the name for the individual speakers in a
     loudspeaker enclosure) is dead - no sound at all even when you place you
     ear right up to it. The cause may be a bad driver, a bad component or
     bad connection in the crossover network. Test these components as
     outlined below.

  3. One or more drivers produces distorted or weak sound. Distorted may mean
     fuzzy, buzzing, or scratchy a various volume levels. Most likely this is
     due to a bad driver but it could also be a defective component in the
     crossover - a capacitor for example or even a marginal connection.

Getting inside a speaker system usually means removing the decorative grille
if it snaps off or unscrewing the backpanel and/or terminal block. Use your
judgement. With the grille removed, you will be able to unscrew the
individual drivers one at a time. With the back off, you will have access to
all the internal components. If sealing putty is used, don't lose it or
expect to obtain some replacement putty (non-hardening window caulking like
Mortite is suitable).

Test the components in the crossover network with a multimeter. These are
simple parts like capacitors, inductors, and potentiometers or reostats.
Confirm that any circuit breakers or fuse holders have continuity.

Test the drivers on the low ohms scale of your multimeter. Disconnect one
wire so that the crossover components will not influence the reading. Woofers
and midrange drivers should measure a few ohms. If their impedance is marked,
the reading you get will probably be somewhat lower but not 0. If possible
compare your readings with the same driver in the good speaker system (if
this is a stereo setup). Some tweeters (very small high frequency drivers)
may have a series capacitor built in which will result in an infinite ohms
measurement. Other than these, a high reading indicates an open voice coil
which means a bad driver. In a comparison with an identical unit, a very low
reading would mean a partially or totally shorted voice coil, again meaning a
bad driver. Except for expensive systems with removable voice coil
assemblies, either of these usually mean that a replacement will be required
for the entire driver. Sometimes an open voice coil can be repaired if the
break can be found.

To confirm these tests, use an audio source to power just the suspect driver.
Your stereo system, a small amplifier attached to an audio source, or even a
pocket radio (use its speaker output if the headphone output does not have
enough power) will suffice. The resulting sound will not be of high quality
because you do not have the enclosure sealed and it is only one of the
drivers in the system, but it should give you some idea of its condition.
Again, comparing with an identical unit would be another confirmation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.3 "Repairing loudspeaker drivers"

As noted above, if you are dealing with a high quality system, leave these
repairs to professionals or obtain an entire replacement as some reduction in
audio quality may result from the abuse you are about to inflict on the poor
defenseless driver.

We will address two types of repairs: physical damage to a speaker driver
cone and an open voice coil (actually, wiring outside the voice coil).
However, serious damage to the cone or just plain deterioration of the
suspension components may require replacement of the entire driver unless a
close enough match can be found.

Various sizes of paper cones and foam-edge replacements are available from
MAT Electronics @ 1-800-628-1118. I just got their Spring 96 catalog and
these are new products. They range in price from less than a dollar to about
$5 for the largest (15") drivers. The downside is there is a $25 minimum.
However, they also sell electronic components like flybacks, video heads and
belts, ICs and transistors, etc. So coming up with a minimum order may not be
too difficult. (Raymond Carlsen (rrcc@u.washington.edu))

Minor damage to the cone can be repaired using a flexible adhesive like
weatherstrip cement and a piece of thick paper to reinforce the seam or hole
if necessary. Since this will not totally perfect match with the original
paper cone, there could be audible distortion at certain frequencies
particularly at higher volume levels. However, such a repair will be better
than nothing. Cut the paper in a shape and size to just overlap both sides of
the torn area or completely cover the puncture. Use just the smallest amount
of adhesive to fasten your 'splint' to the cone. The less material you add,
the more likely that the audio effects will be minimal.

An open driver can sometimes be rescued by tracing the input wires through
the cone and under the center protective dome. The most likely places for
these wires to break are right at the place where they pass through the cone
and just after they pass under the dome. NOTE: some drivers have replaceable
voice coil units. If this is the case, you should probably just replace the
entire unit.

First, scrape away the insulating varnish on the front of the cone where the
wires emerge and head toward the center. Use your ohmmeter to test for
continuity here. If you find that you now are measuring a reasonable
resistance - a few ohms, then trace back to determine which of the two wires
is broken or has had the solder connection come loose. If it is still
infinite, you will have to go under the dome.

Use an Xacto knife to carefully remove the dome. Use a shallow angle and cut
as near the edge as you can. Take care not to puncture the paper cone which
may continue under the dome as the voice coil may be of a smaller diameter
than the dome. The shallow cut will also provide a base to reattach the dome
if you are successful. Carefully scrape off a bit of the enamel insulation as
near to the voice coil as possible and test with your ohmmeter once again. If
the resistance is still infinite, there is nothing more you can do but
salvage the magnet for fun experiments or erasing floppy disks. There is
essentially no way to replace just the voice coil unless your driver has a
removable voice coil unit (in which case you would not be reading this).

If the resistance now measures normal - a few ohms, trace back to determine
which wire is broken and use some fine (e.g., #30 gauge) wire to bridge the
break. You will have to scrape off the enamel insulation to permit the solder
to adhere. Make sure it is secure mechanically first - a speaker cone is a
rather violent environment for soldered connections. Finally, use some
flexible adhesive to protect and reinforce the solder connections, to glue
down your new wire along its entire length, to protect and reinforce the
place where the wire passes through the cone, and finally, to reattach the
central dome. Let the adhesive dry thoroughly before playing the 1812
Overture.

@node 6.4 "Loudspeakers - repair or replace?"

Assuming that the cabinet is in reasonable condition, the question arises: is
it worth replacing broken, damaged, or worn out drivers or faulty crossover
components that are not repairable rather than just dumping the speaker
systems?

It is very straightforward to swap drivers as long as you get ones with
similar characteristics. It all depends on what you want out of a
loudspeaker. If you are basically happy with them, then it will be a lot
cheaper than replacing the entire speaker system(s). However, speaker system
quality has improved considerably in the last 15 years so now may be the time
to upgrade.

As far as crossover components are concerned, these are basically common
electronic parts and replacement is probably worthwhile.

However, if one driver has a deteriorated suspension, it is likely that its
mate does as well and that other drivers may not far behind. Replacing ALL
the internal components of a loudspeaker may not be worth it.

Radio Shack as well as places like MCM Electronics and Dalbani have a variety
of replacement drivers, and crossovers and parts.

@node 7.1 "Answering machine comments"

Most answering machines still use one or two tape decks. Most problems are
mechanical. Refer to the sections on the relevant @{"tape player/recorder" link "4"}
problems. The newest ones are fully digital electronic - forget repairs
unless obvious bad connections, physical damage, power supply, or phone line
side failure.

Many non-mechanical problems with answering machines are related to the
circuitry connected to the phone line. This is subject to the high on-hook
and ringing voltage and possible voltage spikes due to lightening, etc.

Testing of the components on the phone line side of the coupling transformer
is a worthwhile exercise and may reveal a shorted semiconductor or capacitor.

With endless loops outgoing message cassettes, the metal strip that is used
to sense the beginning can wear or become dirty. Try a new cassette or clean
it.

Mechanical problems unique to answering machine tape transports are also
possible. Some very clever engineering is often used to share parts where two
tape transports are used. Parts may have popped off or broken. Springs may
have sprung. Sliding parts may have jammed. Look for loose parts or broken
pieces when the unit is disassembled. Careful inspection during operation may
reveal whether it is getting stuck due to a mechanical failure

@node 7.2 "Answering machine picks up then hangs up"

  1. If it has a 'telco' and a 'phone' connector verify that you are plugged
     into the 'telco'. Otherwise, it may hang itself up. Who knows. If
     someone else attempted a repair, these jacks could even have been
     replaced interchanged.

  2. Measure voltage on the relay coil. If it actually disappears when the
     relay cuts out, then something is telling the relay to turn off. If it
     is just reduced, then there may be a power problem. If it is relatively
     stable, then the relay may be bad.

  3. Test components near the telephone connection for shorts/opens. Parts
     connected to the telephone line get abused by the ringing voltage and
     other transients. Maybe you will get lucky and find a fried part.

  4. If you can identify the power supply outputs, verify their voltages if
     possible. Check the 'wall wart' if it uses one for proper output.

  5. Make sure that the tape mechanisms have completed their cycles. While
     unlikely, it is possible that the logic gets confused if one of the tape
     units has not reset itself due to a mechanical fault like a bad belt.

  6. As usual with cheaply made consumer stuff (as well as cheaply made
     expensive industrial stuff), check for bad connections.

Beyond this, circuit diagrams would be a definite plus.

@node 7.3 "Answering machine does not complete cycle"

This is often a mechanical problem. As it goes through the cycle, see if the
mechanism is perhaps getting hung up at a certain point do to a weak spring
or motor. A cam may get stuck or a solenoid may fail to engage. Gently
prodding the uncooperative part (or any likely parts if the appropriate one
is not obvious) may convince it to continue and allow you to make a
diagnosis.

For endless loop outgoing cassettes make sure that the metal sense strip is
not worn off and that the sensor is making good contact. Try a new outgoing
message cassette or manually short the sensor contacts to see if it will then
shut down.

@endnode
@node 7.4 "Answering machine has weak outgoing message"

You probably have no way of knowing since you probably never listen to the
outgoing message, but did the problem happen suddenly?

Does playback of the outgoing message directly to the speaker appear to be at
normal volume?

Do incoming messaged get recorded at normal volume?

First, confirm that the unit is in good mechanical condition. See the
section: @{"General guide to tape deck cleaning and rubber parts replacement" link "4.2"}
Clean the tape head and inspect for anything that may be interfering with
good tape-head contact. Clean the internal record/play selector switches.
Dirty contacts can result in any number of symptoms.

Assuming that none of this helps significantly, you are left with a problem
in the electronics.

If local record and playback of the the outgoing message works normally, the
problem is not a bad tape head. It is probably in the interface to the phone
line.

If local record and/or playback do not work correctly, then there are likely
problems with that circuitry.

One other slight possibility is that you have so much equipment (phones,
modems, fax machines, etc.) on the phone line that in your house that the
answering machine is not able to drive the line properly and reduced outgoing
message volume is the result.

If a Touch Tone phone that was previously working now does not tone dial from

other functions are unaffected), the red and green wires are probably
interchanged at the new jack, or the phone itself is miswired (the wires
inside the phone may have been interchanged to compensate for an incorrectly

Newer electronic phones will utilize either polarity. The older ATT
battlewagons will only dial when hooked up with the correct polarity. This

@node 7.6 "Cordless phone problems"

There are several types of problems with cordless phones that can be
diagnosed and repaired without sophisticated test equipment. Anything
involving problems with the RF or digital circuitry is not likely to be
within the scope of your capabilities, at least not without complete
schematics (yeh, right), test equipment, and a miracle or two.

  1. Bad rechargeable battery - dead, shorted cell(s), or reduced capacity.
     The NiCd battery packs in cordless phones are usually easily replaced
     for around $5-10. This really is the best solution. The problem is
     almost never in the charging circuits. Replacing individual cells is not
     recommended. Battery packs can be built up from individual NiCd cells
     with solder tabs for a modest cost savings. Reuse the old battery pack
     connector (you may need to do this with a replacement pack as well if
     the new connector is not identical to the old one), double check
     polarity, and tape and insulate your homemade pack after soldering to
     prevent shorts.

     A NiCd battery pack with shorted cells will either prevent operation
     totally or keep the 'battery low' light resulting in a weak, noisy, or
     intermittent connection. If the voltage measured on the battery pack
     after 24 hours of charging is less than 1.2 V times the number of cells
     in the pack, it is most likely bad.

  2. Dirty keypad - resulting in intermittent, incorrect, or no operation of
     buttons on handset. This may be due to internal migration of some
     unidentified substance (how else to describe disgusting sticky gunk that
     has no right being there on multiple samples of the same model phone) or
     from external spills. If you are lucky, the keypad can be disassembled
     without resorting to drastic measures. There may be screws or it may
     snap apart once access is gained to the inside of the handset. Clean
     contact surfaces on both the rubber button panel (or plastic keys) and
     the circuit board first with soap and water and then with isopropyl
     alcohol. Dry thoroughly. If the keypad is assembled with 'upset' plastic
     (fancy term for little melted plastic posts), then you should probably
     try contact cleaner sprayed as best as possible through any openings
     before attempting to cut these away since reassembling the keypad
     without the plastic posts will be difficult (read: impossible).

  3. Bad AC adapter on base station - see the sections on @{"AC adapters" link "10"}

  4. Bad phone line connection - don't ignore this possibility - test with
     another phone.

  5. Bad circuitry on phone line side of interface (coupling transformer) -
     inspect for blown or shorted components.

  6. Bad connections or broken circuit board - if the handset has seen
     violent service, these are likely possibilities. See the section on:
     @{"Equipment dropped or abused" link "14.7"}

  7. You forgot the code number - some phones use a multidigit code number as
     a marginal security feature which must match on handset and base
     station. If the battery goes dead in the handset or the AC adapter is
     pulled on the base station, this code may be forgotten. You do have the
     user's manual, right? (BTW, do set this code to a non-default value. I
     was once able to dial out on my neighbor's cordless phone using my phone
     from my house as a result, I suspect, of their phone being set to its
     default code!)

@node 7.7 "Checking phones and answering machines for electronic problems"

Most signal problems will be related to failed components on the telephone
line side of the coupling transformer including components in the phone line
derived power supply (if used). Phone lines are subject to all kinds of abuse
including lightening strikes (although something significant may do extensive
damage beyond reasonably hope of repair).

Test all the components on the telephone line side of the coupling
transformer when line connect, detect, or dial problems are encountered.
There may be shorted semiconductors due to a voltage spike or just bad luck.

Some units extract power from the phone line and the rectifiers or other
related components can go bad. This can result in either power problems -
telephone is dead - or dialing problems.

Make sure you are using the proper AC adapter and test it for correct output.

There could be a defective power supply inside the phone - the regulator
could be shorted or a filter capacitor could be dried up. See the sections on
@{"power supply" link "11"} problems.

Check for loose or broken connections - phones get dropped.

For erratic dialing problems, inspect and clean the keypad and other switch
contacts. Also see the section: @{"Cordless phone problems" link "7.6"}

@endnode
@node 7.8 "Modem problems"

First, confirm that your modem settings are correct - reset the modem to
factory defaults using the Hayes AT commands (e.g., AT&F1<ENTER>) or dip
switch settings. Confirm that your software is set up correctly and that
there are no IRQ or IO address conflicts.

If the modem starts to dial but aborts and hangs up, confirm that you do not
have the wiring of the 'telco' and 'phone' connectors interchanges.

Most actual problems (that are not software related), will be on the phone
line side of the coupling transformer. There will be various diodes,
transistors, capacitors, opto-isolators, and relays for routing the incoming
and outgoing signals, or for protection and these can fail. This phone line
is subject to all kinds of abuse.

A lightening strike is likely to obliterate components in the modem beyond
even your abilities to salvage it. However, in many cases, damage is minor.

If you have signal problems - a modem will try to dial out but not make its
way to the phone line, testing on each side of the couping transformer with a
scope or Hi-Z headphones should be able to determine if the problem is on the
logic or phone line side of the device.

Check that the proper AC adapter is being used (if relevant) and that is is
putting out the proper voltage. Check the internal power supply components
for proper output. They are often common IC regulators like the 7805 and are
easily tested. Replacements are inexpensive and plentiful.

@node 8.1 "Problems with calculators"

Small hand held and desk calculators share many of the same afflictions as
hand held IR remote controls. In particular, battery and keypad problems are
common.

CAUTION: many devices using LCD displays utilize a printed flex cable to
interconnect the electronics and the display. Often, this is simply glued to
the LCD panel and possibly to the logic board as well. The cables are quite
fragile and easily torn. They are also easily ripped from the adhesive on the
LCD panel or logic board. If the unit is fairly old, this adhesive may be
very weak and brittle. Repair or replacement should this occur is virtually
impossible. The material used for the conductors is a type of conductive
paint that cannot be soldered. It may be possible to use a similar material
like the conductive Epoxy used to repair printed circuit boards but this
would be extremely tedious painstaking work. Be extremely careful when moving
any of the internal components - LCD, logic board, keyboard, battery
holder/pack, and printer.

The following problems are likely:

  1. Batteries - one or more cells are dead, weak, or have leaked. Try a new
     set if normal primary cells (e.g., alkaline) are used. Clean the battery
     contacts. Where rechargeable (usually NiCd) batteries are used, one or
     more cells may have shorted resulting in a dead calculator or dim
     display, or printer that doesn't work reliably. See the sections on
     @{"batteries" link "12"}. Test each cell after charging for the recommended time or
     overnight. NiCd cells should be about 1.2 V when fully charged. If any
     are 0 V, the cell is shorted. This is particularly likely with a unit
     that has been left in a closet unused for an extended period of time. It
     is generally recommended that the entire battery pack be replaced rather
     than a single cell as the others are probably on their way out and the
     capacities will not be equalized anyhow. Rechargeable batteries may be
     the cause of a calculator that does not work properly on AC power as
     well since they are usually used like a large filter capacitor and
     shorted cells will prevent the required DC voltage from being provided
     to the electronics. Open cells or bad battery connections will prevent
     this filtering as well and may result in erratic operation or other
     symptoms. For this reason, it may not be possible to run a unit of this
     type reliably or at all with the rechargeable batteries removed.

     Some calculators that use rechargeable batteries like older HPs and TIs
     have a battery pack of 24.4 to 3.6 V with a DC-DC invertor to obtain the
     9 V or so that the NMOS chipset required. These rarely fail except
     possibly due to leakage of neglected dead batteries. However, good
     batteries need to be in place for the calculator to work properly. If
     you are not interested in using these types of calculators on batteries,
     disconnect the DC=DC convertor and substitute a suitable AC adapter.
     Check the voltage and current requirements for your particular model.

  2. Keypad - dirt, gunk, and wear may result in one or more keys that are
     intermittent or bounce (result in multiple entries). Disassemble, clean
     and restore the conductive coating if necessary. See the section (or
     companion document) on hand held @{"remote controls" link "14.12"}

  3. Printer (where applicable) - in addition to replacing the ribbon when
     the print quality deteriorates, cleaning and lubrication may be needed
     periodically. Dust, dirt, and paper particles collect and gum up the
     works. Clean and then relube with light machine oil or grease as
     appropriate. Sometimes, gears or other parts break resulting in erratic
     operation or paper or other jams. Locating service parts is virtually
     impossible.

  4. AC adapter - if the calculator does not work when plugged into the AC
     line, this may be defective - broken wires at either end of the cord are
     very common. However, shorted cells in an internal NiCd battery will
     likely prevent the proper voltage from being supplied to the electronics
     even when using AC power since the battery is often used like a large
     filter capacitor at the same time it is being charged. Open cells or bad
     connections to the battery pack may result in erratic operation or other
     symptoms as well.

     Don't overlook the obvious: are you using the proper adapter and if it
     is a universal type, is the polarity and voltage set correctly? Check
     the specifications. With the proliferation of AC adapters, it is all to
     easy to accidentally substitute one from another device.

@node 8.2 "Battery powered digital clock problems"

First, try a fresh battery and clean the battery contacts if necessary. If
the battery is very low or dead, well.... When the battery is low or the
connections are bad, the countdown logic may run erratically - fast as well
as slow. Give it a week and then see if the problem still exists.

If it does - and the error is only a few minutes a week - then an adjustment
may be all that is needed. If the error is much worse - like it is running at
half speed - then there is a problem in the logic - time for new clock (or at
least a new movement).

There should be a recessed screw for fine speed adjustment accessible from
the back - possibly after a sticker or outer cover is removed. It may be
marked with a couple of arrows and if you are lucky, with the proper
direction for speed increase and decrease.

Without test equipment, the best you can do is a trial and error approach.
Turn the screw just the tiniest bit in the appropriate direction. If this is
not marked, use counterclockwise to slow it down and vice-versa.

Wait a week, then readjust if necessary.

If you have frequency counter with a time period mode, you can try putting it
across the solenoid terminals and adjusting for exactly 1.000000 second.
Hopefully the load of the counter will not affect the oscillator frequency.

With sensitive equipment, it may even be possible to do this without any
connections by detecting the fundamental frequency radiation of the quartz
crystal oscillator and adjusting it for exactly 32,768 Hz (most common).

However, keep in mind that the clock's quartz crystal accuracy required to
gain or lose less than 1 minute a month is about +/- 1 part in 43,000 which
may be better than that of your frequency counter's timebase. One alternative
is to perform the same measurement on a clock that is known to be accurate
and then match the one you are adjusting to that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.3 "AC powered digital clock problems"

Common problems include totally dead, missing segments in display, running at
the wrong rate, switches or buttons do not work. (Also applies to the clock
portions of clock radios.)

Note that these is often a battery - possibly just an 9V alkaline type for
backup in the event of a power failure. If this is missing or dead, any
momentary power interruption will reset the clock.

Although a totally dead clock could be caused by a logic failure, the most
likely problem is in the power supply. The power transformer may have an open
winding or there may a bad connection elsewhere. A diode may be defective or
a capacitor may be dried up.

Often, the secondary of the power transformer is center tapped - test both
sides with a multimeter on its AC scale. Typical values are 6-15 VRMS. If
both sides are dead, then the primary is likely open. There may be a blown
fusable resistor under the coil wrappings but a burnt out primary is likely.
Although generic replacement transformers are available you will have two
problems: determining the exact voltage and current requirements (though
these are not usually critical) and obtaining a suitable regulatory (UL. CE,
etc) approved transformer - required for fire safety reasons.

If the transformer checks out, trace the circuit to locate the DC outputs.
These power supplies are usually pretty simple and it should be easy to
locate any problems.

Missing segments in the display are most likely caused by bad connections.
Try prodding and twisting the circuit board and inspect for cold solder
joints.

A clock that runs slow on 50 Hz power or fast on 60 Hz power may not be
compatible with the local line frequency since these clocks usually use the
power line for timing rather than a quartz crystal. This is actually a more
precise (as well as less expensive) approach as the power line frequency long
term accuracy is nearly perfect. Sometimes there is a switch or jumper to
select the line frequency.

Dirty switches and buttons can be cleaned using a spray contact cleaner.

@endnode
@node 8.4 "Replacing batteries in digital watches"

About the only type of service you can expect to perform is battery
replacement but even this can save a few dollars compared to taking the watch
to a jeweler. The typical watch battery will last anywhere from a year
(alkaline) to 5 years (lithium). The most likely cause of a watch that has a
dead or weak display, or has stopped or is not keeping proper time is a weak
or dead battery.

The batteries (actually single cells) used in most modern watches (they used
to be called electric watches, remember the Accutron?) are either alkaline or
lithium button cells. Some are quite tiny. You will need to open up the watch
to identify the type so that a replacement can be obtained.

How you go about doing this will depend on the watch:

  1. Screws. If there are visible screws on either the front or rear, then
     removing these will probably enable the cover to be popped off. These
     will be teeny tiny star (sort of Philips) head type - use a precision
     jeweler's screwdriver with a Philips head tip. Immediately put the
     screws into a pill bottle or film canister - they seem to evaporate on
     their own.

  2. Snap off back. This is probably most common. Look for an indentation
     around the edge. Using a penknife or other similar relatively sharp
     edged tool in this indentation or at any convenient spot if there is
     none. It is best to use the wristband mounting rod as a lever fulcrum if
     possible. The back should pop off. Note the orientation of the back
     before you set it aside so that you can get it back the same way.

  3. Cover unscrews. The entire back may be mounted in a screw thread around
     its edge in which case you will have to somehow grab the entire back and
     rotate counter clockwise. An adjustable wrench with some tape to protect
     the finish on the watch may work.

If there is an O-ring seal (like on the space shuttle), be careful not to
nick or otherwise damage it (you know what happens when these are damaged!).

Once the back is off, you will see a lot of precision stuff - though not
nearly as much as in an old fashioned mechanical watch. DON'T TOUCH! You are
interested in only one thing - the battery. Sometimes, once the back is off,
the button cell will simply drop out as there is no other fastener. In other
cases, one or two more teeny tiny screws will hold it in places. Carefully
remove these and the button cell. Replace the screws so you will not loose
them. Make a note of the orientation of the button cell - it is almost always
smooth side out but perhaps not in every case.

Test the battery with a multimeter. The voltage of a fresh battery will be
about 1.5 V for an alkaline cell and as high as 3 V for a lithium cell. A
watch will typically still work with a battery that has gone down to as
little as half its rated voltage.

Replacement batteries can be obtained from Radio Shack, some supermarkets,
large drug outlets, electronic distributors, or mail order parts suppliers.
Most likely, you will need to cross reference the teeny tiny markings on the
old battery - places that sell batteries usually have a replacement guide.

Cost should be about $2.00 for a typical alkaline cell and slightly more for
the longer lived lithium variety.

NOTE: some watches bury the battery inside the works requiring further
disassembly. This is usually straightforward but will require additional
steps and some added risk of totally screwing it up.

Install and secure the replacement battery and immediately confirm that the
display is alive or the second hand is moving. If it is not, double check
polarity. Sometimes, the back will need to be in place for proper contact to
be made.

fun.

Hand held light meters are subject to damage from being dropped.

Problems with internal light meters include bad batteries and corroded

@node 9.2 "Pocket camera repair"

It seems that in the last few years, the amount of circuitry crammed into a
compact 35 mm camera has grown exponentially. Auto-film-advance, auto-
exposure, auto-film speed detection and loading, auto focus, auto-flash
selection, auto-red-eye reduction - just about everything that could be put
under computer control has been. Next thing you know, the photographer will
be replaced with a auto-robot!

For the most part, modern cameras are very reliable. However, when something
goes wrong, it is virtually impossible to attempt repair for two reasons:

  1. The circuitry is so crammed into a tiny case that access is difficult
     and convoluted. Many connections are made with relatively fragile
     flexible printed cables and getting at certain parts means removing a
     whole bunch of other stuff.

  2. Much of the circuitry is surface mount and many custom parts are used.
     Schematics are nearly impossible to obtain and with all the computer
     control, probably not that useful in any case. Most parts are not
     available except from the manufacturer and then possibly only to
     authorized service centers.

However, some problems can be addressed without resorting to the camera
repair shop or dumpster.

If the camera is still under warranty, don't even think about attempting any
kind of repair unless it is just a bad battery. Almost certainly, evidence of
your efforts will be all too visible - mangled miniature screw heads and
damaged plastic seams - at the very least. There are no easy repair
solutions.  Let the professionals deal with it.

If out of warranty and/or you don't care about it and/or you want an excuse
to buy a new camera, then you may be able to fix certain (very limited) types
of problems.

@node 9.3 "Getting inside a pocket camera"

For anything beyond the battery, you will need to get inside. However, before
you expend a lot of effort on a hopeless cause consider that unless you see
something obvious - a broken connection, bent or dirty switch contact, or a
motor or other mechanical part that is stuck, binding, or in need of cleaning
and lubrication - there is not a lot you will likely be able to do. One
exception is with respect to the electronic flash which is usually relatively
self contained and simple enough to be successfully repaired without a
schematic.

As with other consumer electronics equipment, getting inside may be a
challenge worthy of Sherlock Holmes. In addition to many obvious very tiny
screws around the periphery, there may be hidden screws inside the battery
compartment and under the hand grip (carefully peel it back if that area is
the last holdout). Also see the section: 
@{"Getting inside consumer electronic equipment" link "3.5"}

This is the time to make careful notes and put all the tiny parts in storage
containers as soon as they are removed. If you never follow any of these
recommendations for other types of equipment, at least do so for pocket
cameras!

CAUTION: the energy storage capacitor for the electronic flash may be located
in an unexpected spot way on the other side of the camera. Accidentally
touching its terminals when charged will be unpleasant to say the least. Even
if the camera is 'off', some designs maintain this capacitor at full charge.
In addition, it may retain a painful charge for days - with the battery
removed. Once you get the skins off of the camera (if you ever succeed),
identify this capacitor - it will be about the size of a AA battery - and put
electrical tape over its terminals.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.4 "Pocket camera problems"

The following malfunctions may sometimes be successfully dealt with without
an army of camera repair technicians at your disposal:

CAUTION: never open the back of a 35 mm camera anywhere there is light of any
kind if there is a chance that there is film inside. If the camera is dead,
there may be no way of knowing. Doing this even for an instant may ruin all
of the film that has been exposed and two (usually) additional pictures.
Opening the back of any other kind of roll film camera will only expose a few
frames as the exposed film usually has a backing (120) or is inside a
cartridge (110).

If a 35 mm camera failed with a roll of film on which you have taken
irreplaceable photographs inside, the pictures can still be saved even if the
camera never works again. First, wash your hands thoroughly to remove skin
oils. Use a closet with a tightly fitting door (at night is better or stuff
something in any cracks to block all light - it must be pitch black) for a
darkroom. Open the back of the camera and carefully remove the film cassette.
Gently pull the exposed film from the takeup spool (on the shutter release
side of the camera). It should unwind easily. Avoid touching the film surface
itself with your fingers (the edges are ok). Then, turn the plastic shaft
sticking out of the film cassette clockwise to wind the exposed film entirely
into the cassette.

(For items (2)-(4), you will need to get inside of the camera. See the
section: @{"Getting inside a pocket camera" link "9.3"}

  1. General erratic or sluggish operation, weak display, camera pooped out
     during film advance or rewind. Most likely cause: the battery died.

     Test the battery and/or try a new one. It is possible that the battery
     simply decided to go flat at an inconvenient time or that a replacement
     was defective. If possible, check the voltage on the battery while it is
     in the camera and the affected operations are performed. If the voltage
     drops substantially, there could be an overload - a motor that is
     binding or a shorted component. If the camera had been dropped, a
     mechanical problem is likely.

  2. Flash inoperative or excess current drain - runs down batteries. Other
     functions may or may not work correctly. Most likely cause: a shorted
     invertor transistor. The electronic flash or strobe is usually a self
     contained module near the actual flash window but the energy storage
     capacitor may be mounted elsewhere - like the opposite side of the case.
     See the warning below - you could be in for a surprise!

  3. Mechanical problems with focus, exposure, film advance, or rewind.
     Likely causes: binding due to damage from being bumped or dropped, bad
     or erratic motor operation, gummed up lubrication or dirt, or defective
     driver or control logic. Locate the motor for each function (right, good
     luck) and confirm that they spin freely and move the appropriate gears,
     levers, cogs, wheels, or whatever. If there is any significant
     resistance to movement, attempt to determine if it is simply a
     lubrication problem or if something is stuck. Test the motors - see the
     section: @{"Small motors in consumer electronic equipment" link "13.1"}

  4. Auto-film-loading, film advance, or rewind do not operate at all or do
     not terminate. Most likely cause: defective motor or mechanical
     problems, dirty, corroded, or faulty sensor switches or bad controller.
     If there is no action or something seems to get stuck or sounds like it
     is struggling, check the battery and motor (see (1) and (3) above).
     Inspect the various microswitches for broken actuators, bent or deformed
     contacts, or something stuck in them like a bit of film that broke away
     from the roll. Dirt may be preventing a key contact closure. Sometimes,
     improper cable routing during manufacture can interfere with the free
     movement of a leaf type contact.

  5. Exposure too light or too dark. Check the film speed setting and/or
     clean the contact fingers under the cassette that sense the film (ASA or
     ISO) speed. Clean the light meter sensor. Check the batteries, Look for
     evidence of problems with the lens iris and/or shutter mechanism. If the
     shutter speed can be set manually, see the section: 
	 @{"Testing shutter speed" link "9.5"}

@endnode
@node 9.5 "Testing of camera shutter speed"

If you suspect shutter speed problems, there are several easy ways to measure
this for your camera. The most accurate require some test equipment but you
can get a pretty good idea with little or no equipment beyond a stopwatch
(for slow shutter speeds - above 1/2 to 1 second and a TV (for fast shutter
speeds - below about 1/60 of a second (NTSC 525/60).

Some of these approaches assume that you have access to the film plane of the
camera - this may be tough with many highly automated compact cameras which
will be unhappy unless a roll of film is properly loaded with the back door
closed.

Note that the behavior of focal plane and leaf (in-the-lens) shutters is
significantly different at high shutter speeds and this affects the the
interpretation of measurements.

Some simple homemade equipment will enable testing of the intermediate
shutter speeds.

  1. Testing slow to medium shutter speeds - the use of a stopwatch is self
     evident for really long times (greater than .5 second or so). However,
     viewing or photographing the sweep hand of a mechanical stop watch or a
     homemade motor driven rotating white spot or LED can provide quite
     accurate results. Accurate timing motors are inexpensive and readily
     available. Mount a black disk with a single small white spot at its edge
     on the motor shaft and mark some graduations around its perimeter on a
     stationary back board. For a high tech look, use an LED instead. Use
     your creativity.

     Making measurements from the photographic images of the arcs formed by
     the spot as it rotates while the shutter is open should result in
     accuracies better than 1 or 2% for shutter speeds comparable to or
     slower than the rotation frequency of the motor. In other words, shutter
     speeds down to 1/10th of a second for a 600 rpm (10 rps) motor or down
     to 1/60th of a second for a 3600 rpm (60 rps) motor.

     At these speeds, focal plane and leaf shutters should result in similar
     results since the open and close times are small compared to the total
     exposure time.

  2. Testing fast shutter speeds - view a TV (B/W is fine) screen on a piece
     of ground glass at the focal plane or take a series of snapshots of a TV
     screen (a well adjusted B/W TV is best as the individual scan lines will
     be visible).

     NOTE: If your camera has a focal plane shutter (e.g., 35 mm SLRs),
     orient the camera so that the shutter curtain travels across -
     horizontally (rather than up or down).

     If you are photographing the screen, take a few shots at each speed in
     case the timing of your trigger finger is not quite precise and you
     cross the vertical blanking period with some of them.

     For a focal plane shutter, you will see a bright diagonal bar. (The
     angle of the bar can be used to estimate the speed of the shutter
     curtain's traversal.)

     For a leaf (in-the-lens) shutter, you will see a bright horizontal bar.
     but the start and end of the exposure (top and bottom of the bar) will
     be somewhat fuzzy due to the non-zero time it takes to open and close
     the shutter leaves. You will have to estimate the locations of the 'full
     width half maximum' for each speed.

     In both cases, there will some additional smearing at the bottom of the
     bar due to the persistence of the CRT phosphors.

     The effective exposure time can then be calculated by multiplying the
     number of scan lines in the bar at any given horizontal position by 63.5
     uS (the NTSC horizontal scan time).

     If you cannot resolve individual scan lines, figure that a typical over-
     scanned (NTSC) TV screen has 420-440 visible lines. If you can adjust
     your TV (remember this can be an old B/W set when knobs were knobs!) for
     underscan, about 488 or so active video lines will be visible.

     If you have an oscilloscope or electronic counter/timer, fairly accurate
     measurements can be made at all shutter speeds using a bright light and
     a photodetector circuit.

  3. Using an electronic counter/timer or oscilloscope. Construct the IR
     detector described in the document: "Notes on the Repair of Hand Held
     Remote Controls" (Note that the fact that it is called an IR detector is
     irrelevant since the typical photodiode is sensitive to visible
     wavelengths of light as well.) Connect its output to your scope or
     counter. Put a diffuse light source (i.e., light bulb) close to the lens
     so that it is not in focus. Position the detector photodiode in the
     center of the focal plane - mount it on a little piece of cardboard that
     fits on the film guide rails. Using this setup, it should be a simple
     matter to measure the shutter timing.

     For a focal plane shutter, the time response will be the convolution of
     the photodetector area and the slit in the shutter curtain. The smaller
     the aperture of the photodiode, the less this will be a factor. Masking
     it with black tape may be desirable when testing fast shutter speeds. In
     simple terms, make the photodiode aperture narrow.

     For between-the-lens shutters, the finite open and close times of the
     leaves will show up on the oscilloscope in the rise and fall times of
     the trace. The measurement on the electronic timer will be affected by
     its trigger level setting for this reason. However, since this
     photodetector is not linearly calibrated, the open and close times
     cannot be accurately determined from the waveform.

@node 9.6 "Electronic flash fundamentals"

All modern electronic flash units (often called photographic strobes) are
based on the same principles of operation whether of the subminiature variety
in a disposable pocket camers or high quality 35 mm camera, compact separate
hot shoe mounted unit, or the high power high performance unit found in a
photo studio 'speed light'. All of these use the triggered discharge of an
energy storage capacitor through a special flash tube filled with Xenon gas
at low pressure to produce a very short burst of high intensity white light.

The typical electronic flash consists of four parts: (1) power supply, (2)
energy storage capacitor, (3) trigger circuit, and (4) flash tube.

An electronic flash works as follows:

  1. The energy storage capacitor connected across the flash tube is charged
     from a 300V (typical) power supply. This is either a battery or AC
     adapter operated invertor (pocket cameras and compact strobes) or an AC
     line operated supply using a power transformer or voltage doubler or
     tripler (high performance studio 'speed' lights). These are large
     electrolytic capacitors (200-1000+ uF at 300+ V) designed specifically
     for the rapid discharge needs of photoflash applications.

  2. A 'ready light' indicates when the capacitor is fully charged. Most
     monitor the voltage on the energy storage capacitor. However, some
     detect that the invertor or power supply load has decreased indicating
     full charge.

  3. Normally, the flash tube remains non-conductive even when the capacitor
     is fully charged.

  4. A separate small capacitor (e.g., .1 uF) is charged from the same power
     supply to generate a trigger pulse.

  5. Contacts on the camera's shutter close at the instant the shutter is
     fully open. These cause the charge on the trigger capacitor to be dumped
     into the primary of a pulse transformer whose secondary is connected to
     a wire, strip, or the metal reflector in close proximity to the flash
     tube.

  6. The pulse generated by this trigger (typically around 10 KV) is enough
     to ionize the Xenon gas inside the flash tube.

  7. The Xenon gas suddenly becomes a low resistance and the energy storage
     capacitor discharges through the flash tube resulting in a short
     duration brilliant white light.

The energy of each flash is roughly equal to 1/2*C*V^^2 in watt-seconds (W-s)
where V is the value of the energy storage capacitor's voltage and C is its
capacitance in. Not quite all of the energy in the capacitor is used but it
is very close. This energy storage capacitor for pocket cameras is typically
200-300 uF at 330 V (charged to 300 V) with a typical flash energy of 10 W-s.
For high power strobes, 1000s of uF at higher voltages are common with
maximum flash energies of 100 W-s or more. Another important difference is in
the cycle time. For pocket cameras it may be several seconds - or much longer
as the batteries run down. For a studio 'speed light', fractional second
cycle times are common.

Typical flash duration is much less than a millisecond resulting in crystal
clear stop action photographs of almost any moving subject.

On cheap cameras (and probably some expensive ones as well) physical contacts
on the shutter close the trigger circuit precisely when the shutter is wide
open. Better designs use an SCR or other electronic switch so that no high
voltage appears at the shutter contacts (or hot shoe connector of the flash
unit) and contact deterioration do to high voltage sparking is avoided.

Note that for cameras with focal plane shutters, the maximum shutter speed
setting that can be used is typically limited to 1/60-1/120 of a second. The
reason is that for higher shutter speeds, the entire picture is not exposed
simultaneously by the moving curtains of the focal plane mechanism. Rather, a
slit with a width determined the by the effective shutter speed moves in
front of the film plane. For example, with a shutter speed setting of 1/1000
of a second, a horizontally moving slit would need to be about 1/10 of an
inch wide for a total travel time of 1/60 of a second to cover the entire 1.5
inch wide 35 mm frame. Since the flash duration is extremely short and much
much less than the focal plane curtain travel time, only the film behind the
slit would be exposed by an electronic flash. For shutter speed settings
longer than the travel time, the entire frame is uncovered when the flash is
triggered.

See the section: @{"Photoflash circuit from pocket camera" link "9.11"} for the schematic of
a typical small battery powered strobe.

Red-eye reduction provides a means of flashing the lamp twice in rapid
succession. The idea is that the pupils of the subjects' eyes close somewhat
due to the first flash resulting in less red-eye - imaging of the inside of
the eyeball - in the actual photograph.

Automatic electronic flashes provide an optical feedback mechanism to sense
the amount of light actually reaching the subject. The flash is then aborted
in mid stride once the proper exposure has been made. Inexpensive units just
short across the flash tube with an SCR triggered by a photosensor. With
these units, the same amount of energy is used regardless of how far away the
subject is and thus low and high intensity flashes drain the battery by the
same amount and require the same cycle time. The excess energy is wasted as
heat. More sophisticated units use something like a gate turnoff thyristor to
actually interrupt the flash discharge at the proper instant. These use only
as much energy as needed and the batteries last much longer since most flash
photographs do not require maximum power.

Failure of red-eye reduction or the automatic exposure control circuits will
probably require a schematic to troubleshoot unless tests for bad connections
or shorted or open components identify specific problems.

Remotely triggered 'fill flashes' use a photocell or photodiode to fire an
SCR which emulates the camera shutter switch closure for the flash unit being
controlled. There is little to go wrong with these devices.

@node 9.7 "Problems unique to battery or AC adapter powered electronic flash units"

   o Power source - dead or weak batteries or defective charging circuit,
     incorrect or bad AC adapter, worn power switch, or bad connections.

     Symptoms: unit is totally dead, intermittent, or excessively long cycle
     time.

     Test and/or replace batteries. Determine if batteries are being charged.
     Check continuity of power switch or interlock and inspect for corroded
     battery contacts and bad connections or cold solder joints on the
     circuit board.

   o Power invertor - blown chopper transistor, bad transformer, other
     defective components.

     Symptoms: unit is totally dead or loads down power source when switched
     on (or at all times with some compact cameras). No high pitched audible
     whine when charging the capacitor. Regulator failure may result in
     excess voltage on the flash tube and spontaneous triggering or failure
     of the energy storage capacitor or other components.

     Test main chopper transistor for shorts and opens. This is the most
     likely failure. There is no easy way to test the transformer and the
     other components rarely fail. Check for bad connections.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.8 "Problems unique to AC line powered electronic flash units"

WARNING: Line powered units often do not include a power transformer.
Therefore, none of the circuitry is isolated from the AC line. Read,
understand, and follow the safety guidelines for working on line powered
equipment. Use an isolation transformer while troubleshooting. However,
realize that this will NOT protect you from the charge on the large high
voltage power supply and energy storage capacitors. Take all appropriate
precautions.

   o Power source - dead outlet or incorrect line voltage.

     Symptoms: unit is totally dead, operates poorly, catches fire, or blows
     up. Spontaneous triggering may be the result of a regulator failure or
     running on a too high line voltage (if the unit survives).

     Test outlet with a lamp or circuit tester. Check line voltage setting on
     flash unit (if it is not too late!).

   o Power supply - bad line cord or power switch, blown fuse, defective
     rectifiers or capacitors in voltage doubler, defective components, or
     bad connections.

     Symptoms: unit is totally dead or fuse blows. Excessive cycle time.

     Test fuse. If blown check for shorted components like rectifiers and
     capacitors in the power supply. If fuse is ok, test continuity of line
     cord, power switch, and other input components and wiring. Check
     rectifiers for opens and the capacitors for opens or reduced value.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.9 "Problems common to all electronic flash units"

WARNING: the amount of charge contained in the energy storage capacitor may
be enough to kill - especially with larger AC line powered flash units and
high power studio equipment. Read and follow all safety guidelines with
respect to high voltage high power equipment. Discharge the energy storage
capacitors fully (see the document: "Testing Capacitors with a Multimeter and
Safe Discharging") and then measure to double check that they are totally
flat before touching anything. Don't assume that triggering a flash does this
for you! For added insurance, clip a wire across the capacitor terminals
while doing any work inside the unit.

   o Energy storage capacitor - dried up or shorted, leaky or needs to be
     'formed'.

     Symptoms: reduced light output and unusually short cycle time may
     indicate a dried up capacitor. Heavy loading of power source with low
     frequency or weak audible whine may indicate a shorted capacitor.
     Excessively long cycle time may mean that the capacitor has too much
     leakage or needs to be formed.

     Test for shorts and value. Substitute another capacitor of similar or
     smaller uF rating and at least equal voltage rating if available.

     Cycling the unit at full power several times should reform a capacitor
     that has deteriorated due to lack of use. If the flash intensity and
     cycle time do not return to normal after a dozen or so full intensity
     flashes, the capacitor may need to be replaced or there may be some
     other problem with the power supply.

   o Trigger circuit - bad trigger capacitor, trigger transformer, SCR (if
     used), or other components.

     Symptoms: energy storage capacitor charges as indicated by the audible
     invertor whine changing frequency increasing in pitch until ready light
     comes on (if it does) but pressing shutter release or manual test button
     has no effect. Spontaneous triggering may be a result of a component
     breaking down or an intermittent short circuit.

     Test for voltage on the trigger capacitor and continuity of the trigger
     transformer windings. Confirm that the energy storage capacitor is
     indeed fully charged with a voltmeter.

   o Ready light - bad LED or neon bulb, resistor, zener, or bad connections.

     Symptoms: flash works normally but no indication from ready light. Or,
     ready light on all the time or prematurely.

     Test for voltage on the LED or neon bulb and work backwards to its
     voltage supply - either the trigger or energy storage capacitor or
     invertor trans- former. In the latter case (where load detection is used
     instead of simple voltage monitoring) there may be AC across the lamp so
     a DC measurement may be deceptive.)

   o Trigger initiator - shutter contacts or cable.

     Symptoms: manual test button will fire flash but shutter release has no
     effect.

     Test for shutter contact closure, clean hot shoe contacts (if relevant),
     inspect and test for bad connections, test or swap cable, clean shutter
     contacts (right, good luck). Try an alternate way of triggering the
     flash like a cable instead of a the hot shoe.

   o Xenon tube - broken or leaky.

     Symptoms: energy storage and trigger capacitors charges to proper
     voltage but the manual test button does not fire the flash even though
     you can hear the tick that indicates that the trigger circuit is
     discharging.

     Inspect the flash tube for physical damage. Substitute another similar
     or somewhat larger (but not smaller) flash tube. A neon bulb can be put
     across the trigger transformer output and ground to see if it flashes
     when you press the manual test button shutter release. This won't
     determine if the trigger voltage high enough but will provide an
     indication that most of the trigger circuitry is operating.

@endnode
@node 9.10 "Electronic flash dead after long time in storage"

The unit may be totally dead or take so long to charge that you give up.

For rechargeable units, try charging for the recommended time (24 hours if
you don't know what it is). Then, check the battery voltage. If it does not
indicate full charge (roughly 1.2 x n for NiCds, 2 x n for lead-acid where n
is the number of cells), then the battery is likely expired and will need to
be replaced.

Even for testing, don't just remove the bad rechargeable batteries - replace
them. They may be required to provide filtering for the power supply even
when running off the AC line or adapter.

For units with disposable batteries, of course try a fresh set but first
thoroughly clean the battery contacts.

See the sections on @{"batteries" link "12"}

The energy storage capacitor will tend to 'deform' resulting in high leakage
and reduced capacity after long non-use. However, I would still expect to be
able to hear sound of the invertor while it is attempting to charge.

Where the unit shows no sign of life on batteries or AC, check for dirty
switch contacts and bad internal connections. Electrolytic capacitors in the
power supply and invertor may have deteriorated as well.

If the unit simply takes a long time to charge, cycling it a dozen times
should restore an energy storage capacitor that is has deformed but is
salvageable. This is probably safe for the energy storage capacitor as the
power source is current limited. However, there is no way of telling if
continuous operation with the excessive load of the leaky energy storage
capacitor will overheat power supply or invertor components.

@node 9.11 "Photoflash circuit from pocket camera"

This schematic was traced from an electronic flash unit removed from an
inexpensive pocket camera. Errors in transcription are possible.

Note that the ready light is not in the usual place monitoring the energy
storage capacitor voltage. It operates on the principle that once nearly full
charge is reached and the invertor is not being heavily loaded, enough drive
voltage is available from an auxiliary winding on the invertor transformer to
light the LED. It is also interesting that the trigger circuit dumps charge
into the trigger capacitor instead of the other way around but the effect is
the same.

@node 9.12 "Darkroom timers"

Developing timers only provide a display or clock face (possibly with an
alarm) while enlarging timers include a pair of switched outlets - one for
the enlarger and the other for the safe light. These are usually self
resetting to permit multiple prints to be made at the same exposure time
setting.

Where the device plugged into a controlled outlet does not come on, first
make sure these units are operational (i.e., the bulbs of the enlarger and/or
safelight are not burned out and that their power switches are in the 'on'
position. The problem could also be that one of these devices is defective as
well.

Two types of designs are common:

  1. Electromechanical - using an AC timing motor and gear train with cam
     operated switches controlling the output circuits directly or via
     relays.

     If the hands fail to move or it does not reset properly, the timing
     motor or other mechanical parts may require cleaning and lubrication.
     The motor may be inoperative due to open or shorted windings. See the
     sections on @{"Small Motors" link "13.1"}. Where the timer appears to work but the
     controlled outlets (e.g., enlarger and safe light) do not go on or off,
     check for a loose cam or bent linkages and dirty or worn switch or relay
     contacts. If the dial fails to reset after the cycle completes, it may
     be binding or require cleaning and lubrication or a spring may have come
     loose or broken.

  2. Electronic - digital countdown circuits and logic controlling mechanical
     or solid state relays or triacs.

     Where the unit appears dead, test as with AC line powered digital clocks
     (see the section: @{"AC powered digital clock problems" link "8.3"}). If the buttons
     have the proper effect and the digits count properly but the external
     circuits are not switching, then test for problems in the power control
     circuits. If the unit is erratic or does not properly count or reset,
     there could be power supply or logic problems.

@node 10.1 "AC adapter basics"

It seems that the world now revolves around AC Adapters or 'Wall Warts' as
they tend to be called. There are several basic types. Despite the fact that
the plugs to the equipment may be identical THESE CAN GENERALLY NOT BE
INTERCHANGED. The type (AC or DC), voltage, current capacity, and polarity
are all critical to proper operation of the equipment. Use of an improper
adapter or even just reverse polarity can permanently damage or destroy the
device. Most equipment is protected against stupidity to a greater or lessor
degree but don't count on it.

The most common problems are due to failure of the output cable due to
flexing at either the adapter or output plug end. See section below on @{"repair" link "10.3"}
procedure.

  1. AC Transformer. All wall warts are often called transformers. However,
     only if the output is stated to be 'AC' is the device simply a
     transformer. These typically put out anywhere from 3 to 20 VAC or more
     at 50 mA to 3 A or more. The most common range from 6-15 VAC at less
     than an Amp. Typically, the regulation is very poor so that an adapter
     rated at 12 VAC will typically put out 14 VAC with no load and drop to
     less than 12 VAC at rated load. To gain agency approval, these need to
     be protected internally so that there is no fire hazard even if the
     output is shorted. There may be a fuse or thermal fuse internally
     located (and inaccessible).

     If the output tested inside the adapter (assuming that you can get it
     open without total destruction - it is secured with screws and is not
     glued or you are skilled with a hacksaw - measures 0 or very low with no
     load but plugged into a live outlet, either the transformer has failed
     or the internal fuse had blown. In either case, it is probably easier to
     just buy a new adapter but sometimes these can be repaired.
     Occasionally, it will be as simple as a bad connection inside the
     adapter. Check the fine wires connected to the AC plug as well as the
     output connections. There may be a thermal fuse buried under the outer
     layers of the transformer which may have blown. These can be replaced
     but locating one may prove quite a challenge.

  2. DC Power Pack. In addition to a step down transformer, these include at
     the very least a rectifier and filter capacitor. There may be additional
     regulation but most often there is none. Thus, while the output is DC,
     the powered equipment will almost always include an electronic
     regulation.

     As above, you may find bad connections or a blown fuse or thermal fuse
     inside the adapter but the most common problems are with the cable.

  3. Switching Power Supply. These are complete low power AC-DC converters
     using a high frequency invertor. Most common applications are laptop
     computers and camcorders. The output(s) will be fairly well regulated
     and these will often accept universal power - 90-250 V AC or DC.

     Again, cable problems predominate but failures of the switching power
     supply components are also possible. If the output is dead and you have
     eliminated the cable as a possible problem or the output is cycling on
     and off at approximately a 1 second rate, then some part of the
     switching power supply may be bad. In the first case, it could be a
     blown fuse, bad startup resistor, shorted/open semiconductors, bad
     controller, or other components. If the output is cycling, it could be a
     shorted diode or capacitor, or a bad controller. See the "Notes on the
     Diagnosis and Repair of Small Switchmode Power Supplies" for more info,
     especially on safety while servicing these units.

@node 10.2 "AC adapter testing"

AC adapters that are not the switching type (1 and 2 above) can easily be
tested with a VOM or DMM. The voltage you measure (AC or DC) will probably be
10-25% higher than the label specification. If you get no reading, wiggle,
squeeze, squish, and otherwise abuse the cord both at the wall wart end and
at the device end. You may be able to get it to make momentary contact and
confirm that the adapter itself is functioning.

The most common problem is one or both conductors breaking internally at one
of the ends due to continuous bending and stretching.

Make sure the outlet is live - try a lamp.

Make sure any voltage selector switch is set to the correct position. Move it
back and forth a couple of times to make sure the contacts are clean.

If the voltage readings check out for now, then wiggle the cord as above in
any case to make sure the internal wiring is intact - it may be intermittent.

Although it is possible for the adapter to fail in peculiar ways, a
satisfactory voltage test should indicate that the adapter is functioning
correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.3 "AC adapter repair"

Although the cost of a new adapter is usually modest, repair is often so easy
that it makes sense in any case.

The most common problem (and the only one we will deal with here) is the case
of a broken wire internal to the cable at either the wall wart or device end
due to excessive flexing of the cable.

Usually, the point of the break is just at the end of the rubber cable guard.
If you flex the cable, you will probably see that it bends more easily here
than elsewhere due to the broken inner conductor. If you are reasonably
dextrous, you can cut the cable at this point, strip the wires back far
enough to get to the good copper, and solder the ends together. Insulate
completely with several layers of electrical tape. Make sure you do not
interchange the two wires for DC output adapters! (They are usually marked
somehow either with a stripe on the insulator, a thread inside with one of
the conductors, or copper and silver colored conductors. Before you cut, make
a note of the proper hookup just to be sure. Verify polarity after the repair
with a voltmeter.

The same procedure can be followed if the break is at the device plug end but
you may be able to buy a replacement plug which has solder or screw terminals
rather than attempting to salvage the old one.

Once the repair is complete, test for correct voltage and polarity before
connecting the powered equipment.

This repair may not be pretty, but it will work fine, is safe, and will last
a long time if done carefully.

If the adapter can be opened - it is assembled with screws rather than being
glued together - then you can run the good part of the cable inside and
solder directly to the internal terminals. Again, verify the polarity before
you plug in your expensive equipment.

WARNING: If this is a switching power supply type of adapter, there are
dangerous voltages present inside in addition to the actual line connections.
Do not touch any parts of the internal circuitry when plugged in and make
sure the large filter capacitor is discharged (test with a voltmeter) before
touching or doing any work on the circuit board. For more info on switching
power supply repair, refer to the Notes on the Diagnosis and Repair of Small
Switchmode Power Supplies.

If it is a normal adapter, then the only danger when open are direct
connections to the AC plug. Stay clear when it is plugged in.

@endnode
@node 10.4 "AC adapter substitution and equipment damage"

Those voltage and current ratings are there for a reason. You may get away
with a lower voltage or current adapter without permanent damage but using a
higher voltage adapter is playing Russian Roulette. Even using an adapter
from a different device - even with similar ratings, may be risky because
there is no real standard. A 12 V adapter from one manufacturer may put out
12 V at all times whereas one from another manufacturer may put out 20 V or
more when unloaded.

A variety of types of protection are often incorporated into adapter powered
equipment. Sometimes these actually will save the day. Unfortunately,
designers cannot anticipate all the creative techniques people use to prove
they really do not have a clue of what they are doing.

The worst seems to be where an attempt is made to operate portable devices
off of an automotive electrical system. Fireworks are often the result, see
below and the section on: @{"Automotive power" link "12.10"}

If you tried an incorrect adapter and the device now does not work there are
several possibilities (assuming the adapter survived and this is not the
problem):

  1. An internal fuse blew. This would be the easiest to repair.

  2. A protection diode sacrificed itself. This is usually reverse biased
     across the input and is supposed to short out the adapter if the
     polarity is reversed. However, it may have failed shorted particularly
     if you used a high current adapter (or automotive power).

  3. Some really expensive hard to obtain parts blew up. Unfortunately, this
     outcome is all too common.

I inherited a Sony Discman from a guy who thought he would save a few bucks
and make an adapter cord to use it in his car. Not only was the 12-15 volts
from the car battery too high but he got it backwards! Blew the DC-DC
converter transistor in two despite the built in reverse voltage protection
and fried the microcontroller. Needless to say, the player was a loss but the
cigarette lighter fuse was happy as a clam!

Moral: those voltage, current, and polarity ratings marked on portable
equipment are there for a reason. Voltage rating should not be exceeded,
though using a slightly lower voltage adapter will probably cause no harm
though performance may suffer. The current rating of the adapter should be at
least equal to the printed rating. The polarity, of course, must be correct.
If connected backwards with a current limited adapter, there may be no
immediate damage depending on the design of the protective circuits. But
don't take chances - double check that the polarities match - with a
voltmeter if necessary - before you plug it in! Note that even some
identically marked adapters put out widely different open circuit voltages.
If the unloaded voltage reading is more than 25-30% higher than the marked
value, I would be cautious about using the adapter without confirmation that
it is acceptable for your equipment. Needless to say, if you experience any
strange or unexpected behavior with a new adapter, if any part gets unusually
warm, or if there is any unusual odor, unplug it immediately and attempt to
identify the cause of the problem.

@node 11.1 "AC (plug-in) power supplies"

Reread Safety info before tackling any power supply problem in a VCR!

If you equipment uses an AC adapter (wall wart), read the section on
@{"AC adapters" link "10"} first.

Consumer electronic equipment typically uses one of four types of power
supplies (There are no doubt others):

  1. Power transformer with linear regulator using 78/79XX ICs or discrete
     components. The power transformer will be large and very near the AC
     line cord.

  2. Power transformer with hybrid regulator like STK5481 or any of its
     cousins - multioutput with some outputs switched by power on. If it has
     one of these, check ECG, SK, or NTE, or post to sci.electronics.repair
     and someone can probably provide the pinout. Again, the power
     transformer will be large and very near the AC line cord.

  3. Small switching power supply. Most common problems: shorted
     semiconductors, bad capacitors, open fusable resistors. In this case
     there is usually no large power transformer near the line input but a
     smaller transformer amidships. This is rare in audio equipment as the
     switching noise is difficult to keep out of the audio circuits. These
     are more often found found in some VCRs, TVs, monitors, fax machines,
     and printers.

Some comments for each type:

  1. Troubleshooting is quite straightforward as the components are readily
     identified and it is easy to trace through from the power transformer,
     bridge or centertapped full wave rectifiers, regulators, caps, etc.

  2. Failures of one or more of the outputs of these hybrid regulators are
     very common. Use ECG/STK/NTE cross reference to identify the correct
     output voltages. Test with power switch in both positions. Any
     discrepancy indicates likely problem. While an excessive load dragging
     down a voltage is possible, the regulator is the first suspect.
     Replacement cost is usually under $10.

  3. Switching supplies. These are tougher to diagnose, but it is possible
     without service literature by tracing the circuit and checking for bad
     semiconductors with an ohmmeter. Common problems - dried up capacitors,
     shorted semiconductors, and bad solder joints. See 'Notes on Diagnosis
     and Repair of Small Switchmode Power Supplies' for more detailed
     information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.2 "Totally dead power supply (non-switching type)"

Don't overlook the possibility of bad solder connections or even a bad line
cord or plug. Maybe Fido was hungry.

First, make sure the outlet is live - try a lamp. Even a neon circuit tester
is not a 100% guarantee - the outlet may have a high resistance marginal
connection.

Check for blown fuses near the line cord input. With the unit unplugged, test
for continuity from the AC plug to the fuse, on/off switch and power
transformer. With the power switch in the 'on' position, testing across the
AC plug should result in a resistance of 1 to 100 ohms depending on the size
of the equipment (see the section: 
@{"Internal fuse blew during lightening storm (or elephant hit power pole" link "14.6"})
for typical resistance readings of transformer primary windings.

If the fuse blew and the readings are too low, the transformer primary may be
partially or totally shorted. If the resistance is infinite even directly
across the primary of the power transformer, it may be open or there may be
an open thermal fuse underneath the outer layer of insulation wrapping.

If the fuse blew but resistance is reasonable, try a new fuse of the proper
ratings. If this blows instantly, there is still a fault in the power supply
or one of its loads. See the section: @{"About fuses and circuit breakers" link "11.5"}

If these check out, then the problem is likely on the secondary side. One or
more outputs may be low or missing due to bad regulator components. A
secondary winding could be open though is is less common than primary side
failure as the wire (in transistorized equipment at least) is much thicker.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.3 "Low or missing power supply outputs (non-switching type)"

Once the line input and primary circuits have been found to be good (or at
have continuity and a resistance that is reasonable, the problems is most
likely in the secondary side - fuses, rectifiers, filter capacitors,
regulator components, bad connections, excess load due to electronic problems
elsewhere.

Depending on the type of equipment, there may be a single output of several
outputs from the power supply. A failure of one of these can result in
multiple systems problems depending on what parts of the equipment use what
supply.

Check for bad fuses in the secondary circuits - test with an ohmmeter. (I
once even found an intermittent fuse!) Try a new fuse of the same ratings. If
this one blows immediately, there is a fault in the power supply or one of
its loads. See the section: @{"About fuses and circuit breakers" link "11.5"}. The use of a
series current limiting resistor - a low wattage light bulb, for example -
may be useful to allow you to make measurements without undo risk of damage
and an unlimited supply of fuses.

Locate the large electrolytic filter capacitor(s). These will probably be
near the power transformer connections to the circuit board with the power
supply components. Test for voltage across each of these with power on. If
they are in pairs, this may be a dual polarity supply (+/-, very common in
audio equipment). Sometimes, two or more capacitors are simply used to
provide a higher uF rating. If you find no voltage on one of these
capacitors, trace back to determine if the problem is a rectifier diode, bad
connection, or bad secondary winding on the power transformer (the latter is
somewhat uncommon as the wire is relatively thick, however).

Dried up electrolytic capacitors will result in excessive ripple leading to
hum or reduced headroom in audio outputs and possible regulation problems as
well. Test with a scope or multimeter on its AC scale (but not all
multimeters have DC blocking capacitors on its AC input and these readings
may be confused by the DC level). If ripple is excessive - as a guideline if
it is more than 10 to 20% of the DC level - then substitute or jumper across
with a good capacitor of similar uF rating and at least the same voltage
rating.

If you find voltages that are lower than expected, this could be due to bad
filter capacitors, an open diode or connection (one side of a full wave
rectifier circuit), or excessive load which may be either in the
regulator(s), if any, or driven circuitry.

Disconnect the output of the power supply from its load. If the voltage jumps
up dramatically (or the fuse now survives or the series light bulb now goes
out or glows dimly), then a short or excess load is likely.

If the behavior does not change substantially, the problem may be in the
regulator(s). Transistors, zener diodes, resistors, and other discrete
components, and IC regulators like LM317s or 7809s can be tested with an
ohmmeter or by substitution. The most common failures are shorts for
semiconductors, opens for resistors, and no or low output for ICs.

Where the supply uses a hybrid regulator like an STK5481, confirming proper
input and then testing each output is usually sufficient to identify a
failure. A defective hybrid regulator will likely provide no or very low
output on one or more outputs. Confirm by disconnecting the load. Test with
any on/off (logic) control in both states.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.4 "Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) and power invertors"

CAUTION: reread safety guidelines as portions of these devices can be nasty.

NOTE: inexpensive UPSs and invertors generate a squarewave output so don't be
surprised at how ugly the waveform appears if you look at it on a scope. This
is probably normal. More sophisticated and expensive units may use a modified
sinewave - actually a 3 or 5 level discrete approximation to a sinewave
(instead of a 2 level squarewave). The highest quality units will generate a
true sinewave using high frequency bipolar pulse width modulation. Don't
expect to find this in a $100 K-Mart special, however.

A UPS incorporates a battery charger, lead-acid (usually) storage battery,
DC-AC invertor, and control and bypass circuitry.

Note that if finding a UPS that provides surge protection is an important
consideration, look for one that runs the output off of the battery at all
times rather than bypassing the invertor during normal operation. The battery
will act as a nearly perfect filter in so far as short term line voltage
variations, spikes, and noise, are concerned.

A DC-AC power invertor used to run line powered equipment from an automotive
battery or other low voltage source is similar to the internal invertor in a
UPS.

For a unit that appears dead (and the power has not been off for more than
its rated holdup time and the outlet is live), first, check for a blown fuse
- external or internal. Perhaps, someone was attempting to run their
microwave oven off of the UPS or invertor!

(See the section on: @{"Fuse post mortems" link "11.6"} to identify likely failure mode.)

If you find one - and it is blown due to a short circuit - then there are
likely internal problems like shorted components. However, if it is blown due
to a modest overload, the powered equipment may simply be of too high a
wattage for the UPS or invertor - or it may be defective.

Failures of a UPS can be due to:

  1. Battery charging circuit - if the battery does not appear to be charging
     even after an extended time, measure across the battery with the unit
     both unplugged and plugged in. The voltage should jump up some amount
     with power on - when it is supposed to be charging. Disconnect the
     battery and try again if there is no action - the battery may be shorted
     totally. Check for blown fuses, smoked parts, and bad connections.

  2. Battery - deteriorated or abused lead acid batteries are very common. If
     the battery will not charge or hold a charge, battery problems are
     likely. A UPS (or any kind of lead-acid battery powered equipment) that
     lies idle for a long time (say a year or two) without power to top off
     the battery will likely result in a dead - not salvageable - battery due
     to sulfation. Symptoms will be: voltage on battery climbs to more than
     2.5 V per cell when first put on charge and even after a long charging
     period, the battery has essentially no capacity. If the battery voltage
     is at its nominal value - even when the invertor should be running from
     it (and there is no or low output), then there is a problem in the
     invertor or its connections or there is excess load.

  3. Invertor - troubleshooting is similar to that required for a switchmode
     power supply. Common problems: shorted power semiconductors, open
     fusable resistors, dried up electrolytic capacitors, and bad
     connections. See the document: "Notes on the Diagnosis and Repair of
     small SwitchMode Power Supplies (SMPS)". A visual inspection may reveal
     parts that have exploded or lost their smoke.

  4. Line bypass circuit (if used) - check for problems in the controller or
     its standby power supply, or power switchover components, and bad
     connections.

@endnode
@node 11.5 "About fuses, IC protectors, and circuit breakers"

The purpose of fuses and circuit breakers is to protect both the wiring from
heating and possible fire due to a short circuit or severe overload and to
prevent damage to the equipment due to excess current resulting from a failed
component or improper use (i.e., excess volume to loudspeakers).

Fuses use a fine wire or strip (called the element) made from a metal which
has enough resistance (more than for copper usually) to be heated by current
flow and which melts at a relatively low well defined temperature. When the
rated current is exceeded, this element heat up enough to melt (or vaporize).
How quickly this happens depends on the extent of the overload and the type
of fuse.

Fuses found in consumer electronic equipment are usually cartridge type -
1-1/4" mm x 1/4" or 20 mm x 5 mm, pico fuses that look like green 1/4 W
resistors, or other miniature varieties. Typical circuit board markings are F
or PR.

IC protectors are just miniature fuses specifically designed to have a very
rapid response to prevent damage to sensitive solid state components
including intergrated circuits and transistors. These usually are often in
TO92 plastic cases but with only 2 leads or little rectangular cases about
.1" W x .3" L x .2" H. Test just like a fuse. These may be designated ICP,
PR, or F.

Circuit breakers may be thermal, magnetic, or a combination of the two. Small
(push button) circuit breakers for electronic equipment are most often
thermal - metal heats up due to current flow and breaks the circuit when its
temperature exceeds a set value. The mechanism is often the bending action of
a bimetal strip or disc - similar to the operation of a thermostat. Flip type
circuit breakers are normally magnetic. An electro- magnet pulls on a lever
held from tripping by a calibrated spring. These are not usually common in
consumer equipment (but are used at the electrical service panel).

At just over the rated current, it may take minutes to break the circuit. At
10 times rated current, the fuse may blow or circuit breaker may open in
milliseconds.

The response time of a 'normal' or 'rapid action' fuse or circuit breaker
depends on the instantaneous value of the overcurrent.

A 'slow blow' or 'delayed action' fuse or circuit breaker allows
instantaneous overload (such as normal motor starting) but will interrupt the
circuit quickly for significant extended overloads or short circuits. A large
thermal mass delays the temperature rise so that momentary overloads are
ignored. The magnetic type breaker adds a viscous damping fluid to slow down
the movement of the tripping mechanism.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.6 "Fuse post mortems"

Quite a bit can be inferred from the appearance of a blown fuse if the inside
is visible as is the case with a glass cartridge type. One advantage to the
use of fuses is that this diagnostic information is often available!

A fuse which has an element that looks intact but tests open may have just
become tired with age. Even if the fuse does not blow, continuous cycling at
currents approaching its rating or instantaneous overloads results in
repeated heating and cooling of the fuse element. It is quite common for the
fuse to eventually fail when no actual fault is present.

A fuse where the element is broken in a single or multiple locations blew due
to an overload. The current was probably more than twice the fuse's rating
but not a dead short.

A fuse with a blackened or silvered discoloration on the glass where the
entire element is likely vaporized blew due to a short circuit.

This information can be of use in directly further troubleshooting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.7 "Fuse or circuit breaker replacement"

As noted, sometimes a fuse will blow for no good reason. Replace fuse, end of
story. In this situation, or after the problem is found, what are the rules
of safe fuse replacement? It is inconvenient, to say the least, to have to
wait a week until the proper fuse arrives or to tromp out to Radio Shack in
the middle of the night.

Even with circuit breakers, a short circuit may so damage the contacts or
totally melt the device that replacement will be needed.

Four parameters characterizes a fuse or circuit breaker:

  1. Current rating - this should not be exceeded (you have heard about not
     putting pennies in fuse boxes, right?) (The one exception to this rule
     is if all other testing fails to reveal which component caused the fuse
     to blow in the first place. Then, and only then, putting a larger fuse
     in or jumpering across the fuse **just for testing** will allow the
     faulty component to identify itself by smoking or blowing its top!) A
     smaller current rating can safely be used but depending on how close the
     original rating was to the actual current, this may blow immediately.

  2. Voltage rating - this is the maximum safe working voltage of the circuit
     (including any inductive spikes) which the device will safety interrupt.
     It is safe to use a replacement with equal or high voltage rating.

  3. Type - normal, fast blow, slow blow, etc. It is safe to substitute a
     fuse or circuit breaker with a faster response characteristic but there
     may be consistent or occasional failure mostly during power-on. The
     opposite should be avoided as it risks damage to the equipment as
     semiconductors tend to die quite quickly.

  4. Mounting - it is usually quite easy to obtain an identical replacement.
     However, as long as the other specifications are met, soldering a normal
     1-1/4" (3AG) fuse across a 20 mm fuse is perfectly fine, for example.

@node 12.1 "Battery technology"

The desire for portable power seems to be increasing exponentially with the
proliferation of notebook and palmtop computers, electronic organizers, PDAs,
cellular phones and faxes, pagers, pocket cameras, camcorders and audio
cassette recorders, boomboxes - the list is endless.

Two of the hottest areas in engineering these days are in developing higher
capacity battery technologies (electrochemical systems) for rechargeable
equipment and in the implementation of smart power management (optimal
charging and high efficiency power conversion) for portable devices. Lithium
and Nickel Metal Hydride are among the more recent additions to the inventory
of popular battery technologies. A variety of ICs are now available to
implement rapid charging techniques while preserving battery life. Low cost
DC-DC convertor designs are capable of generating whatever voltages are
required by the equipment at over 90% efficiency

However, most of the devices you are likely to encounter still use pretty
basic battery technologies - most commonly throwaway Alkaline and Lithium
followed by rechargeable Nickel Cadmium or Lead-Acid. The charging circuits
are often very simple and don't really do the best job but it is adequate for
many applications.

For more detailed information on all aspects of battery technology, see the
articles at:

http://www.paranoia.com/~filipg/HTML/FAQ/BODY/F_Battery.html

There is more on batteries than you ever dreamed of ever needing. The next
sections represent just a brief introduction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.2 "Battery basics"

A battery is, strictly speaking, made up of a number of individual cells
(most often wired in series to provide multiples of the basic cell voltage
for the battery technology - 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, or 3.0 V are most common).
However, the term is popularly used even for single cells.

Four types of batteries are typically used in consumer electronic equipment:

  1. Alkaline - consisting of one or more primary cells with a nominal
     terminal voltage of 1.5 V. Examples are AAA, AA, C, D, N, 9V
     ('transistor'), lantern batteries (6V or more), etc. There are many
     other available sizes including miniature button cells for specialty
     applications like clocks, watches, calculators, and cameras. In general
     recharging of alkaline batteries is not practical due to their chemistry
     and construction. Exceptions which work (if not entirely consistently as
     of this writing) are the rechargeable Alkalines (e.g., 'Renewals').
     Advantages of alkalines are high capacity and long shelf life. These now
     dominate the primary battery marketplace largely replacing the original
     carbon-zinc and heavy duty types. Note that under most conditions, it
     not necessary to store alkaline batteries in the 'fridge to obtain
     maximum shelf life.

  2. Lithium - these primary cells have a much higher capacity than
     alkalines. The terminal voltage is around 3 volts per cell. These are
     often used in cameras where their high cost is offset by the convenience
     of long life and compact size. Lithium batteries in common sizes like 9V
     are beginning to appear. In general, I would not recommend the use of
     lithiums for use in applications where a device can be accidentally left
     on - particularly with kids' toys. Your batteries will be drained
     overnight whether a cheap carbon zinc or a costly lithium. However, for
     smoke alarms, the lithium 9V battery (assuming they hold up to their
     longevity claims) is ideal as a 5-10 year service life without attention
     can be expected.

  3. Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) - these are the most common type of rechargeable
     battery technology use in small electronic devices. They are available
     in all the poplar sizes. However, their terminal voltage is only 1.2 V
     per cell compared to 1.5 V per cell for alkalines (unloaded). This is
     not the whole story, however, as NiCds terminal voltage holds up better
     under load and as they are discharged. Manufacturers claim 500-1000
     charge-discharge cycles but expect to achieve these optimistic ratings
     only under certain types of applications. In particular it is usually
     recommended that NiCds should not be discharged below about 1 V per cell
     and should not be left in a discharged state for too long. Overcharging
     is also an enemy of NiCds and will reduce their ultimate life. An
     electric shaver is an example of a device that will approach this cycle
     life as it is used until the battery starts to poop out and then
     immediately put on charge. If a device is used and then neglected (like
     a seldom used printing calculator), don't be surprised to find that the
     NiCd battery will not charge or will not hold a charge next time the
     calculator is used.

  4. Lead Acid - similar to the type used in your automobile but generally
     specially designed in a sealed package which cannot leak acid under most
     conditions. These come in a wide variety of capacities but not in
     standard sizes like AA or D. They are used in some camcorders,
     flashlights, CD players, security systems, emergency lighting, and many
     other applications. Nominal terminal voltage is 2.0 V per cell. These
     batteries definitely do not like to be left in a discharged condition
     (even more so than NiCds) and will quickly become unusable if left that
     way for any length of time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.3 "Battery chargers"

Each type of battery requires a different type of charging technique.

  1. NiCd batteries are charged with a controlled (usually constant) current.
     Fast charge may be performed at as high as a .5-1C rate for the types of
     batteries in portable tools and laptop computers. (C here is the
     amp-hour capacity of the battery. A .5C charge rate for a 2 amp hour
     battery pack would use a current equal to 1 A, for example.) Trickle
     charge at a 1/20-1/10C rate. Sophisticated charges will use a variety of
     techniques to sense end-of-charge. Inexpensive chargers (and the type in
     many cheap consumer electronics devices) simply trickle charge at a
     constant current. Rapid chargers for portable tools, laptop computers,
     and camcorders, do at least sense the temperature rise which is one
     indication of having reached full charge but this is far from totally
     reliable and some damage is probably unavoidable as some cells reach
     full charge before others due to slight unavoidable differences in
     capacity. Better charging techniques depend on sensing the slight
     voltage drop that occurs when full charge is reached but even this can
     be deceptive. The best power management techniques use a combination of
     sensing and precise control of charge to each cell, knowledge about the
     battery's characteristics, and state of charge.

     Problems with simple NiCd battery chargers are usually pretty easy to
     find - bad transformer, rectifiers, capacitors, possibly a regulator.
     Where temperature sensing is used, the sensor in the battery pack may be
     defective and there may be problems in the control circuits as well.
     However, more sophisticated power management systems controlled by
     microprocessors or custom ICs and may be impossible to troubleshoot for
     anything beyond obviously bad parts or bad connections.

  2. Lead acid batteries are charged with a current limited but voltage
     cutoff technique. Although the terminal voltage of a lead-acid battery
     is 2.00 V per cell nominal, it may actually reach more than 2.5 V per
     cell while charging. For an automotive battery, 15 V is still within the
     normal range of voltages to be found on the battery terminals when the
     engine (and alternator) are running.

     A simple charger for a lead acid battery is simply a stepped down
     rectified AC source with some resistance to provide current limiting.
     The current will naturally taper off as the battery voltage approaches
     the peaks of the charging waveform. This is how inexpensive automotive
     battery chargers are constructed. For small sealed lead acid batteries,
     an IC regulator may be used to provide current limited constant voltage
     charging. A 1 A (max) charger for a 12 V battery may use an LM317, 3
     resistors, and two capacitors, running off of a 15 V or greater input
     supply.

     Problems with lead acid battery chargers are usually pretty easy to
     diagnose due to the simplicity of most designs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.4 "Substituting NiCds for Alkalines"

First note that rechargeable batteries are NOT suitable for safety critical
applications like smoke detectors unless they are used only as emergency
power fail backup (the smoke detector is also plugged into the AC line) and
are on continuous trickle charge). NiCds self discharge (with no load) at a
rate which will cause them to go dead in a month or two.

For many toys and games, portable phones, tape players and CD players, and
boomboxes, TVs, palmtop computers, and other battery gobbling gadgets, it may
be possible to substitute rechargeable batteries for disposable primary
batteries. However, NiCds have a lower terminal voltage - 1.2V vs. 1.5V - and
some devices will just not be happy. In particular, tape players may not work
well due to this reduced voltage not being able to power the motor at a
constant correct speed. Manufacturers may specifically warn against their
use.  Flashlights will not be as bright unless the light bulb is also
replaced with a lower voltage type. Other equipment may perform poorly or
fail to operate entirely on NiCds. When in doubt, check your instruction
manual.

@endnode
@node 12.5 "NiCd batteries and the infamous 'memory effect'"

Whether the NiCd 'memory effect' is fact or fiction seems to depend on one's
point of view and anecdotal evidence. What most people think is due to the
memory effect is more accurately described as voltage depression - reduced
voltage (and therefore, reduced power and capacity) during use.

(The next section is from: Bob Myers (myers@fc.hp.com) and are based on a GE
technical note on NiCd batteries.)

The following are the most common causes of application problems wrongly
attributed to 'memory':

  1. Cutoff voltage too high - basically, since NiCds have such a flat
     voltage vs. discharge characteristic, using voltage sensing to determine
     when the battery is nearly empty can be tricky; an improper setting
     coupled with a slight voltage depression can cause many products to call
     a battery "dead" even when nearly the full capacity remains usable
     (albeit at a slightly reduced voltage).

  2. High temperature conditions - NiCds suffer under high-temp conditions;
     such environments reduce both the charge that will be accepted by the
     cells when charging, and the voltage across the battery when charged
     (and the latter, of course, ties back into the above problem).

  3. Voltage depression due to long-term overcharge - Self-explanatory. NiCds
     can drop 0.1-0.15 V/cell if exposed to a long-term (i.e., a period of
     months) overcharge. Such an overcharge is not unheard-of in consumer
     gear, especially if the user gets in the habit of leaving the unit in a
     charger of simplistic design (but which was intended to provide enough
     current for a relatively rapid charge). As a precaution, I do NOT leave
     any of my NiCd gear on a charger longer than the recommended time UNLESS
     the charger is specifically designed for long-term "trickle charging",
     and explicitly identified as such by the manufacturer.

  4. There are a number of other possible causes listed in a "miscellaneous"
     category; these include -
      o Operation below 0 degrees C.
      o High discharge rates (above 5C) if not specifically designed for such
        use.
      o Inadequate charging time or a defective charger.
      o One or more defective or worn-out cells. They do not last forever.

To close with a quote from the GE note:

"To recap, we can say that true 'memory' is exceedingly rare. When we see
poor battery performance attributed to 'memory', it is almost always certain
to be a correctable application problem. Of the...problems noted above,
Voltage Depression is the one most often mistaken for 'memory'.....

This information should dispel many of the myths that exaggerate the idea of
a 'memory' phenomenon."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.6 "Care and feeding of NiCds"

Here are six guidelines to follow which will hopefully avoid voltage
depression or the memory effect or whatever:

(Portions of the following guidelines are from the NiCd FAQ written by: Ken
A. Nishimura (KO6AF))

  1. DON'T deliberately discharge the batteries to avoid memory. You risk
     reverse charging one or more cell which is a sure way of killing them.

  2. DO let the cells discharge to 1.0V/cell on occasion through normal use.

  3. DON'T leave the cells on trickle charge for long times, unless voltage
     depression can be tolerated.

  4. DO protect the cells from high temperature both in charging and storage.

  5. DON'T overcharge the cells. Use a good charging technique. With most
     inexpensive equipment, the charging circuits are not intelligent and
     will not terminate properly - only charge for as long as recommended in
     the user manual.

  6. DO choose cells wisely. Sponge/foam plates will not tolerate high
     charge/discharge currents as well as sintered plate. Of course, it is
     rare that this choice exists.

@node 12.7 "Zapping NiCds to clear shorted cells"

Nickel-Cadmium batteries that have shorted cells can sometimes be rejuvenated
- at least temporarily - by a procedure affectionately called 'zapping'.

The cause of these bad NiCd cells is the formation of conductive filaments
called whiskers or dendrites that pierce the separator and short the positive
and negative electrodes of the cell. The result is either a cell that will
not take a charge at all or which self discharges in a very short time. A
high current pulse can sometimes vaporize the filament and clear the short.

The result may be reliable particularly if the battery is under constant
charge (float service) and/or is never discharged fully. Since there are
still holes in the separator, repeated shorts are quite likely especially if
the battery is discharged fully which seems to promote filament formation,

I have used zapping with long term reliability (with the restrictions
identified above) on NiCds for shavers, Dust Busters, portable phones, and
calculators.

WARNING: There is some danger in the following procedures as heat is
generated. The cell may explode! Take appropriate precautions and don't
overdo it. If the first few attempts do not work, dump the battery pack.

ATTEMPT ZAPPING AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!

You will need a DC power supply and a large capacitor - one of those 70,000
uF 40 V types used for filtering in multimegawatt geek type automotive audio
systems, for example. A smaller capacitor can be tried as well.

Alternatively, a you can use a 50-100 A 5 volt power supply that doesn't mind
(or is protected against) being overloaded or shorted.

Some people recommend the use of a car battery for NiCd zapping. DO NOT be
tempted - there is nearly unlimited current available and you could end with
a disaster including the possible destruction of that battery, your NiCd,
you, and anything else that is in the vicinity.

OK, you have read the warnings:

Remove the battery pack from the equipment. Gain access to the shorted
cell(s) by removing the outer covering or case of the battery pack and test
the individual cells with a multimeter. Since you likely tried charging the
pack, the good cells will be around 1.2 V and the shorted cells will be
exactly 0 V. You must perform the zapping directly across each shorted cell
for best results.

Connect a pair of heavy duty clip leads - #12 wire would be fine - directly
across the first shorted cell. Clip your multimeter across the cell as well
to monitor the operation. Put it on a high enough scale such that the full
voltage of your power supply or capacitor won't cause any damage to the
multimeter.

WEAR YOUR EYE PROTECTION!!!

  1. Using the large capacitor:

     Charge the capacitor from a current limited 12-24 V DC power supply.

     Momentarily touch the leads connected across the shorted cell to the
     charged capacitor. There will be sparks. The voltage on the cell may
     spike to a high value - up to the charged voltage level on the
     capacitor. The capacitor will discharge almost instantly.

  2. Using the high current power supply:

     Turn on the supply.

     Momentarily touch the leads connected across the shorted cell to the
     power supply output. There will be sparks. DO NOT maintain contact for
     more than a couple of seconds. The NiCd may get warm! While the power
     supply is connected, the voltage on the cell may rise to anywhere up to
     the supply voltage.

Now check the voltage on the (hopefully previously) shorted cell.

If the filaments have blown, the voltage on the cell should have jumped to
anywhere from a few hundred millivolts to the normal 1 V of a charged NiCd
cell. If there is no change or if the voltage almost immediately decays back
to zero, you can try zapping couple more times but beyond this is probably
not productive.

If the voltage has increased and is relatively stable, immediately continue
charging the repaired cell at the maximum SAFE rate specified for the battery
pack. NOTE: if the other cells of the battery pack are fully charged as is
likely if you had attempted to charge the pack, don't put the entire pack on
high current charge as this will damage the other cells through overcharging.

One easy way is to use your power supply with a current limiting resistor
connected just to the cell you just zapped. A 1/4 C rate should be safe and
effective but avoid overcharging. Then trickle charge at the 1/10 C rate for
several hours. (C here is the amp-hour capacity of the cell. Therefore, a
1/10 C rate for a 600 mA NiCd is 50 mA.)

This works better on small cells like AAs than on C or D cells since the
zapping current requirement is lower. Also, it seems to be nearly impossible
to reliably restore the quick charge type battery packs in portable tools and
laptop computers that have developed shorted cells.

@endnode
@node 12.8 "Problems with battery operated equipment"

For primary batteries like Alkalines, first try a fresh set. For NiCds, test
across the battery pack after charging overnight (or as recommended by the
manufacturer of the equipment). The voltage should be 1.2 x n V where n is
the number of cells in the pack. If it is much lower - off by a multiple of
1.2 V, one or more cells is shorted and will need to be replaced or you can
attempt zapping it to restore the shorted cells. See the section:
@{"Zapping NiCds to clear shorted cells" link "12.7"}. Attempt at your own risk!

If the voltage drops when the device is turned on or the batteries are
installed - and the batteries are known to be good - then an overload may be
pulling the voltage down.

Assuming the battery is putting out the proper voltage, then a number of
causes are possible:

  1. Corroded contacts or bad connections in the battery holder.

  2. Bad connections or broken wires inside the device.

  3. Faulty regulator in the internal power supply circuits. Test
     semiconductors and IC regulators.

  4. Faulty DC-DC invertor components. Test semiconductors and other
     components.

  5. Defective on/off switch (!!) or logic problem in power control.

  6. Other problems in the internal circuitry.

@node 12.9 "Battery juice and corroded contacts"

Unless you have just arrived from the other side of the galaxy (where such
problems do not exist), you know that so-called 'leak-proof' batteries
sometimes leak. This is a lot less common with modern technologies than with
the carbon-zinc cells of the good old days, but still can happen. It is
always good advice to remove batteries from equipment when it is not being
used for an extended period of time. Dead batteries also seem to be more
prone to leakage than fresh ones (in some cases because the casing material
is depleted in the chemical reaction which generates electricity and thus
gets thinner or develops actual holes).

In most cases, the actual stuff that leaks from a battery is not 'battery
acid' but rather some other chemical. For example, alkaline batteries are so
called because their electrolyte is an alkaline material - just the opposite
in reactivity from an acid. Usually it is not particularly reactive (but
isn't something you would want to eat).

The exception is the lead-acid type where the liquid inside is sulfuric acid
of varying degrees of strength depending on charge. This is nasty and should
be neutralized with an alkaline material like baking soda before being
cleaned up. Fortunately, these sealed lead-acid battery packs rarely leak
(though I did find one with a scary looking bulging case, probably due to
overcharging - got rid of that is a hurry).

Scrape dried up battery juice from the battery compartment and contacts with
a plastic or wooden stick and/or wipe any liquid up first with a dry paper
towel. Then use a damp paper towel to pick up as much residue as possible.
Dispose of the dirty towels promptly.

If the contacts are corroded, use fine sandpaper or a small file to remove
the corrosion and brighten the metal. Do not an emery board or emery paper or
steel wool as any of these will leave conductive particles behind which will
be difficult to remove. If the contacts are eaten through entirely, you will
have to improvise alternate contacts or obtain replacements. Sometimes the
corrosion extends to the solder and circuit board traces as well and some
additional repairs may be needed - possible requiring disassembly to gain
access to the wiring.

@node 12.10 "Automotive power"

While it is tempting to want to use your car's battery as a power source for
small portable appliances, audio equipment, and laptop computers, beware: the
power available from your car's electrical system is not pretty. The voltage
can vary from 9 (0 for a dead battery) to 15 V under normal conditions and
much higher spikes or excursions are possible. Unless the equipment is
designed specifically for such power, you are taking a serious risk that it
will be damaged or blown away.

Furthermore, there is essentially unlimited current available from the
battery (cigarette lighter) - 20 A or more. This will instantly turn your
expensive CD player to toast should you get the connections wrong. No amount
of internal protection can protect equipment from fools.

My recommendation for laptop computers is to use a commercially available
DC-AC invertor with the laptop's normal AC power pack. This is not the most
efficient but is the safest and should maintain the laptop's warranty should
something go wrong. For CD players and other audio equipment, only use
approved automotive adapters.

@node 13.1 "Small motors in consumer electronic equipment"

A variety of motor types are found in audio and other electronic equipment.
For the additional information on the specific types of motors used in VCRs
and CD players, see the documents for these types of equipment.

Types of motors:

  1. Small brush-type permanent magnet (PM) DC motors similar to those found
     in battery operated appliances. Such motors are used in cassette decks
     and boomboxes, answering machines, motorized toys, CD players and CDROM
     drives, and VCRs. Where speed is critical, these may include an internal
     mechanical governor or electronic regulator. In some cases there will be
     an auxiliary tachometer winding for speed control feedback.

     These are usually quite reliable but can develop shorted or open
     windings, a dirty commutator, gummed up lubrication, or dry or worn
     bearings. Replacement is best but mechanical repair (lubrication,
     cleaning) is sometimes possible. Also see the sections on @{"tape speed" link "4"}
     problems.

     Additional info on these types of motors can be found in "Notes on CD
     Technology and the Repair of CD Players and CDROM Drives".

  2. A low profile or 'pancake' brushless DC motor may provide power for a in
     some Walkman type tape players, direct drive capstans and general power
     in VCRs or tape decks. Since these are electronically controlled, any
     non-mechanical failures are difficult to diagnose. In some cases,
     electronic component malfunction can be identified and remedied.

  3. AC induction motors - shaded pole or synchronous type used in
     inexpensive turntables. These motors are extremely reliable and are easy
     to disassemble, clean, and lubricate. Just do not lose any of the spacer
     washers on each end of the shaft and make notes to assure proper
     reassembly.

  4. Miniature synchronous motors used in mechanical clock drives as found in
     older clock radios or electric clocks powered from the AC line,
     appliance controllers, and refrigerator defrost timers. These assemblies
     include a gear train either sealed inside the motor or external to it.
     If the motor does not start up, it is probably due to dried gummed up
     lubrication. Getting inside can be a joy but it is usually possible to
     pop the cover and get at the rotor shaft (which is usually where the
     lubrication is needed). However, the tiny pinion gear may need to be
     removed to get at both ends of the rotor shaft and bearings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.2 "Motor noise in audio equipment"

Of course you expect your audio equipment to be absolutely silent unless told
to perform. Motor noise should not be objectionable. However, what if it is?
There are several kinds of noise: rotating noise, vibration, and electrical
interference:

If the noise is related to the rotating motor shaft, try lubricating the
motor (or other suspect) bearings - a single drop of electric motor oil,
sewing machine oil, or other light oil (NOT WD40 - it is not a suitable
lubricant), to the bearings (at each end for the motor). This may help at
least as a temporary fix. In some cases, using a slightly heavier oil will
help with a worn bearing. See the section:
@{"Lubrication of electronic equipment" link "4.3"}

For AC motors in particular, steel laminations or the motor's mounting may be
loose resulting in a buzz or hum. Tightening a screw or two may quiet it
down.  Painting the laminations with varnish suitable for electrical
equipment may be needed in extreme cases. Sometimes, the noise may actually
be a result of a nearby metal shield or other chassis hardware that is being
vibrated by the motor's magnetic field. A strategically placed shim or piece
of masking tape may work wonders.

If the noise - a buzz or whine - is actually coming from the audio output but
only occurs with the motor running, the interference filter on the motor
power supply may have failed. This is often just a capacitor across the motor
terminals and it may be defective or there may be a bad connection.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.3 "Finding a replacement motor"

In many cases, motors are fairly standardized and you may be able to find a
generic replacement much more cheaply than the original manufacturer's part.
However, the replacement must match the following:

  1. Mechanical - you must be able to mount it. In most cases, this really
     does mean an exact drop-in. Sometimes, a slightly longer shaft or
     mounting hole out of place can be tolerated. The pulley or other drive
     bushing, if any, must be able to be mounted on the new motor's shaft. If
     this is a press fit on the old motor, take extreme care so as not to
     damage this part when removing it (even if this means destroying the old
     motor in the process - it is garbage anyway).

  2. Electrical - the voltage and current ratings must be similar.

  3. Rotation direction - with conventional DC motors, this may be reversible
     by changing polarity of the voltage source. With AC motors, turning the
     stator around with respect to the rotor will reverse rotation direction.
     However, some motors have a fixed direction of rotation which cannot be
     altered.

  4. Speed - for tape players and turntables - this may not be feedback
     controlled. With a little care you should be able to determine the
     normal rpms of the motor. For example, with a cassette deck, knowing the
     tape speed (1-7/8" inches per second is standard), it is straightforward
     calculate the motor shaft speed based on simple measurements of pulley
     and capstan diameter ratios.

MCM Electronics, Dalbani, and Premium Parts stock a variety of generic
replacement motors for tape decks, Walkmen, boomboxes, and CD players.

@node 13.4 "Relay basics"

The ubiquitous electromechanical relay is a device that is used in a large
variety of applications to switch power as well as signals in electrical and
electronic equipment. Operation is quite simple: An electromagnet powered by
an AC or DC coil pulls on an armature having a set of moving contacts which
make or break a connection with a set of stationary contacts.

Most common relays can be characterized by three sets of parameters:

  1. Coil - voltage; resistance, current, or power consumption; and whether
     it is AC or DC. For AC coils only, the VA (volt-amps) rating may be used
     instead of or in addition to power consumption due to the inductive
     coil. Typical coil voltages range from 5 V to 480 V (AC or DC) - and
     beyond. Current and power consumption depend on the size of the relay.

  2. Contact configuration - number of sets of contacts and whether they are
     their type. The designation will be something like SPST-NO, DPDT,
     4PST-NC, 6PDT, etc. The first two letters refers to the number of sets
     of simultaneously activated contacts (S=1, D=2, numbers are usually used
     for more than 2 sets of contacts). The second two letters refers to the
     contact configuration (ST=NO or NC but no common terminal, DT will have
     a common - there will be both an NO and NC terminal). Where contacts are
     ST, the last two letters indicate NO or NC. An almost unlimited number
     of variations are possible. Typical relays have anywhere from 1 to 6 or
     more separate sets of ST or DT contacts or a mixture of the two.

  3. Contact ratings - this may be specified for a number of types of
     applications. For example: in amperes at a particular voltage for DC
     resistive loads, or in horsepower at various voltages for AC inductive
     loads. Like fuse ratings, these are maximum ratings and lower values are
     almost always acceptable. Small relays may be able to switch only a few
     hundred mA at 32 V while large industrial contactors can switch 1000s of
     A at 1000s of V. Even the contactor in your automobile's starter must
     control hundreds of amps to the starter motor.

The common (C) contacts connect to the normally closed (NC) contacts when the
coil is unpowered and to the normally open (NO) contacts when the coil is
powered.

Miniature and subminiature relays are used to switch phone line signals in
modems, fax machines, and telephone answering machines; audio amplifier
speaker protection circuits; multiscan monitor deflection components; and
many other places.

Small relays control power in lighting equipment, TVs and other home
appliances, automotive systems and accessories, and the like.

Large relays (often called contactors) are used for the control of central
air conditioning systems (compressor and blower motors), all types and sizes
of industrial machinery - as well as in the starter of your automobile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.5 "Relay identification"

A relay without a pin connection diagram can usually be identified with a
multimeter and variable power supply - or by eye. Many have the critical
information printed on the cover. However, for detailed specifications,
referring to the manufacturer's databook (or WEB page) really is best!

(The following assumes a subminiature (DIP) relay. Lower coil resistances,
higher coil voltages, and other variations may exist for larger relays.)

  1. If the case of the relay is transparent or you can pop the top, examine
     the pole piece of the electromagnet. If there is a (copper) ring around
     half the pole piece, the relay coil is designed for AC (usually line
     frequency - 50 or 60 Hz) operation. An AC relay operated on DC will
     overheat very quickly but can be tested on DC.

  2. Determine the coil pins. Use your eyeball if possible or your multimeter
     on the low resistance scale. For a small relay, the coil will most
     likely be a few hundred ohms. All other combinations of pins will be
     zero or infinity. If the resistance is under, say, 100 ohms, you may
     have an AC coil rather than a DC coil.

  3. Power the relay from a variable DC supply (I am assuming it has a DC
     coil which is likely for a DIP relay. You can still do this with an AC
     coil but it will heat up quickly). Start at zero and increase the
     voltage until you hear the contacts close. This will probably be at
     around 3 volts (for a 5 V coil) or 8 volts for a 12 V coil - this will
     be roughly 60% of nominal coil voltage. If you do not hear anything,
     reverse the polarity of the coil and try again - you may have a latching
     relay. Alternatively, put your multimeter on the resistance scale across
     one of the pairs of pins that measured zero ohms as it is likely to be a
     NC set of contacts. This will change to infinity ohms when the relay
     switches.

  4. Now that you can switch the relay on and off, you can use your
     multimeter on the resistance scale to determine which contacts are
     normally open (NO) and which contacts are normally closed (NC).
     (Normally here means unpowered.)

  5. The power rating of the contacts can be estimated by their diameter (if
     they are visible). Rough current estimates (resistive loads): 20 A - 5
     mm, 10 A - 3 mm, 5 A - 2 mm, 1 A - 1 mm. These must be derated
     substantially for inductive loads.

For latching relays, the polarity of the coil voltage determines whether the
relay is switched on or off. In other words, to switch to the opposite state
requires the polarity of the voltage to the coil to be reversed. Other types
are possible but not very common.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.6 "Relay testing and repair"

If the relay is totally inoperative, test for voltage to the coil. If the
voltage is correct, the relay may have an open coil. If the voltage is low or
zero, the coil may be shorted or the driving circuit may be defective. If the
relay makes a normal switching sound but does not correctly control its
output connections, the contacts may be corroded, dirty, worn, welded closed,
binding, or there may be other mechanical problems.

Remove the relay from the circuit (if possible) and measure the coil
resistance. Compare your reading with the marked or specified value and/or
compare with a known working relay of the same type. An open coil is
obviously defective but sometimes the break is right at the terminal
connections and can be repaired easily. If you can gain access by removing
the cover, a visual examination will confirm this. If the resistance is too
low, some of the windings are probably shorted. This will result in
overheating as well as no or erratic operation. Replacement will be required.

Relay contacts start out bright and shiny. As they are used, arcing, dirt,
and wear take their toll. A sealed relay used at well below its rated current
with a resistive load may work reliably for millions of cycles. However, this
will be significantly reduced when switching high currents - especially with
inductive loads which results in contact arcing. One speck of dirt can
prevent a contact from closing so cleanliness is important. Excessive arcing
can result in the contacts getting welded together as well.

The resistance of closed contacts on a relay that is in good condition should
be very low - probably below the measurable limits on a typical multimeter -
a few milliohms. If you measure significant or erratic resistance for the
closed contacts as the relay is switched or if very gentle tapping results in
erratic resistance changes, the contacts are probably dirty, corroded, or
worn. If you can get at the contacts, the use of contact cleaner first and a
piece of paper pulled back and forth through the closed contacts may help.
Superfine sandpaper may be used as a last resort but this is only a short
term fix. The relay will most likely need to be replaced if the contacts are
switching any substantial power.

@endnode
@node 14.1 "IC and hybrid power audio amplifiers"

(NOTE: troubleshooting of large audio amplifiers constructed with discrete
output stages is left to a separate document.)

The audio amplifiers found in small radios, Walkmen, portable cassette
recorders, and other low power devices are often single chips with few
external components. Obtain a pin diagram, test inputs and output(s) with an
audio signal tracer and/or oscilloscope. A dead output where inputs and power
are present usually indicate a defective IC - as does one that becomes
excessively hot - assuming that the output is not overloaded.

Larger audio amplifiers may use ICs (up to 10 or 20 W) or hybrid modules (up
to 100 W per channel and beyond). Purists may argue about the quality of the
sound from these compared to discrete component designs but they are being
used in many designs - at most price points (except perhaps the stratosphere
of audiophile land).

Hybrids modules (called 'blocks' or 'bricks' by some) may be totally self
contained requiring just power and line level inputs or may be just the final
stage in an overall system including external amplifier circuitry which is
effectively a power op amp - high gain with negative feedback. Failure of
these bricks is quite common.

Note that testing of these op amp designs - whether discrete or brick based -
can be very confusing due to the high gain and feedback. Intermediate signals
in a working channel may look like power supply ripple and noise. In a dead
channel these same points may appear to be normal or highly distorted audio
depending on which stage you test. In addition, since extensive negative
feedback is used, power supply ripple and noise is much less important
significant and there may be substantial amounts of both in a normally
operating amplifier.

With stereo amplifiers, it is normally safe - and most effective - to swap
components between the working and dead channels as long as you are sure
there is no short circuit on the output. This is by far the quickest way to
confirm a dead brick. (I would be a lot more reluctant to make this
recommendation for a large audio amplifier constructed with discrete
transistors in the final power stage as multiple cascade failures are
possibly and likely if ALL defective parts are not located before power is
reapplied.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.2 "Noisy or intermittent switches and controls"

Symptoms include audible noise when rotating knobs, erratic operation of mode
selectors, random changes in volume, switches, or controls that need to be
jiggled or tapped to make them cooperate.

The causes are likely to be either dirt or wear.

First, try a spray control/contact cleaner - even the stuff from Radio Shack
may make a remarkable difference iff (1) dirt is the problem and (2) you can
get the cleaner inside the troublesome part.

Some types of contact and control cleaners can be used safely with low
voltage circuits while they are powered but not always - read the label
directions. Select a product that specifically states that is it safe for
switches and controls.

Use the extension tube that comes with the spray can and snake it into or
near any visible access holes. Operate the control or switch to help the
cleaning action. Don't overdoe it - if you get to the right spot, a little is
all that is needed.

Resist the urge to use sandpaper or steelwool (ack!) on switch or connector
contacts. However, pulling a piece paper through a set of contacts or the
occasional gentle use of a soft pencil eraser (e.g., Pink Pearl) may be
helpful.

If this does not help - or only helps short term - the part may be worn.
Sometimes, repair is possible (a slide switch with contacts that have
loosened with use, for example) but replacement is better - if you can find
an exact or suitably close match. See the section:
@{"Interchangeability of components" link "16.2"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.3 "General intermittent or erratic behavior"

Any intermittent problems that cause random sudden changes in performance are
likely due to bad connections, internal connectors that need to be cleaned
and reseated, or dirty switches and controls. First, see the section:
@{"Noisy or intermittent switches and controls" link "14.2"}

Bad solder joints are very common in consumer electronic equipment due both
to poor quality manufacturing where cost reduction may be the most important
consideration. In addition solder connections deteriorate after numerous
thermal cycles, vibration, and physical abuse. Circuit board connections to
large hot parts or parts that may have mechanical stress applied to them are
most likely be suffer from hairline solder fractures (often called 'cold
solder joints' when they result from poor quality soldering at the time of
manufacture). However, since the solder is often the only thing anchoring
these components, mechanical stress can eventually crack the solder bond as
well.

To locate cold solder joints, use a strong light and magnifier and examine
the pins of large components and components that are subject to physical
stress (like headphone jacks and power connectors) for hairline cracks in the
solder around the pin. Gently wiggle the component if possible (with the
power off). Any detectable movement at the joint indicates a problem. A just
perceptible hairline crack around the pin is also an indication of a
defective solder connection. With the power on, gently prod the circuit board
and suspect components with an insulated tool to see if the problem can be
effected.

When in doubt, resolder any suspicious connections. Some device may use
double sided circuit boards which do not have plated through holes. In these
cases, solder both top and bottom to be sure that the connections are solid.
Use a large enough soldering iron to assure that your solder connection is
solid. Put a bit of new solder with flux on every connection you touch up
even if there was plenty of solder there before.

In addition to soldering problems, check for loose or corroded screw type
ground (or other) terminals, and internal connectors that need to be cleaned
and reseated.

@node 14.4 "Need to turn up volume to get sound to come on"

If at times, it is necessary to turn the volume way up or possibly to tap or
whack the unit to get the sound in one or both channels to come on when the
unit is first powered up, the speaker protection relay could be faulty.
Receivers and audio amplifiers often include a set of relay contacts in
series with each output to protect the loudspeakers from power-on and
power-off transients as well as damage due to a fault in the audio circuits.
However, these contacts may deteriorate after awhile resulting in
intermittent sound.

While this set of symptoms could be the result of general bad connections or
even dirty controls or switches, the relay is often at fault. This is
exacerbated by switching the unit on and off at high volume levels as well as
this may cause contact arcing.

To determine if the relay is at fault, either test it as outlined in the
section: @{"Relay testing" link "13.6"} or with the unit on, very gently tap the relay to
see if the sound comes as goes. If the relay is bad, you can try cleaning its
contacts or replace with one that has similar electrical specifications as
long as you can mount is somehow. Don't be tempted to bypass the relay as it
serves a very important protective function for both the amplifier and your
loudspeakers.

If it is not the relay, see the sections: @{"General intermittent or erratic behavior" link "14.3"}
as well as @{"Noisy or intermittent switches and controls" link "14.2"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.5 "Equipment hums or buzzes"

Assuming there are no other symptoms and the sound is coming from inside the
unit and not the loudspeakers, this is probably simply due to vibrating
laminations in the power transformer or motor(s) or nearby sheetmetal that is
affected by the magnetic fields from the power transformer or motor(s). Most
of the time, this is harmless but can definitely be quite annoying especially
when one expects total silence from their audio equipment. If the noise is
coming from any motors or their vicinity, refer to the section:
@{"Motor noise in audio equipment" link "13.2"}

Sometimes, simply tightening the screws that hold the transformer or motor
together or the mounting screws will be all that is needed. Placing a
toothpick or piece of plastic in a strategic location may help. It is also
possible to coat the offending component with a varnish or sealer suitable
for electronic equipment but be careful not to use so much that cooling is
compromised or getting any in bearings or locations that would interfere with
rotating parts.

If the hum or buzz is in the audio, there could be a bad filter capacitor in
the power supply, other power supply problems, bad grounds inside the unit or
general ground problems with external equipment, or other bad connections.
Disconnect all external devices (except the speakers if you do not have a
pair of headphones) and determine if the problem still exists. Proceed
accordingly.

Overloads can also cause a hum or buzz but would generally result in other
symptoms like a totally or partially dead amplifier, severe distortion,
smoke, six foot flames, etc.

Sometimes, simply tightening the screws that hold the transformer or motor

If the problem is only annoying when the equipment is not in use, as a last
resort (where no memory or clock functions run off the AC line), putting in
an AC line switch may not be such a bad idea.

@node 14.6 "Internal fuse blew during lightening storm (or elephant hit power pole)"

Power surges or nearby lightening strikes can destroy electronic equipment.
However, most of the time, damage is minimal or at least easily repaired.
With a direct hit, you may not recognize what is left of it!

Ideally, electronic equipment should be unplugged (both AC line and phone
line!) during electrical storms if possible. Modern TVs, VCRs, microwave
ovens, and even stereo equipment is particularly susceptible to lightening
and surge damage because some parts of the circuitry are always alive and
therefore have a connection to the AC line. Telephones, modems, and fax
machine are directly connected to the phone lines. Better designs include
filtering and surge suppression components built in. With a near-miss, the
only thing that may happen is for the internal fuse to blow or for the
microcontroller to go bonkers and just require power cycling. There is no
possible protection against a direct strike. However, devices with power
switches that totally break the line connection are more robust since it
takes much more voltage to jump the gap in the switch than to fry electronic
parts. Monitors and TVs may also have their CRTs magnetized due to the
electromagnetic fields associated with a lightening strike - similar but on a
smaller scale to the EMP of a nuclear detonation.

Was the unit operating or on standby at the time? If was switched off using
an actual power switch (not a logic pushbutton), then either a component in
front of the switch has blown, the surge was enough to jump the gap between
the switch contacts, or it was just a coincidence (yeh, right).

If it was operating or on standby or has no actual power switch, then a
number of parts could be fried.

Many devices have their own internal surge protection devices like MOVs
(Metal Oxide Varistors) after the fuse. So it is possible that all that is
wrong is that the line fuse has blown. Remove the case (unplug it!) and start
at the line connector. If you find a blown fuse, remove it and measure across
the in-board side of fuse holder and the other (should be the neutral) side
of the line. With the power switch off, this reading should be very high.
With the switch on, it may be quite low if the unit uses a large power
transformer (a few ohms or less). For example (assuming power transformer
operated supply):

   o Small AC adapter - 100 to 500 ohms.
   o Large AC adapter - 10 to 100 ohms.
   o VCR - 15 to 30 ohms.
   o Cassette deck or CD player - 25 to 100 ohms.
   o Stereo receiver or amplifier - .5 to 10 ohms.

Some may be outside these ranges but if the reading is extremely low, the
power transformer could have a partially or totally shorted primary. If it is
very high (greater than 1 K ohms), then the primary of the power transformer
may be open or there may be blown thermal fuse under the outer insulation
wrappings of the transformer windings. This may be replaceable.

If the unit has a switching power supply, see the document: "Notes on the
Diagnosis and Repair of small SwitchMode Power Supplies (SMPS)".

If the resistance checks out, replace the fuse and try powering the unit.
There will be 3 possibilities:

  1. It will work fine, problem solved.

  2. It will immediately blow the fuse. This means there is at least one
     component shorted - possibilities include an MOV, line filter capacitor,
     transformer primary.

  3. It will not work properly or still appear dead. This could mean there
     are blown fuses or fusable resistors or other defective parts in the
     power supply or other circuitry. In this case further testing will be
     needed and at some point you may require the schematic.

Use of surge suppressors and line filters: Should you always use a surge
suppressor outlet strip or line circuit? Sure, it shouldn't hurt. Just don't
depend on these to provide protection under all circumstances. Some are
better than others and the marketing blurb is at best of little help in
making an informed selection. Product literature - unless it is backed up by
testing from a reputable lab - is usually pretty useless and often confusing.

Line filters can also be useful if power in you area is noisy or prone to
spikes or dips.

However, keep in mind that most well designed electronic equipment already
includes both surge suppressors like MOVs as well as L-C line filters. More
is not necessarily better but may move the point of failure to a readily
accessible outlet strip rather than the innards of your equipment if damage
occurs.

It is still best to unplug everything if the air raid sirens go off or you
see an elephant wearing thick glasses running through the neighborhood (or an
impending lightening storm).

@endnode
@node 14.7 "Equipment dropped or abused"

I have heard of someone fighting off a would-be mugger with a tape deck but
this is generally not a recommended practice. However, once it happens - your
cassette deck fell off its shelf or you prized walkman fell from your hang
glider (ok, maybe that will be too much even for miracles) - what should you
do?

Overall, electronic equipment - especially portable devices - are quite
tough.  However, falling or being beaten in just the wrong way can do
substantial and possibly not immediately visible damage.

If you take it in for service, the estimate you get may make the national
debt look like pocket change in comparison. Attempting to repair anything
that has been dropped is a very uncertain challenge - and since time is money
for a professional, spending an unknown amount of time on a single repair is
very risky. There is no harm is getting an estimate (though many shops charge
for just agreeing that what you are holding was once a - say - tapedeck!)

This doesn't mean you should not tackle it yourself. There may be nothing
wrong or very minor problems that can easily be remedied.

First, unplug the unit even if it looks fine. Until you do a thorough
internal inspection, there is no telling what may have been knocked out of
whack or broken. Electrical parts may be shorting due to a broken circuit
board or one that has just popped free. Don't be tempted to apply power even
if there are no obvious signs of damage - turning it on may blow something
due to a shorting circuit board. If it is a portable, remove the batteries.

Then, inspect the exterior for cracking, chipping, or dents. In addition to
identifying cosmetic problems, this will help to locate possible areas to
check for internal damage once the covers are removed.

Next, remove the covers and check for mechanical problems like a bent or
deformed brackets, cracked plastic parts, and anything that may have shifted
position or jumped from its mountings.

Carefully straighten any bent metal parts. Replace parts that were knocked
loose, glue and possibly reinforce cracked or broken plastic. Plastics, in
particular, are troublesome because most glues - even plastic cement - do not
work very well. Using a splint (medical term) or sistering (construction
term) to reinforce a broken plastic part is often a good idea. Use multiple
layers of Duco Cement or clear windshield sealer and screws (sheetmetal or
machine screws may be best depending on the thickness and type of plastic).
Wood glue and Epoxy do not work well on plastic. Some brands of superglue,
PVC pipe cement, or plastic hobby cement may work depending on the type of
plastic.

Cycle the the mechanism and check for free movement of the various moving
parts.

Inspect for any broken electronic components - these will need to be
replaced. Check for blown fuses - the initial impact may have shorted
something momentarily which then blew a fuse.

There is always a slight risk that the initial impact has already fried
electronic parts as a result of a momentary short or from broken circuit
traces and there will still be problems even after repairing the visible
damage and/or replacing the broken components.

Examine the circuit boards for any visible breaks or cracks. These will be
especially likely at the corners where the stress may have been greatest. If
you find **any** cracks, no matter how small in the circuit board, you will
need to carefully inspect to determine if any circuit traces run across these
cracks. If they do, then there are certainly breaks in the circuitry which
will need to be repaired. Circuit boards in consumer equipment are almost
never more than two layers so repair is possible but if any substantial
number of traces are broken, it will take a great deal of painstaking work to
jumper across these traces with fine wire - you cannot just run over them
with solder as this will not last. Use a fine tipped low wattage soldering
iron under a magnifying lens and run #28-30 gauge insulated wires between
convenient endpoints - these don't need to be directly on either side of the
break. Double check each connection after soldering for correct wiring and
that there are no shorts before proceeding to the next.

If the circuit board is beyond hope or you do not feel you would be able to
repair it in finite time, replacements may be available but their cost is
likely to be more than the equipment is worth. Locating a junk unit of the
same model to cannibalize for parts may be a more realistic option.

Once all visible damage has been repaired and broken parts have been
replaced, power it up and see what happens. Be prepared to pull the plug if
there are serious problems (billowing smoke would qualify). Determine if it
appears to initialize correctly - without shutting down. Play a garbage tape
to determine if there are any problems that might damage the tape. Listen
carefully for any evidence of poor tracking, tape speed instability, or weak
or muddy audio that might indicate that tape path alignment requires further
attention. Listen as well for any unexpected mechanical sounds that were not
there before.

Very likely, the unit will be fine, you can replace the covers, and now find
a more secure spot for it to prevent this sort of event in the future. Maybe
hang gliding is just not for you!

@endnode
@node 14.8 "Boombox or other equipment went to the beach (sand and/or surf)"

A (former) relative took your boombox to the beach this summer and now it has
sand or perhaps salt in it. Or, maybe you could not resist "sing'n in the
rain" and a big bus went by without slowing. Now neither of the tape decks
will play. Can this possibly be fixed? Will it be worth the effort?

Unless this is a really expensive sophisticated unit, I doubt whether it will
pay you to take it anywhere for repair. Furthermore, as with equipment that
has been dropped or physically abused, few repair shops will be inclined to
touch the job. They really don't like challenges of this sort.

That leaves you!

If saltwater was involved in a significant way, you can probably forget it.
Without immediate attention, saltwater corrosion can set in very quickly and
attacks electronic components, circuit board traces, cable wiring, and
mechanical parts. The only thing worse is damage caused by forgotten, leaky
batteries.

Although it is probably too late, the first thing to do when electronic
equipment gets wet is to remove the power source - switch it off and pull the
plug or remove the batteries if possible. Don't be tempted to apply power
until you have determined that it is completely dried out. If power was on
when the 'incident' took place, then electronic damage may have already
resulted which will not be apparent until after cleaning, drying, and
lubrication.

The following description assumes a dual cassette boombox. Adjust as
appropriate for your patient:

If the tape decks are totally dead, you may have serious electronic or
corrosion which will make any salvage unlikely. If they sort of move (or even
twitch a bit) but the sound is erratic, weak, fluttery, etc. then there may
be hope. (Of course, if it got wet, you should not have done this test until
everything was cleaned and dried!)

NEVER use strong solvents for any cleaning. These may attack plastic parts or
cause internal damage to electronic components.

Mechanical intensive care:

  1. Remove the tape decks. This will be a pain but otherwise you will not be
     able to get at everything. Make as many as drawings as needed so you
     will be able to reassemble.

  2. Make a drawing of the belt routing, remove the belt(s), wash and dry
     them, label and set them aside.

  3. Use a soft brush (like a paintbrush) to dust out as much sand as
     possible. Hopefully, you can get it all this way. A vacuum cleaner with
     a wand attachment may prove handy to suck out sand. Don't use high
     pressure compressed air - it will just spread the sand around. Any
     grease or oil on which sand has collected will need to be totally
     removed and replaced with fresh lubrication.

  4. If there is evidence of salt (remember, I said forget it...but), you
     will need to wash it off. Yes, wash it. Keep water out of the motors.
     Use low pressure compressed air (a blow dryer on low heat should be
     fine) to dry so that it does not rust. Ditto if it is still wet with
     contaminated liquid (we won't say where this came from), wash with fresh
     water to remove all traces of it as quickly as possible. A final rinse
     with 91% or pure isopropyl alcohol will decrease drying time and should
     not damage mechanical assemblies. Degreaser may be used if it is safe
     for plastic and rubber parts.

     Lubricate all bearing points with a drop of light machine oil - electric
     motor oil, sewing machine oil, etc. (Never never never WD40). Lubricate
     gears, cams, and sliding parts with a light plastic safe grease.

  5. Replace the belts and reinstall the tape decks.

Electronic intensive care:

  1. Remove the circuit boards and label the connectors if there is any
     possibility of getting them mixed up. If the circuit board(s) are
     soldered to the rest of the equipment, then you will have to improvise.

  2. Wash with water and dry thoroughly. This does work. I use it routinely
     for degunking remote controls and rubber membrane keypads, for example.
     The most important objective should be to get corrosive liquids off the
     components and circuit traces as quickly and completely as possible. A
     final rinse with isopropyl alcohol will decrease drying time. However,
     there is a slight risk of damage to sensitive electronic components
     should some be trapped inside. Moisture will be trapped in controls,
     coils, selector switches, relays, transformer cores, connectors, and
     under large components like ICs. Pat dry, then use warm air from a hair
     dryer (or heat gun on low) to completely dry every nook and cranny. DO
     NOT operate until everything inside and out is thoroughly dry.

  3. Inspect for damage due to short circuits including blown fuses, fried
     components, and melted traces. These will need to be repaired or
     replaced.

  4. Use spray contact cleaner on the switches and control cleaner on the
     user controls and adjustment pots. DO NOT turn the internal adjustments
     without precisely marking the original positions - else realignment will
     be needed. Exercise the user controls to help the cleaning process.

Once everything is reassembled, power the unit up and see what happens. Be
prepared to pull the plug or pop the batteries if there are serious problems.
Attempt to play a garbage tape to determine if there are any problems that
might damage the tape. Look and listen for any abnormalities which may
require additional attention. There could still be electronic faults not
repairable without schematics and test equipment.

Obviously, this description is very simplistic. The important thing is to get
every last grain of sand, salt, and other contaminants off of the mechanisms
quickly.

Similar comments apply to equipment that went for an actual swim - you
dropped your portable CD player in the toilet. The most important objective
is to clean and dry it as quickly as possible and then relube any motor and
other bearings. Use your judgement as to the severity of the dunking in terms
of how deeply the liquid penetrated. Surface moisture will not hurt anything
as long as it is dried up quickly. If you left it soaking on the other
hand....

As noted above, moisture may collect inside certain electronic parts and it
is essential that these be dried completely before attempting to apply power
to the unit. If you do not, at best it will not work properly and you may do
additional serious damage due to short circuits.

For the mechanics, the same applies though this is trickier since certain
parts need to be lubricated and these may not be readily accessible or
obvious. Don't be tempted to overdo the lubrication either - too much is
worse that too little.

For high tech devices like CD players, some parts of the internal optics or
shielded DC-DC convertors may be impossible to access and clean of scum.

@node 14.9 "Reviving old (antique) equipment"

If you have a true antique - really old, and valuable, you should refer to
the extensive literature available on this subject. The following applies
more to that 30 year old record player/amp found in the storage loft of your
garage during spring cleaning.

Common problems relate to two types of components: vacuum tubes (valves for
all of you on the other side of the lake) and capacitors (paper and
electrolytic type). Thorough cleaning of all socket and switch contacts, and
controls will also be needed.

WARNING: the voltages inside tube type equipment can exceed 400 V - and
contact with that can be real painful not to say dangerous. AC-DC type sets
are not isolated from the power line. (In some really old equipment, even the
chassis may be tied to one side of the line). This could also happen as a
result of a shorted component. The electrolytic capacitors can hold a charge
for quite a while. Read, understand, and follow the recommendations in the
Safety document. Use extreme care when probing or even touching anything.
This isn't 5 V logic!

Vacuum tubes:

It is not possible to fully test vacuum tubes without proper equipment but
the inspection and tests below will find most bad tubes but will not pick up
weak tubes. As a side note, when a repair shop replaced tubes, perhaps 20 %
of the tubes they replaced were actually bad (I know because the local TV
repair shop's trash can was a favorite hangout on pickup day and nearly all
the tubes I scrounged tested perfectly good on a real tube tester once they
were washed of coffee grounds and cigarette ash!) Whether this represented
legitimate preventive maintenance or just IPM - Increased Profit Margin, I
really do not know.)

  1. Look for a silvery metallic spot somewhere inside the tube. This is the
     getter and is there to remove the last traces of gasses. If you see
     this, the vacuum is intact. If it is milky white or red, the tube has
     lost its vacuum and is dead-dead.

  2. Use an ohmmeter to test for filament continuity. The nice thing about
     tubes (aside from their cheery glow) is that you can see inside (at
     least for the ones with a glass envelope) and locate the filament
     connections by tracing from the pins - it will be the whitish fine wire
     in the center of each of the tube sections. (The filament is almost
     always pins 3 & 4 on a 7 pin tube, 4 & 5 on a 9 pin tube, and 2 & 7 on
     an 8 pin tube.)

  3. You can check for inter-element shorts (but not at normal operating
     conditions) with a VOM or DMM. For glass tubes, even without a tube
     manual, you should be able to deduce which elements are supposed to be
     isolated by visual examination.

Now, just jump into your time machine, back about 20-30 years should do it
(remember?) when every corner drugstore and TV repair shop had a tube tester.
There is, of course a good chance that your local TV repair shop still has
one (if they can find it under an inch layer of dust) and it may even work.

Capacitors and resistors:

If you just dug this thing out of the attic, it is very likely that
electrolytic capacitors have dried up and paper capacitors have turned leaky.
Professional restorers will often install modern replacements for all of
these capacitors without even testing the old ones.

Old carbon resistors can absorb moisture and change value. If your
measurements do not agree with their marked rating based on their tolerance,
consider replacements. However, if within, say, 20 %, for now, leave them
alone.

Sockets, switches, and controls:

Vacuum and/or use a small paintbrush to remove dust, spider webs, dead
insects (and anything larger).

Use contact cleaner on all the tube sockets and selector switches. Use
control cleaner on all the potentiometers and reostats. Apply a drop of oil
to any variable capacitor bearings and mechanical dial pointers.

Testing (use an isolation transformer with AC-DC line connected sets):

Much of this old equipment had schematic diagrams pasted to the cover -
really handy if the paper hasn't totally disintegrated.

Turn on the power but be prepared to pull the plug in a hurry if, for
example, a capacitor should decide to blow up (this shouldn't be a problem if
you replaced them all unless some electrolytics are in backwards).

Do the filaments light up? If your equipment has a power transformer, the
filaments are probably wired in parallel, so if one tube is out, that tube is
bad (or its socket). If they are all out, then the power transformer or AC
line input is bad.

If it is an AC-DC set like a table radio, then the tube filaments are wired
in series. If one is bad, they will all be out. Get out your ohmmeter, pull
each tube, and check it for filament continuity.

Assuming the filaments check out - all sections glowing (for metal tubes,
feel the case for warmth after a few minutes though this won't guarantee that
all sections are alive) when power is applied:

Check for DC voltages out of the power supply. There will be big filter
capacitors - check across those. Watch out: we are talking several hundred
volts and BIG capacitors - ouch.

With no signal, check plate voltages on the various stages - there should
something. If you measure 0, then a plate resistor or coil could be open or
the tube may be shorted.

The rest is just basic troubleshooting. Think of the vacuum tubes as oversize
high voltage depletion mode FETs (field effect tubes, why not?). This is not
much different than modern equipment except for the bites the relatively high
voltages can take out of your hide.

@node 14.10 "TV/VCR combos"

These hybrids which include both a TV and VCR (and sometimes other stuff as
well) seem to combine the worst of all possibilities. Although, in principle,
the idea of a combination TV/VCR sounds good - no cabling to worry about,
ease of use, compatibility assured, the result may be less than meets the
eye.  While TV/VCR combo units do include both a TV screen and a VCR
transport, very often there is only a single shared tuner so that viewing and
recording of different programs is not possible unless one is from an
external baseband video source (assuming there is a suitable input jack) like
- you guessed it - a VCR or laserdisc player.

If either the TV or VCR poops out and needs repair, the entire unit may be
unusable either because of shared circuitry or because the whole thing is in
the shop. Construction quality tends to be shoddy and some designs are poor
to begin with. Finally, as if this is not enough, servicing is difficult and
painful because everything is crammed into a single compact (at least that is
a good feature!) unit.

Refer to the appropriate documents for your particular problems - not only
TVs and VCRs, but also Audio and Miscellaneous for shared systems like the
power supply.

@node 14.11 "Boomboxes and compact stereo systems"

These combine a stereo receiver and a single or dual cassette deck, and/or a
CD player or changer, and a pair of detachable speakers, into a single unit.
Most are fairly portable but larger boomboxes and compact stereos may require
a forklift to move any great distance.

While the individual subsystems - CD player for example - are usually
relatively self contained electrically except for a common power supply,
mechanically, everything tends to be jumbled together - even on units that
have an outward appearance of separate components. Both cassette transports
are usually driven from a single motor. Getting at the CD player may require
removal of both cassette decks, audio amplifier, and power supply. Working on
these is not fun. As usual, take careful notes as you disassemble the unit
and expect it to require some time just to get to what you are after. Be
especially careful when removing and replacing the individual modules if
printed flex cables are used for interconnections.

Refer to the relevant sections on cassette transports, loudspeakers, and
power supplies for problems with these units. Refer to the document: CD
Technology and the Diagnosis and Repair of CD Players and CDROM Drives for
CD specific problems.

Since these do get abused - bumped, dropped, dunked, etc., bad connections,
and other damage is very common. See the sections:

@node 14.12 "Revival of dead or tired remote control units"

There are two types of problems with hand held remote controls: they have
legs of their own and they get abused or forgotten. I cannot help you with
walking remotes.

Where response is intermittent or the reliable operating distance is reduced,
first check the batteries and battery contacts. If some buttons are
intermittent or dead, than the most likely cause is dirty or worn contacts
under the rubber buttons or on the circuit board.

If there is no response to any functions by the TV or VCR, verify that any
mode switches are set correctly (on both the remote and the TV or VCR).
Unplug the TV or VCR for 30 seconds (not just power off, unplug). This
sometimes resets a microcontroller that may have been confused by a power
surge. Confirm that the remote has not accidentally been set to an incorrect
mode (VCR instead of TV, for example). If it a universal type, it may have
lost its programming - reset it. Make sure you are using the proper remote if
have multiple similar models.

Test the remote with an IR detector. An IR detector card can be purchased for
about $6. Alternatively, construct the IR detector circuit described in the
companion document: "Notes on the Repair of Hand Held Remote Controls".

If the remote is putting out an IR signal, then the remote or the TV or VCR
may have forgotten its settings or the problem may be in the TV or VCR and
not the hand unit. The following is just a summary - more detailed
information is available in the companion document: "Notes on the Repair of
Hand Held Remote Controls".

Problems with remote hand units:

All except (1) and (2) require disassembly - there may be a screw or two and
then the case will simply 'crack' in half by gently prying with a knife or
screwdriver. Look for hidden snap interlocks.

  1. Dead batteries - solution obvious.

  2. Corroded battery contacts, Thoroughly remove chemical deposits. Clean
     contacts with pencil eraser and/or sandpaper or nailfile.

  3. Broken connections often between battery contacts and circuit board,
     possibly on the circuit board - resolder.

  4. Bad resonator or crystal - replace, but diagnosing this without an
     oscilloscope may be tough. Broken connections on resonator legs are
     common.

  5. Dirt/spills/gunk preventing keys from operating reliably. Disassemble
     and wash rubber membrane and circuit board with water and mild detergent
     and/or then alcohol - dry completely.

  6. Worn or corroded contact pads on circuit board. Clean and then use
     conductive Epoxy or paint or metal foil to restore.

  7. Worn or dirty pads on rubber keypad. Clean. If worn, use conductive
     paint or metal foil to restore.

  8. Cracked circuit board - can usually be repaired as these are usually
     single sided with big traces. Scrape off insulating coating and jumper
     breaks with fine wire and solder.

  9. Bad LED. If IR tester shows no output, remove LED and power it from a 9V
     battery in series with a 500 ohm resistor. If still no output, replace
     with readily available high power IR LED. Otherwise, check driver
     circuits.

 10. Bad IC - if it is a custom chip, forget it! Failure of the IC is usually
     quite unlikely.

     (The following is from Duane P Mantick:)

     An awful lot of IR remotes use IC's from the same or similar series. A
     common series comes from NEC and is the uPD1986C which, incidentally is
     called out in the NTE replacements book as an NTE1758. A lot of these
     chips are cheap and not too difficult to find, and are made in
     easy-to-work-with 14 or 16 pin DIP packages. Unless you have no
     soldering or desoldering skills, replacement isn't difficult.

There are a large variety of universal remotes available from $10-$100. For
general TV/VCR/cable use, the $10 variety are fine. However, the
preprogrammed variety will not provide special functions like programming of
a TV or VCR. Don't even think about going to the original manufacturer - they
will charge an arm and a leg (or more). However, places like MCM Electronics
do stock a variety of original remotes - prices range from $9 - $143 (Wow
$143, for just a stupid remote! It doesn't even have high definition sound or
anything exotic). The average price is around $40.

@node 14.13 "Problems with keypads or touchpanels"

Most common are moisture problems followed by physical damage:

Very often, a little overzealous cleaning results in moisture trapped inside
a not quite perfectly sealed membrane keypad or touchpanel.

First, of course, dry off the exterior as best you can. Any moisture that
seeped inside may be difficult to remove without surgery - which is
definitely not something you want to undertake as the long term reliability
will be compromised.

I would recommend waiting a while - a week may be required - for it to
totally dry out. You could also try confirming across the touchpad contacts
with an ohmmeter that there is still low resistance (even 10s of K ohms may
look like a button press). It is nearly impossible to speed up this process
without subjecting the device to conditions that may harm the device - heat
and/or vacuum. You possibly try something like isopropyl alcohol in the hope
that it will displace the water and dry quickly. I do not know if this will
be safe in every situation, however.

Of course, it is also possible that are other problems but I have seen these
things take a very long time to dry out.

However, significant damage - a membrane type touchpad is punctured - may
require replacement unless you can repair the internal wiring. The
connections are usually made with flex-cables which are difficult or
impossible to repair. See the section: @{"Repairing flexible printed cables" link "14.14"}
Damage to any membrane buttons may result in stuck buttons or improper
operation of other buttons.

It seems that more and more consumer devices from pocket cameras to laptop

repeated flexing. In addition, damage from moving circuit boards and modules
during servicing is all to common.

CAUTION: many devices like calculators have printed cables that use a
material that will not take solder and are glued rather than soldered at
their ends - the logic board and LCD panel, for example. Repair of problems
with the cables is virtually impossible. Take great care when working inside
of devices with this sort of cabling to prevent damage to the cables or their
termination.

Needless to say, repairing any kind of flex cable is a real pain. I have
succeeded by carefully scraping the plastic off with an Xacto knife and then
soldering fine wire (#30 gauge wire wrap for example) to the traces. This
presumes that the conductors on your cable will even take solder. I then
cover up the joints with a flexible sealer for electrical and mechanical
protection.

However, you need to make sure that the wire you use can be flexed or that
the joint is set up in such a way that the wire does not flex much - else you
will just end up with broken wires pretty quickly.

Soldering from end point to end point if possible may be preferable. Even
going to only one endpoint would reduce the risk of immediate damage and
reliability problems in the future.

With multiple traces broken or damaged, you are probably better off replacing
the cable entirely.

@node 15.1 "Classic ATT Touch Tone phone 'battlewagon' will not dial properly"

Typical symptoms are: everything works fine except erratic or no dialing. For
some buttons, dial tone would not go away. For others, tones would be
accepted but will be erratic and result in incorrect digits. Certain digits
may sound weak, wavery, or single frequency (rather than the proper DTMF dual
tones).

While the internal wiring of these old phones is intimidating, the basic tone
dialing circuitry is an amazing example of simplicity. About the only things
that fail yet still permit some tone generation are the pot core coils that
determine tone frequency. Therefore, this is the first thing to check.

There are two cores which each consist of two halves glued together. Breaks
seem to be a common problem due to both the age and the brittle cement used
on some revs of this model phone, and probably, as a result of rough
treatment when hanging up the handset, or dropping or throwing of the desk
phone.

These cores must be aligned before being glued back together. In addition,
there is an adjustment plug which may need to be tweaked. I align by ear as
follows: Put a known good tone dialing phone and the bad phone on the same
phone line. Momentarily depress the hook switches to silence the dial tone.
You will now have about 25 seconds before the nice polite operator recording
tells you how to make a call. Depending on which core is bad, depress either
an entire (same) row or column of buttons on both phones. (Adhesive tape is
handy to hold down the buttons unless you have four hands.) By depressing the
entire set of buttons, you are disabling the other tone generator so you hear
a pure tone. Without turning the fine adjustment plug (assuming it was not
disturbed; if it was, set it mid-range or the same as the one in the other
core), rotate the loose core top until a zero beat is obtained. As your
rotate the core, you will hear the pitch change. As it approaches the correct
setting, you will hear the tones beat against each other. When you are set
correctly, the pitches will be equal and the beat frequency will go to zero.
Mark the position of the core with a pen or pencil and then glue with Epoxy
or other general purpose adhesive (around the outside - not on the mating
surfaces as this will affect the tone frequencies). After the glue sets,
confirm and adjust the plug core if needed. These cores use a strange
triangular core tool - I made mine by filing down an aluminum roofing nail
(do not use a ferrous material).

These classic ATT Touch Tone phones are virtually indestructible. However,
broken cores (or actually, just broken joints on the cores) are common but
easily repaired once you know what to look for. Setting the tones by
referencing a known good phone seems to be a very reliable technique as the
zero beat permits an adjustment to better than .1%. Note that if the
reference phone is a more modern (and flimsy digital one), then pushing
multiple buttons may not work as it does with the old analog models. Setting
the frequency using the normal dual tones will work - it is just not as easy.

@node 15.2 "ATT classic dial phone will not dial"

I know, you haven't seen one of these in years, but I just had to throw this
in.

Most likely it was dropped - these phones simply do not seem to fail any
other way. When dropped, assuming there is no obvious damage, a little
plastic stop inside the dial mechanism which is on a pivot flips the wrong
way. This normally prevents dialing pulses from being generated when the dial
returns to its home position but when flipped, prevents dialing totally. It
is real easy to flip it back into place.

@node 15.3 "Jerrold 400 Cable Converter Problems"

The most common symptoms for these cable boxes relate to their not staying on
or acting erratically when the buttons are pressed. The causes are usually
quite simple:

  1. Cold solder joints around the power supply regulator ICs (on chassis
     heat sink).

  2. Dried up main filter capacitors - two large electrolytics in power
     supply on main board.

Be careful disassembling the main board from the chassis as at least one of
the regulator ICs clipped to the side of the chassis is insulated from this
heatsink and the insulation is easily damaged.

@node 15.4 "Original Nintendo console erratic or dead"

While the original Nintendo game machine is a couple of generations out of
date, many are still in use. And, hey, kids usually don't care.

The most common problem with these units is a worn or dirty cartridge
connector. In this case, the red power/status light will continue to flash
even after the RESET button is pressed with a game cartridge in place.
Replacements are available for about $9 from the sources listed at the end of
this document.

First, try another game cartridge - the one that is not working may just have
dirty contacts or may be defective. Clean the contacts with a Qtip moistened
with water followed by isopropyl alcohol. (The water will remove the sugar
from the candy that may have made its way onto the connector.)

To get inside, you first remove the 6 screws on the bottom and then about 12
screws which fasten the circuit board and shield to the bottom of the case.
(NOTE: there are two screws which are longer and silver colored - make sure
they get back to their original location when you put everything back
together.) Once all these screws are removed, the black connector can be slid
off the edge finger on the circuit board Inspect these connections - they
just may be a bit corroded or dirty. Use contact cleaner and/or a pencil
eraser and see if that makes any difference. Use contact cleaner on the dual
rows of fingers that connect to the game cartridge as well. A dental pick can
be used to gently spread the fingers apart ever so slightly and thus improve
the connection when the cartridge is inserted.

Even if this only makes a slight improvement - you can press down on the
cartridge and the machine will respond to the RESET button - you have
confirmed that the connector is indeed the problem. In many cases, just this
cleaning will result in reliable operation for a long time to come.

@node 16.1 "Determining belt type and size"

Belts are normally specified by their cross section - square, flat, round,
and their inside circumference (IC). The IC is used since it is virtually
impossible to accurately measure the diameter of a belt.

Assuming you cannot locate an actual part number, determine the type of belt;
square, flat, or round. If you do not have the old belt, this is usually
obvious from the pulleys. Most small belts (as opposed to V-belts on 1 HP
shop motors!) used in consumer electronic equipment are of square cross
section though flat types are sometimes found in the main drives of VCRs,
cassette/tape decks, and turntables (remember those?). Measure or estimate
the thickness.

The IC is always specified with the belt fully relaxed. This can be measured
by hooking the old belt on one end of a ruler and pulling it just tight
enough so that it more or less flattens out. Read off the length, then double
it for the IC. Get a new belt that is 5% or so smaller to account for the old
one be somewhat stretched out. Of course, if the belt broke, measurement is
real easy. Or, if you do not care about the old belt, just cut it and measure
the total length.

If the old belt decomposed into a slimy glob of jellatinous black goop or is
missing, you will need to use a string or fine wire around the appropriate
pulleys to determine the IC. Reduce this by 10-25% for the replacement. Very
often the match does not need to be exact in either thickness or length -
particularly for long thin belts. A common rubber band may in fact work just
as well for something like a tape counter!

However, there are cases where an exact match is critical - some VCRs and
belt driven turntables or tape decks do require an exact replacement for
certain drive belts but this is rare.

Some parts suppliers make determining replacement belts very easy with the
PRB system in which the part number fully codes the shape, size, and
thickness.

@node 16.2 "Interchangeability of components"

The question often arises: If I cannot obtain an exact replacement or if I
have a VCR, tape deck, or other equipment carcass gathering dust, or I just
have some extra parts left over from a previous project, can I substitute a
part that is not a precise match? Sometimes, this is simply desired to
confirm a diagnosis and avoid the risk of ordering an expensive replacement
and/or having to wait until it arrives.

For safety related items, the answer is generally NO - an exact replacement
part is needed to maintain the specifications within acceptable limits with
respect to line isolation, X-ray protection and to minimize fire hazards.
However, these components are not very common in audio equipment or other
consumer devices (other than TVs, monitors, and microwave ovens) except for
possibly in their power supply.

For other components, whether a not quite identical substitute will work
reliably or at all depends on many factors. Some designs are so carefully
optimized for a particular part's specifications that an identical
replacement is the way to return performance to factory new levels.

Here are some guidelines:

  1. Fuses - exact same current rating and at least equal voltage rating. I
     have often soldered a normal 3AG size fuse onto a smaller blown 20 mm
     long fuse as a substitute. Also, they should be the same type - slow
     blow only if originally specified. A fuse with a faster response time
     may be used but it may blow when no faults actually exist.

  2. Resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, switches, trimpots, lamps and
     LEDs, and other common parts - except for those specifically marked as
     safety-critical - substitution as long as the replacement part fits and
     specifications are met should be fine. It is best to use the same type -
     metal film resistor, for example. But for testing, even this is not a
     hard and fast rule and a carbon resistor should work just fine.

  3. Potentiometers - user knobs usually control one or more of these. There
     are four considerations in locating a suitable replacement: resistance,
     and taper, power rating, configuration, and mechanical fit.
     Configuration refers to the number of ganged pots, concentric knobs,
     etc. Matching this from your junk box may prove to be the toughest
     challenge! Many of the controls for audio equipment use what is known as
     an 'audio taper'. This means that the resistance change with knob
     rotation is not linear but is designed to produce a uniform incremental
     change in perceived volume, for example. Replacement with a linear taper
     pot will squish all of the effect towards one end of the range but it
     will still work. If measuring the resistance of a (good) potentiometer
     with its wiper set in the middle results in significantly different
     readings from center to each end, it is most likely an audio taper pot
     (though some other weird taper or other peculiarity is possible).

  4. Rectifiers - many are of these are high efficiency and/or fast recovery
     types. Replacements should have equal or better PRV, If, and Tr
     specifications. For line rectifiers, 1N400x types can usually be used.

  5. Transistors and thyristors (except power supply choppers) - substitutes
     will generally work as long as their specifications meet or exceed those
     of the original. For testing, it is usually ok to use types that do not
     quite meet all of these as long as the breakdown voltage and maximum
     current ratings are not exceeded. However, performance may not be quite
     as good. For power types, make sure to use a heatsink.

  6. Switching power supply transistors - exact replacement is generally best
     but switchmode transistors that have specifications that are at least as
     good will work in many cases. See the documents on "TV", "monitor", and
     "SMPS" repair for further info.

  7. Audio and erase heads - may be possible if the mountings are reasonably
     compatible. However, there could be other unknowns like coil impedance
     and drive requirements. The connectors are not likely to be similar
     either. There are usually significant differences in head configuration
     and mounting arrangement between 2 head, 3 head, and autoreverse
     cassette or open reel tape decks.

  8. Motors - small PM motors may be substituted if they fit physically. Make
     sure you install for the correct direction of rotation (determined by
     polarity). Capstan motors - especially the direct drive type - are
     probably not interchangeable. However, generic speed regulated cassette
     drive motors are available.

  9. Sensors - many are sufficiently similar to permit substitution.

 10. Power transformers - in some cases, these may be sufficiently similar
     that a substitute will work. However, make sure you test for compatible
     output voltages to avoid damage to the regulator(s) and rest of the
     circuitry. Transformer current ratings as well as the current
     requirements of the equipment are often unknown, however.

 11. Belts, tires, and pinch rollers - a close match may be good enough at
     least to confirm a problem or to use until the replacements arrives.

 12. Mechanical parts like screws, flat and split washers, C- and E-clips,
     and springs - these can often be salvaged from another unit.

The following are usually custom parts and substitution of something from
your junk box is unlikely to be successful even for testing: SMPS (power
supply) transformers, interstage coils or transformers, microcontrollers,
other custom programmed chips, display modules, and entire power supplies
unless identical.
