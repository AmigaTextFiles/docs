@node 2 "Chapter 2 Introduction"

2.1) Compact discs and the digital audio revolution

The transformation of CD players and CDROMs from laboratory curiosities to
the economical household appliances that have revolutionized the musical
recording industry and have made possible multimedia computing depend on the
availability of two technologies: low power low cost solid state laserdiodes
and mass produced large scale integrated circuits. Without these, a CD player
using 1960's technology would be the size of dishwasher!

Most of us take all of this for granted rarely giving any thought to the
amazing interplay of precision optics and complex electronics - at least
until something goes wrong. The purpose of this document is to provide enough
background on CD technology and troubleshooting guidance so that anyone who
is reasonably handy whether a homeowner, experimenter, hobbiest, tinkerer, or
engineer, can identify and repair many problems with CD players and possibly
laserdisc players, CDROM drives, and optical storage drives as well.

Even if you have trouble changing a light bulb and do not know which end of a
soldering iron is the one to avoid, reading through this document will enable
you to be more knowledgeable about your CD player. Then, if you decide to
have it professionally repaired, you will have a better chance of recognizing
incompetence or down right dishonesty when dealing with the service
technician. For example, a bad laser is not the most likely problem - it is
actually fairly far down on the list of typical faults. There - you learned
something already!

Most of the information in this document applies to the CD players in
component stereo systems, compact stereos, boomboxes, car units and
portables, as well as CDROM drives. The primary differences will relate to
how the disc is loaded - portables usually are top loaders without a loading
drawer.

However, as a result of the level of miniaturization required for portables
and to a lesser extent, CDROM drives, everything is tiny and most or all of
the electrical components are surface mounted on both sides of an often
inaccessible printed circuit board with the entire unit assembled using
screws with a mind of their own and a desire to be lost.

Laserdisc players and optical disk storage units have much in common with CD
players with respect to the mechanical components and front-end electronics.
Therefore, the information contained in this document can represent a
starting point for their troubleshooting as well.

Many common problems with CD players can be corrected without the need for
the service manual or the use of sophisticated test equipment. The types of
problems in a CD player can be classified as:

  1. Mechanical - dirt, lubrication, wear, deteriorated rubber parts,
     dirty/bad limit switches, physical damage.

  2. Electrical Adjustments - coarse tracking, fine tracking, focus, laser
     power. However, some CD players no longer have some of these
     adjustments.

  3. Electrical Component Failure. These are rare except for power surge
     (storm and lightning strike) related damage which if you are lucky will
     only blow out components in the power supply.

You can often repair a CD player which is faulty due to (1) or (2) except for
laser power which I would not attempt except as a last resort without a
service manual and/or proper instrumentation if needed - improper adjustment
can ruin the laser. If discs are recognized at all or even if the unit only
focuses correctly, then laser power is probably ok. While the laserdiodes can
and do fail, don't assume that every CD player problem is laser related. In
fact, only a small percentage (probably under 10%) are due to a failure of
the laserdiode or its supporting circuitry. Mechanical problems such as dirt
and lubrication are most common followed by the need for electrical (servo)
adjustments.

Category (3) failures in the power supply can also be repaired fairly easily.
Most other electrical failures would be difficult to locate without the
service manual, test equipment, and a detailed understanding and familiarity
with audio CD technology. However, you might get lucky.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2) Repair or replace?

While CD players with new convenience features are constantly introduced, the
basic function of playing a CD has not changed significantly in 15 years.
None of the much hyped 'advancements' such as digital filters, oversampling,
one bit D/As and such are likely to make any difference in the listening
pleasure of most mortals. Most people who care, do so only because they are
more concerned with the technology than the musical experience. Most of these
so called advances were done at least in part to reduce costs - not
necessarily to improve performance.

Therefore, unless you really do need a 250 disc CD changer with a remote
control that has more buttons than a B777 cockpit and 2000 track
programmability, a 10 year old CD player will sound just as good and repair
may not be a bad idea. Many older CD players are built more solidly than
those of today. Even some new high-end CD players may be built around a
mostly plastic optical deck and flimsy chassis.

If you need to send or take the CD player or CDROM drive to a service center,
the repair could easily exceed the cost of a new unit. Service centers may
charge up to $50 or more for providing an initial estimate of repair costs
but this will usually be credited toward the total cost of the repair (of
course, they may just jack this up to compensate for their bench time).

If you can do the repairs yourself, the equation changes dramatically as your
parts costs will be 1/2 to 1/4 of what a professional will charge and of
course your time is free. The educational aspects may also be appealing. You
will learn a lot in the process. Thus, it may make sense to repair that
bedraggled old boombox after all.

@node 3.1 "General Introduction to CD Technology"

Information on a compact disc is encoded in minute 'pits' just under the
label side of the CD. The CD itself is stamped in much the same way as an old
style LP but under much more stringent conditions - similar to the conditions
maintained in the clean room of a semiconductor wafer fab. The CD pressing is
then aluminum coated in a vacuum chamber and the label side is spin-coated
with a protective plastic resin and printed with the label.

CD-Rs - recordable CDs use a slightly different construction. CD-R blanks are
prestamped with a spiral guide groove and then coated with an ablatable layer
followed by a gold film, resin, and label. The ablatable layer appears
greenish. Recording blows holes in the ablatable layer which permits the
laser beam to reflect off of the gold underneath.

The newest variation - DVDs or Digital Versatile Disks (or Digital Video
Disks depending on who you listen to) - implement a number of incremental but
very significant improvements in technology which in total add up to a
spectacular increase in information density - almost 10:1 for the same size
disc. These include higher frequency laser (670 or shorter visible
wavelength), closer track spacing, better encoding, and a double sided disc.
According to early reports on the final specifications, DVDs will be able to
store 8 times the audio of current CDs at a higher sampling rate and bit
resolution, 2 hours of MPEG encoded high quality movies, and all kinds of
other information. Raw data capacity is somewhere between 5 and 10 GBytes.

The remainder of this document limits discussion to the standard CD format.
However, many of the basic principles apply to these newer formats as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node 3.2 "CD information storage and playback"

The actual information to be recorded undergoes a rather remarkable
transformation from raw audio (or digital data) before it becomes microscopic
pits. For audio, this process starts with prefiltering to remove frequencies
above 20 KHz and analog-to-digital conversion at a sampling rate of 44.1 K
samples per second for both stereo channels (88.2 K/s total). Note that in
most cases of commercial or professional CDs, the original music has been
recorded on multitrack digital tape at 48 K sample/second. All mixing and
premastering operations are done at this sampling rate. The final step is
conversion through resampling (sample rate conversion including sophisticated
interpolation) to 44.1 Ks/second.

This is followed by sophisticated coding of the resulting 16 bit twos
complement samples (interleaved between L and R channels) for the purpose of
error detection and correction. Finally, the data is converted to a form
suitable for the recording medium by 8-14 modulation and then written on a
master disk using a precision laser cutting lathe (or now with CD-R, a modest
priced CD recorder).

Like a phonograph record, the information is recorded in a continuous spiral.
However, with a CD, this track (groove or row of pits - not to be confused
with the selections on a music CD) starts near the center of the CD and
spirals (counterclockwise when viewed from the label side) toward the outer
edge. The readout is through the 1.2 mm polycarbonate disc substrate to he
aluminized information layer just beneath the label. The total length of the
spiral track for a 74 minute disc is over 5,000 meters or 3 miles in over
20,000 revolutions of the disc!

A series of electroplating, stripping, and reproduction steps then produce
multiple 'stampers' which are actually used to press the discs.

The digital encoding for error detection and correction is called the Cross
Interleave Reed Soloman Code or CIRC. To describe this as simply as possible,
the CIRC code consists of two parts: interleaving of data so that a dropout
or damage will be spread over enough physical area (hopefully) to be
reconstructed and a CRC like error correcting code. Taken together, these two
techniques are capable of some remarkable error correction. The assumption
here is that most errors will occur in bursts as a result of dust specs,
scratches, imperfections such as pinholes in the aluminum coating, etc. For
example, the codes are powerful enough to totally recover a burst error of
greater than 4,000 consecutive bits - about 2.5 mm on the disc. With full
error correction implemented (this is not always the case with every CD
player), it is possible to put a piece of 2 mm tape radially on the disc or
drill a 2 mm hole in the disc and have no audio degradation. Some test CDs
have just this type of defect introduced deliberately.

Two approaches are taken with uncorrectable errors: interpolation and muting.
If good samples surround bad ones, then linear or higher order interpolation
may be used to reconstruct them. If too much data has been lost, the audio is
smoothly muted for a fraction of a second. Depending on where these errors
occur in relation to the musical context, even these drastic measures may be
undetectable to the human ear.

Note that the error correction for CDROM formats is even more involved than
for CD audio as any bit error is unacceptable. This is one of many reasons
why it is generally impossible to convert an audio CD player into a CDROM
drive. However, since nearly all CDROM drives are capable of playing music
CDs, much can be determined about the nature of a problem by first testing a
CDROM drive with a music CD.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 3.3 "CD (disc) construction"

The information layer as mentioned above utilizes 'pits' as the storage
mechanism. Pits are depressions less than .2 um in depth (1/4 wavelength of
the 780 nm laser light taking into consideration the actual wavelength inside
the polycarbonate plastic). Thus, the reflected beam is 180 degrees out of
phase with incident beam and cancels making for high contrast edges and good
signal to noise ratio. Everything that is not a pit is 'land'. Pits are about
.5 um wide and come in increments of .278 um as the basic length of a bit on
the information layer of the disc.

Each byte of the processed information is converted into a 14 bit run length
limited code taken from a codebook (lookup table) such that there are no
fewer than 2 or more than 10 consecutive 0s between 1s. By then making the 1s
transitions from pit to land or land to pit, the minimum length of any
feature on the disc is no less than 3*x and no more than 11*x where x is .278
um. This is called Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation - EFM. Thus the length of a
pit ranges from .833 to 3.054 um.

Each 14 bit code word has 3 additional sync and low frequency suppression
bits added for a total of 17 bits representing each 8 bit byte. Since a
single bit is .278 um, a byte is then represented in a linear space of 4.72
um. EFM in conjunction with the sync bits assure that the average signal has
no DC component and that there are enough edges to reliably reconstruct the
clock for data readout. These words are combined into 588 bit frames. Each
frame contains 24 bytes of audio data (6 samples of L+R at 16 bits) and 8
bits of information used to encode (across multiple frames) information like
the time, track, index, etc:


      Sync                    (24 + 3).
      Control and display     (14 + 3).
      Data                    (12 * 2 * (14 + 3)).
      Error correction        ( 4 * 2 * (14 + 3)).
                              --------------------
                              588 total bits/frame

A block, which is made up of 98 consecutive frames, is the smallest unit
which may be addressed on an audio CD and corresponds to a time of 1/75 of a
second. Two bits in the information byte are currently defined. These are
called P and Q. P serves a kind of global sync function indicating start and
end of selections, time in between selections, and so forth. Q bits
accumulated into one word made of a portion of the 98 possible bits encodes
the time, track and index number, as well as many other possible functions
depending where on the disc it is located, what kind of disc this is, and so
forth.

Information on a CD is recorded at a Constant Linear Velocity - CLV. This is
both good and bad. For CD audio - 1X speed - this CLV is about 1.2 meters per
second. CLV permits packing the maximum possible information on a disc since
it is recorded at the highest density regardless of location. However, for
high speed access, particularly for CDROM drives, it means there is a need to
rapidly change the speed of rotation of the disc when seeking between inner
and outer tracks. Of course, there is no inherent reason why for CDROMs, the
speed could not be kept constant meaning that data transfer rate would be
higher for the outer tracks than the inner ones, but this is, as far as I
know, not implemented.

Note that unlike a turntable, the instantaneous speed of the spindle is not
what determines the pitch of the audio signal. There is extensive buffering
in RAM inside the player used both as a FIFO to smooth out data read off of
the disc to ease the burden on the spindle servo as well as to provide
temporary storage for intermediate results during decoding and error
correction. Pitch (in the music sense) is determined by the data readout
clock - a crystal oscillator usually which controls the D/A and LSI chipset
timing. The only way to adjust pitch is to vary this clock. Some high-end
players include a pitch adjustment. The precision of the playback of the any
CD player is determined by a high quality quartz oscillator so that wow and
flutter - key measures of the quality of phonograph turntables - are so small
as to be undetectable. Ultimately, the sampling frequency of 44.1 K samples
per second determines the audio output. For this, the average bit rate from
the disc is 4.321 M bits per second.

Tracks are spaced 1.6 micrometers apart - a track pitch of 1.6 um. Thus a 12
cm disc has over 20,000 tracks for its 74 minutes of music. Of course, unlike
a hard disk and like a phonograph record, it is really one spiral track over
3 miles long! However, as noted above, the starting point is near the center
of the disc. The width of the pits on a track is actually about .5 um. The
focused laser beam is less than 2 um at the pits. Compare this to an LP: A
long long playing LP might have a bit over 72 minutes of music on two sides
or 36 minutes per side. (Most do not achieve anywhere near this much music
since the groove spacing needs to vary depending on how much bass content the
music has and wide grooves occupy more space.) At 33-1/3 rpm, this is just
over 1,200 grooves in about 4 inches compared to 20,000 tracks on a CD in a
space of just over 1.25 inches! The readout styles for an LP has a tip radius
of perhaps 2 to 3 mils (50 to 75 um).

@endnode
@node 3.4 "And you thought driving on a narrow winding country road was tough!"

To put the required CD player servo system performance into perspective, here
is an analogy:

At a constant linear velocity of about 1.2 meters per second, the required
tracking precision is astounding: Proper tracking of a CD is equivalent to
driving down a 10 foot wide highway (assuming an acceptable tracking error of
less than +/- .35 um) more than 3,200 miles for one second of play or over
14,400,000 miles for the entire disc without accidentally crossing lanes!
Actually, it is worse than this: focus must be maintained all this time to
better than 1 um as well (say, +/- .5 um). So, it is more like piloting a
aircraft down a 10 foot wide flight path at an altitude of about 12 miles (4
mm typical focal length objective lens) with an altitude error of less than
+/- 7 feet! All this while the target track below you is moving both
horizontally (CD and spindle runout of .35 mm) 1 mile and vertically (disc
warp and spindle wobble of up to 1 mm) 3 miles per revolution! In addition,
you are trying to ignore various types of garbage (smudges, fingerprints,
fibers, dust, etc.) below you which on this scale have mountain sized
dimensions. Sorry for the mixed units. My apologies to the rest of the world
where the proper units are used for everything).

The required precision is unbelievable but true using mass produced
technology that dates to the late 1970s. And, consider that a properly
functioning CD player is remarkably immune to small bumps and vibration -
more so than an old style turntable. All based on the reflection of a
fraction of a mW of invisible laser light!

Of course, this is just another day in the entertainment center for the CD
player's servo systems. Better hope that our technological skills are never
lost - a phonograph record can be played using the thorn from a rosebush
using a potter's wheel for a turntable. Just a bit more technology is needed
to read and interpret the contents of a CD!

@endnode
@node 3.5 "CD optical pickup operating principles"

The purpose of the optical pickup in a CD player, CDROM drive, or optical
disk drive, is to recover digital data from the encoded pits at the
information layer of the optical medium. For CD players, the resulting
datastream is converted into high fidelity sound. For CDROMs or other optical
storage devices, it may be interpreted as program code, text, audio or video
multimedia, color photographs, or other types of digital data.

The following description assumes a 3 beam optical pickup - the most common
type. (This is slightly simplified with some minor omissions for ease of
understanding.) Most of the basic principles are similar for single beam CD
pickups and other digital optical drives.

It is often stated that the laser beam in a CD player is like the stylus of a
phonograph turntable. While this is a true statement, the actual magnitude of
this achievement is usually overlooked. Consider that the phonograph stylus
is electromechanical. Stylus positioning - analogous to tracking and focus in
an optical pickup - is based on the stylus riding in the record's grooves
controlled by the suspension of the pickup cartridge and tone arm. The analog
audio is sensed most often by electromagnetic induction produced by the
stylus's minute movements wiggling a magnet within a pair of sense coils.

The optical pickup must perform all of these functions without any mechanical
assistance from the CD. It is guided only be a fraction of a mW of laser
light and a few milligrams of silicon based electronic circuitry.
Furthermore, the precision involved is easily more than 2 orders of magnitude
finer compared to a phonograph. Sophisticated servo systems maintain focus
and tracking to within a fraction of a micrometer of optimal. ( 1 um is equal
to 1/25,400 of an inch). Data is read out by detecting the difference in
depth of pits and lands of 1/4 wavelength of laser light (about .15 um in the
CD)!

The laser beam is generated by a solid state laser diode emitting at 780 nm
(near IR). Optical power from the laserdiode is no more than a couple of mW
and exits in a wedge shaped beam with a typical divergence of 10x30 degrees.
A collimating lens converts this into a parallel beam which then passes
through a diffraction grating which splits the beam into a main beam and two
side beams. (The higher order beams are not used). Note that the diffraction
grating is used to generate multiple beams, not for its more common function
of splitting up light into its constituent colors. The side beams are used
for tracking and straddle the track which is being read. (The tracking servo
maintains this centering by keeping the amplitude of the two return beams
equalized.) Next, the laser beam passes through a cylindrical-convex lens
which is used in conjunction with the focus servo. (As a result of this lens,
the shape of the return beam changes as focal distance is adjusted and this
is sensed to maintain correct focus to within a fraction of a um.) The laser
beam then passes through a beam splitter prism which redirects the return
beam to the photodiode array. A turning mirror or prism then reflects the
laser light up to the objective lens and focus/tracking actuators.

The objective lens is similar in many ways to a high quality microscope
objective lens. It is mounted on a platform which provides for movement in
two directions. The actuators operate similarly to the voice coils in
loudspeakers. Fixed permanent magnets provide the magnetic fields which the
coils act upon. The focus actuator moves the lens up and down. The tracking
actuator moves the coil in and out with respect to the disc center.

The collimated laser beam (including the 2 side beams) passes through the
objective lens and is focused to diffraction limited spots on the information
- pits - layer of the disc.

The reflected beam retraces the original path up until the beam splitter at
which point it is diverted to the photodiode array. At the photodiode array,
the resulting image of the disc's information layer is used for servo control
of focus and tracking and for data recovery. In essence, the pickup is an
electronically steered and stabilized microscope which is extracting
information from tracks 1/20 the width of a human red blood cell while flying
along at a linear velocity of 1.2 meters/second!

@node 4.1 "General CD player placement considerations"

Proper care of a CD player does not require much. Following the
recommendations below will assure peak performance and long life, and
minimize repairs.

   o Locate the CD player in a cool location. While the CD player is not a
     significant heat producer, keeping it cool will reduce wear and tear on
     the internal components and assure a long trouble free life.

   o Don't locate CD players in dusty locations or areas of high (tobacco)
     smoke or cooking grease vapors. I cannot force you to quit smoking, but
     it is amazing how much disgusting difficult to remove brown grime is
     deposited on sensitive electronic equipment in short order from this
     habit.

   o Make sure all audio connections are tight and secure to minimize
     intermittent or noisy sound.

   o Finally, store CDs away from heat. The polycarbonate plastic used to
     mold CDs is quite sturdy but high temperatures will eventually take
     their toll. Return them to their jewel cases or other protective
     container when not being played.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.2 "Preventive Maintenance (PM)"

You no doubt have heard that a CD should be cleaned and checked periodically.
"Purchase our extended warranty" says the salesperson "because CD players are
very delicate and require periodic alignment". For the most part, this is
nonsense. CD players, despite the astonishing precision of the optical picku
@endnodep
@node are remarkably robust "Optical alignment is almost never needed for a"
component CD player and is rarely required even for portable or automotive
units.

An occasional internal inspection and cleaning is not a bad idea but not
nearly as important as for a VCR. Realistically, you are not going to do any
PM anyway. So, just be aware of the types of symptoms that would be
indications of the need for cleaning or other preventive or corrective
maintenance - erratic loading, need to convince the CD player to cooperate
and play a disc, audio noise, skipping, sticking, taking longer than usual to
recognize a disc or complete a search.

Of course, acute symptoms like refusal to play or open the door is a sign of
the need for emergency treatment. This still may mean that a thorough
cleaning is all that is needed.

I generally don't consider CD lens cleaning discs to be of much value for
preventive maintenance since they may just move the crud around. However, for
pure non-greasy dust (no tobacco smoke and no cooking grease), they probably
do not hurt and may do a good enough job to put off a proper cleaning for a
while longer.

If you follow the instructions in the section:
@{"General inspection, cleaning, and Lubrication" link "6.8"}, there is minimal risk to the CD
player. However, don't go overboard. If any belts are in good condition (by
appearance and stretch test), just clean them or leave them alone. Except for
the Sony drawer loading mechanism, belts are rarely as much of a problem as in
VCRs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.3 "CD protection and handling"

Although CDs are considerably more tolerant of abuse than LPs, some
precautions are still needed to assure long life. Also, despite the fact that
only one side is played, serious damage to either side can cause problems
during play or render the CD totally useless.

It is important that the label side be protected from major scratches which
could penetrate to the information layer. Even with the sophisticated error
correction used on the CD, damage to this layer, especially if it runs
parallel to the tracks, can make the CD unusable. The CD is read by focusing
a laser beam through the bottom 1.2 mm of polycarbonate. As a result of the
design of the optical system used in the pickup, at the bottom surface, the
beam diameter is about 1 mm and thus small scratches appear out of focus and
in many cases are ignored and do not cause problems. At the information layer
with the pits, the beam diameter has been reduced to under 2 um. Still,
scratches running parallel to the tracks are more problematic and can cause
the optical pickup to get stuck repeating a track, jumping forward or back a
few seconds, or creating noise or other problems on readout. In severe cases,
the CD may be unusable especially if the damage is in the directory area.

This is why the recommended procedure for cleaning a CD is to use soap and
water (no harsh solvents which may damage the polycarbonate or resin
overcoat) and clean in a radial direction (center to edge, NOT in the
direction of the tracks as you would with an LP. While on the subject of CD
care, CDs should always be returned to their original container for storage
and not left out on the counter where they may be scratched. However, if
there is a need to put one down for a moment, the label side is to be
preferred since scratches have no effect on performance so long as they do
not penetrate to the storage layer below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.4 "CD cleaning"

Use a soft cloth, tissue, or paper towel moistened with water and mild
detergent if needed. Wipe from center to edge - NOT in a circular motion as
recommended for an LP. NEVER use any strong solvents. Even stubborn spots
will eventually yield to your persistence. Washing under running water is
fine as well.

Gently dry with a lint free cloth. Do not rub or use a dry cloth to clean as
any dirt particles will result in scratches. Polycarbonate is tough but don't
expect it to survive everything. Very fine scratches are not usually a
problem, but why press your luck?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.5 "Rental or library CD considerations"

Unlike old or worn video tapes, it is unlikely that a 'bad' CD could damage
your player. If the borrowed CD is dirty, clean it as described in the
section: @{"CD cleaning" link "4.4"} If it is badly scratched, the worst that will happen
is that it will sound bad - skipping and audible noise. No damage to your
player will result. However, if the CD is cracked or broken (this is really
difficult to do but I have gotten cracked CDs from public libraries), don't
even attempt to load it - a broken edge could catch on the lens and ruin the
optical pickup entirely.

@node 4.6 "Repairing a scratched CD"

So your five year old decided that your favorite CD would make nice frisbee -
didn't really know much about aerodynamics, did he?

Now it sounds like a poor excuse for a 78 rpm record. What to do?

There seem to be about as many ways of fixing scratches on CDs as producing
them in the first place. However, they fall into 3 classes of techniques:

  1. Mild abrasives: plastic or furniture polish, Brasso metal polish,
     toothpaste. These will totally remove minor scratches.

  2. Fillers: turtle wax, car wax, furniture wax. Apply over the whole disc
     and buff out with a lint free cloth. Filling larger scratches should be
     fairly effective but the disc will be more prone to damage in the future
     due to the soft wax.

  3. Blowtorch: at least one person who claims to have worked for several
     years in a used CD store swears by this technique. He uses a pencil type
     pocket butane torch and with great dexterity fuses the surface layer
     (polycarbonate) of the disc so that scratches and unsightly blemishes -
     well - melt away.

As with cleaning a CD, when applying or rubbing any of these materials, wipe
from the center to the outside edge. A CD player can generally track across
scratches that are perpendicular to its path reasonable well, but not those
that run the parallel to the tracks.

A mild abrasive will actually remove the scratch entirely if it is minor
enough. This is probably more effective where the surface has been scuffed or
abraded rather than deeply scratched.

Wax-like materials will fill in the space where the scratch is if the
abrasive was not successful. Even deep scratches may succumb to this
approach.

A combination of (1) and (2) may be most effective.

Exorbitantly priced versions of these materials are available specifically
marketed for repair of CDs. However, the common abrasives and waxes should
work about as well.

I cannot comment on the use of the blowtorch or how many years of practice is
required to get you CD repair license with this technique.

@node 4.7 "CD enhancers"

The process of reading a CD is digital. I have seen and heard advertisements
for sonic rings or special magic markers to improve the quality of the
digital audio reproduction. This is total bunk. Don't waste your money. These
products do nothing beyond depleting your pocketbook - and enhancing those of
the vendors.

@endnode
@node 5.1 "Safety"

While there are far fewer potential dangers involved in servicing a CD player
compared to a TV, monitor, or microwave oven, some minimal precautions are
still required when working with the cover removed:

   o Electrical: There may be a few exposed electrically live parts from the
     power line, usually around the power cord entrance, power transformer,
     and on/off switch. If there are, tape them over or cover them somehow so
     you need not be concerned with a low tech shock! Unless you are
     troubleshooting a primary side power supply problem, there will be no
     need to go near the AC line.

   o Laser: The laser in a CD player is infra red, IR - 780 nm - border of
     visible range but for all intents and purposes invisible. However, it is
     very low power (under 1mW) and due to the optics, extremely unlikely
     that you could be in any danger. Nonetheless, don't go out of your way
     to look closely into the lens while the unit is on! (NOTE: there is
     usually a very low (in appearance) intensity emission from the laser
     which appears deep red. It will be visible as just a spot the size of
     the period at the end of this sentence when the lens is viewed from an
     oblique angle. This may be a spurious emission in the red part of the
     spectrum or just your eye's response to the near IR energy of the main
     beam. In either case, do not be mislead into thinking that the laser is
     weak as a result of noticing this. The main beam is up to 10,000 times
     more intense! Take care. However, the red dot is an excellent indication
     that the laser is being powered and probably functional, though it is no
     guarantee of the later. You really need a laser power meter or at least
     an IR detector to confirm the existence of a laser beam.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.2 "Troubleshooting tips"

Many problems have simple solutions. Don't immediately assume that your
problem is some combination of esoteric complex convoluted failures. For a CD
player, it may just be a bad belt or dirty lens. Try to remember that the
problems with the most catastrophic impact on operation (a CD player that
will not play past track 6) usually have the simplest solutions (the gears
that move the optical pickup need lubrication). The kinds of problems that we
would like to avoid at all costs are the ones that are intermittent or
difficult to reproduce: the occasional audio noise or skipping or a CD player
that refuses to play classical CDs (depending on your tastes!) of music
composed between the years 1840 and 1910.

When attempting to diagnose problems with a CDROM drive, start by trying to
get it to play an audio CD. Data readback is more critical since the error
correction needs to be perfect. However, with audio playback functional, all
of the optical pickup and most of the servo systems and front-end electronics
must be working. A CDROM drive which cannot even play a music CD will have no
chance of loading Windows 95.

If you get stuck, sleep on it. Sometimes, just letting the problem bounce
around in your head will lead to a different more successful approach or
solution. Don't work when you are really tired - it is both dangerous and
mostly non-productive (or possibly destructive).

Whenever working on precision equipment, make copious notes and diagrams. You
will be eternally grateful when the time comes to reassemble the unit. Most
connectors are keyed against incorrect insertion or interchange of cables,
but not always. Apparently identical screws may be of differing lengths or
have slightly different thread types. Little parts may fit in more than one
place or orientation. Etc. Etc.

Pill bottles, film canisters, and plastic ice cube trays come in handy for
sorting and storing screws and other small parts after disassembly.

Select a work area which is well lighted and where dropped parts can be
located - not on a deep pile shag rug. Something like a large plastic tray
with a slight lip may come in handy as it prevents small parts from rolling
off of the work table. The best location will also be relatively dust free
and allow you to suspend your troubleshooting to eat or sleep or think
without having to pile everything into a cardboard box for storage.

Another consideration is ESD - Electro-Static Discharge. The electronic
components in CD players, CDROM drives, and similar devices, are vulnerable
to ESD. There is no need to go overboard but taking reasonable precautions
like not wearing clothing made of wool that tends to generate static. When
working on component CD and laserdisc players, get into the habit of touching
a ground like the metal chassis before touching any circuit components. The
use of an antistatic wrist strap would be further insurance.

A basic set of precision hand tools will be all you need to disassemble a CD
player and perform most adjustments. However, these do not need to be
expensive. Needed tools include a selection of Philips and straight blade
screwdrivers, needlenose pliers, wire cutters, tweezers, and dental picks. A
jeweler's screwdriver set is a must particularly if you are working on a
portable CD player or CDROM drive. For adjustments, a miniature (1/16" blade)
screwdriver with a non-metallic tip is desirable both to prevent the presence
of metal from altering the electrical properties of the circuit and to
minimize the possibility of shorting something from accidental contact with
the circuitry.

You should not need any CD specific tools except in the unlikely event you
get into optical alignment in which case the service manual will detail what
tools and special rigs are needed.

A low power fine tip soldering iron and fine rosin core solder will be needed
if you should need to disconnect any soldered wires (on purpose or by
accident) or replace soldered components.

For thermal or warmup problems, a can of 'cold spray' or 'circuit chiller'
(they are the same) and a heat gun or blow dryer come in handy to identify
components whose characteristics may be drifting with temperature. Using the
extension tube of the spray can or making a cardboard nozzle for the heat gun
can provide very precise control of which components you are affecting.

an Introduction" as well as other documents available at this site.

@node 5.3 "Test equipment"

Don't start with the electronic test equipment, start with some analytical
thinking. Many problems associated with consumer electronic equipment do not
require a schematic (though one may be useful). The majority of problems with
CD are mechanical and can be dealt with using nothing more than a good set of
precision hand tools; some alcohol, degreaser, contact cleaner, light oil and
grease; and your powers of observation (and a little experience). Your built
in senses and that stuff between your ears represents the most important test
equipment you have.

A DMM or VOM is necessary for checking of power supply voltages and testing
of sensors, LEDs, switches, and other small components. This does not need to
be expensive but since you will be depending on its readings, reliability is
important. Even a relatively inexpensive DMM from Radio Shack will be fine
for most repair work.

For servo and other electronic problems, an oscilloscope will be useful.
However, it does not need to be fancy. A 10 to 20 MHz dual trace scope with a
set of 10X probes will be more than adequate for all but the most esoteric
troubleshooting of CD players and CDROM drives.

To determine if the laserdiode is working properly, a laser power meter is
very useful. Such a device is expensive but is often essential to properly
and safely adjust laser power on many CD players and CDROM drives. However,
for many problems, simply knowing that an IR laser beam is being emitted is
enough. For this, the simple device described in the section: "IR detector
circuit" is more than adequate. Alternatively, an inexpensive IR detector
card or even some camcorders can perform the same function.

A stereo amplifier and loudspeakers is essential to allow your most important
piece of audio test equipment to function effectively - your ears. A lot can
be determined by listening to the audio output to distinguish among dirt,
lubrication, servo, control, and other mechanical or electronic problems. I
would caution against the use of headphones as a sudden burst of noise could
blow your eardrums and spoil your entire day.

For testing of optical pickups, some additional equipment will be needed.
However, this will be detailed in the section: @{"Testing the optical pickup" link "10.7"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.4 "Test CDs"

An inexpensive test CD is nice to have just to be able to play known
frequencies and volume levels. However, it is not essential - any half decent
CD will work just fine for most tests. For many players, even an old CDROM
disc will be adequate to diagnose startup problems. However, to fully
exercise the limits of the player, a disc with a full 74 minutes of music
will be needed - Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is a good choice (even if you are
not into classical music) since it is usually very close (or sometimes
slightly over) this length of time.

Keep those old demo CDs or even obsolete CDROM discs - they can be used for
testing purposes. Where an optical deck has a servo problem, the disc will
end up spinning out of control. Stopping this suddenly may result is the CD
scraping itself against the drawer or or base of the deck and getting
scratched. Therefore, some 'garbage' discs are always handy for testing
purposes.

To evaluate tracking and error correction performance, any CD can be turned
into a test CD with multiple width strips of black tape, a felt tip marker,
or even a hand drill! In fact, some professional test discs are made in
exactly this manner.

-----------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.5 "Getting inside a CD player or CDROM drive"

WARNING: you will void the warranty, if any. You may make the problem worse -
much worse. If the player partially worked, it may no longer even recognize
the disc directory. You may accidentally damage parts that were perfectly
fine. If you should decide to then have the unit professionally serviced, you
may find that the shop simply refuses to touch it if they suspect your
tampering. There is nothing worse than having to undo 'fixes' introduced by a
well intentioned do-it-yourselfer where the state of the player is now a
total unknown. At best you will be charged for this effort on a time and
materials basis. It may be very costly. It may not be worth the expensive.

A CD player still under warranty should probably be returned for service for
any covered problems except those with the most obvious and easy solutions.

On the other hand, it is very likely that you will do a better job than a
typical repair shop. You will probably have a better understanding of the
basic theory and will be able to spend much more time on the problem.
Hobbiest/handyman's time is cheap - as in free.

It is generally very easy to remove the top cover on most CD players. There
are usually some very obvious screws on the sides and possibly back as well.
These are nearly always Philips head type - use the proper screwdriver. Once
all the screws are out, the top cover will lift up or slide back and then
come off easily. If it still does not want to budge, recheck for screws you
may have missed.

Once the top cover is removed, the optical deck and electronics board will
usually be readily accessible.

With most designs, the entire optical deck can be lifted out after removing 3
or 4 screws. One screw may have a grounding contact under it. Replace this in
exactly the same position. There may be fragile flexible cables. Be careful
so as not to damage any. Usually, these cables plug in to connectors on the
electronics board and permit the entire optical deck to be easily replaced if
needed (not very common, however, despite what you may have heard).

In rare cases, removing the bottom cover will provide access to the solder
side of the electronics board. However, with most CD players, the bottom is
solid sheetmetal and the entire board would need to be unmounted.

For portables, the bottom plate usually comes off after removing several very
tiny screws - use the proper size Philips blade jeweler's screwdriver.

For CDROM drives, both top and bottom covers may be removable depending on
model.

Make notes of screw location and type and immediately store the screws away
in a pill bottle, film canester, or ice cube tray.

When reassembling the equipment make sure to route cables and other wiring
such that they will not get pinched or snagged and possibly broken, or have
their insulation nicked or pierced, and that they will not get caught in
moving parts. Replace any cable ties that were cut or removed during
disassembly and add additional ones of your own if needed. Some electrical
tape may sometimes come in handy to provide insulation insurance as well.
(This applies mostly to portables and CDROM drives - component CD players are
very wide open.

In component stereos units, there are normally linear supplies and thus very
reliable but easy to fix as well. In portables, they are likely to be

Usually, at least three voltages are needed: logic power (e.g. +5 Vcc) and a
pair of voltages for the analog circuitry (e.g., +/- 15V). However, some
designs use a variety of voltages for various portions of the analog (mainly)
circuitry.

@endnode
@node 6.4 "The optical deck"

This subsystem includes all of the components to load and spin the disc, the
optical pickup, and its positioning mechanism:

   o Loading drawer - Most portable and many lower cost CD players or CDROM
     drives lack this convenience. Most are motor driven. However, some must
     be pushed in or pulled out by hand.

     Common problems: loose or oily belt causing drawer to not open or close,
     or to not complete its close cycle. There can be mechanical damage such
     as worn/fractured gears or broken parts. The drawer switch may be dirty
     causing the drawer to decide on its own to close. The motor may be
     shorted, have shorted or open windings, or have a dry or worn bearing.

   o Spindle/spindle table - When the disc is loaded, it rests on this
     platform which is machined to automatically center it and minimize
     runout and wobble.

     Common Problems: Dirt on table surface, bent spindle, dry or worn
     bearings if spindle not part of motor but is belt driven, loose spindle.

   o Spindle motor - The motor that spins the disc. Most often the spindle
     platform is a press fit onto the spindle motor. Two types are common:
     The first is a miniature DC motor (using brushes) very similar to the
     common motors in toys and other battery operated devices. The second
     type is a brushless DC motor using Hall effect devices for commutation.
     In very rare cases, a belt is used to couple the motor to the spindle.

     Common problems: partially shorted motor, shorted or open winding,
     dry/worn bearings.

   o Clamper - Usually a magnet on the opposite side of the disc from the
     spindle motor which prevents slippage between the disc and the spindle
     platform. The clamper is lifted off of the disc when the lid or drawer
     is opened. Alternatively, the spindle may be lowered to free the disc.

     Common problems: doesn't engage fully permitting disc to slip on spindle
     due to mechanical problem in drawer closing mechanism.

   o Sled - The mechanism on which the optical pickup is mounted. The sled
     provide the means by which the optical pickup can be moved across the
     disc during normal play or to locate a specific track or piece of data.
     The sled is supported on guide rails and is moved by either a worm or
     ball gear, a rack and pinion gear, linear motor, or rotary positioner
     similar to what is in a modern hard disk drive - in increasing order of
     performance.

     Common problems: dirt, gummed up or lack of lubrication, damaged gears.

   o Pickup motor - The entire pickup moves on the sled during normal play or
     for rapid access to musical selections or CDROM data. The motor is
     either a conventional miniature permanent magnet DC motor with belt or
     gear with worm, ball, or rack and pinion mechanism, or a direct drive
     linear motor or rotary positioner with no gears or belts.

     Common problems: partially shorted motor, shorted or open winding, dry
     or worn bearings.

   o Optical pickup - This unit is the 'stylus' that reads the optical
     information encoded on the disc. It includes the laserdiode, associated
     optics, focus and tracking actuators, and photodiode array. The optical
     pickup is mounted on the sled and connects to the servo and readback
     electronics using flexible printed wiring cables.

     Common problems: hairline cracks in conductors of flexible cable causing
     intermittent behavior.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.5 "Components of the optical pickup"

All the parts described below are in the optical pickup. As noted, the
optical pickup is usually a self contained and replaceable subassembly.
Despite its being a precision optomechanical device, optical pickups are
remarkably robust in terms of susceptibility to mechanical damage.

   o Laserdiode - This is Infra Red (IR) emitting usually at 780 nm - near
     IR, just outside the visible range of 400-700 nm. The power output is no
     more than a few milliwatts though this gets reduced to .25-1.2 mW at the
     output of the objective lens. A photodiode inside the laserdiode case
     monitors optical power directly and is used in a feedback loop to
     maintain laser output at a constant and extremely stable value.

     Common problems: bad laserdiode or sensing photodiode resulting in
     reduction or loss of laser output.

   o Collimating lens - This converts the wedge shaped beam of the laserdiode
     into nearly parallel rays.

   o Diffraction grating - In a 'Three Beam Pickup', this generates two
     additional lower power (first order) beams, one on each side of the main
     beam which are used for tracking feedback. It is absent in a 'Single
     Beam Pickup'.

   o Cylindrical lens - In conjunction with the collimating lens, this
     provides the mechanism for accurate dynamic focusing by changing the
     shape of the return beam based on focal distance.

   o Beam splitter - Passes the laser output to the objective lens and disc
     and directs the return beam to the photodiode array.

   o Turning mirror - Redirects the optical beams from the horizontal of the
     optical system to vertical to strike the disc.

     Common problems: dirty mirror. Unfortunately, this may be difficult to
     access for cleaning.

The previous four items are the major components of the fixed optics. Outside
of damage caused by a serious fall, there is little to go bad. Better hope so
in any case - it is usually very difficult to access the fixed optics
components and there is no easy way to realign them anyhow. Fortunately,
except for the turning mirror, it is unlikely that they would ever need
cleaning. Usually, even the turning mirror is fairly well protected and
remains clean.

   o Objective lens - High quality focusing lens, very similar to a good
     microscope objective. N.A. of .45, focal length of 4 mm. Made of plastic
     with antireflection coating (the blue tinge in the center).

     Common problems: dirty lens, dirt in lens mechanism, damage from
     improper cleaning or excessive mechanical shock.

   o Photodiode array - This is the sensor which is used to read back data
     and control beams.

     Common problems: bad photodiode(s) resulting in improper or absence of
     focus and weak or missing RF signal.

   o Focus actuator - Since focus must be accurate to 1 micron - 1 um, a
     focus servo is used. The actuator is actually a coil of wire in a
     permanent magnetic field like the voice coil in a loudspeaker. The focus
     actuator can move the objective lens up and down - closer or farther
     from the disc based on focus information taken from the photodiode
     array.

     Common problems: broken coil, damaged suspension (caused by mechanical
     shock or improper cleaning techniques).

   o Tracking actuator - Like focus, tracking must be accurate to 1 um or
     better. A similar voice coil actuator moves the objective lens from side
     to side based on tracking feedback information taken from the photodiode
     array.

     NOTE: on pickups with rotary positioners, there may be no separate
     tracking coil as its function is subsumed by the positioner servo. The
     frequency response of the overall tracking servo system is high enough
     that the separate fine tracking actuator is not needed.

     Common problems: broken coil, damaged suspension (caused by mechanical
     shock or improper cleaning techniques).

@node 6.6 "Classification of CD player problems"

While there are a semi-infinite number of distinct things that can go wrong
with a CD player, any set of symptoms can be classified as a hard failure or
a soft failure:

  1. Hard failure - door opening/closing problems, disc is not recognized, no
     sound, unit totally dead.

  2. Soft failure - skips, continuous or repetitive audio noise, search or
     track seek problems, random behavior.

Both of these types of problems are common with CD players and CDROM drives.
The causes in both cases are often very simple, easy to locate, and quick and
inexpensive to repair.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.7 "Most common CD player problems"

The following two areas cover the most common types of problems you are
likely to encounter. For any situation where operation is intermittent or
audio output is noisy, skips, or gets stuck, or if some discs play and others
have noise or are not even recognized consistently, consider these FIRST:

   o Dirty lens - especially if your house is particularly dusty, the player
     is located in a greasy location like a kitchen, or there are heavy
     smokers around. Cleaning the lens is relatively easy and may have a
     dramatic effect on player performance.

   o Mechanical problems - dirt, dried up lubrication, damaged parts. These
     may cause erratic problems or total failure. The first part of a CD may
     play but then get stuck at about the time location.

     If your CD player has a 'transport lock' screw, check that it is in the
     'operate' position.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.8 "General inspection, cleaning, and lubrication"

The following should be performed as general preventive maintenance or when
any erratic behavior is detected. The lens, drawer mechanism, and sled drive
should be checked, and cleaned and/or lubricated if necessary.

You will have to get under the clamp to access the lens (drawer loading
models). Be gentle! NO lubrication is needed or should be used anywhere in
the lens assembly!

At the same time, you will have access to the spindle.

   o Objective lens - Carefully clean the lens assembly. Be careful! The lens
     is suspended by a voice coil actuated positioner which is relatively
     delicate. A CD lens cleaning disc is nearly worthless except for the
     most minor dust as it will not completely remove grease, grime, and
     condensed tobacco smoke products (yet another reason not to smoke!) and
     make matters worse by just moving the crud around.

     First, gently blow out any dust or dirt which may have collected inside
     the lens assembly. A photographic type of air bulb is fine but be
     extremely careful using any kind of compressed air source. Next, clean
     the lens itself. It is made of plastic, so don't use strong solvents.
     There are special cleaners, but alcohol (91% medicinal is ok, pure
     isopropyl is better. Avoid rubbing alcohol especially if it contains any
     additives) works ok for CD players and VCRs. There should be no problems
     as long as you dry everything off (gently!) reasonably quickly. DO NOT
     LUBRICATE! You wouldn't oil a loudspeaker, would you? When clean, the
     lens should be perfectly shiny with a blue tinge uniform over the
     central surface. If you can get to the turning mirror or prism under the
     lens without disturbing anything, clean that as well using the same
     procedure.

     Do NOT use strong solvents or anything with abrasives - you will destroy
     the lens surface most likely rendering the entire expensive pickup
     worthless.

   o Spindle bearing - Check the spindle bearing (this is primarily likely to
     cause problems with repetitive noise). There should be no detectable
     side to side play. I.e., you should not be able to jiggle the platform
     that the CD sits on. If you find that the bearings are worn, it is
     possible to replace the motor (about $10 from various mail order
     houses), though removing and replacing the disc platform may prove
     challenging as a result of the usual press fit mounting.

     The focus servo can compensate for a vertical movement of the disc
     surface of 1 mm or so. A small bearing side play can easily cause larger
     vertical errors - especially near the end (outer edge) of the disc. Even
     if you are not experiencing problems due to bearing wear, keep your
     findings in mind for the future.

     Sometimes there is a bearing runout adjustment screw on the bottom of
     the spindle if the spindle is not driven by a standard permanent magnet
     motor. I have seen this in a Sony Discman which had a custom motor
     assembly. A small tweak to this may fix a marginal spindle problem.

To access the drawer mechanism and sled drive in component units, you will
probably need to remove the optical deck from the chassis. It is usually
mounted by 3 long screws (one of which may have a grounding doodad - don't
lose it. In portables and CDROMs, the bottom panel of the unit will need to
be removed. Try not to let any of the microscrews escape! A good set of
jeweler's screwdrivers is a must for portables.

(From the Editor:

If you live in the USA, Sears has an excellent series of TINY screw-drivers
in the Craftsman series. A set of 12 (4 flat, 4 Phillips, and 4 Torx sizes 4,
5, 6, 8 !!!) costs about ~$20. They will replace whatever breaks - An
excellent deal! BTW, if the store doesn't carry it, they can probably order
them for you. You can also buy individual pieces.)

   o Drawer mechanism (if present) - Check for free movement. Test the belt
     for life - it should be firm, reasonably tight, and should return to its
     original length instantly if stretched by 25% or so. If the belt fails
     any of these criteria, it will need to be replaced eventually, though a
     thorough cleaning of the belt and pulleys with isopropyl alcohol (dry
     quickly to avoid damaging the rubber) or soap and water may give it a
     temporary reprieve.

     Also, check the gears and motor for lubrication and damage and correct
     as necessary. Clean and lubricate (if necessary) with high quality light
     grease suitable for electronic mechanisms such as MolyLube or Silicone
     grease. A drop of light oil (electric motor oil, sewing machine oil) in
     the motor bearings may cure a noisy or dry bearing.

   o Sled drive - check the components which move the pickup including
     (depending on what kind of sled drive your unit has) belt, worm gear,
     other gears, slide bearings. These should all move freely (exception: if
     there is a lock to prevent accidental damage while the unit is being
     transported the pickup may not move freely or very far). Inspect for
     damage to any of these components which might impede free movement.
     Repair or replace an appropriate. Clean and lubricate (if necessary)
     with just a dab of high quality light grease suitable for electronic
     mechanisms such as MolyLube or Silicone grease). A drop of light oil
     (electric motor oil, sewing machine oil) in the motor bearings may cure
     a noisy or dry bearing.
     Also see the section: @{"Testing the sled for mechanical problems" link "9.9"}

Try to play a disc again before proceeding further. I guess you have already
done this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.9 "Lubrication of CD players"

The short recommendation is: DO NOT add any oil or grease unless you are
positively sure it is needed. Most moving parts are lubricated at the factory
and do not need any further lubrication over their lifetime. Too much
lubrication is worse then too little. It is easy to add a drop of oil but
difficult and time consuming to restore an optical pickup that has taken a
bath.

NEVER, ever, use WD40! WD40 is not a good lubricant despite the claims on the
label. Legend has it that the WD stands for Water Displacer - which is one of
the functions of WD40 when used to coat tools for rust prevention. WD40 is
much too thin to do any good as a general lubricant and will quickly collect
dirt and dry up.

A light machine oil like electric motor or sewing machine oil should be used
for gear or wheel shafts. A plastic safe grease like silicone grease or
Molylube is suitable for gears, cams, or mechanical (piano key) type mode
selectors. Never use oil or grease on electrical contacts.

Unless the unit was not properly lubricated at the factory (which is quite
possible), don't add any unless your inspection reveals the specific need. In
a CD player or CDROM drive, there are a very limited number of failures
specifically due to lubrication.

Note that in most cases, oil is for plain bearings (not ball or roller) and
pivots while grease is used on sliding parts and gear teeth. If the old
lubricant is gummed up, remove it and clean the affected parts thoroughly
before adding new oil or grease.

In general, do not lubricate anything unless you know there is a need. Never
'shotgun' a problem by lubricating everything in sight! You might as well
literally use a shotgun on the equipment!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


@endnode
@node 7.1 "Unit is totally dead"

Check input power, power cord, fuse, power supply components. Locate the
outputs of the power transformer and trace them to the rectifiers and
associated filter capacitors and regulators. While the actual voltages will
probably not be marked, most of the power in a CD player will be typically
between +15 and -15 VDC. Sometimes, the voltage ratings of the filter
capacitors and/or regulators will provide clues as to correct power supply
outputs. Don't forget the obvious of the line cord, line fuse (if present),
and power switch - or outlet. Most component CD players use linear power
supplies so troubleshooting is straightforward. However, portables and CDROMs
use DC-DC inverters to generate the several voltages required and these are
more difficult to troubleshoot. If an incorrect power adapter was used, then
major damage can result despite the various types of protective measures
taken in the design.

I inherited a Sony Discman from a guy who thought he would save a few bucks
and make an adapter cord to use it in his car. Not only was the 12-15 volts
from the car battery too high but he got it backwards! Blew the DC-DC
converter transistor in two despite the built in reverse voltage protection
and fried the microcontroller. Needless to say, the player was a loss but the
cigarette lighter fuse was happy as a clam!

Moral: those voltage, current, and polarity ratings marked on portable
equipment are there for a reason. Voltage rating should not be exceeded,
though using a slightly lower voltage adapter will probably cause no harm
though performance may suffer. The current rating of the adapter should be at
least equal to the printed rating. The polarity, of course, must be correct.
If connected backwards with a current limited adapter, there may be no
immediate damage depending on the design of the protective circuits. But
don't take chances - double check that the polarities match - with a
voltmeter if necessary - before you plug it in! Note that even some
identically marked adapters put out widely different open circuit voltages.
If the unloaded voltage reading is more than 25-30% higher than the marked
value, I would be cautious about using the adapter without confirmation that
it is acceptable for your player. Needless to say, if the player behaves in
any strange or unexpected manner with a new adapter, if any part gets
unusually warm, or if there is any unusual odor, unplug it immediately and
attempt to identify the cause of the problem.

See the document: "Notes on the Repair of Audio equipment and other
Miscellaneous Stuff" for more info on troubleshooting of linear power
supplies. See the document "Notes on the Diagnose and Repair of small
SwitchMode Power Supplies (SMPS)" for more info on troubleshooting DC-DC
convertors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.2 "CD player is operational but there is no display"

Sometimes the display requires backlighting which uses miniature incandescent
lamps. These burn out. Usually, alternatives to the high priced exact
replacement bulbs can be located. Test the bulbs with an ohmmeter. Measure
the voltage across the light bulb connections and then replace the bulb with
one of about 25-50% higher voltage. These may not be quite as bright but
should last forever.

If the light bulbs are not at fault or there are no light bulbs, then check
for power to the display including bad connections or connectors that need to
be reseated. There could also be a power supply (e.g., missing voltage for a
vacuum fluorescent display) or driver problem.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.3 "CD player ignores you"

Symptoms are that the display comes up normal when power is turned on but all
(or certain) commands are ignored.

This could mean several things:

   o Front panel problem - one or more buttons are not responding. Reseat
     internal cables, clean or replace offending push button switches. If
     your CD player has a remote control, see if it operates correctly.

   o Reset failure - the player has failed to reset properly and is not ready
     for user input. Check power supply voltages, reseat internal connectors.

   o Controller and/or driver electronics for the affected functions are
     defective. Check power supply voltages, reseat internal connectors.

For all but the first one, a service manual will probably be needed to
precede further if the problem is not with a bad power supply or bad
connections.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.4 "Drawer does not open or close"

If the drawer doesn't open when the front panel button is pressed, listen for
motor attempting to open the drawer. If you hear it whirring but nothing
happens, check for an oily/loose belt or other mechanical fault. The belt may
be cleaned for temporary repair, replacement will be needed eventually. If
there is no attempt, motor, control chip, or front panel pushbutton (try with
the remote if you have one to eliminate this possibility) could be bad. Sony
players seem to have a built in timer that triggers the belt to go bad after
the warranty runs out. Also see the section on @{"Small Motors in CD Players" link "12.1"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.5 "Drawer operation is erratic"

You are about to remove your favorite CD but the player beats you to it,
closes the drawer, and starts playing it over again. Or, the drawer reverses
course halfway out. Or, the drawer motor continues to whir even after the
door is fully open or closed and the front panel is then unresponsive.

This is usually due to dirty contacts on the door position sense switches.
There are usually 3 sets of switch contacts associated with the drawer
mechanism. If any of these get dirty, worn, or bent out of place, erratic
operation can result:

   o Drawer closed sense switch - dirty contacts may result in the drawer
     motor continuing to whir after the door closes and the front panel may
     then be unresponsive. Eventually, the drawer may open on its own.

   o Drawer open sense switch - dirty contacts may result in the drawer motor
     continuing to whir after the door opens and the front panel may then be
     unresponsive. Eventually, the drawer may close on its own.

   o Drawer pushed sense switch - most CD players allow the user to start
     play by gently pushing on the drawer which depresses a set of switch
     contacts. If these are dirty, the result may be the drawer deciding to
     close on its own or reversing direction in the middle of opening or
     closing.

The solution to all these problems is usually to simply locate the offending
switches and clean their contacts. These switches contacts are usually not
protected from dust, dirt, and grime so that these types of problems are
quite common.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.6 "Drawer does not close completely"

This is a symptom that may not be obvious. The drawer may appear to close but
a loose or oily belt can prevent the mechanism from completing the close
cycle. This can result in erratic behavior since the disc clamping action is
often controlled by the movement - sometimes not recognizing disc, sometimes
just opening the drawer, or more subtle things like tracking problems, etc.
Clean the belt and see if there is any improvement. Belt replacement will be
necessary eventually. Check for gummed up lubrication as well.

If it goes through the motions of closing and then stops short without any
further sounds, a gear may have jumped a tooth or broken some. The result is
either that the mechanism is now incorrectly timed or not able to complete
the operation. Examine the mechanism closely for broken parts. Cycle it
manually by turning the appropriate motor pulley or gear to see if the drawer
gets hung up or is much more difficult to move at some point.

If it continues to make a whirring sound after the drawer stops, there might
be some other kind of mechanical damage resulting in an obstruction or really
gummed up lubrication not allowing the operation to complete.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.7 "Intermittent operation"

When a CD player appears to have a mood problem - playing fine sometimes or
for only part of a disc or aborting at random times, there can be several
possible causes including a dirty lens, dirty or worn interlock switch or bad
connections to interlock switch (mainly portables and boomboxes), flex cable
with hairline cracks in one or more conductors, other bad connections,
marginal power supply, defective disc.

   o Dirty, scratched, or defective CD - confirm that the CD is not the
     problem. Clean the disc and/or try another one.

   o Dirty lens - a player that accepts some discs and not others or accepts
     discs sporadically may simply need its eyeglasses cleaned.

   o Mechanical - oily, flabby belts preventing full drawer closing or gummed
     up lubrication on the sled (may fail depending on ambient temperature.
     For example, if the music gets stuck at about the same time on every
     disc, then there may be gunk on the end of the sled track preventing the
     sled from moving any further. This is especially likely if you just
     purchased a disc with an unusually long playing time - it has nothing to
     do with the musical tastes of the CD player! (There was this Chinese
     restaurant where the Chinese cooking grease apparently collected on the
     unused end portion of the sled track and when they tried to play an
     extra long CD.....)

     NOTE: some players will simply not play discs which exceed about 74
     minutes - the legal limit for CD playing time. Some discs may be as long
     as 78 minutes or more which means that some aspects of the CD
     specifications were compromised.

   o Bad connections - there are often many little connectors used to get
     signals and power between the optical deck and main circuit board. These
     are usually cheaply made and prone to failure. Wiggling and reseating
     these may cure these problems. There may even be bad solder connections
     on the pins of connectors or board mounted switches. Slight flexing or
     just expansion and contraction may result in intermittent shutdown or
     other problems. These problems are more likely with portables and
     boomboxes which may get abused.

   o Cracks in ribbon cable - The moving and fixed parts of the optical
     pickup are often joined with a printed flexible cable. Constant flexing
     may cause one or more of the copper traces to crack. This may show up as
     an inability to get past a certain point on every disc - the player may
     shut down or start skipping at around 23 minutes into every CD.

   o Dirty switches - oily film or oxidation may be preventing any of the
     limit or interlock switches from making reliable contact. If this is the
     case, the player may stop at random times, fail to accept a disc, close
     the drawer without your permission, etc. Use contact cleaner and typing
     paper to clean the contacts. Disassembly may be required for enclosed
     switches.

   o Power supply or logic problems are also possible but rare. However, if
     you have a scope, check the power supply outputs for ripple - a filter
     capacitor may have dried up and lost most of its capacitance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.8 "CD player or CDROM drive overheats"

A CD player which becomes noisy or a CDROM drive that fails to recognize
discs or reliably read data after a few minutes may have a component that is
heating up and changing value.

In general, there should not be much change in behavior from the instant
power is applied until the next millenniun. There is not much in a CD player
or CDROM which runs hot and might change characteristics. However, components
do sometimes fail in this manner. Problems of this type need to be diagnosed
in much the same way as one would find overheating components in a TV or
computer monitor.

You will need a can of cold spray ('circuit chiller') and an oscilloscope, if
available. Even a hair dryer on the no-heat setting will work in a pinch.

You are going to have to try cooling various components to try to determine
which one is bad. However, on a unit that dies completely and suddenly after
it warms this will not be much fun since you will not have ample opportunity
to detect changes in behavior. On a CD player that will play but with
tracking problems and/or audio noise, you should be able to monitor the
playback quality by simply listening for improvement when you have cooled the
flakey part. For a CDROM drive, play an audio disc if possible since this
will provide the feedback you need to locate the bad part without (hopefully)
it constantly shutting down due to data errors or inability to reliably
access the file system.

First, I would recommend running with the covers removed and see if that has
an effect confirming a thermal problem. Next, use the cold spray on
individual components like the LSI chips - quick burst, wait a few seconds
for something to change. If you are using the hairdryer, make a funnel out of
paper to direct the air flow. You will need to be more patient with this
approach.

If you have a scope, it would be nice to look at the RF 'eye' pattern during
this time and see if it decreases in amplitude and/or quality over the course
of an hour. If it does, you may have an overheating problem in the laserdiode
or its power supply.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


@endnode
@node 8.1 "What is a startup problem?"

Startup problems cover all situations where the player does not successfully
read the disc directory. Nearly everything in the optical deck and much of
the mainboard electronics needs to be functional to read the directory.
Therefore, a single failure in any of a large number of places can prevent
successful startup (and subsequent play).

   o On a single play unit, failure of the startup sequence may result in a
     display of no disc, disc, error; a full calander but no disc info; or it
     may just open the door and challenge you to provide it with a proper
     meal.

   o On a changer, failure of the startup sequence will likely result in a
     similar display but then the unit will move on to the next position in
     the carousel or cartridge. It will likely remember that it was
     unsuccessful at loading a disc for each position and eventually give up
     once all possible discs have been tried.

Possible causes for startup failure include: defective disc, dirty lens,
defective laser or photodiode array, bad focus or tracking actuator or
driver, dirty track, lack of or dried up lubrication, dirty or bad limit
switches or sensors, defective spindle motor, faulty electronics or control
logic, damaged parts, or faulty optical alignment or need for servo
adjustments. On the one hand this is a large number of possibilities. The
good news is that with such a large number of possibilities, there is a good
chance the problem will be minor and inexpensive to fix.

Don't overlook the trivial: are you loading the disc correctly? Most CD
players want the disc label-side up. However, some, like Pioneer magazine
type changers want the label-side down. If you have just acquired the CD
player, don't overlook this possibility.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.2 "Startup sequence"

There will be variations on the exact startup sequence of events depending on
the type of player and its design. The result may be a blank display, display
of the word 'disc' or 'error', flashing display, etc. In any case, you don't
get your music. By understanding the following summary as it applies to your
player, you should be able to determine what is going wrong.

What the CD player should do when a disc is inserted:

  1. Drawer closes (or with portables, lid is closed manually) and CD is
     clamped to spindle.

  2. Interlock (if present, always in portables) engages. In others, there
     may be an optical sensor or the optical pickup may act as its own disc
     sensor.

  3. Pickup resets to starting (index) location toward center of disc usually
     found with limit switch or optical sensor.

  4. For the following, refer to the diagram below of the photodetector
     organization typical in units with a 'three beam pickup'. E and F will
     be absent in units with a 'single beam pickup', though there may be
     other segments. The four quadrant photodetector is present in all
     systems.


                            +---+---+
 ---------_________ +---+   | A | B |   +---+
 Track--->          | E |   +---+---+   | F | ________
                    +---+   | C | D |   +---+         ---------
                            +---+---+                 Track--->

     The main return beam is detected by the array, ABCD. The tracking beams
     return to E and F. E is offset slightly off track on one side and F on
     the other. Average signals from E and F will be equal when centered on
     track.

     1. Laser is turned on and focus search routine is started to position
        lens at correct vertical position. Once correct focus is achieved,
        focus servo is activated to maintain it. Focus, which must be
        accurate to 1 um, operates as follows: The optical path in the pickup
        includes a cylindrical lens which causes the laser beam spot to be
        circular when correctly focussed but elliptical otherwise with the
        major axis of the ellipse being offset 90 degrees depending on
        whether the lens is to close or too far (e.g., major axis of +45
        degrees for too close and -45 degrees for too far). Focus Error =
        (A+D)-(B+C) = 0 for correct focus since with the circular spot, the
        outputs of all four quadrants will be equal.

     2. Disc starts spinning up to 500 rpm and Constant Linear Velocity (CLV)
        servo is activated to maintain correct speed. CLV servo uses a PLL to
        lock to clock transitions derived from data read off of disc. Data is
        derived from A+B+C+D.

     3. Tracking servo is activated to maintain laser beam centered on track.
        With 'three beam pickup', 2 additional laser spots are projected onto
        the disc in front of and behind main beam. These are offset on each
        side of the track just enough so that Tracking Error = E-F = 0 when
        centered. With a 'single beam pickup', similar information is derived
        using only the main beam since Tracking Error = (A+B)-(C+D) = 0 for
        correct tracking.
  5. Disc directory is read and displayed.

  6. Unit shuts down awaiting command or goes into play mode depending on how
     it was activated.

The steps listed as (4a,b,c) may or may not be performed concurrently. If any
of 1-5 fail, then the laser is turned off and the machine will display some
kind of error no disc message (typically, it may display Error, Disc, or go
blank) and return to idle mode, or in the case of a changer, load the next
disc and try again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.3 "Procedure for validating the startup sequence"

The following procedure is used when the disc is not recognized but the
drawer closes completely.

First, double check the drawer closing/opening mechanism. Without exception,
Sony CD players which have belts need them cleaned and eventually replaced.
If the drawer does not close completely, then the disc may not be clamped
properly or other erratic problems may occur.

Once you have verified that this is ok, you need to determine that the lens
is clean. In general, the lens should look shiny with a blue tinge. Any scum
or crud can degrade performance. You may have to remove part of the clamping
mechanism to be able to see the lens. If it is not perfectly shiny, clean it
using the procedures in the section: @{"General inspection, cleaning, and lubrication" link "6.8"}

Assuming that this does not improve the situation, the next step is to verify
that the pickup has reset itself to the inner (center) track of the disc. If
necessary manually move the pickup away from the center by turning the
appropriate pulley or gear, or in the case of a linear actuator or rotary
positioner (no gears or belts), just push the pickup gently and observe the
behavior when a disc is loaded. The pickup should move smoothly toward the
center, usually tripping a limit switch and stopping. If there is no movement
or movement is jerky or the pickup gets stuck at some point, then lubrication
may be needed or the motor or drive circuitry may be faulty. Also, check for
broken or damaged gear teeth, a slipping belt, and misaligned or damaged
tracks. Measure the voltage on the motor that moves the pickup. If there is
none or it is very low (under a volt or so), then there is a problem with the
motor, its driver, or the system controller.

Determine if the machine attempts to focus. On portables, it is sufficient to
defeat the door interlock to get the operations associated with reading of
the disc directory to begin (you may need to press play - this is model
dependent). In some component CD players, a disc actually has to be present
to block an optical sensor. You should see the lens moving up and down (at
least one of these directions will have smooth movement) once or twice about
2 mm. If a disc is in place, then the lens should quickly stop at the
appropriate focus position. Admittedly, observing the lens may be difficult
or impossible with the disc in place. Dentists are probably good at this!

If the focus action is identical whether a disc is in place or not - i.e., it
keeps up the search pattern and then gives up - verify that the laser is
being powered. In most cases, you should be able to see a tiny spot of red
appearing light when the lens is viewed from an oblique angle during the
focus search. From a safe distance of at least six inches and 45 degrees or
more off to one side, you should be able to see this dim red light in a
darkened room while the unit is attempting to focus. If you see this, you can
assume that the laser is being powered though it is not a sure test for an
actual IR laser beam or proper optical power output. In most cases, however,
the red light indicates that the laser is working. An IR detector would
confirm at least that there is an IR emission. If there is no dot of red
light, then either the laserdiode is bad, it is not being powered, or you are
not looking from the correct angle. You can purchase an inexpensive IR
detector card from an electronics distributor or build one using a
photodiode, a few resistors, a general purpose small signal transistor, and
an LED running off a 9 V battery. See the schematic at the end of this
document. This will also be useful for testing remote controls. If you have a
modern camcorder (one with a CCD pickup, not a tube), it may be sensitive to
IR as well but using one to test a CD laser would be pretty clunky to say the
least (you would probably need to grow an extra arm or two).

Once focus is established (and sometimes concurrent with this operation), the
spindle should begin to turn and quickly reach 500 rpm. The speed may be
ramped up or controlled in some other search pattern since there is no speed
feedback until the data coming off of the disc is available. A partially
shorted motor will prevent the spindle from reaching 500 rpm even though the
disc will spin. Check the voltage on the spindle motor when it starts the
disc spinning. It should reach 2 volts or more. If less than this but not
zero, a partially shorted motor or weak driver is likely. If zero at all
times then there may be a bad driver or the machine may not realize that
focus was established and is not issuing the spindle motor start command. The
required speed of 500 rpm - just over 8 revolutions per second - can be
estimated by using a disc with a dramatic label or putting a piece of tape on
the side of the disc that is visible and watching it spin.

Note that a dirty lens can sometimes result in symptoms similar to a bad
spindle motor so cleaning the lens should always be the first step when
servicing a CD player. I almost learned this the hard way.

Once the disc reaches the correct speed, the speed control (Constant Linear
Velocity, CLV) and tracking servos will be activated (or the tracking servo
may actually have been active all along) and directory data will be read off
of the disc. Either of these could be faulty and/or misadjusted making it
impossible to access the disc directory.

During the time that the disc is spinning and the player is attempting to
read the disc directory, listen for that 'gritty' sound that CD players make
during normal operation. It is a byproduct of the focus and tracking servos
constantly adjusting lens position - the rapid movements of the lens produce
audible sound like a loudspeaker - and its presence is a good indication that
(1) the laser is working and (2) focus is being maintained.

On certain CD players, for example many Pioneer models, there is a TEST mode
which enables many of the individual functions such as focus and tracking
that are normally automatic to be manually enabled. This is a very useful aid
is diagnosis and in adjusting a machine from an unknown state as would be the
case if someone else twiddled every internal adjustment they could find! See
the section: @{"Pioneer PDM series test mode" link "13.1"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.4 "Disc spins in wrong direction or overspeeds and is never recognized"

The CD should always spin clockwise as viewed from the label side of the CD.
This is usually the top but for some players you load the CD upside-down
(e.g. Pioneer magazine type changers). If the CD should consistently start
spinning counterclockwise and continue for more than a fraction of a
revolution, or should the CD ever spin at a much faster rate than normal - as
though it is about to take off, there may be a serious problem with the
optical pickup, spindle servo, or control logic. However, behavior of this
type could simply be the result of any of a number of minor faults which you
can diagnose and repair including a dirty lens, the disc being loaded
upside-down, or the internal adjustments being messed up due to someone
violating rule #1 - never wildly tweak any internal adjustments!

First confirm that the disc is loaded correctly and that the lens is clean.

If this does not help, attempt to perform a servo system adjustment. If you
have a service manual, by all means follow it! If not, see the section:
@{"General servo adjustment procedure" link "11.6"}  If it is a Pioneer CD player or
changer, see the section: @{"Pioneer PD-M400/500/600 etc. servo adjustment procedure" link "13.4"}
(this may also apply to other models with only minor changes).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


@endnode
@node 9.1 "Description of these types of failures"

Proper readout of the digital audio or data on a CD depends on the proper
functioning of the focus, and tracking servos and the system controller.

While playing, searching, or seeking, focus must be maintained continuously
despite spindle runout, a moderately warped disc, and minor bumps or
vibration.

When playing at normal speed (e.g., 1X for music), the fine tracking servo
maintains the laser beam centered on the track (pits of the information
layer) of the CD while the coarse tracking servo moves the entire optical
pickup as needed to keep the tracking error within well defined limits. See
the section: @{"Servo systems" link "11.1"} Failures or marginal performance of any of
these systems can result in audio noise, skipping, sticking, or failure of
seek and search operations.

A dirty or badly scratched or warped disc, a dirty lens, as well as other
electronic or mechanical problems can result in similar symptoms as well.

Thus, if you experience any of the problems discussed in the next few
sections, first confirm that the disc is not dirty, scratched, smudged,
warped, or otherwise defective - inspect and clean it if necessary and/or try
a different one. If this does not help, then manually clean the lens.

The importance of doing these simple things first cannot be overemphasized as
many apparently unrelated problems can be caused by a bad disc or dirty lens.

Then, check for obvious mechanical faults like gummed up lubrication or a
worn spindle bearing. Only after these efforts do not solve your problem or
at least identify the cause, should you consider adjusting any of the servo
systems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.2 "Short distance skipping"

This means jumping forward or backward by a fraction of a second. It may
occur occasionally or may appear as though the pickup is bouncing across the
disc.

Common causes include dirty lens, dirty or damaged disc, need to adjust fine
tracking offset/gain or tracking balance, weak laser.

First, inspect the disc for badly scratched or smudged areas and other
defects or try another one. Clean the lens.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.3 "Playback gets stuck (rapid repeat)"

This means repeating the same track or a small number of tracks (meaning disc
rotations, in this case). The effect is somewhat like a 'broken record' with
an LP but at a much faster rate - 3 to 8 repeats per second when repeating
only a single track.

The most common underlying cause is a damaged or dirty disc. However, if the
tracking (and sometimes focus as well) servos are not properly adjusted, the
CD player may exhibit excessive sensitivity to disc problems.

If the focus or tracking gais is set too high or the offsets/balance are not
centered, slight disc imperfections, scratches, or dirt may result in this
set of symptoms.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.4 "Occasional long distance skipping or repeating"

Usually, several seconds of music will play without any trouble and then
there will be a skip forward or backwards by a few seconds or longer. In the
latter case, the net effect may be to constantly repeat a section of the CD.
Make sure you do not have any repeat modes enabled!

Common causes include a dirty lens; dirt, foreign materials, or lack of
lubrication in pickup drive; defective disc (surface defects, dirt, or
fingerprints); mechanical damage causing mechanism to bind.

First, inspect the disc for badly scratched or smudged areas and other
defects or try another one. Clean the lens.

A mechanical fault is quite likely. These symptoms generally indicate that
the coarse tracking servo is unable to properly move the pickup easily as it
should - it is getting stuck and then either jumping back once the error is
too great or breaking free and moving forward in spurts.

Eliminate the possibility of mechanical problems - see the section:
@{"Testing the sled for mechanical problems" link "9.9"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.5 "Player gets stuck at approximately same time on multiple discs"

Common causes: gummed up lubrication on pickup tracks or worm gear, other
mechanical problems like an obstruction or errant wire getting in the way. A
flex cable with a hairline crack in one or more conductors might also cause
this symptom.

Carefully inspect the tracks for dirt and gummed up lubrication. If the
player has been in commercial service always playing the same CD or set of
CDs and now you are attempting to one that is someone longer, this may
happen.

Also, if you are attempting to play a CD which is longer than 74 minutes, the
player may not be capable of accessing the last part of the CD. It might
either abort or get stuck and keep repeating a fraction of a second or
several seconds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.6 "Search or seek operations take too long or fail to complete"

This means that attempting to seek to a particular music track results in
this never completing or going to the wrong place. Alternatively, even
pressing the search forward or backward buttons may result in the failure to
go where directed. The player may abort the disc and stop or (in the case of
a changer) go on to the next one.

Common causes: dirty lens, bad disc, tracking or CLV PLL adjustments needed,
mechanical problems with pickup movement, faulty sled motor drive IC, faulty
control logic, bad flex cable.

If your CD player has a 'transport lock' screw, check that it is in the
'operate' position.

Inspect the disc for badly scratched or smudged areas and other defects or
try another one. Clean the lens.

Eliminate the possibility of mechanical problems - see the section:
@{"Testing the sled for mechanical problems" link "9.9"}

Check for a printed flex cable that has hairline cracks in one or more
traces.  As the pickup moves past a certain location, a critical connection
may open up resulting in this behavior. Such a cause is more likely if the
player aborts without warning during a seek or search.

If none of this uncovers the problem, there may be sled motor driver, logic,
controller, or other electronic problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.7 "Search, seek, or play starts at proper place but then loses time or position"

You may select music track 5, the player goes there quickly, starts to play
but immediately jumps to another location forward or backwards or resets to
the start of the disc. Or, if play is started at any location, instead of
playing forward as would be expected, the numbers in the display count down.

Common causes include a stuck button, need to adjust coarse tracking offset
or tracking balance, bad sled motor drive IC, faulty control logic, defective
disc.

First, try a different CD to make sure it is not defective. Or, try different
locations on the same CD as the CD would likely not be defective over its
entire surface.

While a dirty lens is possible, it is not as likely as for many other
tracking problems.

This may be a problem with coarse tracking offset or tracking balance. See
the section: @{"Adjustment procedure for noise or skipping" link "11.3"}

To eliminate the possibility of a stuck button, it may be possible to operate
the player with the relevant part of the front panel control unplugged using
the remote control (if it has one) or the 'press the drawer' method of
starting play. If either of these results in the disc playing normally, then
a stuck or dirty button is likely. This will most likely require the
disassembly and cleaning or replacement of the affected push button switch.

It is possible that the sled motor driver IC or its logic is bad: when the
tracking servo is closed, its output is highly unbalanced due to an internal
failure. Unless you want to take a shot in the dark and replace the chip,
further troubleshooting of this problem will likely require a service manual.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.8 "Repetitive noise at disc rotation rate (500-200 rpm depending on track)"

Common causes: dirty lens, bent spindle, excessive runout (wear) of spindle
bearing, loose spindle, foreign material on disc table, warped disc, need to
adjust focus or fine tracking offset/gain, weak laser.

First, inspect the disc for badly scratched or smudged areas and other
defects or try another one. Clean the lens.

Check for a loose spindle (sometimes there is a set screw that needs to be
tightened or some adhesive may have broken free. Make sure there is no dirty
or other foreign matter on the spindle table that could cause the disc to
seat improperly.

Observe the disc as it spins. Is the edge moving up and down by more than a
total of about 1 mm? If so, the disc may be excessively warped, or possibly
the spindle bearing is worn resulting is unacceptable runout, or (unlikely
unless the player was thrown off a cliff) the spindle is bent. The focus and
fine tracking servos may be incapable of correcting such a large wobble.

If the problem developed gradually and has been getting worse, than a worn
spindle bearing is a distinct possibility. Adjustment of focus and fine
tracking offset (or possibly gain but usually less critical) may help.

Alternatively, focus or fine tracking offset (or possibly gain but usually
less critical) may simply have drifted a bit and adjustment is all that is
needed.

A weak laser may also result in these symptoms but do not attempt to adjust
laser power until other possibilities have been investigated fully.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.9 "Testing the sled for mechanical problems"

Binding or obstructions would be indicated by any long distance skipping,
jumping, repeating, or failure to seek or search past some location (time) on
multiple discs. Defective or erratic limit switches may result in jamming or
overrun at start or end of disc or unreliable reset during startup.

Check for free movement of the optical pickup sled on its tracks or bearings.
Manually rotate the appropriate motor or gear or in the case of a voice coil
(linear or rotary) positioner, gently move the pickup back and forth
throughout its range. There should be no sticky positions or places where
movement is noticeably more difficult. If there are, inspect for mechanical
problems like broken or damaged gear teeth, dirt or other material that
should not be there, and gummed up lubrication. Damaged parts will need to be
replaced (or repaired - sometimes a fine file, Xacto knife, or dental pick
will work wonders but don't count on it). Otherwise, cleaning and lubrication
may be all that is needed. Remove the dirt and the old gummed up lubricants
and lubricate the tracks and/or gears using the proper oil or grease. (See
the sections: "Lubrication of CD players"

If these tests come up negative, check out the pickup motor for defects such
as a shorted or open winding, partially shorted commutator, or dry or worn
bearings. See the section: @{"Testing of motors" link "12.3"}

As a double check, disconnect the pickup motor from its driving circuit
(extremely important!) and run it in both directions with a 3 V (2 AA)
battery to confirm electrical and mechanical operation.

In addition, check the proper functioning of any limit switches that are
present on the optical deck. There will almost always be one for the inner
(reset - startup) track and there may be one for the outer track
(end-of-disk) as well. Run the pickup manually or using the battery (see
above) to both ends without forcing and check for reliable operation of the
switch contacts.

@endnode
@node 10.1 "Audio problems"

Silly me, what other kinds of problems are we talking about. OK, I should
have said audio signal chain problems.

There is a distinct boundary between the digital section where audio
information is encoded digitally and the analog domain where it is an
electrical waveform.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.2 "Problems with the digital circuitry"

Problems in the digital domain will usually be gross - extreme noise, noise
correlated with the signal level, extreme distortion, tones or frequencies
that with no stretch of the imagination were present in the original music,
etc.

Characteristics will be distinctly different than the kind of noise or
distortion we are accustomed to in stereo equipment. Small errors in the
digital reconstruction can result in totally gross changes in the audio
output. For example, a single bit error if in the MSB can totally corrupt the
resulting waveform. Simple errors can result in sound frequencies not present
in the original. Fortunately, these sorts of errors are relatively rare as
most of the circuitry is inside of very reliable LSI chipsets.

However, if the CD is recognized and appears to behave normally except that
there is absolutely no audio output, there can be problems in the audio
decoding LSI chips. Other than hoping for an obvious bad connection, this is
way beyond the scope of anything you can hope to repair without the service
manual, test equipment, and a miracle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.3 "Problems with the analog circuitry"

Problems in the analog sections - D/A, sample-and-hold, post analog filter -
produce effects that are more familiar: noise, decrease in signal strength,
and distortion. Except for parts of the D/A which may be shared, there will
be identical left and right channels to compare if an audio problem develops.

If only one channel is affected, then the problem most likely has nothing to
do with tracking, the laser, or the mechanism. Coming off of the disc, the L
and R channels are interleaved on a sample (16 bit word) basis so any disc or
pickup problem would equally impact both L and R.

You are left with the D/A and sample-and-hold or D/As or the final analog
filter. Many CD players multiplex the D/A between L and R, so in these, even
the D/A is ruled out since most of its circuitry is common.

With a single D/A, there will be sample-and-hold circuits for each channel as
well.

Players without digital filters (or oversampling) have fairly complex analog
filters after the D/A. A bad or noisy component could conceivably be your
problem. Even players with fancy oversampling have some kind of a final
analog filter.

On an older player, there is probably a lot of discrete circuitry in the
audio section.

If you can get to the components in the analog filter (some are potted), then
with a test CD which has a 'silence track' and a scope or signal tracer, you
should be able to find out where the noise is being introduced. If it has
separate D/As, then one of these would also be suspect.

Swapping components one at a time between the identical left and right
channels is also a valid diagnostic technique.

Don't overlook the simple problems of dirty contacts on the RCA jacks or bad
connections where they are soldered to the main circuit board.

@endnode
@node 10.4 "Boomboxes and compact stereo systems"

These combine a stereo receiver and a single or dual cassette deck, and/or a
CD player or changer, and a pair of detachable speakers, into a single unit.
Most are fairly portable but larger boomboxes and compact stereos may require
a forklift to move any great distance.

While the individual subsystems - CD player for example - are usually
relatively self contained electrically except for a common power supply,
mechanically, everything tends to be jumbled together - even on units that
have an outward appearance of separate components. Both cassette transports
are usually driven from a single motor. Getting at the CD player may require
removal of both cassette decks, audio amplifier, and power supply. Working on
these is not fun. As usual, take careful notes as you disassemble the unit
and expect it to require some time just to get to what you are after. Be
especially careful when removing and replacing the individual modules if
printed flex cables are used for interconnections.

Refer to the relevant sections on cassette transports, loudspeakers, and
power supplies for problems with these units.

Since these do get abused - bumped, dropped, dunked, etc., bad connections,
and other damage is very common.

@node 10.5 "CD player was dropped or got wet"

I have never heard of a component CD player being dropped or rained on.
However, this does happen to portables. While a service shop may not even
want to tackle such a unit, it is quite possible that damage is minimal -
even for a CD player.

With a CD player that has been dropped, unplug it from the AC line or remove
the batteries immediately. This will prevent further damage should anything
be shorting internally.

For one that has gotten wet, dry it immediately (you knew that!).

@endnode
@node 10.6 "Repairing flexible printed cables"

It seems that more and more consumer devices from pocket cameras to laptop
computers are being built with miniature multiconductor flexible printed
cables. Very often one or more traces to develop hairline cracks due to
repeated flexing. In addition, damage from moving circuit boards and modules
during servicing is all to common.

Needless to say, repairing any kind of flex cable is a real pain. I have
succeeded by carefully scraping the plastic off with an Xacto knife and then
soldering fine wire (#30 gauge wire wrap for example) to the traces. This
presumes that the conductors on your cable will even take solder. I then
cover up the joints with a flexible sealer for electrical and mechanical
protection.

However, you need to make sure that the wire you use can be flexed or that
the joint is set up in such a way that the wire does not flex much - else you
will just end up with broken wires pretty quickly.

Soldering from end point to end point if possible may be preferable. Even
going to only one endpoint would reduce the risk of immediate damage and
reliability problems in the future.

With multiple traces broken or damaged, you are probably better off replacing
the cable entirely.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


@endnode
@node 11.1 "Servo systems"

There are several servo systems in a CD player:

  1. Focus - maintains a constant distance to within 1 um (1/25,000th of an
     inch!) or so between the objective lens and the disc. This must be
     maintained even with a slightly warped or uneven disc and in a portable
     player, with a certain amount of movement as well. Focus is accomplished
     with a voice coil type of positioner (similar to operation of a
     loudspeaker) using optical feedback from the disc surface. See the
     section of @{"Startup Problems" link "8"} for a description of how this and fine
     tracking (below) operate.

  2. Fine tracking - centers the laser beam on the disc track (to within a
     fraction of a um) and compensates for side-to-side runout of the disc
     and player movement. This also uses a voice coil positioner and optical
     feedback from the disc surface. (NOTE: on rotary type pickups, there may
     be no separate tracking coil as its function is combined with the rotary
     positioner.)

  3. Coarse tracking - moves the entire pickup assembly as a function of fine
     tracking error exceeding a threshold or based on user or microcontroller
     requests (like search or skip). Coarse tracking uses several types of
     positioners depending on performance requirements. It may either be a
     worm drive, a gear drive, a linear motor, or rotary positioner - in
     order of increasing access speed.

     The linear motor and rotary positioner have no gears and simply use a
     coil and permanent magnet to move the entire pickup very quickly -
     similar to a voice coil but on a larger scale. CDROMs, especially the
     high performance models, usually use this type of actuator to achieve
     their relatively fast access. These may have some type of lock to
     prevent the pickup from banging around when the unit is moved with power
     off. NOTE: for a CDROM drive that uses a caddy - always remove the caddy
     before transporting the drive or the equipment that it is in. The
     loading of the caddy often unlocks the pickup permitting it to flop
     around during movement and possibly being damaged.

     A linear motor or rotary positioner driven pickup should move very
     smoothly and easily by hand when unpowered and unlocked.

     Note that the use of a rotary positioner is no guarantee of fast
     response. One of the earliest CD players - a Magnavox unit apparently
     manufactured by Philips - has about the slowest track seek time I have
     ever seen and uses a rotary positioner. Watching it go from one track to
     another is like watching an inch worm crawl along - ssst, ssst, ssst
     (the sound made as the focus actuator vibrates while crossing tracks),
     ssst, ssst.

  4. Spindle speed - maintains constant linear velocity (CLV) of disc
     rotation based on a PLL locking to the clock signal recovered from the
     disc. Spindle drive is most often done with a permanent magnet DC motor
     connected to the disc platform. It may be similar to the other motors in
     CD players and VCRs, (as well as toys for that matter), or a higher
     quality brushless DC motor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.2 "Play adjustments"

You will see a circuit board, hopefully in your unit it is readily accessible
with component markings. For each servo, there will be 1 or 2 pots to adjust.
Unfortunately for our purposes, some CD players have no adjustments! In this
case about all you can do is confirm that the lens is clean and clean and
lubricate the mechanism.

The adjustments will be labeled something like:

  1. Focus - F.G. (focus gain), F.O. (focus offset)
  2. Tracking - T.G. (tracking gain)
  3. T.O. (tracking offset), maybe others
  4. Spindle PLL, PLL adj., Speed, or something like that.

DO NOT TOUCH THE LASER POWER ADJUSTMENT - you can possibly ruin the laser if
you turn it up too high. Sometimes, just turning it with power applied can
destroy the laserdiode due to a noisy potentiometer. This adjustment can only
be made properly with the service manual. It may require an optical power
meter to set laser output. Very often the adjustment is on the optical pickup
itself so it should be easy to avoid. Sometimes it is on the main PCB. The
laser optical power output is feedback controlled and unlikely to change
unless the laser is defective - in which case adjustments will have little
effect anyway. If you run out of options, see the section on 
@{"Laser Power Adjustment" link "14.8"} - last.

DO NOT JUST GO AND TWEAK WILDLY. You will never be able to get back to a
point where the disc will even be recognized (without test equipment and
probably a service manual).

First, somehow mark the EXACT positions of each control. Some of these may
require quite precise setting - a 1/16 of a turn could be critical,
especially for the offset adjustments.

Sometimes, there will be marked test points, but even then the exact
procedure is probably model dependent.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.3 "Adjustment procedure for noise or skipping"

The assumption here is that you can get the disc to play but there is audio
noise skipping, or other similar problem.

Play a disc at the track that sounds the worst - put it into repeat mode so
it will continue for awhile. Get it to play by whatever means works.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.4 "Repetitive noise at disc rotation frequency"

Try to locate the adjustments for focus. Try the focus offset first, just a
hair in each direction. If you go too far, you will loose focus lock totally,
the servo will go into focus search mode and/or the unit will shut down.
Return the control to the exact original position if there is no improvement.
You can also try gain, but in my experience, the gain controls are not
critical to normal play but determine how the unit will handle dirty and/or
defective discs. However, if they are way off, there could be general
problems. Too low a gain setting (this applies to focus as well as tracking)
will make the unit very prone to skipping as a result of minor bumps. Too
high a setting will make the unit skip as a result of minor disc defects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.5 "Short distance skipping or sticking"

Try to locate the adjustments for tracking. Try the fine tracking offset
first, just a hair in each direction. If you go too far, you will loose servo
lock totally, the pickup will slew to one end of the disc, and/or the unit
will shut down. Return the control to the exact original position if there is
no improvement. Then try the other tracking offset if there is one and also
the gain (though this is probably not the problem).

Always return each control to its original position after the test so you
don't confuse things more.

If you have a service manual for your player, by all means follow its
recommendations or at least read through its adjustment procedures before
attempting the one given below.

If your CD player has a TEST MODE, see the section:
@{"Pioneer PD-M400/500/600 etc. servo adjustment procedure" link "13.4"} and modify it accordingly.
The following procedure is for a typical unit without such a test feature.
It assumes that the unit is functional but internal controls are not in their
correct position. This might be the case if you violated rule #1 - never wildly
tweak any internal adjustments! Or, if a major subassembly like the optical
pickup or mainboard has been replaced.

If you have not touched the internal controls and no major parts have been
replaced, there is no need to perform this procedure. Use techniques and
observations discussed elsewhere in this document.

The following are assumed:

   o Controls on the main board are in an unknown state but not any laser
     power adjustments (hopefully, these were on the optical pickup itself or
     its flex cable and were not touched.

   o The player is otherwise functional - there is no physical damage.

You may need to modify this procedure based on your particular model. Some of
the adjustments may go by different names or be non-existent. Use your
judgement. Except for the laser power adjustment, which should be avoided, it
is unlikely that any settings of these controls will result in permanent
damage.

Some of these adjustment will need to be performed while the unit is in the
startup sequence attempting to read the disc directory. Until focus and
possibly tracking and CLV lock are established, it may give up fairly
quickly.  You will just need to keep cycling power or opening and closing the
drawer to get it to repeat the attempt. Once some subset of the servo
adjustments are set within reasonable limits, the player may continue to spin
the disc ad-infinitum.

  1. Precisely mark the current positions of all internal adjustments - just
     in case they were already set correctly!

  2. Set all main board controls to their midpoint.

  3. Adjust TR BAL (Tracking Balance) to the center of the range over which
     the sled remains stationary. Outside this range, the pickup will slew to
     one end or the other. Not all CD players have this control. A CD may
     need to be in place for this adjustment to have any effect. If you are
     unable to get the pickup to remain stationary, try fine tracking offset
     (TR.OFF) as well.

     The following two items should be done with no disc in place. If your
     player does not have suitable test points or if these controls have no
     effect without a disc in place, skip them.

  4. While monitoring the testpoint for focus error (e.g., TP.FE), adjust
     focus offset (FO.OFF) for 0 volts (+/- 10 mV or so). This may not be the
     optimal setting but will get you in the ballpark.

  5. While monitoring the testpoint for tracking error (e.g., TP.TE), adjust
     fine tracking offset (TR.OFF) for 0 volts (+/- 10 mV or so). This may
     not be the optimal setting but will get you in the ballpark.

  6. If you have a DMM, VOM, or scope, put it on the Focus OK testpoint if
     there is one.
  7. Load a disc and press PLAY if necessary to initiate the startup
     sequence.

  8. Confirm that focus is established. There is an adjustment range for
     Focus Offset over which focus will be reliably achieved. Outside this
     range:

      o The lens will hunt up and down - possibly with clicking sounds as it
        bumps into the end stops.

      o The Focus OK testpoint will not be asserted or will be jumping around
        as well.

      o The disc may never start spinning or spin erratically (model
        dependent).

      o Single play units will give up and enter stop more with display of
        'disc', 'no disc', 'error', etc. Changers will come up with similar
        display and then move on to the next position of the carousel or
        magazine.
     Center the focus offset within the range for which focus is stable if it
     was not already there.

     At this point there is a fair chance that the disc has started to spin
     and even that the disc directory has been displayed. If not, there are
     still two sets of adjustments remaining.

  9. With focus stable, the disc should spin up. It needs to reach and lock
     at about 500 rpm - roughly 8 revolutions per second. If it does not move
     or overspeeds, try adjusting the PLL/CLV control (may be called PLL.ADJ,
     VCO.FR, CLV.ADJ, etc.). NOTE: this assumes that the spindle motor and
     driver are in good condition. If there is any doubt, see the section:
     @{"Testing of motors" link "12.3"} WARNING: if the disc spindle speed runs away, turn
     power off and wait for spindle to stop completely. PLL/CLV control may
     be set to high; turn it counterclockwise 1/4 turn and start try again.
     There will be some range of this control where the speed will not run
     away but will be within the required limits.

     Now, these is an even better chance that the disc has started to spin
     and that the disc directory has been displayed. If not, there is still
     one set of adjustments remaining.

 10. Fine tracking offset may still not be quite right. Try some slight
     adjustments on either side of the current position. You may have to
     cycle power or open and close the drawer if you go too far. Some
     adjustments of alternately fine tracking offset and PLL/CLV may be
     needed.

     Hopefully, you now have a disc directory and play may be operations
     though perhaps with audio noise and/or skipping or sticking.

     The following are best done with a scope monitoring the 'Eye' pattern or
     other testpoints but if you do not have one, use your ears.

 11. Adjust PLL/CLV control to midpoint of range in which disc plays
     correctly. Test this at both the start and the end of a full length (74
     minute) disc. The optimal setting will result in the control being
     centered within the range over which the player works reliably at both
     ends of the disc.

 12. Adjust any RF Offset (RF.OFS) control to the midpoint of the range over
     which play continues normally with no audio noise.

 13. Set Focus Gain (FO.GAIN or FO.G) to the midpoint of the range over which
     it locks. CAUTION: the disc may enter a runaway state if you go to far.
     Check at both the beginning and end of the disc. Focus gain may need to
     be increased if the player is overly sensitive to bumps or disc wobble
     It may need to be decreased if sensitivity to disc defects is too high.

 14. Set Tracking Gain (TR.GAIN or TR.G) to the midpoint of range over which
     it locks. CAUTION: the disc may enter a runaway state if you go to far.
     Check at both the beginning and end of disc. Tracking gain may need to
     be increased if the player is overly sensitive to bumps or disc wobble.
     It may need to be decreased if sensitivity to disc defects is too high.

 15. Press STOP and then PLAY again to confirm that the disc loads properly
     and the directory comes up quickly and the music starts without
     excessive delay, hunting, or hesitation.

 16. Test forward and reverse search and seek functions for proper behavior.
     Some slight adjustments to tracking balance or fine tracking offset may
     be needed to equalize the forward and reverse search or seek speed.

 17. Player should now operate normally. However some tweaking of the gain
     controls may be necessary (as described above) for optimum defective
     disc and track seek performance over entire disc.

NOTE: if you have an oscilloscope capable of at least 5 MHz bandwidth, you
can optimize the amplitude and stability of the 'eye' pattern at the RF
testpoint by going back and touching up the focus and fine tracking
adjustments.

@endnode
@node 11.7 "Low laser power"

Indications of reduced laser power include erratic startup, noisy playback.
excessive variation of playback quality depending on the particular disc, or
total lack of startup.

WARNING: improper adjustment of the laser power may result in the absolutely
instant destruction of the laserdiode - the heart of your CD player. There
will be no warning. One moment you have a working laserdiode, the next you
have a DELD - Dark Emitting LaserDiode. Read the relevant sections fully
before attempting any adjustments.

Nothing will help a dead laserdiode - whether as a result of your efforts or
natural causes - short of replacing the optical pickup.

Very likely, low laser power indicates a sick laser as well and adjustments
will have limited if any effect since optical feedback normally maintains
laserdiode output at the proper level and it may be doing all that is
possible.

If you have the service manual and it provides a procedure not requiring a
laser power meter (which you probably do not have), then by all means follow
that procedure.

Otherwise, see the section @{"Laser power adjustment" link "14.8"} for procedures that may
be used as a last resort.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.8 "Optical alignment"

Unless the unit was dropped, optical realignment of the laser assembly is not
likely to be needed. All critical components are screwed, sealed with
loctite, or glued, and should not change alignment under normal use. Don't
fall for the line 'CD players are very delicate and will need frequent
alignment - buy our extended service plan'. CD players are remarkably robust.
Portables, even when nibbled on by large dogs, often survive unscathed. I
even carried a component type CD player home from a garage sale 5 miles on
the back of a 10 speed road bike over city streets complete with potholes! No
problems. In fact, it improved. The seller claimed that it was broken but I
could find nothing wrong! One possible exception is for automotive units
which are subjected constantly to bumps and vibration which eventually take
their toll.

If you really believe that optical alignment is needed, I strongly recommend
that you obtain the service manual. Special test discs or jigs may be
required and some test equipment will be required. As with other adjustments,
make sure you can get back to your starting point should the need arise.
Again, eliminate other possibilities first if possible.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


@endnode
@node 12.1 "Small motors in CD players"

Conventional miniature Permanent Magnet (PM) motors are usually used for:

   o Drawer/tray opening/closing.
   o Spindle rotation.
   o Pickup position (coarse tracking) unless the unit uses a linear motor or
     rotary positioner drive.
   o Disc changing (changers only).

These are DC motors with commutators and metal brushes and are very similar
in construction and quality to typical motors found in cameras, toys,
portable tools, and other electronic equipment like VCRs and audio cassette
decks.

They usually run on anywhere from a fraction of a volt up to 10 or 12 volts
DC on-off (e.g., drawer) or from a servo controller (spindle).

Some CD players and CDROM drives use brushless DC motors for spindle driver
rather that the cheap PM brushed variety. The commutation circuitry for these
may be external to the motor itself. Troubleshooting will probably require a
schematic.

Sled movement in high performance CD players and CDROM drives often uses
either a linear or rotary direct drive (voice coil) mechanism. Since these
are integral parts of the coarse tracking servo system, the only thing that
can be tested without a schematic is for coil continuity.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.2 "Problems with small PM motors"

These motors can fail in a number of ways:

   o Open or shorted windings - this may result in a bad spot, excess load on
     the driver, or a totally dead motor.

   o Partial short caused by dirt/muck, metal particle, or carbon buildup on
     commutator - this is a common problem with spindle motors which fail to
     reach proper startup speed.

   o Dry/worn bearings - this may result in a tight or frozen motor or a
     spindle with excessive runout.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.3 "Testing of motors"

If your player uses a brushless DC motor for the spindle then you may not be
able to perform any electrical tests as the commutation control may be
external on the circuit board somewhere. These do not fail very often,
either.

An open or shorted winding may result in a 'bad spot' - a position at which
the motor may get stuck. Rotate the motor by hand a quarter turn and try it
again. If it runs now either for a fraction of a turn or behaves normally,
then replacement will probably be needed since it will get stuck at the same
point at some point in the future. Check it with an ohmmeter. There should be
a periodic variation in resistance as the rotor is turned having several
cycles per revolution determined by the number of commutator segments used.
Any extremely low reading may indicate a shorted winding. An unusually high
reading may indicate an open winding or dirty commutator. Cleaning may help a
motor with an open or short or dead spot as noted below.

A motor can be tested for basic functionality by disconnecting it from the
circuit board and powering it from a couple of 1.5 volt alkaline cells in
series (3V). Sometimes, an erratic motor can be measured with an ohmmeter by
observing the resistance across its terminals while turning it slowly by
hand.  There should be a periodic variation in resistance determined by the
number of segments on the commutator. Any very asymmetric change in
resistance may signify a shorted or open segment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.4 "Reviving a partially shorted or erratic PM motor"

Dirt or grime on the commutator can result in intermittent contact and
erratic operation. Carbon or metal particle buildup can partially short the
motor making it impossible for the controller to provide enough voltage to
maintain desired speed. Sometimes, a quick squirt of degreaser through the
ventilation holes at the connection end will blow out the shorting material.
Too much will ruin the motor, but it would need replacement otherwise anyway.
This has worked on Pioneer PDM series spindle motors.

Another technique is to disconnect the motor completely from the electronics
and power it for a few seconds in each direction from a 9 V or so DC source.
This may blow out the crud. The long term reliability of both of these
approaches is unknown.

WARNING: Never attempt to power a motor with an external battery or power
supply when the motor is attached to the circuit board - you may blow
electronic components on the circuit board and complicate your problems.

It is sometimes possible to disassemble the motor and clean it more
thoroughly but this is a painstaking task best avoided if possible.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.5 "Motor bearing problems"

A dry or worn bearing can make the motor too difficult to turn properly or
introduce unacceptable wobble (runout) into the shaft as it rotates.

Feel and listen for a dry bearing:

The shaft may be difficult to turn or it may turn with uneven torque. A motor
with a worn or dry bearing may make a spine tingling high pitched sound when
it is turning under power. A drop of light machine oil (e.g. electric motor
oil) may cure a dry noisy bearing - at least temporarily.

For spindle motors (these are the only motors in CD players where runout is
critical), try wiggling the shaft from side-to-side - any detectable movement
is an indication of runout. At some point, this will be bad enough such that
the focus and tracking servos will be unable to compensate for the runout and
audio noise and skipping may result. Some oil may help but a spindle motor
with a worn bearing will require replacement eventually. Furthermore, it may
prove impossible to reach the bearing(s) to lubricate them properly.

See the section: @{"Spindle motor problems" link "12.6"} for more information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.6 "Spindle motor problems"

The following are some indications that the spindle motor may be defective or
need attention. However, insufficient spindle motor voltage or current could
also be due to spindle motor driver faults, incorrect power supply voltages,
or logic problems.

   o Focus is successful but disc does not spin (dead motor or dead spot on
     motor, shorted motor, bad connection).

   o Disc spins but at too slow a rate or is erratic or needs some help (weak
     motor or dead spot). Reading of disc directory may be erratic. (Try
     helping motor out by hand).

   o Voltage across spindle motor is only 1 V or less while attempting to
     spinup and read the directory and climbs to 5 V or more with the motor
     disconnected (partially shorted motor).

   o Spindle bearing runout is excessive (i.e., detectable by wiggling the
     spindle from side to side) or spindle motor bearing is dry or tight (try
     lubricating if possible).

   o Repetitive noise or dropouts at the disc rotation frequency or twice the
     disc rotation frequency. This may get worse toward the end or outer
     tracks of the disc. (Excessive spindle bearing runout or bad windings).

Check the motor before replacement (see the section:
@{"Small Motors in CD Players" link "12.1"}  for general motor problems and testing).
You should be able to easily confirm or eliminate the spindle motor as the
cause of your problems. If either of the cleaning or rejuvenation techniques
make a significant difference in performance, then the motor is almost
certainly at fault.

The spindle motor is often blamed for everything from long distance skipping
(coarse tracking problem) to disc spinning too fast or in wrong direction (a
control problem). Spindle motors do fail but they are not at the root of all
problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.7 "Spindle motor replacement"

Mark the height of the old spindle platter before you attempt to remove it.
The best approach is to make a shim that will fit between the bottom of the
spindle platter and the motor as a stop. The height is usually specified to a
precision of 1/10 of a mm. Too low or too high and the disc may rub. This is
probably overhill - 1/2 mm is probably good enough but try to get it as close
as possible. The focus servo offset adjustment will make up for any height
error in so far as focus is concerned.

The spindle is often press fit and difficult to remove without damage. It is
critical that when the spindle is replaced, it be mounted perfectly with no
wobble. If you can obtain a new spindle platter with the new motor, this is
the best option. If not, take every precaution to prevent damage to the
spindle platter during removal - even it it means destroying the old motor in
the process.

When press fitting the new spindle, the use of an arbor press or drill press
is highly recommended. Put a block of wood under the bottom of the motor and
your previously made shim between the spindle platter and the motor. Press
straight down - slowly and firmly. Err on the side of being to high and check
the height. Repeat until you get it perfect. It is much easier to press a
little more than to raise the height if you should go to far.

If there is a set screw, your job is much easier. Other mounting schemes may
be employed - use your judgement in replacement procedure. For non-press fit
installations, a drop of loctite or nail polish will reduce the chance of it
working loose.

@node 13.1 "Pioneer PDM series test mode"

The TEST mode available on some CD players is extremely useful for narrowing
down problems. The following are for the Pioneer PDM series of CD changers:

   o Press TEST while turning POWER ON to enable TEST mode. The TEST MODE
     button is located on the main board.

The servos can then be controlled from the front panel:

   o STOP turns all servos OFF.
   o TRACK FWD (>>|) enables FOCUS servo (and loads disc 1 in changer).
   o PLAY enables SPINDLE servo.
   o PAUSE enables TRACKING servo.
   o MANUAL SEARCH FWD (>>) or REV (<<) to move the optical pickup.

Power cycle to return to normal mode.

@node 13.2 "Pioneer spindle motor voltage (operating normally)"


        Spinup:                         >2.5 v.
        Time to lock (est):              1-2 sec.
 
        Start of disc (500 rpm):          1.0 v.
        End of disc (200 rpm):             .5 v.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.3 "Pioneer spindle motor problems"

When bad, spindle servo drive tops out at .6 V and 100 ma. Player is unable
to spin up to required 500 rpm to read disc directory.

While exact cause is unclear, theory is that large voltage applied at startup
followed by long periods of very low voltage (.5-2 V) operation allows
conductive crud (carbon) to build up on commutator eventually reducing
resistance to the point where the driver cannot apply enough voltage to
achieve 500 rpm.

A short squirt of degreaser through motor access hole had an immediate
dramatic effect returning operation to normal. It is not known how long this
will last. (Also see alternative procedure in section on @{"motors" link "12"}.)

Collateral symptom: Spindle motor servo drive IC becomes quite warm when
attempting to power shorted motor. However, it does not appear to be harmed.

Use TEST mode to play disc at outer track. If this is normal, then spindle
motor is probably bad as the rotation speed at the outer tracks is less (200
rpm) and a partially shorted motor may still run fast enough for this.

@endnode
@node 13.4 "Pioneer PD-M400/500/600 etc. servo adjustment procedure"

The following procedure assumes that unit is functional but internal controls
may have been moved from their correct position. This procedure has been
determined experimentally and is subject to change without notice. If you
have not touched the internal controls, there is no need to perform this
procedure. Use techniques and observations discussed elsewhere in this
document.

NOTE: this procedure also applies (with obvious changes) to many Pioneer
single disc players as well as other Pioneer manufactured equipment.

Assumptions:

   o Controls on the main board have been moved or are in an unknown state
     but not on the flex-cable or optical pickup assembly.

   o The player is otherwise functional - no physical damage.

  1. Set all the main board controls to their midpoint.

  2. Power up the unit in TEST MODE (hold down the TEST button while powering
     on.

  3. Adjust TR.BAL (Tracking Balance) to the center of the range over which
     the sled remains stationary. Outside this range, the pickup will slew to
     one end or the other.

  4. While monitoring TP1-6 (FO.ER, Focus Error) with a VOM or DVM, adjust
     FO.OFS (Focus Offset) for a reading of 0V +/- 10 MV. NOTE: I have found
     that on some players, this may not actually be quite optimal and fine
     adjustment be beneficial.

  5. While monitoring TP1-2 (TR.ER, Focus Error) with a VOM or DVM, adjust
     TR.OFS (Tracking Offset) for a reading of 0V +/- 10 MV. NOTE: I have
     found that on some players, this may not actually be quite optimal and
     fine adjustment be beneficial.

  6. Load a magazine with a disc in slot 1 and press >>|, TRACK SEARCH
     Forward. This should load the disc and enable focus servo.

  7. Use MANUAL SEARCH REV (<<) to position sled at beginning of disc.

  8. Press PLAY. This enables the spindle servo. Disc should now spin up and
     lock at at around 500 rpm. If disc does not start or appears not to
     reach correct speed, check voltage on spindle motor. It should be
     greater than 2.5 volts during spinup. The most common cause of low
     voltage is a dirty partially shorted commutator/brush assembly inside
     the motor; clean or replace as necessary. WARNING: if the disc spindle
     speed runs away, turn power off and wait for spindle to stop completely.
     VCO control may be set to high; turn counterclockwise 1/4 turn and start
     from the beginning.

  9. Press PAUSE. This locks the tracking servo. The display should show the
     disc TRACK and TIME. Alternately pressing >> or << should move pickup,
     then press PAUSE to start play again. Audio will be correct at output.
     Correct display and sound only near end of disc indicates a spindle
     motor unable to achieve sufficient speed (see above).

 10. Adjust the VCO control to the midpoint of range in which disc plays
     correctly.

 11. Set RF.OFS to the midpoint of the range over which play continues
     normally.

 12. Set FO.GAIN to midpoint of range over which it locks. CAUTION: the disc
     may enter a runaway state if you go to far. Check at both the beginning
     and end of the disc. FO.GAIN may need to be increased if the player is
     overly sensitive to bumps or disc wobble. It may need to be decreased if
     sensitivity to disc defects is too high.

 13. Set TR.GAIN to the midpoint of range over which it locks. CAUTION: the
     disc may enter a runaway state if you go to far. Check at both the
     beginning and end of the disc. TR.GAIN may need to be increased if the
     player is overly sensitive to bumps or disc wobble; it may need to be
     decreased if sensitivity to disc defects is too high.

 14. Press STOP. The disc should unload. Exit TEST MODE by turning power off
     and on again. Confirm that the disc loads properly and that the
     directory comes up quickly and the music starts without excessive delay,
     hunting, or hesitation.

 15. Test forward and reverse search and seek functions for proper behavior.
     Some slight adjustments to tracking balance or fine tracking offset may
     be needed to equalize the forward and reverse search or seek speed.

 16. The player should now operate normally. However some tweaking of the
     gain controls may be necessary (as described above) for optimum
     defective disc and track seek performance over entire disc.

NOTE: if you have an oscilloscope capable of at least 5 MHz bandwidth, you
can optimize the amplitude and stability of the 'eye' pattern at the RF
testpoint by going back and touching up the focus and fine tracking
adjustments.

@node 13.5 "Notes on Sony CDU31/33A CDROM drives"

Both these drives use similar optomechanical technology. The CDU31A is 1X
(though I have heard that some versions of this may be 2X, unconfirmed) and
CDU33A is 2X.

Many have complained about the lack of a motorized tray. What this does
provide is a very simple robust mechanical design. A solenoid latch keeps the
drawer shut. When the solenoid is activated (or the emergency release is
pressed) the drawer pops out about an inch. Pulling the rest of the way is
manual. The movement of the drawer clamps/unclamps the disc to the spindle
with a powerful magnet. Except from gross abuse, there is little to go wrong
mechanically.

There are only two major components: the Printed Wiring Board where all the
active electronics are located and the Optical Deck including laser, optics,
and pickup worm drive mechanism.

The other parts include the upper plastic casting and metal shroud, solenoid
latch assembly, right and left guide rails, drawer assembly, and front bezel,
two springs, bottom plate, 6 screws.

There are only two electrical connectors inside: one flat printed cable
linking the PWB and optical deck and a two pin connector supplying power to
the eject solenoid. This is in pleasant contrast to some other CDROM drives I
have seen with a half dozen or more small connectors spread all over the PWB
making removal and testing very difficult and risky.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.6 "Disassembling the Sony CDU31/33A CDROM drive"

The only major cautions are to not lose any of the small screws or springs
and to avoid damaging the multi-conductor flexible cable linking the
electronics to the optical assembly.

The following procedure takes about 5-10 minutes:

  1. Place the unit upside-down on a soft surface.

  2. Remove 4 philips head screws securing bottom cover. Set bottom cover
     aside.

     You will now have access to the electronic adjustments for focus,
     tracking, etc. If this is what you are after, no further disassembly is
     needed.

  3. Unclip the front bezel. Slide it out with the tray as far as it will go.
     You may need to manually activate the eject mechanism with a paperclip.

  4. Remove 2 philips screws securing Printed Wiring Board (PWB). Gently lift
     PWB and disconnect connector to latch solenoid assembly in front of
     unit.

  5. Gently lift PWB further and disconnect flexible cable connector on
     optical assembly. Mark the orientation so there will be no doubt about
     getting it correct if you need to reassemble on the workbench for
     testing. There is a latch at each end which you push away from the
     connector 1 mm or so. The cable will than come out easily.

     You now have partial access to the optical assembly sled drive. Cleaning
     and lubrication of these components is now possible.

  6. Lift the latch solenoid assembly up, remove and set aside.

  7. Using a pair of fine needlenose pliers or tweezers, disconnect and set
     aside the two tray retraction springs. Note their position and
     orientation.

  8. Remove the two plastic guides - one on each side. There are little tabs
     that you will need to depress and then lift each guide straight up.

  9. The entire deck can now be slid forward and lifted off. The
     opto/mechanical assembly can then be removed from the tray. Set the tray
     aside.

 10. If you prop up the PWB and reconnect the flexible cable - note the
     orientation marks you made previously - you can then run the drive with
     full visibility of the mechanism and optics. With a CD in place, there
     is no danger to you from the laser beam. Just make sure the PWB cannot
     short to anything and that the whole affair cannot tip over.

Reassemble in reverse order. Be especially careful reinstalling the flex
cable. Make sure no wires are being pinched and that nothing is obstructing
free movement of the optical pickup. This is actually pretty easy for this

@node 14.1 "Introduction"

Identifying front-end problems in CD players, CDROM drives, laserdisc
players, and other optical drives is often thought to be a mysterious and
difficult task. This section describes basic techniques confirming
functionality of the laserdiode, focus voice coil actuator, tracking voice
coil actuator, and photodiode array. No exotic test equipment is required.

It is strongly recommended that you read and become familiar with the other
information in this document. Don't immediately conclude that your problem is
in the optical pickup. It is likely elsewhere and you will not need to
undertake the testing described below.

If the unit is able to read the disc directory, if even erratically, then
these tests are unnecessary (unless you suspect an intermittent in one of
these subsystems) as all of major parts of the laser pickup assembly must be
properly functioning in order to do this. However, this does not guarantee
that there are not some marginal components such as a weak laserdiode or
shorted turns in the focus or tracking coil - more on these problems later.

Don't ignore the trivial: have you cleaned the lens? Sometimes a dirty lens
will result in symptoms that may be mistaken for much more serious problems.

For intermittents, first carefully inspect the pickup assembly for bad solder
connections and hairline cracks in the flexible printed cables. Interlock
switches may be dirty or worn. Mechanical problems may result in intermittent
behavior as well.

@node 14.2 "When and why to test the pickup"

If you have examined the 'RF Test Point' with a scope and found a proper 'eye
pattern', then as noted, these tests are not needed as this indicates proper
functioning of all the major components of the optical pickup. If, however,
any of the following are observed, then testing of the laserdiode, focus and
tracking actuators, and/or photodiode array is suggested:

   o The startup sequence does not complete due to obvious failure of the
     pickup to perform some action. For example, there is no attempt to
     focus.

   o Focus appears to be established but the directory is never displayed
     even though the disc spins at the correct speed - or overspeeds or does
     not spin in correct direction (clockwise as viewed from the label side
     is correct for CDs).

   o The 'eye pattern' is weak, distorted, or missing at the RF test point.

Try to eliminate alternative causes before undertaking these tests as there
is a slight chance of damage due to accidents or electrostatic discharge.

Will it be worth the time and effort? Only you can decide how much your time
is worth. There is a good chance that these tests will only confirm that the
pickup is dead - not many of the faults you will be able to locate have easy
fixes. You will learn something if that matters. However, with the cost of
new single disc CD players less than $70 and changers less than $100, any
rational analysis of the expected value for this undertaking may recommend
the dumpster. But, we all know that hobbiest's time is not worth much - as in
free.

@node 14.3 "Required tools, documentation, and test equipment"

Only a minimum of tools and test equipment are required for these testing
techniques to be effective. An oscilloscope is desirable but a VOM or DMM can
substitute in a pinch since no high frequency measurements are needed.
However, we will assume a scope is available. This section does not address
mechanical problems in the sled drive, or the drawer or spindle motors. These
problems are adequately handled in the elsewhere in this document. It is
assumed that these components have been verified to be functional as there
correct operation may be required for some of the tests described below.

A schematic will help greatly if available. Depending on the design of the
unit, you may be able to infer enough about the front-end electronics to get
away without one. The design of the components of the optical pickup are
sufficiently similar among manufacturers to make the tests relatively model
independent. What may differ are polarities of photodiodes, laser diodes,
connector pinouts, etc. These can usually be determined fairly easily.

Despite the incredible precision of the focus and tracking servos, we can
perform meaningful tests without sophisticated or specialized test equipment.

Also see the sections: @{"Troubleshooting tips" link "5.2"} and @{"Test equipment" link "5.3"}

The following tools and test equipment will be required:

  1. Basic hand tools including precision jeweler's screwdrivers.

  2. A VOM or DMM.

  3. An oscilloscope (for photodiode/RF tests). For most of the tests, almost
     any scope will do as long as it has a DC coupled vertical amp. As noted
     above, a scope is not essential but is highly desirable.

  4. A 0 to 5 volt variable DC power supply (400 mA). The power supply can be
     a 4-5 V 'wall wart' with a Variac. Alternatively (but not as desirable),
     you can use a fixed 5 V supply with a series adjustable resistor (100
     ohms for focus and tracking actuator testing, 250 ohms for laserdiode
     testing). A highly regulated supply is not needed.

  5. Resistors: 22 ohm 1W, 5 ohm 1W, 50 ohm, 1 M ohm.

  6. Assorted test clip leads, a few feet of #24 solid hookup wire (RS232
     quad or multiconductor phone cable is good source).

  7. IR detector circuit, IR detector card, or IR sensitive camcorder (for
     laserdiode tests).

  8. (Optional) Slow speed sweep or function generator (1-10 Hz) with low
     impedance output or amplifier, see text.

For the following discussions, a component CD player is assumed to be the
unit under test. Make appropriate adjustments in interpretation if it is a
portable CD player, CDROM drive, or optical drive.

@endnode
@node 14.4 "Precautions"

Reread the section: @{"Safety" link "5.1"} for your own protection.

To minimize the chances of damage to the laserdiode - which is extremely
sensitive to static and excess current - leave its connector plugged into the
main board as much as possible and do not attempt to test the laserdiode with
a VOM (which on the low ohms scale may exceed the current rating of the
laserdiode - poof, even if only for a microsecond.

As with all modern solid state equipment, preventing electrostatic discharges
to sensitive components is critical. An antistatic wrist strap is desirable.
In any case, work in an area where static is minimized - not on a carpet
prone to static. Make it a habit to touch the metal chassis first to
discharge yourself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.5 "Basic description of optical pickup"

Also see the more detailed description of the optical pickup components and
operation elsewhere in this document.

In order for information or music to be read off of a CD, several systems
must work closely together:

  1. Laser must be emitting a coherent beam of sufficient power and
     stability. Optical system must be clean and properly aligned. Laser
     power is maintained constant via an optical feedback loop controlling
     laserdiode current. Therefore, a weak laser may not be salvageable as
     the feedback loop may have done all that is possible.

  2. Photodiode sensors must be functioning correctly for data recovery and
     focus and tracking feedback. In a 'three beam pickup', there are six
     segments: the central segments A-D are used for focus and data recovery;
     the outer segments E and F are used for tracking feedback. In a 'single
     beam pickup' segments E and F are omitted.

  3. Lens must be focused to within a fraction of a um of optimal to produce
     a diffraction limited spot. This is less than 2 um in diameter at the
     disc 'pits'. The lens is actually positioned several mm from the disc
     surface and is maintained at the correct distance through optical
     feedback controlling the lens position using the focus coil. NOTE: um =
     micrometer = 10E-6 meter; mm = millimeter = 10E-3 meter. 1 meter is
     39.37 inches.

  4. Lens must align to within a fraction of a um of the center of the track.
     Tracks on a CD are spaced 1.6 um apart. Tracking is maintained via
     optical feedback controlling the radial lens position using the tracking
     coil (or radial positioning unit on some rotary positioners).

Note that if the behavior while the CD player is attempting to read the
directory changes whether a disc is in place or not, (and there is no
separate disc sensor), then some or all of these components are functioning
correctly. For example, many CD players will not attempt to rotate the
spindle until proper focus has been established. Thus, if the CD rotates when
in place but the bare spindle does not, it is likely - though not guaranteed
- that focus is being established successfully.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.6 "Testing the laserdiode while in the player"

Without a laser power meter, it will be difficult to fully verify laser
functionality. However, determining that IR is emitted will provide a
reasonable assurance of laser operation.

For this test you will need an IR detector. A simple circuit is described in
the "Notes on CD Technology and Repair of CD Players and CDROM Drives", This
unit is also useful for testing remote controls and other IR emitters. You
can also use an IR detector card - available at an electronics distributor.
In a pinch, CCD based camcorders are often sensitive to IR. It will appear as
a bright spot if the laser beam is projected onto a white paper screen.
However, you will probably need 3 or 4 arms to position the screen, push the
play button, and hold the camcorder while attempting to view the detected
spot through the viewfinder!

You will need to gain access to the lens. This may require the removal of the
clamper assembly.

Once this is accomplished prepare to position the photodiode of the IR tester
within 1/8" of the lens. Plug the unit in and turn it on. On portables, you
will need to defeat the door interlock - use a toothpick or bit of cardboard.
Sometimes a CD player will have a disc detect sensor separate from the laser
assembly - this will need to be defeated in order for this test to work
without a CD in place. If it is a simple optical sensor, a piece of black
tape or paper should suffice.

The first thing that should happen once a CD is in place and the play button
is pressed is for the laser to be powered. You should be able to detect this
in a darkened room because there is usually a very faint red appearing
emission which you can see as a tiny red dot of light if you look at the lens
from a safe distance of at least 6 inches at an oblique angle (WARNING: Do
not look directly into the lens from directly above as the invisible IR is
much stronger than the faint red emission and potentially hazardous). If you
see the faint red light, you know that at least power is being applied to the
laserdiode.

With the laser lit, the lens should go through a few focus search cycles -
between 2 and 8 typically. While it is doing this, position the IR detector
above the lens. If the laser is working, you will get a positive indication
of IR in about a 30 degree cone on either side of the lens. While you have no
way of knowing if the power output is correct, this is a reasonable
indication of laser operation. Due to the wide angle of the beam, the power
decreases rapidly with distance so you will need to be very close to the lens
for a positive result.

Note that if the lens moves smoothly in at least one direction (up or down),
you have also confirmed that the focus actuator is functional.

If the IR detector does not pick up a beam and you do not see the red dot,
then either the laserdiode is really dead or there is no power being applied
by the control circuits.

At this point, you have three options:

  1. You can give up. However, you would not have gotten this far if you were
     likely to be defeated so easily.

  2. You can attempt to obtain a schematic if you do not already have one so
     that you will be able to test the control circuits to determine if the
     laserdiode is being powered.

  3. You can perform some simple but risky tests on the laserdiode itself in
     an attempt to light it from an external power supply. As noted below,
     laserdiodes are easily destroyed and you will have no warning. One
     nanosecond it will be a laser - the next it might be a DED - Dark
     Emitting Diode.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.7 "Testing the laserdiode with an external power supply"

Consider the following only if there is no indication of laser output while
connected to the player and you do not have schematics or a service manual to
determine if the laser power circuits are functional.

Typical currents are in the 30-100 mA range at 1.7-2.5 V. However, the power
curve is extremely non-linear. There is a lasing threshold below which there
will be no output. For a diode rated at a threshold of 30 mA, the maximum
operating current may be as low as 40 mA. A sensing photodiode is built into
the same case as the laserdiode to regulate beam power. It is critical to the
life of the laserdiode that under no circumstances is the safe current
exceeded even for a microsecond!

Laserdiodes are also extremely sensitive to electrostatic discharge, so use
appropriate precautions. Also, do not try to test them with a VOM which could
on the low ohms scale exceed their safe current rating. Even connecting the
test leads can blow the laserdiode from static on a bad day. In addition,
always make or break power or test connections with the player turned off.

Locate the laser power connector by tracing back from the three pins on the
laserdiode assembly. NOTE: the following only applies if the laserdiode is
directly connected to the cable. If the power regulating circuit is on the
pickup, you will need to trace its circuit or obtain the schematic as there
are now too many variations to recommend a specific procedure.

Use the 0-5 VDC linear supply (a switching supply may put out laserdiode
destroying pulses) with a 50 ohm resistor in series with the diode. This is
preferred over the variable resistor power supply as there is less likelihood
of any potentially laser destroying overshoot or noise. If you do use the
variable resistor, make sure it is at its maximum resistance when you start
and that this is sufficient to keep the current under 20 mA. Keep in mind
that a wall wart rated at 5 V may actually put out 8 V or more when unloaded
- check the current into a short circuit before connecting the laserdiode.

Slowly bring the current up until you get a beam. Use an IR detector for
this!  If you get the polarity backwards or are actually measuring across the
internal photodiode, the voltage across the diode will go above 3 volts or
will be less than 1 V. Then, turn power off and reverse the leads. NOTE: some
laserdiodes will be destroyed by reverse voltage greater than 3 V - a spec
sheet will list the reverse voltage rating. The ones I have tried out of CD
players were fine to at least 5 V in the reverse direction.

Without a laser power meter, however, you will have no way of knowing when
the limit on safe beam power (safe for the laserdiode, that is) is reached.
For this test, increase the current only until you get an indication on the
IR detector or you see the red dot. You are not trying to measure power, just
to see if it works at all. A typical threshold is around 30 mA. Sometimes,
the operating current is marked on the pickup. If this is the case, do not
exceed this current.

If you detect a beam and there was none before, then your problem is most
likely located in the player's control or power circuits, not in the pickup.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.8 "Laser power adjustment"

If you have the service manual and it provides a procedure not requiring a
laser power meter (which you probably do not have), then by all means follow
that procedure.

As noted elsewhere, it is possible to destroy the laserdiode by attempting to
adjust its output power. However, if you suspect a weak laser as indicated by
noisy playback or poor tracking performance (not a dead one as this will not
help), and have exhausted all other possibilities such as the servo
adjustments - and feel you have nothing to lose, you may attempt one of the
following procedures with some risk to determine if the laserdiode is at
fault.

The following requires that you can play a disc - even if it has some
problems with noise or tracking.

   o If you have an oscilloscope, put a probe on the RF test point. While the
     disc is playing, you should see the eye pattern. Mark the exact
     amplitude of the peaks. Also, note the 'playback quality' so you will
     recognize if it changes.

     It may be safer to turn the laser power adjustment with player power off
     to avoid the possibility of electrical noise causing current spikes.
     Mark the exact position of the laser power adjustment so you can get
     back to it if there is no effect or it makes things worse.

     Turn the control the slightest amount clockwise. Turn power back on and
     note the eye pattern amplitude. If the laserdiode is not at the limit of
     its power and thus bad, you should see the amplitude change from what it
     was.

     Note the playback quality. Has it changed any? If not, then laser power
     is probably not your problem. If the amplitude of the eye pattern is
     unchanged, you either are turning the wrong control or the laser is at
     its power limit - and probably near the end of its life. Try the same
     test in the counterclockwise direction if the amplitude decreased - not
     every designer knows left from right.

     If there is improvement, you can risk leaving the control at the new
     (most likely) higher power setting realizing that you may be shortening
     the ultimate life of the laserdiode. Do not push your luck by continuing
     to turn up the power unless you have exhausted all other alternatives.

   o If you do not have an oscilloscope. you can still attempt the procedure
     above, using audio listening exclusively to determine if there is any
     change. It is just a little bit riskier.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.9 "Testing the focus and tracking actuators"

If there is a question of whether the lens is focusing or tracking properly,
perform the following. Again, if the unit is able to read the disc directory
at all, then these tests are not needed. Note that if you have a CD player
with a rotary positioner, there may be no separate tracking coil as coarse
and fine tracking may be combined.

First, identify the cable leading to the focus and tracking voice coil
mechanism. This is usually a 4 conductor cable separate from the data and
laser cable (at least at the pickup end). Disconnect it from the mainboard
before testing. Using a DMM or VOM, you should be able to locate a pair of
coils with very low resistance - a few ohms. One of these is focus coil and
the other is the tracking coil.

Construct one of the following test circuits:

  1. Your 4-5 V DC wall wart plugged into a Variac with its output connected
     to a 22 ohm 1W resistor in series with a pair of 2 foot #24 insulated
     wires.

  2. Your 5 V DC power supply connected in series with the 100 ohm variable
     resistor and 22 ohm 1W resistor with a pair of 2 foot #24 insulated
     wires.

Gain access to the lens for visual inspection. This may mean ejecting a disc,
opening the drawer, or in some cases, actually removing the clamper. In a
portable or boombox, the lens will be readily accessible. Unplug the CD
player from the wall or remove the batteries - you will not be using its
internal power.

Locate one pair of the two pairs of low resistance connections you identified
above. With your power supply off or the Variac turned all the way down,
connect the #24 leads to one of these pairs. Now, turn on the power and
slowly adjust the Variac or reostat while watching the lens. If you are
connected to the focus coil, you may see the lens moving up and down. If you
are connected to tracking coil, you may see it moving from side to side. If
there is no motion, turn off the power supply, reverse the polarity and try
again. For a typical pickup, the 4-5 V power supply and minimum of 22 ohms
should cause the lens to move through the entire range of motion up and down
or side to side as appropriate. Once you have exercised the first coil,
switch connections and repeat for the other. If the motion is jerky, the lens
assembly may be dirty. Clean it carefully first with a bit of compressed air
(not high pressure, a photographic air bulb is fine) and then with Q-tips and
isopropyl alcohol. Do not lubricate. Repeat the tests after the cleaning.

If both the tests are positive, you have confirmed operation of the focus and
tracking actuators. If either you were unable to locate both pairs of coils
or one or both actuators did not move, then you have located a problem. An
open coil can be due to a cable problem or a break at the coil. If the break
is right at the solder connections which are usually visible once the plastic
protective shroud is popped off, then it may be possible to repair it. This
will require a great deal of manual dexterity and patience - the wire is
really really fine.

It is still possible for there to be shorted turns in the fine coils or an
intermittent that was not detected.

   o Shorted turns would reduce the frequency response of the servo, reduce
     the reliability of focus or tracking, and increase the needed servo
     driver power. A CD player that is overly sensitive to slight disc
     defects even after all the proper adjustments have been performed may
     conceivably be a result of this type of fault. An additional symptom may
     be an unusually hot servo driver IC. However, many of these ICs run hot
     normally so don't panic as the possibility of shorted turns is really
     quite remote.

   o An intermittent may only show up during dynamic operation or with
     certain particularly finicky CDs or other peculiar circumstances. The
     intermittent could be at the solder connections or the fine printed
     ribbon cable that connects the moving lens assembly to the remainder of
     the pickup.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.10 "Testing the photodiode array"

The photodiode array in a optical pickup consists of an IC with typically 4
or 6 detector segments. Four segments may be used for the less common 'single
beam pickup' while 6 segments are used in the 'three beam pickup'.

These segments are usually designated A-F. A, B, C, and D are the main
detector which is used for both focusing and data recovery. Segments E and F
are used in a 'three beam pickup' for fine tracking feedback.

We will assume a three beam pickup for the remainder of this discussion.

All 6 photodiodes are connected to a common point which during operation has
a DC bias voltage on it typically around 5 V. If they are connected common
anode, it will be negative; if common cathode, it will be positive. The
reason is that the photodiodes need to be reverse biased for normal
operation.  The outputs of the photodiodes feed several operational
amplifiers which are set up to amplify the current from the photodiodes. The
normal connections may be at virtual ground potential or they may feed into
large value resistors.

The connector to the photodiode array is usually separate and will typically
have at least 8 wires - photodiodes A-F, ground, and bias voltage.

You will need to identify the wiring. First locate the ground using the
ohmmeter. Then locate the bias - it will probably go to a low value resistor
and then to the supply. Another way to identify the bias wire is to turn on
the player and measure each of the possibilities. The bias will be the
highest or lowest and will be solid with no noise or ripple. It will probably
be powered all the time.

Now for the photodiode segments. Very often the connections or some of the
connections are marked on the circuit board. For example, there may be
several labeled test points designated A+C, B+D, E, and F. Since the A and C
segments and B and D segments are usually shorted together on the circuit
board, this provided all the info needed to identify the photodiode
connections. It is not important to distinguish between A and C or B and D
for the following tests though you will want to be able to separate them.

With power off, there is essentially no light on the photodiode array. Unplug
the photodiode connector from the main board.

Using your ohmmeter, test each diode for opens and shorts as you would test
any signal diode. There should be a junction drop in the forward direction
and very high resistance in the reverse direction. If you are using a DMM
with a diode test mode, the junction drop will typically measure .7-.8 V.
There may be a very slight difference between the readings for segments A-D
and those for E and F.

Any unusual readings such as a significantly lower resistance for one of the
diodes, a short or open of a particular diode, or a short between diodes, is
an indication of a problem. While it is possible for there to be a cable or
soldering defect, this is somewhat unlikely though bad solder connections or
breaks in the flexible cables are not out of the question.

A defect found in the photodiode array will usually mean that the laser
pickup is not salvageable with reasonable effort. Even if you could locate a
replacement photodiode array, aligning and soldering the (most common)
surface mount package would be quite a challenge without the factory jigs.

Assuming these tests do not turn up anything, the next step will verify that
the photodiodes are picking up an optical signal and will evaluate the
relative strengths of each segment. For this, we will need to setup one of
the following. Method (2) is more straightforward but requires the optional
signal generator for best results. In each case the objective is to cause the
lens-disc distance to sweep through perfect focus without requiring that the
focus servo loop be closed. This will then result in a signal that will
include the point of maximum signal amplitude on a periodic basis.
Alternative methods may be used to accomplish the same purpose.

Both techniques require the adjustable power supply previously used to test
the focus coil.

  1. Adjustable focus with continuously rotating spindle. For the spindle
     motor, you will need a 1.5 V battery or your power supply with a
     suitable series resistor to cause the spindle to turn at approximately
     1-2 Hz (rps). WARNING: disconnect the motor from the mainboard! The
     unavoidable wobble of any disc is essential in this case and will sweep
     the focus distance by more than enough to cover the entire focus range
     of interest.

     NOTE: this assumes that the spindle is driven by a conventional PM DC
     motor. If it is a brushless DC motor, then some of the control
     electronics may be external to the motor and you will not be able to
     just provide a DC voltage to get it to rotate. If this is the case, you
     must use method #2.

  2. Stationary spindle but sweeping focus. This is the better method but
     requires a signal generator for easiest use. You can do this by hand
     using a Variac or reostat (this is easier if you have three functioning
     hands). A better method is to use a 1-10 Hz sinusoid or triangle wave
     from a low frequency signal generator with a low impedance output or
     feeding an emitter follower or audio amplifier to boost the current.
     This signal is then fed into the coil along with the focus offset
     derived from your power supply.

NOTE: it may be possible to dispense with these test setups and just use the
normal focus search of the CD player to provide the sweep. However, since we
will be interfering with the proper feedback by removing selected sensors,
there is no telling what the microcontroller will do. Therefore, breaking the
feedback loop as we are doing is preferred. If the CD player appears to make
many attempts at focus, this may be worth a shot, however.

You will also need a disc - preferably one you do not care much about as
sometimes it will get scratched due to opening the drawer accidentally or
something equally idiotic while the disc is still rotating.

Locate a 1 M ohm resistor and securely fasten it to a ground near the
photodiode connector. Put your scope probe on the other end with its ground
clipped to the same ground point as the resistor. Bend the free lead of the
resistor completely over so that it will be able to hold the end of a wire
like a mini-clip lead.

Make sure you remember or mark down exactly how the connector is wired so
that as you remove individual wires, you will be able to get them back in the
proper spot. Presumably, you have already made a diagram of the photodiode
connector wiring. Component players often have connectors with individually
removable socket pins. A fine jeweler's screwdriver or paper clip may prove
handy in removing these one at a time.

Turn on your power supply and adjust the focus to about midrange. Start the
spindle rotating or turn on the signal generator to provide a small sweep -
about 1/10 V p-p as measured on the coil should be fine.

Remove the wire corresponding to the photodiode (say, A) to be tested from
the connector but leave the connector itself plugged into the main board. Set
the scope for 1 V/div. vertical on a slow free running sweep.

Clip the A wire into the resistor. Now, turn on power to the CD player. While
the player thinks it is focusing, slowly adjust the focus voltage while
observing the scope. As you approach proper focus, you will see the signal
increase (depending on polarity) greatly, pass through a maximum, and then
decrease. Depending on the design of the CD player, you may need to turn it
off and on several times before you locate the signal as the microcontroller
may give up pretty quickly with no focus or tracking coil servos (since you
disconnected the actuators). If you have the service manual it may tell you
how to force the laser to be powered all the time. Leave the focus set near
the middle of the region of high signal.

If you are using the signal generator to perform the focus sweep, you may
need to optimize the amplitude of the signal by adjusting the signal
generator output and offset from your power supply.

You probably should not need to touch the settings for the remaining
photodiode segment tests.

Repeat the above procedure for each of the photodiodes A-F. All should
produce fairly similar signals, say within 20 % of one another in amplitude.
If A,B,C,D or E,F differ from one another by more than say, 20 %, there may
be a serious optical alignment problem in the pickup (the player may have
been dropped or bounced around without securing the hold-down screws, if
any).  Alternatively, the photodiode array may be bad. It is also possible
for there to be partially shorted photodiode segments in which case, the
outputs will not be independent as they should be. Loading one segment's
output with a resistor may affect the output of one or more other segments.

In any of these situations, such a discrepancy in A-D will prevent the
establishment of proper stable lens position at the optimal focal distance.
This will prevent the formation of a proper 'eye pattern' and subsequent data
recovery. A significant difference between E and F (beyond the adjustment
range of the tracking or E-F balance control) will prevent proper tracking.
Note, however, that the signal amplitude from A-D and E,F may differ as A-D
operate off of the main beam and E,F operate off of the first order
diffracted beams which are weaker. As with the basic photodiode tests above,
a failure here usually will require the replacement of the entire optical
assembly.

As noted, if the pickup's optical alignment is way off, there could be
significant differences in photodiode responses. On component type units, it
is unlikely that the optical alignment would shift on its own. Portables that
have been dropped or automotive units subject to constant bumps and vibration
could have alignment problems, however. If this is your last hope, then some
experimentation with adjustment of the optical alignment on a successive
approximation basis might be worth the effort. Mark the original position of
any adjustments and try small variations on either side to determine their
effect. You might get lucky. If this eventually results in improved
uniformity of photodiode response, alignment may be the problem. If you can
more or less equalize the response, reconnect the servos and attempt to get
an eye pattern. If you can, optimize the eye pattern stability and amplitude
using the optical alignment adjustments and servo adjustments.

@node 15.1 "What is oversampling?"

CD audio reads 16 bit samples off of the disc at a rate of 44.1 K samples per
second (for each channel). This is the 1X rate. It is possible to produce
PERFECTLY faithful sound reproduction at 1X. However, digital sampling theory
and the Nyquist criterion then require an analog filter which has a flat
frequency response in the audio passband - 20 Hz to 20 KHz, and 0 at 22.05
KHz (1/2 the sampling rate) and above. The filter is necessary to remove
'aliasing' artifacts which would produce frequencies in the output not
present in the original recording. Such filters are are possible but very
difficult to design and tend to have nasty phase response as you get near 20
KHz since the filter response needs to go from 1 to 0 within a very small
frequency range (20-22.05 KHz). The phase response may have an effect on
stereo imaging and instrument localization. Whether you can hear any of this
depends on whether you have 'golden ears' or not.

Enter oversampling. Instead of putting out the original CD samples at 44.1
KHz, digitally interpolate intermediate samples so that the D/A converter can
work at 2X, 4X, 8X or more. The digital filters can be designed with very
good performance and are part of the VLSI chipset in the CD player. For
example, with 4X oversampling, three interpolated samples will be inserted
between each original 44.1 KHz sample and the D/A will run at 176.4 KHz. An
analog antialiasing filter is still needed at the output but its response
only needs to go from 1 to 0 over the range 20 KHz to 88.2 KHz - a much much
easier filter to design.

Which will sound better? There is a lot of hype. It may depend more on the
quality of either design rather than the basic technique. So many other
factors enter into the ultimate listening experience that the difference in
in frequency and phase response around 20 KHz can easily be overshadowed by
errors introduced throughout the recording process as well as playback
considerations such as speaker quality and placement, room acoustics, and
listener location.

Most consumer grade CD players now use oversampling. The newest fad is the 1
bit D/A with 256X (or more) oversampling. This is largely cost driven as
well: you don't even need a high quality 16 bit D/A anymore. The simplest way
of describing this approach is that it is a combination of pulse width
modulation and sophisticated interpolation. The net result is audibly the
same as all the others.

@node 15.2 "Golden ears and technohype"

You have no doubt encountered various claims of how player A uses
such-and-such a technology and therefore clearly has superior sound compared,
no doubt, with all others in the explored universe. There may be people who
can hear such differences in noise, frequency response smoothness, and such.
Perhaps even you could hear a difference under ideal conditions. However,
once all the variables that make MUSIC are included - the chain from artist
and recording studio, microphones, recording, mixing, and resampling as well
as your speakers and room acoustics - not just sinusoids played in anechoic
or resonant chambers, the very slight differences between players are
virtually undetectable to human ears. If you are interested in playing test
discs all day, then worry about the last percentage point of noise floor or
frequency response. If you really want to enjoy the music, this stuff should
not bother you. There are more important things to worry about than an
undetectable blip in your CD player's frequency response curve. Anyhow, with
the introduction of the DVD technology pending, your carefully optimized
ultimate stereo system will be as obsolete a year from now as a 78 turntable.
Consider that! Only PC technology has a shorter lifespan. I bet you won't
sleep tonight.

I would be curious as to the results of any true double-blind listening tests
comparing CD players implemented with differing technologies (analog vs.
digital filters, 4X or 256X oversampling, 1 or 2 D/As, etc.) on actual music
(not test tones) in realistic listening environmemts. Such tests should be
with people who are interested in the overall musical experience and not just
the nth decimal point of technological specsmanship. There must, of course,
be no vested interests (financial or otherwise) in the outcome of such tests.
I would bet that the results of such tests would make for some fascinating
reading and surprises for some manufacturers of high-end audio equipment.

@node 16.1 "Advanced CD troubleshooting"

If the solutions to your problems have not been covered in this document, you
still have some options other than surrendering your CD player to the local
service center or the dumpster.

When tackling electronic faults, a service manual with schematics will prove
essential. Many manufacturers will happily supply this for a modest cost -
$10 to $50 typical. However, some manufacturers are not providing schematics
- only mechanical and alignment info. Confirm that a schematic (not just a
block diagram) is included if you need one before purchasing the manual.

Howard Sams publishes Sams Photofacts service data for almost every model TV
that has ever been sold but their selection of CDfacts is nearly if not
totally nonexistent.

Test point locations, important signals, and power supply voltages are often
clearly labeled on the electronics board. In this case, quite a bit of
troubleshooting can be done without the schematic. There is a good chance
that the problem can be isolated to a particular subsystem by just following
the signals using this information.

Whatever the ultimate outcome, you will have learned a great deal. Have fun -
don't think of this as a chore. Electronic troubleshooting represents a
detective's challenge of the type hat Sherlock Holmes could not have
resisted.  You at least have the advantage that the electronics do not lie or
attempt to deceive you (though you may beg to differ at times). So, what are
you waiting for?

@node 16.3 "Rubber belts in CD players"

The type of belts used in CD players for drawer loading and sometimes
elsewhere is nearly always a type with a square cross section. Obtaining an
exact replacement belt may be difficult and not really necessary.

Measure the old belt and select one from a parts supplier like MCM
Electronics which is as close as possible - equal or slightly greater
thickness and an inside circumference (this is how they are measured) such
that it will be tight but not so tight as to slow the motor or cause damage
to the bearings. This usually means about 5 to 10 percent less than the old
(stretched) belt.

@endnode
@node 16.4 "Interchangeability of electronic and mechanical components"

The question often arises: If I cannot obtain an exact replacement or if I
have a CD, VCR, or other equipment carcass gathering dust, can I substitute a
part that is not a precise match? Sometimes, this is simply desired to
confirm a diagnosis and avoid the risk of ordering an expensive replacement
and/or having to wait until it arrives.

For safety related items, the answer is generally NO - an exact replacement
part is needed to maintain the specifications within acceptable limits with
respect to line isolation, X-ray protection and to minimize fire hazards.
However, these components are rare in CD players.

Although only a few manufacturers produce most of the components in CD
players and CDROM drives, don't expect a lot of readily interchangeable parts
other than the common electronic ones listed below. In their never ending
search for cost reductions and technology improvements, manufacturers are
constantly tweaking their designs. More and more circuitry is finding its way
into custom VLSI chips. Fortunately, these do not fail too often.

The only parts that are fairly standardized aside from the electronic
components are motors. Often, if the motor is physically interchangeable,
then it will work as a replacement. Electronic components and entire circuit
boards (if identical models and production run) can often be substituted
without difficulty though servo alignment will probably be needed due to
slight unavoidable differences between apparently identical pickups or
electronic components.

For common components, whether a not quite identical substitute will work
reliably or at all depends on many factors. Except for the optical pickup,
non-custom components in CD players are fairly standard.

Here are some guidelines:

  1. Fuses - exact same current rating and at least equal voltage rating. I
     have often soldered a normal 3AG size fuse onto a smaller blown 20 mm
     long fuse as a substitute.

  2. Resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, switches, potentiometers,
     LEDs, and other common parts - except for those specifically marked as
     safety-critical - substitution as long as the replacement part fits and
     specifications should be fine. It is best to use the same type - metal
     film resistor, for example. But for testing, even this is not a hard and
     fast rule and a carbon resistor should work just fine.

  3. Rectifiers - replacements should have at equal or better PRV and Imax
     specifications. For power supply rectifiers, 1N400x types can usually be
     used.

  4. Transistors - substitutes will generally work as long as their
     specifications meet or exceed those of the original. For testing, it is
     usually ok to use types that do not quite meet all of these as long as
     the BVceo and Ic specifications are not exceeded. However, performance
     may not be quite as good. For power types, make sure to use a heatsink.

  5. Motors - small PM motors may be substituted if they fit physically.
     Brushless DC spindle motors are not usually interchangeable.

  6. Sensors - many are sufficiently similar to permit substitution.

  7. Power transformers - in some cases, these may be sufficiently similar
     that a substitute will work. However, make sure you test for compatible
     output voltages to avoid damage to the regulator(s) and rest of the
     circuitry.

  8. Belts - a close match should be good enough at least to confirm a
     problem or to use until the replacements arrives.

  9. Mechanical parts like screws, flat and split washers, C- and E-clips,
     and springs - these can often be salvaged from another unit.

 10. Optical pickups - see the section:
     @{"Interchangeability of components in the optical pickup" link "16.5"}

The following are usually custom parts and substitution of something from
your junk box is unlikely to be successful even for testing:
microcontrollers, other custom programmed chips, display modules, and entire
optical pickups, optical decks, or power supplies unless identical.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 16.5 "Interchangeability of components in the optical pickup"

Once you have located a problem in the optical pickup, what should you do?
For parts like laserdiodes and photodiode arrays, there are probably too many
variables to consider and the labor and risks involved - even for the
do-it-yourselfer - would likely be unacceptably high. As an example, the
laserdiode, which is an expensive component you might be tempted to attempt
replacing with one from another pickup (1) may not fit physically, (2) may
have different polarity laserdiode and photodiode inside the case, (3) may
have a very different threshold current and safe operating current, and (4)
may have a different optical alignment with respect to any index marks. Any
of these would likely make the interchange virtually impossible. Even
replacement with an identical laserdiode would prove challenging without the
optical alignment jigs and specialized test equipment.

The only breakdown below the pickup level that I would consider as having a
reasonable chance of success would be to swap the lens assembly including
focus and tracking coils between identical pickups. The optical alignment is
not supercritical at this point. However, optical and servo alignment might
be needed after this exchange.

If you have narrowed the problem down to the pickup and you have an identical
pickup which you believe to be functional, the best bet is to exchange the
entire pickup as a unit. Only minimal servo system alignment would likely be
needed after such a replacement. The only optical adjustment needed might be
the setting making the beam perpendicular to the disc surface - often a
hexagonal nut on the bottom of the deck. The only cautions are to be careful
with respect to static discharge which could destroy the laserdiode, take
care not to rip any of the fine ribbon or other electrical cables, and avoid
damaging the delicate lens assembly. However, you will probably wish you had
that friendly unemployed Swiss Watchmaker for your assistant.

Better yet is to replace the entire optical deck as a unit. This is a lot
less work and there is no risk of optical alignment problems at all. Then,
only servo alignment may be needed.

@node 16.6 "Recommended parts suppliers"

For general electronic components like resistors and capacitors, most
electronics distributors will have a sufficient variety at reasonable cost.
Even Radio Shack can be considered in a pinch.

However, for consumer electronics equipment repairs, places like Digikey,
Allied, and Newark do not have the a variety of Japanese semiconductors like
ICs and transistor or any components like flyback transformers or even
degauss Posistors.
