@node 2.1 "The switchmode power supply (SMPS)"

Until the 1970s or so, most consumer electronic equipment used a basic power
transformer/rectifier/filter capacitor type of power supply for converting
the AC line into the various voltages needed by internal circuitry. Even
regulation was present only where absolutely needed - the high voltage
supplies of color TV sets, for example. Remember those old TVs with boat
anchor type power transformers? (Of course, if you recall those, you also
recall the fond days of vacuum tube sets and the corner drugstore with a
public tube tester!)

Switchmode supplies had been commonplace in military and avionic equipment
long before they found their way into consumer electronics. I have some DC-DC
and DC-AC convertor modules from a Minuteman I missile from around 1962 as
one example. I suppose that the cost of the switching transistors wasn't as
big a deal with a $100 million missile as a $300 TV (even in 1960s dollars).

Nowadays, all TVs, monitors, PCs; most laptop and camcorder power packs; many
printers, fax machines, and VCRs; and even certain audio equipment like
portable CD players use this technology to reduce cost, weight, and size.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.2 "Switchmode power supply repair"

Unlike PC system boards where any disasters are likely to only affect your
pocketbook, power supplies, especially line connected switchmode power
supplies (SMPSs) can be dangerous. Read, understand, and follow the set of
safety guidelines provided later in this document whenever working on line
connected power supplies as well as TVs, monitors, or other similar high
voltage equipment.

Having said that, repairing a power supply yourself may in fact be the only
economical option. It is very common for service centers to simply replace
the entire power supply board or module even if the problem is a 25 cent
capacitor. It may simply not pay for them to take the bench time to diagnose
down to the component level. Many problems with switchmode power supplies are
easy to find and easy and inexpensive to fix. Not all, but surprisingly many.

This document will provide you with the knowledge to deal with a large
percentage of the problems you are likely to encounter with the common small
switchmode power supplies found in many types of consumer electronic
equipment including PCs, printers, TVs, computer monitors, and laptop or
camcorder power packs. It will enable you to diagnose problems and in many
cases, correct them as well. With minor exceptions, specific manufacturers
and models will not be covered as there are so many variations that such a
treatment would require a huge and very detailed text. Rather, the most
common problems will be addressed and enough basic principles of operation
will be provided to enable you to narrow the problem down and likely
determine a course of action for repair. In many cases, you will be able to
do what is required for a fraction of the cost that would be charged by a
repair center - assuming they would even bother.

Should you still not be able to find a solution, you will have learned a
great deal and be able to ask appropriate questions and supply relevant
information if you decide to post to sci.electronics.repair. It will also be
easier to do further research using a repair text such as the ones listed at
the end of this document. In any case, you will have the satisfaction of
knowing you did as much as you could before taking it in for professional
repair. With your new-found knowledge, you will have the upper hand and will
not easily be snowed by a dishonest or incompetent technician.

@node 2.3 "Most Common Problems"

The following probably account for 95% or more of the common SMPS ailments:

   o Supply dead, fuse blown - shorted switchmode power transistor and other
     semiconductors, open fusable resistors, other bad parts.

   o Supply dead, fuse not blown - bad startup circuit (open startup
     resistors), open fusable resistors (due to shorted semiconductors), bad
     controller components.

   o One or more outputs out of tolerance or with excessive ripple at the
     line frequency (50/60 Hz) or twice the line frequency (100/120 Hz) -
     dried up main filter capacitor(s) on rectified AC input.

   o One or more outputs out of tolerance or with excessive ripple at the
     switching frequency (10s of KHz typical) - dried up or leaky filter
     capacitors on affected outputs.

   o Audible whine with low voltage on one or more outputs - shorted
     semiconductors, faulty regulator circuitry resulting in overvoltage
     crowbar kicking in, faulty overvoltage sensing circuit or SCR, faulty
     controller.

   o Periodic power cycling, tweet-tweet, flub-flub, blinking power light -
     shorted semiconductors, faulty over voltage or over current sensing
     components, bad controller.

In all cases, bad solder connections are a possibility as well since there
are usually large components in these supplies and soldering to their pins
may not always be perfect. An excessive load can also result in most of these
symptoms or may be the original cause of the failure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.4 "Repair or replace"

Some manufacturers have inexpensive flat rate service policies for power
supplies. If you are not inclined or not interested in doing the diagnosis
and repair yourself, it may be worthwhile to look into these. In some cases,
$25 will get you a replacement supply regardless of original condition.
However, this is probably the exception and replacements could run more than
the total original cost of the equipment - especially as in the case of most
TVs and many computer monitors, where the power supply is built onto the main
circuit board.

Nothing really degrades in a switchmode power supply except possibly the
electrolytic capacitors (unless a catastrophic failure resulted in a total
meltdown) and these can usually be replaced for a total cost of a few
dollars. Therefore, it usually makes sense to repair a faulty supply assuming
it can be done reasonably quickly (depending on how much you value your time
and the down time of the equipment) and, of course, assuming that the
equipment it powers is worth the effort. Most replacement parts are readily
available and kits containing common service components are also available
for many popular power supplies (such as those found in some terminals,
MacIntosh and other Apple computers, various brands of video monitors, and
some TVs and VCRs).

@node 3.1 "Power Supply Fundamentals"

A typical line connected power supply must perform the following functions:

   o Voltage conversion - changing the 115/230 VAC line voltage into one or
     more other voltages as determined by application.

   o Rectification - turning the AC into DC.

   o Filtering - smoothing the ripple of the rectified voltage(s).

   o Regulation - making the output voltage(s) independent of line and load
     variations.

   o Isolation - separating the supply outputs from any direct connection to
     the AC line.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 3.2 "Linear power supplies (LPSs)"

A typical linear power supply of the type found in most audio equipment
includes a line power transformer which converts the 115/230 VAC 50/60 Hz to
other (usually lower) voltages (now that most equipment has done away with
vacuum tubes except for CRTs, more on that later). The power transformer also
provides the isolation between the load and the line. The outputs are
rectified by a diode bridge or other solid state configuration. Filtering is
accomplished with electrolytic capacitors and sometimes inductors or
resistors arranged as a low pass filter C-L-C (pi) or C-R-C or other
configuration.

Where regulation is important - that is, it is desirable for the output
voltage to be relatively independent of line or load variations, a regulator
stage is added. This may take the form of a Zener diode if the current
requirements are modest, discrete transistor circuit, or an integrated 3
terminal regulator like an LM317 (variable), 7805 (+5), or 7912 (-12). There
are many more as well as linear regulators for higher voltages such as +115
VDC or +125 VDC for TV power supplies and multiple output (e.g., +5.1 VDC,
+12 VDC) hybrid regulators for VCRs.

The regulator circuit essentially compares the output (possibly only one if
there are multiple outputs in the same package) with a reference and adjusts
the current flow to make the output(s) as nearly equal to the desired voltage
as possible. However, a significant amount of power may be lost in the
regulator especially under high line voltage/high load conditions. Therefore,
the efficiency of linear power supplies is usually quite low - under 50%
overall is typical.

Notable characteristics of LPSs are excellent regulation and low output
ripple and noise.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 3.3 "What is a switch mode power supply?"

Also called switching power supplies and sometimes chopper controlled power
supplies, SMPSs use high frequency (relative to 50/60 Hz) switching devices
such as Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), MOSFETs, Insulated Gate Bipolar
Transistors (IGBTs), or Thyristors (SCRs or triacs) to take directly
rectified line voltage and convert it to a pulsed waveform.

Most small SMPSs use BJTs or MOSFETs. IGBTs may be found in large systems and
SCRs or triacs are used where their advantages (latching in the on state and
high power capability) outweigh the increased complexity of the circuitry to
assure that they turn off properly (since except for special Gate Turn Off
(GTO) thyristors, the gate input is pretty much ignored once the device is
triggered and the current must go to zero to reset it to the off state.)

The input to the switches is usually either 150-160 VDC after rectification
of 115 VAC, or 300-320 VDC after doubling of 115 VAC or rectification of
220-240 VAC. Up to this point, there is no line isolation as there is no line
connected (large, bulky, heavy) power transformer.

A relatively small high frequency transformer converts the pulsed waveform
into one or more output voltages which are then rectified and filtered using
electrolytic capacitors and small inductors in a 'pi' configuration C-L-C, or
for outputs that are less critical, just a capacitor.

This high frequency transformer provides the isolation barrier and the
conversion to generate the multiple voltages often provided by a SMPS.

Feedback is accomplished across the isolation barrier by either a small pulse
transformer or opto-isolator. The feedback controls the pulse width or pulse
frequency of the switching devices to maintain the output constant. Since the
feedback is usually only from the "primary" output, regulation of the other
outputs, if any, is usually worse than for the primary output. Also, because
of the nature of the switching designs, the regulation even of the primary
output is usually not nearly as good both statically and dynamically as a
decent linear supply.

DC-DC convertors are switchmode power supplies without the line input
rectification and filtering. They are commonly found in battery operated
equipment like CD players and laptop computers. They have similar advantages
to SMPSs in being compact, light weight, and highly efficient.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node 3.4 "Description of typical flyback type SMPS"

Probably the most common topology for small switchers is the flyback circuit
shown below:


       CR1                             CR2            L 
H o----|>|---+----+---------+ T1 +-----|>|------+---CCCCC---+---+----o V+

             |    +-----+--------|  PWM  |<--| Isolation |<--| REF |
             |       Q1 |\       +-------+   +-----------+   +-----+
             |            | 
N o----------+------------+

The input to the supply is the AC line which may have RFI and surge
protection (not shown). There may be several inductors, coupled inductors,
and capacitors to filter line noise and spikes as well as to minimize the
transmission of switching generated radio frequency interference back into
the power line. There may be MOV type of surge suppressors across the three
input leads (H, N, G). A line fuse is usually present as well to prevent a
meltdown in case of a catastrophic failure. It rarely can prevent damage to
the supply in the event of an overload, however.

Line rectification is usually via a voltage doubler or diode bridge. One
common circuit uses a bridge rectifier as a doubler or normal bridge by
changing one jumper. The voltage across the switching transistor is usually
around 150-300 V. Some universal supplies are designed to accept a wide range
of input voltages - 90-240 VAC (possibly up to 400 Hz or more) or DC - and
will automatically work just about anywhere in the world as long as a
suitable plug adapter can be found.

When Q1 turns on, current increases linearly in T1 based on the voltage
applied and the leakage inductance of T1's primary winding. Little power is
transferred to the secondary during this phase of the cycle. When Q1 turns
off, the field collapses and this transfers power to the output. The longer
Q1 is on, the more energy is stored (until saturation at which point it blows
up). Thus, controlling the pulse width of the Q1 on-time determines the
amount of power available from the output.

The output rectifier, CR2, must be a high efficiency, high frequency unit - a
1N400X will not work. The pie filter on the output smooths the pulses
provided by CR2. Sometimes, a full wave configuration is used with a center
tapped transformer secondary.

Note that the transformer, T1, is a special type which includes an air gap in
its core (among other things) to provide the inductive characteristics needed
for operation in flyback mode.

Multiple output windings on T1 provide for up to a half dozen or more
separate (and possibly isolated as well) positive or negative voltages but as
noted, only one of these is usually used for regulation.

A reference circuit monitors the main output and controls the duty cycle of
the switching pulses to maintain a constant output voltage. (Secondary
outputs are not shown in the above schematic.)

R1 is the startup resistor (some startup circuits are more sophisticated) and
provides the initial current to the switchmode transistor base. The PWM
circuit guarantees that Q1 will not be turned on continuously.

Many small SMPSs use opto-isolators for the feedback. An opto-isolator is
simply an LED and a photodiode in a single package. As its name implies, an
opto-isolator provides the isolation barrier (between the low voltage
secondary outputs and the line connected primary) for the feedback circuit.
Typically, a reference circuit on the output side senses the primary output
voltage and turns on the LED of the opto-isolator when the output voltage
exceeds the desired value. The photodiode detects the light from the LED and
causes the pulse width of the switching waveform to be reduced enough to
provide just the right amount of output power to maintain the output voltage
constant. This circuit may be as simple as putting the photodiode across the
base drive to the BJT switch thus cutting it off when the output voltage
exceeds the desired value. The reference is often a TL431 or similar shunt
regulator chip monitoring a voltage divided version of the primary output.
When the shunt regulator kicks in, the opto-isolator LED turns on reducing
the switchmode transistor drive. There may be an adjustment for the output
voltage.

Other designs use small pulse transformers to provide isolated feedback.

Where additional regulation is needed, small linear regulators may be
included following the output(s).

There are many other topologies for switching power supplies. However, the
basic principles are similar but the detail differ depending on application.
The flyback topology described above is one of the most common for small
multi-output supplies. However, you may find other types of circuits in TVs
and monitors. Some are downright strange (to be polite). I sometimes wonder
if engineers are given bonuses based on the uniqueness and difficulty level
of understanding their designs!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 3.5 "Advantages of SMPSs compared to LPSs"

The benefits provided by implementing switch mode operation are with respect
to size, weight, and efficiency.

   o Size and weight - since the transformer and final filter(s) run at a
     high frequency (we are talking about 10KHz to 1 MHz or more), they can
     be much smaller and lighter than the big bulky components needed for
     50/60 Hz operation. Power density for SMPSs compared to LPSs may easily
     exceed 20:1.

   o Efficiency - since the switching devices are (ideally) fully on or fully
     off, there is relatively little power lost so that the efficiency can be
     much higher for SMPSs than for LPSs, especially near full load.
     Efficiencies can exceed 85% (compared to 50-60% for typical LPSs) with
     improvements being made continuously in this technology.

Since the advent of the laptop computer, cellular phone, and other portable
devices, the importance of optimizing power utilization has increased
dramatically. There are now many ICs for controlling and implementing SMPSs
with relatively few external components. Maxim, Linear Technology, and
Unitrode are just a few of the major manufacturers of controller ICs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 3.6 "Where are SMPSs used?"

Switch mode power supplies are commonly used in computer and other digital
systems as well as consumer electronics - particularly TVs and newer VCRs
though audio equipment will tend to use linear power supplies due to noise
considerations. You will find SMPSs in:

   o PCs, workstations, minicomputers, large computers.

   o Laptop and notebook computers, PDAs - both internal DC-DC convertors and
     their AC power packs.

   o Printers, fax machines, copiers.

   o Peripheral and expansion boxes

   o X-terminals and video terminals, point of sale registers.

   o TVs, computer and video monitors.

   o Many VCRs.

   o Camcorder AC adapters.

In additional, you will find DC-DC converters which are SMPSs without the AC
line connection, internally in an increasing number of consumer and
industrial applications including things like portable CD players.

The up side is that they are usually quite reliable, efficient, and cool
running.

The down side is that when a failure occurs, it may take out many parts in
the supply, though not usually the equipment being powered unless the
feedback circuitry screws up and there is no overvoltage protection.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.1 "SAFETY"

The primary danger to you is from the input side of the supply which is
directly connected to the AC line and will have large electrolytic capacitors
with 300 V or greater DC when powered (often, even if the supply does not
work correctly) and for some time after being unplugged (especially if the
power supply is not working correctly but does not blow fuses).

WARNING: the filter capacitors used in many switchmode power supplies can
store an amount of energy that can kill - always discharge and confirm this
before touching anything.

There is also risk of instantly destroying expensive parts of the supply (and
any attached equipment as well) like the switchmode power transistor if your
probe should slip and short something either directly or by killing the
feedback circuit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.2 "Safety guidelines"

These guidelines are to protect you from potentially deadly electrical shock
hazards as well as the equipment from accidental damage.

Note that the danger to you is not only in your body providing a conducting
path, particularly through your heart. Any involuntary muscle contractions
caused by a shock, while perhaps harmless in themselves, may cause collateral
damage - there are many sharp edges inside this type of equipment as well as
other electrically live parts you may contact accidentally.

The purpose of this set of guidelines is not to frighten you but rather to
make you aware of the appropriate precautions. Repair of TVs, monitors,
microwave ovens, and other consumer and industrial equipment can be both
rewarding and economical. Just be sure that it is also safe!

   o Don't work alone - in the event of an emergency another person's
     presence may be essential.

   o Always keep one hand in your pocket when anywhere around a powered
     line-connected or high voltage system.

   o Wear rubber bottom shoes or sneakers.

   o Don't wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact
     circuitry and conduct current, or get caught in moving parts.

   o Set up your work area away from possible grounds that you may
     accidentally contact.

   o Know your equipment: TVs and monitors may use parts of the metal chassis
     as ground return yet the chassis may be electrically live with respect
     to the earth ground of the AC line. Microwave ovens use the chassis as
     ground return for the high voltage. In addition, do not assume that the
     chassis is a suitable ground for your test equipment!

   o If circuit boards need to be removed from their mountings, put
     insulating material between the boards and anything they may short to.
     Hold them in place with string or electrical tape. Prop them up with
     insulation sticks - plastic or wood.

   o If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits with power
     off, discharge (across) large power supply filter capacitors with a 2 W
     or greater resistor of 5-50 ohms/V approximate value (e.g., for a 200 V
     capacitor, use a 1K-10K ohm resistor). Monitor while discharging and/or
     verify that there is no residual charge with a suitable voltmeter. In a
     TV or monitor, if you are removing the high voltage connection to the
     CRT (to replace the flyback transformer for example) first discharge the
     CRT contact (under the insulating cup at the end of the fat red wire).
     Use a 1M-10M ohm 1W or greater wattage resistor on the end of an
     insulating stick or the probe of a high voltage meter. Discharge to the
     metal frame which is connected to the outside of the CRT.

   o For TVs and monitors in particular, there is the additional danger of
     CRT implosion - take care not to bang the CRT envelope with your tools.
     An implosion will scatter shards of glass at high velocity in every
     direction. There is several tons of force attempting to crush the
     typical CRT. Always wear eye protection.

   o Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered and
     unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped
     locations or difficult to access locations.

   o If you must probe live, put electrical tape over all but the last 1/16"
     of the test probes to avoid the possibility of an accidental short which
     could cause damage to various components. Clip the reference end of the
     meter or scope to the appropriate ground return so that you need to only
     probe with one hand.

   o Perform as many tests as possible with power off and the equipment
     unplugged. For example, the semiconductors in the power supply section
     of a TV or monitor can be tested for short circuits with an ohmmeter.

   o Use an isolation transformer if there is any chance of contacting line
     connected circuits. A Variac(tm) is not an isolation transformer! The
     use of a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet is a
     good idea but will not protect you from shock from many points in a line
     connected TV or monitor, or the high voltage side of a microwave oven,
     for example. (Note however, that, a GFCI may nuisance trip at power-on
     or at other random times due to leakage paths (like your scope probe
     ground) or the highly capacitive or inductive input characteristics of
     line powered equipment.) A fuse or circuit breaker is too slow and
     insensitive to provide any protection for you or in many cases, your
     equipment. However, these devices may save your scope probe ground wire
     should you accidentally connect it to a live chassis.

   o Don't attempt repair work when you are tired. Not only will you be more
     careless, but your primary diagnostic tool - deductive reasoning - will
     not be operating at full capacity.

   o Finally, never assume anything without checking it out for yourself!
     Don't take shortcuts!

@node 4.3 "SMPS troubleshooting"

The diagnosis of problems in switchmode power supplies is sometimes made
complicated due the interdependence of components that must function properly
for any portion of the power supply to begin to work. Depending on design,
SMPS may or may not be protected from overload conditions and may fail
catastrophically under a heavy load even when supposedly short circuit proof.
There is particular stress on the switching devices (they are often 800 V
transistors) which can lead to early or unexpected failure. Also, SMPS may
fail upon restoration of power after a blackout if there is any kind of power
spike since turn-on is a very stressful period - some designs take this into
account and limit turn on surge.

However, the cause of many problems are immediately obvious and have simple
fixes - the blown chopper transistor or dried up main filter capacitor. Don't
assume your problem is complex and convoluted. Most are not. You should not
avoid attempting a repair just because there is a slight chance it will be
more challenging!

@endnode
@node 4.4 "Test equipment"

The most valuable piece of test equipment (in addition to your senses) will
be a DMM or VOM. These alone will suffice for most diagnosis of faulty
components (like shorted semiconductors or open fusable resistors).

In designs using controller ICs, an oscilloscope comes in handy when there
are startup or overcurrent/voltage shutdown or cycling problems. Since
everything runs at a relatively low frequency, almost any scope will do.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.5 "Incredibly handy widgets"

These are the little gadgets and homemade testers that are useful for many
repair situations. Here are just a few of the most basic:

   o Series light bulb for current limiting during the testing of TVs,
     monitors, switching power supplies, audio power amplifiers, etc. I built
     a dual outlet box with the outlets wired in series so that a lamp can be
     plugged into one outlet and the device under test into the other. For
     added versatility, add a regular outlet and 'kill' switch using a quad
     box instead. The use of a series load will prevent your expensive
     replacement part like a switchmode power transistor from blowing if
     there is still some fault in the circuit you have failed to locate.
     (Now, if I would only remember to do this more often!). See the section:
     @{"The series light bulb trick" link "4.9"}

   o A Variac. It doesn't need to be large - a 2 A Variac mounted with a
     switch, outlet and fuse will suffice for most tasks. However, a 5 amp or
     larger Variac won't hurt. If you will be troubleshooting 220 VAC
     equipment in the US, there are Variacs that will output 0-240 VAC from a
     115 VAC line (just make sure you don't forget that this can easily fry
     your 115 VAC equipment.) By varying the line voltage, not only can you
     bring up a newly repaired monitor gradually to make sure there are no
     problems; you can also evaluate behavior at low and high line voltage.
     This can greatly aid in troubleshooting power supply problems. WARNING:
     a Variac is an autotransformer - not an isolation transformer and does
     not help with respect to safety. You need an isolation transformer as
     well.

   o Isolation transformer. This is very important for safely working on live
     chassis equipment like line connected switchmode power supplies (primary
     side). You can build one from a pair of similar power transformers
     back-to-back (with their highest rated secondaries connected together. I
     built mine from a couple of similar old tube type TV power transformers
     mounted on a board with an outlet box including a fuse. Their secondary
     high voltage windings were connected together to couple the two
     transformers together. The unused low voltage windings can be put in
     series with the primary or output windings to adjust voltage.
     Alternatively, commercial line isolation transformers suitable for TV
     troubleshooting are available for less than $100 - well worth every
     penny.

     There is absolutely no imaginable reason not to use an isolation
     transformer for troubleshooting SMPSs except possibly for the final test
     where confirmation is needed that the inrush from a direct line
     connection (which will have virtually unlimited instantaneous current
     capability) will not damage the newly repaired supply.

   o Variable isolation transformer. You don't need to buy a fancy
     combination unit. A Variac can be followed by a normal isolation
     transformer. (The opposite order also works. There may be some subtle
     differences in load capacity.).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.6 "Safe discharging of capacitors in switchmode power supplies"

A working SMPS may discharge its capacitors fairly quickly when it is shut
off but DO NOT count on this. The main filter capacitors may have bleeder
resistors to drain their charge relatively quickly - but resistors can fail
and the term 'quickly' may be relative to the age of the universe. Don't
depend on them.

The technique I recommend is to use a high wattage resistor of about 5 to 50
ohms/V of the working voltage of the capacitor. This will prevent the
arc-welding associated with screwdriver discharge but will have a short
enough time constant so that the capacitor will drop to a low voltage in at
most a few seconds (dependent of course on the RC time constant and its
original voltage).

Then check with a voltmeter to be double sure. Better yet, monitor while
discharging.

Obviously, make sure that you are well insulated!

For the power supply filter capacitors which might be 400 uF at 200 V, a 2 K
ohm 10 W resistor would be suitable. RC=.8 second. 5RC=4 seconds. A lower
wattage resistor (compared to that calculated from V^^2 / R) can be used
since the total energy stored in the capacitor is not that great (but still
potentially lethal).

The discharge tool and circuit described in the next two sections can be used
to provide a visual indication of polarity and charge for TV, monitor, SMPS,
power supply filter capacitors and small electronic flash energy storage
capacitors, and microwave oven high voltage capacitors.

Reasons to use a resistor and not a screwdriver to discharge capacitors:

   o It will not destroy screwdrivers and capacitor terminals.

   o It will not damage the capacitor (due to the current pulse).

   o It will reduce your spouse's stress level in not having to hear those
     scary snaps and crackles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.7 "Capacitor discharge tool"

A suitable discharge tool for each of these applications can be made as quite
easily. The capacitor discharge indicator circuit described below can be
built into this tool to provide a visual display of polarity and charge (not
really needed for CRTs as the discharge time constant is virtually
instantaneous even with a multi-M ohm resistor.

   o Solder one end of the appropriate size resistor (for your application)
     along with the indicator circuit (if desired) to a well insulated clip
     lead about 2-3 feet long. For safety reasons, these connections must be
     properly soldered - not just wrapped.

   o Solder the other end of the resistor (and discharge circuit) to a well
     insulated contact point such as a 2 inch length of bare #14 copper wire
     mounted on the end of a 2 foot piece of PVC or Plexiglas rod which will
     act as an extension handle.

   o Secure everything to the insulating rod with some plastic electrical
     tape.

This discharge tool will keep you safely clear of the danger area.

Again, always double check with a reliable voltmeter or by shorting with an
insulated screwdriver!

@node 4.8 "Capacitor discharge indicator circuit"

Here is a suggested circuit which will discharge the main filter capacitors
in switchmode power supplies, TVs, and monitors. This circuit can be built
into the discharge tool described above.

A visual indication of charge and polarity is provided from maximum input
down to a few volts.

The total discharge time is approximately 1 second per 100 uF of capacitance
(5RC with R = 2 K ohms).

Safe capability of this circuit with values shown is about 500 V and 1000 uF
maximum. Adjust the component values for your particular application.

The two sets of 4 diodes will maintain a nearly constant voltage drop of
about 2.8-3 V across the LED+resistor as long as the input is greater than
around 20 V. NOTE: this means that the brightness of the LED is NOT an

about 20 volts. The brightness will then decrease until it cuts off totally
at around 3 volts.

Safety note: always confirm discharge with a voltmeter before touching any
high voltage capacitors!

@node 4.9 "The series light bulb trick"

When powering up a monitor (or any other modern electronic devices with
expensive power semiconductors) that has had work done on any power circuits,
it is desirable to minimize the chance of blowing your newly installed parts
should there still be a fault. There are two ways of doing this: use of a
Variac to bring up the AC line voltage gradually and the use of a series load
to limit current to power semiconductors.

Actually using a series load - a light bulb is just a readily available cheap
load - is better than a Variac (well both might be better still) since it
will limit current to (hopefully) non-destructive levels.

What you want to do is limit current to the critical parts - usually the
switchmode (chopper) power transistor of an SMPS or horizontal output
transistor (HOT) of a TV or monitor. Most of the time you will get away with
putting it in series with the AC line. However, sometimes, putting a light
bulb directly in the B+ circuit will provide better protection as it will
limit the current out of the main filter capacitors. Actually, an actual
power resistor is probably better as its resistance is constant as opposed to
a light bulb which will vary by 1:10 from cold to hot. The light bulb,
however, provides a nice visual indication of the current drawn by the
circuit under test. Specifically:

   o Full brightness: short circuit or extremely heavy load - a major fault
     probably is still present.

   o Initially bright but then settles at reduced brightness: filter
     capacitors charge, then lower current to rest of circuit. This is what
     is expected when the equipment is operating normally. There could still
     be a problem with the power circuits but it will probably not result in
     an immediate catastrophic failure.

   o Pulsating: power supply is trying to come up but shutting down due to
     overcurrent or overvoltage condition. This could be due to a continuing
     fault or the light bulb may be too small for the equipment.

NOTE: for a TV or monitor, it may be desirable to disconnect the degauss coil
as this represents a heavy initial load which may prevent the unit from
starting up with the light bulb in the circuit.

The following are suggested starting wattages:

   o 40 W bulb for VCR or laptop computer switching power supplies.
   o 100 W bulb for small (i.e., B/W or 13 inch color) monitors or TVs.
   o 150-200 W bulb for large color monitors or projection TVs.

Depending on the power rating of the equipment, these wattages may need to be
increased. However, start low. If the bulb lights at full brightness, you
know there is still a major fault. If it flickers or the TV (or other device)
does not quite come fully up, then it should be safe to go to a larger bulb.
Resist the temptation to immediately remove the bulb at this point - I have
been screwed by doing this. Try a larger one first. The behavior should
improve. If it does not, there is still a fault present.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.10 "What about SMPSs in TVs and monitors?"

TVs and monitors have at least one SMPS - the horizontal deflection flyback
circuit and may have an additional SMPS to provide the low voltages or the DC
for the horizontal output transistor. Most of the theory of operation and
troubleshooting techniques apply to these as well. However, manufacturers of
TVs and monitors tend to be really creative (can you say, obscure?) when it
comes to these designs so a little more head scratching is often necessary to
decipher the circuit and get into the mind of the designer. However, the
basic failure modes are similar and the same test procedures may be used.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.11 "SMPS failure modes"

SMPS fail in many ways but the following are common:

   o Shorted switchmode transistor - may take out additional parts such as
     fusable flameproof resistors in collector or emitter circuits (or source
     or drain circuits for MOSFETs). Main fuse will blow unless protected by
     fusable resistors.

     Symptoms: totally dead supply, fuse blows instantly (vaporizes or
     explodes unless fusable resistor has opened). Measuring across C-E or
     D-S of switchmode transistor yields near zero ohms even when removed
     from circuit.

   o Shorted rectifier diodes in secondary circuits - these are high
     frequency high efficiency diodes under a fair amount of stress.

     Symptoms: In a very basic supply without overcurrent protection, the
     failure of one or more of these diodes may then overload the supply and
     cause a catastrophic failure of the switchmode power transistor (see
     above) and related components. Thus, these should be checked before
     reapplying power to a supply that had a shorted switchmode transistor.

     On short circuit protected supplies, the symptom may be a periodic
     tweet-tweet-tweet or flub-flub-flub as the supply attempts to restart
     and then shuts down. Any power or indicator lights may be blinking at
     this rate as well.

     Test with an ohmmeter - a low reading in both directions indicates a bad
     diode. Sometimes these will test ok but fail under load or at operating
     voltage. Easiest to replace with known good diodes to verify diagnosis.
     Rectifiers either look like 1N400X type on steroids - cylinders about
     1/4" x 1/2" (example: HFR854) or TO220 packages (example: C92M) with
     dual diodes connected at the cathode for positive supplies or the anode
     for negative supplies (the package may include a little diagram as
     well). These may either be used with a center-tapped transformer, or
     simply parallel for high current capacity. If in doubt, remove from the
     circuit and test with the ohmmeter again. If not the output used for
     regulation feedback, try the supply with the rectifier removed. As
     noted, a test with an ohmmeter may be misleading as these rectifiers can
     fail at full voltage. When in doubt, substitute a known good rectifier
     (one half of a pair will be good enough for a test).

   o Bad startup circuit - initial base (gate) drive is often provided by a
     high value, high power resistor or resistors from the rectified AC
     voltage. These can simply open for no good reason.

     Symptoms: In this case the supply will appear totally dead but all the
     semiconductors will check out and no fuses will blow. Check the startup
     resistors with an ohmmeter - power resistors in the AC line input
     section. WARNING: there will be full voltage on the main filter
     capacitor(s) - 1x or 2x peak or around 150 or 300 VDC depending on
     design. Discharge before probing.

   o Dried up capacitors - either input or output side.

     Symptoms: The main filter capacitor may dry up or open and cause the
     output to be pulsing at 60 (50) or 120 (100) Hz and all kinds of
     regulation problems. Measure voltage across main filter capacitor(s). If
     the reading is low and drops to a much lower value or 0 instantly upon
     pulling the plug, then one of these capacitors may be open or dried up.
     If you have an oscilloscope, monitor for ripple (use an isolation
     transformer!!). Excess ripple under moderate load is an indication of a
     dried up or open capacitor.

     Capacitors in the low voltage section may fail causing regulation
     problems. Sometimes there are slew rate limiting capacitors which feed
     from the primary output to the regulator controller to limit initial
     in-rush and overshoot. A failure of one of these may mess up regulation
     at the very least. For example, excess leakage may reduce the output of
     the main output (and as a consequence, all the others as well).

     In almost all cases, when in doubt parallel a known good capacitor of
     similar capacitance and at least equal voltage rating (except for these
     slew rate limiting capacitors where substitution is the only sure test).

     For Panasonic (and other) VCR power supplies, it has been suggested that
     one or more the output filter capacitors commonly fail and replacing all
     of them, while perhaps a brute force solution, will fix a whining supply
     or one having bad regulation or noise. However, check the semiconductors
     as well before applying power.

   o Bad connection/cold solder joints - as with all other mass produced
     power systems (including TVs and monitors), cracked or defective solder
     connections are very common especially around the pins of high power
     components like transformers, power resistors and transistors, and
     connectors.

     Symptoms: almost any kind of intermittent behavior is possible. Visually
     inspect with a bright light and magnifying glass if necessary. Gently
     prod or twist the circuit board with an insulating stick to see if the
     problem can be made to change. Note that a one time intermittent can
     blow many components so inspecting for intermittents is a really good
     idea even you believe that all bad components have been replaced.

   o Regulation problems - outputs high or low.

     Symptoms: voltage has changed and adjustment pot if one exists has no
     effect or is unable to set voltage to proper value. Check components in
     the feedback regulator, particularly the opto-isolator and its
     associated circuitry. A weak opto-isolator may allow for excessive
     output voltage. A shorted photodiode in the opto-isolator may prevent
     startup. An open photodiode may lead to a runaway condition. WARNING:
     probe these circuits with care both because of the safety issues but
     also since any slip of the probe may lead to a runaway condition and
     catastrophic failure of the switchmode transistor and its related parts
     as well as damage to any attached equipment.

Note that the high frequency transformer does not make the top 10 list -
failure rates for these components are relatively low. You better hope so in
any case - replacements are usually only available from the original
manufacturer at outrageous cost.

All other parts are readily available from places like MCM Electronics,
Dalbani, Premium Parts, and other national distributors.

Also, while it is tempting to suspect any ICs or hybrid controllers since it
is thought that replacements are difficult and expensive to obtain, these
parts are pretty robust unless a catastrophic failure elsewhere sent current
where it should not have gone.

@endnode
@node 4.12 "General SMPS troubleshooting approach"

The following sections provide a set of guidelines for attacking SMPS
problems. Those in the next 5 paragraphs are common to SMPS using both
discrete and integrated controllers:

  1. First, determine that it is not something trivial like a blown fuse due
     to a legitimate overload (that has since been removed). I have a SCSI
     peripheral box that will blow its SMPS fuse if the SCSI cable is
     inserted live.

  2. Categorize the problem into: startup problem, catastrophic failure,
     incorrect outputs, or excessive ripple or noise.

  3. Determine what the proper output voltages should be. Identify the main
     (regulated) output.

  4. Disconnect the supply from the equipment it is powering if possible.
     This will prevent the possibility of expensive damage should the output
     voltages soar to stratospheric levels for some reason. If this is not
     possible, you will need to be extra careful - always use a Variac to
     bring up the input slowly and monitor the main output at all times.

  5. Determine an appropriate load for the outputs (if not connected to the
     equipment). A typical SMPS will want a minimum of 5% to 20% of full load
     current at least on the main output to regulate properly. Others may not
     need any load - it depends on the design or they may have an internal
     load. Here are some typical load currents:

      o VCR - .2 A on +5 V and +12 V outputs.
      o PC - 2 A on +5, 1 A on +12. A dual beam auto head light works well.
      o Monitor - .2 A on +60 to +120 V output.
      o Typical 40 W switcher = 1 A on +5 and +12.

@node 4.13 "Troubleshooting SMPSs using discrete controllers"

The following paragraphs apply mainly to SMPSs using discrete circuitry (no
ICs) for pulse width control. For those using integrated controller chips,
see the next section: @{"Troubleshooting SMPSs using integrated controllers" link "4.14"}

   o Startup problems - check the power on the switchmode transistor and work
     back from there if there is none. Check for open fusable resistors in
     the return as well. Determine if there is startup base/gate drive. Check
     for open startup resistors, bad connections, blown parts in the
     controller circuitry.

   o Blows fuses - check switchmode transistor and all other semiconductors
     for shorted junctions. Then check for open fusable resistors and bad
     connections.

   o Power cycling - monitor current and voltage sensing signals to determine
     if they are actually signaling a fault. Open or out of tolerance
     resistors may result in incorrect sensing. With the series light bulb
     and/or Variac, disable each of these inputs by bypassing the appropriate
     components. If one of these experiments prevents the cycling behavior,
     either that circuit has a faulty component or the controller circuit is
     not functioning properly.

   o Regulation or ripple/noise problems - check main HV filter capacitor and
     other filter capacitors for decreased value or opens. Check regulation
     components including shunt regulators and zener diodes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.14 "Troubleshooting SMPSs using integrated controllers"

Since there are usually several fault conditions that can result in an
aborted startup or cycling behavior, the basic troubleshooting procedure
needs to be modified when dealing with SMPS using controller ICs like the
UC3840 or UC3842.

Also see the section:
@{"Typical controller ICs found in small switchmode power supplies" link "6.1"}
for descriptions of two common integrated controller ICs.

The following paragraphs apply to SMPSs using integrated controllers. For
those using discrete components only (no ICs), see the previous section:
@{"Troubleshooting SMPSs using discrete controllers" link "4.13"}

   o Startup problems - check the power on the switchmode transistor and work
     back from there if there is none. Check for open fusable resistors in
     the return as well. Check for power to the controller. Determine that no
     fault condition inputs have abnormal voltages during startup. Check for
     drive out of the controller IC and see if it reaches the switchmode
     transistor. You will probably need to power cycle the line input -
     preferably with a Variac - and monitor each of the relevant signals as
     you do so. Determine if the supply is shutting down abnormally due to a
     legitimate or bogus over-current or over-voltage condition or is never
     actually starting up due to a lack of a voltage or a stuck-at fault on a
     sense line.

   o Blows fuses - check switchmode transistor and all other semiconductors
     for shorted junctions. Then check for open fusable resistors and bad
     connections. There is a chance that a blown transistor took out the
     controller chip as well. Under normal conditions, controllers like the
     UC3840 or UC3842 should current limit on a PWM cycle-by-cycle basis.
     Therefore, a blown fuse indicates a failure of either the switchmode
     transistor, controller or both.

   o Power cycling - monitor current and voltage sensing and Vcc inputs to
     controller to determine which, if any, are at fault. Open or out of
     tolerance resistors may result in incorrect sensing. Check for faulty
     reference setting components like zener diodes. With the series light
     bulb and/or Variac, disable each of the sense inputs by bypassing the
     appropriate components. If one of these experiments prevents the cycling
     behavior, either that circuit has a faulty component or the controller
     IC's input characteristics have changed and it will need to be replaced.
     It should be possible to determine if these sensing reference levels are
     correct from the controller specifications and thus should be ignored by
     the controller as within normal limits.

   o Regulation or ripple/noise problems - check main HV filter capacitor and
     other filter capacitors for decreased value or opens. Check regulation
     feedback components to controller including any reference voltage output
     and zener diodes. Determine if the controller is responding to error
     voltage. If possible, monitor both error and PWM drive signals on a dual
     trace scope.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.15 "Initial post-repair testing"

Once defective parts have been replaced, if possible remove the normal load
from the supply if you have not already done so just in case it decides to
put excessive voltage on its outputs and replace with a dummy load. For a
multiple output supply, the most important output to have a load on is the
one that is used for regulation but some modest load on all the outputs is
preferred. You should be able to determine a suitable value by considering
the application. For something like a VCR, a few hundred mA on the main
output is probably enough. This would require something like a 25 ohm 2 W
resistor for a 5 or 6 volt output or 50 ohm 5 W resistor for a 12 volt output
(depending on which is the primary output). For a PC power supply, a couple
of amps may be needed - a 2 or 3 ohm 15 W resistor on the +5 output. The
minimum load is sometimes indicated on the specification sticker. In the case
of a TV or monitor, disconnecting the load may not be possible (or at least,
easy).

If available, use a Variac to bring up the input voltage slowly while
observing the main output. You should see something at about 50% of normal
input voltage - 50 or 60 V for a normal 115 VAC supply. With a small load,
the output should very quickly reach or even exceed its normal value.
Regulation at very low line voltage may be far off - this is often normal. If
you do not have a Variac, put a light bulb in series with the line (this is
desirable in any case). Use a 100 W bulb for a TV or PC, 40 W for a VCR
typical. The light bulb should limit the current to a non-destructive value
long enough to determine whether everything is ok. It may not permit normal
operation under full load, however. When power is first applied, the light
bulb will flash briefly but may just barely be glowing once the output has
stabilized. If it is fairly bright continuously, there is likely still a
problem in the supply. See the section: @{"The series light bulb trick" link "4.9"}

Once you are finished, save your schematic and notes for the future. For
example, multiple models of VCRs even from different manufacturers use the
same basic design, maybe even the same supply.

@endnode
@node 4.16 "Some general switchmode power supply repair comments"

Any time the switchmode transistor requires replacement, check all
semiconductors for shorts and fusable resistors for opens. even if you locate
THE problem early on. Multiple parts often fail and just replacing the
transistor may cause it to fail as a result of something else still being
bad.  It only takes a few more minutes. However, for other problems like an
open startup resistor or dried up capacitor, this excessive caution is
unnecessary as these are usually isolated failures.

It is often helpful to trace the circuit by hand if a service manual is not
available. You will gain a better understanding of this supply and be able to
put the knowledge to use when the next one shows up on your bench - there is
a lot of similarity even between different manufacturers. The only difficult
part will be determining how the transformer windings are hooked up. An
ohmmeter will help but even if you cannot entirely determine this, just make
a note. For most purposes, the exact topology of the windings is not critical
for diagnostic procedures.

@node 5.1 "Common, unusual, and strange"

Most of the components used in switchmode power supplies are common and
easily identified. However, some may be unfamiliar and unrecognizable. Others
could be totally custom parts - ASICs or hybrid circuits - developed
specifically for a particular model or product line. However, these rarely
fail despite your temptation to blame them specifically *because* locating a
replacement is difficult and most likely expensive.

Common components like transistors, diodes, capacitors, and resistors, can
usually be tested with a multimeter at least for total failure. Also see the
documents: "Testing Bipolar Transistors with a DMM or VOM" and "Testing
Capacitors with a Multimeter and Safe Discharging".

Of course, with catastrophic failures, no equipment beyond your eyeballs and
nose may be needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.2 "Switchmode (chopper) transistors and other semiconductors"

   o Bipolar power transistors (often BU or 2SC/2SD numbers) - high voltage
     power types are used for the main switchmode (chopper) transistor.

     Test for shorted and open junctions. These are the most common failures
     for the power transistors. Partial failure where there is some leakage
     or various parameters change value are unlikely.

     Substitution of a transistor with at least equal voltage and current
     ratings should be fine for testing as long as you use a series light
     bulb to limit the current should something still be wrong elsewhere in
     the circuit. A not-exact match may run hotter than normal. Always use a
     heatsink.

   o Power MOSFETs (2SK numbers) - many newer supplies are using these rather
     than the bipolar type. In some ways they are more robust but testing is
     more difficult.

     Testing for shorts is still possible but anything more requires
     additional equipment beyond a multimeter. However, the original problem
     did not blow a fuse or fusable resistor, if the MOSFET is not shorted,
     there is an good chance that it is still fine and you should look
     elsewhere for the problem. It may be a problem with the startup circuit
     or controller.

     NOTE: if your supply produces any output (say, more than 10% of rated
     voltage), it is unlikely that the chopper transistor is bad as it must
     be working to some extent and, as noted, these usually blow totally.

   o Small bipolar transistors - these may be found in feedback and control
     functions.

     Test for shorted and open junctions with a multimeter. Substitute with
     similar known good transistor is best, however. I have seen little
     silicon transistors that had developed enough leakage to prevent a 400 W
     supply from coming up!

   o Diodes and rectifiers - a bridge or set of 2 or 4 discrete diodes is
     usually used for the AC line rectification and/or doubling. High
     efficiency and/or fast recovery types are used in the secondary side for
     rectification of the various output voltages. These may look like normal
     axial lead diodes or may be combined in pairs inside TO220 type
     packages.

     Test for shorted and open junctions. However, sometimes, diodes will
     only fail with full voltage in-circuit but test good with a multimeter.

     Replacements for the primary side rectifiers are very inexpensive and
     readily available. If the unit blows fuses with the switchmode
     transistor and main filter capacitors pulled, the rectifiers may indeed
     be bad.

     It is usually safe to remove secondary rectifiers one at a time to see
     if the supply will come up. As long as you do not remove all diodes for
     the output that provides the feedback for the regulation, this should be
     relatively low risk. (However, do this with a dummy load - not your
     expensive laptop computer just in case.) Even removing those diodes is
     usually safe if you can power the supply using a Variac since you will
     be able to limit the input (while monitoring the main output) should the
     outputs go overvoltage.

   o SCRs - small SCRs may be found in the overvoltage protection circuitry
     of some supplies. Note that SCR type of crowbars are used across the
     output as a way to guarantee that an overvoltage condition will kill the
     output regardless of the reason for the overvoltage condition.
     Hopefully, the supply's overcurrent protection will kick in rather than
     having the supply blow up. This is not always the case, unfortunately.

     Test for shorts if output on which SCR is connected is not coming up.
     Remove the SCR. Now, using a Variac to bring up the voltage slowly, see
     if the relevant output is going over voltage, is still clamped at a low
     level, or is the correct voltage (under load). A momentary overvoltage
     spike at turn-on could also trip the crowbar. This could be due to a
     faulty inrush/slew rate limiting circuit.

   o TL431 or similar shunt regulator IC - either a TO92 or 8 pin DIP. Has 3
     active terminals - A, C, and R. Current will flow from C to A if R-A is
     greater than 2.5 V.

     Test for shorts but substitution is best. However, with care (using a
     Variac AND series light bulb to limit the input current, it is possible
     to determine if the circuit in which these are connected is working.
     Short across TL431 - supply should either turn off or run at greatly
     reduced output. Remove the TL431 - there should be no regulation -
     outputs should continue to climb as Variac is increased. By monitoring
     input to TL431 it should be possible to determine if it is doing its
     job.

   o Optoisolator - either a 4 or 6 pin DIP or a 4 pin cylindrical object.
     This provides the regulator feedback across the isolation barrier.
     Replacements are readily available.

     Test by putting 10-20 mA through LED and measuring decrease in
     resistance of reverse biased photodiode. However, this will not identify
     a weak optoisolator. Swapping is best.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.3 "Capacitors (filter and bypass)"

   o Filter capacitors - electrolytic type are used for filtering of the
     rectified (possibly doubled) AC line input and for filtering of the
     various outputs of the power supply.

     If no capacitor checker is available, test for opens, shorts, and
     leakage with a multimeter. For electrolytics, this is straightforward.
     Inspect the capacitor for any discoloration, a bulging case, or other
     evidence of trauma.

     Better yet - substitute a known good capacitor of at least equal working
     voltage and similar uF rating.

   o Bypass Capacitors - high quality plastic dipped or rectangular molded
     capacitors as part of RFI filter. Rarely fail.

     Test for shorts - your multimeter will probably not be able to detect
     the small capacitance. Substitute if in doubt.

     Note that many of these are special high quality low loss types with
     regulatory approval for use across the power line in the line filter.
     Exact replacements are required for safety.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.4 "Resistors (normal and flameproof), NTC thermistors, MOVs"

   o Resistors - test for correct value with a multimeter. If measured
     in-circuit, value may read low if shunted by other components. If a
     higher than normal reading is obtained in-circuit, the resistor is bad.
     Metal film types like to go open circuit - especially very high value
     resistors.

     Startup resistors in particular tend to go open-circuit resulting in a
     dead supply but no blown fuses or fusable resistors. These are usually
     high value (100K typical) medium wattage and run hot since they are
     across the full rectified line voltage.

   o Flameproof or fusable resistors (They are the same) - these are often
     designated 'FR'. They will look like power resistors but will be colored
     blue or gray, or may be rectangular ceramic blocks. They should only be
     replaced with flameproof resistors with identical ratings. They serve a
     very important safety function: they cannot catch fire when overheated
     and will open rather than changing value which implements an overload
     protection function.

     These usually serve as fuses in addition to any other fuses that may be
     present (and in addition to their function as a resistor, though this
     isn't always needed). If an FR type resistor has blown, you probably
     have shorted semiconductors that will need to be replaced as well. Check
     all the transistors and diodes in the power supply with an ohmmeter. You
     may find that the main switch mode transistor has decided to turn into a
     blob of solder - dead short. Check everything out even if you find one
     bad part - many components can fail or cause other components to fail if
     you don't locate them all. Check resistors as well, even if they look
     ok.

     The most common location for these in a small SMPS is in the return
     circuit of a the switchmode transistor. However, they may be in the
     power feed as well. The value may be a fraction of an ohm but can be
     larger.

     In TVs and monitors, these are often found in the hot power feed to the
     main low voltage power supply and in various secondary supply feeds as
     well. For the main supply, they will be 5-25 W rectangular ceramic power
     resistors. For the secondary supplies, they may be the 1/2-2 W blue or
     brown tubular variety.

     Test for opens. Those in the return circuits are usually very low value
     - a fraction of an ohm to a few ohms - if in the return of the
     switchmode (chopper) transistor. The type in the power feeds may be
     anywhere from a fraction of an ohm to several K ohms depending on the
     circuit load.

     For testing ONLY, a normal resistor may be substituted but the proper
     replacement MUST be installed before returning the supply to service.

   o MOVs - Metal Oxide Varistors - look like brightly colored plastic coated
     disk capacitors but not marked with capacitance. These are surge
     suppressors. A severe surge or lightning strike may obliterate one or
     more of these. There will usually be either 1 between the Hot and
     Neutral or 3 across H, N, and safety ground.

     If they are visibly damaged in any way, just remove (for now) or
     replace. Test with an ohmmeter - resistance should be nearly infinite.

   o NTC resistors (thermistors) - Negative Temperature Coefficient resistors
     act as inrush surge limiters. There may be one or two of these in series
     with the AC input. These are a high value when cold but drop to a low
     value once they heat up due to current flow into the supply. These often
     look like fat black disk capacitors.

     Test when cold and hot (use a hot air gun or hair dryer if not
     in-circuit). Resistance should drop from 10s of ohms to a very low
     value.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.5 "Transformers and inductors"

   o High frequency transformers - these include the switchmode power
     transformer and any feedback (toroidal or E-I core type) transformers.

     The main transformer which provides line isolation and generates the
     multiple output voltages from the 150-320 VDC input rail. These are
     usually custom wound for each model power supply and replacements are
     only available from the manufacturer. However, some distributors will
     stock replacements for a few TVs and computer monitors.

     Testing for opens is usually easy since connections to the input
     (chopper) and output rectifiers are fairly obvious. However, feedback
     windings may be involved and these are not readily determined without a
     schematic or tracing the circuit (and, possibly not even then.) The good
     news is that failures of these transformers is less common than one
     might fear.

     Some supplies use small transformers for feedback rather than
     optoisolators. These can be tested for opens but rarely cause problems.

     Identifying shorted turns requires a 'ring test' or measurement of the
     Q. See the document: "Testing of Flyback (LOPT) Transformers".

   o Inductors - test for opens. Identifying shorted turns requires a 'ring
     test' or measurement of the Q. See the document: "Testing of Flyback
     (LOPT) Transformers".

     AC line input inductors can just be bypassed if they test open.

     Output 'pi' filter inductors rarely fail but if you suspect one, just
     remove it and jumper across the pads for testing - ripple just won't be
     quite as good.

   o Coupled Inductors - used as part of the Pi type RFI filter in the AC
     input circuit. These look like small transformers but the windings are
     in series with the AC line. There are usually 1 or 2 of these on better
     supplies and they are very reliable.

     Test for opens. Identifying shorted turns requires a 'ring test' or
     measurement of the Q. See the document: "Testing of Flyback (LOPT)
     Transformers".

     These inductors can just be removed and bypassed during testing if they
     are open since they only affect input line noise filtering.

@node 6.1 "Typical controller ICs found in small switchmode power supplies"

Here is some information on the Unitrode UC3840 programmable off-line PWM
controller and its simplified cousin, the UC3842. These are typical of the
types of sophisticated inexpensive integrated SMPS controller ICs that are
now readily available.

These device generates the PWM pulse control to the switchmode (chopper)
transistor as well as various fault sensing and other control functions.

Parts such as these are now found in many small switchmode power supplies and
provide much more precise control during startup and normal operation, and
better handling of fault conditions compared to most implementations using
discrete circuitry.

However, they also result in additional head scratching when troubleshooting
since many faults or incorrectly detected faults can shut down the unit or
cause a power cycling type of behavior. Therefore, a datasheet for the
controller chip will prove essential. In many cases a scope will be needed to
monitor the various sense, control, and drive signals. A systematic
troubleshooting approach must be used to eliminate power, startup, sensing,
and control components one at a time once obvious shorted or open parts or
bad connections have been eliminated from consideration.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.2 "Unitrode UC3840 programmable off-line PWM controller"

Features of the Unitrode UC3840 include:

  1. Fixed frequency operation set by user selected components.

  2. A variable slope ramp generator for constant volt-second operation.
     providing open-loop line regulation and minimizing or in some cases,
     even eliminating the need for feedback control.

  3. A drive switch for low current start-up off of the high voltage line.

  4. A precision reference generator with internal over-voltage protection.

  5. Complete over-voltage, under-voltage, and over-current protection
     including programmable shutdown and restart.

  6. A high current single-ended PWM output optimized for fast turn-off of an
     external power switch.

The following pin descriptions for the Unitrode UC3840 were derived from a
Unitrode application note. Errors in interpretation are quite possible.

Pin 1: Compensation
     Error amplifier (op amp) compensation network.

Pin 2: Start/U.V. lockout
     This comparator performs three functions. With an increasing voltage, it
     generates a turn-on signal at a start threshold. With a decreasing
     voltage, it generates an under-voltage fault signal at a lower level
     separated by a 200uA hysteresis current. At the under-voltage threshold,
     it also resets the Error Latch if the Reset Latch has been set.

Pin 3: OV sense
     Over-voltage input from power supply output(s).

Pin 4: Stop (Ext stop)
     External logic signal to inhibit power.

Pin 5: Reset
     External logic signal to reset error condition caused by (1)
     over-voltage, (2) over-current, (3) input under-voltage detect, (4)
     external stop.

Pin 6: Current threshold
     This voltage input sets the over-current trigger levels for the internal
     comparators.

Pin 7: Current sense
     This is the pulse-by-pulse PWM current control. The input is a voltage
     taken across a series resistor in the switchmode transistor's return.

     There are two internal comparators with a difference in threshold of 400
     mV. The one with the lower threshold limits the current for each PWM
     cycle. The one with the higher threshold sets the error flop-flop and
     shuts down the supply if its threshold is ever exceeded.

Pin 8: Slow start
     This input limits the maximum PWM duty cycle. During power-on, an RC
     delay can therefore control the rate at which the output ramps up. The
     final value limits the maximum PWM duty cycle during normal operation.

Pin 9: Rt/Ct
     R and C determine the constant PWM oscillator frequency.

Pin 10: Ramp
     Ramp generator output.

Pin 11: Vi sense
     This voltage is normally derived from the DC input and controls the
     slope of the ramp.

Pin 12: PWM output
     This is the drive signal to the switchmode transistor. This is an open
     collector output and will normally be used in conjunction with the
     Driver bias (Pin 14) signal to provide total drive to the switchmode
     transistor.

Pin 13: Ground
     Signal and drive common.

Pin 14: Driver bias
     Supplies drive current to external power switch to provide turn-on bias
     and pullup during normal operation. Disabled for shutdown if the Error
     Latch is set.

Pin 15: Vcc
     UC3840 chip supply derived from the DC input rail during startup and
     secondary winding on high frequency transformer during normal operation.

Pin 16: 5V reference
     Stable voltage reference (output) for regulation control.

Pin 17: Inv input
     Error amplifier inverting input.

Pin 18: Non inv input
     Error amplifier non-inverting input.

The difference between the inputs on Pins 17 and 18 control PWM duty cycle.
These will generally be derived by comparing the main output with the desired
voltage reference.

@endnode
@node 6.3 "Unitrode UC3842 off-line PWM controller"

The UC3842 provides the necessary functions to implement an off-line fixed
frequency current mode control schemes with a minimal external parts count.
Note how most of the pin functions are subsets of those found in the more
sophisticated UC3840. The UC3842 retains most of the features of the UC3840
but requires fewer external components and comes in a much smaller package (8
vs. 18 pins).

The following pin descriptions for the Unitrode UC3842 were derived from a
Unitrode application note. Errors in interpretation are quite possible.

Pin 1: Compensation
     Error amplifier (op amp) compensation network.

Pin 2: Vfb
     Error amplifier (non-inverting) input for regulation feedback.

     This input is used to control PWM duty cycle and is normally derived
     from the main regulated output voltage. It is similar in function to the
     non-inverting input, Pin 18, of the UC3840.

Pin 3: Current sense
     This is the pulse-by-pulse PWM current control. The input is a voltage
     taken across a series resistor in the switchmode transistor's return.

Pin 4: Rt/Ct
     R and C determine the constant PWM oscillator frequency.

Pin 5: Ground
     Signal and drive common.

Pin 6: PWM output
     This is the drive signal to the switchmode transistor. It uses a totem
     pole output which has a high current drive capability both high and low.

Pin 7: Vcc
     UC3842 chip supply derived from the DC input rail during startup and
     secondary winding on high frequency transformer during normal operation.

Pin 8: 5 V reference
     Stable voltage reference (output) for regulation control.

@node 6.4 "Changing the input voltage of a switchmode power supply"

Would it be possible to modify a power supply designed for operation on 120
VAC for use overseas where the power is 240 VAC?

I don't advise it. There are many factors involved in changing a power supply
unless it is designed for dual voltage or autoswitching. They saved a few
cents if it is not easily switched, what can I say?

The problem is that it is probably a flyback convertor and these are pretty
finicky about changes. In addition to the caps, and switching transistor, the
transformer would probably saturate at the higher voltage unless the
switching frequency were also doubled. Getting these things to work normally
without blowing up is touchy enough. To change one without a thorough
understanding of all the design parameters would be really risky.

Going the other way may be more realistic if (and this is a big if) you will
not be running at anywhere near full capacity. Many switchmode power supplies
will run on much lower than their rated input voltage. However, regulation
may be poor and the switchmode transistor will need to be passing much higher
current to maintain the same power output. To maintain specifications could
require extensive changes to the circuitry and replacement of the switchmode
transistor and possibly transformer and other parts as well. Again, I do not
recommend this.

Use a small stepup or stepdown transformer instead. The only exception is if
there are clearly marked jumpers to select the input voltage or the supply is
clearly marked as being autoswitching or having universal power input.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.5 "Use of surge suppressors and line filters"

Should you always use a surge suppressor outlet strip or line circuit? Sure,
it shouldn't hurt. Just don't depend on these to provide protection under all
circumstances. Some are better than others and the marketing blurb is at best
of little help in making an informed selection. Product literature - unless
it is backed up by testing from a reputable lab - is usually pretty useless
and often confusing.

Line filters can also be useful if power in you area is noisy or prone to
spikes or dips.

However, keep in mind that most well designed electronic equipment already
includes both surge suppressors like MOVs as well as L-C line filters. More
is not necessarily better but may move the point of failure to a readily
accessible outlet strip rather than the innards of your equipment if damage
occurs.

Very effective protection is possible through the use of a UPS
(Uninterruptible Power Supply) which always runs the equipment off its
battery from the internal invertor (not all do). This provides very effective
isolation power line problems as the battery acts as a huge capacitor. If
something is damaged, it will likely be the UPS and not your expensive
equipment. Another option is to use a constant voltage transformer (SOLA)
which provides voltage regulation, line conditioning, and isolation from
power spikes and surges. Manufacturers of these products may even provide
equipment damage warranties which will reimburse for surge damage to the
powered equipment while using their products. I am not sure how one proves
that the UPS was being used at the time, however!

It is still best to unplug everything if the air raid sirens go off or you
see an elephant wearing thick glasses running through the neighborhood (or an
impending lightning storm).

@node 6.6 "GFCI tripping with monitor (or other high tech equipment)"

Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) are very important for minimizing
shock hazards in kitchens, bathrooms, outdoors and other potentially wet
areas. They are now generally required by the NEC Code in these locations.
However, what the GFCI detects to protect people - an imbalance in the
currents in the Hot and Neutral wires caused possibly by someone touching a
live conductor - may exist safely by design in 3 wire grounded electronic
equipment and result in false tripping of the GFCI. The reason is that there
are usually small capacitors between all three wire - Hot, Neutral, and
Ground in the RFI line filters of computer monitors, PCs, and printers. At
power-on and even while operating, there may be enough leakage current
through the capacitors between Hot and Ground in particular to trip the GFCI.
Even for ungrounded 2 wire devices, the power-on surge into inductive or
capacitive loads like switching power supplies may falsely trip the GFCI.
This is more likely to happen with multiple devices plugged into the same
GFCI protected outlet especially if they are controlled by a common power
switch.

Therefore, I do not recommend the use of a GFCI for computer equipment as
long as all 3 wire devices are connected to properly grounded circuits. The
safety ground provides all the protection that is needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.7 "Why do power supplies seem to fail after a power outage?"

Startup is the most stressful time for a typical switchmode power supply. The
output filter capacitors as well as the load must be driven while the input
voltage is changing - possibly wildly. With careful design, these factors can
be taken into consideration. Not all power supplies are designed carefully or
thoroughly tested under all conditions. When power is restored, surges, dips,
brownouts, and multiple on-off cycles are possible. This is why it is always
recommended that electronic equipment be unplugged until power has been
restored and is stable.

@node 7.1 "Advanced troubleshooting"

If the solutions to your problems have not been covered in this document, you
still have some options other than replacement.

(Also see the related document: "Sources of Repair Information and General
Comments" as well as "Repair Briefs, an Introduction".)

Manufacturer's service literature: Service manuals may be available for for
your equipment. Once you have exhausted other obvious possibilities, the cost
may be well worth it. Depending on the type of equipment, these can range in
price from $5-100 or more. Sometimes, these may even be free (yes, even in
this day and age where you have to pay for free air at your local gas
station!) Some are more useful than others. However, not all include the
schematics so if you are hoping to repair an electronic problem try to check
before buying.

Inside cover of the equipment: TVs often have some kind of circuit diagram
pasted inside the back cover. In the old days, this was a complete schematic.
Now, if one exists at all for a monitor, it just shows part numbers and
location for key components - still very useful.

Sams Photofacts: These have been published for over 45 years mostly for TVs
and radios. There are some for VCRs and a few for some early PC monitors and
other pre-Jurassic computers. However, for the power supplies in TVs, there
will nearly always be a Sams with complete schematics.

Whatever the ultimate outcome, you will have learned a great deal. Have fun -
don't think of this as a chore. Electronic troubleshooting represents a
detective's challenge of the type hat Sherlock Holmes could not have
resisted.  You at least have the advantage that the electronics do not lie or
attempt to deceive you (though you may beg to differ at times). So, what are

@node 7.3 "Parts information"

I have found one of the most useful single sources for general information on
semiconductors to be the ECG Semiconductors Master Replacement Guide, about
$6 from your local Philips distributor. STK, NTE, and others have similar
manuals. The ECG manual will enable you to look up U.S., foreign, and
manufacturer 'house' numbers and identify device type, pinout, and other
information. Note that I am not necessarily recommending using ECG (or other
generic) replacements if the original replacements are (1) readily available
and (2) reasonably priced. However, the cross reference can save countless
hours searching through databooks or contacting the manufacturers. Even if
you have a wall of databooks, this source is invaluable. A couple of caveats:
(1) ECG crosses have been known to be incorrect - the specifications of the
ECG replacement part were inferior to the original. (2) Don't assume that the
specifications provided for the ECG part are identical to the original - they
may be better in some ways. Thus, using the ECG to determine the
specifications of the parts in your junk bin can be risky.

@node 7.4 "Information sources on the Internet"

Many manufacturers are now providing extensive information via the World Wide
Web. The answer to you question may be a mouse click away. Perform a net
search or just try to guess the manufacturer's home page address. The most
obvious is often correct. It will usually be of the form "http://www.xxx.com"
where xxx is the manufacturers' name, abbreviation, or acronym. For example,
Hewlett Packard is hp, Sun Microsystems is sun, Western Digital Corp. is wdc.
NEC is, you guessed it, nec. It is amazing what is appearing freely
accessible via the WWW. For example, monitor manufacturers often have

@node 7.5 "Interchangeability of components"

The question often arises: If I cannot obtain an exact replacement or if I
have a monitor, TV, or other equipment carcass gathering dust, can I
substitute a part that is not a precise match? Sometimes, this is simply
desired to confirm a diagnosis and avoid the risk of ordering an expensive
replacement and/or having to wait until it arrives.

For safety related items, the answer is generally NO - an exact replacement
part is needed to maintain the specifications within acceptable limits with
respect to line isolation, X-ray protection and to minimize fire hazards.
Typical parts of this type include flameproof resistors, some types of
capacitors, and specific parts dealing with CRT high voltage regulation.
However, during testing, it is usually acceptable to substitute electrically
equivalent parts on a temporary basis. For example, an ordinary 1 ohm
resistor can be substituted for an open 1 ohm flameproof resistor to
determine if there are other problems in the the SMPS chopper before placing
an order as long as you don't get lazy and neglect to install the proper type
before considering the repair complete.

For other components, whether a not quite identical substitute will work
reliably or at all depends on many factors. Some deflection circuits are so
carefully matched to a specific horizontal output transistor that no
substitute will be reliable.

Here are some guidelines:

  1. Fuses - same type (usually normal or fast blow), exact same current
     rating and at least equal voltage rating. I have often soldered a normal
     3AG size fuse onto a smaller blown 20 mm long fuse as a substitute.

  2. Resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, switches, potentiometers,
     LEDs, and other common parts - except for those specifically marked as
     safety-critical - substitution as long as the replacement part fits and
     specifications should be fine. It is best to use the same type - metal
     film resistor, for example. But for testing, even this is not a hard and
     fast rule and a carbon resistor should work just fine.

  3. Rectifiers - many of these are high efficiency and/or fast recovery
     types. Replacements should have equal or better PRV, Imax, and Tr
     specifications. However, the AC input bridge can usually be replaced
     with anything with at least equal voltage and current ratings.

  4. Main filter capacitor(s) - use replacements with at least equal working
     voltage and similar uF rating. For testing, even something with half the
     capacity will be fine. For the final replacement bigger is not always
     better and even using a smaller one (uF) will be fine as long as you are
     not running the supply near full load capacity. Use of a higher
     temperature rated capacitor than the original may be desirable as its
     life may have been shorteded by a hot environment. This practice will
     never hurt.

  5. Transistors and thyristors (except SMPS choppers or HOTs) - substitutes
     will generally work as long as their specifications meet or exceed those
     of the original. For testing, it is usually ok to use types that do not
     quite meet all of these as long as the breakdown voltage and maximum
     current specifications are not exceeded. However, performance (like
     regulation specifications) may not be quite as good. For power types,
     make sure to use a heatsink.

  6. SMPS chopper (or horizontal output) transistors - exact replacement is
     generally best but except for very high performance monitors, generic
     HOTs that have specifications that are at least as good will work in
     many cases. Make sure the replacement transistor has an internal damper
     diode if the original had one. For testing with a series light bulb,
     even a transistor that doesn't quite meet specifications should work
     well enough (and not blow up) to enable you to determine what else may
     be faulty. The most critical parameters are Vceo/Vcbo, Ic, and Hfe which
     should all be at least equal to the original transistor. I have often
     used by favorite BU208D as a temporary substitute for other HOTs and
     SMPS (chopper) transistors. Make sure you use a heatsink (with
     insulating washer if applicable) and thermal grease in any case - even
     if you have to hang the assembly with a cable-tie to make it fit.

The following are usually custom parts and substitution of something from
your junk box is unlikely to be successful even for testing: flyback (LOPT)
and SMPS transformers, interstage coils or transformers, microcontrollers,
and other custom programmed chips.

Substituting entire circuit boards and other modules from identical models
is, of course, possible and an excellent troubleshooting aid even if it is
only used to confirm or identify a bad part. However, if the original failure
was catastrophic, you do run some risk of damaging components on the
substitute circuit board as well.

@node 7.6 "Repair parts sources"

For general electronic components like resistors and capacitors, most
electronics distributors will have a sufficient variety at reasonable cost.
Even Radio Shack can be considered in a pinch.

However, for modern electronics equipment repairs, places like Digikey,
Allied, and Newark do not have the a variety of Japanese semiconductors like
ICs and transistors or any components like flyback transformers or degauss
Posistors.

The following are good sources for consumer electronics replacement parts,
especially for VCRs, TVs, and other audio and video equipment:
