@node 6 " Types of Parts Found in Small Appliances"

     6.1 So many, so few

While there are an almost unlimited variety of small appliances and power
tools, they are nearly all constructed from under two dozen basic types of
parts. And, even with these, there is a lot of overlap.

Battery and AC adapter powered appliance use most of the same types of parts
but they tend to be smaller and lower power than their line powered
counterparts. For example, motors in line powered devices tend to be larger,
more powerful, and of different design (universal or induction compared to
permanent magnet DC type).

The only major category of devices that these parts do not cover are gas
discharge lamps and lighting fixtures (fluorescent, neon, mercury, and
sodium), which we will discuss in a separate chapters.

@node 2 "Chapter 2) Introduction"

Where do you keep your dead appliances?

If you have ever tried to get a small household appliance or portable power
tool repaired, you understand why all that stuff is likely to be gathering
dust in your attic or basement closet or junk box. It does not pay! This may
be partially by design. However, to be fair, it may take just as much time to
diagnose and repair a problem with a $20 toaster as a $300 VCR and time is
money for a repair shop. It is often not even economical to repair the more
expensive equipment let alone a $40 electric heater. The cost of the estimate
alone would probably buy at least one new unit and possibly many more.

However, if you can do the repair yourself, the equation changes dramatically
as your parts costs will be 1/2 to 1/4 of what a professional will charge and
of course your time is free. The educational aspects may also be appealing.
You will learn a lot in the process. Many problems can be solved quickly and
inexpensively. Fixing an old vacuum cleaner to keep in the near the rec room
may just make sense after all.

This document provides maintenance and repair information for a large number
of household appliances. It will be expanded to include "Notes on the Repair
of Portable Power Tools" (Coming soon if not yet available) which may also be
of interest. The repair of consumer electronic equipment is dealt with by
other chapters in the "Notes on Repair of" series. Suggestions for additions
(and, of course, correction) are always welcome.

You will be able to diagnose problems and in most cases, correct them as
well.  Most problems with household appliances are either mechanical (e.g.,
dirt, lack of or gummed up lubrication, deteriorated rubber parts, broken
doohickies) or obvious electrical (e.g., broken or corroded connections,
short circuits, faulty heating elements) in nature. With minor exceptions,
specific manufacturers and models will not be covered as there are so many
variations that such a treatment would require a huge and very detailed text.
Rather, the most common problems will be addressed and enough basic
principles of operation will be provided to enable you to narrow the problem
down and likely determine a course of action for repair. In many cases, you
will be able to do what is required for a fraction of the cost that would be
charged by a repair center - or - be able to revive something that would
otherwise have gone into the dumpster - or remained in that closet until you
moved out of your house (or longer)!

Since so many appliances are variations on a theme - heating, blowing,
sucking, rotating, etc. - it is likely that even if your exact device does
not have a section here, a very similar one does. Furthermore, with your
understanding of the basic principles of operation, you should be able to
identify what is common and utilize info in other sections to complete a
repair.

Should you still not be able to find a solution, you will have learned a
great deal and be able to ask appropriate questions and supply relevant
information if you decide to post to sci.electronics.repair (recommended),
alt.home.repair, or misc.consumers.house. It will also be easier to do
further research using a repair textbook. In any case, you will have the
satisfaction of knowing you did as much as you could before finally giving up
or (if it is worthwhile cost-wise) taking it in for professional repair. With
your newly gathered knowledge, you will have the upper hand and will not
easily be snowed by a dishonest or incompetent technician.

   o The cause of a vacuum cleaner that starts blowing instead of sucking is
     likely a dirt clog somewhere. It is virtually impossible for the motor
     to spin in the wrong direction and even if it did, the vacuum would
     still have some suction due to the type of blower that is commonly used.

   o Many diagnoses of burned out motors are incorrect. Very often motor
     problems are actually something else - and minor. A truly burned out
     motor will often have died spectacularly and under adverse conditions.
     It will likely be smelly, charred, or may have created lots of sparks,
     tripped a circuit breaker or blew a fuse. A motor that just stopped
     working may be due to worn (carbon) brushes, dirt, or a fault elsewhere
     in the appliance like a bad connection or switch or circuit - or the AC
     outlet might be bad.

   o Fluorescent lamps use only 1/3 to 1/2 of the power of an incandescent
     lamp of similar light output. With all the lighting used in an average
     household, this can add up particularly for high power ceiling fixtures.
     However, fluorescent light color and quality may not be as aesthetically
     pleasing and fixtures or lamps may produce Radio Frequency Interference
     (RFI) causing problems with TV or radio reception. Dimmers can usually
     not be used unless they are specifically designed for fluorescent
     fixtures. Compact fluorescent lamps do indeed save energy but they can
     break just like any other light bulb!

   o The initial inrush current to an incandescent bulb may be 10 times the
     operating current. This is hard on switches and dimmers and is part of
     the reason behind why bulbs tend to burn out when switched on and not
     while just sitting there providing illumination. Furthermore, an erratic
     switch or loose connection can shorten the life of an incandescent bulb
     due to repeated thermal shock. And, these are not due to short circuits
     but bad intermittent connections. True short circuits are less common
     and should result in a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker.

   o A Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) protects people against shock
     but does not necessarily protect appliances from damage due to
     electrical faults. This is the function of fuses, circuit breakers, and
     thermal protectors.

@node 4.1 "What is inside an appliance?"

There isn't much rocket science in the typical small appliance (though that
is changing to some extent with the use of microcomputer and fuzzy logic
control). Everything represents variations on a relatively small number of
basic themes:

Heating
     A resistance element similar to what you can see inside a toaster
     provides heat to air, liquids, or solids by convections, conduction, or
     direct radiant (IR) heat.

Rotation, blowing, sucking
     A motor provides power to move air as in a fan or vacuum cleaner, water
     as in a sump pump, or provide drive as in an electric pencil sharpener,
     food mixer, or floor polisher.

Control
     Switches and selectors, thermostats and speed regulators, and
     microcomputers determine what happens, when, how much, and assure safe
     operation.

@node 4.2 "Basic electrical principles"

Relax! This is not going to be a tutorial on computer design. Appliances are
simple devices. It is possible to repair many appliance faults without any
knowledge beyond 'a broken wire is probably a problem' or 'this part is
probably bad because it is charred and broken in half'. However, a very basic
understanding of electrical principles will enable you to more fully
understand what you are doing. Don't worry, there will be no heavy math. The
most complicated equations will be variations on ohm's law: V=I*R and
P=V*V/R.

@endnode
@node 4.3 "Voltage, current, and resistance"

If you have any sort of background in electricity or electronics, then you
can probably skip the following introductory description - or have some
laughs at my expense.

The easiest way to explain basic electrical theory without serious math is
with a hydraulic analogy. This is of the plumbing system in your house:

Water is supplied by a pipe in the street from the municipal water company or
by a ground water pump. The water has a certain pressure trying to push it
through your pipes. With electric circuits, voltage is the analog to
pressure.  Current is analogous to flow rate. Resistance is analogous the
difficulty in overcoming narrow or obstructed pipes or partially open valves.

Intuitively, then, the higher the voltage (pressure), the higher the current
(flow rate). Increase the resistance (partially close a valve or use a
narrower pipe) and for a fixed voltage (constant pressure), the current (flow
rate) will decrease.

With electricity, this relationship is what is known as linear: double the
voltage and all other factors remaining unchanged, the current will double as
well. Increase it by a factor of 3 and the current will triple. Halve the
resistance and for a constant voltage source, the current will double. (For
you who are hydraulic engineers, this is not quite true with plumbing as
turbulent flow sets in, but this is just an analogy, so bear with me.)

NOTE: for the following 4 items whether the source is Direct Current (DC)
such as a battery or Alternating Current (AC) from a wall outlet does not
matter. The differences between DC and AC will be explained later.

The simplest electrical circuit will consist of several electrical components
in series - the current must flow through all of them to flow through any of
them. Think of a string of Christmas lights - if one burns out, they all go
out because the electricity cannot pass through the broken filament in the
burned out bulb.

Note the term 'circuit'. A circuit is a complete loop. In order for
electricity to flow, a complete circuit is needed.


                          Switch (3)
               _____________/ ______________
              |                             |
              | (1)                         | (4)

              |            Wiring (2)       |
              |_____________________________|

  1. Power source - a battery, generator, or wall outlet. The hydraulic
     equivalent is a pump or dam (which is like a storage battery). The water
     supply pipe in the street is actually only 'wiring' (analogous to the
     electric company's distribution system) from the water company's
     reservoir and pumps.

  2. Conductors - the wiring. Similar to pipes and aqueducts. Electricity
     flows easily in good conductors like copper and aluminum. These are like
     the insides of pipes. To prevent electricity from escaping, an insulator
     like plastic or rubber is used to cover the wires. Air is a pretty good
     insulator and is used with high power wiring such as the power company's
     high voltage lines but plastic and rubber are much more convenient as
     they allow wires to be bundled closely together.

  3. Switch - turns current on or off. These are similar to valves which do
     not have intermediate positions, just on and off. A switch is not
     actually required in a basic circuit but will almost always be present.

  4. Load - a light bulb, resistance heater, motor, solenoid, etc. In true
     hydraulic systems such as used to control the flight surfaces of an
     aircraft, there are hydraulic motors and actuators, for example.

With household water we usually don't think of the load.

Here are 3 of the simplest appliances:

   o Flashlight: battery (1), case and wiring (2), switch (3), light bulb
     (4).

   o Table lamp: wall outlet (1), line cord and internal wiring (2), power
     switch (3), light bulb (4).

   o Electric fan, vacuum cleaner, garbage disposer: wall outlet (1), line
     cord and internal wiring (2), power switch (3), motor (4).

Now we can add some simple control devices:

  1. Thermostat - a switch that is sensitive to temperature. This is like an
     automatic water valve which shuts off if a set temperature is exceeded.
     Most thermostats are designed to open the circuit when a fixed or
     variable temperature is exceeded. However, airconditioners,
     refrigerators, and freezers do the opposite - the thermostat switches on
     when the temperature goes too high. Some are there only to protect
     against a failure elsewhere due to a bad part or improper use that would
     allow the temperature to go too high and start a fire. Others are
     adjustable by the user and provide the ability to control the
     temperature of the appliance.

     With the addition of a thermostat, many more appliances can be
     constructed including (this is a small subset):

      o Electric space heater (radiant), broiler, waffle iron: wall outlet
        (1), line cord and internal wiring (2), power switch (3) and/or
        thermostat (5), load (heavy duty heating element).

      o Electric heater (convection), hair dryer: wall outlet (1), line cord
        and internal wiring (2), power switch (3) and/or thermostat (5),
        loads (4) (heating element and motor).

     Electric heaters and cooking appliances usually have adjustable
     thermostats.

     Hair dryers may simply have several settings which adjust heater power
     and fan speed (we will get into how later). The thermostat may be fixed
     and to protect against excessive temperatures only.

     That's it! You now understand the basic operating principle of nearly
     all small appliances. Most are simply variations (though some may be
     quite complex) on these basic themes. Everything else is just details.

     For example, a blender with 38 speeds just has a set of buttons
     (switches) to select various combinations of motor windings and other
     parts to give you complete control (as if you need 38 speeds!). Toasters
     have a timer or thermostat activate a solenoid (electromagnet) to pop
     your bread at (hopefully) the right time.

  2. Resistances - both unavoidable and functional. Except for
     superconductors, all materials have resistance. Metals like copper,
     aluminum, silver, and gold have low resistance - they are good
     conductors. Many other metals like iron or steel are fair but not quite
     as good as these four. One, NiChrome - an alloy of nickel and chromium -
     is used for heating elements because it does not deteriorate (oxidize)
     in air even at relatively high temperatures.

     A significant amount of the power the electric company produces is lost
     to heating of the transmission lines due to resistance and heating.

     However, in an electric heater, this is put to good use. In a flashlight
     or table lamp, the resistance inside the light bulb gets so hot that it
     provides a useful amount of light.

     A bad connection or overloaded extension cord, on the other hand, may
     become excessively hot and start a fire.

     The following is more advanced - save for later if you like.

  3. Capacitors - energy storage devices. These are like water storage tanks
     (and similar is some ways to rechargeable batteries).

     Capacitors are not that common in small appliances but may be used with
     some types of motors and in RFI - Radio Frequency Interference - filters
     as capacitors can buffer - bypass - interference to ground. The energy
     to power an electronic flash unit is stored in a capacitor, for example.
     Because they act like reservoirs - buffers - capacitors are found in the
     apower supplies of most electronic equipment to smooth out the various DC
     voltages required for each device.

  4. Inductors - their actual behavior is like the mass of water as it flows.
     Turn off a water faucet suddenly and you are likely to hear the pipes
     banging or vibrating. This is due to the inertia of the water - it tends
     to want to keep moving. Electricity doesn't have inertia but when wires
     are wound into tight coils, the magnetic field generated by electric
     current is concentrated and tends to result in a similar effect. Current
     tends to want to continue to flow where inductance is present.

     The windings of motors and transformers have significant inductance but
     the use of additional inductance devices is rare in home appliances
     except for RFI - since inductance tends to prevent current from
     changing, it can also be used to prevent interference from getting in or
     out.

  5. Controls - reostats and potentiometers allow variable control of current
     or voltage. A water faucet is like a variable resistor which can be
     varied from near 0 ohms (when on fully) to infinite ohms (when off).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.4 "Ohm's Law"

The relationships that govern the flow of current in basic circuits (without
capacitance or inductance - which is the case with many appliances) are
contained in a very simple set of equations known an Ohm's Law.

The simplest of these are:


            V = I * R (1)
            I = V / R (2) 
            R = V / I (3)

Where:


 V is Voltage in Volts (or millivolts - mV or kilovolts - KV).
 I is current in amperes (A) or milliamps (mA) 
 R is resistance in Ohms (ohms), kilo-Ohms (K Ohms), or mega-Ohms (M Ohms).

Power in watts (W) is equal to voltage times current in a resistive circuit
(no capacitance or inductance). Therefore, rearranging the equations above,
we also obtain:


            P = V * I      (4)
            P = V * V / R  (5)
            P = I * I * R  (6)

For example:

   o For a flashlight with a pair of Alkaline batteries (3 V) and a light
     bulb with a resistance of 10 ohms, we can use (2) to find that the
     current is I = (3 V) / (10 ohms) = .3 A. The from (4) we find that the
     power is: P = (3 V * .3 A) = .9 W.

   o For a blow-dryer rated at 1000 W, the current drawn from a 120 V line
     would be: I = P / V (by rearranging (4) = 1000 W / 120 V = 8.33 A.

As noted above:

   o Increase voltage -> higher current. (If the water company increases the
     pressure, your shower used more water in a given time.)

   o Decrease resistance -> higher current. (You have a new wider pipe
     installed between the street and your house. Or, you open the shower
     valve wider.)

(Note that the common use of the term 'water pressure' is actually not
correct. The most likely cause of what is normally described as low water
pressure is actually high resistance in the piping between your residence and
the street. There is a pressure drop in this piping just as there would be a
voltage drop across a high value resistor.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.5 "DC and AC"

While electricity can vary in any way imaginable, the most common forms for
providing power are direct current and alternating current:

A direct current source is at a constant voltage. Displaying the voltage
versus time plot for such a source would show a flat line at a constant
level.  Some examples:

   o Alkaline AA battery - 1.5 V (when new)
   o Automotive battery - 12 V (fully charged)
   o Camcorder battery - 7.2 V (charged)
   o Discman AC adapter - 9 VDC (fully loaded)
   o Electric knife AC adapter - 3.6 VDC

An Alternating Current (AC) source provides a voltage that is varying
periodically usually at 60 Hz (U.S.) or 50 Hz (many other countries). Note
that 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second. Therefore, a 60 Hz AC voltage goes through 60
complete cycles in each second. For power, the shape of the voltage is a
sinusoid which is the smoothest way that anything can vary periodically
between two levels.

The nominal voltage from an AC outlet in the U.S. is around 115 VAC. This is
the RMS (Root Mean Square) value, not the peak (0 to maximum). In simple
terms, the RMS value of an AC voltage and the same value of a DC voltage will
result in identical heating (power) to a resistive load. For example, 115 VAC
RMS will result in the same heat output of a broiler as 115 VDC.

Direct current is used for many small motor driven appliances particularly
when battery power is an option since changing DC into AC requires some
additional circuitry. All electronic equipment require various DC voltages
for their operation. Even when plugged into an AC outlet, the first thing
that is done internally (or in the AC adapter in many cases) is to convert
the AC to various DC voltages.

The beauty of AC is that a very simple device - a transformer - can convert
one voltage into another. This is essential to long distance power
distribution where a high voltage and low current is desirable to minimize
power loss (since it depends on the current). You can see transformers atop
the power poles in your neighborhood reducing the 2,000 VAC or so from a
local distribution transformer to your 115 VAC (actually, 115-0-115 were the
total will be used by large appliances like electric ranges and cloths
dryers). That 2,000 VAC was stepped down by a larger transformer from around
12,000 VAC provided by the local substation. This, in turn, was stepped down
from the 230,000 VAC or more used for long distance electricity transmission.
Some long distance lines are over 1,000,000 volts (MV).

When converting between one voltage and another with a transformer, the
amount of current (amps) changes in the inverse ratio. So, using 230 KV for
long distance power transmission results in far fewer heating losses as the
current flow is reduced by a factor of 2,000 over what it would be if the
voltage was only 115 V, for example. Recall that power loss from P=I*I*R is
proportional to the square of the current and thus in this example is reduced
by a factor of 4,000,000!

Many small appliances include power transformers to reduce the 115 VAC to
various lower voltages used by motors or or electrical components. Common AC
adapters - often simply called transformers or wall warts - include a small
transformer as well. Where their output is AC, this is the only internal
component other than a fuse or thermal fuse for protection. Where their
output is DC, additional components convert the low voltage AC from the
transformer to DC and a capacitor smooths it out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.6 "Series and parallel circuits"

Up until now, we have been dealing with the series circuit - all parts are in
a single line from power source, wiring, switches, load, and anything else.
In a series circuit, the current must be the same through all components. The
light bulb and switch in a flashlight pass exactly the same value of amperes.
If there were two light bulbs instead of one and they were connected in
series - as in a Christmas tree light set - then the current must be equal in
all the bulbs but the voltages across each one would be reduced.

The loads, say resistance heating elements, are now drawn with the schematic
symbol (as best as can be done using ASCII) for a resistor.


                          Switch

              |                             |   / R2
              |                        |   V2   \ Load 2
              |                        |    |   /
              |                        v    v   |
              |_________________________________|

The total resistance, R(T), of the resistors in this series circuit is:


            R(T) = R1 + R2                (7)

The voltage across each of the resistors would be given by:


            V1 = V(S) * R1 / (R1 + R2)    (8)
            V2 = V(S) * R2 / (R1 + R2)    (9)

The current is given by:


            I = V(S)  / (R1 + R2)        (10)

However, another basic configuration, is also possible. With a parallel
circuit, components are connected not one after the other but next to one
another as shown below:


                          Switch
               _____________/ ___________________________
              |                      I -->  |            |
              |                 ^           |            |
      +-------+--------+        |           / R1         / R2
      |  Power Source  |       V(S)         \ Load 1     \ Load 2
      +-------+--------+        |           /            /
              |                 v           |v I(1)      |v I(2)
              |_____________________________|____________|

Now, the voltages across each of the loads is necessarily equal but the
individual currents divide according to the relative resistances of each
load.

The total resistance, R(T), of the parallel resistors in this circuit is:


            R(T) = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2)  (11)

The currents through each of the loads would be given by:


            I1 = V(S)/R1                  (12)
            I2 = V(S)/R2                  (13)

The total current is given by:


            I = I1 + I2                   (14)

Many variations on these basic arrangements are possible but nearly all can
be reduced systematically to a combination of series or parallel circuits.

@endnode
@node 5.1 "Safety"

Appliances run on either AC line power or batteries. In the latter case,
there is little danger to you except possibly from burns due to short
circuits and heating effect or irritation from the caustic chemicals from old
leaky batteries.

However, AC line power can be lethal. Proper safety procedures must be
followed whenever working on live equipment (as well as devices which may
have high energy storage capacitors like TVs, monitors, and microwave ovens).
AC line power due to its potentially very high current is actually
considerably more dangerous than the 30 KV found in a large screen color TV!

These guidelines are to protect you from potentially deadly electrical shock
hazards as well as the equipment from accidental damage.

Note that the danger to you is not only in your body providing a conducting
path, particularly through your heart. Any involuntary muscle contractions
caused by a shock, while perhaps harmless in themselves, may cause collateral
damage - there are many sharp edges inside this type of equipment as well as
other electrically live parts you may contact accidentally.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.2 "Safety myths"

For nearly all the appliances we will be covering, there is absolutely no
danger of electrical shock once the unit is unplugged from the wall socket
(not, however, just turned off, but unplugged).

You may have heard warnings about dangers from unplugged appliances. Perhaps,
these were passed down from your great great grandparents or from local bar
room conversation.

Except for devices with large high voltage capacitors connected to the line
or elsewhere, there is nothing inside an appliance to store a painful or
dangerous charge. Even these situations are only present in microwave ovens,
fluorescent lamps and fixtures with electronic ballasts, universal power
packs for camcorders or portable computers, or appliances with large motors.
Other than these, once an appliance is unplugged all parts are safe to touch
- electrically that is. There may still be elements or metal brackets that
are burning hot as metal will tend to retain heat for quite a while in
appliances like toasters or waffle irons. Just give them time to cool. There
are often many sharp edges on sheetmetal as well. Take your time and look
before you leap or grab anything.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.3 "Safety guidelines"

The purpose of this set of guidelines is not to frighten you but rather to
make you aware of the appropriate precautions. Appliance repair can be both
rewarding and economical. Just be sure that it is also safe!

   o Don't work alone - in the event of an emergency another person's
     presence may be essential.

   o Always keep one hand in your pocket when anywhere around a powered
     line-connected or high voltage system.

   o Wear rubber bottom shoes or sneakers.

   o Wear eye protection - large plastic lensed eyeglasses or safety goggles.

   o Don't wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact
     circuitry and conduct current, or get caught in moving parts.

   o Set up your work area away from possible grounds that you may
     accidentally contact.

   o Know your equipment: small appliances with 2 prong plugs do not use any
     part of the outside case for carrying current. Any metal parts of the
     case will either be totally isolated or possibly connected to one side
     of the line through a very high value resistor and/or very low value
     capacitor. However, there may be exceptions. And, failures may occur.
     Appliances with 3 prong plugs will have the case and any exposed metal
     parts connected to the safety ground.

   o If circuit boards or other subassemblies need to be removed from their
     mountings, put insulating material between them and anything they may
     short to. Hold them in place with string or electrical tape. Prop them
     up with insulation sticks - plastic or wood.

   o Parts of heating appliances can get very hot very quickly. Always
     carefully test before grabbing hold of something you will be sorry about
     later.

   o If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits with power
     off, discharge (across) large power supply filter capacitors with a 2 W
     or greater resistor of 100-500 ohms/V approximate value (e.g., for a 200
     V capacitor use a 50 K ohm resistor). The only places you are likely to
     find large capacitors in appliance repair are in induction motor
     starting or running circuitry or the electronic ballasts of fluorescent
     fixtures.

   o Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered and
     unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped
     locations or difficult to access locations.

   o Perform as many tests as possible with the device unplugged. Even with
     the power switch supposedly off, if the unit is plugged into a live
     outlet, line voltage may be present in unexpected places or probing may
     activate a motor due to accidentally pressing a microswitch. Most parts
     in household appliances and power tools can be can be tested using only
     an ohmmeter or continuity checker.

   o If you must probe live, put electrical tape over all but the last 1/16"
     of the test probes to avoid the possibility of an accidental short which
     could cause damage to various components. Clip the reference end of the
     meter or scope to the appropriate ground return so that you need to only
     probe with one hand.

   o Use an isolation transformer if there is any chance of contacting line
     connected circuits. A Variac(tm) is not an isolation transformer!

     The use of a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet is
     a good idea but will not protect you from shock from many points in a
     line connected TV or monitor, or the high voltage side of a microwave
     oven, for example. (Note however, that, a GFCI may nuisance trip at
     power-on or at other random times due to leakage paths (like your scope
     probe ground) or the highly capacitive or inductive input
     characteristics of line powered equipment.) A fuse or circuit breaker is
     too slow and insensitive to provide any protection for you or in many
     cases, your equipment. However, these devices may save your scope probe
     ground wire should you accidentally connect it to a live chassis.

   o Don't attempt repair work when you are tired. Not only will you be more
     careless, but your primary diagnostic tool - deductive reasoning - will
     not be operating at full capacity.

   o Finally, never assume anything without checking it out for yourself!
     Don't take shortcuts!

@node 5.4 "Should I unplug appliances when not in use?"

There is no hard and fast rule. Personally, I do unplug heating appliances
when I am done with them. The quality of internal construction is not always
that great and this is a minor annoyance to avoid a possible fire hazard
should something fail or should such an appliance accidentally be left on.

BTW, electronic equipment should always be unplugged during lightning storms
since it may be very susceptible to power surge and lightning damage. Don't
forget the telephones and computer modems as well. This is not as much of a
problem with small appliances that do not include electronic controllers as
except for direct lightning strikes, the power switch will provide
protection.

@node 5.5 "Troubleshooting tips"

Many problems have simple solutions. Don't immediately assume that your
problem is some combination of esoteric complex convoluted failures. For a
dead appliance, the most likely cause might just be a bad line cord or plug!
Try to remember that the problems with the most catastrophic impact on
operation (an appliance that blows fuses) usually have the simplest causes (a
wire shorting due to frayed insulation).

If you get stuck, sleep on it. Sometimes, just letting the problem bounce
around in your head will lead to a different more successful approach or
solution. Don't work when you are really tired - it is both dangerous and
mostly non-productive (or possibly destructive - especially with AC line
powered appliances).

Whenever working on precision equipment, make copious notes and diagrams.
Yes, I know, a toaster may not exactly be precision equipment, but trust me.
You will be eternally grateful when the time comes to reassemble the unit.
Most connectors are keyed against incorrect insertion or interchange of
cables, but not always. Apparently identical screws may be of differing
lengths or have slightly different thread types. Little parts may fit in more
than one place or orientation. Etc. Etc.

Pill bottles, film canisters, and plastic ice cube trays come in handy for
sorting and storing screws and other small parts after disassembly.

Select a work area which is well lighted and where dropped parts can be
located - not on a deep pile shag rug. Something like a large plastic tray
with a slight lip may come in handy as it prevents small parts from rolling
off of the work table. The best location will also be relatively dust free
and allow you to suspend your troubleshooting to eat or sleep or think
without having to pile everything into a cardboard box to eat dinner.

A basic set of precision hand tools will be all you need to work on most
appliances. These do not need to be really expensive but poor quality tools
are worse than useless and can cause damage. Stanley and Craftsman tools are
fine. Needed tools include a selection of Philips and straight blade
screwdrivers, socket drivers, open end or adjustable wrenchs of various
sizes, needlenose pliers, wire cutters, tweezers, and dental picks.

An electric drill or drill press with a set of small (1/16" to 1/4") high
quality high speed drill bits is handy for some types of restoration where
new holes need to be provided. A set of machine screw taps is also useful at
times.

A medium power soldering iron and rosin core solder (never never use acid
core solder or the stuff for sweating copper pipes on electrical or
electronic repairs!) will be required if you need to make or replace any
soldered connections. A soldering gun is desirable for any really beefy
soldering. See the section: @{"Soldering techniques" link "5.6"}

A crimping tool and an assortment of solderless connectors often called
'lugs' will be needed to replace damaged or melted terminals in small
appliances. See the section: @{"Solderless connectors" link "5.7"}

Old dead appliances can often be valuable sources of hardware and sometimes
even components like switches and heating elements. While not advocating
being a pack rat, this does have its advantages at times.

@endnode
@node 5.6 "Soldering techniques"

Soldering is a skill that is handy to know for many types of construction and
repair. For modern small appliances, it is less important than it once was as
solderless connectors have virtually replaced solder for internal wiring.

However, there are times where soldering is more convenient. Use of the
proper technique is critical to reliability and safety. A good solder
connection is not just a bunch of wires and terminals with solder dribbled
over them. When done correctly, the solder actually bonds to the surface of
the metal (usually copper) parts.

Effective soldering is by no means difficult but some practice may be needed
to perfect your technique.

The following guidelines will assure reliable solder joints:

   o Only use rosin core solder (e.g., 60/40 tin/lead) for electronics work.
     A 1 pound spool will last a long time and costs about $10. Suggested
     diameter is .030 to .060 inches for appliances. The smaller size is
     preferred as it will be useful for other types of precision electronics
     repairs or construction as well. The rosin is used as a flux to clean
     the metal surface to assure a secure bond. NEVER use acid core solder or
     the stuff used to sweat copper pipes! The flux is corrosive and it is
     not possible to adequately clean up the connections afterward to remove
     all residue.

   o Keep the tip of the soldering iron or gun clean and tinned. Buy tips
     that are permanently tinned - they are coated and will outlast countless
     normal copper tips. A quick wipe on a wet sponge when hot and a bit of
     solder and they will be as good as new for a long time. (These should
     never be filed or sanded).

   o Make sure every part to be soldered - terminal, wire, component leads -
     is free of any surface film, insulation, or oxidation. Fine sandpaper or
     an Xacto knife may be used, for example, to clean the surfaces. The
     secret to a good solder joint is to make sure everything is perfectly
     clean and shiny and not depend on the flux alone to accomplish this.

   o Start with a strong mechanical joint. Don't depend on the solder to hold
     the connection together. If possible, loop each wire or component lead
     through the hole in the terminal. If there is no hole, wrap them once
     around the terminal. Gently anchor them with a pair of needlenose
     pliers.

   o Use a properly sized soldering iron or gun: 20-25 W iron for fine
     circuit board work; 25-50 W iron for general soldering of terminals and
     wires and power circuit boards; 100-200 W soldering gun for chassis and
     large area circuit planes. With a properly sized iron or gun, the task
     will be fast - 1 to 2 seconds for a typical connection - and will result
     in little or no damage to the circuit board, plastic switch housings,
     insulation, etc. Large soldering jobs will take longer but no more than
     5 to 10 seconds for a large expanse of copper. If it is tating too long,
     your iron is undersized for the task, is dirty, or has not reached
     operating temperature. For appliance work there is no need for a fancy
     soldering station - a less than $10 soldering iron or $25 soldering gun
     as appropriate will be all that is required.

   o Heat the parts to be soldered, not the solder. Touch the end of the
     solder to the parts, not the soldering iron or gun. Once the terminal,
     wires, or component leads are hot, the solder will flow via capillary
     action, fill all voids, and make a secure mechanical and electrical
     bond. Sometimes, applying a little from each side will more effectively
     reach all nooks and crannies.

   o Don't overdo it. Only enough solder is needed to fill all voids. The
     resulting surface should be concave between the wires and terminal, not
     bulging with excess solder.

   o Keep everything absolutely still for the few seconds it takes the solder
     to solidify. Otherwise, you will end up with a bad connection - what is
     called a 'cold solder joint'.

   o A good solder connection will be quite shiny - not dull gray or
     granular. If your result is less than perfect reheat it and add a bit of
     new solder with flux to help it reflow.

Practice on some scrap wire and electronic parts. It should take you about 3
minutes to master the technique!

Occasionally, it will be necessary to remove solder - either excess or to
replace wires or components. A variety of tools are available for this
purpose. The one I recommend is a vacuum solder pump called 'SoldaPullet'
(about $20). Cock the pump, heat the joint to be cleared, and press the
trigger. Molten solder is sucked up into the barrel of the device leaving the
terminal nearly free of solder. Then use a pair of needlenose pliers and a
dental pick to gently free the wires or component. Other approaches that may
be used in place of or in addition to this: Solder Wick which is a copper
braid that absorbs solder via capillary action; rubber bulb type solder
pumps, and motor driven vacuum solder rework stations (pricey).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.7 "Solderless connectors"

Most internal connections in small appliances are made using solderless
connectors. These include twist on WireNuts(tm) and crimped terminal lugs of
various sizes and configurations.

WireNuts allow multiple wires to be joined by stripping the ends and then
'screwing' an insulated thimble shaped plastic nut onto the grouped ends of
the wires. A coiled spring (usually) inside tightly grips the bare wires and
results in a mechanically and electrically secure joint. For appliance
repair, the required WireNuts will almost always already be present since
they can usually be reused. If you need to purchase any, they come in various
sizes depending on the number and size of the wires that can be handled. It
is best to twist the individual conductor strands of each wire together and
then twist the wires together slightly before applying the WireNut.

Crimped connectors, called lugs, are very common in small appliances. One
reason is that it is easier, faster, and more reliable, to make connections
using these lugs with the proper crimping equipment than with solder.

A lug consists of a metal sleeve which gets crimped over one or more wires,
an insulating sleeve (usually, not all lugs have these), and a terminal
connection: ring, spade, or push-on are typical.

Lugs connect one or more wires to the fixed terminals found on switches,
motors, thermostats, and so forth.

There are several varieties:

   o Ring lugs - the end looks like an 'O' and must be installed on a
     threaded terminal of similar size to the opening in the ring. The screw
     or nut must be removed to replace a ring lug.

   o Spade lugs - the end looks like a 'U' and must be installed on a
     threaded terminal of similar size to the opening in the spade. These can
     be slipped on and off without entirely removing the screw or nut.

   o Push-on lugs - called 'FastOns' by one manufacturer. The push-on
     terminal makes a tight fit with a (usually) fixed 'flag'. There may also
     be a latch involved but usually just a pressure fit keeps the connection
     secure. However, excessive heat over time may weaken these types of
     connections, resulting in increased resistance, additional heating, and
     a bad connection or melt-down.

The push-on variety are most common in small appliances.

In the factory, the lugs are installed on the wires with fancy expensive
equipment. For replacements, an inexpensive crimping tool and an assortment
of lugs will suffice. The crimping tool looks like a pair of long pliers and
usually combines a wire stripper and bolt cutter with the crimping function.
It should cost about $6-10.

The crimping tool 'squashes' the metal sleeve around the stripped ends of the
wires to be joined. A proper crimp will not come apart if an attempt is made
to pull the wires free - the wires will break somewhere else first. It is
gas-tight - corrosion (within reason) will not affect the connection.

Crimping guidelines:

   o Use the proper sized lug. Both the end that accepts the wire(s) and the
     end that screws or pushes on must be sized correctly. Easiest is to use
     a replacement that is identical to the original. Where this is not
     possible, match up the wire size and terminal end as closely as
     possible. There will be a minimum and maximum total wire cross sectional
     area that is acceptable for each size. Avoid the temptation to trim
     individual conductor strands from wires that will not fit - use a larger
     size lug. Although not really recommended, the bare wires can be doubled
     over to thicken them for use with a lug that is slightly oversize.

   o For heating appliances, use only high temperature lugs. This will assure
     that the connections do not degrade with repeated temperature cycles.
   o Strip the wire(s) so that they fit into the lug with just a bit showing
     out the other (screw or push-on) end. Too long and your risk
     interference with the terminals and/or shorting to other terminals. Too
     short and it is possible that one or more wires will not be properly
     positioned, will not be properly crimped, and may pull out or make a
     poor connection. The insulation of the wires should be within the
     insulating sleeve - there should be no bare wire showing behind the lug.

   o Crimp securely but don't use so much force that the insulating sleeve or
     metal sleeve is severed. Usually 1 or 2 crimps for the actual wire
     connection and 1 crimp to compress the insulating sleeve will be needed.

   o Test the crimp when complete - there should be no detectable movement of
     the wires. If there is, you didn't crimp hard enough or the lug is too
     large for your wires.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.8 "Wire stripping"

In order to make most connections, the plastic or other insulating covering
must be removed to expose the bare copper conductors inside. The best way to
do this is with a proper wire stripper which is either adjustable or has
dedicated positions for each wire size. It is extremely important that the
internal conductor (single wire or multiple strands) are undamaged. Nicks or
loss of some strands reduces the mechanical and electrical integrity of the
connection. In particular, a seriously nicked wire may break off at a later
time - requiring an additional repair or resulting in a safety hazard or
additional damage. The use of a proper wire stripper will greatly minimize
such potential problems.

A pen knife or Xacto knife can be used in a pinch but a wire stripper is
really much much easier.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.9 "Attaching wires to screw terminals"

Screw terminals are often seen in appliances. In most cases, lugs are used to
attach one or more wires to each terminal and when properly done, this
usually is the best solution. However, in most cases, you can attach the
wire(s) directly if a lug is not available:

  1. The best mechanical arrangement is to put the wire under a machine screw
     or nut, lock washer, and flat washer. However, you will often see just
     the screw or nut (as in a lamp switch or wall socket). For most
     applications, this is satisfactory.

  2. Avoid the temptation to put multiple wires around a single terminal
     unless you separate each one with a flat washer.

  3. Strip enough of the wire to allow the bare wire to be wrapped once
     around the terminal. To much and some will poke out and might short to
     something; too little and a firm mechanical joint and electrical
     connection may be impossible.

  4. For multistranded wire, tightly twist the strands of stripped wire
     together in a clockwise direction as viewed from the wire end.

  5. Wrap the stripped end of the wire **clockwise** around the terminal post
     (screw or stud) so that it will be fully covered by the screw head, nut,
     or flat washer. This will insure that the wire is grabbed as the screw
     or nut is tightened. A pair of small needlenose pliers may help.

  6. Hold onto the wire to keep it from being sucked in as the screw or nut
     is tightened. Don't overdo it - you don't need to sheer off the head of
     the screw to make a secure reliable connection.

  7. Inspect the terminal connection: the bare wire should be fully covered
     by the head of the screw, nut, or flat washer. Gently tug on the wire to
     confirm that it is securely fastened.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.10 "Test equipment"

Very little test equipment is needed for most household appliance repair.

First, start with some analytical thinking. Many problems associated with
household appliances do not require a schematic. Since the internal wiring of
many appliances is so simple, you will be able to create your own by tracing
the circuits in any case. However, for more complex appliances, a schematic
may be useful as wires may run behind and under other parts and the operation
of some custom switches may not obvious. The causes for the majority of
problems will be self evident once you gain access to the interior - loose
connections or broken wires, bad switches, open heating element, worn motor
brushes, dry bearings. All you will need are some basic hand tools, a circuit
and continuity tester, light oil and grease, and your powers of observation
(and a little experience). Your built in senses and that stuff between your
ears represents the most important test equipment you have.

The following will be highly desirable for all but the most obvious problems:

  1. Circuit tester (neon light) - This is used to test for AC power or
     confirm that it is off. For safety, nothing can beat the simplicity of a
     neon tester. Its use is foolproof as there are no mode settings or range
     selections to contend with. Touch its two probes to a circuit and if it
     lights, there is power. (This can also take the place of an Outlet
     tester but it is not as convenient (see below). Cost: $2-$3.

  2. Outlet tester (grounds and miswiring) - This will confirm that a 3 prong
     outlet is correctly wired with respect to Hot, Neutral, and Ground.
     While not 100% assured of correct wiring if the test passes, the screwup
     would need to be quite spectacular. This simple device instantly finds
     missing Grounds and interchanged Hot and Neutral - the most common
     wiring mistakes. Just plug it into an outlet and if the proper two neon
     light are lit at full brightness, the outlet is most likely wired
     correctly. Cost: about $6.

     These are just a set of 3 neon bulbs+resistors across each pair of
     wires. If the correct bulbs light at full brightness - H-N, H-G - then
     the circuit is likely wired correctly. If the H-G light is dim or out or
     if both the H-G and G-N are dim, then you have no ground. If the N-G
     light is on and the H-G light is off, you have reversed H and N, etc.

  3. Continuity tester (buzzer or light) - Since most problems with
     appliances boil down to broken connections, open heating elements,
     defective switches, shorted wires, and bad motor windings, a continuity
     tester is all that is needed for most diagnosis. A simple battery
     operated buzzer or light bulb quickly identifies problems. If a
     connection is complete, the buzzer will sound or the light will come on.
     Note that a dedicated continuity tester is preferred over a similar mode
     on a multimeter because it will operate only at very low resistance. The
     buzzer on a multimeter sounds whenever the resistance is less than about
     200 ohms - a virtual open circuit for much appliance wiring.

     A continuity tester can be constructed very easily from an Alkaline
     battery, light bulb or buzzer, some wire, and a set of test leads with
     probes. All of these parts are available at Radio Shack.


             AA, C, or D cell    1.5 V flashlight bulb or buzzer
                    +|  -             +------------------+
 Test    o-----------| |--------------|  Bulb or buzzer  |-------+ 
 probe 1             |                +------------------+       |
                                                                 |
 Test    o-------------------------------------------------------+
 probe 2

     CAUTION: Do not use this simple continuity tester on electronic
     equipment as there is a slight possibility that the current provided by
     the battery will be too high and cause damage. It is fine for most
     appliances.

  4. Multimeter (VOM or DMM) - This is necessary for actually measuring
     voltages and resistances. Almost any type will do - even the $14.95
     special from Sears. Accuracy is not critical for household appliance
     repair but reliability is important - for your safety if no other
     reason. It doesn't really matter whether it is a Digital MultiMeter
     (DMM) or analog Volt Ohm Meter (VOM). A DMM may be a little more robust
     should you accidentally put it on an incorrect scale. However, they both
     serve the same purpose. A cheap DMM is also not necessarily more
     accurate than a VOM just because it has digits instead of a meter
     needle. A good quality well insulated set of test leads and probes is
     essential. What comes with inexpensive multimeters may be too thin or
     flimsy. Replacements are available. Cost: $15-$50 for a multimeter that
     is perfectly adequate for home appliance repair.

Once you get into electronic troubleshooting, an oscilloscope, signal
generator, and other advanced (and expensive) test equipment will be useful.
For basic appliance repair, such equipment would just gather dust.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.11 "Getting inside consumer electronic equipment"

Yes, you will void the warranty, but you knew this already.

Appliance manufacturers seem to take great pride in being very mysterious as
to how to open their equipment. Not always, but this is too common to just be
a coincidence.

A variety of techniques are used to secure the covers on consumer electronic
equipment:

Screws
     Yes, many still use this somewhat antiquated technique. Sometimes, there
     are even embossed arrows on the case indicating which screws need to be
     removed to get at the guts. In addition to obvious screw holes, there
     may be some that are only accessible when a battery compartment is
     opened or a trim panel is popped off.

     These are almost always of the Philips variety though more and more
     appliances are using Torx or security Torx type screws. Many of these
     are hybrid types - a slotted screwdriver may also work but the Philips
     or Torx is a whole lot more convenient.

     A precision jeweler's screwdriver set including miniature Philips head
     drivers is a must for repair of miniature portable devices.

Hidden screws
     These will require prying up a plug or peeling off a decorative decal.
     It will be obvious that you were tinkering - it is virtually impossible
     to put a decal back in an undetectable way. Sometimes the rubber feet
     can be pryed out revealing screw holes. For a stick-on label, rubbing
     your finger over it may permit you to locate a hidden screw hole. Just
     puncture the label to access the screw as this may be less messy then
     attempting to peel it off.

Snaps
     Look around the seam between the two halves. You may (if you are lucky)
     see points at which gently (or forcibly) pressing with a screwdriver
     will unlock the covers. Sometimes, just going around the seam with a
     butter knife will pop the cover at one location which will then reveal
     the locations of the other snaps.

Glue
     Or more likely, the plastic is fused together. This is particularly
     common with AC adapters (wall warts). In this case, I usually carefully
     go around the seam with a hacksaw blade taking extreme care not to go
     through and damage internal components. Reassemble with plastic
     electrical tape.

It isn't designed for repair
     Don't laugh. I feel we will see more and more of this in our disposable
     society. Some devices are totally potted in Epoxy and are throwaways.
     With others, the only way to open them non-destructively is from the
     inside.

Don't force anything unless you are sure there is no alternative - most of
the time, once you determine the method of fastening, covers will come apart
easily. If they get hung up, there may be an undetected screw or snap still
in place.

The most annoying (to be polite) situation is when after removing the 18
screws holding the case together (losing 3 of them entirely and mangling the
heads on 2 others), removing three subassemblies, and two other circuit
boards, you find that the adjustment you wanted was accessible through a hole
in the case just by partially peeling back a rubber hand grip! (It has
happened to me).

When reassembling the equipment make sure to route cables and other wiring
such that they will not get pinched or snagged and possibly broken or have
their insulation nicked or pierced and that they will not get caught in
moving parts. This is particularly critical for AC line operated appliances
and those with motors to minimize fire and shock hazard and future damage to
the device itself. Replace any cable ties that were cut or removed during
disassembly and add additional ones of your own if needed. Some electrical
tape may sometimes come in handy to provide insulation insurance as well. As
long as it does not get in the way, additional layers of tape will not hurt
and can provide some added insurance against future problems. I often put a
layer of electrical tape around connections joined with WireNuts(tm) as well
just to be sure that they will not come off or that any exposed wire will not
short to anything.

@node 5.12 "Getting built up dust and dirt out of a equipment"

This should be the first step in any inspection and cleaning procedure.

Appliances containing fans or blowers seem to be dust magnets - an incredible
amount of disgusting fluffy stuff can build up in a short time - even with
built-in filters.

Use a soft brush (like a new cheap paint brush) to remove as much dirt, dust,
and crud, as possible without disturbing anything excessively. Some gentle
blowing (but no high pressure air) may be helpful in dislodged hard to get at
dirt - but wear a dust mask.

Don't use compressed air on intricate mechanisms, however, as it might
dislodge dirt and dust which may then settle on lubricated parts and
contaminating them. High pressure air could move oil or grease from where it
is to where it should not be. If you are talking about a shop air line, the
pressure may be much much too high and there may be contaminants as well.

A Q-tip (cotton swab) moistened with politically correct alcohol can be used
to remove dust and dirt from various hard to get at surfaces.

@endnode
@node 5.13.1 "Broken wiring inside cordset"

Internal breaks in the conductors of cordsets or other connecting cords
caused by flexing, pulling, or other long term abuse. This is one of the most
common problem with vacuum cleaners which tend to be dragged around by their
tails.

Testing: If the problem is intermittent, (or even if it is not), plug the
appliance in and turn it on. Then try bending or pushing the wire toward the
plug or appliance connector end to see if you can make the internal
conductors touch at least momentarily. Ii the cordset is removable, test
between ends with a continuity checker or multimeter on the low ohms scale.
If it is not detachable, open the appliance to perform this test.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.13.2 "Bad internal connections"

Broken wires, corroded or loosened terminals. Wires may break from vibration,
corrosion, poor manufacturing, as well as thermal fatigue. The break may be
in a heating element or other subassembly. In many cases, failure will be
total as in when one of the AC line connections falls off. At other times,
operation will be intermittent or erratic - or parts of the appliance will
not function. For example, with a blow dryer, the heating element could open
up but the fan may continue to run properly.

Testing: In many cases, a visual inspection with some careful flexing and
prodding will reveal the location of the bad connection. If it is an
intermittent, this may need to be done with a well insulated stick while the
appliance is on and running (or attempting to run). When all else fails, the
use of a continuity checker or multimeter on the low ohms scale can identify
broken connections which are not obviously wires visibly broken in two. For
testing heating elements, use the multimeter as a continuity checker may not
be sensitive enough since the element normally has some resistance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.13.3 "Short circuits"

While much less frequent than broken or intermittent connections, two wires
touching or contacting the metal case of an appliance happens all too often.
Partially, this is due to the shoddy manufacturing quality of many small
appliances like toaster ovens. These also have metal (mostly) cabinets and
many metal interior parts with sharp edges which can readily eat through wire
insulation due to repeated vibrations, heating and cooling cycles, and the
like. Many appliances are apparently designed by engineers (this is being
generous) who do not have any idea of how to build or repair them. Thus,
final assembly, for example, must sometimes be done blind - the wires get
stuffed in and covers fastened - which may end up nicking or pinching wires
between sharp metal parts. The appliance passes the final inspection and
tests but fails down the road.

A short circuit may develop with no operational problems - but the case of
the appliance will be electrically 'hot'. This is a dangerous situation.
Large appliances with 3 wire plugs - plugged into a properly grounded 3 wire
circuit - would then blow a fuse or trip a circuit breaker. However, small
appliances like toaster, broilers, irons, etc., have two wire plugs and will
just set there with a live cabinet.

Testing: Visually inspect for bare wires or wires with frayed or worn
insulation touching metal parts, terminals they should not be connected to,
or other wires. Use a multimeter on the high ohms scale to check between both
prongs of the AC plug and any exposed metal parts. Try all positions of any
power or selector switches. Any resistance measurement less than 100K ohms or
so is cause for concern - and further checking. Also test between internal
terminals and wires that should not be connected together.

Too many people like to blame everything from blown light bulbs to strange
noises on short circuits. A 'slight', slow, or marginal short circuit is
extremely rare. Most short circuits in electrical wiring between live and
neutral or ground (as opposed to inside appliances where other paths are
possible) will blow a fuse or trip a breaker. Bad connections (grounds,
neutral, live), on the other hand, are much much more common.

@endnode
@node 5.13.4 "Worn, dirty, or broken switches or thermostat contacts."

These will result in erratic or no action when the switch is flipped or
thermostat knob is turned. In many cases, the part will feel bad - it won't
have that 'click' it had when new or may be hard to turn or flip. Often,
however, operation will just be erratic - jiggling the switch or knob will
make the motor or light go on or off, for example.

Testing: Where there is a changed feel to the switch or thermostat with an
associated operational problem, there is little doubt that the part is bad
and must be replaced. Where this is not the case, label the connections to
the switch or thermostat and then remove the wires. Use the continuity
checker or ohmmeter across each set of contacts. They should be 0 ohms or
open depending on the position of the switch or knob and nothing in between.
In most cases, you should be able to obtain both readings. The exception is
with respect to thermostats where room temperature is off one end of their
range. Inability to make the contacts open or close (except as noted above)
or erratic intermediate resistances which are affected by tapping or jiggling
are a sure sign of a bad set of contacts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.13.5 "Gummed up lubrication, or worn or dry bearings"

Most modern appliances with motors are supposedly lubricated for life. Don't
believe it! Often, due to environmental conditions (dust, dirt, humidity) or
just poor quality control during manufacture (they forgot the oil), a motor
or fan bearing will gum up or become dry resulting in sluggish and/or noisy
operation and overheating. In extreme cases, the bearing may seize resulting
in a totally stopped motor. If not detected, this may result in a blown fuse
(at the least) and possibly a burnt out motor from the overheating.

Testing: If the appliance does not run but there is a hum (AC line operated
appliances) or runs sluggishly or with less power than you recall when new,
lubrication problems are likely. With the appliance unplugged, check for free
rotation of the motor(s). In general, the shaft sticking out of the motor
itself should turn freely with very little resistance. If it is difficult to
turn, the motor bearings themselves may need attention or the mechanism
attached to the motor may be filled with crud. In most cases, a thorough
cleaning to remove all the old dried up and contaminated oil or grease
followed by relubing with similar oil or grease as appropriate will return
the appliance to good health. Don't skimp on the disassembly - total cleaning
will be best. Even the motor should be carefully removed and broken down to
its component parts - end plates, rotor, stator, brushes (if any) in order to
properly clean and lubricate its bearings. See the section: @{"Chapter 14" link "14"}
"Disassembling and reassembling of..." for the motor type in your appliance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.13.6 "Broken or worn drive belts or gears"

Rotating parts do not rotate or turn slowly or with little power even through
the motor is revving its little head off. When the brush drive belt in an
upright vacuum cleaner breaks, the results are obvious and the broken belt
often falls to the ground (to be eaten by the dog or mistaken for a mouse
tail - Eeek!) However, there are often other belts inside appliances which
will result in less obvious consequences when they loosen with age or fail
completely.

Testing: except for the case of a vacuum cleaner where the belt is readily
accessible, open the appliance (unplugged!). A good rubber belt will be
perfectly elastic and will return to its relaxed length instantly when
stretched by 25 percent and let go. It will not be cracked, shiny, hard, or
brittle. A V-type belt should be dry (no oil coating), undamaged (not
cracked, brittle, or frayed), and tight (it should deflect 1/4" to 1/2" when
pressed firmly halfway between the pulleys).

Sometimes all that is needed is a thorough cleaning with soap and water to
remove accumulated oil or grease. However, replacement will be required for
most of these symptoms. Belts are readily available and an exact match is
rarely essential.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.13.7 "Broken parts"

Plastic or metal castings, linkages, washers, and other doodads are often not
constructed quite the way they used to be. When any of these fail, they can
bring a complicated appliance to its knees. Failure may be caused by normal
wear and tear, improper use (you tried to vacuum nuts and bolts just like on
TV), accidents (why was your 3 year old using the toaster oven as a step
stool?), or shoddy manufacturing.

Testing: In many cases, the problem will be obvious. Where it is not, some
careful detective work - putting the various mechanisms through their paces -
should reveal what is not functioning. Although replacement parts may be
available, you can be sure that their cost will be excessive and
improvization may ultimately be the best approach to repair. See the section:
@{"Fil's tips on improvised parts repair" link "16.2"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.1 "Cordsets - wire and plug"

A 'cordset' is a combination of the cord consisting of 2 or 3 insulated wires
and a plug with 2 or 3 prongs. Cord length varies from 12 inches (or less)
for some appliances like toasters to 25 feet or more for vacuum cleaners.
Most common length is 6-8 feet.

Most plug-in appliances in the U.S. will have one of 3 types of line
cord/plug combinations:

  1. Non-polarized 2 prong. The 2 prongs are of equal width so the plug may
     be inserted in either direction. These are almost universal on older
     appliances but may be found on modern appliances as well which are
     double insulated or where polarity does not matter. (NOTE: it MUST not
     matter for user safety in any case. The only time it can matter
     otherwise is with respect to (1) possible RFI (Radio Frequency
     Interference) generation or (2) service safety (this would put the
     center contact of a light bulb socket or internal switch and fuse on the
     Hot wire).

  2. Polarized 2 prong. The prong that is supposed to be plugged into the
     Neutral slot of the outlet is wider. All outlets since sometime around
     the 1950s (???) have been constructed to accept polarized plugs only one
     way. While no appliance should ever be designed where the way it is
     plugged in can result in a user safety hazard, a lamp socket where the
     shell - the screw thread part - is plugged into Neutral is less
     hazardous when changing a light bulb. In addition, when servicing a
     small appliance with the cover removed, the Hot wire with a polarized
     plug should go to the switch and fuse and thus most of the circuitry
     will be disconnected with the switch off or fuse pulled.

  3. Grounded 3 prong. In addition to Hot and Neutral, a third grounding
     prong is provided to connect the case of the equipment to safety Ground.
     This provides added protection should internal wiring accidentally short
     to a user accessible metal cabinet or control. In this situation, the
     short circuit will (or is supposed to) blow a fuse or trip a circuit
     breaker or GFCI rather than present a shock hazard. DO NOT just cut off
     the third prong if your outlet does not have a hole for it. Have the
     outlet replaced with a properly grounded one (which may require pulling
     a new wire from the service panel). As a short term solution, the use of
     a '3 to 2' prong adapter is acceptable IF AND ONLY IF the outlet box is
     securely connected to safety Ground already (BX or Romex cable with
     ground). Grounding also is essential for surge suppressors to operate
     properly (to the extent that they ever do) and may reduce RFI
     susceptibility and emissions if line filters are included (as with
     computer equipment and consumer electronics). Power conditioners require
     the Ground connection for line filtering as well.

Each of these may be light duty (less than 5 Amps or 600 Watts), medium duty
(8 A or 1000 W) or heavy duty (up to 15 A or 1800 W). The rating is usually
required to be stamped on the cord itself or on a label attached to the cord.
Thickness of the cord is not a reliable indication of its power rating!
(NOTE: U.S. 115 VAC 15 amp circuits are assumed throughout this document
unless otherwise noted.)

Light duty cordsets are acceptable for most appliances without high power
heating elements or heavy duty electric motors. These include table lamps,
TVs, VCRs, stereo components, computers, dot matrix and inkjet printers,
thermal fax machines, monitors, fans, can openers, etc. Electric blankets,
heating pads, electric brooms, and food mixers are also low power and light
duty cordsets are acceptable. The internal wires used is #18 AWG which is the
minimum acceptable wire size (highest AWG number) for any AC line powered
device.

Medium or heavy duty cordsets are REQUIRED for heating appliances like
electric heaters (both radiant and convection), toasters, broilers, steam and
dry irons, coffee makers and electric kettles, microwave and convection
ovens, laser printers, photocopiers, Xerographic based fax machines, canister
and upright vacuum cleaners and shop vacs, floor polishers, many portable and
most stationary power tools. The internal wires used will be #16 AWG (medium
duty) or #14 AWG (heavy duty).

For replacement, always check the nameplate amps or wattage rating and use a
cordset which has a capacity at least equal to this. The use of an inadequate
cordset represents a serious fire hazard.

Three prong grounded cordsets are required for most computer equipment, heavy
appliances, and anything which is not double insulated and has metal parts
that may be touched in normal operation (i.e., without disassembly).

In general, when replacement is needed, use the same configuration and length
and a heavy duty type if the original was heavy duty. Substituting a heavy
duty cordset for a light duty one is acceptable as long as the additional
stiffness is acceptable in terms of convenience. A shorter cord can usually
be used if desired. In most cases, a longer cord (within reason) can be
substituted as well. However, performance of heavy duty high current high
wattage appliances may suffer if a really long cord (or extension cord) is
used voltage drop from the wire resistance. For a modest increase in length,
use the next larger wire size (heavy duty instead of medium duty, #14 instead
of #16, for example).

Common problems: internal wiring conductors broken at flex points (appliance
or plug). With yard tools, cutting the entire cord is common. The connections
at the plug may corrode as well resulting in heating or a broken connection.

Testing: appliance cordsets can always be tested with a continuity checker or
multimeter on a the low ohms scale.

NOTE: broken wires inside the cordset at either the plug or appliance end are
among the most common causes of a dead vacuum cleaner due to abuse it gets -
being tugged from the outlet, vacuum being dragged around by the cord, etc.
Many other types of appliances suffer the same fate. Therefore, checking the
cord and plug should be the first step in troubleshooting any dead appliance.

If the cord is broken at the plug end, the easiest thing to do is to replace
just the plug. A wide variety of replacement plugs are available of three
basic types: clamp-on/insulation piercing, screw terminals, and wire
compression.

Clamp-on/insulation piercing plugs are installed as follows: First, the cord
is cleanly cut but not stripped and inserted into the body of the plug. A lid
or clamping bar is then closed which internally pierces the insulation and
makes contact with the prongs. When used with the proper size wire, these are
fairly reliable for light duty use - table lamps and other low power
appliances. However, they can lead to problems of intermittent or bad
connections if the wire insulation thickness does not precisely match what
the plug expects.

Plugs with screw terminals make a much more secure robust connections but
require a bit more time and care in assembly to assure a proper connection
and avoid stray wire strands causing short circuits or sticking out and
representing a shock hazard. Tightly twist the strands of the stripped wire
together before wrapping around the screw in a clockwise direction before
tightening. Don't forget to install the fiber insulator that is usually
supplied with the plug.

The best plugs have wire clamp terminals. The stripped end of the wire is
inserted into a hole and a screw is tightened to clamp the wire in place.
Usually, a molded plastic cover is then screwed over this assembly and
includes a strain relief as well. These are nearly foolproof and consequently
are used in the most demanding industrial and medical applications. They are,
not surprisingly, also typically the most expensive.

Where damage is present at the appliance end of the cord, it may be possible
to just cut off the bad portion and reinstall what remains inside of the
appliance. As long as this is long enough and a means can be provided for
adequate strain relief, this is an acceptable alternative to replacement of
the entire cordset.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.2 "Extension cords"

We treat extension cords too casually - abusing them and using underated
extension cords with heavy duty appliances. Both of these are serious fire
and shock hazards. In addition, the use of a long inadequate extension will
result in reduced voltage due to resistive losses at the far end. The
appliance may not work at full capacity and in some cases may even be damaged
by this reduced voltage.

Extension cord rules of use:

  1. The capacity must be at least equal to the SUM of the wattages or
     amperages of all the appliances plugged in at the far end. Larger is
     fine as well and is desirable for long extensions. Check the rating
     marked on the cord or a label attached to the cord. Thickness of the
     outside of the cord is not a reliable indication of power rating.

  2. Use a type which is the most restrictive of any appliances that will be
     plugged in (e.g., 3 prong if any are of this type, 2 prong polarized
     otherwise unless your outlest are non-polarized (old dwellings).

  3. Use only as long an extension as required. For very long runs, use a
     higher capacity extension even if the power requirements are modest.

  4. NEVER run extensions under carpeting as damage is likely and this will
     go undetected. Never run extensions inside walls. Add new outlets where
     needed with properly installed building wire (Romex). This must be done
     in such a way that it meets the National Electric Code (NEC) in your
     area. It may need to be inspected if for no other reason than to
     guarantee that your homeowner's insurance won't give you a hard time
     should any 'problems' arise. Surface mount outlets and conduit are
     available to extend the reach of existing outlets with minimal
     construction if adding new ones is difficult or too costly.

  5. Don't use heavy duty extensions as a long term solution if possible.
     Similarly, don't use extensions with 'octopus' connections - install an
     outlet strip.

Extension cords of any type, capacity, and length can be easily constructed
from components and wire sold at most hardware stores and home centers. This
is rarely economical for light duty polarized types as these are readily
available and very inexpensive. However, for heavy duty 3 prong extensions, a
custom constructed one is likely to save money especially if an unusual
length is required. Making up a heavy duty extension with a 'quad' electrical
box with a pair of 15 amp duplex outlets is a very rugged convenient
alternative to a simple 3 prong socket.

Common problems: internal wiring conductors broken at flex points (socket or
plug). With yard tools, cutting the entire cord is common. The connections at
the plug may corrode as well resulting in heating or a bad or intermittent
connection.

Testing: extension cords can always be tested with a continuity checker or
multimeter on a the low ohms scale.

@endnode
@node 6.1.3 "Switches - power, selector, mode"

Most appliances have at least one switch to turn the appliance on and off. In
some cases, this may be combined with a thermostat or other control. However,
switches serve a variety of functions as well.

   o Power - Nearly all appliances that run on AC directly (no wall
     transformer) provide some means of completely disconnecting at least one
     side of the AC line when not in use. This may be a rocker, slide,
     push-push, trigger, toggle, rotary, or other separate switch. It may
     also be combined with another function like a speed control or
     thermostat.

     In all cases, the function of a switch is the same - to physically make
     (on) or break (off) the circuit.

   o Selector, mode, function - these switches may be used to determine speed
     in a mixer or blender, or the heat or air-only setting on a blow-dryer,
     for example.

   o Internal (not user accessible) - these perform functions like detecting
     the position of a mechanism (e.g., limit switch), cam operated timing,
     and other similar operations that are not directly performed by the
     user.

Common problems with switches include: dirt, worn, or melted contacts, broken
plastic or fiber parts, bad connections to terminals.

Testing: switches can always be tested with a continuity checker or a
multimeter on a low ohms scale.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.4 "Electrical Protection devices - fuses and circuit breakers"

The purpose of fuses and circuit breakers is to protect both the wiring from
heating and possible fire due to a short circuit or severe overload and to
prevent damage to the equipment due to excess current resulting from a failed
component or improper use (using a normal carpet vacuum to clear a flooded
basement).

Fuses use a fine wire or strip (called the element) made from a metal which
has enough resistance (more than for copper usually) to be heated by current
flow and which melts at a relatively low well defined temperature. When the
rated current is exceeded, this element heats up enough to melt (or
vaporize). How quickly this happens depends on the extent of the overload and
the type of fuse.

Fuses found in consumer electronic equipment are usually cartridge type -
1-1/4" mm x 1/4" or 20 mm x 5 mm, pico fuses that look like green 1/4 W
resistors, or other miniature varieties. Typical circuit board markings are F
or PR.

Circuit breakers may be thermal, magnetic, or a combination of the two. Small
(push button) circuit breakers for appliances are nearly always thermal -
metal heats up due to current flow and breaks the circuit when its
temperature exceeds a set value. The mechanism is often the bending action of
a bimetal strip or disc - similar to the operation of a thermostat. Flip type
circuit breakers are normally magnetic. An electromagnet pulls on a lever
held from tripping by a calibrated spring. These are not usually common in
consumer equipment (but are used at the electrical service panel).

At just over the rated current, it may take minutes to break the circuit. At
10 times rated current, the fuse may blow or circuit breaker may open in
milliseconds.

The response time of a 'normal' or 'rapid action' fuse or circuit breaker
depends on the instantaneous value of the overcurrent.

A 'slow blow' or 'delayed action' fuse or circuit breaker allows
instantaneous overload (such as normal motor starting) but will interrupt the
circuit quickly for significant extended overloads or short circuits. A large
thermal mass delays the temperature rise so that momentary overloads are
ignored. The magnetic type breaker adds a viscous damping fluid to slow down
the movement of the tripping mechanism.

Common problems: fuses and circuit breakers occasionally fail for no reason
or simply blow or trip due to a temporary condition such as a power surge.
However, most of the time, there is usually some other fault with the
appliance which will require attention like a bad motor or shorted wire.

Testing: fuses and circuit breakers can be tested for failure with a
continuity checker or multimeter on the low ohms scale. A fuse that tests
open is blown and must be replaced (generally, once the circuit problem is
found and repaired.) Of course, if the fuse element is visible, a blown fuse
is usually easy to identify without any test equipment. A circuit breaker
that tests open or erratic after the reset button is pressed, will need
replacement as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.5 "Fuse post mortems"

Quite a bit can be inferred from the appearance of a blown fuse if the inside
is visible as is the case with a glass cartridge type. One advantage to the
use of fuses is that this diagnostic information is often available!

   o A fuse which has an element that looks intact but tests open may have
     just become tired with age. Even if the fuse does not blow, continuous
     cycling at currents approaching its rating or instantaneous overloads
     results in repeated heating and cooling of the fuse element. It is quite
     common for the fuse to eventually fail when no actual fault is present.

   o A fuse where the element is broken in a single or multiple locations
     blew due to an overload. The current was probably more than twice the
     fuse's rating but not a dead short.

   o A fuse with a blackened or silvered discoloration on the glass where the
     entire element is likely vaporized blew due to a short circuit.

This information can be of use in directly further troubleshooting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.6 "Fuse or circuit breaker replacement"

As noted, sometimes a fuse will blow for no good reason. Replace fuse, end of
story. In this situation, or after the problem is found, what are the rules
of safe fuse replacement? It is inconvenient, to say the least, to have to
wait a week until the proper fuse arrives or to tromp out to Radio Shack in
the middle of the night.

Even with circuit breakers, a short circuit may so damage the contacts or
totally melt the device that replacement will be needed.

Four parameters characterizes a fuse or circuit breaker:

  1. Current rating - this should not be exceeded (you have heard about not
     putting pennies in fuse boxes, right?) (The one exception to this rule
     is if all other testing fails to reveal which component caused the fuse
     to blow in the first place. Then, and only then, putting a larger fuse
     in or jumpering across the fuse **just for testing** will allow the
     faulty component to identify itself by smoking or blowing its top!) A
     smaller current rating can safely be used but depending on how close the
     original rating was to the actual current, this may blow immediately.

  2. Voltage rating - this is the maximum safe working voltage of the circuit
     (including any inductive spikes) which the device will safety interrupt.
     It is safe to use a replacement with equal or high voltage rating.

  3. Type - normal, fast blow, slow blow, etc. It is safe to substitute a
     fuse or circuit breaker with a faster response characteristic but there
     may be consistent or occasional failure mostly during power-on. The
     opposite should be avoided as it risks damage to the equipment as
     semiconductors tend to die quite quickly.

  4. Mounting - it is usually quite easy to obtain an identical replacement.
     However, as long as the other specifications are met, soldering a normal
     1-1/4" (3AG) fuse across a 20 mm fuse is perfectly fine, for example.
     Sometimes, fuses are soldered directly into an appliance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.7 "Thermal protection devices - thermal fuses and thermal switches"

These devices protect against excessive temperature due to either a fault in
the appliance (locked motor overheating), improper use (blow dryer air
blocked).

There are three typical types:

  1. Thermal fuses. This is similar to an electrical fuse but is designed to
     break the circuit at a specific temperature. These are often found in
     heating appliances like slow cookers or coffee percolators or buried
     under the outer covering of motor windings or transformers. Some also
     have an electrical fuse rating as well. Like electrical fuses, these are
     one-time only parts. A replacement that meets both the thermal and
     electrical rating (if any) is required.

  2. Thermal switches or thermal protectors (strip type). These use a strip
     of bimetal similar to that used in a thermostat. Changes in temperature
     cause the strip to bend and control a set of contacts - usually to to
     break a circuit if the set temperature is exceeded. Commonly found in
     blow dryers and other heating appliances with a fixed selection of heat
     settings. They may also be found as backup protection in addition to
     adjustable thermostats.

  3. Thermal switches or thermal protectors (disk). These use a disk of
     bimetal rather than a strip as in most thermostats. The disk is formed
     slightly concave and pops to the opposite shape when a set temperature
     is exceeded. This activates a set of contacts to break (usually) a
     circuit if the rated temperature is exceeded. They may also be found as
     backup protection in addition to adjustable thermostats. A typical
     thermal switch is a small cylindrical device (i.e., 3/4" diameter) with
     a pair of terminals and a flange that is screwed to the surface whose
     temperature is to be monitored.

In some applications, device types (2) and (3) may be used as the primary
temperature regulating controls where adjustment is not needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.8 "Adjustable thermostats"

These are use to regulate the temperature in heating or cooling type
appliances. Common uses include heaters, airconditioners, refrigerators,
freezers, hair dryers and blow dryers, toaster ovens and broilers, waffle
irons, etc. These are distinguished from the thermal switches discussed above
in that they usually allow a variable temperature setting.

Four types are typically found in appliances. The first three of these are
totally mechanically controlled:

  1. Bimetal strip. When two metals with different coefficients of thermal
     expansion are sandwiched together (possibly by explosive welding), the
     strip will tend to bend as the temperature changes. For example, if the
     temperature rises, it will curve towards the side with the metal of
     lower coefficient of expansion.

     In a thermostat, the bimetal strip operates a set of contacts which make
     or break a circuit depending on temperature. In some cases the strip's
     shape or an additional mechanism adds 'hysteresis' to the thermostat's
     characteristics (see the section: @{"What is hysteresis" link "6.1.10"}

  2. Bimetal disk. This is similar to (1) but the bimetal element is in the
     shape of a concave disk. These are not common in adjustable thermostats
     but are the usual element in an overtemperature switch (see the section:
     @{"Thermal protection devices - thermal fuses and thermal switches" link "6.1.7"}

  3. Fluid operated bellows. These are not that common in small appliances
     but often found in refrigerators, airconditioners, baseboard heaters,
     and so forth. An expanding fluid (alcohol is common) operates a bellows
     which is coupled to a set of movable contacts. As with (1) and (2)
     above, hysteresis may be provided by a spring mechanism.

     Other variations on these basic themes are possible but (1)-(3) cover
     the vast majority of common designs.

     Testing of mechanical thermostats: examine for visible damage to the
     contacts. Use a continuity checker or ohmmeter to confirm reliable
     operation as the knob or slider is moved from end to end if it will
     switch at room temperature. Gently press on the mechanism to get the
     contacts to switch if this is not possible. Use an oven on low or a
     refrigerator or freezer if needed to confirm proper switching based on
     temperature.

  4. Electronic thermostats. These typically use a temperature variable
     resistance (thermistor) driving some kind of amplifier or logic circuit
     which then controls a conventional or solid state relay or thyristor.

Testing of electronic thermostats: This would require a schematic to
understand exactly what they are intended to do. If a relay is used, then the
output contacts could perhaps be identified and tested. However, substitution
is probably the best approach is one of these is suspected of being
defective.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.9 "Adjustable humidistats"

Humidistats, as their name implies, are used to sense relative humidity in
humidifiers and dehumidifiers. Their sensing material is something that looks
kind of like cellophane or the stuff that is used for sausage casings. It
contracts and expands based on the moisture content of the air around it.
These are somewhat fragile so if rotating the control knob on a humidifier or
dehumidifier does not result in the normal 'click', this material may have
been damaged or broken.

Testing of mechanical humidistats: examine for visible damage to the
contacts.  Use a continuity checker or ohmmeter to confirm reliable operation
as the knob or slider is moved from end to end. Gently press on the mechanism
to get the contacts to switch if this is not possible. Gently exhale across
the sensing strip to confirm that the switching point changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.10 "What is hysteresis"

An intuitive explanation of hysteresis is that it is a property of a system
where the system wants to remain in the state that it is in - it has memory.

Examples of systems with hysteresis:

   o Thermostats - without hysteresis your heater would be constantly
     switching on and off as the temperature changed. A working thermostat
     has a few degrees of hysteresis. As the temperature gradually increases,
     at some point the thermostat switches off. However, the temperature then
     needs to drop a few degrees for it to switch on again.

   o Toggle switches - the click of a toggle switch provides hysteresis to
     assure that small vibrations, for example, will not accidentally flip
     the switch.

Examples of systems which ideally have little or no hysteresis:

   o Audio amplifiers - input vs. output.

   o Pendulums on frictionless bearings - force vs. position.

Hysteresis is usually added thermostats by the use of a spring mechanism
which causes the mechanism to want to be in either the open or closed
position but not in between. Depending on the appliance, there may be
anywhere from 0 hysteresis (waffle iron) to 5-10 degrees F (space heater).
Sometimes, the thermal mass of the heated device or room provides the
hysteresis since any change to the temperature will not take place
instantaneously since the heating element is separated from the thermostat by
a mass of metal. Therefore, some overshoot - which in effect performs the
same function as a hysteresis mechanism - will take place.

@node 6.1.11 "Reostats and potentiometers"

These controls are usually operated by a knob or a slide adjustment and
consist of a stationary resistance element and a wiper that can be moved to
determine where on the fixed element it contacts. In some cases, they are not
actually user controls but are for internal adjustments. In other cases, they
are operated by the mechanism automatically and provide a means of sensing
position or controlling some aspect of the operation.

Reostats provide a resistance that can be varied. Usually, the range is from
0 ohms to some maximum value like 250 ohms. They are used to control things
like speed and brightness just by varying the current directly, or via an
electronic controller (see the section: @{"Electronic controllers" link "6.1.22"}


                 B >-------------+
                                 |

                 A >--------/\/\/\/\/\--
                         250 ohm reostat

In the diagram above, the resistance changes smoothly from 0 to 250 ohms as
the wiper moves from left to right. Many variations are possible.

Testing: disconnect at least one of the terminals from the rest of the
circuit and then measure with an ohmmeter on the appropriate scale. The
resistance should change smoothly and consistently with no dead spots or
dips.

Potentiometers are either operated by a knob or a slide adjustment and
implement a variable resistance between two end terminals as shown below.
This can be used to form a variable voltage divider. A potentiometer (or
'pot' for short) can be used like a reostat by simply not connecting one end
terminal. These are most often used with electronic controllers.


                 B >-------------+
                                 |

                 A >--------/\/\/\/\/\--------< C
                       1K ohm potentiometer

In the diagram above, the resistance between A and B varies smoothly from 0
to 1K ohms as the wiper moves from left to right. At the same time, the
resistance between B and C varies smoothly from 1K to 0 ohms. For some
applications, the change is non-linear - audio devices in particular so that
the perceived effect is more uniform across the entire range.

Testing: disconnect at least two of the terminals from the rest of the
circuit and then measure with an ohmmeter on the appropriate scale. The
resistance should change smoothly and consistently with no dead spots or
dips.  Try between each end and the wiper. Check the resistance across the
end terminals as well - it should be close to the stamped rating (if known).

Reostats and potentiometers come in all sizes from miniature circuit board
mounted 'trimpots' to huge devices capable of handling high power loads. The
resistance element may be made of fine wire ('wirewound') or a carbon
composition material which is silkscreened or painted on.

@endnode
@node 6.1.12 "Interlocks - prevent operation with case or door open"

Most of these are simple switches mechanically activated by the case or door.
Sometimes, optical or magnetic interlocks are used (rare on small appliances
but common on things like printers). Line cords that are firmly attached to
the case and disconnect automatically when the case is removed are another
example of an interlock. Interlocks may be designed to prevent injury during
normal operation (e.g.. food processor blades will not start when cover is
removed) or during servicing (remove AC power to internal circuits with case
removed).

  1. Interlock switches. Various kinds of small switches may be positioned in
     such a way that they disconnect power when a door is opened or cover is
     removed. These may fail due to electrical problems like worn or dirty
     contacts or mechanical problems like a broken part used to activate the
     interlock.

     Testing: Use an ohmmeter or continuity checker on the switches. The
     reading should either be 0 ohms or infinite ohms. Anything in between or
     erratic behavior is indication of a bad switch or cord.

  2. Attached cordset. Should the case be opened, the cord goes with the case
     and therefore no power is present inside the appliance. To get around
     this for servicing, a 'cheater cord' is needed or in many cases the
     original can be easily unfastened and used directly.

     Testing: Use an ohmmeter or continuity check to confirm that both wires
     of the cord are connected to both AC plug and appliance connector.
     Wiggle the cord where it connects to the appliance and at the plug end
     as well to see if there might be broken wires inside.

@endnode
@node 6.1.13 "Light bulbs - incandescent and fluorescent"

Small incandescent light bulbs are often used in appliances for interior
lighting or spot illumination. The common 'appliance bulb' is simply a
ruggedized 40 W incandescent light bulb in a clear glass envelope. Other
types are found in vacuum cleaners, microwave overs, makeup mirrors, and so
forth.

Testing: visual inspection will often reveal a burnt out incandescent light
bulb simply because the filament will be broken. If this is not obvious, use
an ohmmeter - an infinite resistance means that the bulb is bad.

Small fluorescent lamps are often found in makeup mirrors, plant lights, and
battery powered lanterns.

Testing: the best test for a bad fluorescent bulb is to substitute a known
good one. Unfortunately, there is no easy go-no go test for a fluorescent
lamp. Other parts of the lamp or fixture (like the ballast or starter) could
also be bad.

See the sections on the appropriate lamp type for additional information.

@endnode
@node 6.1.14 "Indicators - incandescent or neon light bulbs or LEDs"

Whereas lighting fixtures using incandescent or fluorescent bulbs are
designed to illuminate a room or small area, an indicator is simply there to
let you know that an appliance is on or in a specific mode.

There are three common types of electrical indicator lights:

  1. Incandescent bulbs. Just like their larger cousins, an incandescent
     indicator or pilot light has a filament that glows yellow or white hot
     when activated by a usually modest (1.5-28 V) source. Flashlight bulbs
     are very similar but usually have some mechanical method of keeping the
     filament positioned reasonably accurately so that the light can be
     focussed by a reflector or lens. Since the light spectrum of
     incandescent indicators is quite broad, filters can be used to obtain
     virtually any colored light. Incandescent indicator lamps do burn out
     just like 100 W bulbs if run near their rated voltage. However, driving
     these bulbs at reduced voltage can prolong their life almost
     indefinitely.

     Incandescent indicator lamps are often removable using a miniature
     screw, bayonet, or sliding type base. Some are soldered in via wire
     leads. Others look like cartridge fuses.

     Testing: visual inspection will often reveal a burnt out incandescent
     light bulb simply because the filament will be broken. If this is not
     obvious, use an ohmmeter - an infinite resistance is means that the bulb
     is bad.

  2. Neon lamps. These are very common as AC line power indicators because
     they are easy to operate directly from a high voltage requiring only a
     high value series resistor.

     They are nearly all the characteristic orange neon color although other
     colors are possible and there is a nice bright green variety with an
     internal phosphor coating that can actually provide some illumination as
     well. While neon bulbs do not often burn out in the same sense as
     incandescent lamps, they do darken with age and may eventually cease to
     light reliably so flickering of old Neon bulbs is quite common.

     Some Neon bulbs come in a miniature bayonet base. Most are soldered
     directly into the circuit via wire leads.

     Testing: Inspect for a blackened glass envelope. Connect to AC line
     (careful - dangerous voltage) through a series 100K resistor. If glow is
     weak or absent, Neon bulb is bad.

  3. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). LEDs come in a variety of colors - red,
     yellow, and green are very common; blue is just appearing. These run on
     low voltage (1.7-3 V) and relatively low currents (1-20 mA). Thus, they
     run cool and are easily controlled by low voltage logic circuits. LEDs
     have displaced incandescent lamps in virtually all electronic equipment
     indicators and many appliances. Their lifetime easily exceeds that of
     any appliance so replacement is rarely needed.

     LEDs are almost always soldered directly into the circuit board since
     they rarely need replacement.

     Testing: Use a multimeter on the diode test scale. An LED will have a
     forward voltage drop of between 1.7 and 3 V. If 0 or open, the LED is
     bad. However, note: some DMMs may not produce enough voltage on the
     diode test scale so the following is recommended: Alternative: Use a 6
     to 9 V DC supply in series with a 470 ohm resistor. LED should light if
     the supply's positive output is on the LED's anode. If in doubt, try
     both ways, If the LED does not light in either direction, it is bad.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.15 "Heating elements - NiChrome coils or ribbon, Calrod, Quartz"

All heating elements perform the same function: convert electricity into
heat.  In this they have one other characteristic in common: they are all
nearly 100% efficient. The only electrical energy which does not result in
heat is the slight amount of light (usually red-orange) that is produced by a
hot element.

There are 3 basic types of heating elements. Nearly every appliance on the
face of the planet will use one of these:

  1. NiChrome coil or ribbon. NiChrome is an alloy of Nickel and Chromium
     which has several nice properties for use in heating appliances - First,
     it has a modest resistance and is thus perfect for use in resistance
     heating elements. It is easily worked, is ductile, and is easily formed
     into coils of any shape and size. NiChrome has a relatively high melting
     point and will pretty much retain its original shape and most
     importantly, it does not oxidize or deteriorate in air at temperatures
     up through the orange-yellow heat range.

     NiChrome coils are used in many appliances including toasters,
     convection heaters, blow-dryers, waffle irons and clothes dryers.

     The main disadvantage for our purposes is that it is usually not
     possible to solder this material due to the heating nature of its
     application. Therefore, mechanical - crimp or screw must be used to join
     NiChrome wire or ribbon to another wire or terminal. The technique used
     in the original construction is may be spot welding which is quick and
     reliable but generally beyond our capabilities.

     Testing: visual inspection should reveal any broken coil or ribbon. If
     inspection is difficult, use a multimeter on the low ohms scale. Check
     for both shorts to the metal chassis as well as an open element
     (infinite ohms).

  2. Calrod(tm) enclosed element. This encloses a fine coiled NiChrome wires
     in a ceramic filler-binder inside a tough metal overcoat in the form of
     a shaped rod with thick wire leads or screw or plug-in terminals.

     These are found in toaster oven/broilers, hot plates, coffee makers,
     crock pots and slow cookers, electric range surface elements,
     conventional and convection ovens and broilers.

     Testing: When these fail, it is often spectacular as there is a good
     chance that the internal NiChrome element will short to the outer
     casing, short out, and melt. If there is no visible damage but the
     element does not work, a quick check with an ohmmeter should reveal an
     open element or one that is shorted to the outer casing.

  3. Quarts incandescent tube. These are essentially tubular high power
     incandescent lamps, usually made with a quartz envelope and thus their
     name.

     These are found in various kinds of radiant heaters. By running a less
     than maximum power - more orange heat - the peak radiation is in the
     infra-red rather than visible range.

     Testing: look for a broken filament. Test with an ohmmeter just like an
     incandescent light bulb.

@node 6.1.16 "Solenoids - small and large"

Solenoids are actuators operated by electromagnets that are used to operate
valves, slide or engage various parts, eject or prevent opening of a door,
and other functions. While shapes and sizes may vary, all electrically
operated solenoids use an electromagnet - AC or DC - to pull on a movable
piece called an armature which generally moves back and forth but rotary
motion is also possible.

Solenoids are usually two position devices - they are not used to provide
intermediate amounts of force or travel like motors.

Sizes ranges from small 1/2" long units providing a fraction of an ounce of
force and 1/8" travel to large 3" long units providing many pounds of force
with travels of 2" or more.

Testing: Inspect for free movement. Use an ohmmeter to confirm that the coil
is intact. There could be other problems like shorted turns in the coil but
these would be less common than lack of lubrication or an open coil. Check
voltage on operating solenoid to determine whether drive power is present.

@endnode
@node 6.1.17 "Small electronic components - resistors, capacitors, diodes"

A variety of small electronic components may be found in appliances though
unlike true electronic equipment, these do not usually run the show.

   o Resistors - may be used in various ways to adjust the current flowing in
     part of a circuit. Many different types of resistors are possible - tiny
     carbon or metal film types looking like small cylindrical objects often
     with colored bands which indicate the value.

   o Power resistors - larger cylindrical or rectangular often ceramic
     coated. These may get quite hot during operation. Their resistance value
     and power rating are usually printed on the resistor.

   o Capacitors - a variety of shapes and sizes. Some may look like disks,
     jelly beans, cylinders, boxes, etc. Their value is often marked in uF or
     pF.

   o Diodes or rectifiers - solid state devices that permit electric current
     to only flow in one direction (positive current in the direction of the
     arrow when marked this way). These are most often used in appliances to
     change AC to DC or to cut the power to a motor or heater (by allowing
     only half of the AC current to pass).

For more information on these types of components, see any good introductory
electronics text.

@node 6.1.18 "Motors - universal, induction, DC, timing"

A large part of the functionality of modern appliances is based on the use of
motors of one form or another. We devote an entire chapter to motors. The
following is just an introduction.

Motors come in all shapes and sizes but most found in small appliances can be
classified into 5 groups:

  1. Universal motors.
  2. Single phase induction motors
  3. Shaded pole induction motors.
  4. Small permanent magnet DC motors.
  5. DC brushless motors.
  6. Synchronous timing motors.

See the chapter: @{"Motors 101" link "14"} for more detailed information on the common
types of motors found in small appliances.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.19 "Fans and Blowers - bladed or centrifugal"

The entire purpose of a particular appliance may be to move air or this may
simply be needed for cooling. Obviously, portable and window fans are an
example of the former. However, many appliances have built in fans you may
not even be aware of as part of the motor(s) or other rotating components.

There are two primary types of configurations:

  1. Bladed fans - we are all familiar with the common desk or window fan.
     This uses a set of rotating blades - typically 3-5 to gather and direct
     air. In the specific case of an oscillating desk fan, a gear drive
     linked to the motor also permits the general direction of air movement
     to be controlled in a back-and-forth motion. I recently saw one where in
     addition to moving back and forth, the front grille can be set to rotate
     at an adjustable rate providing more variation in air flow.

     The direction of the air movement with respect to blade rotation is
     determined by the pitch - the tilt - of the blades. Although reversing
     air direction is possible by reversing the motor, one direction is
     usually more effective than the other due to the curve of the blades.

  2. Centrifugal blowers. These use a structure that looks similar to a
     squirrel cage to suck air from the center and direct it out a plenum
     formed around the blower. While these may be found in all sizes, the
     most common household application is in the vacuum cleaner. Large
     versions of these blowers are used in central heating and
     airconditioning systems, window airconditioners, and oil burners.

     Direction of rotation of the blower motor does not change the direction
     of airflow. However, one direction will be more effective than the other
     (where the blower is rotating in the same direction as the way exit port
     on the air plenum points. Because of this, it is not possible for a
     vacuum cleaner to blow out the suction hose due to a reversed motor
     (which in itself is for all intents and purposes, impossible as well).
     This is usually caused by back flow due to a blockage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.20 "Bearings and bushings"

The shafts of rotating parts normally are mounted in such a way that friction
is minimized - to the extent needed for the application. A bearing is any
such joint with more specific terms used to describe the typical types found
in small appliances - or lawnmower, automobile engines, or 100 MW turbines.

Plain bearings - these consist of an outer sleeve called a bushing in which a
polished shaft rotates. The bushing may be made of a metal like brass or
bronze or a plastic material like teflon. The shaft is usually made of steel
though other materials may be found depending on the particular needs. Where
a metal bushing is used, there must be means provided for lubrication. This
may take the form of oiling grooves or holes and an oil reservoir (usually a
saturated wad of felt) or the bushing itself may be sintered. Metal particles
are compressed at high temperature and pressure resulting in a very porous
but strong material which retains the lubricating oil.

Under normal conditions, a plain bearing wears only during start and stop
cycles. While the shaft is rotating at any reasonable speed, there is no
metal to metal contact and thus no wear. With a properly designed and
maintained bearing of this type, a very thin oil film entirely supports the
shaft - thus the importance of clean oil. Your automobile engine's crankshaft
is entirely supported by these types of bearings.

The plain bearings in small appliances must be lubricated using a proper
electric motor or machine oil - not automotive engine oil and NEVER NEVER
WD40. Eventually, even 'lubricated for life' bearings of this type may need
to be disassembled, cleaned, and lubricated.

Frictionless bearings are usually of the ball or roller variety. An inner
ring called a race rotates supported by a series of balls or rollers inside
an outer race. There is virtually no friction even at stand-still with these
bearings. However, rolling metal to metal contact is maintained at all speeds
so they are not quite as wear free as a properly maintained and constantly
rotating plain bearing. However, for all practical purposes in small
appliances, these will last a long time and are rarely a problem.

Sometimes, reworking an appliance to use a ball bearing instead of a plain
bearing is a worthwhile effort - I have done this with electric drills and
shop vacs. They run smoother and quieter with ball bearings. Not
surprisingly, higher-end models of these devices (which use ball bearings)
share parts with the cheaper versions and finding standard ball bearings that
would fit was not difficult.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1.21 "Mechanical controllers - timing motors and cam switches"

While these are not that common on small appliances, they may be present in
washing machines, dryers, dishwashers. and refrigerator defrost timers. They
in themselves may be considered small appliances - and often can be repaired
or replaced easily.

Most of these are just small timing motors (synchronous motors running off of
the AC line) which rotate one or more cams (disks with bumps) which activated
one or more switches at appropriate times during the rotation cycle. Typical
cycle times range from a minute or less to several hours (refrigerator
defrost timer). Most like washing machine timers are in the 1 hour range.
Sometimes, the motor is stopped during certain portions of the cycle awaiting
completion of some other operation (i.e., fill).

These controllers therefore consist of several parts:

   o Timing motor. A very small synchronous AC line operated motor with an
     integral gear train is most common. Sometimes, the rotor and geartrain
     are in a sealed, easily replaceable unit - a little metal case that
     clamps within the pole pieces of the AC field magnet. In other cases, it
     is a separate motor assembly or an integral part of the overall timer
     mechanism.

   o Escapement (not present on all types). This is a device which converts
     the continuous rotation of the timing motor to a rapid movement for each
     incremental cam position. A common type is a movement every 45 seconds
     to the next position. This assures that the make or break action of the
     switches is rapid minimizing arcing.

   o Cam(s). One or more cams made of fiber composite, plastic, or metal, are
     rotated on a common shaft. There will be one set of switch contacts for
     each circuit that needs to be controlled.

   o Switches. These will either be exposed sets of contacts or enclosed
     'microswitches' which are operated by the cams.

Testing: If the controller is not working at all, check for power to the
motor. Listen for the sound of the motor parts rotating. Check for gummed up
lubrication or broken parts.

If some of the circuits do not work, check the switches for dirty or worn
contacts or broken parts.

@node 6.1.22 "Electronic controllers - simple delay or microprocessor based"

These can range from a simple R-C (resistance-capacitance) circuit to provide
the time delay in a toaster to sophisticated microprocessor based systems for
programming of a coffee maker or microwave oven.

While generally quite reliable, bad solder connections are always a
possibility as well as failed parts due to operation in an environment prone
to temperature extremes.

Testing: check for bad solder connections and connectors that need to be
cleaned and reseated. Inspect for obviously broken or burned parts. Test
components for proper value.

For digital clock/programmers or microprocessor based controllers, not much
else can be done without a schematic - which not likely to be easily
available.

@node 6.1.23 "Batteries - Alkaline, Lithium, Nickel-Cadmium, Lead-acid"

More and more small appliances and power tools are cutting their cords and
going to battery power. Although there are a large number of battery types,
the most common for power applications (as opposed to hearing aids, for
example) are:

   o Alkaline - primary (non-rechargeable, for the most part), long shelf
     life, high energy density.

   o Lithium - primary and secondary (rechargeable) available though most
     appliance applications (which are just beginning to develop) are not
     rechargeable. Long shelf life, very high energy density. Still quite
     expensive.

   o Nickel Cadmium - most common rechargeable technology in cordless
     appliances and power tools. However, relatively fast self discharge and
     on about half the capacity of a similar sized Alkaline.

   o Lead-Acid - secondary type similar to the battery in your automobile but
     packaged in a totally sealed container which is virtually indestructible
     and leakproof. Medium self discharge rate but will deteriorate if left
     discharged for an extended period of time.

@node 6.1.24 "AC adapters and chargers - wall 'warts' with AC or DC outputs"

These wall adapters are used to power many small electronic devices and
appliances directly and/or to recharge their batteries. They usually plug
directly into the wall socket and convert the 115 VAC (U.S.) to a lower
voltage - 3 V to 24 V AC or DC typical. More sophisticated units may actually
be a switching power supply with smart electronic control of battery charging
and power management. The following are typical types:

   o AC output - 3 to 24 VAC (or more) at 50 mA to 3 A. The only internal
     component is a power transformer which may include a thermal or ordinary
     fuse for protection.

   o DC output - 3 to 24 VDC (or more, under load) at 50 mA to 1.5 A. In
     addition to the power transformer, there is a rectifier, filter
     capacitor, and possibly a three terminal IC regulator (not that common).
     Some type of protection will probably be built in as well.

   o Universal/switching power supply - typically 6 to 18 VDC at .5 to 3 A.
     These will usually operate off of any voltage input from 90 to 240 VAC
     (or DC) and provide a well regulator output. There will generally be an
     internal fuse as well as overvoltage and overcurrent protection.

In some cases, a single adapter will put out multiple voltages. See the
chapter: @{"AC Adapters" link "9"} for more information.

@endnode
@node 7.1 "Table lamps"

This is the most popular type of lighting for reading or general
illumination. The type described in this section takes normal 115 VAC light
bulbs.

The common table lamp is just a light duty cordset, switch, and sockets for
one or more incandescent light bulbs. In many cases, the switch and socket
are combined into one assembly. In other designs, particularly where more
than one bulb can be lit independently (for example, a large bulb up top and
a night light in the base), a separate switch (rotary or push-push) selects
the light bulb(s) to be turned on.

For the most common combined switch and socket, there are several varieties
and these are all generally interchangeable. Therefore, if you want to take
advantage of the added convenience of a 3-way bulb allowing low, medium, and
high illumination, it is a simple matter to replace the simple on-off switch
in your lamp with a 3-way switch (not to be confused with the 3-way switches
used in house wiring to control a single light fixture from 2 places).

Push-push, pull chain, and rotary switches are common for simple on-off
control. The 3-way switches are usually of the rotary variety with
off-low-medium-high selected as the knob is rotated. The 3-way bulb has two
filaments which can be switched on individually or in combination to provide
the 3 levels of illumination.

Dimmer sockets can often be substituted for the normal kind as long as
conventional incandescent bulbs (and not compact fluorescents) are to be
used.

Touch and even sound activated switch-sockets are also available though my
personal recommendation is to stay away from them.

Most common problems: burned out bulb, worn switch, bad plug or cord. Where
the light flickers, particularly if jiggling or tapping on the switch has an
effect, a bad switch is almost always the problem. Switch failure is more
common when using high wattage bulbs but can occur just due to normal wear
and tear.

Replacements for most common switches and sockets are readily available at
large hardware stores, home centers, and electrical supply houses. It is best
to take along the old switch so that an exact match (if desired) can be
obtained. While the thread sizes for the screw on socket shells are quite
standard, some older lamps may have an unusual size. For more complicated
switches with multiple sockets, label or otherwise record the wiring. If
color coded, cut the wires so that the colors are retained at both the lamp
and switch ends.

@node 7.1.1 "Rebuilding a basic table lamp"

As noted in the Introduction, virtually any table lamp can be restored to
like-new electrical condition for a few dollars at most. The following is the
detailed procedure for the majority of common table lamps found in the U.S.

This is assumed to be the type of lamp which has a combination socket and
switch with a metal (brass-colored usually) outer shell. It is your decision
as to whether a simple on-off switch or a 3-way type is to be used - they are
usually interchangeable and a normal light bulb can be put into a 3-way
socket (two clicks of the knob will be needed to switch a normal light bulb
on or off, however). You can also put a 3-way bulb into a normal socket but
you will, of course, only get one level of illumination (medium).

You will need: (1) a new socket/switch of the appropriate type and (2) a new
cordset (if you want to replace this as well). A polarized type plug is
desirable to mimize the possibility of shock when changing bulbs. A medium
size straight blade screwdriver and wire strippers are the only required
tools.

First, remove and set aside any shade, frosted chimney, and other cosmetic
attachments.

Unplug the lamp!!!

Examining the metal shell, you will note that it is in two pieces. If you
look carefully, there will probably be indications of where firmly pressing
the top portion will allow it to be separated from the bottom part mounted on
the lamp. These are usually near where the knob, button, or chain, enters the
switch. Sometimes, a fine screwdriver blade will be useful to gently pry the
two halves apart.

With the top part removed, unscrew and disconnect two wires and remove the
switch. If desired, loosen the set screw (if any) and unscrew the bottom
portion of the shell. If you are simply replacing the switch, at this point
you would just attach the new one and reassemble in reverse order. Screw on
the bottom of the new switch enough so that it is either tight or until the
threads are fully engaged but not pressing on or protruding above the
cardboard insulating disk in the bottom half of the shell. If the entire
assembly is still loose, it should be possible to tighten hardware on the
bottom of the lamp to secure it against rotation. NOTE: it is important to do
this to avoid eventual damage to the wires should the switch move around
significantly during normal use.

To replace the cordset, you may need to partially remove any felt pad that
may be glued to the base of the lamp. Sometimes, it is possible to cut off
the old plug, attach the new cord to the end of these wires, and pull it
through. However, in most cases, there will be a knot or other strain relief
in the original cord which will make this impossible (and you will want to
replicate this in the replacement as well). Therefore, if needed, carefully
peel back the felt pad only enough to gain access to the interior. In some
cases, just cutting a small X in the center will allow sufficient access and
this can be easily patched with a piece of cloth tape.

Install the new cord in exactly the same way as the original with a knot for
a strain relief if needed. If there was no strain relief to begin with,
adding a knot is a good idea if there is space for one in the base. Snake the
cord through to the top of the lamp.

Strip the ends of the wires to a length of about 1/2 inch and twist the
strands tightly together in a clockwise direction. If you are using a cordset
with a polarized plug, identify the wire attached to the wide prong (with a
continuity checker or ohmmeter if it is not clearly marked by a stripe on the
insulation) and connect it to the silver colored screw. Connect the wire
attached to the narrow prong to the brass colored screw. Always wrap in a
clockwise direction. See the section: @{"Attaching wires to screw terminals" link "5.9"}

Confirm that there are no loose wire strands and that the insulation is
nearly flush with the screw to avoid possible shorts. Pop the shell top WITH
its insulating cardboard sleeve over the switch and press firmly onto the
base. There should be a very distinct click as it locks in place.

If needed, adjust the strain relief at the base of the lamp so that pulling
on the cord does not apply any tension to the wires attached to the switch.
Tighten the nut in the base of the lamp holding the entire assembly in place
if the socket is still loose and rotates easily. Don't overdo it - the
supporting structure is often just a glass jar or something similar. Put a
drop of Loctite, nail polish, Duco cement, or something similar - or a second
nut - on the threads to prevent the nut from loosening. Use some household
cement to reattach the felt pad you peeled back earlier.

@node 7.2 "Specialty lamps"

These include several types but they all use a transformer to reduce the 115
VAC to something lower like 12-24 V.

Tensor(tm) (and their clones) high intensity lamps have been around for over
30 years and are essentially unchanged today. They use a low voltage
transformer producing 12-24 VAC along with a special high output light bulb
that looks similar to an automotive tail light. However, it uses
substantially more current for the same voltage and puts out a much more
intense, whiter light. These are not halogen lamps though their spectral
characteristics are similar since the filaments run hotter than normal
incandescents - and have shorter lives.

Some will have multiple levels of illumination based on selecting taps on the
transformer. Normal dimmers may not work (and should not be used) with these
due to their transformer design - damage to the dimmer or lamp may result and
this may be a fire hazard.

Problems with Tensor lamps tend to center around the socket and switch. These
may fail due to overheating as a result of the high temperature and high
current operation. Replacements are available but they may take some effort
to locate. A replacement lamp may be cheaper. (I often find complete Tensor
lamps in perfect operating condition at garage sales for around $2.

Halogen lamps share many of the design characteristics of Tensor lamps in
that they are designed for local high intensity lighting and use a
transformer usually (though some may use solid state voltage conversion
instead). While some halogen lamps come with dimmers, some of the advantages
of the halogen cycle are lost if the bulbs are not run at full power. The
worst case is where they are operated just below full power - too cool for
the halogen cycle to take place but hot enough for substantial filament
evaporation to occur.

CAUTION: halogen bulbs run extremely hot and are a serious fire hazard and
burn hazard if not properly enclosed. When changing a halogen bulb, wait
ample time for the old one to cool or use an insulated non-flammable glove or
pad to remove it. When installing the new bulb, make sure power is off, and
do not touch it with your fingers - use a clean cloth or fresh paper towel.
If you do accidentally touch it, clean with alcohol. Otherwise, finger oils
may etch the quartz and result in early - possibly explosive failure - due to
weakening of the quartz envelope.

@endnode
@node 7.3 "Incandescent fixtures"

A fixture is normally permanently mounted to a wall or ceiling. However,
aside from not usually having a plug - being directly wired - they are
similar to table lamps in what is inside.

There will be one or more sockets for light bulbs - often all wired in
parallel so that all the bulbs come on at the same time. For wall fixtures,
there may be a switch on the fixture though most often the switch is mounted
on the wall elsewhere.

Unlike table lamps where most of the heat rises from the bulb away from the
socket, mounting the sockets horizontally or inverted (base up) can result in
substantial heating and eventual deterioration of the socket and wiring.
Common problems relate to this type of problem - bad connections or brittle
wire insulation. Replacement parts are generally available at home centers
and electrical supply houses. Just make sure to kill power before working on
any fixture wired into your house's electrical system!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.4 "Dimmer switches"

In the old days, a dimmer was a large high wattage reostat put in series with
the light bulb. These were both inefficient and producers of a lot of heat.
Modern dimmers use a device called a thyristor which is a solid state switch
to control illumination by turning the light bulb on for only a part of each
AC cycle as determined by the adjustment knob.

Dimmers are available to replace standard wall switches and even for use in
place of the light bulb socket/switch in most table lamps. However, nearly
all of these are designed only for normal incandescent light bulbs - not
fluorescents, compact fluorescents, or high intensity or halogen lamps (or
any other type of lamp with a transformer).

(There are special dimmers for use with fluorescent lamps but these must be
specifically matched to the lamp type and wattage and their dimming range is
usually not very wide. A discussion of these is beyond the scope of this
document.)

Installation is generally very straightforward as there are only two wires
and polarity does not matter. They simply replace the existing switch.

Dimmers may fail due to power surges, excess load, momentary fault (short) at
the instant of light bulb failure, or just plain old age. A failed dimmer
will generally be stuck at full brightness since the thyristor will have
shorted out. The mechanical on-off switch which is part of the dimmer will
probably still work.

   o A power surge may result in a failed dimmer just like any other solid
     state device.

   o Make sure you are nor overloading the circuit controlled by the dimmer.
     Most common types are rated for 600 W maximum with heavy duty types up
     to 1200 W or more. My advice is to not load them to more than 60-75% of
     their rating.

   o When light bulbs burn out, there can be an instantaneous spike of high
     current due to the failure mechanism. This may blow a fuse or trip a
     circuit breaker - but it may also blow out a dimmer control.

   o Dimmers are not always of the highest quality design or construction and
     parts may run hot - ever touch the wall plate of a dimmer running at 50%
     power? Long term reliability may not be that great.

It is not generally worth worrying about repair of a dimmer as they are so
inexpensive. However, before replacement confirm that there is no problem
with the wiring and that you are not overloading the dimmer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.4.1 "Can I use a dimmer to control transformer operated low voltage lighting?"

It is very tempting to try using a common light dimmer to control devices
using power transformers. Will this work?

There really is no definitive answer. It is generally not recommended but
that doesn't mean it won't work perfectly safely in many instances.

However, in principle this may be dependent on what is on the secondary side
- a transformer appears more inductive when it is lightly loaded - and on the
design of your particular dimmer.

It could blow the dimmer or result in the dimmer simply getting stuck at full
power for some or all of the control range since the inductive load will
cause the current to continue flowing even after the voltage has gone to zero
and the thyristor should shut off. If it works reliably in your situations,
then this is not a problem. Again, it may be load dependent.

It probably will result in more audible noise from the transformer but this
is probably harmless except to your sanity.

The only safety issues I can think of and these relate to the transformer
running hotter than normal as a result of core saturation. This might happen
at certain settings if the thyristor is not switching at the same point on
the positive and negative half cycles. There would be a net DC current flow
through the transformer which is not good, If the thyristor were to fail in
such a way that it only triggered on one half cycle, very large DC current
could flow. However, a suitably rated fuse or circuit breaker and thermal
cutout should handle both these situations.

NOTE: If your dimmer uses an SCR instead of a triac, this will result in
immediate and catastrophic failure. An SCR results in a DC output. However,
full range dimmers usually use triacs.

The bottom line: I can NOT provide any guarantees.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.5 "Flashlights and lanterns"

Battery operated flashlights (torches for those on the other side of the
Lake) and lanterns are among the simplest of appliances. We probably all have
a box or drawer full of dead flashlights.

The most common problem after dead batteries is very often damage due to
leaky batteries. Even supposedly leak-proof batteries can leak. Batteries
also tend to be prone to leaking if they are weak or dead. Therefore, it is
always a good idea to remove batteries from any device if it is not to be
used for a while. How to assure the batteries will be with the flashlight?
Put them in separate plastic bags closed and fastened with a twist tie.

Test the batteries with a multimeter - fresh Alkalines should measure 1.57 V.
Anything below 1.2 V or so should be replaced as they will let you down in
the end. On a battery tester, they should read well into the green region.

Check the bulb with a multimeter on the ohms scale - a bad bulb will test
open. Bulbs may fail from use just like any other incandescent lamp or from a
mechanical shock - particularly when lit and hot. Replacement bulbs must be
exactly matched to the number and type of batteries (cells). A type number is
usually stamped on the bulb itself. There are special halogen flashlight
bulbs as well - I do not really know how much benefit they provide.

The switches on cheap flashlights are, well, cheaply made and prone to
unreliable operation or total failure. Sometimes, bending the moving metal
strip a bit so it makes better contact will help.

Clean the various contacts with fine sandpaper or a nail file.

If a flashlight has been damaged as a result of battery leakage, repair may
be virtually impossible.

High quality flashlights are another matter. Maglights(tm) and similar units
with machined casings and proper switches should last a long time but the
same comments apply to batteries - store them separately to avoid the
possibility of damage from leakage. Keep a spare bulb with each of these -
the specialty bulbs may be harder to find than those for common garbage -
sorry - flashlights.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.6 "Makeup mirrors"

There are a simple movable mirror with incandescent or fluorescent lighting
built in.

Replacing incandescent light bulbs can usually be done without disassembly.
The bulbs may be of the specialty variety and expensive, however.

When a unit using fluorescent bulbs will no longer come on, the most likely
cause is a bad bulb. However, replacement may involve disassembly to fain
access. Where two bulbs are used, either one or both might be bad. Sometimes
it will be obvious which is bad - one or both ends might be blackened. If
this is not the case, replacement or substitution is the only sure test.
These WILL be expensive $7-10 is not uncommon for an 8 inch fluorescent bulb!

Other possible problems: plug, cord, switch, light bulb sockets.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.7 "Chandeliers"

A chandelier is simply an incandescent light fixture with multiple sockets.
No matter how fancy and expensive, the wiring is usually very simple - all
the sockets are connected in parallel to a cord which passes through the
chain to a ceiling mounted electrical box.

If none of the lights come on, check for a blown fuse or circuit breaker, bad
wall switch or dimmer, a bad connection in the ceiling box or elsewhere in
the house wiring, or a bad connection where the cord is joined to the
individual socket wires.

Where only one bulb does not light - and it is not a burned out bulb - a bad
socket, loose wire connection at the socket, or bad connection at the point
where the wires are joined (Wire Nuts(tm) or crimps) is likely.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.8 "Portable fans and blowers"

These consist of a cordset, switch, and AC motor. Oscillating fans add a
gearbox to automatically swivel the fan to direct air in more than one
direction. Most are of the bladed variety though some small types might use a
squirrel cage type centrifugal blower.

There are two kinds of problems: totally dead or stuck/sluggish.

A totally dead fan can be the result of several possible causes:

   o Bad cord or plug - these get abused. Test or substitute.

   o Bad power switch - bypass it and see if the fan starts working or test
     with a continuity checker or multimeter. Sometimes, just jiggling it
     will confirm this by causing the fan to go on and off.

   o Open thermal fuse in motor - overheating due to tight bearings or a
     motor problem may have blown this. Inspect around motor windings for
     buried thermal fuse and test with continuity checker or multimeter.
     Replacement are available. For testing, this can be bypassed with care
     to see if the motor comes alive.

   o Burned out motor - test across motor with a multimeter on the low ohms
     scale. The resistance should be a few Ohms. If over 1K, there is a break
     in the motor winding or an open thermal fuse. If there is no fuse or the
     fuse is good, then the motor may be bad. Carefully inspect for fine
     broken wires near the terminals as these can be repaired. Otherwise, a
     new motor will be needed. If the motor smells bad, no further
     investigation may be necessary!

   o Bad wiring - check for broken wires and bad connections.

As always, your continuity checker or multimeter on the low ohms scale is
your best friend and can be used to trace the wiring from the wall plug
through all components of the appliance.

Sluggish operation can be due to gummed up lubrication in the motor or any
gears associated with an automatic oscillating mechanism. Disassemble,
thoroughly clean, and then lubricate the motor bearings with electric motor
oil. Use light grease for the gearbox but this is rarely a problem.

A noisy fan may be due to dry motor or other bearings or loose hardware or
sheetmetal. Disassemble, clean, and lubricate the motor or gearbox as above.
Inspect for loose covers or other vibrating parts - tighten screws and/or
wedge bits of wood or plastic into strategic locations to quiet them down.

Damaged fan blades will result in excessive vibration and noise. These may be
easily replaceable. They will be attached to the motor shaft with either a
large plastic 'nut' or a setscrew. However, locating a suitable set of blades
may be difficult as many cheap fans are not made by well known companies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.9 "Air cleaners"

Simple air cleaners are just a motor driven fan and a foam or other filter
material. Failure of the fan to operate can be a result of any of the causes
listed above in the section: @{"Fans and Blowers" link "6.1.19"}

For electronic air cleaners, a failure of the solid state high voltage
generator can result in the unit blowing air but not removing dust and
particulate matter as it should. The repair of the electronics is beyond the
scope of this document.

@endnode
@node 7.10 "Ceiling fans"

While the original slow rotating ceiling mounted fan predates the widespread
use of airconditioning, there is a lot to be said for the efficiency,
effectiveness, and silence of this technology - not to mention the ambiance.

A ceiling fan is just an induction motor driving a set of blades. Multiple
taps on the motor windings in conjunction with a selector switch provides
speed control for most inexpensive fans. Better units include a solid state
motor speed control.

The light often included with the fan unit is usually just an incandescent
fixture with 1-5 bulbs and a switch. This may be a simple on-off type, a
selector to turn on various combinations of bulbs, or a dimmer with
continuous or discrete control of illumination.

WARNING: Always check mechanical integrity of fan mounting when installing or
servicing a ceiling fan. Original design and construction is not always as
fail-safe as one might assume. Double check for loose nuts or other hardware,
adequate number of threads holding fan to mounting, etc. These have fallen
without warning. Only mount in ceiling boxes firmly anchored to joists - not
just hanging from the ceiling drywall! Check that the fan is tight
periodically. The constant vibration when running, slight as it is, can
gradually loosen the mounting hardware. Furthermore, if pull chain type
switches are used for the fan or light, constant tugging can also tend to
loosen the entire fan.

Failures of ceiling fans can be divided into electrical and mechanical:

  1. Electrical:

      o No power - Use a circuit tester to determine if power is reaching the
        fan. Check the fuse or circuit breaker, wall switch if any, and wire
        connections in ceiling box.

      o Bad switch in fan - with power off, check with a continuity tester.
        If wiring is obvious, bypass the switch and see if the fan comes
        alive. Jiggle the switch with power on to see if it is intermittent.
        For multispeed fans, exact replacements may be required. For single
        speed fans, switches should be readily available at hardware stores,
        home centers, or electrical supply houses.

      o Bad motor - if all speeds are dead, this would imply a bad connection
        or burned winding common to all speeds. There might be an open
        thermal fuse - examine in and around the motor windings. A charred
        smelly motor may not require further testing. A partially shorted
        motor may blow a fuse or trip a circuit breaker as well or result in
        a loud hum and no or slow operation as well.

  2. Mechanical:

      o Noise and/or vibration - check that fan blades are tight and that any
        balance weights have not fallen off. Check for worn or dry bearings.
        Check for sheetmetal parts that is loose or vibrating against other
        parts. Tighten screws and/or wedge bits of plastic or wood into
        strategic spots to quiet it down. However, this may be a symptom of
        an unbalanced fan, loose fan blade, or electrical problems as well.
        Check that no part of the rotating blade assembly is scraping due to
        a loose or dislodged mounting.

      o Sluggish operation - blades should turn perfectly freely with power
        off. If this is not the case, the bearings are gummed up or otherwise
        defective. Something may be loose and contacting the casing. (This
        would probably make a scraping noise as well, however).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.11 "Variable speed ceiling fan on normal circuit"

It is usually not possible to use a normal light dimmer to control the fan as
this uses an AC induction motor. A dimmer can only be used on the built in
light if a separate wire is available to power it.

For existing installations where rewiring is inconvenient, here is an
alternative:

(From: Rick & Andrea Lang (rglang@radix.net)).

Here's a potential solution if you don't mind spending a little more for a
ceiling fan (If you already have one in that location, perhaps you can put it
in another room). Ceiling fans with remote control are now available. They
only require power to the ceiling fan (2 wire) and a remote control. With the
remote you can dim the lights, slow the fan or both. You can then use the
existing new wall switch as a power ON/OFF switch also. If you choose this
route, be careful of interference with garage door openers. Usually, the
remotes have at least 4 frequency selections to help avoid interference with
other remote systems. I put one in that three of the four frequencies opened
the garage door. I lucked out on the 4th one!

@endnode
@node 7.12 "Appliance timers"

Most of these are simply a timing motor controlling a two prong (usually
polarized) outlet.

The most common problems relate to failure of the timing motor or gear train.
With time, the oil and grease used inside the timing motor may gum up.
Eventually, it gets so stiff that the motor stops - or more likely - doesn't
start up after a power failure or the unit has been unplugged for a while.

The cheap plastic gears may also break, chip, or loose teeth.

Sometimes, disassembly, cleaning, and lubrication, will get the motor going -
possibly for a long time. However, replacement parts are rarely worth the
cost compared to a complete new timer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.13 "Wall thermostats"

These can be divided into several classes depending on:

   o Normal or setback (electronic or electromechanical).
   o 24 VAC or self powered (thermopile or thermocouple) valve control.
   o Heating, airconditioning, or combination.

It is not possible to cover all variations as that would require a complete
text in itself. However, here is a summary of possible problems and
solutions.

Conventional thermostats usually use a bimetal strip or coil with a set of
exposed contacts or a mercury switch. In general, these are quite reliable
since the load (a relay) is small and wear due to electrical arcing is
negligible. On those with exposed contacts, dirt or a sliver of something can
prevent a proper connection so this is one thing to check if operation is
erratic. The following description assumes a single use system - heating or
cooling - using 24 VAC control which is not properly controlling the furnace
or airconditioner.

  1. Locate the switched terminals on the thermostat. Jumper across them to
     see if the furnace or airconditioner switches on. If it does, the
     problem is in the thermostat. If nothing happens, there may be a problem
     in the load or its control circuits. Cycle the temperature dial back and
     forth a few times to see if the contacts ever activate. You should be
     able to see the contacts open and close (exposed or mercury) as well.

     (CAUTION: on an airconditioner, rapid cycling is bad and may result in
     tripped breakers or overload protectors so ideally, this should be done
     with the compressor breaker off).

  2. Check for 24 VAC (most cases) across the switched circuit. If this is
     not present, locate the control transformer and determine if it is
     working - it is powered and its output is live - you may have the main
     power switch off or it may be on a circuit with a blown fuse or tripped
     breaker. I have seen cases where the heating system was on the same
     circuit as a sump pump and when this seized up, the fuse blew rendering
     the heating system inoperative. Needless to say, this is not a
     recommended wiring practice. The transformer may be bad if there is no
     output but it is powered. Remove its output connections just to make
     sure there is no short circuit and measure on the transformer again.

  3. If 24 VAC is present and jumpering across the terminals does nothing,
     the heater valve or relay or airconditioner relay may be bad or there is
     a problem elsewhere in the system.

  4. Where jumpering the terminals turns on the system, the thermostat
     contacts may be malfunctioning due to dirt, corrosion, wear, or a bad
     connection. For a setback unit, the setback mechanism may be defective.
     Test and/or replace any batteries and double check the programming as
     well. On those with motor driven timers operating off of AC, this power
     may be missing.

  5. Where jumpering the terminals does not activate the system, check the
     load. For a simple heating system, this will be a relay or valve. Try to
     listen for the click of the relay or valve. If there is none, its coil
     may be open though in this case there will be no voltage across the
     thermostat contacts but the 24 V transformer will be live. If you can
     locate the relay or valve itself, check its coil with an ohmmeter.

  6. If the previous tests are ok, there may be bad connections in the
     wiring.

Type of control - most systems use a 24 VAC circuit for control. However,
some use low voltage self powered circuits that require special compatible
(sometimes called thermopile or thermocouple) thermostats with low resistance
contacts and no electronics directly in series with the control wires.
Erratic or improper control may result from using the wrong type.

Setback thermostats - these may be controlled electromechanically by a timer
mechanism which alters the position of the contacts or selects an alternate
set. Newer models are fully electronic and anything beyond obvious bad
connections or wiring, or dead batteries is probably not easily repaired.
However, eliminate external problems first - some of these may need an
additional unswitched 24 VAC or 115 VAC to function and this might be
missing.

Heat anticipators - in order to reduce the temperature swings of the heated
space, there is usually a small heating element built into the thermostat
which provides some more immediate feedback to the sensor than would be
possible simply waiting for the furnace to heat the air or radiators. If this
coil is defective or its setting is misadjusted, then erratic or much wider
than normal temperature swings are possible. There will usually be
instructions for properly setting the heat anticipator with the thermostat or
furnace.

Units that control both heating and airconditioning are more complex and will
have additional switches and contacts but operate in a similar manner and are
subject to similar ailments.

@endnode
@node 7.14 "Electric space heaters"

All types have one thing in common - they are nearly 100% efficient which
means that just about every watt of power utilized is turned into heat. The
remainder is used for any built in fans or the wasted light produced by
glowing elements or quart lamps.

However, this does not mean that these are the most economical heating
devices. Heat pumps based on refrigeration technology can be much less costly
to run since they can have coefficients of performance - the ratio of heat
output to energy input - of 3 or more to 1. Thus, they are in effect, 300% or
more efficient. Note that this does not violate any conservation of energy
principles as these simply move heat from one place to another - the outdoors
is being cooled off at the same time.

Space heaters come in 3 common varieties:

   o Radiant - heating element with polished reflector.
   o Convection - heating element and small fan to circulate heated air.
   o Oil filled radiator - heating element heats oil and metal fins.

Problems with space heaters are nearly always related to bad heating
elements, problems with the thermostat, interlock switches, or fan (if any),
or bad connections. Blown fuses or tripped circuit breakers are very common
with these appliances as they are heavy loads - often the maximum that can
safely be plugged into a 15 A outlet - and thus overloads are practically
assured if ANYTHING else is used on the same circuit. Since we rarely keep
track of exactly what outlets are on any given circuit, accidentally using
other devices at the same time are likely since the same circuit may feed
outlets in more than one room - and sometimes some pretty unlikely places.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.14.1 "Radiant space heaters"

These use a coiled NiChrome, Calrod(tm), or quartz lamp heating element.
There is no fan. A polished reflector directs the infra red heat energy out
into the room. Radiant space heaters are good for spot heating of people or
things. They do not heat the air except by convection from the heated
surfaces.

Of course, first check that the outlet is live.

As with other heating appliances, the most likely problems are with burned
out heating elements; defective on/off switches, thermostats, or safety
interlock or tip-over switches, bad cord or plug, or bad wiring connections.
Your continuity checker or ohmmeter will quickly be able to identify which of
these are the problem.

WARNING: do not be tempted to bypass any interlock or tip-over switches
should they prove defective. They serve a very important fire and personal
safety function. Never, ever cover the heater in any way as a serious fire
hazard will result.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.14.2 "Convection space heaters"

A small fan blows air over or through a heating element. This may be a
NiChrome coil, Calrod(tm) element, or ceramic thermister. This type is
probably the most popular since it can quickly heat a small area. The ceramic
variety are considered safer than the others (of this type) since they are
supposed to operate at a lower surface temperature.

In addition to the problems covered in the section above: @{"Radiant space heaters" link "7.14.1"}
the fan can also become sluggish or seize up due to gummed up
lubrication (as well as other fan-motor problems). Since it is running in a
high temperature environment, disassembly, cleaning, and lubrication may be
needed periodically despite what the manufacturer may say about permanently
lubricated parts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.14.3 "Oil filled electric radiators"

These are also considered convection heaters but they do not have any fan.

The typical unit consists of a pair of heating elements providing 600, 900,
or 1500 Watts depending on which are switched on. A simple bimetal adjustable
thermostat is used for temperature control. The heating elements are fully
submerged and sealed inside an oil filled metal finned replica of an old
style radiator. The whole affair is mounted on wheels as it is quite heavy.

Common problems with these have been the pair of power switches which tend to
fail resulting in no or erratic operation. NOTE: if your heater is a Delongi,
there is a free (well $5 S&H) upgrade to replace the failure prone power
switches and thermostat on some common models.

The heating elements are not replaceable so if testing reveals an open
element, you will just not have that heat range. If an element shorts to the
case, it must be disconnected to prevent a shock hazard though the other one
can still be safely used. All other parts are readily available.

@node 7.14.4 "So, what about the Pelonus Disk furnace?"

(From: Kirk Kerekes (kkereke@iamerica.net)).

It is a portable electric heater, using high-power thermisters as the heating
elements. This technology was originally developed by TDK a few decades ago.
The premise is that the power thermisters will automatically control the
heating element temperature (the thermister), so that if the air flow is
blocked, the heater won't cook. The manufacturers make efficiency claims, but
these seem to be bogus.

I have a bathroom version of this device, and it works.

@node 7.15 "Electric pencil sharpeners"

AC powered pencil sharpeners consist of a small shaded pole induction motor,
pencil sense switch, and some gears and cutter wheels. Aside from pencil
shavings crudding up the works - which can be cleaned - the most common
failure is of the cheap plastic gears. These can be easily be replaced if you
can get them - the original manufacturer is likely the only source. The
switch contacts may become dirty or level/bar may become misaligned or worn.
Some clever repositioning or the addition of a shim may help in these cases.

Battery operated pencil sharpeners use a small DC motor for power. These tend
to be whimpier than their AC counterparts but all other comments apply.
Always try a fresh set of batteries first.

@node 7.16 "Blenders"

A blender really is just a high speed motor mounted inside a base. Units with
324 speeds accomplish (this more or less useless marketing gimmick) through a
combination of diodes, resistors, and multiple windings on the motor. Without
addressing the ultimate utility of thousands of speeds, problems with these
units are more likely to be in the motor itself - open or shorted windings,
or bad bearings. However, the selector switches and electrical parts can fail
as well.

The motors are typically of the series wound universal type. These have
carbon brushes which are prone to wear. However, given the relatively short
total usage of a blender, this is not usually a problem.

Disconnecting (and labeling!) connections one at a time may permit the source
of a problem to be localized. Diodes can be tested with a multimeter (they
should read open in one and only one direction) and resistors checked as
well.  Shorts in a motor with multiple taps on its windings may be difficult
to identify or locate. Shorted windings can result in overheating, incorrect
speeds, or even a blender that runs with the power switch supposedly in the
off position as the wiring is sometimes sort of strange!

Bad bearings will result in any number of mechanical problems including
excessive or spine tingling noise, vibration, a seized rotor or very sluggish
rotation. Sometimes, disassembly, cleaning, and oiling will be effective but
since these rotate at high speed, don't count on it. Unfortunately, cheap
bronze bushings are often used instead of ball bearings. However,
substituting a set from another similar unit might work since it is usually
the bronze bushing and not the motor shaft that fails.

The most sophisticated units will have a variable speed control - similar to
a light dimmer. If this goes bad - the blender always runs at full speed -
then the active element (triac) has probably blown. Replacement is possible
and the part types should be readily available.

@node 7.17 "Drip coffee makers"

A drip coffee maker consists of several components:

  1. A heating element - combined or separate Calrod(tm, usually) types for
     operating the drip pump and then keeping the coffee warm.

  2. Thermal protector - to prevent excess temperatures.

  3. Some kind of water interlock - prevents dripping when separate reservoir
     is used.

  4. Timer or controller. The simplest are mechanical while programmable
     units with clocks and electronic timers are also available.

Many problems are be mechanical - clogged water passages or interlock.

If there is no heating, check the element and thermal protector with an
ohmmeter. If the element is open, it is probably time for a new coffee maker.
The thermal protectors can be replaced but the underlying cause may be a
defective, shorted overheating element so it may not be worth the trouble.
Timers can develop bad contacts and bad connections are possible on
electronic controller circuit board wiring.

@endnode
@node 7.18 "Coffee percolators"

While largely replaced by the drip coffee maker, these are still available,
particularly in large sizes. The components are similar to those in a drip
coffee maker - element, thermal protector, possibly a thermostat as well. The
element and bottom of the water/coffee container are likely one piece to
provide the best thermal conduction for the 'pump' in the middle. Even if the
element is removable, it may not be worth the cost of replacement except for
a large expensive unit.

@node 7.20 "Electric (motor driven) clocks"

While line operated clocks have mostly been superseeded by electronic (LED or
LCD) clocks on nearly every kitchen appliance, many of these are still in
operation on older clock radios and ranges.

AC operated clocks depend on the AC line frequency (60 Hz or 50 Hz depending
on where you live) for time keeping. The accuracy of a line operated clock is
better than almost any quartz clock since the long term precision of the
power line frequency is a very carefully controlled parameter and ultimately
based on an atomic clock time standard.

Therefore, most problems are related to a clock motor that does not run or
will not start up following a power outage. Once running, these rarely fail.

The most common problems are either gummed up oil or grease inside the motor
and gear train, broken gears, or broken parts of the clock mechanism itself.
See the sections on @{"Synchronous timing motors" link "14.18"} and
@{"Disassembling and reassembling a small timing motor" link "14.19"} for repair info.

Battery operated quartz clocks usually operate on a 1.5 V Alkaline cell (do
not replace with NiCds as they do not have a long absolute life between
charges even if the current drain is small as it is with a clock).

First, test the battery. Use a multimeter - usually anything greater than 1 V
or so will power the clock though if it is closer to 1 V than 1.5 V, the
battery is near the end of its life. The clock may run slow or fast or
erratically on a low battery.

With a good battery, failure to run properly is usually mechanical - one of
the hands is hitting against the glass front or something like that. Don't
forget to check any on/off switch - these are not expected but are often
present presumably to permit you to start the clock at precisely the right
time. I had one case where the fine wire to the solenoid that operates the
once per second clock mechanism broke and had to be resoldered but this is
exceedingly rare.

If the clock consistently runs slow or fast with a known good battery, there
is usually a trimmer capacitor that can be adjusted with a fine jeweler's
straight blade screwdriver. Without test equipment the best you can do is
trial and error - mark its original position and turn it just a hair in one
direction. Wait a day or week and see if further adjustment is needed (right,
like you also won the lottery!) and fine tune it.

If the hands should fall off (what a thought!), they can usually be pressed
back in place. Then, the only trick is to line up the alarm hand with the
others so that the alarm will go off at the correct time. This can usually be
done easily by turning the hour hand counterclockwise using the setting knob
in the rear until it is not possible to turn it further. At this point, it is
lined up with the alarm hand. Install all hands at the 12:00 position and you
should be more or less all set.

@endnode
@node 7.23 "Electric carving knives"

A small motor operates a pair of reciprocating mounts for the blades.

AC powered carving knives include a momentary power switch, small motor
(probably universal type), and some gearing. Congealed food goo as well as
normal lubrication problems are common. The power switch is often cheaply
made and prone to failure as well. The cord may be abused (hopefully not cut
or damaged by careless use of the knife!) and result in an intermittent
connection at one end or the other. For motor problems, see the appropriate
sections on universal motors. @{"Motors 101" link "14"}

For battery power knives, bad NiCds are a very likely possibility due to the
occasional use of this type of appliance. See the sections on @{"Batteries" link "10"} and

@node 7.25 "Portable and stationary food mixers"

These consist of a universal motor which usually features a continuously
variable speed control or a selection of 3 to 5 speeds, a gearbox to transfer
power to the counter-rotating beaters, and a power switch (which may be part
of the speed control).

Sluggish operation may be due to cookie dough embedded in the gearing. Fine
particles of flour often find their way into the gears - clean and lubricate.
There may be a specific relationship that needs to be maintained between the
two main beater gears - don't mess it up if you need to disassemble and
remove these gears or else the beaters may not lock in without hitting
one-another.

The speed control may be a (1) selector switch, (2) mechanical control on the
motor itself, or (3) totally electronic. Parts may be replaceable although,
for portables at least, a new mixer may make more sense.

For sluggish operation (non-mechanical), sparking, burnt smells, etc., see

@endnode
@node 7.26 "Food processors"

A powerful universal motor is coupled to interchangeable cutters of various
types. In most respects, food processors are similar to any other universal
motor driven appliance with one exception: There will be a safety interlock
switch to prevent operation unless the cover is on properly and secured. This
switch may go bad or its mechanical position adjustment may shift over time
resulting in difficulty in engaging power - or a totally dead unit.

As usual, cord and plug problems, bad bearings, burnt motor windings, and
broken parts are all possibilities.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.27 "Steam and dry irons"

Most modern irons (does anyone really use these anymore?) can be used dry or
with steam.

An iron consists of a sole plate with an integrated set of heating coils.

Steam irons will have a series of holes drilled in this plate along with a
steam chamber where a small amount of water is boiled to create steam. A
steam iron can be used dry by simply not filling its reservoir with water.
Those with a spray or 'shot of steam' feature provide a bypass to allow hot
water or steam to be applied directly to the article being ironed.

Over time, especially with hard water, mineral buildups will occur in the
various passages. If these become thick enough, problems may develop. In
addition, mineral particles can flake off and be deposited on the clothes.

A thermostat with a heat adjustment usually at the top front of the handle
regulates the heating element. This is usually a simple bimetal type but
access to the mechanism is often difficult.

Where an iron refuses to heat, check the cord, test the heating element for
continuity with your ohmmeter, and verify that the thermostat is closed.

An iron that heats but where the steam or spray features are missing, weak,
or erratic, probably has clogged passages. There are products available to
clear these.

Newer irons have electronic timeout controllers to shut the iron off
automatically if not used for certain amount of time as a safety feature.
Failure of these is not likely and beyond the scope of this manual in any
case.

When reassembling an iron, take particular care to avoid pinched or shorted
wires as the case is metal and there is water involved - thus a potential
shock hazard.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.28 "Toasters"

In addition to a fine heating element, there is a controller to determine the
length of time that the bread (or whatever) is heated. A solenoid or bimetal
trip mechanism is used to pop the bread up (but hopefully not totally out) of
the toaster then it is 'done' and turn off the heating element at the same
time.

Since most of these are so inexpensive, anything more serious than a broken
wire or plug is probably not worth repairing. The heating element may develop
a broken spot - particularly if something like a fork is carelessly used to
fish out an English muffin, for example. (At least unplug it if you try this
stunt - the parts may be electrically live, your fork is metal, you are
touching it!). They may just go bad on their own as well.

Being a high current appliance, the switch contacts take a beating and may
deteriorate or melt down. The constant heat may weaken various springs in
either the switch contact or pop-up mechanism as well. Sometimes, some
careful 'adjustment' will help.

Controllers may be thermal, timer based, or totally electronic. Except for
obvious problems like a bent bimetal element, repair is probably not worth it
other then as a challenge.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.29 "Toaster oven (broilers)"

I really liked the old original style GE toaster oven. It was very versatile
and convenient for baking and toasting. The newer types seem to have lost
some of these qualities. The pop open door and oven tray have apparently not
been retained in any modern models that I am aware of.

Modern toaster oven (broilers) use Calrod style elements - usually two above
and two below the food rack. Depending on mode, either just the top (top
brown/broil), just the bottom (oven), or both sets (toast) will be energized.
Each pair may be wired in series meaning that a failure of one will result in
both of the pair being dead. Very old units may use a coiled NiChrome element
inside a quartz tube.

Thermostats are usually of the bimetal strip variety with an adjustment knob.
A cam or two on the shaft may also control main power and select the broil
function in the extreme clockwise position.

There may be a mode switch (bake-off-broil) which may develop bad contacts or
may fuse into one position if it overheats. These are often standard types
and easily replaceable. Just label where each wire goes on the switch before
removing it to take to an appliance repair parts store.

Newer models may use an electronic timer for the toast function at least. I
assume it is not much more than something like an IC timer (555) operating
the trip solenoid. However, I have not had to deal with a broken one as yet.

Testing is relatively straightforward. Check the heating elements,
thermostat, mode switch,, cord, and plug. While replacements for heating
elements and thermostats are often available, removing the old one and wiring
the new one may not be straightforward - rivets may be used for fastening and
welds for the wire connections. You will have to drill the rivets with an
electric drill and replace them with nuts, bolts, and lockwashers. Crimp
splices or nuts and bolts can be used for the wiring. Take extra care in
reassembly to avoid any bare wires touching the metal cabinet or other parts
as well as insulation being cut by sharp sheetmetal parts. The high
temperature fiberglas or asbestos insulation is not very robust. In the end,
it may not be worth it with full featured toaster oven/broilers going for
$20-30 on sale.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.30 "Hot plates, waffle irons, broilers, deep friers, rice and slow cookers, woks"

These are all just a single or dual heating element, thermal protector (not
all will have one), and an adjustable (usually) thermostat. As usual, check
the cord and plug first, and then each of the other parts with an ohmmeter.

Where a NiChrome coil type heating element is used, a break will be obvious.
If it is very near one end, then removing the short section and connecting
the remainder directly to the terminal will probably be fine. See the
section: @{"Repairing broken heating elements" link "15.2"}

For appliances like waffle irons, burger makers, and similar types with two
hinged parts, a broken wire in or at the hinge is very common.

Note that since these operate at high temperatures, special fiberglas (it
used to be asbestos) insulated wiring is used. Replace with similar types.
Take extra care in reassembly to avoid shorted wires and minimize the
handling and movement of the asbestos or fiberglas insulated high temperature
wiring.

@node 7.31 "Sewing machine"

---------------

Both mechanical and electrical problems are possible. (NOTE: we are not going
to deal with fancy computerized equipment as this is probably better left to
a professional except for the more obvious problems like a bad cord or plug.)

I have a 1903 Singer foot-pumped sewing machine which we have since
electrified and still runs fine. A couple of drops of sewing machine or
electric motor every so often is all that is needed. They were really built
well back then.

Although the appearance of the internal mechanism may appear intimidating at
first, there really is not that much to it - a large pulley drives a shaft
that (probably) runs the length of the machine. A few gears and cams operate
the above (needle and thread) and below (feet and bobbin) deck mechanisms.
Under normal conditions, these should be pretty robust. (Getting the
adjustments right may be another story - refer to your users manual).
Sometimes if neglected, the oil may seriously gum up and require the sparing
use of a degreaser to loosen it up and remove before relubing.

If the motor spins but does not turn the main large pulley, the belt is
likely loose or worn. The motor will generally be mounted on a bracket which
will permit adjustment of the belt tension. The belt should be tight but some
deflection should still occur if you press it gently in the middle.

If the motor hums but nothing turns, confirm that the belt is not too tight
and/or that the main mechanisms isn't seized or overly stiff - if so, it will
need to be cleaned and lubrication (possibly requiring partial disassembly).

The electric motor is normally a small universal type on a variable speed
foot pedal (see the section: @{"Wiring a sewing machine speed control" link "7.32"} If the
motor does not work at all, bypass the foot pedal control to confirm that it
is a motor problem (it is often possibly to just plug the motor directly into
the AC outlet). Confirm that its shaft spins freely. All normal motor
problems apply - bad wiring, worn brushes, open or shorted windings, dirty
commutator. See the section: @{"Problems with universal motors" link "14.3"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.32 "Wiring a sewing machine speed control"

This assumes a basic sewing machine (nothing computer controlled) with a
normal universal series wound motor (115 VAC).

The common foot pedals are simply wirewound reostats (variable resistors)
which have an 'off' position when the pedal is released. They are simply
wired in series with the universal motor of the sewing machine (but not the
light) and can be left plugged in all the time (though my general
recommendation as with other appliances is to unplug when not in use.

While not as effective as a thyristor type speed controller, these simple
foot pedals are perfectly adequate for a sewing machine. There are also
fancier speed controls and using a standard light dimmer might work in some
cases. However, there are two problems that may prevent this: the sewing
machine motor is a very light load and it is a motor, which is not the same
as a light bulb - it has inductance. The dimmer may not work, may get stuck
at full speed, or may burn out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.33 "Shavers"

A variety of types of drive mechanisms are used in electric shavers:

  1. Vibrator (AC only) - these (used by Remington among others) consist of a
     moving armature in proximity to the pole pieces of an AC electromagnet.
     The mass and spring are designed so that at the power line frequency,
     the armature vibrates quite strongly and is linked to a set of blades
     that move back and forth beneath the grille.

     If dead, check for continuity of the plug, cord, switch, and coil. IF
     sluggish, clean thoroughly - hair dust is not a good lubricant. Sliding
     parts probably do not require lubrication but a drop of light oil should
     be used on any rotating bearing points.

     Note that since a resonance is involved, these types of shavers may not
     work well or at all on foreign power - 50 Hz instead of 60 Hz or vice
     versa.

  2. Universal motor (AC or DC) - very small versions of the common universal
     motors found in other appliances. A gear train and linkage convert the
     rotary motion to reciprocating motion for shavers with straight blades
     or to multiple rotary motion for rotary blade shavers. These may suffer
     from all of the afflictions of universal motors; bad cords, wires, and
     switches; and gummed up, clogged, or worn mechanical parts. Also see the
     sections on the appropriate type of @{"motor" link "14"}. Take care when probing or
     disassembling these motors - the wire is very fine any may be easily
     damaged - I ruined an armature of a motor of this type by poking where I
     should not have when it was running - ripped all the fine wires from the
     commutator right off.

  3. DC PM motor - often used in rechargeable shavers running of 2 or 3 NiCd
     cells. These may suffer from battery problems as well as motor and
     mechanical problems. One common type is the Norelco (and clone) rotary
     shaver. See the chapters on @{"Batteries" link "10"} and @{"AC Adapters" link "9"} as well as the
     sections on @{"Small permanent magnet DC motors" link "14.11"}

     A shaver that runs sluggishly may have a dead NiCd cell - put it on
     charge for the recommended time and then test each cell - you should
     measure at least 1.2 V. If a NiCd cell reads 0, it is shorted and should
     be replaced (though the usual recommendation is to replace all cells at
     the same time to avoid problems in the future).

     Note that in terms of rechargeable battery life, shavers are just about
     optimal as the battery is used until it is nearly drained and then
     immediately put on charge. The theoretical 500 to 1000 cycle NiCd life
     is usually achieved in shaver applications.

@endnode
@node 7.34 "Hand massagers"

These are simply motors with an off-axis (eccentric) weight or
electromagnetic vibrators. If the unit appears dead, check the plug, cord,
on/off switch, internal wiring, and motor for continuity. Confirm that the
mechanical parts turn or move freely.

Some have built in infra-red heat which may just be a set of small light
bulbs run at low voltage to provide mostly heat and little light (a filter
may screen out most of the light as well). Obviously, individual light bulbs
can go bad - if they are wired in series, this will render all of them inert.

@endnode
@node 7.35 "Hair dryers and blow dryers"

A heating element - usually of the NiChrome coil variety - is combined with a
multispeed centrifugal blower.

First determine if the problem is with the heat, air, or both.

For heat problems, check the element for breaks, the thermal protector or
overtemperature thermostat (usually mounted in the air discharge), the
connections to the selector switch, and associated wiring.

For air problems where the element glows but the fan does not run, check the
fan motor/bearings, connections to selector switch, and associated wiring.
Confirm that the blower wheel turns freely and is firmly attached to the
motor shaft. Check for anything that may be blocking free rotation if the
blower wheel does not turn freely. The motor may be of the induction,
universal, or PM DC type. For the last of these, a diode will be present to
convert the AC to DC and this might have failed. See the appropriate section
for problems with the type of motor you have. @{"Motors 101" link "14"}

@endnode
@node 7.36 "Curling irons"

These are just a sealed heating element, switch, and thermal protector

usually do not occur.

@endnode
@node 7.37 "VCR cassette rewinders"

Cassette rewinders typically consist of a low voltage motor powered from a
built in transformer or wall adapter, a belt, a couple of reels, and some
means of stopping the motor and popping the lid when the tape is fully
rewound.

Note that some designs are very hard on cassettes - yanking at the tape since
only increased tension is used to detect when the tape is at the end. These
may eventually stretch the tape or rip it from the reel. I don't really care
much for the use of tape rewinders as normal use of rewind and fast forward
is not a major cause of VCR problems. Sluggish or aborted REW and FF may
simply indicate an impending failure of the idler tire or idler clutch which
should be addressed before the VCR gets really hungry and eats your most
valuable and irreplaceable tape.

Problems with tape rewinders are usually related to a broken or stretched
belt or other broken parts. These units are built about as cheaply as
possible so failures should not be at all surprising. The drive motor can
suffer from any of the afflictions of similar inexpensive permanent magnet
motors found in consumer electronic equipment. See the sections on small DC
@{"motors" link "14"} A broken belt is very common since increased belt (and tape) tension
is used to switch the unit off (hopefully). Parts can pop off of their
mountings. Flimsy plastic parts can break.

Opening the case is usually the biggest challenge - screws or snaps may be
used. Test the motor and its power supply, inspect for broken or dislocated
parts, test the power switch, check and replace the belt if needed. That is
about it.

@node 7.38 "Vacuum cleaners, electric brooms. and line powered hand vacs"

Despite all the hype surrounding vacuum cleaner sales, there isn't much
difference in the basic principles of operation between a $50 and $1,500
model - and the cheaper one may actually work better.

A vacuum cleaner consists of:

  1. A cordset - broken wires or damaged plugs are probably the number one
     problem with vacuums as they tend to be dragged around by their tails!
     Therefore, in the case of an apparently dead machine, check this first -
     even just squeezing and bending the wire may produce an instant of
     operation - enough to verify the cause of the problem.

  2. A power switch - this may be a simple on/off toggle which can be tested
     with a continuity checker or ohmmeter. However, fancy machines with
     powered attachments may have interlocks or switches on the attachments
     that cal also fail. Where multiple attachment options are present, do
     your initial troubleshooting with the minimal set as this will eliminate
     potential sources of additional interlock or switch complications. With
     'microprocessor' or 'computer' controlled vacuum cleaners, the most
     likely problems are not the electronics.

  3. A high speed universal motor attached to a centrifugal blower wheel. As
     with any universal motor, a variety of problems are possible: dirt
     (especially with a vacuum cleaner!), lubrication, brushes (carbon), open
     or shorted windings, or bad connections. See the section:
     @{"Problems with universal motors" link "14.3"}

  4. A belt driven carpet brush (uprights). The most common mechanical
     problem with these is a broken rubber belt. (One person who shall remain
     nameless, mistook the end of the broken belt for the tail of a mouse and
     promptly went into hysterics!). Replacements for these belts are readily
     available.

  5. Power nozzles and other powered attachments. Some of these are an
     attempt to give canester type vacuum cleaners the power of an upright
     with its directly powered carpet brush. Generally, these include a much
     smaller motor dedicated to rotating a brush. Electrical connections are
     either made automatically when the attachment is inserted or on a
     separate cable. Bad connections, broken belt, or a bad motor are always
     possibilities.

  6. A bag to collect dirt. Vacuum cleaners usually do a poor job of dust
     control despite what the vacuum cleaner companies would have you
     believe. Claims with respect to alergies and other medical conditions
     are generally without any merit unless the machine is specifically
     designed (and probably very expensive) with thes conditions in mind. If
     the vacuum runs but with poor suction, first try replacing the bag.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.38.1 "Vacuum cleaner mechanical problems"

  1. Poor suction - check the dirt bag and replace if more than half full.
     Check for obstructions - wads of dirt, carpet fibers, newspapers, paper
     towels, etc.

  2. Poor pickup on floors - broken or worn carpet brush belt. There should
     be some resistance when turning the carpet brush by hand as you are also
     rotating the main motor shaft. If there is none, the belt has broken and
     fallen off. Replacements are readily available. Take the old one and the
     model number of the vacuum to the store with you as many models use
     somewhat similar but not identical belts and they are generally not
     interchangeable. To replace the belt on most uprights only requires the
     popping of a couple of retainers and then removing one end of the carpet
     brush to slip the new belt on.

  3. Vacuum blows instead of sucks - first confirm that the hose is connected
     to the proper port - some vacuums have easily confused suction and blow
     connections. Next, check for internal obstructions such as wads of dirt,
     balls of newspaper, or other items that may have been sucked into the
     machine. Note that it is very unlikely - bordering on the impossible -
     for the motor to have failed in such a way as to be turning in the wrong
     direction (as you might suspect). Furthermore, even if it did, due to
     the design of the centrifugal blower, it would still suck and not blow.

     appliance repair parts distributors and vacuum/sewing machine repair

@node 7.38.2 "Vacuum cleaner electrical problems"

  1. Bad cord or plug - number one electrical problem due to the abuse that
     these endure. Vacuum cleaners are often dragged around and even up and
     down stairs by their tails. Not surprisingly, the wires inside
     eventually break. Test with a continuity checker or ohmmeter. Squeezing
     or bending the cord at the plug or vacuum end may permit a momentary
     spurt of operation (do this with it plugged in and turned on) to confirm
     this diagnosis.

  2. Bad power switch - unplug the vacuum and test with a continuity checker
     or ohmmeter. If jiggling the switch results in erratic operation, a new
     one will be required as well.

  3. Bad interlocks or sensors - some high tech vacuum cleaners have air flow
     and bag filled sensors which may go bad or get bent or damaged. Some of
     these can be tested easily with an ohmmeter but the newest computer
     controlled vacuum cleaners may be more appropriate to be repaired by a
     computer technician!

  4. Bad motor - not as common as one might thing. However, worn carbon
     brushes or dirt wedged in and preventing proper contact is possible. See
     the section: @{"Problems with universal motors" link "14.3"}

  5. Bad internal wiring - not likely but always a possibility.

Dust busters (tm) and other battery powered hand vacs These relatively low
suction battery powered hand vacuums have caught on due to their convenience
- certainly not their stellar cleaning ability!

A NiCd battery pack powers a small DC permanent magnet motor and centrifugal
blower. A simple momentary pushbutton power switch provides convenient on/off
control.

Aside from obvious dirt or liquid getting inside, the most common problems
occur with respect to the battery pack. If left unused and unplugged for a
long time, individual NiCd cells may fail shorted and not take or hold a
charge when the adapter is not plugged back into the wall socket. Sluggish
operation is often due to a single NiCd cell failing in this way.

@node 7.40 "Heating pads"

Heating pads are simply a very fine wire heating element covered in thick
insulation and then sealed inside a waterproof flexible plastic cover.
Internal thermostats prevent overheating and regulate the temperature. The
hand control usually provides 3 heat settings by switching in different
sections of the heating element and/or just selecting which thermostat is
used.

There are no serviceable parts inside the sealed cover - forget it as any
repair would represent a safety hazard. The control unit may develop bad or
worn switches but even this is somewhat unlikely. It is possible to
disassemble the control and then test the wiring to the pad itself for low
resistance (a few hundred ohms) between any pair of wires). If these test
open, it is time for a new heating pad. Otherwise, check the plug, cord, and
control switches.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.41 "Electric blankets"

As with heating pads, the only serviceable parts are the controller and
cordset. The blanket itself is effectively sealed against any repair so that
any damage that might impact safety will necessitate replacement.

Older style controllers used a bimetal thermostat which actually sensed air
temperature, not under-cover conditions. This, it turns out, is a decent
measurement and does a reasonable job of maintaining a comfortable heat
setting. Such controllers produced those annoying clicks every couple of
minutes as the thermostat cycled. Problems with the plug, cord, power switch,
and thermostat contacts are possible. The entire controller usually unplugs
and can be replaced as a unit as well.

Newer designs use solid state controls and do away with the switch contacts -
and the noise. Aside from the plug and cord, troubleshooting of a faulty or
erratic temperature control is beyond the scope of this manual.

@endnode
@node 7.42 "Humidifiers"

-----------

There are three common types:

  1. Wet pad or drum - a fan blows air across a stationary or rotating
     material which is water soaked. There can be mechanical problems with
     the fan or drum motor or electrical problems with the plug, cord, power
     switch, or humidistat.

  2. Spray - an electrically operated valve controls water sprayed from a
     fine nozzle. Problems can occur with the solenoid valve (test the coil
     with an ohmmeter), humidistat, or wiring. The fine orifice may get
     clogged by particles circulating in the water or hard water deposits. In
     cleaning, use only soft materials like pointy bits of wood or plastic to
     avoid enlarging the hole in the nozzle.

  3. Ultrasonic - a high frequency power oscillator drives a piezo electric
     'nebulizer' which (with the aid of a small fan) literally throws fine
     droplets of water out into the room. Problems with the actual ultrasonic
     circuitry is beyond the scope of this manual but other common failures
     can be dealt with like plug, cord, fan motor, control switches, wiring,
     etc. However, if everything appears to working but there is no mist from
     the output port, it is likely that the ultrasonic circuitry has failed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.43 "Dehumidifiers"

Electric dehumidifiers use a refrigeration system to cool a set of coils
which condenses water vapor. The heat is then returned to the air and it is
returned back to the room. On the surface, this seems like an incredible
waste of energy - cooling the air and heating it back up - but it is very
effective at removing moisture. A typical large dehumidifier will condense
something like 30 pints in 24 hours - which, unless you have it located over
a drain - then needs to be dumped by hand.

There is supposed to be a cutoff (float) switch to stop the dehumidifier when
the container is full. Hopefully, it works (and you didn't neglect to install
it when the unit was new!)

Common problems with these units are often related to the fan, humidistat, or
just plain dirt - which tends to collect on the cooling coils. The sealed
refrigeration system is generally quite reliable and will never need
attention.

An annual cleaning of the coils with a soft brush and a damp cloth is a good
idea. If the fan has lubrication holes, a couple of drops (but no more) of
electric motor oil should be added at the same time.

The fan uses an induction motor - shaded pole probably - and may require
cleaning and lubrication. See the section: @{"Problems with induction motors" link "14.9"}

The humidistat may develop dirty or worn contacts or the humidity sensing
material - sort of like a hot dog wrapper - may break. If you don't hear a
click while rotating the control through its entire range, this may have
happened. If you hear the click - and the dehumidifier is plugged into a live
outlet - but nothing happens, then there is probably a problem in the wiring.
If just the fan turns on but not the compressor, (and you have waited at
least 5 minutes for the internal pressures to equalize after stopping the
unit) then there may be a problem with the compressor or its starting relay
(especially if the lights dim indicating a high current).

A very low line voltage condition could also prevent a refrigeration system
from starting or result in overheating and cycling. A sluggish slow rotating
or seized fan, or excessive dirt buildup may also lead to overheating and
short cycling.

A unit that ices up may simply be running when it is too cold (and you don't
really need it anyway). Dehumidifiers may include sensors to detect ice
buildup and/or shut off if the temperature drops below about 60 degrees F.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.44 "Garbage disposals"

A garbage disposal is just an AC induction motor driving a set of centrifugal
hammers (they used to use sharp cutters but these were even more dangerous).
The cutters throw the food against an outer ring with relatively sharp slots
which break up the food into particles that can be handled (hopefully) by the
waste system. However, always use generous amounts of cold water (which helps
to cool the motor as well) and let it run for a while after there is nothing
left in the disposal and it has quieted down. This will assure a trouble free
drain. Otherwise, you may be inviting your friendly plumber over for a visit!

Common problems with garbage disposals relate to three areas:

   o Something stuck in grinding chamber - disposal hums or trips internal
     protector (red button) or main fuse or circuit breaker. Unplug disposal!
     Then use the wrench (or appropriate size hex wrench) that came with the
     disposal to work rotor back and forth from bottom. If there is no hole
     for a wrench (or you misplaced yours), try a broom handle from above but
     NEVER put your hand in to try to unjam it (there are still relatively
     sharp parts involved). With the disposer unplugged, you can carefully
     reach in and feel for any objects that may be stuck or which cannot be
     broken up by the grinding action (like forks, toys, rocks, beef bones,
     etc.) and fish these out. Once free, restore power (if needed) and/or
     reset red button ((usually underneath the motor housing - you may have
     to wait a couple minutes until it will reset (click and stay in). Then
     run the unit with full flow of cold water for a couple of minutes to
     clear anything remaining from the grinding chamber and plumbing.

   o Motor - although these only run for a few seconds a day, motor problems
     including shorted windings or defective rotors are possible. Assuming
     rotor turns feely, these may include a hum but no movement, repeated
     blown fuses or tripped circuit breakers, or any burning smells.

   o Leaking shaft seal - probably what causes most disposals to ultimately
     fail. The upper seal develops a slight leak which permits water to enter
     the motor housing damaging the bearing and causing electrical problems.
     Symptoms include seized rotor, excessive noise or vibration, actual
     water leaking from inside the motor housing, burning smells, etc.

   o Power switch (built into batch feed models) - wall switches can go bad
     like any other application. The built in magnetic or microswitch in a
     batch feed disposal can also fail. Intermittent or no operation may
     result.

   o Drain blockage - disposal runs but water doesn't get pumped out of sink
     or backs up. Use plumber's helper (plunger) or better yet, remove U-trap
     under sink and use a plumber's (steel) snake to clear blockage in the
     waste pipe. NEVER NEVER use anything caustic!!! First of all, it will
     not likely work (don't believe those ads!). More importantly, it will
     leave a dangerous corrosive mess behind for you or the plumber to clean
     up. The plunger or snake will work unless the blockage is so impacted or
     in a bad location (like a sharp bend) in which case a professional will
     need to be called in any case.

Unless you are the truly die-hard doit-yourselfer, repair of disposals is
probably not a good use of your time. The ultimate reliability of all but the
most obvious and simple repairs is usually unknown and could be very short.
However, other than time, there is nothing to be lost by at least
investigating the source of the problem.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.44.1 "Garbage disposal pops reset button but nothing blocked"

Even if nothing is stuck in it, is the rotor free - not too tight? If you
have that little wrench that comes with many disposers, you should be able to
turn the rotor relatively easily (I would say about 1 foot-pound of torque or
less if your arm is calibrated). A tight bearing may be the result of a shaft
seal leak - see the next section: @{"Garbage disposal seizes repeatedly" link "7.44.2"}

The red reset button is a circuit breaker. Either the motor is drawing too
much current due to a shorted winding or a tight bearing or the breaker is
faulty. Without an ammeter, it will be tough to determine which it is unless
the rotor is obviously too tight.

If you have a clamp-on ammeter, the current while the motor is running should
be less than the nameplate value (startup will be higher). If it is too high,
than there is likely a problem with the motor. As an alternate you could try
bypassing the circuit breaker with a slow blow fuse of the same rating as the
breaker (it hopefully will be marked) or a replacement breaker (from another
dead garbage disposal!. If this allows the disposer to run continuously your
original little circuit breaker is bad. These should be replaceable.

If the bearings are tight, it is probably not worth fixing unless it is due
to something stuck between the grinding disk and the base. Attempting to
disassemble the entire unit is likely to result in a leak at the top bearing
though with care, it is possible to do this successfully.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.44.2 "Garbage disposal seizes repeatedly"

A garbage disposal that doesn't have anything stuck in the cutting chamber
but seems to be hard to turn or will work with effort until left alone for a
day or two probably has a bad bearing caused by a leak at the shaft seal. Of
course, water gushing out of the lower part of the disposal (or *any* amount
of water dripping from inside the motor housing) is one indication that there
is a leak! This also represents a safety hazard so the disposal should be
left unplugged and not be used even if it still runs.

By the time the leak is detected, it is probably too late to save the
disposal as corrosion of the steel shaft, excessive wear of the bronze
bushing, as well as possible electrical damage has already occurred.

Realistically, there is nothing that could have likely been done in any case.
It is virtually impossible to repack such a bearing in such a way to assure
that a leak will not develop in the near future.

It is time for an upgrade. My general recommendation is to get the
approximately $100 1/2-3/4 Hp Sears (In-Sinkerator manufactured) unit when it
is on sale (which is about every week). These now have at least a 4 year
warranty.

@endnode
@node 7.45 "Sump pumps and utility pumps"

Sump pumps come in two major varieties:

  1. Pedestal - a motor on top of a 3 foot or so pole drives an impeller at
     the bottom of its long shaft. Only the base may be submerged.

  2. Submersible - a motor, usually totally enclosed in a sealed pump housing
     within an oil bath drives an impeller. The entire unit is designed to be
     fully or partially submerged in the sump hole.

Utility pumps are often of the submersible variety.

Three types of automatic switches are commonly used:

  1. Float/weight on a wire, rod, or string pulls on a spring action toggle
     type switch. The length of the linkage is adjusted for the appropriate
     low and high water settings. These will be used mostly with pedestal
     pumps. If properly sized, this type of switch can be quite reliable - I
     have a sump pump using this type of switch which is easily 30 years old
     at this point without ever having any problems with the switch.

  2. Mercury tilt switch sealed inside a rubber float. By fastening its
     connecting wire to a suitable location, the level of the water will
     cause the float to pivot from horizontal the more vertical. An enclosed
     mercury switch then controls power to the pump motor. These are not
     serviceable but replacements are readily available.

  3. Diaphragm pressure switch designed to sense the depth of the water from
     the trapped pressure. As above, these are not really serviceable but can
     be easily replaced by the same or a mercury type (2).

@node 7.46 "Toys"

Since there are a semiinfinite number of variations on electrically powered
toys, the only comment I have is that these are almost always combinations of
small PM motors, switches, batteries, light bulbs - and totally impossible to
identify electronic components. With small kids, physical destruction is
probably a much more common occurrence than a part failure!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.1 "Types of motors found in power tools"

A variety of motor types are used depending on the type of tool. AC powered
portable tools usually use a universal motor due to it high power/weight
ratio and ease of electronic speed control. Cordless tools usually use a high
performance permanent magnet DC motor. Stationary power tools almost always
use some form of AC induction motor except where variable speed is required.

See the sections on these types of @{"motors" link "14"} for more details than the following
summaries provide.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.2 "Motors in AC line operated portable tools"

Line operated portable (corded) power tools usually use a universal type AC
motor providing 3,000 to 30,000 rpm at the motor shaft. For the same power
rating, these will be significantly lighter than an induction motor.

A single or multiple stage gear reducer drops the relatively high speed at
which these motors are most efficient to whatever the tool actually requires,
increasing the torque as well.

Universal motors can also be speed controlled relatively easily using a
variant of a simple light dimmer type circuit. Excellent torque is maintained
over a very wide range extending to hearly 0 rpm.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.3 "Motors in cordless power tools"

These are usually high performance permanent magnet DC motors using advanced
high strength and exotic magnetic materials. They are very compact and light
weight for their power output. As with all DC (brush type) motors, brush wear
is a common problem.

Speed control is easily accomplished by low cost electronic circuits which
chop the power (pulse width modulation) rather than simply using a reostat.
This is much more efficient - extremely important with any battery operated
device.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.4 "Motors in stationary power tools"

Stationary power tools which do not require continuous speed control will
generally use some type of AC induction motor - split phase or capacitor
start/run. The motors generally operate at a fixed speed of around either
1725 or 3450 rpm (U.S., 60 Hz power). Stepped pulleys or continuous
mechanical speed/torque changers are used to obtain (usually) lower work
piece speeds.

For example, a typical drill press may have one or two sets of stepped
pulleys providing 3 to 15 or more speeds by changing belt positions. A
continuously variable cone drive is also available as an option on some
models. This is extremely convenient but does add cost and is usually not
found on less expensive models.

An internal thermal overload protector may be incorporated into larger
motors.  WARNING: this may be self resetting. If the tool stops on its own,
switch off and unplug it before attempting to determine the cause.

Generally, these induction motors are virtually maintenance-free though
cleaning, tensioning, and lubrication may be required of the drive system.

However, electronic speed control of induction motors, while possible, is
relatively complex and expensive requiring a variable frequency variable
voltage power supply. Therefore, universal motors may be used on stationary
tools like scroll saws with continuously variable electronic speed control.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.5 "About horsepower ratings"

One horsepower is equal to 746 watts of electrical power (100% efficiency).
Therefore, the most you can get continuously from a normal 115 V 15 A outlet
is about 2 HP. Any claims (for air compressors, for example) of higher
ratings on a normal outlet are totally bogus. Companies such as Sears
(Craftsman) like to specify 'Reserve Power' for their power tools which as
best as I can determine refers to the power available for a short time and
may relate to the mass - and inertia - of the rotating parts but not the
continuous power available. This may be useful to help saw through a tough
knot in a piece of hardwood but may not be terribly meaningful for a wet/dry
vacuum! Therefore, pay most attention to the continuous power ratings if they
can be found anywhere. A good indication is probably the maximum amps
required for the electrical service.

As with over-the-counter drugs, extra strength does not necessarily translate
into faster relief, higher current does not always mean better performance,
and horsepower ratings much above what you would compute from V x A may be
more of a marketing gimmick than anything really beneficial.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.6 "Cords for AC line operated portable power tools"

Really old power tools had two wire cord plugs and no safety ground yet were
of all metal (solid and heavy!) construction. I would recommend that as a
matter of policy, these be retrofitted with a 3 wire grounded cordset.

Newer ones have the grounded cordset while the newest 'double insulated
tools' are of mostly plastic construction and are back to a 2 wire ungrounded
cord.

As with any electrical appliances, inspect cords regularly and repair or
replace any that are seriously damaged - if the inner wiring is showing,
nicked, or cut; if the plug is broken or gets hot during use, or where the
cord is pulled from or broken at the strain relief.

The portable electric drill (now the rage is cordless) is probably one of the
two first tools that any handyman should own (the other being a saber saw).

large holes, sanding, polishing, driving screws, etc. Therefore, these tools
get a lot of use - and abuse.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.8 "AC line powered drills"

An AC line powered electric drill is just a universal motor with a two stage
(typical) gear reduced powering a chuck to hold the drill bit or attachment.
A continuous range speed control with a reversing switch is now standard on
most AC line powered drills.

Typical problems include:

   o Worn bearings. These may be replaceable. Also see the section:
     @{"Upgrading the bearings on a Craftsman drill" link "8.9"}

   o Worn motor brushes. Replacements should be available. from the
     manufacturer or a motor/appliance repair shop.

   o Broken or chipped gears. This is rare under normal conditions but if the
     drill was abused, then failure is possible.

   o Bad cord or plug. Repair or replace for safety reasons.

   o Bad speed controller/reversing switch. Replacement trigger assemblies
     are available but may cost half as much as an entire new drill. One
     common wear item is the linear potentiometer operated by the trigger and
     this is not likely to be a standard component. The drill may work fine
     as a single speed model if this control fails. You could always use an
     inexpensive external motor speed controller in this case.

   o Bad motor. Failures are possible but unless abused, not nearly as common
     as other simple problems like bad brushes or bearings. It may not be
     cost effective to replace a bad armature or stator unless this is an
     expensive high quality drill or you have a similar model available for
     parts.

   o Rusted or gummed up chuck. (Or, lost chuck key!). The chuck is
     replaceable. Depending on type, it may mount with a right or left hand
     screw thread and possibly a right or left hand retaining screw through
     the center. See the owner's manual to determine what your drill uses as
     you could be attempting to tighten rather than loosen the chuck if you
     turn the wrong way. If by some slight chance you do not have the owner's
     manual :-), a reversible drill will usually have a left hand (reversed)
     thread on the chuck and a retaining screw with a right hand (normal)
     thread. A non-reversible drill will only have a right hand thread on the
     chuck and probably no retaining screw. There may be a hole to insert a
     locking rod to prevent the shaft from turning as you attempt to loosen
     the chuck. Inserting the chuck key or a suitable substitute and gently
     tapping it with a hammer in the proper direction may be useful as well
     to free the chuck.

     A gummed up but not too badly rusted chuck can be rescued with
     penetrating oil like WD40 or Liquid Wrench: spray it into the chuck, let
     it sit for few minutes, then use the chuck key to start working it back
     and forth. Pretty soon it should be free - rotate through its entire
     range back and forth. Spray and spin a couple more times and it should
     be fine for another 20.000 holes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.9 "Upgrading the bearings on a Craftsman drill"

Very inexpensive models (like the $30 Father's day specials) may use sleeve
bearings in various locations instead of better quality longer lived ball or
roller bearings. One particular bearing tends to deteriorate rapidly,
especially if the drill is used for sanding or in dusty work environments (as
opposed to clean rooms :-) ). This is the motor bearing at the handle end.
The lubrication dries out or is absorbed by dust particles, the bearing runs
dry, wears, and fails with an ear shattering squeal. Even if you use ear
plugs, the speed and power are not adequate as the motor is laboring and
overloaded and motor failure would result from prolonged operation.

I have upgraded a couple of these drills to ball bearings. The substitution
is straightforward requiring disassembly of the drill - removing of the front
gear reducer and then one side of the case. At this point, the old sleeve
bearing is easily freed from its mounting (just the plastic of the case) and
pulled from the shaft. The shaft is likely undamaged unless you attempted to
continue running the drill even after going deaf.

The drills I upgraded had bearings that were 7/8" OD, 5/16" thick, and with a
5/16" ID center hole. The old ones were worn by almost 1/32" oversize for the
center hole but the motor shaft was undamaged. I found suitable replacement
double sealed ball bearings in my junk box but I would assume that they are
fairly standard - possibly even available from Sears Parts as I bet they are
used in the next model up.

If the gear reducer needs to come apart to access the motor, take note of any
spacer washers or other small parts so you can get them back in exactly the
correct locations. Work in a clean area to avoid contaminating the grease
packing.

The bearing should be a press fit onto the shaft. Very light sanding of the
shaft with 600 grit sandpaper may be needed - just enough so that the new
bearing can be pressed on. Or, gently tap the center race with hammer
(protected with a block of wood). Make sure that the bearing is snug when
mounted so that the outer race cannot rotate - use layers of thin heat
resistant plastic if needed to assure a tight fit (the old sleeve bearing was
keyed but your new ball bearing probably won't have this feature).

These drills now run as smoothly as Sears much more expensive models.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.10 "Cordless drills"

Cordless drills use a permanent magnet DC motor operating off of a NiCd
(usually) battery pack. Manufacturers make a big deal out of the voltage of
the pack - 6, 7.2, 9.6, 12, 14, 18, etc. - but this really isn't a sure
measure of power and time between charges as a motor can be designed for any
reasonable voltage. A gear reducer follows the motor driving a chuck for
holding the drill or screwdriver bit, or attachment. These are most often
have a single or two speeds with reverse.

In addition to the problems listed in the section: @{"AC line powered drills" link "8.8"}
these are also subject to all the maladies of battery operated appliances.
Cordless tools are particularly vulnerable to battery failure since they are
often use rapid charge (high current) techniques.

   o Bad NiCd batteries - reduced capacity or shorted cells. In most cases, a
     new pack will be required.

   o Bad power/speed selection/reversing switch. Replace.

   o Bad motor. These are usually permanent magnet brushed type motors. Worn
     brushes and bearings are common problems. In addition, a partially
     shorted motor due to commutator contamination is also possible - see the
     sections on PM DC @{"motors" link "14"}. Disassembly, cleaning, and lubrication may be
     possible.

   o Routers, biscuit cutters - high speed (30,000 rpm typical) universal
     motor with a 1/4" (fixed size, router) chuck for common router bits.

     Ball bearings are used which have long life but are probably replaceable
     if they fail (noisy, excessive runout, etc.).

     The plug, cord, trigger, and interlock switches are prone to problems
     and should be checked if the tool doesn't run at all.

@endnode
@node 8.12 "Saber saws, reciprocating saws"

These use a universal motor which drives a gear reducer and reciprocating
mechanism. Better models have a variable speed control so that the sawing
rate can be optimized to the work. All but the most inexpensive allow the
head to be rotated or rotate automatically based on feed direction adding a
bit of complexity.

A reciprocating saw is very similar but uses a much larger motor and beefier
gearing.

In addition to motor problems, there can be problems with damage, dirt, or
need for lubrication of the reciprocating mechanism.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.13 "Electric chain saws"

These have a high power universal motor and gear reducer. Most have the motor
mounted transversely with normal pinion type gears driving the chain
sprocket.  A few models have the motor mounted along the axis of the saw - I
consider this less desirable as the gyroscopic character of the rotating
motor armature may tend to twist the saw as it is tilted into the work.

One key to long blade and bar life is the liberal use of the recommended
chain oil. Inexpensive models may have a manual oiler requiring constant
attention but automatic oilers are common. These are probably better - if
they work.

There may be a slip clutch to protect the motor if the chain gets stuck in a
log. After a while, this may loosen resulting in excessive slippage or the
chain stopping even under normal conditions. The slip clutch can generally be
tightened with a screwdriver.

These have a high power universal motor either directly driving the blade or
driving a gear reducer (high torque/large blade variety).

Miter and cutoff saws are similar but are mounted on a tilting mechanism with
accurate alignment guides (laser lights in the most expensive!).

@node 8.15 "Grinding wheels"

A dual shaft induction motor drives rotating grinding stones (or other tools
like wire brushes). Most common are fixed speed - usually around 3450 rpm but
variable speed operation is highly desirable to avoid overheating of tempered
metal during sharpening. All but the most inexpensive use sealed ball
bearings requiring no routine maintenance.

Small light duty grinders may be 1/4 HP or less. However, this is adequate
for many home uses.

Wet wheels may run at much slower speeds to keep heat to a minimum. Being in
close proximity to water may in itself create problems.

A gear reduced universal motor drives a rubber (usually) mounting plate to
which a sanding disk or polishing pad is attached.

Due to the nature of their use, sanders in particular may accumulate a lot of
dust and require frequent cleaning and lubrication.

A typical portable belt sander uses a gear or belt reduced universal motor
driving one of the rollers that the sanding belt rotates on under tension. In
decent quality tools, these should use ball or roller bearings which require
little attention.

A power planer is similar in many ways but the motor drives a set of cutters
rather than a sanding belt.

@node 8.19 "Air compressors"

A direct or belt drive induction motor (probably capacitor start) powers a
single or multiple cylinder piston type compressor. Typical continuous motor
ratings are between 1/4 and 2 HP (for a 115 VAC line). Over and under
pressure switches are used to maintain the pressure in an attached storage
tank within useful - and safe - limits. Most will include an unloading valve
to remove pressure on the pistons when the compressor stops so that it can be
easily restarted without damage to the motor and without blowing fuses or
tripping circuit breakers.

I much prefer a belt driven compressor to a direct drive unit. One reason is
that a motor failure does not render the entire compressor useless as any
standard motor can be substituted. The direct drive motor may be a custom
unit and locating a replacement cheaply may be difficult.

Drain the water that collects in the tank after each use.

Inspect the tank regularly for serious rust or corrosion which could result
in an explosion hazard.as well.

@endnode
@node 8.20 "Paint sprayers"

Traditional air powered paint sprayers may simply be an attachment to an air
compressor or may be a self contained unit with the compressor built in.
Since the active material is paint which dries into a hard mass (what a
concept!), cleaning immediately after use is essential. Otherwise, strong
solvents will be needed to resurrect a congealed mess - check your user's
manual for acceptable deadly chemicals.

Portable airless paint sprayers use a solenoid-piston mechanism inside the
spray head itself. There is little to go wrong electrically other than the
trigger switch as long as it is cleaned after use.

Professional airless paint sprayers use a hydraulic pump to force the paint
through a narrow orifice at extremely high pressure like 1000 psi.

With all types, follow the manufacturer's recommendations as to type and
thickness of paint as well as the care and maintenance before and after use
and for storage.

WARNING: high performance paint sprayers in particular may be a safety hazard
should you put your finger close to the output orifice accidentally. The
pressures involved could be sufficient to inject paint - and anything else in
the stream - through the skin resulting in serious infection or worse.

@node 8.23 "Soldering irons"

Simple pencil irons use an enclosed heating element is attached to the
'business' end in some manner - screw thread, set screw, clamping ring, etc.
Failure to heat may be due to a bad plug, cord, bad connections, or defective
element.

Some types package the heating element and replaceable tip in a separate
screw-in assembly. These are easily interchangeable to select the appropriate
wattage for the job. Damage is possible to their ceramic insulator should one
be dropped or just from constant use.

High quality temperature controlled soldering stations incorporate some type
of thermostatic control - possibly even with a digital readout.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.24 "Soldering guns"

The common Weller Dual Heat soldering gun is a simple transformer with the
tapped primary winding in the bulk of the case and a single turn secondary
capable of 100 or more amps at around 1.5 V. The soldering element is simply
a piece of copper (possible with a shaped tip) which is heated due to the
high current passing through it even though it is made mostly of copper. The
'headlight(s)' (flashlight bulbs) operate off of a winding on the transformer
as well.

Possible problems include:

   o No response to trigger - bad cord, bad switch, open transformer primary.

   o Low or high (dual heat models) does not work - bad switch, bad
     transformer primary.

   o Lack of sufficient heat - bad connections where soldering element
     mounts. clean and/or tighten. Tin the tip if needed (not permanently
     tinned). Use the high setting (dual heat models).

   o Tip too hot - use the lower setting (if dual heat). Do not keep the
     trigger depressed for more than 30 seconds or so at a time. Manually
     pulse width modulate the power level.

   o Entire unit overheats - this could be a shorted winding in the
     transformer but more likely is that you are simply not giving it a
     chance to cool. It is not designed for continuous operation - something
     like 2 minutes on, 5 minutes off, is usually recommended.

   o No light - bad bulbs, bad connections, bad winding (unlikely).

NOTE: a soldering gun is not a precision instrument and should not be used
for fine electronics work - you will ruin ICs and printed circuit boards.
(However, I have heard of someone replacing an MC68000 microprocessor (64 pin
DIP) successfully with a large Weller soldering gun!)

@node 8.25 "Wet-dry vacs, yard blowers/vacs"

A powerful universal motor driving a centrifugal blower is all there is in
this equipment. Unfortunately, many common models use cheaply made motors
which may fail simply due to use or from the dust and proximity to liquids.
The blower sucks air and whatever else into the holding tank. A filter is
supposed to prevent anything from getting through. The motor itself should be
sealed against direct contact with the dust/liquid section of the machine.

Problems occur with bad cords, switch, motor brushes, bearings, or a burnt
out motor from excessive use under adverse conditions.

As with inexpensive electric drills, sleeve bearings (usually, the top
bearing which is exposed somewhat) in the motor can become worn or dry.
Replacing with a ball bearing is a worthwhile - but rather involved -
undertaking if this happens. See the section:
@{"Upgrading the bearings on a Craftsman drill" link "8.9"} as the technique is similar
(once you gain access - not usually a 10 minute job).

@node 8.26 "Hedge trimmers"

A gear reduced universal motor drives a reciprocating mechanism not too
dissimilar to a saber saw. In addition to the usual motor/electrical
problems, lubrication may be needed periodically. Should you accidentally try
to trim a steel fence instead of a bush, damage to one or more teeth may
occur. In this case, light filing may be needed to remove nicks and burrs.

Of course, you probably will not get away without cutting the power cord a
couple of times as well! See the section on @{"power cords" link "6.1.1"}. One way to avoid
the humiliation (other than being half awake) is to wrap a cord protector
around the first 2 or 3 feet of cord at the tool. This will make the cord
larger in diameter than the inter-tooth spacing preventing accidental
chewups.

@endnode
@node 9.1 "AC adapter basics"

It seems that the world now revolves around AC Adapters or 'Wall Warts' as
they tend to be called. There are several basic types. Despite the fact that
the plugs to the equipment may be identical THESE CAN GENERALLY NOT BE
INTERCHANGED. The type (AC or DC), voltage, current capacity, and polarity
are all critical to proper operation of the equipment. Use of an improper
adapter or even just reverse polarity can permanently damage or destroy the
device. Most equipment is protected against stupidity to a greater or lessor
degree but don't count on it.

The most common problems are due to failure of the output cable due to
flexing at either the adapter or output plug end. See section on @{"repair procedure" link "9.3"}

  1. AC Transformer. All wall warts are often called transformers. However,
     only if the output is stated to be 'AC' is the device simply a
     transformer. These typically put out anywhere from 3 to 20 VAC or more
     at 50 mA to 3 A or more. The most common range from 6-15 VAC at less
     than an Amp. Typically, the regulation is very poor so that an adapter
     rated at 12 VAC will typically put out 14 VAC with no load and drop to
     less than 12 VAC at rated load. To gain agency approval, these need to
     be protected internally so that there is no fire hazard even if the
     output is shorted. There may be a fuse or thermal fuse internally
     located (and inaccessible).

     If the output tested inside the adapter (assuming that you can get it
     open without total destruction - it is secured with screws and is not
     glued or you are skilled with a hacksaw - measures 0 or very low with no
     load but plugged into a live outlet, either the transformer has failed
     or the internal fuse had blown. In either case, it is probably easier to
     just buy a new adapter but sometimes these can be repaired.
     Occasionally, it will be as simple as a bad connection inside the
     adapter. Check the fine wires connected to the AC plug as well as the
     output connections. There may be a thermal fuse buried under the outer
     layers of the transformer which may have blown. These can be replaced
     but locating one may prove quite a challenge.

  2. DC Power Pack. In addition to a step down transformer, these include at
     the very least a rectifier and filter capacitor. There may be additional
     regulation but most often there is none. Thus, while the output is DC,
     the powered equipment will almost always include an electronic
     regulation.

     As above, you may find bad connections or a blown fuse or thermal fuse
     inside the adapter but the most common problems are with the cable.

  3. Switching Power Supply. These are complete low power AC-DC converters
     using a high frequency invertor. Most common applications are laptop
     computers and camcorders. The output(s) will be fairly well regulated
     and these will often accept universal power - 90-250 V AC or DC.

     Again, cable problems predominate but failures of the switching power
     supply components are also possible. If the output is dead and you have
     eliminated the cable as a possible problem or the output is cycling on
     and off at approximately a 1 second rate, then some part of the
     switching power supply may be bad. In the first case, it could be a
     blown fuse, bad startup resistor, shorted/open semiconductors, bad
     controller, or other components. If the output is cycling, it could be a
     shorted diode or capacitor, or a bad controller. See the "Notes on the
     Diagnosis and Repair of Small Switchmode Power Supplies" for more info,
     especially on safety while servicing these units.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.2 "AC adapter testing"

AC adapters that are not the switching type (1 and 2 above) can easily be
tested with a VOM or DMM. The voltage you measure (AC or DC) will probably be
10-25% higher than the label specification. If you get no reading, wiggle,
squeeze, squish, and otherwise abuse the cord both at the wall wart end and
at the device end. You may be able to get it to make momentary contact and
confirm that the adapter itself is functioning.

The most common problem is one or both conductors breaking internally at one
of the ends due to continuous bending and stretching.

Make sure the outlet is live - try a lamp.

Make sure any voltage selector switch is set to the correct position. Move it
back and forth a couple of times to make sure the contacts are clean.

If the voltage readings check out for now, then wiggle the cord as above in
any case to make sure the internal wiring is intact - it may be intermittent.

Although it is possible for the adapter to fail in peculiar ways, a
satisfactory voltage test should indicate that the adapter is functioning
correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.3 "AC adapter repair"

Although the cost of a new adapter is usually modest, repair is often so easy
that it makes sense in any case.

The most common problem (and the only one we will deal with here) is the case
of a broken wire internal to the cable at either the wall wart or device end
due to excessive flexing of the cable.

Usually, the point of the break is just at the end of the rubber cable guard.
If you flex the cable, you will probably see that it bends more easily here
than elsewhere due to the broken inner conductor. If you are reasonably
dextrous, you can cut the cable at this point, strip the wires back far
enough to get to the good copper, and solder the ends together. Insulate
completely with several layers of electrical tape. Make sure you do not
interchange the two wires for DC output adapters! (They are usually marked
somehow either with a stripe on the insulator, a thread inside with one of
the conductors, or copper and silver colored conductors. Before you cut, make
a note of the proper hookup just to be sure. Verify polarity after the repair
with a voltmeter.

The same procedure can be followed if the break is at the device plug end but
you may be able to buy a replacement plug which has solder or screw terminals
rather than attempting to salvage the old one.

Once the repair is complete, test for correct voltage and polarity before
connecting the powered equipment.

This repair may not be pretty, but it will work fine, is safe, and will last
a long time if done carefully.

If the adapter can be opened - it is assembled with screws rather than being
glued together - then you can run the good part of the cable inside and
solder directly to the internal terminals. Again, verify the polarity before
you plug in your expensive equipment.

WARNING: If this is a switching power supply type of adapter, there are
dangerous voltages present inside in addition to the actual line connections.
Do not touch any parts of the internal circuitry when plugged in and make
sure the large filter capacitor is discharged (test with a voltmeter) before
touching or doing any work on the circuit board. For more info on switching
power supply repair, refer to the "Notes on the Diagnosis and Repair of Small
Switchmode Power Supplies".

If it is a normal adapter, then the only danger when open are direct
connections to the AC plug. Stay clear when it is plugged in.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.4 "AC adapter substitution and equipment damage"

Those voltage and current ratings are there for a reason. You may get away
with a lower voltage or current adapter without permanent damage but using a
higher voltage adapter is playing Russian Roulette. Even using an adapter
from a different device - even with similar ratings, may be risky because
there is no real standard. A 12 V adapter from one manufacturer may put out
12 V at all times whereas one from another manufacturer may put out 20 V or
more when unloaded.

A variety of types of protection are often incorporated into adapter powered
equipment. Sometimes these actually will save the day. Unfortunately,
designers cannot anticipate all the creative techniques people use to prove
they really do not have a clue of what they are doing.

The worst seems to be where an attempt is made to operate portable devices
off of an automotive electrical system. Fireworks are often the result, see
below and the section on: @{"Automotive power" link "10.14"}

If you tried an incorrect adapter and the device now does not work there are
several possibilities (assuming the adapter survived and this is not the
problem):

  1. An internal fuse blew. This would be the easiest to repair.

  2. A protection diode sacrificed itself. This is usually reverse biased
     across the input and is supposed to short out the adapter if the
     polarity is reversed. However, it may have failed shorted particularly
     if you used a high current adapter (or automotive power).

  3. Some really expensive hard to obtain parts blew up. Unfortunately, this
     outcome is all too common.

I inherited a Sony Discman from a guy who thought he would save a few bucks
and make an adapter cord to use it in his car. Not only was the 12-15 volts
from the car battery too high but he got it backwards! Blew the DC-DC
converter transistor in two despite the built in reverse voltage protection
and fried the microcontroller. Needless to say, the player was a loss but the
cigarette lighter fuse was happy as a clam!

Moral: those voltage, current, and polarity ratings marked on portable
equipment are there for a reason. Voltage rating should not be exceeded,
though using a slightly lower voltage adapter will probably cause no harm
though performance may suffer. The current rating of the adapter should be at
least equal to the printed rating. The polarity, of course, must be correct.
If connected backwards with a current limited adapter, there may be no
immediate damage depending on the design of the protective circuits. But
don't take chances - double check that the polarities match - with a
voltmeter if necessary - before you plug it in! Note that even some
identically marked adapters put out widely different open circuit voltages.
If the unloaded voltage reading is more than 25-30% higher than the marked
value, I would be cautious about using the adapter without confirmation that
it is acceptable for your equipment. Needless to say, if you experience any
strange or unexpected behavior with a new adapter, if any part gets unusually
warm, or if there is any unusual odor, unplug it immediately and attempt to
identify the cause of the problem.

@node 10.1 "Battery technology"

The desire for portable power seems to be increasing exponentially with the
proliferation of notebook and palmtop computers, electronic organizers, PDAs,
cellular phones and faxes, pagers, pocket cameras, camcorders and audio
cassette recorders, boomboxes - the list is endless.

Two of the hottest areas in engineering these days are in developing higher
capacity battery technologies (electrochemical systems) for rechargeable
equipment and in the implementation of smart power management (optimal
charging and high efficiency power conversion) for portable devices. Lithium
and Nickel Metal Hydride are among the more recent additions to the inventory
of popular battery technologies. A variety of ICs are now available to
implement rapid charging techniques while preserving battery life. Low cost
DC-DC convertor designs are capable of generating whatever voltages are
required by the equipment at over 90% efficiency

However, most of the devices you are likely to encounter still use pretty
basic battery technologies - most commonly throwaway Alkaline and Lithium
followed by rechargeable Nickel Cadmium or Lead-Acid. The charging circuits
are often very simple and don't really do the best job but it is adequate for
many applications.

For more detailed information on all aspects of battery technology, see the
articles at:

http://www.paranoia.com/~filipg/HTML/FAQ/BODY/F_Battery.html

There is more on batteries than you ever dreamed of ever needing. The
sections below represent just a brief introduction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.2 "Battery basics"

A battery is, strictly speaking, made up of a number of individual cells
(most often wired in series to provide multiples of the basic cell voltage
for the battery technology - 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, or 3.0 V are most common).
However, the term is popularly used even for single cells.

Four types of batteries are typically used in consumer electronic equipment:

  1. Alkaline - consisting of one or more primary cells with a nominal
     terminal voltage of 1.5 V. Examples are AAA, AA, C, D, N, 9V
     ('transistor'), lantern batteries (6V or more), etc. There are many
     other available sizes including miniature button cells for specialty
     applications like clocks, watches, calculators, and cameras. In general
     recharging of alkaline batteries is not practical due to their chemistry
     and construction. Exceptions which work (if not entirely consistently as
     of this writing) are the rechargeable Alkalines (e.g., 'Renewals').
     Advantages of alkalines are high capacity and long shelf life. These now
     dominate the primary battery marketplace largely replacing the original
     carbon-zinc and heavy duty types. Note that under most conditions, it
     not necessary to store alkaline batteries in the 'fridge to obtain
     maximum shelf life.

  2. Lithium - these primary cells have a much higher capacity than
     alkalines. The terminal voltage is around 3 volts per cell. These are
     often used in cameras where their high cost is offset by the convenience
     of long life and compact size. Lithium batteries in common sizes like 9V
     are beginning to appear. In general, I would not recommend the use of
     lithiums for use in applications where a device can be accidentally left
     on - particularly with kids' toys. Your batteries will be drained
     overnight whether a cheap carbon zinc or a costly lithium. However, for
     smoke alarms, the lithium 9V battery (assuming they hold up to their
     longevity claims) is ideal as a 5-10 year service life without attention
     can be expected.

  3. Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) - these are the most common type of rechargeable
     battery technology use in small electronic devices. They are available
     in all the poplar sizes. However, their terminal voltage is only 1.2 V
     per cell compared to 1.5 V per cell for alkalines (unloaded). This is
     not the whole story, however, as NiCds terminal voltage holds up better
     under load and as they are discharged. Manufacturers claim 500-1000
     charge-discharge cycles but expect to achieve these optimistic ratings
     only under certain types of applications. In particular it is usually
     recommended that NiCds should not be discharged below about 1 V per cell
     and should not be left in a discharged state for too long. Overcharging
     is also an enemy of NiCds and will reduce their ultimate life. An
     electric shaver is an example of a device that will approach this cycle
     life as it is used until the battery starts to poop out and then
     immediately put on charge. If a device is used and then neglected (like
     a seldom used printing calculator), don't be surprised to find that the
     NiCd battery will not charge or will not hold a charge next time the
     calculator is used.

  4. Lead Acid - similar to the type used in your automobile but generally
     specially designed in a sealed package which cannot leak acid under most
     conditions. These come in a wide variety of capacities but not in
     standard sizes like AA or D. They are used in some camcorders,
     flashlights, CD players, security systems, emergency lighting, and many
     other applications. Nominal terminal voltage is 2.0 V per cell. These
     batteries definitely do not like to be left in a discharged condition
     (even more so than NiCds) and will quickly become unusable if left that
     way for any length of time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.3 "Battery chargers"

Each type of battery requires a different type of charging technique.

  1. NiCd batteries are charged with a controlled (usually constant) current.
     Fast charge may be performed at as high as a .5-1C rate for the types of
     batteries in portable tools and laptop computers. (C here is the
     amp-hour capacity of the battery. A .5C charge rate for a 2 amp hour
     battery pack would use a current equal to 1 A, for example.) Trickle
     charge at a 1/20-1/10C rate. Sophisticated charges will use a variety of
     techniques to sense end-of-charge. Inexpensive chargers (and the type in
     many cheap consumer electronics devices) simply trickle charge at a
     constant current. Rapid chargers for portable tools, laptop computers,
     and camcorders, do at least sense the temperature rise which is one
     indication of having reached full charge but this is far from totally
     reliable and some damage is probably unavoidable as some cells reach
     full charge before others due to slight unavoidable differences in
     capacity. Better charging techniques depend on sensing the slight
     voltage drop that occurs when full charge is reached but even this can
     be deceptive. The best power management techniques use a combination of
     sensing and precise control of charge to each cell, knowledge about the
     battery's characteristics, and state of charge.

     Problems with simple NiCd battery chargers are usually pretty easy to
     find - bad transformer, rectifiers, capacitors, possibly a regulator.
     Where temperature sensing is used, the sensor in the battery pack may be
     defective and there may be problems in the control circuits as well.
     However, more sophisticated power management systems controlled by
     microprocessors or custom ICs and may be impossible to troubleshoot for
     anything beyond obviously bad parts or bad connections.

  2. Lead acid batteries are charged with a current limited but voltage
     cutoff technique. Although the terminal voltage of a lead-acid battery
     is 2.00 V per cell nominal, it may actually reach more than 2.5 V per
     cell while charging. For an automotive battery, 15 V is still within the
     normal range of voltages to be found on the battery terminals when the
     engine (and alternator) are running.

     A simple charger for a lead acid battery is simply a stepped down
     rectified AC source with some resistance to provide current limiting.
     The current will naturally taper off as the battery voltage approaches
     the peaks of the charging waveform. This is how inexpensive automotive
     battery chargers are constructed. For small sealed lead acid batteries,
     an IC regulator may be used to provide current limited constant voltage
     charging. A 1 A (max) charger for a 12 V battery may use an LM317, 3
     resistors, and two capacitors, running off of a 15 V or greater input
     supply.

     Problems with lead acid battery chargers are usually pretty easy to
     diagnose due to the simplicity of most designs. These are often just a
     power transformer and a set of large beefy rectifiers. Bad parts will be
     easily identified with a multimeter - if not by your senses alone.

@endnode
@node 10.4 "Substituting NiCds for Alkalines"

First note that rechargeable batteries are NOT suitable for safety critical
applications like smoke detectors unless they are used only as emergency
power fail backup (the smoke detector is also plugged into the AC line) and
are on continuous trickle charge). NiCds self discharge (with no load) at a
rate which will cause them to go dead in a month or two.

For many toys and games, portable phones, tape players and CD players, and
boomboxes, TVs, palmtop computers, and other battery gobbling gadgets, it may
be possible to substitute rechargeable batteries for disposable primary
batteries. However, NiCds have a lower terminal voltage - 1.2V vs. 1.5V - and
some devices will just not be happy. In particular, tape players may not work
well due to this reduced voltage not being able to power the motor at a
constant correct speed. Manufacturers may specifically warn against their
use.  Flashlights will not be as bright unless the light bulb is also
replaced with a lower voltage type. Other equipment may perform poorly or
fail to operate entirely on NiCds. When in doubt, check your instruction
manual.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.5 "Can a large electrolytic capacitor be substituted for a NiCd?"

The quick answer is: probably not. The charger very likely assumes that the
NiCds will limit voltage. The circuits found in many common appliances just
use a voltage source significantly higher than the terminal voltage of the
battery pack through a current limiting resistor. If you replace the NiCd
with a capacitor and the voltage will end up much higher than expected with
unknown consequences. For more sophisticated chargers, the results might be
even more unpredictable.

Furthermore, even a SuperCap cannot begin to compare to a small NiCd for
capacity. A 5.5 V 1 F (that's Farad) capacitor holds about 15 W-s of energy
which is roughly equivalent to a 5 V battery of 3 A-s capacity - less than 1
mA-h. A very tiny NiCd pack is 100 mA-h or two orders of magnitude larger.

@endnode
@node 10.6 "Determining the actual capacity of a NiCd battery"

When a battery pack is not performing up to expectations or is not marked in
terms of capacity, here are some comments on experimentally determining the
A-h rating.

When laying eggs, start with a chicken. Actually, you have to estimate the
capacity so that charge and discharge rates can be approximated. However,
this is usually easy to do with a factor of 2 either way just be size:

First, you must charge the battery fully. For a battery that does not appear
to have full capacity, this may be the only problem. Your charger may be
cutting off prematurely due to a fault in the charger and not the battery.
This could be due to dirty or corroded contacts on the charger or battery,
bad connections, faulty temperature sensor or other end-of-charge control
circuitry. Monitoring the current during charge to determine if the battery
is getting roughly the correct A-h to charge it fully would be a desirable
first step. Figure about 1.2 to 1.5 times the A-h of the battery capacity to
bring it to full charge.

Then discharge at approximately a C/20 - C/10 rate until the cell voltages
drops to about 1 V (don't discharge until flat or damage may occur). Capacity
is calculated as average current x elapsed time since the current for a NiCd
will be fairly constant until very near the end.

@node 10.7 "NiCd batteries and the infamous 'memory effect'"

Whether the NiCd 'memory effect' is fact or fiction seems to depend on one's
point of view and anecdotal evidence. What most people think is due to the
memory effect is more accurately described as voltage depression - reduced
voltage (and therefore, reduced power and capacity) during use.

(The next section is from: Bob Myers (myers@fc.hp.com) and are based on a GE
technical note on NiCd batteries.)

The following are the most common causes of application problems wrongly
attributed to 'memory':

  1. Cutoff voltage too high - basically, since NiCds have such a flat
     voltage vs. discharge characteristic, using voltage sensing to determine
     when the battery is nearly empty can be tricky; an improper setting
     coupled with a slight voltage depression can cause many products to call
     a battery "dead" even when nearly the full capacity remains usable
     (albeit at a slightly reduced voltage).

  2. High temperature conditions - NiCds suffer under high-temp conditions;
     such environments reduce both the charge that will be accepted by the
     cells when charging, and the voltage across the battery when charged
     (and the latter, of course, ties back into the above problem).

  3. Voltage depression due to long-term overcharge - Self-explanatory. NiCds
     can drop 0.1-0.15 V/cell if exposed to a long-term (i.e., a period of
     months) overcharge. Such an overcharge is not unheard-of in consumer
     gear, especially if the user gets in the habit of leaving the unit in a
     charger of simplistic design (but which was intended to provide enough
     current for a relatively rapid charge). As a precaution, I do NOT leave
     any of my NiCd gear on a charger longer than the recommended time UNLESS
     the charger is specifically designed for long-term "trickle charging",
     and explicitly identified as such by the manufacturer.

  4. There are a number of other possible causes listed in a "miscellaneous"
     category; these include -

      o Operation below 0 degrees C.
      o High discharge rates (above 5C) if not specifically designed for such
        use.
      o Inadequate charging time or a defective charger.
      o One or more defective or worn-out cells. They do not last forever.

To close with a quote from the GE note:

     "To recap, we can say that true 'memory' is exceedingly rare. When we
     see poor battery performance attributed to 'memory', it is almost always
     certain to be a correctable application problem. Of the...problems noted
     above, Voltage Depression is the one most often mistaken for
     'memory'.....

     This information should dispel many of the myths that exaggerate the
     idea of a 'memory' phenomenon."

@node 10.8 "Care and feeding of NiCds"

Here are six guidelines to follow which will hopefully avoid voltage
depression or the memory effect or whatever:

(Portions of the following guidelines are from the NiCd FAQ written by: Ken
A. Nishimura (KO6AF))

  1. DON'T deliberately discharge the batteries to avoid memory. You risk
     reverse charging one or more cell which is a sure way of killing them.

  2. DO let the cells discharge to 1.0V/cell on occasion through normal use.

  3. DON'T leave the cells on trickle charge for long times, unless voltage
     depression can be tolerated.

  4. DO protect the cells from high temperature both in charging and storage.

  5. DON'T overcharge the cells. Use a good charging technique. With most
     inexpensive equipment, the charging circuits are not intelligent and
     will not terminate properly - only charge for as long as recommended in
     the user manual.

  6. DO choose cells wisely. Sponge/foam plates will not tolerate high
     charge/discharge currents as well as sintered plate. Of course, it is
     rare that this choice exists.

@node 10.9 "NiCd battery pack will not hold a charge"

This applies if the pack appears to charge normally and the terminal voltage
immediately after charging is at least 1.2 x n where n is the number of cells
in the pack but after a couple of days, the terminal voltage has dropped
drastically. For example, a 12 V pack reads only 6 V 48 hours after charging
without being used.

What is most likely happening is that several of the NiCd cells have high
leakage current and drain themselves quite rapidly. If they are bad enough,
then a substantial fraction of the charging current itself is being wasted so
that even right after charging, their capacity is less than expected.
However, in many cases, the pack will deliver close to rated capacity if used
immediately after charging.

If the pack is old and unused or abused (especially, it seems, if it is a
fast recharge type of pack), this is quite possible. The cause is the growth
of fine metallic whiskers called dendrites that partially shorts the cell(s).
If severe enough, a dead short is created and no charge at all is possible.

Sometimes this can be repaired temporarily at least by 'zapping' using a
large charged capacitor to blow out the whiskers or dendrites that are
causing the leakage (on a cell-by-cell basis) but my success on these types
of larger or high charge rate packs such as used in laptop computers or
camcorders has been less than spectacular.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.9.1 "What is this thing in my NiCd battery pack?"

In addition to the NiCd cells, you will often find one or more small parts
that are generally unrecognizable. Normally, you won't see these until you
have a problem and, ignoring all warnings, open the pack.

If it is a little rectangular silver box in series with one of the positive
or negative terminals of the pack, it is probably a thermostat and is there
to shut down the charging or discharging if the temperature of the pack rises
too high. If it tests open at room temperature, it is bad. With care, you can
safely substitute a low value resistor or auto tail light bulb and see if the
original problem goes away or at least the behavior changes. However, if
there is a dead short somewhere, that device may have sacrificed its life to
protect your equipment or charger and going beyond this (like shorting it out
entirely) should be done with extreme care.

If it looks like a small diode or resistor, it could be a temperature sensing
thermistor which is used by the charger to determine that the cells are
heating which in its simple minded way means the cells are being overcharged
and it is should quit charging them. You can try using a resistor in place of
the thermistor to see if the charger will now cooperate. Try a variety of
values while monitoring the current or charge indicators. However, the
problem may actually be in the charger controller and not the thermistor. The
best approach is to try another pack.

It could be any of a number of other possible components but they all serve a
protective and/or charge related function.

Of course, the part may be bad due to a fault in the charger not shutting
down or not properly limiting the current as well.

@node 10.10 "Zapping NiCds to clear shorted cells"

Nickel-Cadmium batteries that have shorted cells can sometimes be rejuvenated
- at least temporarily - by a procedure affectionately called 'zapping'.

The cause of these bad NiCd cells is the formation of conductive filaments
called whiskers or dendrites that pierce the separator and short the positive
and negative electrodes of the cell. The result is either a cell that will
not take a charge at all or which self discharges in a very short time. A
high current pulse can sometimes vaporize the filament and clear the short.

The result may be reliable particularly if the battery is under constant
charge (float service) and/or is never discharged fully. Since there are
still holes in the separator, repeated shorts are quite likely especially if
the battery is discharged fully which seems to promote filament formation,

I have used zapping with long term reliability (with the restrictions
identified above) on NiCds for shavers, Dust Busters, portable phones, and
calculators.

WARNING: There is some danger in the following procedures as heat is
generated. The cell may explode! Take appropriate precautions and don't
overdo it. If the first few attempts do not work, dump the battery pack.

ATTEMPT ZAPPING AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!

You will need a DC power supply and a large capacitor - one of those 70,000
uF 40 V types used for filtering in multimegawatt geek type automotive audio
systems, for example. A smaller capacitor can be tried as well.

Alternatively, a you can use a 50-100 A 5 volt power supply that doesn't mind
(or is protected against) being overloaded or shorted.

Some people recommend the use of a car battery for NiCd zapping. DO NOT be
tempted - there is nearly unlimited current available and you could end with
a disaster including the possible destruction of that battery, your NiCd,
you, and anything else that is in the vicinity.

OK, you have read the warnings:

Remove the battery pack from the equipment. Gain access to the shorted
cell(s) by removing the outer covering or case of the battery pack and test
the individual cells with a multimeter. Since you likely tried charging the
pack, the good cells will be around 1.2 V and the shorted cells will be
exactly 0 V. You must perform the zapping directly across each shorted cell
for best results.

Connect a pair of heavy duty clip leads - #12 wire would be fine - directly
across the first shorted cell. Clip your multimeter across the cell as well
to monitor the operation. Put it on a high enough scale such that the full
voltage of your power supply or capacitor won't cause any damage to the
multimeter.

WEAR YOUR EYE PROTECTION!!!

  1. Using the large capacitor:

     Charge the capacitor from a current limited 12-24 V DC power supply.

     Momentarily touch the leads connected across the shorted cell to the
     charged capacitor. There will be sparks. The voltage on the cell may
     spike to a high value - up to the charged voltage level on the
     capacitor. The capacitor will discharge almost instantly.

  2. Using the high current power supply:

     Turn on the supply.

     Momentarily touch the leads connected across the shorted cell to the
     power supply output. There will be sparks. DO NOT maintain contact for
     more than a couple of seconds. The NiCd may get warm! While the power
     supply is connected, the voltage on the cell may rise to anywhere up to
     the supply voltage.

Now check the voltage on the (hopefully previously) shorted cell.

If the filaments have blown, the voltage on the cell should have jumped to
anywhere from a few hundred millivolts to the normal 1 V of a charged NiCd
cell. If there is no change or if the voltage almost immediately decays back
to zero, you can try zapping couple more times but beyond this is probably
not productive.

If the voltage has increased and is relatively stable, immediately continue
charging the repaired cell at the maximum SAFE rate specified for the battery
pack. NOTE: if the other cells of the battery pack are fully charged as is
likely if you had attempted to charge the pack, don't put the entire pack on
high current charge as this will damage the other cells through overcharging.

One easy way is to use your power supply with a current limiting resistor
connected just to the cell you just zapped. A 1/4 C rate should be safe and
effective but avoid overcharging. Then trickle charge at the 1/10 C rate for
several hours. (C here is the amp-hour capacity of the cell. Therefore, a
1/10 C rate for a 600 mA NiCd is 50 mA.)

This works better on small cells like AAs than on C or D cells since the
zapping current requirement is lower. Also, it seems to be nearly impossible
to reliably restore the quick charge type battery packs in portable tools and
laptop computers that have developed shorted cells.

@endnode
@node 10.11 "Identifying technology of unmarked battery packs"

Since the nominal (rated) voltages for the common battery technologies
differ, it is often possible to identify which type is inside a pack by the
total output voltage:

NiCd packs will be a multiple of 1.2 V (1.25V/cell fully charged) Lead-acid
packs will be a multiple of 2.0 V (2.1 V/cell fully charged) Alkaline packs
will be a multiple of 1.5 (1.57 V/cell new).

Therefore, it is generally easy to tell what kind of technology is inside a
pack even if the type is not marked as long as the voltage is. Of course,
there are some - like 6 V that are ambiguous.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.12 "Problems with battery operated equipment"

For primary batteries like Alkalines, first try a fresh set. For NiCds, test
across the battery pack after charging overnight (or as recommended by the
manufacturer of the equipment). The voltage should be 1.2 x n V where n is
the number of cells in the pack. If it is much lower - off by a multiple of
1.2 V, one or more cells is shorted and will need to be replaced or you can
attempt zapping it to restore the shorted cells. See the section:
@{"Zapping NiCds to clear shorted cells" link "10.10"} Attempt at your own risk!

If the voltage drops when the device is turned on or the batteries are
installed - and the batteries are known to be good - then an overload may be
pulling the voltage down.

Assuming the battery is putting out the proper voltage, then a number of
causes are possible:

  1. Corroded contacts or bad connections in the battery holder.

  2. Bad connections or broken wires inside the device.

  3. Faulty regulator in the internal power supply circuits. Test
     semiconductors and IC regulators.

  4. Faulty DC-DC invertor components. Test semiconductors and other
     components.

  5. Defective on/off switch (!!) or logic problem in power control.

  6. Other problems in the internal circuitry.

@endnode
@node 10.13 "Battery juice and corroded contacts"

Unless you have just arrived from the other side of the galaxy (where such
problems do not exist), you know that so-called 'leak-proof' batteries
sometimes leak. This is a lot less common with modern technologies than with
the carbon-zinc cells of the good old days, but still can happen. It is
always good advice to remove batteries from equipment when it is not being
used for an extended period of time. Dead batteries also seem to be more
prone to leakage than fresh ones (in some cases because the casing material
is depleted in the chemical reaction which generates electricity and thus
gets thinner or develops actual holes).

In most cases, the actual stuff that leaks from a battery is not 'battery
acid' but rather some other chemical. For example, alkaline batteries are so
called because their electrolyte is an alkaline material - just the opposite
in reactivity from an acid. Usually it is not particularly reactive (but
isn't something you would want to eat).

The exception is the lead-acid type where the liquid inside is sulfuric acid
of varying degrees of strength depending on charge. This is nasty and should
be neutralized with an alkaline material like baking soda before being
cleaned up. Fortunately, these sealed lead-acid battery packs rarely leak
(though I did find one with a scary looking bulging case, probably due to
overcharging - got rid of that is a hurry).

Scrape dried up battery juice from the battery compartment and contacts with
a plastic or wooden stick and/or wipe any liquid up first with a dry paper
towel. Then use a damp paper towel to pick up as much residue as possible.
Dispose of the dirty towels promptly.

If the contacts are corroded, use fine sandpaper or a small file to remove
the corrosion and brighten the metal. Do not an emery board or emery paper or
steel wool as any of these will leave conductive particles behind which will
be difficult to remove. If the contacts are eaten through entirely, you will
have to improvise alternate contacts or obtain replacements. Sometimes the
corrosion extends to the solder and circuit board traces as well and some
additional repairs may be needed - possible requiring disassembly to gain
access to the wiring.

@node 10.14 "Automotive power"

While it is tempting to want to use your car's battery as a power source for
small portable appliances, audio equipment, and laptop computers, beware: the
power available from your car's electrical system is not pretty. The voltage
can vary from 9 (0 for a dead battery) to 15 V under normal conditions and
much higher spikes or excursions are possible. Unless the equipment is
designed specifically for such power, you are taking a serious risk that it
will be damaged or blown away.

Furthermore, there is essentially unlimited current available from the
battery (cigarette lighter) - 20 A or more. This will instantly turn your
expensive CD player to toast should you get the connections wrong. No amount
of internal protection can protect equipment from fools.

My recommendation for laptop computers is to use a commercially available
DC-AC invertor with the laptop's normal AC power pack. This is not the most
efficient but is the safest and should maintain the laptop's warranty should
something go wrong. For CD players and other audio equipment, only use
approved automotive adapters.

@node 11.2 "Incandescent light bulbs - single and three way"

The basic incandescent lamp operates on the same basic principles as the
original carbon filament lamp developed by Thomas Edison. However, several
fundamental changes have made it somewhat more efficient and robust.

Tungsten replaced carbon as the filament material once techniques for working
this very brittle metal were perfected (Edison knew about tungsten but had no
way of forming it into fine wire). Most light bulbs are now filled with an
inert gas rather than containing a vacuum like Edison's originals. This
serves two purposes: it reduces filament evaporation and thus prolongs bulb
life and reduces bulb blackening and it allows the filament to operate at a
higher temperature and thus improves color and brightness. However, the gas
conducts heat away so some additional power is wasted to heating the
surroundings.

Incandescent lamps come in all sizes from a fraction of a watt type smaller
than a grain of wheat to a 75 KW monsters bulbs. In the home, the most common
bulbs for lighting purposes are between 4 W night light bulbs and 250-300 W
torch bulbs (floor standing pole lamps directing light upwards). For general
use, the 60, 75, and 100 W varieties are most common. Recently, 55, 70 and 95
W 'energy saving' bulbs have been introduced. However, these are just a
compromise between slightly reduced energy use and slightly less light. My
recommendation: use compact fluorescents to save energy if these fit your
needs. Otherwise, use standard light bulbs.

Most common bases are the Edison medium (the one we all know and love) and
the candelabra (the smaller style for night lights, chandeliers, and wall
sconces.

Three-way bulbs include two filaments. The three combinations of which
filaments are powered result in low, medium, and high output. A typical 3-way
bulb might be 50 (1), 100 (2), and 150 (1+2) W. If either of the filaments
blows out, the other may still be used as a regular bulb. Unfortunately,
3-way bulbs do tend to be much more expensive than ordinary light bulbs.
There may be adapters to permit a pair of normal bulbs to be used in a 3-way
socket - assuming the space exists to do this safely (without scorching the
shade).

The base of a 3-way bulb has an additional ring to allow contact to the
second filament. Inexpensive 3-way sockets (not to be confused with 3-way
wall switches for operation of a built-in fixture from two different
locations) allow any table lamp to use a 3-way bulb.

Flashlight bulbs are a special category which are generally very small and
run on low voltage (1.5-12 V). They usually have a filament which is fairly
compact, rugged, and accurately positioned to permit the use of a reflector
or lens to focus the light into a fixed or variable width beam. These usually
use a miniature screw or flange type base although many others are possible.
When replacing a flashlight bulb, you must match the new bulb to the number
and type of battery cells in your flashlight.

Automotive bulbs are another common category which come in a variety of
shapes and styles with one or two filaments. Most now run on 12 V.

Other common types of incandescent bulbs: colored, tubular, decorative,
indoor and outdoor reflector, appliance, ruggedized, high voltage (130 V).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.3 "Why do my light bulbs seem to burn out at warp speed?"

The lifespan of an average incandescent bulb is 750-1000 hours which is about
1.5 months if left on continuously or roughly 4 months if used 8 hours a day.
So, if you are seeing a 3-4 month lifespan, this may not be that out of line
depending on usage. With a lot of bulbs in a house, you may just think you
are replacing bulbs quite often.

Having said that, several things can shorted lamp life:

  1. Higher than normal voltage - the lifespan decreases drastically for
     slight increases in voltage (though momentary excursions to 125 V, say,
     should not be significant).

  2. Vibration - what is the fixture mounted in, under, or on?

  3. High temperatures - make sure you are not exceeding the maximum
     recommended. wattage for your fixture(s).

  4. Bad switches bad connections due to voltage fluctuations. If jiggling or
     tapping the switch causes the light to flicker, this is a definite
     possibility. Repeated thermal shock may weaken and blow the filament.

A bad neutral connection at your electrical service entrance could result in
certain circuits in your house having a higher voltage than normal -
multimeter would quickly identify any.

It may be possible to get your power company to put a recording voltmeter on
your line to see if there are regular extended periods of higher than normal
voltage - above 120 to 125 V.

To confirm that the problem is real, label the light bulbs with their date
(and possibly place of purchase or batch number - bad light bulbs are also a
possibility). An indelible marker should be satisfactory.

Of course, consider using compact or ordinary fluorescent lamps where
appropriate. Use higher voltage (130 V) bulbs in hard to reach places. Bulbs
with reinforced filament supports ('tuff bulbs') are also available where
vibration is a problem.

@endnode
@node 11.4 "Halogen bulbs"

(From: Don Klipstein (don@misty.com)).

A halogen bulb is an ordinary incandescent bulb, with a few modifications.
The fill gas includes traces of a halogen, often but not necessarily iodine.
The purpose of this halogen is to return evaporated tungsten to the filament.

As tungsten evaporates from the filament, it usually condenses on the inner
surface of the bulb. The halogen is chemically reactive, and combines with
this tungsten deposit on the glass to produce tungsten halides, which
evaporate fairly easily. When the tungsten halide reaches the filament, the
intense heat of the filament causes the halide to break down, releasing
tungsten back to the filament.

This process, known as the halogen cycle, extends the life of the filament
somewhat. Problems with uneven filament evaporation and uneven deposition of
tungsten onto the filament by the halogen cycle do occur, which limits the
ability of the halogen cycle to prolong the life of the bulb. However, the
halogen cycle keeps the inner surface of the bulb clean. This lets halogen
bulbs stay close to full brightness as they age. (recall how blackened an
ordinary incandescent bulb can become near the end of its life --- sam).

In order for the halogen cycle to work, the bulb surface must be very hot,
generally over 250 degrees Celsius (482 degrees Fahrenheit). The halogen may
not adequately vaporize or fail to adequately react with condensed tungsten
if the bulb is too cool. This means that the bulb must be small and made of
either quartz or a high-strength, heat-resistant grade of glass known as
"hard glass".

Since the bulb is small and usually fairly strong, the bulb can be filled
with gas to a higher pressure than usual. This slows down the evaporation of
the filament. In addition, the small size of the bulb sometimes makes it
economical to use premium fill gases such as krypton and xenon instead of the
cheaper argon. The higher pressure and better fill gases can extend the life
of the bulb and/or permit a higher filament temperature that results in
higher efficiency. Any use of premium fill gases also results in less heat
being conducted from the filament by the fill gas, meaning more energy leaves
the filament by radiation, meaning a slight improvement in efficiency.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.5 "Efficiency, lifetime, and failure modes of halogen bulbs"

A halogen bulb is often 10 to 20 percent more efficient than an ordinary
incandescent bulb of similar voltage, wattage, and life expectancy. Halogen
bulbs may also have two to three times as long a lifetime as ordinary bulbs,
sometimes also with an improvement in efficiency of up to 10 percent. How
much the lifetime and efficiency are improved depends largely on whether a
premium fill gas (usually krypton, sometimes xenon) or argon is used.

Halogen bulbs usually fail the same way that ordinary incandescent bulbs do,
usually from melting or breakage of a thin spot in an aging filament.

Thin spots can develop in the filaments of halogen bulbs, since the filaments
can evaporate unevenly and the halogen cycle does redeposit evaporated
tungsten in a perfect, even manner nor always in the parts of the filament
that have evaporated the most. However, there are additional failure modes
which result in similar kinds of filament degradation.

It is generally not a good idea to touch halogen bulbs, especially the more
compact, hotter-running quartz ones. Organic matter and salts are not good
for hot quartz. Organic matter such as grease can carbonize, leaving a dark
spot that absorbs radiation from the filament and becomes excessively hot.
Salts and alkaline materials (such as ash) can sometimes "leach" into hot
quartz, which typically weakens the quartz, since alkali and alkaline earth
metal ions are slightly mobile in hot glasses and hot quartz. Contaminants
may also cause hot quartz to crystalize, weakening it. Any of these
mechanisms can cause the bulb to crack or even violently shatter. For this
reason, halogen bulbs should only be operated within a suitable fully
enclosed fixture. If a quartz halogen bulb is touched, it should be cleaned
with alcohol to remove any traces of grease. Traces of salt will also be
removed if the alcohol has some water in it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.6 "Use of dimmers with halogen bulbs"

Dimming a halogen bulb, like dimming any other incandescent lamp, greatly
slows down the formation of thin spots in the filament due to uneven filament
evaporation. However, "necking" of the ends of the filament remains a
problem. If you dim halogen lamps, you may need "soft-start" devices in order
to achieve a major increase in bulb life.

Another problem with dimming of halogen lamps is the fact that the halogen
cycle works best with the bulb and filament at or near specific optimum
temperatures. If the bulb is dimmed, the halogen may fail to "clean" the
inner surface of the bulb. Or, tungsten halide that results may fail to
return tungsten to the filament.

Halogen bulbs should work normally at voltages as low as 90 percent of what
they were designed for. If the bulb is in an enclosure that conserves heat
and a "soft-start" device is used, it will probably work well at even lower
voltages, such as 80 percent or possibly 70 percent of its rated voltage.

Dimmers can be used as soft-start devices to extend the life of any
particular halogen bulbs that usually fail from "necking" of the ends of the
filament. The bulb can be warmed up over a period of a couple of seconds to
avoid overheating of the "necked" parts of the filament due to the current
surge that occurs if full voltage is applied to a cold filament. Once the
bulb survives starting, it is operated at full power or whatever power level
optimizes the halogen cycle (usually near full power).

The dimmer may be both "soft-starting" the bulb and operating it at slightly
reduced power, a combination that often improves the life of halogen bulbs.
Many dimmers cause some reduction in power to the bulb even when they are set
to maximum.

(A suggestion from someone who starts expensive medical lamps by turning up a
dimmer and reports major success in extending the life of expensive special
bulbs from doing this.)

(From: Susanne Shavelson (shavelson@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)).

People have often mentioned experiencing epidemics of light-bulb-death after
moving into a new (to them) house. The same thing happened to us for a few
months after moving last year into a 55-year-old house. After most of the
bulbs had been replaced, things settled down. I am persuaded by the theory
advanced by David (?) Owen in his wonderfully informative and witty book "The
Walls Around Us" that houses undergo a sort of nervous breakdown when a new
occupant moves in, leading to all sorts of symptoms like blown bulbs,
plumbing problems, cracks in the walls, and so forth. Now that the house has
become more accustomed to us, the rate at which strange phenomena are

@node 11.8 "Notes on bulb savers"

These are usually either Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermisters
or simple diodes.

When cold, NTC thermisters have a high resistance. As they warm up, the
resistance decreases so that the current to the light bulb is ramped up
gradually rather than being applied suddenly.

With a properly selected (designed) thermistor, I would not expect the light
output to be affected substantially. However, while reducing the power on
surge may postpone the death of the bulb, the filament wear mechanism is due
to evaporation and redeposition of the tungsten during normal operation. This
is mostly a function of the temperature of the filament.

A thermistor which was not of low enough hot resistance would be dissipating
a lot of power - roughly .8 W/volt of drop for a 100W bulb. Any really
substantial increase in bulb life would have to be due to this drop in
voltage and not the power-on surge reduction. The bulb saver (and socket)
would also be heating significantly.

The bulb savers that are simply diodes do not have as much of a heat
dissipation problem but reduce the brightness substantially since the bulbs
are running at slightly over half wattage. Not surprisingly, the life does
increase by quite a bit. However, they are less efficient at producing light
at the lower wattage and it is more orange. If you are tempted to then use a
higher wattage bulb to compensate, you will ultimately pay more than enough
in additional electricity costs to make up for the longer lived bulbs.

My recommendation: use high efficiency fluorescents where practical. Use 130
V incandescents if needed in hard to reach places where bulb replacement is a
pain. Stay away from bulb savers, green plugs, and other similar products
claiming huge energy reduction. Your realized savings for these products will
rarely approach the advertised claims and you risk damage to your appliances
with some of these.

@node 11.9 "Can you prove that bulb savers do not work"

No, sorry, I don't have conclusive proof. I would love to be proved wrong - I
could save a lot on light bulbs. However, new bulbs do not fail upon power
on.  Old bulbs do. If you examine the filament of a well worn light bulb, you
will see a very distinct difference in surface appearance compared to a brand
new one. The surface has gone from smooth to rough. This change is caused by
sustained operation at normal light bulb temperatures resulting in unequal
evaporation of the filament.

Reducing the power on surge with a thermistor will reduce the mechanical
shock which will postpone the eventual failure. 5X or even 20 % increase in
life is pushing it IMHO.

I do believe that Consumer Reports has tested these bulb savers with similar
conclusions (however, I could be mistaken about the kind of bulb savers they
tested - it was quite awhile ago).

@node 12.2 "Fluorescent lamp basics"

The fluorescent lamp was the first major advance to be a commercial success
in small scale lighting since the tungsten incandescent bulb. Its greatly
increased efficiency resulted in cool (temperature wise) brightly lit
workplaces (offices and factories) as well as home kitchens and baths. The
development of the mercury vapor high intensity discharge (HID) lamp actually
predates the fluorescent (the latter being introduced commercially in 1938,
four years after the HID). However, HID type lamps have only relatively
recently become popular in small sizes for task lighting in the home and
office; yard and security area lighting; and light source applications in
overhead, computer, and video projectors.

Fluorescent lamps are a type of gas discharge tube similar to neon signs and
mercury or sodium vapor street or yard lights. A pair of electrodes, one at
each end - are sealed along with a drop of mercury and some inert gases
(usually argon) at very low pressure inside a glass tube. The inside of the
tube is coated with a phosphor which produces visible light when excited with
ultra-violet (UV) radiation. The electrodes are in the form of filaments
which for preheat and rapid or warm start fixtures are heated during the
starting process to decrease the voltage requirements and remain hot during
normal operation as a result of the gas discharge (bombardment by positive
ions).

When the lamp is off, the mercury/gas mixture is non-conductive. When power
is first applied, a high voltage (several hundred volts) is needed to
initiate the discharge. However, once this takes place, a much lower voltage
- usually under 100 V is needed to maintain it.

The electric current passing through the low pressure gases (mainly the
mercury vapor) emits quite a bit of UV (but not much visible light). The
internal phosphor coating very efficiently converts most of the UV to visible
light. The mix of the phosphor(s) is used to tailor the light spectrum to the
intended application. Thus, there are cool white, warm white, colored, and
black light fluorescent (long wave UV) lamps. There are also lamps intended
for medical or industrial uses with a special envelope that passes short wave
UV radiation such as quartz. Some have an uncoated envelope, and emit
short-wave UV mercury radiation. Others have phosphors that convert shortwave
UV to medium wave UV.

(CAUTION: many of these emit shortwave or medium wave UV which is harmful and
should not be used without appropriate protection in an enclosure which
prevents the escape of harmful UV radiation.)

Fluorescent lamps are about 2-4 times as efficient as incandescent lamps at
producing light at the wavelengths that are useful to humans. Thus, they run
cooler for the same effective light output. The bulbs themselves also last a
lot longer - 10,000 to 20,000 hours vs. 1000 hours for a typical
incandescent.  However, for certain types of ballasts, this is only achieved
if the fluorescent lamp is left on for long periods of time without frequent
on-off cycles.

@endnode
@node 12.3 "Fluorescent lamp labeling"

The actual fluorescent tubes are identified by several letters and numbers
and will look something like 'F40CW-T12' or 'FC12-T10'.

So, the typical labeling is of the form FSWWCCC-TDD (variations on this
format are possible):

F
     Fluorescent lamp.
S
     Style - no letter indicates normal straight tube; C for Circline.
WW
     Nominal power in Watts. 4, 5, 8, 12, 15, 20, 30, 40, etc.
CCC
     Color. W=White, CW=Cool white, WW=Warm white, BL/BLB=Black light, etc.
T
     Tubular bulb.
DD
     Diameter of tube in of eighths of an inch. T8 is 1", T12 is 1.5", etc.

For the most common T12 (1.5 inch) tube, the wattage (except for newer energy
saving types) is usually 5/6 of the length in inches. Thus, an F40-T12 tube
is 48 inches long.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.4 "Compact fluorescent bulbs"

The compact fluorescent lamp is actually a fairly conventional fluorescent
tube packaged with an integral ballast (either iron or electronic) in a
standard screw base that can be installed into nearly any table lamp or
lighting fixture.

These types are being heavily promoted as energy savings alternatives to
incandescent lamps. They also have a much longer life - up to 20,000 hours
compared to 750 to 1000 hours for a standard incandescent. While these basic
premises are not in dispute - all is not peaches and cream:

  1. They are often physically larger than the incandescent bulbs they
     replace and simply may not fit the lamp or fixture conveniently or at
     all.

  2. The funny elongated or circular shape may result in a less optimal
     lighting pattern.

  3. The light is generally cooler - less yellow - than incandescents - this
     may be undesirable and result in less than pleasing contrast with
     ordinary lamps and ceiling fixtures. Newer models have been addressing
     this issue.

  4. Some types (usually iron ballasts) may produce an annoying 120 Hz (or
     100 Hz) flicker.

  5. Ordinary dimmers cannot be used with compact fluorescents.

  6. Like other fluorescents, operation at cold temperatures (under 50
     degrees F) may be erratic.

  7. There may be am audible buzz from the ballast.

  8. They may produce Radio Frequency Interference (RFI).

  9. The up-front cost is substantial (unless there is a large rebate): $10
     to $20 for a compact fluorescent to replace a 60 W incandescent bulb!

 10. Due to the high up-front cost, the pay-back period may approach
     infinity.

 11. While their life may be 20,000 hours, a wayward baseball will break one
     of these $10 to $20 bulbs as easily as a 25 cent incandescent.

Nonetheless, due to the lower energy use and cooler operation, compact
fluorescents do represent a desirable alternative to incandescents. Just
don't open that investment account for all your increased savings just yet!

@node 12.5 "Fluorescent fixtures"

The typical fixture consists of:

   o Lamp holder - the most common is designed for the straight bipin base
     bulb. The 12, 15, 24, and 48 inch straight fixtures are common in
     household and office use. The 4 foot (48") type is probably the most
     widely used size. U shaped, circular (Circline(tm)), and other specialty
     tubes are also available.

   o Ballast(s) - these are available for either 1 or 2 lamps. Fixtures with
     4 lamps usually have two ballasts. See the sections below on @{"ballasts" link "12.5.1"}
     The ballast performs two functions: current limiting and providing the
     starting kick to ionize the gas in the fluorescent tube(s).

   o Switch - on/off control unless connected directly to building wiring in
     which case there will be a switch or relay elsewhere. The power switch
     may have a momentary 'start' position if there is no starter and the
     ballast does not provide this function.

   o Starter (preheat fixtures only) - device to initiate the high voltage
     needed for starting. In other fixture types, the ballast handles this
     function.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.5.1 "Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts"

For a detailed explanation, check your library. Here is a brief summary.

A ballast serves two functions:

  1. Provide the starting kick.
  2. Limit the current to the proper value for the tube you are using.

In the old days fluorescent fixtures had a starter or a power switch with a
'start' position which is in essence a manual starter. Some cheap ones still
do use this technology.

The starter is a time delay switch which when first powered, allows the
filaments at each end of the tube to warm up and then interrupts this part of
the circuit. The inductive kick as a result of interrupting the current
through the inductive ballast provides enough voltage to ionize the gas
mixture in the tube and then the current through the tube keeps the filaments
hot - usually. You will notice that a few iterations are sometimes needed to
get the tube to light. The starter may keep cycling indefinitely if either it
or one of the tubes is faulty. While the lamp is on, a preheat ballast is
just an inductor which at 60 Hz (or 50 Hz) has the appropriate impedance to
limit the current to the tube(s) to the proper value.

Ballasts must generally be fairly closely matched to the lamp in terms tube
wattage, length, and diameter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.5.1.1 "Types of iron ballasts"

Instant start, trigger start, rapid start, etc. ballasts include loosely
coupled high voltage windings and other stuff and do away with the starter:

  1. The ballast for a preheat fixture (using a starter or power switch with
     a 'start' position) is basically a series inductor. Interrupting current
     through the inductor provides the starting voltage.

  2. The ballast for an instant start fixture has a loosely coupled high
     voltage transformer winding providing about 500-600 V for starting in
     addition to the series inductor.

  3. The ballast for a rapid start fixture has in addition small windings for
     heating the filaments reducing the required starting voltage to 250-400
     V. Trigger start fixtures are similar to rapid start fixtures.

Starting voltage is either provided by the inductive kick upon interruption
of the current bypassed through the starter for (1) or a high voltage winding
in (2) and (3).

In all cases, the current limiting is provided primarily by the impedance of
the series inductance at 60 Hz (or 50 Hz depending on where you live).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.5.1.2 "Electronic ballasts"

These devices are basically switching power supplies that eliminate the
large, heavy, 'iron' ballast and replace it with an integrated high frequency
inverter/switcher. Current limiting is then done by a very small inductor,
which has sufficient impedance at the high frequency. Properly designed
electronic ballasts should be very reliable. Whether they actual are reliable
in practice depends on their location with respect to the heat produced by
the lamps as well as many other factors. Since these ballasts include
rectification, filtering, and operate the tubes at a high frequency, they
also usually eliminate or greatly reduce the 120 Hz flicker associated with
iron ballasted systems.

I have heard, however, of problems with these relating to radio frequency
interference from the ballasts and tubes. Other complaints have resulted do
to erratic behavior of electronic equipment using infra red remote controls.
There is a small amount of IR emission from the fluorescent tubes themselves
and this ends up being pulsed at the invertor frequencies which are similar
to those used by IR hand held remote controls.

@endnode
@node 12.7 "Fluorescent starter operation"

The starter incorporates a switch which is normally open. When power is
applied a glow discharge takes place which heats a bimetal contact. A second
or so later, the contacts close providing current to the fluorescent
filaments. Since the glow is extinguished, there is no longer any heating of
the bimetal and the contacts open. The inductive kick generated at the
instant of opening triggers the main discharge in the fluorescent tube. off
with the contacts open. If the contacts open at a bad time - current near
zero, there isn't enough inductive kick and the process repeats.

Where a manual starting switch is used instead of an automatic starter, there
will be three switch positions:


OFF:   Both switches are open.
ON:    Power switch is closed.
START: (momentary) Power switch remains closed and starting switch in closed.

When released from the start position, the breaking of the filament circuit
results in an inductive kick as with the automatic starter which initiates
the gas discharge.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.8 "Wiring for rapid start and trigger start fixtures"

Rapid start and trigger start fixtures do not have a separate starter or
starting switch but use auxiliary windings on the ballast for this function.

The rapid start is now most common though you may find some labeled trigger
start as well.

Trigger start ballasts seem to be used for 1 or 2 small (12-20 W tubes).
Basic operation is very similar to that of rapid start ballasts and the
wiring is identical.

The ballast includes separate windings for the filaments and a high voltage
starting winding that is on a branch magnetic circuit that is loosely coupled
to the main core and thus limits the current once the arc is struck.

A reflector grounded to the ballast (and power wiring) is often required for
starting. The capacitance of the reflector aids in initial ionization of the
gases. Lack of this connection may result in erratic starting or the need to
touch or rum the tube to start.

A complete wiring diagram is usually provided on the ballast's case.

Power is often enabled via a socket operated safety interlock (x-x) to
minimize shock hazard. However, I have seen normal (straight) fixtures which
lack this type of socket even where ballast labeling requires it. Circline
fixtures do not need an interlock since the connectors are fully enclosed -
it is not likely that there could be accidental contact with a pin while
changing bulbs.

Below is the wiring diagram for a single lamp rapid or trigger start ballast.
The color coding is fairly standard. The same ballast could be used for an
F20-T12, F15-T12, F15-T8, or F14-T12 lamp. A similar ballast for a Circline
fixture could be used with an FC16-T10 or lamp FC12-T10 (no interlock).

@node 12.9 "Wiring fluorescent lamps to remote ballasts"

For reasonable distances, this should work reliably and be safe provided
that:

  1. This is only attempted with iron ballasts. The fire safety and
     reliability of electronic ballasts that are not in close proximity to
     the lamps is unknown. The ballast may fail catastrophically either
     immediately or a short time later as the circuit may depend on a low
     impedance (physically short) path for stability.

     In addition, there will almost certainly be substantial Radio Frequency
     Interference (RFI) created by the high frequency currents in the long
     wires. The FCC police (or your neighbors) will come and get you! This
     may be a problem with iron ballasts as well - but probably of less
     severity.

  2. Wire of adequate rating is used. The starting voltage may exceed 1 KV.
     Make sure the insulation is rated for at least twice this voltage. Use
     18 AWG (or heavier) gauge wire.

  3. There is no possibility of human contact either when operating or if any
     connectors should accidentally come loose - dangerous line voltage and
     high starting voltage will be present with tubes disconnected.

NOTE: one application that comes up for this type of remote setup is for
aquarium lighting. My recommendation would be to think twice about any
homebrew wiring around water. A GFCI may not help in terms of shock hazard
and/or may nuisance trip due to inductive nature of the ballast (both depend
at least in part on ballast design).

@endnode
@node 12.10 "Problems with fluorescent lamps and fixtures"

In addition to the usual defective or damaged plugs, broken wires in the
cord, general bad connections, fluorescent lamps and fixtures have some
unique problems of their own. The following assumes a lamp or fixture with a
conventional iron (non-electronic) ballast. Always try a new set of
fluorescent tubes and starter (where used) before considering other possible
failures.

  1. Bad fluorescent tubes. Unlike incandescent lamps where a visual
     examination of the bulb itself will often identify a broken filament,
     there is usually no way of just looking at a fluorescent tube to
     determine if it is bad. It may look perfectly ok though burned out
     fluorescents will often have one or both ends blackened. However, a
     blackened end is not in itself an indication of a bad tube.

     Failure of the electrodes/filaments at one or both ends of the the
     fluorescent tube will result in either a low intensity glow or
     flickering behavior. A broken filament in a fluorescent tube used in a
     preheat type fixture (with a starter) will simply result in a totally
     dead lamp as there will be no power to the starter. The best approach is
     to simply try replacing any suspect tubes - preferably both in a pair
     that are driven from a single ballast.

  2. Bad starter (preheat fixtures only). The little starter can may go bad
     or be damaged by faulty fluorescent tubes continuously trying to start
     unsuccessfully. It is a good idea to replace the starter whenever tubes
     are replaced in these types of fixtures.

  3. Defective iron ballast. The ballast may be obviously burned and smelly,
     overheated, or have a loud hum or buzz. Eventually, a thermal protector
     built into most ballasts will open due to the overheating (though this
     will probably reset when it cools down). The fixture may appear to be
     dead. A bad ballast could conceivably damage other parts as well and
     blow the fluorescent tubes. Ballasts for fixtures less than 30 watts
     usually do not have thermal protection and in rare cases catch fire if
     they overheat. Defective fixtures should not be left operating. If the
     high voltage windings of rapid start or trigger start ballasts are open
     or shorted, then the lamp will not start.

  4. Bad sockets. These can be damaged through forceful installation or
     removal of a fluorescent tube. With some ballasts (instant start, for
     example), a switch contact in the socket prevents generation of the
     starting voltage if there is no tube in place. This minimizes the
     possibility of shock while changing tubes but can also be an additional
     spot for a faulty connection.

  5. Lack of ground. For fluorescent fixtures using rapid start of instant
     start ballasts, it is often necessary for the metal reflector to be
     connected to the electrical system's safety ground. If this is not done,
     starting may be erratic or may require you to run your hand over the
     tube to get it to light. In addition, of course, it is an important

@node 12.11 "Why do fluorescent lamps buzz and what to do about it"

The buzzing light is probably a mundane problem with a defective or cheap
ballast. There's also the possibility of sloppy mechanical construction which
lets something vibrate from the magnetic field of the ballast until thermal
expansion eventually stops it.

First check for loose or vibrating sheetmetal parts - the ballast may simply
be vibrating these and itself not be defective.

Most newer fixtures are of the 'rapid start' or 'warm start' variety and do
not have starters. The ballast has a high voltage winding which provides the
starting voltage.

There will always be a ballast - it is necessary to limit the current to the
tube(s) and for starting if there is no starter. In older fixtures, these
will be big heavy magnetic choke/transformer devices - hard to miss if you
open the thing. Cheap and/or defective ones tend to make noise. They are
replaceable but you need to get one of the same type and ratings - hopefully
of higher quality. A new fixture may be cheaper.

The starter if present is a small cylindrical aluminum can, approximately
3/4" x 1-1/2" in a socket, usually accessible without disassembly. It twists
counterclockwise to remove. They are inexpensive but probably not your
problem. To verify, simply remove the starter after the lamp is on - it is
not needed then.

The newest fixtures may use totally electronic ballasts which are less likely
to buzz. WARNING: electronic ballasts are basically switching power supplies
and are may be hazardous to service (both in terms of your safety and the
risk of a fire hazard from improper repair) unless you have the appropriate
knowledge and experience.

@node 12.12 "Replacing fluorescent lamp or fixture components"

Most of these parts are easily replaced and readily available. However, it is
usually necessary to match the original and replacement fairly closely.
Ballasts in particular are designed for a particular wattage, type and size,
and tube configuration. Take the old ballast with you when shopping for a
replacement. There may be different types of sockets as well depending on the
type of ballast you have.

It is also a possible fire hazard to replace fluorescent tubes with a
different wattage even if they fit physically. A specific warning has been
issued about replacing 40 W tubes with 34 W energy saving tubes, for example.
The problem is that the ballast must also be correctly sized for the new
tubes and simply replacing the tubes results in excessive current flow and
overheating of the ballast(s).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.13 "Fluorescent lamps cycling on and off"

This usually means that the tubes associated with one ballast are cycling
with a period in the 5 to 30 minute range.

There is a thermal protector in the ballast which cuts power to the tubes
that it feeds above a certain temperature. It is likely that this is causing
the cycling behavior. The ballast overheats, shuts off, cools down, starts
up, etc. One or more of the following causes are possible:

   o Bad ballast - shorted turns or other fault is causing overheating.

   o Bad tubes - replace them and see how it behaves.

   o High temperature location - did anything change? Is it 110 degrees F in
     the shade (or in the room)?

   o High line voltage - test with a multimeter.

   o Bad starter (preheat fixtures only) - remove the starter with the lights
     on. If the problem goes away, the starter is probably defective.

Can you say 'supply and demand' and 'economies of mass production'. You are
comparing the price of the common F40CW-T12 lamp manufactured by the zillions
and sold in home centers for about $1 with specialty bulbs used in a
relatively few devices like battery powered fluorescent lanterns and makeup
mirrors. These little bulbs may indeed cost up to ten times as much as the
much larger ones.

By any measure of materials and manufacturing cost, the 4 foot bulb is much

@node 13.2 "Gas discharge lamp basics"

Gas discharge lamps are used in virtually all areas of modern lighting
technology including common fluorescent lighting for home and office - and
LCD backlights for laptop computers, high intensity discharge lamps for very
efficient area lighting, neon and other miniature indicator lamps, germicidal
and tanning lamps, neon signs, photographic electronic flashes and strobes,
arc lamps for industry and A/V projectors, and many more.

Unlike incandescent lamps, gas discharge lamps have no filament and do not
produce light as a result of something getting hot (though heat may be a
byproduct). Rather, the atoms or molecules of the gas inside a glass, quartz,
or translucent ceramic tube, are ionized by an electric current through the
gas or a radio frequency or microwave field in proximity to the tube. This
results in the generation of light - usually either visible or ultraviolet
(UV). The color depends on both the mixture of gasses or other materials
inside the tube as well as the pressure and type and amount of the electric
current or RF power.

Fluorescent lamps are a special class of gas discharge lamps where the
electric current produces mostly invisible UV light which is turned into
visible light by a special phosphor coating on the interior of the tube. See
the section: @{"Fluorescent lamps, ballasts, and fixtures" link "12"}

The remainder of this chapter discusses two classes of gas discharge lamps:
low pressure 'neon' tubes used in signs and displays and high intensity
discharge lamps used for very efficient area and directional lighting. An
entire chapter is dedicated to @{"Fluorescent Lamps, Ballasts and Fixtures" link "12"}

@node 13.3 "Neon lights and signs"

Neon technology has been around for many years providing the distinctive
bright glowing signs of commerce of all kinds before the use of colored
plastics became commonplace.

Neon tubes have electrodes sealed in at each end. For use in signs, they are
formed using the glass blower's skill in the shape of letters, words, or
graphics. Black paint is used to block off areas to be dark. They are
evacuated, backfilled, heated (bombarded - usually by a discharge through the
tube at a very high current) to drive off any impurities, evacuated and then
backfilled with a variety of low pressure gasses.

Neon is the most widely known with its characteristic red-orange glow. Neon
may be combined with an internal phosphor coating (like a fluorescent tube)
to utilize neon's weak short-wave UV emissions. Other gas fills may also be
used as well as colored glass or coatings for added flexibility in
determining the tube's color.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.3.1 "Power supplies for neon"

Extremely high voltage power supplies are used to power neon signs. In the
past, this was most often provided by a special current limited HV line
transformer called a neon sign or luminous tube transformer. The output is
typically 6,000 to 15,000 VAC at 15 to 60 mA. One such unit can power 10s of
feet of tubing. This transformer acts as its own ballast providing the high
voltage needed for starting and limiting the running current as well.
WARNING: the output of these transformers can be lethal since even the
limited current availability is relatively high.

As with everything else, the newest neon sign power supplies use an
electronic AC-AC invertor greatly reducing the size and weight (and
presumably cost as well) of these power supplies by eliminating the large
heavy iron transformer.

Small neon lamps inside high-tech phones and such also use solid state
invertors to provide the more modest voltage required for these devices.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.3.2 "Problems with neon"

These fall into two categories:

  1. Power supply - like fluorescent ballasts, the high voltage transformers
     can fail resulting in reduced (and inadequate) voltage or no power at
     all. Since they are already current limited, overheating may not result
     and any fuse or circuit breaker may be unaffected. The use of a proper
     (for safety if nothing else) high voltage meter can easily identify a
     bad transformer.

  2. Neon tubes - these may lose their ability to sustain a stable discharge
     over time as a result of contamination, gas leakage, or electrode damage
     (either from normal wear or due to excessive current). Check for obvious
     damage such as a cracked tube or cracked seals around the electrodes or
     badly deteriorated electrodes. A previously working tube that now will
     not strike or maintain a stable discharge on a known good transformer
     will need to be replaced or rebuilt.

@endnode
@node 13.4 "High intensity discharge (HID) lamp technology"

These have been used for a long time in street, stadium, and factory
lighting. More recently, smaller sizes have become available for home yard
and crime prevention applications. Like other gas discharge lamps, these
types require s special fixture and ballast for each type and wattage. Unlike
fluorescents, however, they also require a warmup period.

There are three popular types:

   o High pressure mercury vapor lamps contain an internal arc tube made of
     quartz enclosed in an outer glass envelope. A small amount of metallic
     (liquid) mercury is sealed in an argon gas fill inside the quartz tube.
     After the warmup period, the arc emits both visible and invisible (UV)
     light. High pressure mercury vapor lamps (without color correction)
     produce a blue-white light directly from their discharge arc. Phosphors
     similar to those used for fluorescent lamps can be used to give these a
     color closer to natural light. (Without this color correction, people
     tend to look like cadavers). Mercury vapor lamps have the longest life
     of this class of bulbs - 10,000 to 24,000 hours. The technology was
     first introduced in 1934 and was the first of the commercially viable
     HID lamps.

   o Metal halide lamps are constructed along similar lines to mercury vapor
     lamps. However, in addition to the mercury and argon, various metal
     halides are included in the gas fill - usually combinations of sodium
     iodide and scandium iodide. The use of these compounds increases the
     luminous efficiency and results in a more pleasing color balance than
     the raw arc of the mercury vapor lamp. Thus, no phosphor is needed to
     produce a color approaching that of a cool white fluorescent lamp.

   o High pressure sodium vapor lamps contain an internal arc tube made of a
     translucent ceramic material (a form of aluminum oxide known as
     "polycrystalline alumina"). Glass and quartz cannot be used since they
     cannot maintain structural strength at the high temperatures (up to 1300
     degrees C) encountered here, and hot sodium chemically attacks quartz
     and glass. Like other HID lamps, the arc tube is enclosed in an outer
     glass envelope. A small amount of metallic (solid) sodium in addition to
     mercury is sealed in a xenon gas fill inside the ceramic arc tube. Some
     versions of this lamp use a neon-argon mixture instead of xenon. Basic
     operation is otherwise similar to mercury or metal halide lamps. High
     pressure sodium vapor lamps produce an orange-white light and have a
     luminous efficiency much higher than mercury or metal halide lamps.

Unlike fluorescent lamps, HID lamps will give full light output over a wide
range of temperatures. This often makes HID lamps more suitable than
fluorescent lamps for outdoor use.

When cold, the metallic mercury or sodium in the arc tube is in its normal
state (liquid or solid) at room temperature. During the starting process, a
low pressure discharge is established in the gases. This produces very little
light but heats the metal contained inside the arc tube and gradually
vaporizes it. As this happens, the pressure increases and light starts being
produced by the discharge through the high pressure metal vapor. A quite
noticeable transition period occurs when the light output increases
dramatically over a period of a minute or more. The entire warmup process may
require up to 10 minutes, but typically takes 3 to 5 minutes. A hot lamp
cannot be restarted until it has cooled since the voltage needed to restrike
the arc is too high for the normal AC line/ballast combination to provide.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.5 "Problems with high intensity discharge lamps"

While HID lamps have a very long life compared to incandescents (up to 24,000
hours), they do fail. The ballasts can also go bad. In addition, their light
output falls off gradually as they age. For some types, light output may drop
to half its original value towards the end of their life.

A lamp which is cycling - starting, warming up, then turning itself off - is
probably overheating due to a bad bulb or ballast. A thermal protector is
probably shutting down the fixture to protect it or the arc is being
extinguished on its own. However, make sure that it is not something trivial
like a photoelectric switch that is seeing the light from the lamp reflected
from a white wall or fence and turning the fixture off once the (reflected)
light intensity becomes great enough!

Sodium lamps often "cycle" when they have aged greatly. The arc tube's
discolorations absorb light from the arc, causing the arc tube to overheat,
the sodium vapor pressure becomes excessive, and the arc cannot be
maintained. If a sodium lamp "cycles", the first suspect is an aging bulb
which should be replaced.

If you have more than one fixture which uses IDENTICAL bulbs, swapping the
bulbs should be the first test. If the problem remains with the fixture, then
its ballast or other circuitry is probably bad. Don't be tempted to swap
bulbs between non-identical fixtures even if they fit unless the bulb types
are the same.

WARNING: do not operate an HID lamp if the outer glass envelope is cracked or
broken. First, this is dangerous because the extremely hot arc tube can quite
literally explode with unfortunate consequences. In addition, the mercury arc
produces substantial amounts of short wave UV which is extremely hazardous to
anything living. The outer glass normally blocks most of this from escaping.
Some lamps are actually designed with fusable links that will open after some
specified number of hours should air enter the outer envelope. Thus, an
undetected breakage will result in the lamp dying on its own relatively
quickly.

@node 14.1 "Small motors in consumer electronic equipment"

A large part of the functionality of modern appliances is based on the use of
motors of one form or another. They are used to rotate, blow, suck, sweep,
spin, cut, grind, shred, saw, sand, drill, plane, time, and control.

Motors come in all shapes and sizes but most found in small appliances can be
classified into 5 groups:

  1. Universal motors - run on AC or DC, speed may be varied easily. Quite
     efficient but use carbon brushes and may require maintenance.

  2. Single phase induction motors - AC, fairly fixed speed except by
     switching, windings, very quiet. Quite efficient and low maintenance.

  3. Shaded pole induction motors - AC, somewhat fixed speed, very quiet, not
     very efficient and low maintenance.

  4. Small permanent magnet DC motors - DC, variable or constant speed, often
     cheaply made, fairly quiet, prone to problems with metal brushes.

  5. DC brushless motors - DC usually, somewhat variable or fixed speed, very
     quiet, low maintenance.

  6. Synchronous timing motors - constant speed absolutely tied to power
     line. The long term accuracy of clocks based on the AC line exceed that
     of most quartz oscillator based time pieces since the ultimate reference
     is an atomic frequency standard.

Each has its advantages and disadvantages. More than one type may be suitable
for any particular application.

@node 14.2 "Universal motors"

The Universal motor is the most common type of high speed motor found in
appliances and portable line operated power tools. Typical uses include
vacuum cleaners, floor polishers, electric drills, routers, and sewing
machines. They are likely to be found anywhere medium power, high speed,
and/or variable speed control are required capabilities. Note that quiet
operation is NOT a feature of these motors. Therefore, they will not often be
found in electronic equipment.

Construction consists of a stationary set of coils and magnetic core called
the 'stator' and a rotating set of coils and magnetic core called the
'armature'. Incorporated on the armature is a rotating switch called a
'commutator'. Connection to the armature is via carbon (or metal) contacts
called 'brushes' which are mounted on the frame of the motor and press
against the commutator. Technically, these are actually series wound DC
motors but through the use of steel laminated magnetic core material, will
run on AC or DC - thus the name universal.

Speed control of universal motors is easily achieved with thyristor based
controllers similar to light dimmers. However, simply using a light dimmer as
a motor speed controller may not work due to the inductive characteristics of
universal motors.

Changing direction requires interchanging the two connections between the
stator and the armature.

This type of motor is found in blenders, food mixers, vacuum cleaners, sewing
machines, and many portable power tools.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.3 "Problems with universal motors"

These motors can fail in a number of ways:

   o Open windings - this may result in a bad spot, a totally dead motor,
     lack of power, or excessive sparking.

   o Shorted windings - this may result in excessive current, severe
     sparking, reduced speed and power, and overheating. The thermal
     protector, fuse, or circuit breaker may trip. Continuing to run such a
     motor may result in a meltdown or burned coils and insulation - i.e., a
     burned out motor.

   o Worn carbon brushes - while these usually last for the life of the
     appliance, this is not always the case. The result could be erratic or
     sluggish operation, excessive sparking, or even damage to the
     commutator.

   o Dry/worn bearings - this may result in a tight or frozen motor or a
     motor shaft with excessive runout. The result may be a spine tingling
     squeal during operation and/or reduced speed and power, and overheating.
     Running such a motor may eventually lead to burnout due to overheating
     from the increased load.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.4 "Testing of universal motors"

Test the field coils for continuity with an ohmmeter. An open winding is bad
and will require replacement of the entire stator assembly unless the break
can be located. Compare the resistance of the two windings - they should be
nearly equal. If they are not, a short in one of the windings is likely.
Again, replacement will be necessary.

An open or shorted armature winding may result in a 'bad spot' - a position
at which the motor may get stuck. Rotate the motor by hand a quarter turn and
try it again. If it runs now either for a fraction of a turn or behaves
normally, then replacement will probably be needed since it will get stuck at
the same point at some point in the future. Check it with an ohmmeter. There
should be a periodic variation in resistance as the rotor is turned having
several cycles per revolution determined by the number of commutator segments
used. Any extremely low reading may indicate a shorted winding. Any erratic
readings may indicate the need for brush replacement or cleaning. An
unusually high reading may indicate an open winding or dirty commutator.
Cleaning may help a motor with an open or short or dead spot.

A motor can be tested for basic functionality by disconnecting it from the
appliance circuit and running it directly from the AC line (assuming it is
intended for 115 VAC operation - check to be sure). CAUTION: series wound
motors can overspeed if run without a load of any kind and spectacular
failure may result due to centrifugal disassembly of the armature due to
excess G forces. In other words, the rotor explodes. This is unlikely with
these small motors but running only with the normal load attached is a
generally prudent idea.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.5 "About commutators and brushes in universal motors"

A commutator is essentially a rotating switch which routes power to the
appropriate windings on the armature so that the interaction of the fixed
(stator) and rotating (armature) magnetic fields always results in a
rotational torque. Power is transferred to the commutator using carbon
brushes in most motors of this type. The carbon is actually in the form of
graphite which is very slippery as well. Despite that fact that graphite is a
relatively soft material, a thin layer of graphite is worn off almost
immediately as the motor is started for the first time and coats the
commutator. After this, there is virtually no wear and a typical set of
carbon brushes can last thousands of hours - usually for the life of the
appliance or power tool.

A spring presses the brush against the rotating commutator to assure good
electrical contact at all times. A flexible copper braid is often embedded in
the graphite block to provide a low resistance path for the electric current.
However, small motors may just depend on the mounting or pressure spring to
provide a low enough resistance.

The typical universal motor will have between 3 and 12 armature windings
which usually means a similar number of commutator segments. The segments are
copper strips secured in a non-conductive mounting. There are supposed to be
insulating gaps between the strips which should undercut the copper. With
long use, the copper may wear or crud may build up to the point that the gaps
between the copper segments are no longer undercut. If this happens, their
insulating properties will largely be lost resulting in an unhappy motor.
There may be excessive sparking, overheating, a burning smell, loss of power,
or other symptoms.

Whenever checking a motor with a commutator, inspect to determine if the
commutator is in good condition - smooth, clean, and adequately undercut. Use
a narrow strip of wood or cardboard to clean out the gaps assuming they are
still present. For larger motors, a hacksaw blade can be used to provide
additional undercutting if needed though this will be tough with very small
ones. Don't go too far as the strength of the commutator's mounting will be
reduced. About 1/32 to 1/16 inch should do it. If the copper is pitted or
worn unevenly, use some extra fine sandpaper (600 grit, not emery cloth or
steel wool which may leave conductive particles behind) against the
commutator to smooth it while rotating the armature by hand.

Since the carbon brushes transmit power to the rotating armature, they must
be long enough and have enough spring force behind them to provide adequate
and consistent contact. If they are too short, they may be unstable in their
holders as well - even to the point of being ripped from the holder by the
commutator causing additional damage.

Inspect the carbon brushes for wear and free movement within their holders.
Take care not to interchange the two brushes or even rotate them from their
original orientation as the motor may then require a break-in period and
additional brush wear and significant sparking may occur during this time.
Clean the brushes and holders and/or replace the brushes if they are broken
or excessively worn.

@node 14.6 "Repairing small universal motors"

Too bad that the Sears lifetime warranty only applies to hand (non-power)
tools, huh?

Which part of the motor is bad? The armature or stator? How do you know? (A
smelly charred mess would probably be a reasonable answer).

Rewinding a motor is probably going to way too expensive for a small
appliance or power tool. Finding a replacement may be possible since those
sizes and mounting configurations were and are very common.

However, I have, for example, replaced cheap sleeve bearings with ball
bearings on a couple of Craftsman power drills. They run a whole lot smoother
and quieter. The next model up used ball bearings and shared the same
mounting as the cheaper sleeve bearings so substitution was straightforward.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.7 "Single phase induction motors"

Where a fixed speed is acceptable or required, the single phase induction
motor is often an ideal choice. It is of simple construction and very robust
and reliable. In fact, there is usually only one moving part which is a solid
mass of metal.

Most of the following description applies to all the common types of
induction motors found in the house including the larger fractional
horsepower variety used in washing machines, dryers, and bench power tools.

Construction consists of a stationary pair of coils and magnetic core called
the 'stator' and a rotating structure called the 'rotor'. The rotor is
actually a solid hunk of steel laminations with copper or aluminum bars
running lengthwise embedded in it and shorted together at the ends by thick
plates. If the steel were to be removed, the appearance would be that of a
'squirrel cage' - the type of wheel used to exercise pet hamsters. A common
name for these (and others with similar construction) are squirrel case
induction motors.

These are normally called single phase because they run off of a single phase
AC line. However, at least for starting and often for running as well, a
capacitor or simply the design of the winding resistance and inductance,
creates the second (split) phase needed to provide the rotating magnetic
field.

For starting, the two sets of coils in the stator (starting and running
windings) are provided with AC current that is out of phase so that the
magnetic field in one peaks at a later time than the other. The net effect is
to produce a rotating magnetic field which drags the rotor along with it.
Once up to speed, only a single winding is needed though higher peak torque
will result if both windings are active at all times.

Small induction motors will generally keep both winding active but larger
motors will use a centrifugally operated switch to cut off the starting
winding at about 75% of rated speed (for fixed speed motors). This is because
the starting winding is often not rated for continuous duty operation.

Speed control of single phase induction motors is more complex than for
universal motors. Dual speed motors are possible by selecting the wiring of
the stator windings but continuous speed control is usually not provided.
This situation is changing, however, as the sophisticated variable speed
electronic drives suitable for induction motors come down in price.

Direction is determined by the relative phase of the voltage applied to the
starting and running windings (at startup only if the starting winding is
switched out at full speed). If the startup winding is disconnected (or bad),
the motor will start in whichever direction the shaft is turned by hand.

This type of motor is found in larger fans and blowers and other fixed speed
appliances like some pumps, floor polishers, stationary power tools, and
washing machines and dryers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.8 "Shaded pole induction motors"

These are a special case of single phase induction motors where only a single
stator winding is present and the required rotating magnetic field is
accomplished by the use of 'shading' rings which are installed on the stator.
These are made of copper and effectively delay the magnetic field buildup in
their vicinity just enough to provide some starting torque.

Direction is fixed by the position of the shading rings and electronic
reversal is not possible. It may be possible to disassemble the motor and
flip the stator to reverse direction should the need ever arise.

Speed with no load is essentially fixed but there is considerable reduction
as load is increased. In many cases, a variable AC source can be used to
effect speed control without damaging heating at any speed.

This type of motor is found in small fans and all kinds of other low power
applications like electric pencil sharpeners where constant speed is not
important. Compared to other types of induction motors, efficiency is quite
poor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.9 "Problems with induction motors"

Since their construction is so simple and quite robust, there is little to go
bad. Many of these - particularly the shaded pole variety - are even
protected from burnout if the motor should stall - something gets caught in a
fan or the bearings seize up, for example.

Check for free rotation, measure voltage across the motor to make sure it is
powered, remove any load to assure that an excessive load is not the problem.

If an induction motor (non-shaded pole) won't start, give it a little help by
hand. If it now starts and continues to run, there is a problem with one of
the windings or the capacitor (if used).

For all types we have:

   o Dirty, dry, gummed up, or worn bearings - if operation is sluggish even
     with the load removed, disassemble, clean, and lubricate with electric
     motor oil. The plain bearings commonly used often have a wad of felt for
     holding oil. A add just enough so that this is saturated but not
     dripping. If there is none, put a couple of drops of oil in the bearing
     hole.

   o Open coil winding - test across the motor terminals with your ohmmeter.
     A reading of infinity means that there is a break somewhere - sometimes
     it is at one end of the coil and accessible for repair. For those with
     starting and running windings, check both of these.

   o Shorted coil winding - this will result in loss of power, speed, and
     overheating. In extreme cases, the motor may burn out (with associated
     smelly byproducts) or blow a fuse. There is nothing that can be done and
     no easy way of testing for winding which is shorted to itself. You can
     (and should) test for shorts between coils and to the frame.

For capacitor run type:

   o A bad capacitor may be the cause of a motor which will not start, has
     limited power, excessive hum, or overheats. A simple test with your
     ohmmeter on the high resistance scale can give some indication of
     whether the capacitor is good. remove at least one lead of the capacitor
     and measure across it. A good capacitor will show an initially low
     reading which will quickly climb to infinity. If there is no low reading
     at all or it remains low, then the capacitor is bad (open or shorted
     respectively). This does not really prove the capacitor is good but if
     the test shows open shorted, it is definitely bad. Substitution is best.

For larger induction motors with centrifugal starting switches:

   o A centrifugal switch which does not activate the starting winding will
     result in a motor that will not start on its own but will run if it is
     rotated initially by hand. A centrifugal switch that does not cut off
     when the motor is up to speed will result in excessive power use,
     overheating, and may blow a line fuse or trip a circuit breaker. These
     are usually pretty simple and a visual inspection (may require
     disassembly) should reveal broken, worn, or otherwise defective parts.
     Check for proper switch contact closing and opening with a continuity
     tester or ohmmeter. Inspect the rotating weights, springs, and the
     sliding lever for damage.

   o Bad rotor - this is somewhat rare but repeated heating and cooling
     cycles or abuse during starting can eventually loosen up the
     (supposedly) welded connections of the copper bars to the end rings. The
     result is a motor that may not start or loses power since the required
     shorted squirrel cage has been compromised. One indication of this would
     be a rotor that is asymmetric - it vibrates or has torque at only
     certain large angular positions indicating that some of the bars are not
     connected properly. Normally, an induction motor rotor is perfectly
     symmetric.

@node 14.10 "Disassembling and reassembling a universal or induction motor"

The description below assumes that the construction is of an enclosure with
an integral stator and brush holder. For those with an internal structural

For the case of induction motors, ignore any comments about brushes as there

Follow these steps to minimize your use of 4 letter expletives:

  1. Remove the load - fan blades, gears, pulleys, etc. If possible, label
     and disconnect the power wiring as well as the motor can them be totally
     removed to the convenience of your workbench.

  2. Remove the brushes if possible. Note the location of each brush and its
     orientation as well to minimize break-in wear when reinstalled. Where
     the brushes are not easily removable from the outside, they will pop
     free as the armature is withdrawn. Try to anticipate this in step (6).
     (Universal motors only).

  3. Confirm that there are no burrs on the shaft(s) due to the set screw(s)
     that may have been there. For motors with plain bearings in particular,
     these will need to be removed to allow the shaft(s) to be pulled out
     without damage to the bushing. For ball bearing motors, the bearings
     will normally stay attached to the shaft as it is removed.

  4. Use a scribe or indelible pen to put alignment marks on the covers so
     that they can be reassembled in exactly the same orientation.

  5. Unscrew the nuts or bolts that hold the end plates or end bells together
     and set these aside.

  6. Use a soft mallet if necessary to gently tap apart the two halves or end
     bells of the motor until they can be separated by hand.

  7. Remove the end plate or end bell on the non-power shaft end (or the end
     of your choice if they both have extended shafts).

  8. Remove the end plate or end bell on the power (long shaft) end. For
     plain bearings, gently ease it off. If there is any resistance, double
     check for burrs on the shaft and remove as needed so as not to damage
     the soft bushing.

  9. Identify any flat washers or spacers that may be present on the shaft(s)
     or stuck to the bushings or bearings. Mark down their **exact** location
     and orientation so that they may be replaced during reassembly. Clean
     these and set aside.

Inspect all components for physical damage or evidence of overheating or
burning. Bad bearings may result in very obvious wear of the shaft or
bushings or show evidence of the rotor scraping on the stator core. Extended
overloads, a worn commutator, or shorted windings may result in visible or
olfactory detected deterioration of wire insulation.

While it is apart, brush or blow out any built up dust and dirt and
thoroughly clean the shaft, bushings, commutator, and starting switch
(present in large induction motors, only).

Relubrication using electric motor oil for plain bearings and light grease
for non-sealed ball/roller bearings. CAUTION: cleanliness is absolutely
critical when repacking bearings or else you will be doing this again very
soon.

Badly worn ball bearings will need replacement. However, this may be better
left to a motor rebuilding shop as they are generally press fit and difficult
to remove and install.

Reassemble in reverse order. If installation of the brushes needs to be done
before inserting the armature, you will need to feed them in spring end first
and hold them in place to prevent damage to the fragile carbon. Tighten the
nuts or bolts evenly and securely but do not overtighten.

@node 14.11 "Small permanent magnet DC motors"

These are constructed like small versions of universal motors except that the
stator field is provided by powerful ceramic permanent magnets instead of a
set of coils. Because of this, they will only operate on DC as direction is
determined by the polarity of the input voltage.

Small PM DC motors are used in battery or AC adapter operated shavers,
electric knives, and cordless power tools.

Similar motors are also used in cassette decks and boomboxes, answering
machines, motorized toys, CD players and CDROM drives, and VCRs. Where speed
is critical, these may include an internal mechanical governor or electronic
regulator. In some cases there will be an auxiliary tachometer winding for
speed control feedback. This precision is rarely needed for appliances.

As noted, direction is determined by the polarity of the input power and they
will generally work equally well in either direction.

Speed is determined by input voltage and load. Therefore, variable speed and
torque is easily provided by either just controlling the voltage or more
efficiently by controlling the duty cycle through pulse width modulation
(PWM).

These motors are usually quite reliable but can develop shorted or open
windings, a dirty commutator, gummed up lubrication, or dry or worn bearings.
Replacement is best but mechanical repair (lubrication, cleaning) is
sometimes possible.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.12 "Problems with small PM motors"

These motors can fail in a number of ways:

   o Open or shorted windings - this may result in a bad spot, excess current
     drain and overheating, or a totally dead motor.

   o Partial short caused by dirt/muck, metal particle, or carbon buildup on
     commutator - this is a common problem in CD player spindle and cassette
     deck motors but not as common a problem with typical appliances.

   o Dry/worn bearings - this may result in a tight or frozen motor or a
     motor shaft with excessive runout. The result may be a spine tingling
     squeal during operation and/or reduced speed and power.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.13 "Testing of small PM motors"

An open or shorted winding may result in a 'bad spot' - a position at which
the motor may get stuck. Rotate the motor by hand a quarter turn and try it
again. If it runs now either for a fraction of a turn or behaves normally,
then replacement will probably be needed since it will get stuck at the same
point at some point in the future.

Check across the motor terminals with an ohmmeter. There should be a periodic
variation in resistance as the rotor is turned having several cycles per
revolution determined by the number of commutator segments used. Any
extremely low reading may indicate a shorted winding. An unusually high
reading may indicate an open winding or dirty commutator. Cleaning may help a
motor with an open or short or dead spot as noted below. Erratic readings may
indicate the need for cleaning as well.

A motor can be tested for basic functionality by disconnecting it from the
appliance circuit and powering it from a DC voltage source like a couple of
1.5 V D Alkaline cells in series or a DC wall adapter or model train power
pack. You should be able to determine the the required voltage based on the
battery or AC adapter rating of the appliance. If you know that the appliance
power supply is working, you can use this as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.14 "Reviving a partially shorted or erratic PM motor"

Dirt or grime on the commutator can result in intermittent contact and
erratic operation. Carbon or metal particle buildup can partially short the
motor making it impossible for the controller to provide enough voltage to
maintain desired speed. Sometimes, a quick squirt of degreaser through the
ventilation holes at the connection end will blow out the shorting material.
Too much will ruin the motor, but it would need replacement otherwise anyway.
This has worked on Pioneer PDM series spindle motors.

Another technique is to disconnect the motor completely from the circuit and
power it for a few seconds in each direction from a 9 V or so DC source. This
may blow out the crud. The long term reliability of both of these approaches
is unknown.

WARNING: Never attempt to power a motor with an external battery or power
supply when the motor is attached to the appliance, particularly if it
contains any electronic circuitry as this can blow electronic components and
complicate your problems.

It is sometimes possible to disassemble the motor and clean it more
thoroughly but this is a painstaking task best avoided if possible. See the
section: @{"Disassembling and reassembling a miniature PM motor" link "14.15"}

@endnode
@node 14.15 "Disassembling and reassembling a miniature PM motor"

NOTE: for motors with carbon brushes, refer to the section:
@{"Disassembling and reassembling a universal or induction motor" link "14.10"}
This procedure below is for those tiny PM motors with metal brushes.

Unless you really like to work on really tiny things, you might want to just
punt and buy a replacement. This may be the strategy with the best long term
reliability in any case. However, if you like a challenge, read on.

CAUTION: disassembly without of this type should never be attempted with high
quality servo motors as removing the armature from the motor may partially
demagnetize the permanent magnets resulting in decreased torque and the need
to replace the motor. However, it is safe for the typical small PM motor
found in appliances and power tools.

Select a clean work area - the permanent magnets in the motor will attract
all kinds of ferrous particles which are then very difficult to remove.

Follow these steps to minimize your use of 4 letter expletives:

  1. Remove the load - fan blades, gears, pulleys, etc. Label and disconnect
     the power wiring as well as the motor will be a whole lot easier to work
     on if not attached to the appliance or power tool. NOTE: polarity is
     critical - take note of the wire colors or orientation of the motor if
     it is directly soldered to a circuit board!

  2. Confirm that there are no burrs on the shaft(s) due to the set screw(s)
     that may have been there. For motors with plain bearings in particular,
     these will need to be removed to allow the shaft(s) to be pulled out
     without damage to the bushing.

  3. Use a scribe or indelible pen to put alignment marks on the cover so
     that it can be replaced in the same orientation.

  4. Make yourself a brush spreader. Most of these motors have a pair of
     elongated holes in the cover where the power wires are connected to the
     commutator. These allow the very delicate and fragile metal brushes to
     be spread apart as the armature is removed or installed. Otherwise, the
     brushes will get hung up and bent. I have found that a paper clip can be
     bent so that its two ends fit into these holes and when rotated will
     safely lift the brushes out of harm's way.

  5. Use a sharp tool like an awl or dental pick to bend out the 2 or 3 tabs
     holding the cover in place.

  6. Insert the brush spreader, spread the brushes, and pull the cover off of
     the motor. If done carefully, no damage will be done to the metal
     brushes.

  7. The armature can now be pulled free of the case and magnets.

  8. Identify any flat washers or spacers that may be present on the
     shaft(s). Mark down their EXACT location and orientation so that they
     may be replaced during reassembly. Clean these and set aside.

Inspect all components for physical damage or evidence of overheating or
burning. Bad bearings may result in very obvious wear of the shaft or
bushings or show evidence of the rotor scraping on the stator core. Extended
overloads, a worn commutator, or shorted windings may result in visible or
olfactory detected deterioration of wire insulation.

Check that the gaps in the commutator segments are free of metal particles or
carbonized crud. Use a sharp instrument like an Exacto knife blade to
carefully clear between the segments. Clean the brushes (gentle!), shafts,
and bushings.

When reassembling, make sure to use your brush spreader when installing the
cover.

@node 14.16 "DC brushless motors"

These are a variation on the small DC motors described above and uses a
rotating permanent magnet and stationary coils which are controlled by some
electronic circuitry to switch the current to the field magnets at exactly
the right time. Since there are no sliding brushes, these are very reliable.

DC brushless motors may be of ordinary shape or low profile - so called
pancake' style. While not that common in appliances yet, they may be found in
small fans and are used in many types of A/V and computer equipment (HD, FD,
and CD drives, for example). Fortunately, they are extremely reliable.
However, any non-mechanical failures are difficult to diagnose. In some
cases, electronic component malfunction can be identified and remedied. Not
that common in appliances but this is changing as the technology matures.

Direction may be reversible electronically (capstan motors in VCR require
this, for example). However, the common DC operated fan is not reversible.

Speed may be varied over a fairly wide range by adjusting the input voltage
on some or by direct digital control of the internal motor drive waveforms.

The most common use for these in appliances are as small cooling fans though
more sophisticated versions are used as servo motors in VCRs and cassette
decks, turntables, and other precision equipment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.17 "Disassembling and reassembling a DC brushless fan"

This is the type you are likely to encounter - modify this procedure for
other types.

  1. Remove the fan from the equipment, label and disconnect the power wires
     if possible.

  2. Remove the manufacturer's label and/or pop the protective plastic button
     in the center of the blade assembly. Set these aside.

  3. You will see an E-clip or C-clip holding the shaft in place. This must
     be removed - the proper tool is best but with care, a pair of fine
     needlenose pliers, narrow screwdriver, dental pick, or some other
     similar pointy object should work. Take great care to prevent it from
     going zing across the room.

  4. Remove the washers and spacers you find on the shaft. Mark down their
     positions so that they can be restored exactly the way you found them.

  5. Withdraw the rotor and blades from the stator.

  6. Remove the washers and spacers you find on the shaft or stuck to the
     bushings. Mark down their positions so that they can be restored exactly
     the way you found them.

For fans with plain bearings, inspect and clean the shaft and the hole in the
bushing using a Q-tip and alcohol or WD40 (see there is a use for WD40!).
Check for any damage. Lubricate with a couple drops of electric motor oil in
the bushing and any felt pads or washers.

For fans with ball bearings, check the bearings for free rotation and runout
(that they do not wobble or wiggle excessively). If bad, replacement will be
needed, though this may not be worth the trouble. These are generally sealed
bearings so lubrication is difficult in any case. On the other hand, they
don't go bad very often.

Reassemble in reverse order.

@endnode
@node 14.18 "Synchronous timing motors"

Miniature synchronous motors are used in mechanical clock drives as found in
older clock radios or electric clocks powered from the AC line, appliance
controllers, and refrigerator defrost timers. These assemblies include a gear
train either sealed inside the motor or external to it. If the motor does not
start up, it is probably due to dried gummed up lubrication. Getting inside
can be a joy but it is usually possible to pop the cover and get at the rotor
shaft (which is usually where the lubrication is needed). However, the tiny
pinion gear may need to be removed to get at both ends of the rotor shaft and
bearings.

These consist of a stator coil and a magnetic core with many poles and a
permanent magnet for the rotor. (In many ways, these are very similar to
stepper motors). The number of poles determines the speed precisely and it is
not easily changed.

Direction is sometimes determined mechanically by only permitting the motor
to start in the desired direction - they will usually be happy to start
either way but a mechanical clutch prevents this (make note of exactly how is
was positioned when disassembling). Direction can be reversed in this manner
but I know of no actual applications where it would be desirable. Others use
shading rings like those in a shaded pole induction motor to determine the
direction of starting.

Speed, as noted, is fixed by construction and for 60 Hz power it is precisely
equal to: 7200/(# poles) rpm. Thus, a motor with 8 poles will run at 900 rpm.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.19 "Disassembling and reassembling a small timing motor"

The best approach is usually replacement. In some designs, just the rotor and
gear unit can be replaced while retaining the stator and coils.

However, if your motor does not start on its own, is sluggish, or squeals,
cleaning and lubrication may be all that is needed. However, to get to the
rotor bearing requires removal of the cover and in most cases the rotor as
well. This may mean popping off a press-fit pinion gear.

  1. Remove the motor from the appliance and disconnect its power wires if
     possible. This will make it a lot easier to work on.

  2. Remove the cover. This may require bending some tabs and breaking an
     Epoxy seal in some cases.

  3. Inspect the gears and shafts for gummed up lubrication. Since these
     motors have such low torque, the critical bearing is probably one for
     the main rotor. If there is any detectable stiffness, cleaning and
     lubrication is called for.

  4. You can try lubricating in-place but this will usually not work as there
     is no access to the far bearing (at the other end of the shaft from the
     pinion gear). I have used a small nail or awl to pop the pinion gear
     from the shaft by gently tapping in the middle with a small hammer.

  5. Withdraw the rotor from the motor.

  6. Identify any flat washers or spacers that may be present on the shaft.
     Mark down their EXACT location and orientation so that they may be
     replaced during reassembly. Clean these and set aside.

Inspect and clean the shaft and bushings. Lubricate with electric motor oil.

Reinstall the rotor and washers or spacers. Then press the pinion gear back
onto the shaft just far enough to allow a still detectable end-play of about
0.25 to .5 mm. Check for free rotation of the rotor and all gears. Replace
the cover and seal with household cement once proper operation has been
confirmed.

@endnode
@node 14.20 "Motor bearing problems"

A dry or worn bearing can make the motor too difficult to turn properly or
introduce unacceptable wobble (runout) into the shaft as it rotates.

Feel and listen for a dry bearing:

The shaft may be difficult to turn or it may turn with uneven torque. A motor
with a worn or dry bearing may make a spine tingling high pitched sound when
it is turning under power. A drop of light machine oil (e.g. electric motor
oil) may cure a dry noisy bearing - at least temporarily.

Runout - wobble from side to side - of a motor shaft is rarely critical in a
small appliance but excessive side-to-side play may result in noise, rapid
bearing wear, and ultimate failure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.21 "Motor noise"

If the noise is related to the rotating motor shaft, try lubricating the
motor (or other suspect) bearings - a single drop of electric motor oil,
sewing machine oil, or other light oil (NOT WD40 - it is not a suitable
lubricant), to the bearings (at each end for the motor). This may help at
least as a temporary fix. In some cases, using a slightly heavier oil will
help with a worn bearing.

For AC motors in particular, steel laminations or the motor's mounting may be
loose resulting in a buzz or hum. Tightening a screw or two may quiet it
down.  Painting the laminations with varnish suitable for electrical
equipment may be needed in extreme cases. Sometimes, the noise may actually
be a result of a nearby metal shield or other chassis hardware that is being
vibrated by the motor's magnetic field. A strategically placed shim or piece
of masking tape may work wonders.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.22 "Finding a replacement motor"

In many cases, motors are fairly standardized and you may be able to find a
generic replacement much more cheaply than the original manufacturer's part.
However, the replacement must match the following:

  1. Mechanical - you must be able to mount it. In most cases, this really
     does mean an exact drop-in. Sometimes, a slightly longer shaft or
     mounting hole out of place can be tolerated. The pulley or other drive
     bushing, if any, must be able to be mounted on the new motor's shaft. If
     this is a press fit on the old motor, take extreme care so as not to
     damage this part when removing it (even if this means destroying the old
     motor in the process - it is garbage anyway).

  2. Electrical - the voltage and current ratings must be similar.

  3. Rotation direction - with conventional DC motors, this may be reversible
     by changing polarity of the voltage source. With AC motors, turning the
     stator around with respect to the rotor will reverse rotation direction.
     However, some motors have a fixed direction of rotation which cannot be
     altered.

  4. Speed - depending on the type appliance, this may or may not be that
     critical. Most induction motors run at slightly under 900, 1800, or 3600
     rpm (U.S., 60 Hz power). DC motor speed can vary quite a bit and these
     are rarely marked.

MCM Electronics, Dalbani, and Premium Parts stock a variety of small DC
replacement motors. Appliance repair shops and distributors may have generic
replacements for larger motors. Junk and salvage yard or your local dump may
actually have what you want for pennies a pound or less!

@node 15.2 "Repairing broken heating elements"

In appliances like waffle irons and toaster ovens, these are usually welded.
This is necessary to withstand the high temperatures and it is cheap and
reliable as well.

However, welding is not normally an option for the doit yourselfer.

I have used nuts and bolts, say 6-32, bolt, wire, washer, wire, washer,
lockwasher, nut. Depending on how close to the actual really hot element it
is, this may work. If you are connecting to the coiled element, leave a
straight section near the joint - it won't get as hot.

The use of high temperature solder or brazing might also work.

The best approach is probably to use high temperature crimp connectors:

(The following from: sad@garcia.efn.org (Stephen Dunbar))

You can connect heating element wires with high-temperature solderless
connectors that are crimped onto the wires. Be sure to get the special
hi-temp connectors; the ordinary kind will rapidly oxidize and fall apart at
high temperatures. If you want to join two wires to each other, you'll need
either a butt splice connector (joins the wires end-to-end) or a parallel
splice connector (the wires go into the connector side-by-side). To fasten a
wire to a screw terminal you can use a ring or spade connector (though as
noted above, a screw, nut, and washer(s) should work fine --- sam). If your
waffle iron has quick disconnect terminals you'll need the opposite gender
disconnect (AKA Faston). These come in both .187" and .250" widths.

Your best bet for getting these connectors in small quantity is probably a
local appliance parts outlet that caters to do-it-yourselfers. If you can't
find what you need there, try Newark Electronics (branches all over the
place). I have an old copy of their catalog which lists SPC Technology
Voltrex Brand High Temperature Barrel Terminals in several styles: ring,
spade, disconnect, and butt splice. The prices were around $10 to $12 per 100
(this catalog is a couple of years old) for wires in the 22-18 or 16-14AWG
size ranges, almost twice that for the heftier wire gauges. (Be sure to
determine the wire gauge of your heating elements so you can get the right
size terminal.)

You can spend a LOT of money on crimp tools, but for occasional light use you
can probably get by with one of those $10 gadgets that crimp, strip & cut
wires, and cut bolts--the sort of thing you'd find in your local home center
or Radio Shack.

@node 15.3 "Phone jack or extension installation or repair"

The phone companies would have you believe that installing or repairing phone
wiring is somewhere between rocket science and nuclear physics in complexity.
In fact:

  1. Installing new jacks consists of two parts: running the wires and
     hooking them up. The only difficulty with running the wires is getting
     between floors. Connecting them is a matter of matching the colors of
     the insulation, stripping, wrapping around screws, and tightening the
     screws. Even if you are color blind, this is not difficult.

  2. Unless you disturb it, phone wiring rarely goes bad - even in old
     houses. Thus, if you have any amount of handyperson ability, paying the
     $2 a month inside wiring insurance is throwing away $24 a year.

  3. Unlike electrical wiring, phone wiring does not have serious safety
     issues associated with it. However, you could get a mild shock from
     touching the red and green - especially if someone were to try calling
     your number at the same time - the ringing voltage is around 90 V. This
     is easily dealt with - put a jumper between the two phone wires where
     they enter your house while you are working on the wiring. This will
     result in an 'off hook' condition - outside callers will get a busy
     signal.

@endnode
@node 15.4 "Taking equipment overseas (or vice-versa)"

When does it make sense to take an appliance or piece of electronic equipment
to a country where the electric power and possibly other standards differ?

For anything other than a simple heating appliance (see below) that uses a
lot of power, my advise would be to sell them and buy new when you get there.
For example, to power a microwave oven would require a 2KVA step down (U.S.
to Europe) transformer. This would weigh about 50 pounds and likely cost
almost as much as a new oven.

There are several considerations:

  1. AC voltage - in the U.S. this is nominally 115 VAC but in actuality may
     vary from around 110 to 125 VAC depending on where you are located. Many
     European countries use 220 VAC while voltages as low as 90 or 100 VAC or
     as high as 240 VAC (or higher?) are found elsewhere.

  2. Power line frequency - in the U.S. this is 60 Hz. The accuracy,
     particularly over the long term, is excellent (actually, for all intents
     and purposes, perfect) - better than most quartz clocks. In many foreign
     countries, 50 Hz power is used. However, the stability of foreign power
     is a lot less assured.

  3. TV standards - The NTSC 525L/60F system is used in the U.S. but other
     countries use various versions of PAL, SECAM, and even NTSC. PAL with
     625L/50F is common in many European countries.

  4. FM (and other) radio station channel frequencies and other broadcast
     parameters differ.

  5. Phone line connectors and other aspects of telephone equipment may
     differ (not to mention reliability in general but that is another
     issue).

  6. Of course, all the plugs are different and every country seems to think
     that their design is best.

For example, going to a country with 220 VAC 50 Hz power from the U.S.:

For electronic equipment like CD players and such, you will need a small step
down transformer and then the only consideration power-wise is the frequency.
In most cases the equipment should be fine - the power transformers will be
running a little closer to saturation but it is likely they are designed with
enough margin to handle this. Not too much electronic equipment uses the line
frequency as a reference for anything anymore (i.e., cassette deck motors are
DC).

Of course, your line operated clock will run slow, the radio stations are
tuned to different frequencies, TV is incompatible, phone equipment may have
problems, etc.

Some equipment like PCs and monitors may have jumpers or have universal
autoselecting power supplies - you would have to check your equipment or with
the manufacturer(s). Laptop computer, portable printer, and camcorder AC
adapter/chargers are often of this type. They are switching power supplies
that will automatically run on anywhere from 90-240 VAC, 50-400 Hz (and
probably DC as well).

WARNING: those inexpensive power convertors sold for international travel
that weigh almost nothing and claim to handle over a kilowatt are not
intended and will not work with (meaning they will damage or destroy) many
electronic devices. They use diodes and/or thyristors and do not cut the
voltage in half, only the heating effect. The peak voltage may still approach
that for 220 VAC resulting in way too much voltage on the input and nasty
problems with transformer core saturation. For a waffle iron they may be ok
but not a microwave oven or stereo system. I also have serious doubts about
their overall long term reliability and fire safety aspects of these
inexpensive devices..

For small low power appliances, a compact 50 W transformer will work fine but
would be rather inconvenient to move from appliance to appliance or outlet to
outlet. Where an AC adapter is used, 220 V versions are probably available to
power the appliance directly.

As noted, the transformer required for a high power heating appliance is
likely to cost more than the appliance so unless one of the inexpensive
convertors (see above) is used, this may not pay.

@node 15.5 "GFCIs and safety ground"

Despite that fact that a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) may be
installed in a 2 wire circuit, the GFCI does not create a safety ground. In
fact, shorting between the Hot and Ground holes in the GFCI outlet will do
absolutely nothing if the GFCI is not connected to a grounded circuit (at
least for the typical GFCI made by Leviton sold at hardware stores and home
centers). It will trip only if a fault occurs such that current flows to a
true ground. If the original circuit did not have a safety ground, the third
hole is not connected. What this means is that an appliance with a 3 prong
plug can develop a short between Hot and the (supposedly) grounded case but
the GFCI will not trip until someone touches the case and an earth ground
(e.g., water pipe, ground from some other circuit, etc.) at the same time.

@endnode
@node 15.6 "Why has my dryer (or other high current) plug/socket burned up?"

This sort of failure is not unusual. The brass (or whatever) corrodes a bit
over time and/or the prongs loosen up. It doesn't take much resistance at 20
or 30 Amps to produce a substantial amount of heat. The hotter it gets, the
more the resistance goes up, heating increases, it loosens more, and so on
until something melts. The power is I*I*R (where I is current and R is the
resistance) so at 20 A, a .1 ohm resistance at the contact results in 40 W -
think of the heat of a 40 W light bulb.

An exact cause would be hard to identify. However, only the plug and
receptacle are involved - this is not a case of an outside cause. Such a
failure will not normally blow a fuse or trip a breaker since the current
does not increase - it is not a short circuit.

It is definitely wise to replace both the plug and receptacle in such cases
since at the very least, the socket has lost its springiness due to the
heating and will not grip well.. Make sure that the prongs on the new plug
make a secure fit with the socket.

On plugs having prongs with a pair of metal strips, spreading them out a bit
will make much better contact in an old receptacle.

In general, if a plug is noticeably warm, corrective action should be taken
as it will likely get worse. Cleaning the prongs (with 600 grit sandpaper)
and spreading the metal strips apart (if possible) should be done first but
if this does not help much, the plug and/or socket should be replaced.
Sometimes, the original heating problem starts at the wire connections to the
plug or socket (even inside molded units) - loose screws, corroded wires, or
deteriorated solder joints.

@node 15.7 "Heat control in electric range surface units"

The typical electric range surface unit has two spiral elements. In older
ranges, they are used in various combinations across the 120 and 240. We have
a GE range like this which has 5 heat settings (and off) for each 'burner'.

Given 2 element and 2 voltages there are 8 possible connection possibilities.
I don't know which 5 my GE range uses.

Newer ranges use a single element or just parallel the two elements and use
variable power control (pulse width modulation or thyristor phase control) to
obtain arbitrary heat levels and/or a thermostat to sense the actual
temperature.

BTW, this GE range is about 46 years old and still going strong (except for
the 1 hour timer which died about 5 years ago.)

(The following experiments from: Mark Zenier (mzenier@netcom.com)).

>From my multiple renovations of my mother's stove of a similar vintage:

Warm is 120 volts applied to both elements of a burner in series.

Low is 120 volts applied to one of the two elements. The burners are wired so
that they are not the same. Half of the burners used the center element, the
others used the rim element. Usually split between front burners and rear.
(This is a GE, other companies used two interleaved spiral elements.)

Third is 120 volts applied to both elements.

Second is 240 volts applied to one element, like Low, it varies from burner
to burner.

High is 240 volts applied to both elements.

The following applies to refrigerators and freezers, air conditioners,
electric space heaters, as well as other small appliances.

Removing the thermostat (unplug AC line first!) and cleaning the contacts
using contact cleaner NOT sandpaper or a file - may help temporarily.
Replacement is easy if the cold control is self contained using a bimetal
strip. If it uses a liquid filled bulb, the tube may snake around inside the
cabinet and may be more challenging. Still no big deal. An appliance part
distributor or your appliance manufacturer should have a replacement.

@node 15.9 "Controlling an inductive load with a triac"

Thyristor based controllers need to be designed with inductive loads in mind
or else they may not work correctly or may be damaged when used to control a
motor or even a transformer or large relay.

There are a couple of issues:

  1. Will it switch correctly? Assuming it uses a Triac to do the switching,
     the inductive nature of the load may prevent the current from ever
     turning off. Once it goes on the first time, it stays on.

  2. Inductive kickback. Inductive loads do not like to be switched off
     suddenly and generate a voltage spike as a result of the rapid change in
     current. This may damage the Triac resulting the load staying on through
     the next millennium.

  3. Heating. Due to the inductive load, this will be slightly greater for
     the switch but I wouldn't expect it to be a major issue. However, some
     derating would be advised. Don't try to switch a load anywhere near the
     rated maximum for a resistive load.

Where feasible, adding a light bulb in parallel with the load will decrease
the effect of the inductance. There is no way of knowing whether it will be
effective without analyzing the design or trying it.

Using a relay controlled by the Triac to then switch the inductive load may
work but keep in mind that a relay coil is also an inductive load - a much
smaller one to be sure - but nonetheless, not totally immune to these
effects.

When it should be spinning, is the motor running? Does it complete the cycle

@node 15.11 "Outlet wiring screwed up?"

So your $6 outlet tester displays a combination of lights that doesn't make
sense or one or more lights is dim. For example, all three lights are on but
K and X (see below) are dim.

The three neon bulbs are just between what should be (The first letter is how
the light is marked on mine):


K Hot to Ground (GROUND OK)
O Hot to Neutral (HOT OK?)
X Neutral to Ground (HOT/NEUTRAL REVERSE - should not light)

I suspect at the very least that your ground is not connected at the service
panel. I may run from some/all the outlets but ends somewhere. You are seeing
capacitive/inductive pickup between the floating ground and the other wires
in the circuit. Your N and H may be reversed as well but this cannot be
determined without checking with a load between H/N and a proper ground.

I would recommend:

  1. Determining if the ground wire for those 3 prong outlets does indeed go
     anywhere.

  2. Determining if the Hot and Neutral polarity is correct by testing
     between each of the prongs and a confirmed ground (properly connected 3
     prong outlet, service panel, or a cold water pipe in an all metal water
     system) with a load like a 25 W light bulb. The neon lamps in the tester
     or a high impedance multimeter can be fooled by capacitance and other
     leakage paths.

For a computer or other 3 wire appliance, you should really install a proper
3 prong outlet wired correctly. Otherwise, any power line filters and surge
suppressors will not have the safety ground (which a GFCI does NOT create).
Some UPSs may get away without one but then their surge suppressor and/or
line filters will not work correctly.

Some appliances like microwave ovens MUST have a proper safety ground
connection for safety. This not only protects you from power line shorts to
the case but also a fault which could make the case live from the high
voltage of the microwave generator.

(From: Dan Hicks (danhicks@millcomm.com)).

Most major brands of 12V lights are "sort of" interchangeable. (Occasionally
you have trouble getting the wire from one brand to connect with the fixtures
of another brand, but with a little fudging it can usually be done.) So look
for the brand/model that gives you most of the lights you want in the styles
you want, then augment with add-ons from other brands. Be aware of the
current limit of transformers, though -- some kits have small transformers
not sized for add-ons, while others have quite a bit of excess capacity. I've
got a (mostly) Toro system I'm semi-satisfied with, though the built-in
photocell system has failed twice. (I'm going to install a separate photocell
& timer and just set the transformer to "On".)

This assumes the unit has power and otherwise operates normally. However,
determining this may be difficult if the completion of the cycle is dependent
on a water weight or volume sensor.

There are several possibilities:

  1. The appropriate water inlet filter is clogged. This will be accessible
     by unscrewing the hose connection. Clean it.

  2. The solenoid is bad. If you are electrically inclined, put a multimeter
     on the cold water valve to see if it is getting power.

  3. The temperature selector switch is bad or has bad connections.

  4. The controller is not providing the power to the solenoid (even for only
     hot or cold, these will have separate contacts).

For quite a lot of useful information, do a web search for 'appliance
repair'.  There are a couple of decent sites with DYI information.

(From: Bernie Morey (bmorey@aardvark.apana.org.au)).

I've repaired our electric dryer several times over the years and kept it
going well beyond its use-by date. What you you like to know?

My main problems have been:

  1. Mechanical timer failure. Easy fix.

  2. Leaking steam damaging the element. Have replaced element twice --
     fairly easy job. Had to replace some stainless stand-offs at the same
     time. Elements readily available and equivalent of USD24 each.

  3. Bearing replacement -- have to be done carefully or they don't last.

  4. Belt replacement.

  5. Exhaust fan bearing replacement. This was the trickiest, although far
     from impossible. Is a sealed unit subject to high heat and dust
     contamination -- not a good environment.

The only problem for the past two years has been the dryer throwing the
exhaust fan belt. Cleaning up the fluff fixes it for another year.

Did all these without any guide -- just carefully inspecting the work before
starting and making diagrams of wiring and ESPECIALLY the main drum belt. I
generally have to get my wife to help me with the main belt -- hard to get
the tensioner in position while stopping the belt slipping down the far side
of the drum.

These things are mechanically and electrically pretty simple -- if it's not
working the fault is usually obvious.

@node 15.15 "Mike's notes on ceiling fan installation"

(From: morris@cogent.net (Mike Morris)).

Depending on what wiring you have and what new wiring needs to be installed,
I would install 14/3 cables for all ceiling lights. That way, you will be
able to control ceiling fan and light from two separate switches.

Each time a new light has to be installed in our house, I make sure a 14/3
wire is installed. For three-way switches, I make it two 14/3 wires, even if
I don't install a ceiling fan now. A 14/3 wire is not that much more
expensive, and 10 years down the road, it might be useful.

The local high-end lights-and-fans shops have a handout that recommends that
wherever a ceiling fan is to go have the following wiring:

  1. Neutral

  2. Ground (if local code requires it, good idea anyway)

  3. Switched hot for the lights

  4. Switched hot for the fan

  5. An extra wire - some brands need 2 hots for the fan, and if your brand
     doesn't need it, an extra conductor doesn't hurt.

Why two switched hots?

   o It allows to run the lights and fan separately.

   o You can not use a lamp dimmer as a motor speed control.

Note that this does not preclude using a fan with built-in controls - unused
wire is just that. And pulling in 5 conductors during construction or
remodeling costs just a little more that pulling in 2 or 3.

The handout sheet also point out that adding a extra brace to the ceiling
during any remodeling or new construction sized for a 100 pound dead weight
is a good idea - it can be as simple as a couple of feet of 2x6" lumber and a
couple of sheet metal fasteners. A wobbling fan can cause fatigue in a light
duty metal brace rapidly. The extra cost is minimal, and it can prevent a fan
from landing in the middle of the bed!

@node 15.16 "Checking dishwasher solenoids"

From: filipg@paranoia.com (Filip M Gieszczykiewicz)

Greetings. Well, since it's a moist/damp environment... I'd suspect a bad
connection first. You will need to pop off the front bottom panel and get at
the wires that actually connect the solenoid to the timer motor (and/or wire
harness). You will need an ohmmeter to check the resistance of the coil - if
it's OK (20-200 ohms I would guess), that's not the problem. Well, that
leaves you with pretty much the wires that connect the timer motor (a
MULTI-contact switch driven by a timer motor like those found in old clocks
that plugged into outlets) and the switch itself. I hope the dishwasher is
unplugged... Since the dishwasher operates as a closed system (because of the
"darned" water :-) it will be difficult to test it in circuit. I suggest that
you try to trace the wires that come off the solenoid to their other ends...
and then test the wires themselves. If you feel this is too much for you,
call the repair folks - ask around... see if anyone else knows a particular
service that has a good record...

@node 15.17 "Soldering tabs onto NiCd batteries"

When replacing NiCd batteries in packs or portable tools, it is often
necessary to attach wires to the individual cells. It may be possible to
obtain NiCds with solder tabs attached (Radio Shack has these) but if yours
do not, here are two ways that work. They both require a (Weller) high
wattage soldering gun.

I use a high power Weller (140 W) soldering gun. Use fine sandpaper to
thoroughly clean and roughen up the surface of the battery cell at both ends.
Tin the wires ahead of time as well. Arrange the wire and cell so that they
are in their final position - use a vise or clamp or buddy to do this. Heat
up the soldering gun but do not touch it to the battery until it is hot -
perhaps 10 seconds. Then, heat the contact area on the battery end while
applying solder. It should melt and flow quite quickly. As soon as the solder
adheres to the battery, remove the heat without moving anything for a few
seconds. Inspect and test the joint. A high power soldering iron can also be
used.

Here is a novel approach that appears to work:

(From: Clifford Buttschardt (cbuttsch@slonet.org)).

There is really no great amount of danger spot welding tabs! They usually are
made of pure nickel material. I put two sharp pointed copper wires in a
soldering gun, place both on the tab in contact with the battery case and
pull the trigger for a short burst. The battery remains cool.

(From: mcovingt@ai.uga.edu (Michael Covington)).

Of course! A soldering gun is a source of about 1.5 V at 100 A RMS. Should
make a fine spot-welder. You should write that up for QST ("Hints and Kinks")
or better yet, send it in a letter to the editor of "Electronics Now" (the
magazine I write for).

@node 15.18 "Motor armature testing - or - what is a growler?"

A common fault that cannot always be reliably identified with a simple
ohmmeter test is a couple of shorted turns in the winding that do not affect
the total resistance significantly.

A growler is basically an AC electromagnet exciting the windings in the
armature. A shorted armature winding will act as a the secondary of a
transformer resulting in a high current flow and high induced magnetic field.

Hold a piece of spring steel like a hacksaw blade as a probe over the
armature as you rotate it slowly on the electromagnet. A shorted winding will
show up as a strong audible vibration of the 'probe' - thus the name growler.

@node 15.19 "Effects of brownouts and blackouts on electronic equipment and appliances"

Brownouts down to 100 V, maybe even 90 volts should not affect electronic
equipment. It is possible that there is a no-man's land in between 0 and 90
volts (just an estimate) where strange things may happen. Whether this will
cause permanent damage I cannot say. The surge, spikes, and overvoltage
possibly associated with repeated brownouts or blackouts can damage
electronics, however.

Induction motors - the type in most large appliances - will run hotter and
may be more prone to failure at reduced line voltage. This is because they
are essentially constant speed motors and for a fixed load, constant power
input. Decrease the voltage and the current will increase to compensate
resulting in increased heating.

foul smelling polymer and "dust" Al stock: from thin foil to .080" to .5"

you can see where it goes in, what it moves, what activates it, etc).

If it's something intricate, my parts bin door is NEVER closed.. and it gives
it's "body" to science :-)

If you have part of the old plastic lever, it's usually easy to build up the
broken off part. I like to heat up a segment of piano wire and insert it into
the remaining part in such a way as to hit the most "meat" of the part. Then,
using either epoxy or plastic build up material, I form something that does
the job.

Overall, I have about a 75% "plastic broken part" repair ratio. After a

@node 16.3 "Interchangeability of components"

The question often arises: If I cannot obtain an exact replacement or if I
have another appliance carcass gathering dust, or I just have some extra
parts left over from a previous project, can I substitute a part that is not
a precise match? Sometimes, this is simply desired to confirm a diagnosis and
avoid the risk of ordering an expensive replacement and/or having to wait
until it arrives.

For safety related items, the answer is generally NO - an exact replacement
part is needed to maintain the specifications within acceptable limits with
respect to line isolation (shock prevention) and to minimize fire hazards.
However, these components are not very common in small appliances.

For other components, whether a not quite identical substitute will work
reliably or at all depends on many factors. Some designs are so carefully
optimized for a particular part's specifications that an identical
replacement is the way to return performance to factory new levels. With
appliances in particular, may parts which perform common functions - like
thermostats - utilize custom mounting arrangements which preclued easy
substitution even if the electrical and thermal characteristics are an exact
match.

Here are some guidelines:

  1. Fuses - exact same current rating and at least equal voltage rating. I
     have often soldered a normal 3AG size fuse onto a smaller blown 20 mm
     long fuse as a substitute. Also, they should be the same type - slow
     blow only if originally specified. A fuse with a faster response time
     may be used but it may blow when no faults actually exist.

  2. Thermal fuses and thermal cutouts - exact same temperature and current
     rating (if stated). Physical size may also be important when these are
     buried in motor or transformer windings.

  3. Thermostats - temperature range must be compatible (or slightly wider
     may be acceptable). Electrical current and voltage ratings must meet or
     exceed original. With some devices, hysteresis - the tendency of a
     thermostat that has switched to stay that way until the temperature
     changes by a few degrees - may be an issue. For example, electric
     heaters use a thermostat which has a typical hysteresis of 3-5 degrees
     F. However, heating appliances like waffle irons and slow cookers may
     depend on the thermal mass of the castings and use a thermostat with
     very little hysteresis.
  4. Resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, switches, trimpots, lamps and
     LEDs, and other common parts - except for those specifically marked as
     safety-critical - substitution as long as the replacement part fits and
     specifications are met should be fine.

  5. Rectifiers - use types of equal or greater current and PRV ratings. A
     bad bridge rectifier can be replaced with 4 individual diodes. However,
     high efficiency and/or fast recovery types are used in parts of
     electronic ballasts and other switching power supplies.

  6. Transistors and thyristors (except power supply choppers) - substitutes
     will generally work as long as their specifications meet or exceed those
     of the original. For testing, it is usually ok to use types that do not
     quite meet all of these as long as the breakdown voltage and maximum
     current specifications are not exceeded. However, performance may not be
     quite as good. For power types, make sure to use a heatsink.

  7. Motors - small PM motors may often be substituted if they fit
     physically. Make sure you install for the correct direction of rotation
     (determined by polarity). For universal and induction motors,
     substitution may be possible but power input, speed, horsepower,
     direction of rotation, and mounting need to be compatible.

  8. Sensor switches - some of these are common types but many seem to be
     uniquely designed for each appliance.

  9. Power transformers - in some cases, these may be sufficiently similar
     that a substitute will work. However, make sure you test for compatible
     output voltages to avoid damage to the regulator(s) and rest of the
     circuitry. Transformer current ratings as well as the current
     requirements of the equipment are often unknown, however.

 10. Belts or other rubber parts - a close match may be good enough at least
     to confirm a problem or to use until the replacements arrives.

 11. Mechanical parts like screws, flat and split washers, C- and E-clips,
     and springs - these can often be salvaged from another unit.

The following are usually custom parts and substitution of something from
your junk box is unlikely to be successful even for testing: SMPS (power
supply) transformers, microcontrollers, other custom programmed chips,
display modules, and entire power supplies unless identical.
