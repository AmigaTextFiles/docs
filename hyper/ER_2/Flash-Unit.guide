@node 2.1 "Electronic flash fundamentals"

All modern electronic flash units (often called photographic strobes) are
based on the same principles of operation whether of the subminiature variety
in a disposable pocket camers or high quality 35 mm camera, compact separate
hot shoe mounted unit, or the high power high performance unit found in a
photo studio 'speed light'. All of these use the triggered discharge of an
energy storage capacitor through a special flash tube filled with xenon gas
at low pressure to produce a very short burst of high intensity white light.

The typical electronic flash consists of four parts: (1) power supply, (2)
energy storage capacitor, (3) trigger circuit, and (4) flash tube.

An electronic flash works as follows:

  1. The energy storage capacitor connected across the flash tube is charged
     from a 300V (typical) power supply. This is either a battery or AC
     adapter operated invertor (pocket cameras and compact strobes) or an AC
     line operated supply using a power transformer or voltage doubler or
     tripler (high performance studio 'speed' lights). These are large
     electrolytic capacitors (200-1000+ uF at 300+ V) designed specifically
     for the rapid discharge needs of photoflash applications.

  2. A 'ready light' indicates when the capacitor is fully charged. Most
     monitor the voltage on the energy storage capacitor. However, some
     detect that the invertor or power supply load has decreased indicating
     full charge.

  3. Normally, the flash tube remains non-conductive even when the capacitor
     is fully charged.

  4. A separate small capacitor (e.g., .1 uF) is charged from the same power
     supply to generate a trigger pulse.

  5. Contacts on the camera's shutter close at the instant the shutter is
     fully open. These cause the charge on the trigger capacitor to be dumped
     into the primary of a pulse transformer whose secondary is connected to
     a wire, strip, or the metal reflector in close proximity to the flash
     tube.

  6. The pulse generated by this trigger (typically around 4-10 KV depending
     on the size of the unit) is enough to ionize the xenon gas inside the
     flash tube.

  7. The xenon gas suddenly becomes a low resistance and the energy storage
     capacitor discharges through the flash tube resulting in a short
     duration brilliant white light.

The energy of each flash is roughly equal to 1/2*C*V^^2 in watt-seconds (W-s)
where V is the value of the energy storage capacitor's voltage and C is its
capacitance. Not quite all of the energy in the capacitor is used but it is
very close. The energy storage capacitor for pocket cameras is typically
100-400 uF at 330 V (charged to 300 V) with a typical flash energy of 10 W-s.
For high power strobes, 1000s of uF at higher voltages are common with
maximum flash energies of 100 W-s or more. Another important difference is in
the cycle time. For pocket cameras it may be several seconds - or much longer
as the batteries run down. For a studio 'speed light', fractional second
cycle times are common.

Typical flash duration is much less than a millisecond resulting in crystal
clear stop action photographs of almost any moving subject.

On cheap cameras (and probably some expensive ones as well) physical contacts
on the shutter close the trigger circuit precisely when the shutter is wide
open. Better designs use an SCR or other electronic switch so that no high
voltage appears at the shutter contacts (or hot shoe connector of the flash
unit) and contact deterioration do to high voltage sparking is avoided.

Note that for cameras with focal plane shutters, the maximum shutter speed
setting that can be used (X-Sync) is typically limited to 1/60-1/120 of a
second. The reason is that for higher shutter speeds, the entire picture is
not exposed simultaneously by the moving curtains of the focal plane
mechanism. Rather, a slit with a width determined the by the effective
shutter speed moves in front of the film plane. For example, with a shutter
speed setting of 1/1000 of a second, a horizontally moving slit would need to
be about 1/10 of an inch wide for a total travel time of 1/60 of a second to
cover the entire 1.5 inch wide 35 mm frame. Since the flash duration is
extremely short and much much less than the focal plane curtain travel time,
only the film behind the slit would be exposed by an electronic flash. For
shutter speed settings longer than the travel time, the entire frame is
uncovered when the flash is triggered.

See the @{"schematics" link "6"} sections for typical circuit configurations of both
battery and line powered electronic flash units of various sizes.

Red-eye reduction provides a means of flashing the lamp twice in rapid
succession. The idea is that the pupils of the subjects' eyes close somewhat
due to the first flash resulting in less red-eye - reflected imaging of the
inside of the eyeball - in the actual photograph.

Automatic electronic flash units provide an optical feedback mechanism to
sense the amount of light actually reaching the subject. The flash is then
aborted in mid stride once the proper exposure has been made. This means that
the flash duration will differ depending on exposure - typically from 1 ms at
full power to 20 us or less at close range.

Inexpensive automatic flash units just short across the flashlamp with an SCR
or second internal 'quench' tube (an internal small xenon tube that looks
like an oversize neon indicator lamp) triggered by a photosensor. With these
units, the same amount of energy is used regardless of how much light is
actually required and thus low and high intensity flashes drain the battery
by the same amount - and require the same cycle time. The excess energy is
wasted. Note that it is not the distance to the subject that matters but the
amount of total light energy reflected back to the sensor. The travel time of
the light has nothing to do with controlling exposure.

More sophisticated units use something like a Gate Turnoff Thyristor (GTO) to
actually interrupt the flash discharge at the proper instant. These use only
as much energy as needed and the batteries last much longer since most flash
photographs do not require maximum power. Furthermore, when using low power
flashes, the cycle time is effectively zero since the main energy storage
capacitor does not discharge significantly. Therefore, multiple shots can be
taken in rapid succession.

Failure of red-eye reduction or the automatic exposure control circuits will
probably require a schematic to troubleshoot unless tests for bad connections
or shorted or open components identify specific problems. However, some of
these use fairly simple circuits with mostly standard components and can be
traced without too much difficulty.

Remotely triggered 'fill flashes' use a photocell or photodiode to fire an
SCR (or light activated SCR) which emulates the camera shutter switch closure
for the flash unit being controlled. There is little to go wrong with these
devices.

@node 2.2 "Xenon strobe safety"

There are two potential hazards in dealing with the innards of electronic
flash and other xenon strobe equipment:

  1. The energy storage capacitor. Even on small pocket camera electronic
     flash units, these are rated at 100-400 uF at 330 VDC. This is 5-20 W-s
     which is enough to kill you under the right (wrong?) conditions. Hot
     shoe or side mounted electronic flash units have energy storage
     capacitors which are usually larger - typically 300-1000 uF or more.
     High performance studio speed lights may have 10 times this capacity and
     at much higher voltages resulting in even greater energy storage. Xenon
     strobes for pumping of solid state laser rods and other industrial and
     scientific applications may use many KV power supplies with 1000s of W-s
     energy storage capacitors - touch one of these and you will be but a
     puff of vapor in the wind...

     High voltage with high energy storage is an instantly deadly
     combination. Treat all of these capacitors - even those in tiny pocket
     cameras with respect. Always confirm that they are discharged before
     even thinking about touching anything. On larger systems especially,
     install a shorting jumper after discharging just to be sure - capacitors
     have been known to recover a portion of their original charge without
     additional power input. Better to kill the power supply than yourself if
     you forget to remove it when powering up.

  2. Line connected (no power transformer) have all the dangers associated
     with AC line power in addition to the large power supply and energy
     storage capacitors. Always use an isolation transformer when probing
     line connected systems. However, keep in mind that the power supply
     filter capacitors and energy storage capacitors remain just as deadly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.3 "Safety guidelines"

These guidelines are to protect you from potentially deadly electrical shock
hazards as well as the equipment from accidental damage.

Note that the danger to you is not only in your body providing a conducting
path, particularly through your heart. Any involuntary muscle contractions
caused by a shock, while perhaps harmless in themselves, may cause collateral
damage - there are many sharp edges inside this type of equipment as well as
other electrically live parts you may contact accidentally.

The purpose of this set of guidelines is not to frighten you but rather to
make you aware of the appropriate precautions. Electronic construction,
testing, and troubleshooting can be fun and rewarding and economical.

Just be sure that it is also safe!

   o Don't work alone - in the event of an emergency another person's
     presence may be essential.

   o Always keep one hand in your pocket when anywhere around a powered
     line-connected or high voltage system.

   o Wear rubber bottom shoes or sneakers.

   o Wear eye protection - large plastic lensed eyeglasses or safety goggles.

   o Don't wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact
     circuitry and conduct current, or get caught in moving parts.

   o Set up your work area away from possible grounds that you may
     accidentally contact.

   o Know your equipment: TVs and monitors may use parts of the metal chassis
     as ground return yet the chassis may be electrically live with respect
     to the earth ground of the AC line. Microwave ovens use the chassis as
     ground return for the high voltage. In addition, do not assume that the
     chassis is a suitable ground for your test equipment!

   o If circuit boards need to be removed from their mountings, put
     insulating material between the boards and anything they may short to.
     Hold them in place with string or electrical tape. Prop them up with
     insulation sticks - plastic or wood.

   o If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits with power
     off, discharge (across) large power supply filter capacitors with a 2 W
     or greater resistor of 10-50 ohms/V approximate value (e.g., for a 200 V
     capacitor, use a 2K-10K ohm resistor). Monitor while discharging and/or
     verify that there is no residual charge with a suitable voltmeter.

   o Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered and
     unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped
     locations or difficult to access locations.

   o If you must probe live, put electrical tape over all but the last 1/16"
     of the test probes to avoid the possibility of an accidental short which
     could cause damage to various components. Clip the reference end of the
     meter or scope to the appropriate ground return so that you need to only
     probe with one hand.

   o Perform as many tests as possible with power off and the equipment
     unplugged. For example, the semiconductors in the power supply section
     of a TV or monitor can be tested for short circuits with an ohmmeter.

   o Use an isolation transformer if there is any chance of contacting line
     connected circuits. A Variac(tm) is not an isolation transformer! The
     use of a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet is a
     good idea but will not protect you from shock from many points in a line
     connected TV or monitor, electronic flash or strobe, or the high voltage
     side of a microwave oven, for example. (Note however, that, a GFCI may
     nuisance trip at power-on or at other random times due to leakage paths
     (like your scope probe ground) or the highly capacitive or inductive
     input characteristics of line powered equipment.) A fuse or circuit
     breaker is too slow and insensitive to provide any protection for you or
     in many cases, your equipment. However, these devices may save your
     scope probe ground wire should you accidentally connect it to a live
     chassis.

   o Don't attempt repair work, construction, or testing when you are tired.
     Not only will you be more careless, but your primary diagnostic tool -
     deductive reasoning - will not be operating at full capacity.

   o Finally, never assume anything without checking it out for yourself!
     Don't take shortcuts!

@node 2.4 "Safe discharging of capacitors in electronic flash units"

A working electronic flash or strobe may discharge its capacitors fairly
quickly when it is shut off but most DO NOT do this. Furthermore, do not
assume that triggering the flash fully discharges either the power supply
filter or main energy storage capacitors fully - especially if it is a
sophisticated automatic unit.

The main filter capacitors in the low voltage power supply may have bleeder
resistors to drain their charge relatively quickly - but resistors can fail.
Don't depend on them. For battery powered equipment in particular, efforts
may have been made NOT to bleed the energy storage capacitor to conserve on
battery power should another shot be desired at a future time. Some units
even keep the flash fully charged when supposedly turned off!

The technique I recommend is to use a high wattage resistor of about 5 to 50
ohms/V of the working voltage of the capacitor. This will prevent the
arc-welding associated with screwdriver discharge but will have a short
enough time constant so that the capacitor will drop to a low voltage in at
most a few seconds (dependent of course on the RC time constant and its
original voltage).

Then check with a voltmeter to be double sure. Better yet, monitor while
discharging.

Obviously, make sure that you are well insulated!

For the power supply filter capacitors or main energy storage capacitors,
which might be 400 uF at 350 V, a 2 K ohm 25 W resistor would be suitable.
RC=.8 second. 5RC=4 seconds. A lower wattage resistor (compared to that
calculated from V^^2 / R) can be used since the total energy stored in the
capacitor is not that great (but still potentially lethal).

The discharge tool and circuit described in the next two sections can be used
to provide a visual indication of polarity and charge for TV, monitor, SMPS,
power supply filter capacitors and small electronic flash energy storage
capacitors, and microwave oven high voltage capacitors.

Reasons to use a resistor and not a screwdriver to discharge capacitors:

  1. It will not destroy screwdrivers and capacitor terminals.

  2. It will not damage the capacitor (due to the current pulse).

  3. It will reduce your spouse's stress level in not having to hear those
     scary snaps and crackles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.5 "Capacitor discharge tool"

A suitable discharge tool for each of these applications can be made as quite
easily. The capacitor discharge indicator circuit described below can be
built into this tool to provide a visual display of polarity and charge (not
really needed for CRTs as the discharge time constant is virtually
instantaneous even with a multi-M ohm resistor.

   o Solder one end of the appropriate size resistor (for your application)
     along with the indicator circuit (if desired) to a well insulated clip
     lead about 2-3 feet long. For safety reasons, these connections must be
     properly soldered - not just wrapped.

   o Solder the other end of the resistor (and discharge circuit) to a well
     insulated contact point such as a 2 inch length of bare #14 copper wire
     mounted on the end of a 2 foot piece of PVC or Plexiglas rod which will
     act as an extension handle.

   o Secure everything to the insulating rod with some plastic electrical
     tape.

This discharge tool will keep you safely clear of the danger area.

Again, always double check with a reliable voltmeter or by shorting with an
insulated screwdriver!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.6 "Capacitor discharge indicator circuit"

Here is a suggested circuit which will discharge the high voltage power
supply filter capacitors and main energy storage capacitors of most types of
electronic flash units and strobe lights. This circuit can be built into the
discharge tool described above.

A visual indication of charge and polarity is provided from maximum input
down to a few volts.

The total discharge time is approximately 1 second per 100 uF of capacitance
(5RC with R = 2 K ohms).

Safe capability of this circuit with values shown is about 500 V and 1000 uF
maximum. Adjust the component values for your particular application.

The two sets of 4 diodes will maintain a nearly constant voltage drop of
about 2.8-3 V across the LED+resistor as long as the input is greater than
around 20 V. NOTE: this means that the brightness of the LED is NOT an
indication of the value of the voltage on the capacitor until it drops below
about 20 volts. The brightness will then decrease until it cuts off totally
at around 3 volts.

Safety note: always confirm discharge with a voltmeter before touching any
high voltage capacitors!

@node 3.1 "Electronic flash problems"

A variety of failures are possible with electronic flash units. Much of the
circuitry is similar for battery/AC adapter and line powered units but the
power supplies in particular do differ substantially.

Most common problems are likely to be failures of the power supply, bad
connections, dried up or deformed energy storage or other electrolytic
capacitor(s) and physical damage to the to the flashtube or other components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 3.2 "Problems unique to battery or AC adapter powered electronic flash units"

   o Power source - dead or weak batteries or defective charging circuit,
     incorrect or bad AC adapter, worn power switch, or bad connections.

     Symptoms: unit is totally dead, intermittent, or has excessively long
     cycle time.

     Test and/or replace batteries. Determine if batteries are being charged.
     Check continuity of power switch or interlock and inspect for corroded
     battery contacts and bad connections or cold solder joints on the
     circuit board.

   o Power invertor - blown chopper transistor, bad transformer, other
     defective components.

     Symptoms: unit is totally dead or loads down power source when switched
     on (or at all times with some compact cameras). No high pitched audible
     whine when charging the capacitor. Regulator failure may result in
     excess voltage on the flash tube and spontaneous triggering or failure
     of the energy storage capacitor or other components.

     Test main chopper transistor for shorts and opens. This is the most
     likely failure. There is no easy way to test the transformer and the
     other components rarely fail. Check for bad connections.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 3.3 "Problems unique to AC line powered electronic flash units"

WARNING: Line powered units often do not include a power transformer.
Therefore, none of the circuitry is isolated from the AC line. Read,
understand, and follow the safety guidelines for working on line powered
equipment. Use an isolation transformer while troubleshooting. However,
realize that this will NOT protect you from the charge on the large high
voltage power supply and energy storage capacitors. Take all appropriate
precautions.

   o Power source - dead outlet or incorrect line voltage.

     Symptoms: unit is totally dead, operates poorly, catches fire, or blows
     up. Spontaneous triggering may be the result of a regulator failure or
     running on a too high line voltage (if the unit survives).

     Test outlet with a lamp or circuit tester. Check line voltage setting on
     flash unit (if it is not too late!).

   o Power supply - bad line cord or power switch, blown fuse, defective
     rectifiers or capacitors in voltage doubler, defective components, or
     bad connections.

     Symptoms: unit is totally dead or fuse blows. Excessive cycle time.

     Test fuse. If blown check for shorted components like rectifiers and
     capacitors in the power supply. If fuse is ok, test continuity of line
     cord, power switch, and other input components and wiring. Check
     rectifiers for opens and the capacitors for opens or reduced value.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 3.4 "Problems common to all electronic flash units"

WARNING: the amount of charge contained in the energy storage capacitor may
be enough to kill - especially with larger AC line powered flash units and
high power studio equipment. Read and follow all safety guidelines with
respect to high voltage high power equipment. Discharge the energy storage
capacitors fully (see the section:
@{"Safe discharging of capacitors in electronic flash units" link "2.4"}) and then measure to
double check that they are totally flat before touching anything. Don't assume
that triggering a flash does this for you (especially for automatic units).
For added insurance, clip a wire across the capacitor terminals while doing
any work inside the unit. Better to blow a fuse than you if you should forget
to remove it.

   o Energy storage capacitor - dried up or shorted, leaky or needs to be
     'reformed'.

     Symptoms: reduced light output and unusually short cycle time may
     indicate a dried up capacitor. Heavy loading of power source with low
     frequency or weak audible whine may indicate a shorted capacitor.
     Excessively long cycle time may mean that the capacitor has too much
     leakage or needs to be reformed.

     Test for shorts and value. Substitute another capacitor of similar or
     smaller uF rating and at least equal voltage rating if available.

     Cycling the unit at full power several times should reform a capacitor
     that has deteriorated due to lack of use. If the flash intensity and
     cycle time do not return to normal after a dozen or so full intensity
     flashes, the capacitor may need to be replaced or there may be some
     other problem with the power supply.

   o Trigger circuit - bad trigger capacitor, trigger transformer, SCR (if
     used), or other components.

     Symptoms: energy storage capacitor charges as indicated by the audible
     invertor whine changing frequency increasing in pitch until ready light
     comes on (if it does) but pressing shutter release or manual test button
     has no effect. Spontaneous triggering may be a result of a component
     breaking down or an intermittent short circuit.

     Test for voltage on the trigger capacitor and continuity of the trigger
     transformer windings. Confirm that the energy storage capacitor is
     indeed fully charged with a voltmeter.

   o Ready light - bad LED or neon bulb, resistor, zener, or bad connections.

     Symptoms: flash works normally but no indication from ready light. Or,
     ready light on all the time or prematurely.

     Test for voltage on the LED or neon bulb and work backwards to its
     voltage supply - either the trigger or energy storage capacitor or
     invertor trans- former. In the latter case (where load detection is used
     instead of simple voltage monitoring) there may be AC across the lamp so
     a DC measurement may be deceptive.)

   o Trigger initiator - shutter contacts or cable.

     Symptoms: manual test button will fire flash but shutter release has no
     effect.

     Test for shutter contact closure, clean hot shoe contacts (if relevant),
     inspect and test for bad connections, test or swap cable, clean shutter
     contacts (right, good luck). Try an alternate way of triggering the
     flash like a cable instead of a the hot shoe.

   o Xenon tube - broken or leaky.

     Symptoms: energy storage and trigger capacitors charges to proper
     voltage but the manual test button does not fire the flash even though
     you can hear the tick that indicates that the trigger circuit is
     discharging.

     Inspect the flash tube for physical damage. Substitute another similar
     or somewhat larger (but not smaller) flash tube. A neon bulb can be put
     across the trigger transformer output and ground to see if it flashes
     when you press the manual test button shutter release. This won't
     determine if the trigger voltage high enough but will provide an
     indication that most of the trigger circuitry is operating.

@node 3.5 "Electronic flash dead after long time in storage"

The unit may be totally dead or take so long to charge that you give up.

For rechargeable units, try charging for the recommended time (24 hours if
you don't know what it is). Then, check the battery voltage. If it does not
indicate full charge (roughly 1.2 x n for NiCds, 2 x n for lead-acid where n
is the number of cells), then the battery is likely expired and will need to
be replaced.

Even for testing, don't just remove the bad rechargeable batteries - replace
them. They may be required to provide filtering for the power supply even
when running off the AC line or adapter.

For units with disposable batteries, of course try a fresh set but first
thoroughly clean the battery contacts.

See the sections on @{"batteries" link "3.2"}

The energy storage capacitor will tend to 'deform' resulting in high leakage
and reduced capacity after long non-use. However, you should still be able to
hear the high pitched whine of the invertor.

Where the unit shows no sign of life on batteries or AC, check for dirty
switch contacts and bad internal connections. Electrolytic capacitors in the
power supply and invertor may have deteriorated as well.

If the unit simply takes a long time to charge, cycling it a dozen times
should restore an energy storage capacitor that is has deformed but is
salvageable. This is probably safe for the energy storage capacitor as the
power source is current limited. However, there is no way of telling if
continuous operation with the excessive load of the leaky energy storage
capacitor will overheat power supply or invertor components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.1 "General strobe circuit design"

Here are some general guidelines for the design of a small (5-20 W-s) battery
or line operated strobe.

Most small flashlamps will operate on about 300 V (some as low as 250 - or
less). If the flashlamp voltage is too low, the tube may not fire reliably or
at all. If the flashlamp voltage is too high, spontaneous firing or damage
and/or shortened flashlamp life due to excessive current may be the result.
For power, you will need one of the following:

  1. An inverter putting out about 300 VDC from your battery. Some of the
     cheap disposable cameras use as little as 1.5 V but don't expect too
     much battery life. There are zillions of simple inverter designs that
     will work using either discrete transistors or ICs with some minimal
     external components. The easiest way to obtain the inverter is to rip
     one out of a dead camera. Try garage sales, flea markets, thrift stores,
     or your Aunt Patty's attic. Typical cost for a cheap pocket camera from
     these sources is $.50 to $2. I don't know what your Aunt charges.
     Otherwise, you can build one easily. The only difficult part is finding
     a suitable transformer. They are easy to wind but don't expect great
     efficiency unless extreme care is taken in the design. For designing IC
     based DC-DC convertors, check out companies like Maxim and Linear
     Technology. These generally only require minimal external components
     like capacitors, diodes, and an inductor or two - but often no
     transformers.

  2. A line operated voltage doubler for 110 VAC (just a rectifier for 220
     VAC). When the peak voltage of the AC line is considered, these supplies
     will provide about 300-320 VDC. Common 1N4005/6/7 silicon rectifiers and
     small (e.g., 16 uF) 250 V electrolytics can be used for the doubler.
     Include a surge limiting resistor of about 22 ohms in the common as well
     as a current limiting resistor in the output (before the energy storage
     capacitor) to allow the flashlamp arc to quench (e.g., 100-1000 ohms). A
     line fuse, power switch, and power indicator are also essential.
     WARNING: the is a non-isolated line operated power supply - see safety
     guidelines. Do not connect triggering circuit directly - use capacitive
     or transformer coupling for safety.

  3. An energy storage capacitor. A 200 uF capacitor charged to 320 V will
     give you 1/2*C*V*V = 10 W-s. Xenon flashlamps are rated in terms of both
     maximum flash energy and maximum average power (as well as others but
     for small strobe units - under 25 W-s or so - these are the most
     critical). These ratings should not be exceeded. For example, a tube
     rated at 20 W-s flash energy and 5 W average power could be flashed at
     most once every 4 seconds at a 20 W-s level or at most once every second
     at a 5 W-s level. Use a smaller capacitor for more frequent flashing.
     While photoflash rated capacitors are desirable, you should be able to
     get away with any good quality electrolytic for this type of modest
     power application. Note that the typical pocket camera flash uses a
     100-400 uF capacitor and puts out quite a lot of light.

  4. A trigger circuit. This is usually a HV pulse transformer into whose
     primary you discharge a small capacitor - .1 uF at 100-300 V is typical.
     The high voltage secondary is designed to put out 4-10 KV depending on
     flashlamp size and type. If the voltage of the trigger pulse is too low,
     the flashlamp may not fire or may fire erratically. If the trigger
     voltage is too high, there may be arcing to the flashlamp electrodes or
     other components resulting in possible damage. The trigger output is
     connected with a short wire to an electrode (wire, foil, or metal
     reflector) that is in close proximity to the xenon tube. The high
     voltage pulse ionizes the xenon gas mixture allowing the storage
     capacitor to discharge through it. Trigger transformers are available
     from places like Digikey and Mouser Electronics. These can also be
     constructed relatively easily. Though not very compact, a TV or monitor
     flyback or automotive ignition coil will also work as a trigger
     transformer.

     An SCR can be substituted for physical switch contacts where electronic
     control of the trigger is desired. For the battery powered unit, there
     is no issue of line isolation and the cathode of the SCR can be tied
     directly to the ground of your logic circuits. However, with the line
     operated strobe, isolation is essential for safety - use capacitor or
     transformer coupling, or an optoisolator.

@node 4.2 "Strobe design parameters"

The common photographic strobe is not really designed for very short flash
duration. While a typical electronic flash is much much shorter than one of
those antique flash bulbs, it is still long compared to what is possible.
Typical flash duration for a full power flash is under a millisecond with the
range of automatic units going down to 20 microseconds or less for a minimum
energy flash. One of those antique flash bulbs, on the other hand, had a
flash duration of between 5 and 20 milliseconds. For most common photography,
1 millisecond or less is for all intents and purposes, instantaneous.
However, if you want to freeze the blades of a rotating turbine or stop
bullet in flight, even 20 microseconds is way too long. Some of the highest
speed photographs using the light source to control exposure have been taken
with spark gaps operating at many KV resulting in flash durations as low as
fractions of microseconds. Even higher speed photography is possible using
electronic image tubes. The first instants of conventional or nuclear
detonations have been captured using this type of technology.

For more information on high speed photography, see the classic works by
Harold E. ("Doc") Edgerton. The following are just some general comments:

Several design parameters influence flash intensity, duration, and maximum
repeat rate. However, the relationships are not linear as a flashlamp is a
gas discharge device with complex negative resistance characteristics. It is
necessary to consult the flashlamp manufacturer's data sheets to do any
detailed design.

  1. Voltage. For a given energy, flash duration is inversely proportional to
     flash lamp voltage. The higher the voltage, the shorter the flash.

  2. Capacitor size in uF. Total flash light output is proportional to the
     energy storage capacitor uF rating. However, both the peak intensity and
     the flash duration will increase with a larger capacitor.

  3. Impedance of discharge path. Since the circuit when triggered is
     basically a capacitor discharging into a low impedance load, both the
     duration and peak intensity are affected. In addition, for higher
     capacity strobes especially, controlling this impedance is critical to
     achieving optimal light output as well as maximizing the life of the
     flash lamp. Excessive peak discharge current as well as reverse current
     due to overshoot and ringing reduces flash lamp life through damage to
     the electrodes. Too much instantaneous current and the flashlamp may
     explode.

  4. Flashlamp design. The diameter, length, material, gas pressure, and
     electrode construction, etc. all affect the performance and power
     handling capabilities.

  5. Cooling. Convection, forced air, and liquid (water or oil) cooling may
     be used. Dramatically higher average power is possible using liquid flow
     cooling if the flash lamp design will permit this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.3 "Some guidelines for designing small xenon strobes"

Flashlamp manufacturers publish very detailed data sheets for their products.
For high power strobe design, all this information is essential. However,
when building small strobe units (under 20 W-s), my general rules-of-thumb
are:

  1. Use a 250 - 350 V power supply for the energy storage capacitor.
     Depending on your application, this can be a battery or AC adapter
     powered invertor, transformer/rectifier power supply, a line operated
     voltage doubler for 110 VAC or a simple line rectifier and filter
     capacitor for 220 VAC.

  2. Use a trigger transformer capable of 4-5 KV or more pulse output. The
     actual output trigger pulse voltage can be controlled by the voltage on
     the trigger capacitor. This is usually obtained from a voltage divider
     off of the energy storage capacitor. Too low and it won't flash
     reliably. Too high and arcing to nearby components may occur.

  3. Follow the flashlamp manufacturer's ratings for maximum flash energy and
     average power. If you ripped the flashlamp out of something like a
     pocket camera, limit your flash energy to that provided by the capacitor
     contained in the unit or 10 W-s per inch of flashlamp length if the
     capacitor value is unknown. Limit the average power to this maximum
     energy every five seconds or the actual minimum full power cycle time if
     this known.

  4. Use a photoflash rated capacitor if available but any good quality
     capacitor will probably work fine. No inductor is needed for these low
     power applications. For a 320 V power supply, flash energy is just about
     5 W-s per 100 uF of energy storage capacitor rating.

  5. Keep lead lengths between the energy storage capacitor and the flashlamp
     reasonably short (a few inches is fine). Minimize the length of the wire
     from the trigger transformer and make sure that it is well insulated and
     not in proximity to any other components.

  6. Make sure human contact with all line connected and high voltage
     components is impossible during operation or at any time when a charge
     is present on the power supply or energy storage capacitors - by
     packaging everything in a plastic or grounded metal box, for example.

  7. Always use capacitor, transformer, or optical isolation when triggering
     line powered strobe units from low voltage logic circuits or anything
     that a human may contact. This is recommended in general as it will
     assure that no high power transients find their way back into sensitive
     electronic circuits.

  8. Don't neglect the essential power switch, fuse(s), and indicator lights.
     For logic controlled or computerized strobes, a mechanical test button
     using a hard set of contacts (i.e., across the SCR) is highly desirable.

@node 4.4 "Transformers for low voltage powered strobe invertors"

It is usually not possible to determine all parameters of the invertor
transformer when reverse engineering pocket camera strobes.

(The following is from: Kevin Horton (khorton@tech.iupui.edu))

This is always the kicker. I have devoting heavy amounts of time into
figuring out how these transformers work. They are very, very special.
nothing else will work in their place, or if it does, it'll be woefully
inefficient. They are usually .4" or so cubed, but may be larger. The gap on
the core seems to be pretty critical- it limits the overall current that the
circuit will draw. In one particular strobe I disassembled, they had a 100 pf
cap coming from the output of the HV winding directly tied to the base of the
drive transistor! I finally figured out why: it controlled the frequency vs
voltage of the oscillator, hence giving it more current as it was completing
a charging cycle!

I've disassembled many of these small transformers. Unlike most ferrite
transformers, these are usually held together by dipping them in wax, rather
than varnish. Some transformers have the primaries wound on the core, while
others have it on the outside. I haven't figured out exactly why this is.
However, one one transformer I took apart, the feedback and drive windings
were wound on the core; bifilar. The feedback was 11 turns, while the primary
was 10. Both were #24. On top of that was thousands of turns of #40 or so
wire.

It seems that the small sizes play a part in the efficiency of these
transformers; since the magnetic field is contained in such a small core
area, the losses are small.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.1 "Converting a pocket camera strobe into a repeating strobe"

The little inverter in those units cannot put out enough power to charge the
normal energy storage capacitor any faster. It is quite easy to replace the
inverter with a voltage doubler off the AC line (with a current limiting
resistor! WARNING: non-isolated power supply). Using a smaller energy storage
capacitor would also permit a much higher flash rate at reduced brightness
and this would prolong the life of the flashtube as well.

With too high a repetition rate at high power, the problem is heat
dissipation in the tube. Above a flash rate of once every couple of seconds,
your poor little tube will degrade fairly quickly and it may not turn off
properly as well due to overheating of the electrodes.

It will probably be necessary to use an SCR instead of a set of switch
contacts to allow triggering from a 555 timer or other logic level input. For
a basic constant frequency strobe, a relaxation oscillator using a
unijunction transistor or neon lamp, an astable multivibrator built from a
couple of general purpose transistors, or a counter operated from the AC line
zero crossings or a crystal oscillator would be perfectly adequate.

However, a very simple repeating trigger can be made from a motor driven cam
operated microswitch. Using a variable speed motor would implement a basic
adjustable frequency stroboscope with no additional electronic components.

In any case, if you retain the invertor, use an AC adapter or other power
supply instead of batteries for testing at least. Otherwise, let me know
which battery company's stock I should buy!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.2 "Strobe design for multiple flashing"

These are often seen in safety related applications - warning lights, for
example, where a typical cycle might be two flashes .2 seconds apart with a
.8 second dead time.

Here is one approach to designing a strobe that will double (or multiple)
flash from a battery powered invertor of limited capacity.

Charge a large buffer storage capacitor from the DC-DC converter, then have
its output feed a smaller flash energy storage capacitor through a resistor
small enough to give you a fast recharge but large enough to allow the
flashlamp arc to quench.

Building the DC-DC converter is pretty easy and you should be able to make it
run off of a battery without any problem. You can use a simple power
oscillator feeding a home-wound step-up transformer. With the energy buffer,
the invertor only needs to satisfy the average power requirements of the
multi-flash cycle. See the section: @{"General strobe circuit design" link "4.1"}

For example, a small unit using a 100 uF 330 V capacitor for the flash could
use a 1000 uF cap. for buffer storage separated by a 250 ohm power resistor.
That would provide a 100 ms or so cycle time. The 1000 uF cap provides a
reservoir between the relatively low power DC-DC converter and the tube as
long as you do not flash too quickly - faster than your DC-DC converter can
keep up.

This should be much easier than trying to interrupt the 10s-100s of amperes
of current flowing in the tube during the flash.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.3 "Repeating strobe trigger generators"

Here are two simple circuits for generating a continuously repeating strobe
trigger.

It is assumed that the power supply and xenon tube can handle the average
power requirements for the minimum desired cycle time.

Inadequate energy storage capacitor charging power will result in erratic or
reduced intensity flashing. Excessive heating caused by too high a repeat
rate may lead to damage to circuit components and/or the flashlamp or may
result in the arc not quenching properly between flashes.

Inadequate trigger charging power (RC time constant too long) will result in
missed or erratic triggering.

@node 5.6 "Relaxation oscillator operation"

The neon indicator, NT1, is a negative resistance device. It becomes
conductive when the voltage across it exceeds about 90 V but then only
requires about 60 V to maintain conduction. This circuit has an RC network
formed by R1, R2, and C1. C1 charges through R1 and the repeat rate
adjustment potentiometer, R2. When its voltage exceeds the NE2 breakdown
voltage, C1 discharges through NT1 resulting on a pulse on R3 coupled by C2
to the gate of SCR1. The SCR fires and discharges the trigger capacitor (not
shown) into the trigger transformer of the strobe firing circuit.

Once the voltage across NT1 has decreased below about 60 V, it turns off and
the cycle repeats. Since the voltage across NT1 is swinging between about 60
and 90 V (out of 150 VDC total), the repeat frequency should be between 4 and
5 times 1/(RC). It is assumed that SCR1 (Out+/-) takes the place of the
shutter contacts, is the SCR, or in parallel with the SCR shown in the strobe
circuits shown elsewhere in this document.

For other values of VPP between about 100 and 300 V, adjust resistance values
appropriately.

powered strobes.

several KV (7.5 KV for the specific part shown).

This basic design would be suitable for a wide variety of applications

@node 5.8 "Optoisolated remote trigger operation"

The input signal may be DC coupled resulting is a high level triggering the
strobe or AC coupled resulting in a positive edge trigger. R1 provides
current limiting to the optoisolator's LED and R2 minimizes any possibility
of electrical noise turning on the optoisolator. Change the values of R1 and
R2 for a different input voltage range. D2 provides reverse voltage
protection for the LED.

For VPP greater than 10 V, the voltage divider formed by R3 and R4 charges C2
to about 5 V. This is the most common case where VPP is derived from the
strobe power supply and is typically 300 V. The time constant for this RC
network is under 5 ms so it will not affect high speed repeat operation. C2
assures that there will be enough current from the optoisolator to trigger
SCR1 even with the high value resistor which may be used for R3 to minimize
power dissipation with a large VPP. For a VPP of less than 10 V, the circuit
can be simplified to just a current limiting resistor (leave out R4).

When current flows through OPTO1's LED, it turns on the phototransistor which
allows C2 to discharge into the gate of SCR1 which is connected to the
trigger capacitor and transformer of the flashlamp firing circuit (not
shown).

To minimize the possibility of false triggering, locate the optoisolator
circuit in close proximity to the SCR. R5 and C3 are included to reduce the
SCR's sensitivity to any electrical noise pickup as well.

VPP must be a positive DC voltage referenced to the terminal Out-. In most
cases, this will be the energy storage capacitor's positive terminal.

@node 5.9 "Strobe systems with multiple flashheads"

Have you seen the 'new' ball used for the New Year's celebration on top of
the tower in Times Square? Is uses something like 144 computer controlled
xenon lamps. Sort of gives you something to strive for!

Two approaches can be taken in designing such systems depending on the needs.
If only one flashlamp is to fire at any given time, a single energy storage
capacitor can be shared by multiple flashlamps assuming the distance between
it and any flashlamp is not excessive (probably less than a couple of feet).
Alternatively, each flashlamp can be connected to its own energy storage
capacitor fed through a current limiting resistor from one high capacity
power supply. Hybrid systems using a combination of these techniques are also
possible.

In all cases, each flashlamp must have its own trigger transformer. An
optoisolated SCR can then be controlled from a logic level signal - the
output of a PC's parallel port or a dedicated bus. For long runs, use Schmitt
Trigger gates or differential line drivers/receivers to prevent false
triggering due to interference from the high voltage and high current pulses
associated with each flashlamp's firing.

@node 5.10 "Kevin's Super Strobomatic"

(The following is from: Kevin Horton (khorton@tech.iupui.edu))

I'm building a super strobe bar! It has 8 strobe tubes under computer
control.  (Actually a PIC processor, but hey, computer is a computer. I have
all the stuff done except the control section, and I only have 2 of the 8
strobe units done due to the fact that I haven't found any more cheap cameras
at the thrift store! (One Saturday morning's worth of garage sales and flea
markets would remedy that! --- sam).

It runs on 12 V, at up to 6 A, and can fire the tubes at a rate of about 8-10
times per second. The storage cap is a 210 uf, 330 V model; it gets to about
250 V to 300 V before firing; depending on how long it has had to charge.
Because of this high speed, the tubes get shall we say, a little warm. (Well,
maybe a lot warm --- sam). I have it set up at the moment driving two
alternating 5 W-s tubes. I'm pumping them quite a bit too hard, as the
electrodes start to glow after oh, about 5 seconds or so of continuous use. I
know, a high class problem, indeed! My final assembly will have 8 tubes
spaced about 8 inches apart on a 2x4, with a Plexiglass U-shaped enclosure
with a nice 12 V fan blowing air through one end of the channel to cool the
inverter and the tubes. Stay tuned.

details of this design:

@node 5.11 "Tiny tiny invertor design"

(The following is from: Kevin Horton (khorton@tech.iupui.edu))

I have developed a cool little transformer circuit that seems to be very
efficient. I built this inverter as tiny as I could make it. It runs off of
3V, and charges up a little 1 uf 250V cap all the way up in about 30 seconds;
drawing about 5 to 8 mA in the process. The numbers by the windings tell the
number of turns. The primary and feedback windings are #28, while the
secondary is #46. Yes, #46! I could hardly tell what gauge it was, as it was
almost too small to measure with my micrometer! It may be #44 or #45, but at
these sizes, who knows? I used a trigger transformer for the wire. I used all
the wire on it, to be exact; it all JUST fit on the little bobbin. The
primary went on the core first, then the secondary, and finally the feedback
winding. This order is very important. I used a ferrite bobbin and
corresponding ferrite 'ring' that fit on it. The whole shebang was less than
1 cm in diameter, and about 3-5 mm high! I gave it a coat of wax to seal
things up, and made the inverter circuit with surface-mount parts, which I
then waxed onto the top. There are two wires in, and two wires out. It's
enough to run a neon fairly brightly at 1.2 V, with a 3 ma current draw.

@node 5.12 "Light beam triggered strobe circuit"

Here, the intention is to trigger a strobe should a light beam be interrupted
or completed. Any of the electronic flash schematics can be modified for this
purpose.

The circuit below should work for the detector. Its output may need to be put
through one (light beam completed) or two (light beam interrupted) inverting
Schmitt Trigger gates (e.g., 74LS14) to clean up its output and provide the
proper polarity. It should be AC coupled to the gate of an SCR. The SCR will
substitute for the camera's X-sync contacts and fire the strobe. Note that if
this is a line operated unit, capacitor (or transformer) coupling is
essential for providing the very important line isolation barrier absolutely
required for safety.

For the case where the strobe is supposed to fire when the light beam is
interrupted, when the light beam is unbroken, the photodiode is illuminated
providing current to keep the transistor on and its output is low. When the
beam is broken, the output goes high, is cleaned up by the Schmitt Trigger
gates creating a rising edge to provide a pulse to trigger the SCR.

Any common IR or visible photodiode can be used for PD1. Sources include
optoisolators, photosensors from dead VCRs, and optomechanical computer mice.

Notes:

  1. CAUTION: Capacitors provide needed isolation barrier for line connection
     electronic flash units.

  2. For detecting a light beam being completed, an inversion is needed.
     Therefore, use an inverting Schmitt Trigger or a single 74LS14s invertor
     gate.

  3. For detecting a light beam being interrupted, no inversion is needed.
     Therefore, use a non-inverting Schmitt Trigger or 2 74LS14s invertor
     gates.

@node 6.1 "Photoflash circuit from Keystone pocket camera"

This schematic was traced from an electronic flash unit removed from an
inexpensive pocket camera, a Keystone model XR308.

Note that the ready light is not in the usual place monitoring the energy
storage capacitor voltage. It operates on the principle that once nearly full
charge is reached and the invertor is not being heavily loaded, enough drive
voltage is available from an auxiliary winding on the invertor transformer to
light the LED. It is also interesting that the trigger circuit dumps charge
into the trigger capacitor instead of the other way around but the effect is
the same.

@node 6.5 "Vivitar Auto 253 electronic flash circuit"

The Vivitar Auto 253 is a typical small inexpensive automatic electronic
flash. As is typical of these designs, the flashlamp is paralleled with a
quenchtube. This is a small discharge tube that looks something like an
oversized neon indicator light (but probably xenon filled). The quenchtube is
triggered at a time after the main flashlamp fires which is determined by the
light reflected from the subject and terminates the flash when adequate
exposure has been achieved. The actual trigger circuit using an SCR to pulse
a trigger transformer applying a 4-5 KV pulse to a foil wrapping on the
quenchtube. Typical flash duration for small automatic electronic flash units
vary from about 1/50,000 second for a minimum energy (closeup) flash to
1/1000 second for a maximum energy (distant subject or manual) flash.

The power supply portion of this unit is interesting as well. It can operate
on either AC (220 V, it would seem from the circuit) or a 9 V battery. For
AC, a simple half wave rectifier produces about 320 VDC needed by the
flashlamp. On DC, it uses an invertor that operates on a 9 V battery rather
than the 3 V which is typical of many cheap pocket cameras. This results in a
fairly rapid cycle time of about 2 seconds.

The ready light looks like an ordinary NE2 neon bulb but must have a
different gas mixture as it does not turn on until nearly full charge is
reached on the energy storage capacitor. There appears to be no voltage
divider. In addition, there is another lamp that provides a nice green
illumination for the flash 'computer' dial. This looks like a neon indicator
lamp but with an internal phosphor coating.

I have observed the spectrum of these things. I have seen two different gas
fills in these that emit UV that makes the green-glowing phosphor do its
stuff. One bulb type about the size of an NE-2H uses a mixture of neon and
xenon. GE made those things (I don't know if anyone else ever did), which are
called NE-2G lamps. The other type, a much smaller one that I found in Radio
Shack's 272-708 green neon "cartridge", uses a mixture of neon and krypton.

The Vivitar schematic is split into two parts with FL1, C1, and L1 duplicated
to improve readability.

@node 6.5.4 "Vivitar Auto 253 exposure control operation"

The power inputs, X and Y, may come from the Vivitar Auto 253 power supply
circuit (above), other battery/AC adapter powered invertor, or other AC line
operated power supply.

  1. Quench trigger capacitor, C7, charges from energy storage capacitor, C1,
     through voltage divider formed by R7 and R8.

  2. Flashlamp is triggered by 4-5 KV pulse from main trigger transformer, T2
     (not shown) when shutter contacts close.

  3. Because of series inductor, L1, voltage across flashlamp drops abruptly
     when current starts flowing. (NOTE: I am calling this an inductor - from
     appearance only - as it is unmarked. It may just be a small high current
     resistor).

  4. This negative step is coupled by C6 to cathode of the quench trigger
     thyristor, SCR1. The anode-to-cathode voltage does not change but the
     cathode becomes negative with respect to the energy storage capacitor
     negative (common) terminal which feeds the gate circuit.

  5. CDS light sensor, LS1, R8, and C9 form an RC network with a time
     constant inversely proportional to the light reflected off of the
     subject. Voltage on SCR1's gate increases as C9 charges.

  6. When enough light has been detected indicating proper exposure, SCR1 is
     triggered dumping C7 through quench trigger transformer. Resulting 4-5
     KV pulse ionizes (xenon) gas in quenchtube.

  7. The quenchtube has a lower voltage drop than the flashlamp and thus
     bypasses any charge remaining on C1 around FL1 terminating the light
     output.

  1. Power transformer, T1, in conjunction with D1, D2, and C1-C4, provides
     1.7 KV DC. The power supply doubler capacitors are also used as the
     energy storage capacitors. Resistors, R1-R4, equalize the voltage drops
     across the series capacitors to compensate for slight differences in
     leakage resistance. R5 and R6 limit inrush current and charge rate.

  2. The trigger capacitor, C5, charges through T2 from the voltage divider
     formed by R7 and R8.

  3. Ready light and capacitor bank voltage monitoring circuits are not
     shown.

  4. Applying a 5 V signal to the Fire input turns on SCR1 dumping C5 into
     the primary of the trigger transformer, T2. This generates a 30 KV pulse
     which ionizes the xenon gas in the flashlamp, FL1.

  5. The energy storage capacitor bank discharges through L1 and FL1.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.6.2 "High power (laser pump) strobe notes"

  1. WARNING: If you thought line operated equipment was dangerous, this is
     much much worse. The power transformer output is enough to kill. Once
     doubled and stored in the capacitor bank, it is LETHAL. The total energy
     storage is about 1300 W-s (this is not a typo!). Based on one estimate,
     this is enough energy to KILL 20 adult humans simultaneously with the
     power supply unplugged from the AC line - and still have some juice left
     over. TAKE EXTREME CARE!

  2. Fuse, power switch, power-on light, and all other absolutely essential
     safety interlocks and indicators are not shown. R1-R4 do act as bleeder
     resistors and will discharge the capacitor bank to safe levels in about
     10 MINUTES. However, don't depend on these. Resistors can fail. Use the
     capacitor discharge tool and indicator.

  3. The power transformer from a tube type (old) TV set would probably be
     suitable for T1. Microwave oven high voltage rectifiers may be used for
     D1 and D2. A high power xenon tube like this requires a 30+ KV trigger
     pulse. Those little tiny trigger transformers will NOT work. Capacitors,
     C1-C4, must be rated for photoflash rapid discharge.

  4. High power strobes require special flashlamps - anything from a pocket
     camera or electronic flash will explode into a mass of molten bits of
     glass and metal. This design is derived from one using a tube from EG&G
     Electro-Optics. I do not know if they still exist. Even a properly
     specified flashlamp may explode - operate only behind protective
     shielding. Flashlamp cooling must be adequate for desired cycle time.

  5. L1 helps to shape the discharge current pulse. For high power strobe
     designs, a series inductor is essential to optimize power output and
     prevent damage to the flashlamp due to excessively high current and
     negative voltage (undershoot resulting in reverse current). A damping
     factor of .8 is generally recommended. The 25 uH value is just an
     estimate - L1 must be calculated for each combination of energy storage
     capacitor value, voltage, and the impedance characteristics of the
     specific flashlamp to be used.

  6. Flash energy is about 1300 W-s. For a typical flash duration of 250 uS,
     this is an equivalent power input to the flashlamp of 5.2 MW! Adjust
     component values for the desired application.

  7. DO NOT even think about staring at the flashlamp when fired. The peak
     light output is equivalent to at least 500,000 - 100 W light bulbs! Even
     when averaged over the 1/40th of a second typical response of the human
     eye, this is still more than 5,000 - 100 W light bulbs. (NOTE: this
     estimate takes into account the increased luminous efficiency of xenon
     flashlamps compared to incandescent light bulbs.)

  8. Make sure all optical components - especially the flashlamp - are
     cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and a lint free cloth to remove all
     traces of contaminants.

  9.

  1. D1 and C1 form a half wave doubler which produces a waveform across D1
     which is approximately a sinusoid with a p-p voltage of 2*1.414*VRMS of
     the line or about 320 V. (The peaks will get squashed with a significant
     load).

  2. C2 charges from this through D2 to about 300 V. The flashlamp fires when
     triggered by the HV pulse from the #1 sparkplug connection. NOTE: this
     requires a direct connection, not an inductive pickup.

  3. I would think that there will be some beating of the charging and flash
     for high rpms but the timing will be accurate. In other words, it will
     not fire for every rotation of the crankshaft since C2 cannot recover
     quickly enough but will flash at the proper instant when C2 has charged
     to a sufficient voltage. (This is probably by design - otherwise, the
     flashlamp would overheat very quickly at high rpms.)

@node 6.8 "Variable intensity variable frequency stroboscope"

The circuit in the companion document of this name is designed to provide a
variety of options in terms of repetition rate, flash intensity, and various
repeat and triggering modes. Due to its complexity, it was drafted using
OrCad SDT (Schematic Capture) and output in postscript format.

The PostScript file is available compressed with PKZIP (for DOS/WIN/MAC
users):

   o strobex.zip (9KB)

and GZIP (for UNIX users):

   o strobex.ps.gz (9KB)

The design includes:

  1. Line operated voltage doubler power supply.

  2. Power transformer operated low voltage logic supply.

  3. Variable frequency repeat mode controlled by 555 timer.

  4. Optoisolated external trigger input.

  5. Selectable flash intensities of .2, 2, and 20 W-s.

  6. Autorepeat speeds from .05 to 100 Hz (though obviously, the flashlamp
     will not operate at all intensities for these entire ranges.)

Parts of this circuit have been built and tested but the entire unit is not
complete. Maybe someday.

@node 7.1 "Why do roulette wheels sometimes appear to spin backward?"

Roulette wheels and wagon wheels spinning backwards represents a form of
aliasing due to sampling. OK, the technical jargon aside this effect will
only take place in a situation where images are captured at discrete
intervals as they are in a motion picture or video - or when illuminated with
a repeating strobe. For motion pictures, something like 24 images per second
are recorded; for video there are 30 images per second (in the US, 25 in many
other countries. However, the use of interlacing where a complete frame is
scanned in two parts - the even and the odd lines - complicates the
explanation so I will restrict the remainder of this discussion to motion
picture film).

If the rotation rate of the wheel is such that one spoke or slot goes by a
given position in exactly 1/24th of a second, the wheel will appear
stationary since successive images will be identical. If it is moving a bit
faster than this it will appear to be moving forward slowly. However, if it
is going a bit slower, then it will be appear to be turning backwards slowly.
The shorter the exposure with respect to the total frame time, the sharper
will be the apparent effect. The number of slots per second of perceived
motion will be equal to the difference in frame rate and number of slots per
second passing a given point. So, a roulette wheel rotating such that 23
slots are passing by per second captured on a 24 frame per second camera will
appear to be moving backwards at 1 slot per second.

The same applies to the use of a strobe light to freeze repetitive motion
like the rotation of a shaft. It is all a matter of the relative speed of the
sampling (the movie, video or strobe) with respect to an object which is
periodic like a roulette or wagon wheel.

You can perform a simple experiment: run an electric fan under a fluorescent
lamp (one with an ordinary magnetic ballest). The light from such a lamp is
not continuous but pulses 120 times per second. Watch for stationary or
slowly rotating blade patterns as the fan speeds up and slows down. See if
you can compute the speed of the fan from this behavior.

@node 7.2 "Kevin attempts to abuse a strobe"

(This from: Kevin 'Destroyer of Worlds' Horton (khorton@tech.iupui.edu))

Just for funsies, I decided to see how much torture I could inflict on the
flashlamp and energy storage capacitor from one of those little Kodak
cameras.  The tube was 1.2" long, in a metalized plastic reflector, with a
thin metal backing to hold it in. The capacitor was 120 uf, 330 V. I hooked
it up to my inverter (12 V->300 V at high current) and fired 'er up! Pop,
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, (turn up trigger oscillator frequency)
popopopopopopopopopopopop! It was firing about 30 or 40 times a second; it
appeared as it was constantly on! I turned it down to about 15 flashes a
second, and let it run. First thing I noticed was that wonderful scent of
melting acrylic. Then, I noticed that the tube was kind of skewed in the
reflector. The plastic was in full smoke-mode by this point. Still, the tube
kept firing! (Let's see: 5 W-s times 15 flashes per second is 75 W average
power, not bad for an itty bitty tube --- sam).

I left it on a bit more, and the plastic really started the smoke-signals! I
noticed that one electrode was glowing cherry red. Even after all this
torture, it kept going! The smoke was getting too much, so I hit the 'off' on
my inverter. A few more gouts of smoke, and the little fire I created was
extinguished. I let it cool down and then I examined the damage. The
reflector was totaled; the tube had all but melted clean through. When I
touched it, the little metal plate popped off.

On closer examination, the tube appeared to be in good shape. I couldn't see
any visible damage to either the electrodes, or the glass seals. A quick test
reveals that the tube still functions. As a side note, the storage capacitor
got quite hot; probably around 35 degrees C. All in all, an interesting test,
I must say. The next will involve connecting up a normal NE2 neon bulb and
observing the results of high voltage and high current on it. I suspect it
will be quite spectacular, so I'm taking precautions - It will be performed
in a proper enclosure, so if the neon decides to really go 'pop', it won't do
any damage.
