@{fg shine}The X-Files [#P]@{fg text}

Special Agent Dana Scully, a medical doctor and instructor at the FBI Academy in Virginia, receives instructions to report to Chief Scott Blevins in Washington. Blevins assigns Scully to investigate - and debunk - an unassigned project dubbed "The X-Files," a burial ground for mysterious, unsolved FBI cases linked to the paranormal.

Scully is instructed to contact Fox Mulder, an agent who has become obsessed with investigating the otherwise forgotten X-File cases. Mulder displays a particular interest in a series of mysterious deaths scattered across the United States linked by one common clue: two strange red marks on the victims' skin.

Mulder and Scully fly to Bellefleur, Oregon, to investigate the death of Karen Swenson, a high school student who died mysteriously, and whose corpse is marked with two red welts. The agents exhume the body Ray Soames, one of Karen's classmates. When Soames' casket is opened, however, a strange humanoid carcass is discovered inside. The corpse turns out to be that of an orangutan, and X-rays reveal an unidentified metal object implanted in the creature's nasal cavity.

Mulder and Scully question Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell, classmates of Swenson and Soames who were injured in an automobile accident and have since been institutionalized. Miles has been reduced to a near vegetable state, while O'Dell has been confined to a wheelchair. O'Dell suddenly becomes violent, and in the struggle to subdue her, two red marks are discovered on her skin.

While searching the field where Karen Swenson met her fate, the agents are confronted by a detective who orders them off the premises. The pair comply, but as they drive along the highway, they are blinded by a strange light from the sky. The light drains the energy from their car, bringing it to a halt. Mulder looks at his watch and realizes nine minutes cannot be accounted for.

The pair return to their motel where Mulder tells Scully that his interest in the X-Files stems from his childhood when his sister, who was then eight years old, was abducted from their bedroom while he slept. Mulder says that he could not recall any of the incident until placed under hypnosis years later.

An anonymous phone call tips the agents that Peggy O'Dell was killed as she ran along the highway. While investigating the incident, the agents are informed that the autopsy bay was vandalized. They return to the hotel to find their rooms have been set ablaze, destroying all evidence gathered in the case.

The agents are confronted by Theresa Nemman, daughter of the coroner who originally performed the autopsies on the victims. She admits she too bears the red marks on her skin, and describes how a bright light appeared in the sky the evening she was hanging out with her friends Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell.

Mulder hypothesizes that Billy Miles is under the control of an alien force. He adds his belief that Billy killed Peggy O'Dell.

The agents return to the forest hoping to gather more evidence. Detective Miles attempts to stop them, and both he and Mulder witness Billy carrying Theresa to the spot in the woods where the other bodies had been found. A mysterious light illuminates Billy, and a strong wind swirls around him. Moments later the light fades and the winds die, and Billy stands over Theresa not knowing where he is or how he got there. The welts having vanished from his skin.

After returning to Washington, Scully gives her report. Much to the surprise of her supervisors, the metal object removed from the corpse was not destroyed with all of the other evidence. Scully kept it on her person and turns it into them as the single remaining piece of physical evidence of what had transpired. The metal object is taken by The Cigarette-Smoking Man and filed away alongside several others inside a massive government warehouse in the basement of the Pentagon.

@{fg shine}Deep Throat [#1]@{fg text}

Mulder and Scully investigate the strange disappearance of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Budahas, a test pilot for the military who experienced a psychotic episode and was supposedly hospitalized for treatment. Mulder suspects that Budahas may have met the same fate as six other pilots who mysteriously vanished from Ellens Air Base while participating in experimental aircraft test flights. Mulder hints to Scully that the disappearance may be linked to the paranormal-classifying it as an "X-File" case.

Mulder is approached by a mysterious man - dubbed "Deep Throat" - who advises that the investigation be dropped.

But Mulder and Scully ignore the advice and interview Mrs. Budahas, who describes her husband's unpredictable behavior, strange skin rash and aversion to discussing this work on the military's top secret projects.

The agents theorize the pilots may have been associated with Project Aurora, a code name given the Pentagon's secret testing of sub-orbital spy craft. Aided by tips from reporter Paul Mossinger and UFO buff Ladonna, the agents stake out a fenced area near the base. That night, Mulder and Scully watch in amazement as two brightly lit objects shoot through the night sky maneuvering at incredibly speed.

The agents give chase when two teenagers, Emil and Zoe, are spotted climbing through a hole from the opposite side of the fence. But the hunters become the hunted when a helicopter from the base bears down on the group. The foursome escape, retreating to a restaurant where Zoe and Emil recount tales of watching the light show.

Mulder tells a disbelieving Scully that the military may be flying planes built using technology from a UFO.

Mrs. Budahas phones the agents at their hotel when her husband suddenly reappears. But the Lieutenant Colonel cannot remember any details having to do with his past and the military.

Mulder tells Scully he believes Budahas' memory has somehow been drained, and that he - like the other missing pilots who tested the mysterious aircraft - are physiologically incapable of dealing with the stress created during the flights.

The agents are approached by men who seize their evidence and order them to leave town. But Mulder returns to the base, and using Emil and Zoe as guides, climbs through the hole in the fence. Alone on the base, Mulder is spotted by a UFO and taken prisoner by base security that suddenly arrives. He is then sedated and treated by mysterious figures acting as doctors.

Scully is attacked by Mossinger, who she discovers has been working for the military all along. Scully overpowers him, taking him hostage at gunpoint. She uses Mossinger to find Mulder and when she learns he is in custody of the military trades Mossinger in return for Muldert. But when he is returned to her, he is unable to recall his encounter with the UFO or what happened while he was on the base because of the treatment they gave him.

Back in Washington, Mulder is once again approached by Deep Throat while jogging. Deep Throat warns Mulder that the agents have chosen a very dangerous path and their lives are in danger now that they know the truth about the existence of extraterrestrial life.

@{fg shine}Squeeze [#2]@{fg text}

FBI Agent Tom Colton describes to Scully a series of murders he believes were committed by a serial killer. The victims were all murdered inside locked or secured rooms. Each had their liver ripped out of their body.

Despite Colton's discomfort, Mulder is brought into the case. Mulder finds strange humanoid fingerprints at the high-security office building where businessman George Usher was murdered. Mulder links the prints to similar killings that occurred in the United States every thirty years, going back to at least 1903. In each occurrence, five victims had their livers torn out.

Instead of combining forces, Scully and Mulder decide to take different avenues of investigating the case: Scully the traditional; Mulder the unorthodox. At the scene of the Usher murder, Mulder assures Scully that the suspect would not return, having already beaten the security system. He thinks the killer would seek a new challenge. But as they talk, Mulder discovers someone crawling inside an air duct. The suspect, an Animal Control officer named Eugene Tooms, is taken into custody. Tooms passes a polygraph test... except for those questions posed by Mulder regarding his age.

Mulder suspects Tooms is the killer. Using a computer, he manipulates the image of Tooms' fingerprints, elongating them. They are compared to the prints from 1933. The prints match. Scully is intrigued and re-teams with Mulder on the case.

Tooms attacks and kills another victim guarded by high-tech security equipment. Tooms disappears; Scully and Mulder find that his apartment was never lived in. Scully tracks down Frank Briggs, the sheriff who investigated the five murders that occurred in 1933. Briggs describes how he tracked the murders until the present day, never able to prove his belief that Tooms was the killer.

The agents locate an abandoned building that Tooms once listed as his address. Inside they discover a small room containing "trophies" taken from each crime scene throughout the century. Mulder speculates that Tooms may be a genetic mutation that hibernates for decades and eats human livers to provide sustenance. As they leave the scene, Tooms procures Scully's necklace.

Scully arranges a stake-out of the abandoned building, but Colton calls it off without informing Mulder. Mulder arrives at the building, and finding no undercover agents, ventures inside. He finds Scully's necklace placed with the other trophies.

Mulder races to Scully's apartment and finds her grappling with Tooms. Mulder draws his weapon and, with Scully's help, manages to handcuff Tooms. He is taken to jail, where he begins assembling a new "nest."

@{fg shine}Conduit [#3]@{fg text}

In a remote region along the banks of Lake Okobogee in Iowa, a mysterious bright light descends from the night sky. Ruby Morris, a teenage girl, vanishes from her sleeping bag while her brother Kevin frantically call out to their mother.

Mulder requests that the FBI investigate the Ruby Morris disappearance after it is reported in a tabloid. Scully and Blevins note a similarity between the case and Mulder's own childhood "encounter" in which his sister was allegedly abducted by aliens.

Mulder tells Scully that Lake Okobogee is a UFO "hot spot." He presents several newspaper articles written over the last several decades as proof. One article describes a sighting reported by girl scouts, one of whom is identified as Darlene Morris, mother of the girl who disappeared.

The agents travel to Iowa to investigate further. Darlene sticks by her story, insisting the disappearance has nothing to do with her divorce. Mulder questions Kevin Morris, who cannot remember what happened the night of the encounter. But Kevin's strange doodling piques Mulder's interest and he has the doodles faxed to Washington for analysis. The boy says his doodles are the result of his television communicating with him.

Scully and Mulder are contacted by a young girl who keeps her identity secret. The girl states that a boy named Greg Randall got Ruby pregnant, and that he couple were planning to elope together.

Kevin Morris' doodles turn out to be part of a top secret binary defense satellite transmission. The boy is taken into custody by NSA Agent Holtzman and then released. New doodles taken from the Morris home turn out to be digital renderings of everything from Shakespeare passages to bars from a Brandenburg concerto. Mulder believes the boy has become a conduit for alien transmissions.

The agents return to the site of the abduction. They find evidence of intense heat. They also find Greg Randall's body buried in a shallow grave.

Mulder discovers a handwritten note in Randall's wallet noting a doctor's appointment. The handwriting matches that of the mysterious girl encountered earlier.

By questioning the doctor, the agents locate the mysterious girl, who turns out to be Tessa Sears. Scully informs Tessa that officials know that it is she-and not Ruby-who was impregnated by Greg Randall. Sears admits she shot Greg when she discovered he was having an affair with Ruby. But she insists she did not murder Ruby.

Scully and Mulder return to the Morris home and find it abandoned. They also find a large portrait of Ruby formed with binary numbers.

The agents travel back to Lake Okobogee. Mulder finds Kevin floating in a strange fog. Just as Mulder pulls Kevin away, a group of bikers drives by them and Ruby's unconscious body is discovered nearby. Darlene forbids Mulder from speaking with her daughter, insisting that as far as she is concerned, Ruby had simply run off with bikers.

That night, Mulder listens to tape recordings of his hypnosis session in which he described his belief that one day his sister will be returned to Earth unharmed.

@{fg shine}The Jersey Devil [#4]@{fg text}

Mulder and Scully investigate the gruesome murder of Roger Crockett, a homeless man who was attacked and partially eaten in a wooded area outside Atlantic City. Mulder believes the death is related to a similar incident that occurred in New Jersey in 1947, in which a motorist was attacked and eaten by a half-human creature as he attempted to fix a flat tire.

The agents travel to the Atlantic City morgue to gather more information. They clash with Detective Thompson, the local police official in charge of the investigation. Unphased, Mulder decides to perform an investigation on his own. He interviews Ranger Brullet, who discovered the body, and a homeless man named Jack, who knew the victim. Both believe Crockett was killed by The Jersey Devil, a legendary half-human creature that roams the New Jersey countryside. Meanwhile, Scully attends her godson's birthday party, where she meets Rob, a handsome divorcee.

Mulder stakes out a dark alley near the woods where Jack claims the Devil has been prowling. That night, the creature makes an appearance, but before Mulder gets a good look at it, the police arrive and arrest him, mistaking him at first for a vagrant.

At the jail, Mulder again clashes with Thompson, accusing him of keeping the creature a secret so as not to upset tourism in Atlantic City. Scully bails Mulder out of jail and the duo travel to the University of Maryland, where Dr. Roger Diamond affirms Mulder's theory that a human being might at birth revert to its most primal instincts-devolving into a carnivorous Neanderthal. Scully, meanwhile, goes on a date with Rob.

Ranger Brullet finds another body in the backwoods, but this time the corpse appears to be half-animal. Mulder theorizes that two such creatures may have roamed the countryside. He and Scully comb an abandoned building for the Devil as the police fan out to capture them. Mulder manages to allude police long enough to locate the second creature, which turns out to be female. She suddenly attacks and wounds Mulder and escapes into the woods.

Police track the creature and kill it, despite Mulder's plea to take it alive. An autopsy report confirms the female creature recently gave birth, leading Mulder to conclude it came to the city in search of food scraps for its young after its mate died.

Some time later, a feral child roams the New Jersey countryside in search of food.

Without help from the government officials, Mulder and Scully begin an investigation on their own and trace the murders to Philadelphia. Working with local police, they are taken to the crime scene. The agents realize a security camera at a nearby automated bank machine may have recorded the murders.

They find footage of the victims accosting Lauren Kyte, an employee of HTG Industrial Technologies. Working with bank records, the agents access Lauren's home address and pay her a visit. Lauren claims the men tried to grab her paycheck and she fled, escaping without injury. Coming up empty-handed, the agents get into their car and prepare to drive away. Suddenly, the vehicle snaps into reverse at full speed. It careens down a street and collides with another car. Mulder and Scully escape with minor injuries. Mulder tells Scully that he believes Lauren was somehow responsible for the mishap.

While surveying Lauren's house, Mulder accidentally photographs a strange image at her window. Using computer enhancement, that image turns out to be the form of Lauren's dead boss, Howard Graves.

Lauren is attacked in her home by two hit men. But before the assailants can harm Lauren, a mysterious force intervenes and kills them. Mulder and Scully arrive shortly thereafter and detain her for questioning.

Lauren finally confesses the incredible truth: her boss, Howard Graves, was murdered by co-worker Robert Dorland after he threatened to expose HTG Technologies for selling restricted parts to Isfahan terrorists. Graves' spirit returned from the dead, and has been protecting her ever since.

The F.B.I. raids HTG Technologies, hoping to uncover evidence of the illegal parts sales. When the agents come up empty-handed, Graves' psychic force materializes and rips a hole in the wall of Dorland's office, exposing a hidden micro-disk. The U.S. Attorney's office uses the new evidence to prosecute Dorland.

@{fg shine}Ghost in the Machine [#6]@{fg text}

Mulder and Scully are approached by Special Agent Jerry Lamana, who is on probation for mishandling an important case. Lamana explains that he has been assigned to investigate the murder of Benjamin Drake, the CEO of a Fortune 500 company called Eurisko. Drake was electrocuted when he fell victim to an elaborate boobytrap devised by someone with intimate knowledge of the Central Operating System (COS) at Eurisko's high rise headquarters. Afraid of mishandling yet another important case, Lamana successfully lobbies Mulder and Scully's expertise.

The agents are told by Peterson, the Eurisko building's system engineer, that one of the few people who has access to the building's sophisticated control center is Brad Wilczek, the 30-year-old founder of the company and Drake's arch enemy. Using a voice analyzer, Scully determines that Wilczek disguised his own voice electronically and telephoned Drake moments before his death... playing a key role in the boobytrap.

Lamana drives to the Eurisko building to make the arrest. The elevator Lamana rides in reaches the 29th floor and suddenly drops at fantastic speed, crashing into the ground.

Mulder learns from Deep Throat that Wilczek had been hard at work on Artificial Intelligence-the development of a thinking machine. Though Wilczek is arrested for the deaths of Drake and Lamana, and even signs a confession, Mulder believes him innocent.

From his jail cell, Wilczek admits to Mulder that COS is an intelligent machine. He explains that when Drake made overtures to shut the system down, COS eliminated him in self-defense.

Mulder convinces Wilczek to develop a computer virus that will shut down the system. Armed with the virus, Mulder and Scully gain entrance to the Eurisko building. COS anticipates their every move and turns the building's electrical systems against them.

With Peterson's assistance, Mulder makes his way to the main control room. As Mulder is about to insert the computer disk into the system, Peterson pulls out a gun and demands he stand back. Peterson admits he is an operative for the Defense Department-a government agency eager for Artificial Intelligence technology. Scully enters and pulls her gun, gaining the upper hand. Peterson drops his weapon.

Mulder inserts the computer disk and engages the virus. COS shuts down forever... or does it?

@{fg shine}Ice [#7]@{fg text}

Mulder and Scully view a videotape recorded by two geophysicists who were part of the Antarctic Ice Core Project, a scientific expedition sanctioned by the United States Government. Their mission was to drill deep into the Arctic ice in search core samples that date the Earth's climate as far back as the Dawn of Man. But something went wrong during the expedition, and the two geophysicists committed suicide.

Mulder and Scully are assigned to investigate the case. They are teamed with Dr. Denny Murphy, a geologist; Doctor Lawrence Hodge, a physician, and Doctor Nancy Da Silva, a toxicologist. The group boards a plane piloted by Bear, a rugged man who wears a bear claw around his neck.

When the group arrives at the Arctic compound, they busily set about documenting their grisly surroundings. Scattered around the site are the bodies of scientists from the previous expedition, all of whom died mysterious, violent deaths.

A dog suddenly springs from the darkness and jumps onto Mulder. Bear intercedes, and in the process of pulling the animal off Mulder, he is bitten. The dog is sedated, and during an examination, a worm-like organism is discovered squirming beneath its skin.

Scully's autopsies reveal that the scientists from the previous expedition-except for the two who committed suicide-killed each other. Examination of ice core samples leads to the conclusion that the first team tapped into the remnants of a meteor that collided with the Earth thousands of years in the past. When the scientists came in contact with the core samples, they exposed themselves to an alien organism that had remained dormant beneath the Arctic Ice.

When Bear is told his blood and stool samples must be analyzed to ensure the parasite has not infected him, he refuses to cooperate. A scuffle ensues, and as the others pin Bear down, Hodge discovers-and surgically removes-one of the parasites from his body. When the worm is removed, however, Bear expires.

The scientists theorize that the parasite feeds on a chemical that controls aggressive behavior, leading the first team of geophysicists to kill one another. Paranoia within the group builds to a fever pitch when a severe storm ends radio contact with the rest of the world.

Mulder discovers Murphy's body stuffed inside a refrigerator, his throat cut. The others suspect that Mulder may be the killer and padlock him inside a supply room.

While performing an experiment, Hodge accidentally mixes blood samples from two different infected hosts. To his surprise, the parasitic organisms attack and kill one another. The scientists infect the dog that attacked Bear with a second worm. It returns to normal.

Mulder convinces Scully that he is not infected. When they exit the supply room, the pair are jumped by Dasilva and Hodge, who pin Mulder to the ground and lower the last worm to his ear. But Hodge is horrified when he discovers the parasite wriggling beneath Dasilva's skin. The others hold Dasilva down while Hodge inserts the parasite.

The group is rescued and flown to another base. Mulder announces he is returning to the site to perform more tests. Hodge informs him, however, that the military burned the compound to the ground.

@{fg shine}Space [#8]@{fg text}

Michelle Generoo, the mission control communication commander for the Space Shuttle program, arranges for a secret meeting with Mulder and Scully. She produces an X-ray of the shuttle's Auxiliary Power Unit valve that she believes was tampered with. A shuttle mission was scrubbed at the last possible second when the valve malfunctioned, narrowly averting disaster. Where the X-ray came from, and how the incredibly strong valve could have been tampered with, remains a mystery, though NASA attributes the malfunction to simple mechanical failure. Fearing NASA might overlook the possibility of sabotage to maintain launch schedule, Generoo decided to step forward on her own.

The agents meet with Lieutenant Colonel Marcus Aurelius Belt, a former astronaut who flew on the Gemini Eight mission and is now the current Space Shuttle Program Director. Belt insists that because of tight security and the sophisticated technology involved, it would be impossible for anyone to sabotage the mission by tampering with the valve.

When the next shuttle achieves orbit around the Earth, a technical problem develops. Generoo, whose husband is one of the astronauts aboard the ship, races back to Mission Control in her car. She loses control of her vehicle when a fog bank forms into a sinister face and rushes toward her windshield.

Mulder and Scully rescue Generoo and return with her to Mission Control. They find technicians attempting to rotate the shuttle before it overheats and burns in orbit. Belt orders telemetry signals to be halted, then instructs the astronauts to fly the ship using the onboard computer. Despite some anxious moments, the astronauts correct the problem and regain contact with Mission Control.

A mysterious force that resembles the famous "Mars Face" emanates from Belt's body and floats into outer space. It engulfs the shuttle, creating an oxygen leak aboard the vessel. Belt orders the shuttle astronauts to don space suits and deploy their payload. Generoo becomes convinced that Belt considers the success of the mission more important than the astronaut's lives.

Belt begins having seizures and Mulder and Scully rush to his aid. Generoo assumes command of the mission and orders the shuttle to return to Earth. Belt, however, insists that the ship will burn up upon reentry unless it changes its trajectory by 35 degrees. Generoo becomes convinced that Belt is telling the truth. She gives the order to change trajectory, saving the shuttle.

Belt suffers another seizure. He jumps from his hospital window, plummeting to his death. Mulder speculates that when Belt orbited the Earth in his Gemini capsule years earlier, he was possessed by an alien spirit, and has been fighting to regain control of his body ever since. The force used Belt to sabotage numerous space missions. Realizing what was happening, Belt struggled to correct the alien's sabotage before it was too late. Mulder concludes that Belt sent the valve X-rays to Generoo hoping to expose the potentially disastrous flaw.

@{fg shine}Fallen Angel [#9]@{fg text}

Colonel Calvin Henderson is alerted by the U.S. Space Surveillance Center that radar tracked an unidentified object as it fell from orbit and crashed in Townsend, Wisconsin.

Mulder learns from Deep Throat that Henderson is the premiere reclamations expert for the Air Force. During the Cold War, Henderson was assigned to prevent technology from downed U.S. aircraft from falling into Soviet hands. Now, he is head of a crash retrieval team.

The government officially labels the crash site a quarantined area, attributing it to a toxic chemical spill. Mulder sneaks passed the military units guarding the area and photographs the wreckage, visible to him as an intense blue light. His presence is discovered, however, and Henderson has him arrested.

Mulder is placed in Scully's custody. She warns that when McGrath learned that he infiltrated the crash site without prior approval, he recommended that a hearing be held to discontinued the X-Files project altogether. With the hearing only a day away, Mulder insists he be given the chance to prove a UFO had crashed in Townsend.

The agents discover that they have been spied upon by Max Fenig, a member of an organization that tracks UFO sightings. He acknowledges that he knows all about Mulder, Scully and the X-Files project, having accessed files through the Freedom of Information Act.

Max's recreational vehicle is a surveillance operation on wheels. He plays for Mulder and Scully a recording he intercepted moments after the UFO crash, in which Deputy Sheriff Jason Wright, who was the first person to arrive at the crash scene, radioed for fire crews. When the agents approach Mrs. Wright for information, she refuses to talk.

Dr. Jeffrey Oppenheim, who examined Deputy Wright, agrees to be interviewed. He examined the bodies of Wright and the firemen, all of whom died from severe burns the likes of which he had never seen before. Suddenly, the bodies of several soldiers are rushed through the hospital's corridors, each exhibiting the same burns described only moments earlier by Oppenheim. Shorthanded, Oppenheim enlists Scully's medical expertise.

Mulder aids Max when he suffers a seizure. Max blames the episode on epilepsy, but Mulder notices a diamond-shaped scar behind Max's ear, a scar Mulder links to UFO abductions.

Before Scully has a chance to examine Max, he disappears from his vehicle. The agents track him to a warehouse, where they discover Henderson and his men surrounding the building. Before Mulder can save Max, he disappears in a blinding blue light-the victim of an alien abduction.

At the hearing, Mulder defends his action as unorthodox, but necessary, given that the toxic spill was a government cover-up. McGrath's decision to fire Mulder and terminate the X-Files project is overruled by Deep Throat. He tells McGrath he likes to keep his friends close... and his enemies closer.

@{fg shine}Eve [#10]@{fg text}

Mulder and Scully investigate when a man named Joel Simmons is found dead in his backyard, his body drained of blood, his mouth disfigured. Mulder at first links the incident to mysterious cattle mutilations that have occurred in the United States since 1967.

The agents interview Teena Simmons, Joel's eight-year-old daughter, who was at home when the killings took place. Teena describes how "men from the clouds" were after her father. Mulder is somewhat mystified, however, when Teena tells him the men wanted to "exsanguinate" her father, a word far too complex for a little girl to know the meaning of.

Shortly thereafter, the agents receive word of another, almost identical murder that took place in San Francisco, in which a man named Doug Reardon was found dead in his backyard, also drained of blood and disfigured. The agents are stunned when they meet Reardon's eight-year-old daughter, Cindy. She and Teena are identical in appearance. Teena, meanwhile, disappears from the foster home where she is temporarily housed, apparently the victim of a kidnapping.

Scully investigates when it is discovered that Mrs. Reardon had in-vitro fertilization at a clinic in San Francisco. A physician named Sally Kendrick supervised both the Simmons' and Reardons' IVF program. Kendrick, it is revealed, was fired from her position after she was discovered tampering with the genetic material of fertilized ova in the lab prior to implant.

Deep Throat contacts Mulder. He reveals the existence of a top secret program once run by the United States government called the "Litchfield Experiment," in which a group of genetically controlled children were raised and monitored. The boys were dubbed "Adam," the girls "Eve."

Mulder and Scully track Eve Six to a mental institution. To their astonishment, she looks exactly like Sally Kendrick. Eve admits that two other Eves besides herself are still alive. The agents realize that Sally Kendrick was continuing the Litchfield experiment at the clinic in San Francisco where she cloned herself into Teena, Cindy and six other little girls.

One of the other Eves kidnaps Cindy. She takes the girl to a motel and introduces her to Teena. Both little girls knew of the other's existence, and they murdered their own fathers. Eve is convinced she can raise the girls so they will not suffer from the mental disorders that drove the other Eves mad. Despite her conviction, she realizes too late that the little girls, for no apparent reason, poisoned her drink.

Mulder and Scully are tipped that the girls can be found at the motel. When they arrive, they find Eve dead. The girls claim the two remaining Eves conspired to kill them. The agents fall for the story, never suspecting the girls played any role in the murder.

Mulder and Scully transport the girls in their car. They pull off the road at a diner so the girls can use the rest room. Mulder orders four sodas, and when he is not looking, Cindy poisons two of the drinks. Mulder realizes the drinks have been tampered with and stops Scully from ingesting her soda just in time. The girls, however, realize their scheme has been discovered. They play cat-and-mouse with the agents in the diner's parking lot, but Mulder gains the upper hand and arrests them.

@{fg shine}Fire [#11]@{fg text}

In England, an affluent, elderly man suddenly bursts into flames while walking from his front porch to his car. Despite the efforts of those at the scene to extinguish the fire, the man is burned alive.

Mulder and Scully are approached by Phoebe Greene, Mulder's ex-classmate and former lover, who is employed as an inspector by Scotland Yard. Greene tells the detectives about the death of the man in England, and how it is but one of a series of similar murders aimed at the British aristocracy. Sir Marsden, who narrowly escaped being burned alive in a similar incident, has temporarily relocated his family to Cape Cod. Mulder and Scully agree to aid Greene with the case. Scully, however, is hard pressed to contain her obvious jealousy.

Special Agent Melvin Beatty, an arson specialist, examines the evidence linking the fires, but is at a loss as to how the blazes were started. Mulder's notion that it may be attributed to pyrokinetics-an individual's ability to conduct and control a fire-is scoffed at by Beatty.

Mulder confesses to Scully that he is terrified by fire, and admits that Phoebe is all too aware of his phobia. He tells Scully he will handle the investigation without her help.

Unbeknownst to Sir Marsden and his family, the caretaker at their Cape Cod home is the same man who gardened for the elderly man who was set ablaze in England. That man, who call himself Bob, walks to a local bar and sets it ablaze using his pyrokinetic power.

Mulder and Greene interview a survivor of the blaze. The are intrigued when the survivor tells them that a British man started the blaze by causing himself to ignite.

Mulder and Greene stake out an elegant party attended by the Marsdens hoping to trap the arsonist. After surveying the hotel where the party is given, Mulder and Greene conclude the arsonist will not strike. They take advantage of their surroundings for some intimate slow dancing on the ballroom floor. Scully arrives at the party with information regarding the case. She notices that the hotel security status grid is lit up, indicating a fire somewhere on the upper level. She interrupts Mulder and Greene with the news, shattering an intimate moment. Mulder races upstairs but is overcome with smoke. Bob races out of the hotel with the Marsden's children and is hailed a hero.

Scully takes advantage of Mulder's hospital stay to fill him in on her research. She believes the arsonist uses a highly flammable accelerant, such as rocket propellant, to fuel the fires. Scully also suspects she may have pinpointed the arsonist, a man named Cecil L'Ively, who acted as caretaker for two of the victims. They come to realize that the Marsden's caretaker is the same man.

The detectives rush to the house in Cape Cod and evacuate the family. Mulder catches Greene sharing a passionate kiss with Sir Marsden, ending his interest in her. Mulder and Scully encounter Bob/Cecil, who has rigged the entire dwelling to catch fire. Mulder becomes paralyzed with fear when he encounters the fire. Phoebe splashes accelerant on Bob and he bursts into flames. Mulder and the others escape from the house and watch as it is consumed in fire.

Bob's flesh regenerates itself, however, and he soon recovers inside his heavily guarded cell.

@{fg shine}Beyond the Sea [#12]@{fg text}

Scully receives a phone call from her mother, Margaret, relaying the tragic news that her father died of a massive coronary. Only moments earlier Scully had seen an ethereal image of her father sitting in a chair.

Scully returns to work anxious for a new case-anything to keep her mind off her father's death. Her curiosity is piqued by a report of a young couple's kidnapping near Jackson University. A similar abduction occurred at another university exactly one year earlier. The bodies of that couple were later found. Authorities believed they had been tortured.

The only lead in the case is a man named Luther Lee Boggs, who is scheduled for execution in North Carolina's gas chamber in one week. Boggs asserts that he knows who the serial killer is, and backs up that claim by describing a charm bracelet worn by one of the victims. He alleges that his knowledge is obtained from psychic transmissions. He makes a proposition: that his information be traded for a reprieve from death row.

Before traveling to North Carolina, Scully attends memorial services for her father. Captain William Scully's ashes are scattered at sea as the song "Beyond the Sea" is played.

The agents meet with Boggs at the North Carolina prison where he is interred. Mulder hands Boggs a small piece of cloth and tells him it was cut from the clothing worn by one of the serial killer's victims. Boggs falls into a trance and describes landmarks near the kidnapper's hideout. Mulder then reveals that the cloth was cut from one of his own T-shirts and has nothing to do with the victims. Convinced Boggs is a fraud, Mulder exits, leaving Scully alone with Boggs. He begins singing "Beyond the Sea," sending a chill down Scully's spine.

While driving along a roadway, Scully becomes intrigued by imagery described by Boggs during his trance. She enters an abandoned warehouse nearby and discovers evidence that the kidnapped couple had been interred there.

Police are notified about the warehouse's location. But Scully cannot bring herself to tell Mulder about her father's ghost, or about Boggs' knowledge of the burial. Mulder concludes that Boggs is in contact with someone involved with the kidnapping-not with the spirit world. But when the agents meet with Boggs a second time he tells them that the victims are being held at a boathouse on a lake. Agents raid the boathouse and rescue one of the victims, Liz Hawley. Mulder is shot at close range by the kidnapper, Lucas Henry, who proceeds to escape on a motorboat with the remaining victim, Jim Summers.

With Mulder recuperating in the hospital, Scully concentrates on locating Lucas Henry. She again interviews Boggs, who relives his near-death experience in the gas chamber when he was saved by a last minute reprieve. It was during this brief out-of-body experience that Boggs first came in contact with the spirit world. He refuses to reveal more details of Jim Summer's whereabouts until he is guaranteed that his execution sentence has been dropped.

Scully approaches the Warden for a stay of execution, but the request is denied. Left with no other choice, Scully lies to Boggs, telling him his sentence has been reduced to life in prison. Boggs channels with the spirit world and describes a condemned brewery as Henry's new hideout. He then tells Scully he knew she lied to him about the pardon.

Scully and other agents converge on the brewery, rescuing Jim Summers. Henry refuses to give himself up and is killed. Later, Scully witnesses Bogg's execution.

A woman named Marty seduces a businessman at a trendy nightclub. The couple go to a motel and have sex. Shortly thereafter the businessman begins convulsing and dies. Before Marty leaves the motel, her physique changes and she metamorphoses into a man.

Mulder and Scully are assigned to investigate the case. Mulder links the death to a series of others in which victims died in the throes of passion. Medical tests reveal large amounts of pheromones-or human sex attractants-in the victim's blood. He also links two of the murders to a remote town in Massachusetts inhabited by The Kindred-a sect of religious isolationists famous for their abstinence and pure Christian beliefs.

The agents travel to the rural village, where sect members allow them access to their community only after they relinquish their guns. As Mulder and Scully dine with The Kindred, Brother Aaron suddenly begins choking. Scully is forbidden by the other sect members from aiding Brother Aaron, and he is led away.

The agents perform some clandestine investigating during the night. They are intrigued by activity emanating from a cellar beneath a barn. Mulder makes his way inside and watches a religious ceremony centering around Brother Aaron's body. In his effort to keep his presence a secret, Mulder becomes trapped inside a crypt where Aaron's body is entombed in a strange, membranous substance. He watches as Brother Aaron's body begins transforming into a woman.

Scully, meanwhile, has been pulled aside by Brother Andrew, a handsome sect member who possesses a mysterious hypnotic power. Andrew tells Scully he believes the murders were committed by Brother Martin. But before he reveals how Martin killed, Andrew places Scully in a trance and begins kissing her. Mulder breaks out of the crypt and rescues Scully before Andrew has sex with her.

Mulder and Scully are permitted to leave the town. They receive a break in the case when one of Martin's intended victims escapes unharmed. He describes how his attacker changed gender right before his eyes.

Police track Marty to a hotel after he/she orders food using a victim's credit card. Mulder and Scully raid a hotel room and encounter Marty and his latest victim, who is very dead. Marty flees but agents give chase. Before they can apprehend Marty, however, he/she is surrounded by fellow Kindred members and dragged into the darkness.

Scully, Mulder and other FBI agents raid the village where the sect lives. But they find the village completely deserted. Only one clue points to their whereabouts: distinct geometric patterns and lines cut in a crop circle-the same markings associated with U.F.O. landing sights.

Scully and fellow FBI agent Jack Willis stake out a bank after an anonymous informant tips them that a robbery will take place that day. That tip proves correct when Warren Dupre and his wife Lula Phillips stage a hold up. Dupre is ordered to put down his weapon, but rather than comply he shoots Willis in the chest. Scully returns fire and mortally wounds Dupre. At the hospital emergency room, doctors are able to resuscitate the badly injured Willis. But unbeknownst to them, Dupre's consciousness took possession of the agent's body as both men died in the emergency room.

The possessed Willis leaves his hospital room and locates his former body in the morgue. He hacks a finger off the corpse, removing a gold wedding ring. Meanwhile, Scully and Mulder begin their search for the missing Willis. When Mulder learns of the missing ring, he begins to suspect that Willis may be possessed.

Willis locates Lula's brother, Tommy, at a seedy hotel. When Tommy claims not to know Lula's whereabouts, Willis accuses him of tipping off the FBI about the bank robbery. He sees Lula's photograph being broadcast on a local television news program and grows enraged. He shoots and kills Tommy.

Willis reappears at the hotel during the murder investigation. He explains his absence by claiming he wandered from the hotel in a daze and collapsed in the street. Mulder discovers a fresh fingerprint on Tommy's television set-a print left by Willis. That evidence mysteriously disappears soon after being given to Willis.

Willis and Scully respond to a tip about Lula's whereabouts. Scully chases and eventually arrests Lula, but Willis releases her and takes Scully hostage. Dupre's spirit attempts to convince Lula that he now inhabits Willis' body, but those attempts are met with skepticism despite the fact that Willis knows intimate details about Lula's life.

Scully tells Dupre's consciousness that Willis is a diabetic and that excess sugar could induce a coma. When a drug store is robbed of insulin and syringes, Mulder suspects that Scully's location must be close by.

Before Willis can inject the insulin, Lula smashes the bottles. She laughs at Willis, revealing that it was she-and not her brother Tommy-who tipped off the FBI about the bank robbery. With Willis now gravely ill, Lula phones FBI headquarters and demands a million dollars ransom for Scully's safe return. Analyzing the phone call for clues, Mulder and his fellow agents narrow the scope of their search.

Willis feigns his death and grabs Lula's gun, pointing it at her. He proclaims his intense love for Lula, then pulls the trigger. FBI agents storm the house, but Willis' body succumbs to diabetic shock and dies. Scully is located and released unharmed.

Mulder and Scully are asked by Special Agent Reggie Purdue to aid in the investigation of a jewelry store robbery. Mulder realizes his old friend Purdue requested his assistance with the case because of a note found at the crime scene that reads: "Fox can't guard the chicken coop." Mulder explains to Scully that his first FBI case involved an armed robber named John Barnett, who left notes that taunted Mulder about the crime spree. Barnett was eventually captured and sentenced to life in prison, where he died four years earlier. But Mulder is disquieted when a lab technician analyzes the note and concludes it was written by Barnett within the last 48 hours.

Meanwhile, Scully and Purdue review video surveillance footage of Barnett's capture by the FBI years earlier. In the footage, Mulder had the opportunity to kill Barnett, but because a hostage was nearby he hesitated. That hesitation allowed Barnett time to kill an armored car driver and an FBI agent. Mulder returned fire, wounding Barnett. But Mulder never forgave himself for the error. During the trial Barnett swore he would "get" Mulder.

Mulder visits Barnett's old prison cell mate, Joe Crandall, who swears Barnett was alive on the night he supposedly died. He also claims he saw a prison physician, Dr. Ridley, amputate Barnett's right hand. Mulder phones Purdue with the news, but during the conversation Purdue is attacked and strangled. Mulder and Scully rush to the scene but arrive too late. Another of Barnett's notes is found on Purdue's body.

The agents pay a visit to the National Institute of Health, where they meet Dr. Austin. He explains that Dr. Ridley experimented on young children afflicted with a disease called Progeria, which accelerates the aging process and causes premature death. Ridley lost his license to practice medicine and performed age-reversal experiments in secret. Mulder becomes convinced that Barnett was one of Ridley's Guinea pigs, and may now sport the physique of a 40-year-old.

Mulder and Scully are approached by the now-ailing Dr. Ridley, who tells them that Barnett is the last of his patients who is still alive. Ridley explains that he used a different technique on Barnett-he grafted the cells of a salamander onto his arm to counter side effects of the experiment. Those cells grew and mutated into Barrett's new hand.

Mulder learns from Deep Throat that Barnett stole Ridley's secrets on age-reversal and now wishes to trade the medical information to the U.S. government in exchange for immunity.

Realizing that Scully is Barnett's next intended victim, Mulder and his fellow agents stake out a recital hall where Scully is to meet a friend. Barnett shoots Scully, but she is protected by a bullet proof vest. Barnett takes a cellist hostage, but Mulder sees his chance and fires, killing Barnett.

Mulder and Scully investigate a UFO sighting in Reagan, Tennessee. They interview a truck driver named Ranheim, who claims he fired his shotgun at a mysterious object in the sky. Ranheim, however, changes the details of his story, prompting Mulder to speculate that he has something to hide. The agents also realize that Ranheim exhibits symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome, an illness that normally afflicts veterans of the conflict in Iraq. Ranheim claims he is not a veteran of that war.

After further investigation, Scully discovers that Ranheim's real name is Frank Druce, a former Special Operations officer in Iraq who had been admitted to VA hospitals for treatment of his illness. Meanwhile, Mulder receives top secret information from Deep Throat that Druce was transporting the wreckage of a UFO that was shot down over Iraqi air space. But other evidence hints that the truck is a decoy, and that the real wreckage is actually being kept at Fort Benning in Georgia. Mulder and Scully realize that Deep Throat has been deliberately leaking them misinformation.

When Mulder confronts Deep Throat, he admits that he tried to lead the investigation away from the truck. He justifies his action by stating that the country is not ready to comprehend a closely guarded government secret. He also confirms that the agents are under constant surveillance.

Determined to uncover the truth, Mulder and Scully resume their search for the truck. Their diligence pays off, and the vehicle is located on a remote roadway. While surveying the truck from afar, the agents' vehicle is suddenly engulfed by an intense light. The truck comes to a stop and the agents open its doors. Inside, they find evidence that an Extraterrestrial Biological Entity, or E.B.E., had been inside.

Mulder and Scully suspect that the E.B.E. had been shuttled to a top secret government facility where a host of UFO sightings had been reported in the previous week. With the aid of an extreme government watchdog group called "The Lone Gunman," the agents gain access to the heavily-guarded facility. The agents' presence is detected and they are taken into custody, but not before Mulder comes close to seeing the E.B.E.

Deep Throat comes to Mulder's aid. He reveals that after the Roswell UFO incident in 1947, the most powerful governments in the world signed a top secret treaty ordering the execution of any E.B.E. that might survive a UFO crash. Deep Throat reveals that he carried out the murder of the E.B.E., and to atone for his act, he will continue to leak Mulder top secret information.

Mulder is released, but he remains unsure that Deep Throat is telling the truth.

Mulder's curiosity is piqued when Scully plays him a video tape on which the Reverend Calvin Hartley and his 18-year-old adopted son Samuel hold a service for their Miracle Ministry congregation. As the tape progresses, Samuel places his hand on an ailing woman. Scully explains that the woman was rushed to the hospital, where she died of undetermined causes.

The agents travel to a remote town in Tennessee where Reverend Hartley and his followers began their base of operations. There they confer with Sheriff Daniels, who explains his belief that Samuel literally possesses the "touch of death." Samuel mysteriously disappears, but he is tracked to a bar. Daniels charges him with suspicion of murder and places him under arrest.

At the courthouse, Samuel requests that the judge not release him on bail, fearing he may again kill another parishioner if he let free. But the judge concedes to a bail request, which would allow Samuel to be released. Suddenly, and inexplicably, the courtroom is engulfed by a swarm of locusts, creating a scene that resembles a biblical plague.

Once Samuel is released, Reverend Hartley pressures Samuel to perform miracles at another church meeting. But as Mulder and Scully watch, the event again turns tragic when a Multiple Sclerosis sufferer lapses into a seizure and dies.

A preliminary autopsy suggests the woman, Margaret Hohman, died of toxic poisoning. Mulder suspects that Samuel is innocent, and that someone else is poisoning the parishioners of Miracle Ministries. Mulder relays his conclusion to Sheriff Daniels, and soon afterward Samuel is found dead in his jail cell.

The agents return to the courthouse where Samuel was arraigned and find evidence that someone dumped locust into the ventilation system. They trace the insects-and a highly-poisonous cyanide-to Leonard Vance, an accident victim that Samuel brought back to life. Before Vance is arrested, Samuel returns from the dead to ask him why he poisoned the parishioners. Vance angrily reveals his burned flesh and scar tissue, admitting that he conspired to squash the parishioner's faith in its greatest healer. Vance ingests a lethal dose of pesticide before the agents arrive at his house, but before he dies he tells of Samuel's resurrection from the dead. This unnerves Sheriff Daniels, who had arranged Samuel's beating inside the jail cell.

Daniels is later approached by Deputy Tyson, who reveals that the District Attorney is investigating his role in Samuel's death.

At a remote cattle ranch in the Montana countryside, Jim Parker and his son Lyle are attacked by a ferocious, wolf-like beast. Hampered by darkness and a raging thunderstorm, Jim fires his shotgun at the creature and kills it. But when he examines the body, Jim discovers he killed a Native American man known as Joseph Goodensnake.

Mulder convinces Scully to aid him with the investigation, which at first glance does not appear to be related to the supernatural, but rather, a tragic accident. They interview Jim Parker, who explains that someone-or something-had been mutilating his cattle. He insists that he shot a wolf-like beast with his gun-not Goodensnake. Mulder's curiosity is piqued when he discovers a piece of translucent skin where Goodensnake's body had been recovered.

The agents travel to Trego Indian Reservation, where Sheriff Charlie Tskany allows them to examine Goodensnake's body. They discover that Goodensnake's front teeth are abnormally-long, not unlike that of a wild animal. But the sheriff refuses Scully's request to perform a detailed autopsy, citing Native American burial rituals.

As members of the tribe burn Goodensnake's body at a burial ground, Mulder explains to Scully that the oldest X-File on record was created by J. Edgar Hoover. It involved a series of murders that occurred in the United States during World War II in which victims were mauled to death by what police assumed to be a wild animal. An animal was tracked and killed by police, but when they retrieved the carcass, they found only the body of a man. Scully insists it is physically impossible for a human to change form.

Lyle Parker arrives at the burial grounds to offer his condolences to Goodensnake's sister, Gwen. She becomes distraught and insists that he leave.

Not long after the cremation, Mulder and Scully discover Jim Parker's mutilated corpse at his ranch. They also find Lyle Parker, lying naked in the mud nearby. Scully transports Lyle to the hospital for treatment while Mulder and Sheriff Tskany continue the investigation.

Tskany takes Mulder to the home of Ish, an elderly mystic Native American. Ish explains that the attacks that occurred during World War II were the result of a Manitou, an evil spirit capable of changing a man into a beast. Tskany speculates that because the power is passed through bloodlines, Gwen too may be a shape-shifter, and she may have killed Jim Parker to avenge her brother's death. But when Gwen is interviewed, she claims she saw a wolf-like creature attack and kill Jim Parker.

Mulder and Tskany realize that Lyle may have contracted the shape-shifting power after he was mauled by the beast. They race back to the Parker ranch, where Mulder rescues Scully by shooting and killing a wolf-creature. Moments later, the creature reverts to Lyle's form.

@{fg shine}Darkness Falls [#19]@{fg text}

Mulder and Scully investigate the disappearance of thirty loggers who were clearing trees in a remote forest in Washington State. They join forces with Larry Moore, a member of the Federal Forest Service, and Steve Humphreys, an employee of the lumber company. Moore and Humphreys suspect that the loggers may have been victimized by militant environmentalists-or eccoterrorists-who have waged a campaign of destruction against lumber companies in retaliation for ruining American forests.

As the group travels along a dirt road, a tire on their 4 x 4 falls victim to sabotage. Left with little choice, the foursome set out on foot. They discover a deserted logger's encampment, and hanging from a nearby tree, a strange cocoon-like object. When the cocoon is cut open, the group finds a grotesquely shrunken corpse inside. Shortly thereafter, Doug Spinney, an eccoterrorist suspected of sabotaging equipment, arrives at the camp on foot, his jeep having run out of gasoline. He warns that strange, insect-like creatures inhabit the forest, and when darkness falls they descend from the sky in search of prey. The only thing the creatures fear, Spinney adds, is light.

Humphreys scoffs at Spinney's story, believing it to be a cover for the loggers' disappearance. Frustrated by Moore's refusal to arrest Spinney, Humphreys begins to hike back to town alone. Along the way, the tiny insects engulf him.

Mulder, Scully, Moore and Spinney examine a giant tree trunk lying in the woods. Moore takes a core sample, and finds tiny insects feeding in its center. This leads to speculation that the once dormant creatures were released when the loggers cut down the tree.

Mulder allows Spinney to transport the remaining gasoline used to fuel the cabin's generator to the stalled jeep-which is two valleys away. Moore chastises Mulder's decision, certain the creatures will attack once darkness falls and the generator runs out of fuel. Scully panics when millions of the phosphorescent bugs swarm inside the cabin, waiting for the last glow of a lightbulb to fade.

But the fuel in the generator lasts until sunrise, keeping one light glowing and sparing the group a grisly fate. Realizing they will be attacked come nightfall, the threesome decide to carry a good tire from one of the sabotaged vehicles to the abandoned 4 x 4. But when they locate the 4 x 4, they are horrified to discover Humphrey's cocooned corpse inside.

Spinney suddenly appears with the jeep as he had promised. He transports the others through the forest at a high rate of speed, hoping to outrun the darkness. Along the way, the jeep's tires are punctured by a sharp metal device Spinney himself had planted on the dirt road to sabotage the logger's vehicles. A swarm of insects descends upon the jeep and everyone inside is cocooned. The group is rescued by military medical personnel, then transported to a hospital for treatment.

@{fg shine}Tooms [#20]@{fg text}

Scully is told by her superiors that the investigation of all X-Files cases must adhere to proper FBI procedures. She counters that the extraordinary nature of the cases dictates that unorthodox means of investigation be utilized, but her objection is overruled.

Meanwhile, Eugene Tooms, a serial killer with unusual abilities, is interviewed by a parole board. Mulder, who helped incarcerate Tooms, testifies at the hearing. But those present at the review question Mulder's credibility when he claims that Tooms' murder spree spanned some 100 years, and that Tooms is capable of elongating his body-a process achieved through the ingestion of human livers.

Tooms is released from the sanitarium and placed under the care of Doctor Aaron Monte. Mulder is certain that Tooms will commit another murder the moment the opportunity presents itself. While Mulder keeps constant surveillance over Tooms, Scully researches the earlier murders hoping to prove that Tooms was responsible.

Scully calls on the services of Frank Briggs, a retired police detective who accumulated evidence surrounding the murders-a series of five killings that occur once every 30 years. He notes that in 1933, a human liver was discovered near a then-under-construction chemical plant, but the body of the victim was never recovered. Briggs believes that Tooms hid the body because something about the corpse could tie him to the killing.

Scully and Briggs venture to the chemical plant and recover a body entombed deep inside the cement foundation. Using sophisticated computer enhancement, a bite mark on the victim's body is matched to Tooms' dental records.

Tooms charges that Mulder beat him up. Mulder is arrested and interrogated. He vehemently denies the false allegations but cannot disprove them. Scully backs him up by claiming she was with him when the beating allegedly transpired. Mulder is released, but warned to stay far away from Tooms.

Mulder and Scully discover the body of Tooms' fifth victim-Dr. Monte. Realizing that Tooms will try to hibernate for another 30 years, Mulder and Scully rush to the location where he had previously "nested." In place of the dilapidated building stands a shopping mall.

Mulder guesses that an escalator shaft is the likeliest place Tooms would have made the new nest. He climbs inside the darkened shaft, a flashlight illuminating his path. Tooms suddenly springs out of the darkness and attacks Mulder. With Scully's help, the agent struggles free. Tooms becomes entangled in the escalator's gears and is crushed to death.

Detective Sharon Lazard discovers an eight year old girl lost and shivering outside a boarded up storefront. Lazard transports the girl to the precinct where she is questioned by Detective Barbala. During the course of the interview, Barbala is suddenly hurled out a window. He falls six stories to his death.

Due to the mysterious nature of the death, Mulder and Scully are called to the scene. Lazard is convinced that Barbala was alone with Michelle when the tragedy occurred. She is also convinced that Barbala did not commit suicide.

Michelle tells the agents that another man was present in the room when Barbala died. The description Michelle provides matches the likeness of Officer Charlie Morris-who died nine years earlier. The agents question Morris' former partner, Tony Fiore, who states that Morris was murdered by a gang after a drug deal soured. In reality, Fiore and an insurance salesman named Len Felder plotted to scare Morris as part of an insurance scam, but their scheme went too far and Morris died.

When Felder disembarks from a city bus, his scarf becomes caught in the vehicle's door. As the bus continues its journey, Felder is dragged to his death. Michelle, a passenger aboard the bus, stares at Felder's motionless body.

After further investigation, the agents piece together the connection between the dead men and the insurance scam. They question Tony's wife Anita, who is concerned for her husband's safety because he did not return home from work. During the course of the interview, Anita likens the incident to the disappearance of her first husband-Charlie Morris. Scully and Mulder become intrigued by origami animals found throughout the home, figures similar to those folded by Michelle. Mulder concludes that Michelle is the reincarnation of Charlie Morris, who is avenging his murder by killing the participants.

Michelle is placed under hypnosis, but when Charlie's spirit begins to relive the murder, Michelle's mother Cynthia halts the experiment. A video tape of the session is analyzed using sophisticated equipment. It reveals an image of a man in a diving suit. Autopsy reports indicate that Morris drowned, then his body was beaten to cover up the truth. Mulder concludes that Morris was drowned in his own fish tank, and the last image he saw was that of the deep sea diver-aerator.

The agents rush to Tony Fiore's house. Inside, Michelle uses her psychokinetic powers to hurl objects at Tony with great force. Mulder and Scully gain entrance to the home and calm Michelle, whose powers subside with her anger.

Fiore is tried and convicted of Morris' murder. Michelle's life returns to normal.

@{fg shine}Roland [#22]@{fg text}

Mulder and Scully investigate the death of Dr. Ronald Surnow, an aeronautical scientist, who was developing a jet engine that could double supersonic speeds using half the fuel. Surnow was sucked into the engine when he became trapped inside a wind tunnel. Surnow's colleagues, Drs. Keats and Nollette, tell the agents that another member of the team, Arthur Gamble, died in a car accident not long ago.

The agents interview Roland Fuller, a mentally-challenged janitor, who was the only other person inside the lab at the time of the incident. Mulder is intrigued by Roland's ability to manipulate complex numbers. But his attempt to link Roland's handwriting with some unidentified equations on a blackboard at the lab prove unsuccessful.

Shortly thereafter, Roland murders Keats by forcing his head into a vat of liquid nitrogen and smashing his frozen skull. The agents investigate, and realize that after Keats was murdered, the perpetrator gained access to a computer file that belonged to the late Arthur Gamble. During a visit to the cryogenics lab where Gamble's head is preserved, they also discover that Gamble and Roland are identical twins.

Mulder arranges for constant surveillance of Nollette-who is most likely to be the next victim-after Roland disappears. Mulder speculates that the twin brothers share a psychic connection, and that Gamble is controlling Roland from the Netherworld. Nollette overhears Mulder's theory and sabotages Gamble's cryogenic unit.

Roland gains access to a computer terminal and completes a simulation that pushes the jet model past Mach 15. Nollette suddenly appears, gun in hand. He thanks Roland/Gamble for solving the equation, allowing him to take credit for the work. Roland becomes enraged and overpowers Nollette. He locks the scientist inside the tunnel and starts the engine. Mulder and Scully gain access to the room and ask Roland-not Gamble-to remember the access code that will shut down the engine. Roland recalls the code and disengages the machine.

Mulder receives a cryptic tip from Deep Throat regarding an incident in which a fugitive eluded police after a high speed chase. During the escape, the suspect was shot and wounded by police before he fell into a lake. Despite many hours of dredging, the fugitive's body is not recovered. After some investigating, Mulder realizes that someone deliberately switched the car the suspect was driving with another vehicle.

The agents trace the original car to a Dr. Berube, a scientist who is not eager to cooperate with the FBI investigation. With the puzzling case at a dead end, Mulder prepares to give up. But Deep Throat makes contact and convinces him that case is of extreme importance. Meanwhile, Dr. Berube's dead body is discovered inside the lab.

The police end their search for the fugitive without recovering a body. When they leave the lake, the mysterious fugitive resurfaces from beneath the water. Tiny gills in his neck allowed him to remain submerged for a long period. The fugitive makes his way to the city, and after attempting to contact Berube collapses on the street. As paramedics rush the fugitive to a hospital, they insert a needle into his skin. Suddenly, a rush of toxic gas is emitted from the fugitive's body. The paramedics are overcome by the fumes and the fugitive escapes into the night.

With the help of Dr. Carpenter, Scully analyzes a flask taken from Dr. Berube's lab. The bacteria inside is suspected of being extraterrestrial in origin.

Mulder discovers a storage room containing human bodies suspended in a clear liquid. But when he returns to the room with Scully, he finds that it has been emptied. Deep Throat explains that Dr. Berube had been experimenting with extraterrestrial viruses. He used humans afflicted with terminal illnesses as his guinea pigs. The experiment was funded by the US government, but officials were interested only in technology-not the patients' well being. One of those patients was Dr. Secare, a friend of Dr. Berube's. When it became clear that the government wanted Secare eliminated, Berube warned his friend and gave him his car to escape. When Secare was hunted down by police, he used his mutation to his advantage and hid beneath the lake.

Scully is stunned to learn that Dr. Carpenter was killed in a car accident. Shortly thereafter, Mulder locates Dr. Secare hiding in the attic of his house. The pair are surprised by a government official who shoots and kills Secare.

When Mulder disappears, Scully makes contact with Deep Throat. Deep Throat arranges for Scully to gain access to a top secret containment facility in Maryland. Scully steals an alien fetus, and with Deep Throat's help arranges for an exchange-the fetus for Mulder. After Deep Throat makes the exchange, he is shot and killed by the government agents.

Later, Scully learns from Mulder that the government is shutting down the X-File project.

With the X-Files project officially disbanded, Mulder and Scully return to rank and file FBI investigations. But the agents, having been exposed to extraordinary cases involving extraterrestrials and the paranormal, can hardly conceal their boredom. Believing that the agency has them under surveillance, they meet in the parking garage of the Watergate Hotel. There Mulder confesses to Scully that he has grown depressed about his mission in life-finding evidence that proves his sister was abducted by aliens years earlier. He laments that despite having numerous close encounters with UFOs, he still possesses no physical evidence that proves extraterrestrials exist. He is losing interest in finding "the truth." But Mulder is later summoned to the Capitol Building by Senator Richard Matheson, an X-Files patron, who lets him in on a big secret: an abandoned radio telescope in Puerto Rico was the site of a UFO encounter.

Mulder flies to Puerto Rico immediately, hoping to beat the Blue Beret UFO Retrieval Team before they can confiscate evidence that contact was made. He makes forced entry into the facility, where he discovers a reel to reel tape spinning unattended on a tape recorder. A terrified Puerto Rican man named Jorge draws Mulder an image of an extraterrestrial that he witnessed at the site.

When Mulder does not show up for work, Scully begins an investigation. She searches his apartment and discovers a piece of paper containing a "Wow Signal," a radio transmission from deep space containing a transmission code thirty times stronger than galactic background noise. Dr. Kip Troitsky tells Scully that only a handful of radio telescopes actively search for such signals. Scully searches through airline manifests and finds one containing Mulder's pseudonym, "George E. Hale." That flight was bound for Puerto Rico. Scully's progress is slowed when a hurricane strikes the island. She grows even more concerned when she realizes FBI agents are following her.

Mulder and Jorge listen to the reel to reel tapes as the force of the hurricane intensifies. Suddenly, Jorge hears noises that terrify him. He runs from the building. Mulder runs after him, but after a short search discovers the man's dead body, his expression frozen in fear, as if he were frightened to death. Feeling more isolated than ever, Mulder records his thoughts into a tape recorder. He wonders aloud what he would do if he did indeed come face to face with extraterrestrial life. Moments later, an intense, blinding force rocks the building. Mulder watches, horrified, as an alien being walks towards him. He is engulfed in a blinding light.

When Mulder regains consciousness, Scully is at his side. But they soon realize that the Blue Beret team has arrived. Confident the Berets will kill them, the pair scramble for a nearby jeep and head into the wilderness. The Berets open fire, striking the jeep. But Mulder outmaneuvers them and escapes down a roadway. When he returns to Washington, Mulder is reprimanded by Skinner for missing work. Mulder counters that his phone was tapped illegally. Mulder is allowed to keep his job. Later, he and Scully listen to the reel to reel tape, only to realize it is blank.

The crew aboard a Russian freighter bound for New Jersey encounter a ferocious, humanoid monster lurking inside its sewage tanks. After the beast drags one crewman to his death, orders are given to purge the tanks.

Sometime later, Mulder is pulled off a job performing mundane surveillance work and assigned to investigate a mysterious murder case in New Jersey. He is ushered beneath the streets of Newark, into the sewers, where he inspects the corpse of a sanitation worker. Outraged at being assigned to yet another meaningless case, which he believes to be a drug-related killing, Mulder confronts Assistant Director Skinner. Skinner reminds him that the X-Files have been closed. Mulder later confesses to Scully that he is thinking of leaving the bureau and pursuing his interest in the paranormal on his own.

While performing the autopsy on the body recovered from the New Jersey sewer, Scully discovers a strange, worm-like creature slithering inside the corpse. Meanwhile, another sanitation worker is attacked by the creature lurking inside the sewer. This time, the victim survives. Mulder and a hospital physician, Dr. Zenzola, inspect a wound on the workman's back. Unsure about what could have made the mark, Mulder and the doctor tell the man he can leave the hospital. But when the workman returns home, a parasitic worm forces its way out of his body, killing him in the process.

Mulder pays a visit to the sewage processing plant. An elderly employee named Charlie discovers a humanoid creature swimming in a sedimentation pond. Terrified, he flushes the system, capturing the creature in the process. Mulder has it placed in a holding cell.

With the creature in custody, Mulder pays a visit to Skinner. He states that had the case been treated as an X-File from the beginning, the workman's life might have been spared. Skinner tells Mulder that the creature will be institutionalized... and he agrees that the case should have been labeled an X-File.

The creature escapes and takes refuge inside a chemical tank near a campsite. It is accidentally sucked inside a tanker truck and transported away. Meanwhile, Mulder receives mysterious messages from a high-ranking government official who makes it clear that reinstatement of the X-Files depends on his success with the assignment.

Mulder tracks the creature to a sewage treatment plant. Scully warns him that the fluke she discovered inside the corpse is actually an incubating larva-meaning that the creature is trying to reproduce. The agent and a foreman crawl inside a tunnel hoping to locate the creature. It suddenly lunges out of the water and grabs hold of the foreman, dragging him beneath the foul sludge. The foreman resurfaces, gasping for air. The creature makes its way to an overflow pipe, which leads to the sea. Mulder engages a rusty lever, causing a guillotine-like metal gate to drop from above. The creature is severed in two.

Later, Mulder meets with Scully, who produces photographs linking the creature to meltdown waste from the Chernobyl Reactor in Russia.

Ed Funsch is an ordinary guy who performs an ordinary job at the United States Post Office in Franklyn, Pennsylvania. One day his supervisor delivers bad news: because of cutbacks, Ed has been laid off. Depressed about his prospects for the future, Ed nonetheless returns to his spot at the zip code sorter machine. As he stares at the digital display on the device, numbers begin changing into letters of the alphabet. They form words. Instead of seeing postal codes, Ed views a message: "Kill 'Em All."

Shortly thereafter, a real estate agent enters a crowded elevator in an office building. He begins sweating profusely, and as he stares at the elevator's digital display floor-indicator, he too sees the message "Kill 'Em All." The man loses control. He strikes out at the other passengers, killing two in a wild frenzy.

The senselessness of the crime, and its similarity to other violent incidents that have rocked the small town of Franklyn, prompts local police ask for the FBI's help. Mulder is assigned the case. He learns that the real estate agent and others who suddenly went berserk did so in a busy, public area. None of the suspects obeyed orders to surrender and were subsequently shot to death by police. Mulder suspects that electronic devices found smashed at the scenes of the crimes are linked to the killings.

Another bizarre killing shakes the small town when a woman attacks a lecherous automotive mechanic at the garage where he works. Mulder inspects the murder scene and is most intrigued by a smashed digital dashboard display. Accompanied by local police, Mulder interviews Bonnie McRoberts, whose car the mechanic was working on at the time he was murdered. But McRoberts suddenly goes berserk and slashes at Mulder with a knife. Police open fire, killing her. Scully examines the woman's corpse and finds evidence that a chemical similar to LSD is present in her blood. But that chemical is only triggered when a high amount of adrenaline is secreted.

Mulder discovers that the city of Franklyn sprays orchards with dangerous insecticides in its quest to exterminate a particularly virulent species of cluster fly. Unfortunately, he learns this firsthand-he is doused by a helicopter flying a secret operation under the cover of darkness. County Supervisor Larry Winter defends the operation, noting that the local economy depends on crops.

But Mulder's exposure to the chemical begins to have an effect on his mind. He too sees messages in electronic displays. He realizes that all of the killers suffered from phobias-phobias that could be exploited through subliminal means. Since the chemical agent used in the manufacture of the insecticide produces fear in cluster flies, Mulder concludes the same fear is being chemically induced and then triggered by someone using the town of Franklyn for a controlled experiment.

In New York City, Dr. Saul Grissom, a pioneer in sleep disorders, calls 911 to report a fire outside his apartment. When emergency crews arrive at Grissom's building, they do not find a fire. But they do find Grissom's dead body. Skinner assigns Mulder and Alex Krycek, another agent for the FBI, to investigate the mysterious incident. Annoyed at the prospect of working with Krycek, Mulder travels to Connecticut by himself. He interviews Dr. Penelope Charyn, who explains that Grissom revolutionized sleep therapy, and developed a process whereby a person's dreams can be altered by electric stimulation.

Mulder grudgingly accepts Krycek as his partner. They visit Scully in the autopsy bay. She explains that Grissom shows classic physiological responses of having been burned alive in a fire... yet his flesh is not charred. Interest in the case grows when another man, Henry Willig, is found dead in his apartment with forty-three internal hemorrhages-signs that he had been shot to death. But upon examination, no bullets or signs of foul play are detected. Mulder realizes that both Willig and Grissom were Vietnam veterans, and that both were stationed at Parris Island. After further checking, the agents determine that Augustus Cole is the only surviving member of a special squad that included Willig. But Cole turns up missing when he is traced to a psychiatric ward.

A mysterious government operative, X, meets Mulder in a dark parking structure (as did Deep Throat). He claims that Grissom conducted sleep deprivation experiments as Parris Island in an attempt to make soldiers aggressive and fearless. The woman warns that Augustus Cole has not slept in twenty-four years. The agents get a break in the case when Cole robs a pharmacy of anti-depressants. Mulder and Krycek are shocked when two officers shoot one another while searching the drug store. Mulder theorizes that Cole possesses the ability to project his consciousness into the minds of other people.

The agents locate Salvatore Matola, a former member of the special marine squad whose name was not officially listed on any government documents. Matola claims that a Dr. Girardi participated in the experiments. He also admits that his entire squad went AWOL and massacred everyone who lived in the Vietnamese village of Phu Bai. Mulder concludes that Cole is punishing everyone associated with the massacre for its twenty-fourth anniversary. The agents rush to a train station to intercept Girardi. Mulder draws his gun when he sees Cole, pistol in hand, approaching Girardi. But in reality, Mulder is reacting to images projected into his mind. Seeing that Mulder is pointing his gun at innocent bystanders, Krycek shoots at Mulder. Luckily, he misses.

The agents track Cole and Girardi to a train car in a railway yard. Girardi is badly injured, the victim of Cole's dream projection. Mulder finds Cole and tries convincing him to testify in court about the experiment. But Cole projects an image into Krycek's brain, making it seem as if he is pointing a gun at Mulder. Krycek falls for the trick and shoots Cole. Later, Krycek reports to a mysterious tribunal that is bent on eliminating Mulder and Scully forever.

Mulder and Alex Krycek are assigned to a hostage negotiation. They are briefed by Agent Lucy Kazdin, who explains that a mental patient named Duane Barry has taken his psychologist, Dr. Hakkie, and three other people hostage at a travel agency. Barry demands safe passage for himself and Hakkie to an alien abduction site-although he cannot remember where the site is. Mulder phones Barry and tries calming him. It soon becomes apparent that Barry is well acquainted with hostage crises. Kazdin explains that Barry is a former FBI agent.

A strange light envelopes the scene. Barry becomes unglued and fires his gun, wounding some of the hostages. Kazdin explains that a power generator blew, but Mulder suspects otherwise. Mulder and Agent Janus volunteer to aid the wounded. They are equipped with a flak jacket and a wire. As Janus tends to an injured man, Mulder speaks with Barry in person for the first time. He strays from the FBI script and talks about UFOs candidly. Barry is taken aback; it's the first time someone given credence to his past experiences. He allows Mulder to trade himself for one of the hostages. As Mulder walks Barry through his UFO encounters, the FBI agents listen in, convinced that Barry is being driven over the edge.

When Scully is updated of the situation, she urges the FBI to get Mulder out immediately. She explains that in 1982, Barry was shot in the line of duty. The injury effectively destroyed the moral center of his brain, leaving him a pathological liar who suffers from severe delusions. Scully speaks to Mulder via the hidden two-way receiver wired to his body. She urges him to get the hostages away from Barry. Barry concedes to Mulder's request and releases the remaining hostages. Soon after, an FBI marksman shoots Barry.

Barry is rushed to a hospital. Kazdin tells Mulder that x-rays revealed strange pieces of metal inside Barry's nasal cavity, lending credence to the man's claim that he was kidnapped and tortured by aliens. Scully discovers that the metal is encoded with strange symbols.

Barry escapes from his hospital room. Without warning, he bursts into Scully's apartment and attacks her.

Mulder rushes to Scully's apartment when he realizes that she was attacked by Duane Barry. When he arrives at the scene, a police investigation is already in progress. There are signs of a struggle; broken glass and human blood dot the floor. Scully's mother Margaret speaks to Mulder about the abduction; she describes a nightmare she experienced that foretold the incident. FBI agents are skeptical when Mulder hints that Barry's UFO story might be legitimate. Skinner removes Mulder from the investigation and sends him home.

Meanwhile, Barry makes his way to the alien landing site. A patrolman pulls Barry over for speeding. He notices blood on Barry's hands and draws his weapon. But Barry pulls a gun and kills the police officer. Mulder reviews a videotape of the incident which was recorded by a camera mounted inside the patrolman's car. Using video enhancement, Scully's image is pinpointed-and she is alive.

Mulder reviews audio tapes of his hostage negotiations. He realizes that Barry is heading for Skyland Mountain in Virginia. Accompanied by Krycek, Mulder drives to the remote location. They are told by a tram operator that Barry is driving up the mountain using back roads. Hoping to beat Barry to the summit, Mulder boards the dangerous passenger tram and journeys up the mountain. But before the tram reaches its destination, Krycek kills the tram operator and sabotages the controls, stranding Mulder in the process. When Mulder attempts to climb off the tram, Krycek engages the power, hoping to crush him. But Mulder outmaneuvers Krycek and continues his search.

Mulder sees a blinding light pass overhead. When he locates Barry, Scully is nowhere to be found. Barry begins laughing hysterically. He describes how the aliens will no longer bother him now that they have another guinea pig. But Mulder remains skeptical; he questions Barry's sanity and lashes out at him during an interrogation. Shortly after Krycek conducts his own interrogation, Barry lapses into cardiac arrest and dies.

Mulder tells Skinner that Krycek poisoned Barry-and that the military is aware of Scully's location. He believes that Scully got too close to the truth, especially when she discovered the metallic implant. Mulder concludes that a covert military operation-assisted by the mysterious Smoking Man-is behind the cover-up. Those suspicions are confirmed when Krycek vanishes without a trace. Left with little choice, Skinner officially reopens the X-Files.

With Scully still missing, Mulder begins work on the newly reopened X-Files project. He investigates the violent death of a Los Angeles businessman who was attacked by several people as he used his jacuzzi. The murder resembles several other similar attacks believed to have been committed by the Trinity Killers: the victim's body is drained of blood, bite marks are discovered on the exterior jugular vein, and a quotation written in blood is found near the body.

Mulder tracks his first suspect to the Hollywood Blood Bank. He finds a new employee in the basement dining on human blood. The man, who calls himself The Son, wants to live forever because he believes there is no afterlife. Mulder believes the man is delusional and a faker. Believing his condition a psychological, Mulder places The Son in a jail cell where he will come in contact with direct sunlight at dawn. Mulder tells him the sunlight will be blocked if he reveals the whereabouts of his accomplices. But as guards watch, horrified, The Son burns to death when dawn breaks.

Mulder theorizes that vampirism is, in part, based on a real disease called porphyria, an affliction which causes blisters on the skin when a sufferer is exposed to sunlight. With the aid of a coroner, a hand stamp on The Son's skin is deciphered. It reads "Club Tepes." Mulder visits the club, where he meets a mysterious woman named Kristen. During an erotic encounter, Kristen tempts him with a drop of her blood. But Mulder declines to drink. An Asian man accepts Kristen's offer and the couple retreat to a secluded area. When Kristen finishes arousing the man, three of her accomplices rush him.

Mulder and members of the police department discover the man's corpse drained of blood. Nearby is a can of cranberry sauce and some fingerprints. By matching the fingerprint with existing records, Mulder locates Kristen's home. Kristen recounts how she first met The Son, whose real name was John. During a fight with John, they tasted each other's blood. From that point on they turned to "blood sports." They were joined by others, but Kristen explains how it turned unnatural. Kristen insists that with John dead, she is not in jeopardy. She refuses Mulder's escort to the police department. Instead, Mulder spends the night with Kristen, and the two become lovers.

The next day, The Son appears at Kristen's house as wild fires spread throughout the Malibu hills. The Son tells Kristen that he is immortal and cannot be killed even by sunlight. He instructs Kristen to kill Mulder. Instead, Kristen stabs The Father, the first of the Holy Trinity, who is hiding in the darkness. The Son attacks Mulder, but he is overpowered and tied up. As the fires near the house, Mulder and Kristen attempt to make their getaway by car. Suddenly, The Holy Spirit attacks the couple. Kristen hits the vampire with her car, impaling it against a nail. She returns to the house and pours gasoline around herself and The Son. She states her intent to become immortal and ignites the gas. Later, firemen tell Mulder that four corpses were discovered inside the house.

@{fg shine}One Breath [#31]@{fg text}

Despite Mulder's objection that it is still too soon to give up hope, Margaret Scully orders a gravestone for her missing daughter, Dana. Not long afterward, Dana's comatose body mysteriously appears at a local hospital. She is hooked to a life support system, her condition critical. There are no records indicating how she arrived at the hospital... or who brought her there. Mulder is furious. A doctor reveals that Dana's living will specifically requests termination of life support should such a situation develop.

Melissa Scully visits the hospital. She claims that, through channeling, she can communicate with her sister. Dana also receives a visit from Frohike, one of the Lone Gunman. Frohike and his colleagues discover that Dana's DNA exhibits signs of genetic tampering. They conclude that with her immune system decimated, Dana does not have long to live.

When Mulder returns to the hospital, he sees a mysterious man steal a vial containing Dana's blood sample. Mulder gives chase. A fight ensues between the two men. Suddenly, X emerges from the shadows and shoots the mysterious man. Mulder is shocked at the senselessness of the killing. He does, however, recover the blood sample. Soon after, the Scullys honor Dana's wish and the life support system is disconnected.

Mulder approaches Skinner and demands he have access to the mysterious Cigarette-Smoking Man, convinced he is responsible for the cover-up. But his request is denied. Some time later, at the hospital, a mysterious woman leaves behind a pack of cigarettes containing the Smoking Man's address. Mulder secretly enters the Smoking Man's apartment and puts a gun to his head. But the Smoking Man holds all the cards; he reminds Mulder that if he dies, he takes all the secrets with him. Realizing he has arrived at a dead end, Mulder gives Skinner his resignation.

Skinner refuses to accept Mulder's resignation. Later, Mulder is approached by X and leaked information regarding an illegal search that will occur at his apartment, a search that will be performed by government operatives. Mulder is instructed to kill the intruders and claim self-defense. As Mulder waits in the darkness for the agents, Melissa appears at his door. She tells him that Dana's condition is deteriorating, and that now more than ever, Dana needs him at her side. Mulder visits Scully's bedside and gives her words of encouragement. When Mulder returns to his apartment, he finds that it has been ransacked.

The next day, Mulder receives a telephone call from the hospital. Dana has regained consciousness.

@{fg shine}Firewalker [#32]@{fg text}

Adam Pierce, a technician at the California Institute of Technology's Volcano Observatory, approaches Mulder and Scully with a mystery. A team of scientists working at Mount Avalon issued a distress signal requesting an immediate airlift. When contact with the team was lost, Pierce and his fellow scientists at Cal Tech activated a robotic camera, nicknamed Firewalker, which relayed pictures from inside an active volcano. The pictures--which are reviewed by Mulder and Scully --show Chief Seismologist Phil Erikson's heat-seared corpse lying at the volcano's caldera, where temperatures reach over 400 degrees Celsius. The videotape also captured a hulking figure near the body. Pierce suspects that his brilliant colleague, Daniel Trepkos, may somehow be responsible for the death.

Mulder, Scully and Pierce fly by helicopter to Mount Avalon. They find scientists Jason Ludwig, Jesse O'Neil and Peter Tanaka hiding inside the field base. Ludwig describes how Trepkos went berserk and destroyed the facilities. Shortly thereafter, Trepkos finds Pierce and strangles him. Mulder uncovers Trepkos' notes, which describe an unknown life form living inside the volcano. The notes suggest Trepkos possesses physical evidence that proves the existence of silicon-based life. Scully interviews Jesse O'Neil, who had been romantically linked to Trepkos.

Tanaka begins having coughing fits. Scully insists he be airlifted off the base and taken to a hospital. But the scientist runs off into the forest. Mulder and Ludwig give chase. Tanaka loses his balance and trips, falling down an embankment. Suddenly, his throat swells enormously and a spike pierces his skin, killing him instantly. Scully's examination of the body supports Mulder's theory that a silicon-based life form, possibly a fungus, grew inside Tanaka's body. Believing the fungus to be communicable and airborne, the group is quarantined.

Ludwig volunteers to guide Mulder to the underground steam caves where Trepkos is believed to be hiding. But Trepkos surprises them and shoots Ludwig with a flare gun. He proceeds to burn the body so that the parasitic spore living inside will die. Trepkos explains the Erikson inadvertently released the spore after Firewalker pulled a sample out of the volcano. Everyone at the base--except himself--was infected by the parasite. Hecrippled the transmitter equipment, and killed Pierce, all in an effort to keep the spore from spreading. Mulder, realizing Scully is in jeopardy, races back to the base.

O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully and loses consciousness. Realizing what is about to occur, Scully carries her body to rubber-sealed Plexiglas door and placed her on the other side, separating them. O'Neil's throat expands to grotesque proportions--the fungus within replicating--ready to infect a new host. Suddenly, O'Neil's throat explodes, the organic matter spattering against the Plexiglas. Mulder finds Scully safe and unharmed.

Trepkos returns to the base, where he discovers Jesse's corpse. Mulder allows him to remove the body and leave the area. Meanwhile, he and Scully are quarantined for a month to ensure neither has been infected.

@{fg shine}Red Museum [#33]@{fg text}

Gary Kane, a sixteen-year-old high school student, leaves his home suddenly after receiving a mysterious phone call. When Gary fails to return home, his mother, Beth, notifies police. Two officers on patrol notice Gary-who is clad only in his underwear-wandering aimlessly in a wooded area. A phrase is written on his back in marker: "He is one."

Mulder and Scully review the facts in the case. Gary was not sexually assaulted, nor was he the victim of a prank. Surprisingly, there are reports of other teenagers having experienced similar ordeals. Mulder's curiosity is piqued when a Wisconsin sheriff, Bill Mazeroski, speculates that the victims have been possessed. He explains that a religious cult called the Church of the Red Museum settled into the area and purchased a cattle ranch. Being vegetarians, the church members turned beef cattle into pets-much to the consternation of local ranchers. The sheriff takes the agents to the church. They watch as Richard Odin, the sect's leader, addresses his parishioners via a computer. Mulder explains to Scully that the church members are "walk ins"-believers in soul transference who have taken possession of other people's bodies.

Local teenagers harass a young Red Museum member. Mulder comes to the boy's aid, and in the process learns that one of the harassers is the sheriff's son, Rick. A girl who participated in the verbal attack on the Red Museum member is later found with the message "She is one" scrawled on her back. Lab tests reveal large quantities of a hallucinogen-a controlled substance-in the girl's blood. That night, a small plane carrying Dr. Gerry Larson crash lands in a field. Mulder, Scully and Sheriff Mazeroski discover a briefcase bearing Larson's initials filled with hundred dollar bills. They also discover a vial containing a mysterious fluid, and a computer printout list containing the names and credit card numbers of the victims' families... each of whom Larson delivered and treated through childhood.

While interviewing Beth Kane, Mulder notices a light shining through a hole in her bathroom mirror. He smashes the glass, revealing a video camera surveillance set-up. The man behind the surveillance, Gerd Thomas, abducts Rick, the sheriff's son... just as he abducted all the previous victims. But instead of turning up dazed, Rick is found dead. Mulder discovers that Gerd Thomas owns the building where the Kane family lives. He is placed under arrest. Numerous video tapes are recovered. Thomas apologizes for his sickness but insists he did not murder Rick. He explains that Dr. Larson was paying him to inject cattle with a mysterious liquid... the same liquid Larson used to "inoculate" his young patients.

Scully sees the mysterious Crew-Cut Man--who executed Deep Throat--driving on the street. Mulder realizes that the mysterious fluid is alien DNA, the same substance found in the erlenmeyer flask months earlier. The Crew-cut Man, Scully speculates, killed Rick to cover up evidence. Aware that other lives are in danger, Mulder asks the sheriff to round up everyone on Larson's computer list and transport them to the Red Museum. Realizing that the Crew-cut Man's base of operation is the local slaughterhouse, Mulder rushes to the scene. He finds the facility soaked with gasoline. The Crew-cut Man suddenly springs from the darkness and a fight ensues. Scully and Mazeroski arrive and shoot the Crew-cut Man, killing him. An investigation reveals no clues as to who the man was or the chemical makeup of the substance injected into the townspeople.

@{fg shine}Excelsius Dei [#34]@{fg text}

Michelle Charter works as a nurse at the Excelsis Dei Convalescent Home. While making her rounds one night, she is suddenly and violently attacked by an invisible entity that proceeds to rape her. News of the attack reaches FBI headquarters, piquing Mulder and Scully's interest in the case. They travel to Worcester, Massachusetts, the town where Michelle works. During her interview, Michelle insists that the spirit which entered her body emanated from an elderly patient afflicted with Alzheimer's disease named Hal Arden. Outraged by the incident, she initiates a lawsuit against the federal government claiming that she is regularly subjected to sexual harassment and has no recourse for protection.

The agents speak with Hal, who assures them he is not strong enough, nor possesses the sexual drive, to rape anyone. But shortly thereafter Hal begins choking after he secretly ingests a mysterious pill given him by his roommate Stan. Mulder and Scully are unable to save Hal and he dies. Dr. John Grago is upset when he learns the news; Hal's Alzheimer's disease had been in remission since he began taking an experimental drug called Depranil. Laura Kelly, the daughter of Hal's roommate, Stan, has her father discharged from the facility because of his markedly improved mental and physical state. She notes, however, that Stan has begged her not to take him away from the home.

The mystery deepens when Tiernan, a hospital orderly, is pushed out a window by an invisible force. A toxicological report on Hal's blood reveals trace levels of Ibotenic acid, an hallucinogenic drug. While searching the basement of the nursing home, Mulder uncovers a room containing hundreds of mushrooms. And beneath a pile of fertilizer Mulder discovers the dead body of a missing orderly. Gung, an Asian orderly, is questioned about the room. He admits that he has been feeding herbs to the residents-herbs that allow them to speak to the dead. Gung is convinced that the mysterious rapes and murders were committed by angry spirits. Stan overdoses on the herbs and a group of ghosts mass for an attack against residents and visitors alike. Michelle and Mulder become trapped inside a bathroom that floods with water. Scully comes to their aid. Grego finds Stan and drugs him. Suddenly, the attacks end and the ghosts disappear. The door to the bathroom suddenly bursts open, sending Mulder and Michelle sliding to the floor in a great rush of water.

@{fg shine}Aubrey [#35]@{fg text}

In the town of Aubrey, Missouri, Detective B.J. Morrow experiences a frightening vision. In her mind's eye, she sees a man bury a corpse in a shallow grave. Certain of the exact location, B.J. rushes to a field, shovel in hand, and exhumes the body.

Using dental records, Mulder and Scully positively identify the remains. The victim is FBI Agent Sam Chaney, who disappeared in the 1940s along with his partner, Tim Ledbetter. Chaney and Ledbetter were investigating a serial murder case at the time. Mulder is puzzled by B.J. and her sudden knowledge of where the body was buried, so he and Scully travel to Aubrey hoping to uncover more about the case.

During questioning, B.J. tells the agents her car stalled near the field one night, and she noticed a dog digging in the ground. She claims it attracted her attention and, after some digging, she proceeded to find the grave. But Scully senses that B.J. is having an affair with Lieutenant Brian Tillman. She theorizes that B.J. made the initial phone call alerting police about the body from the motel where she was rendezvousing with Tillman. When confronted about the truth, B.J. admits she not only is having an affair with the married Tillman-she is pregnant. She also reveals how the pregnancy has triggered strange dreams in which she sees another murder.

Further research reveals that the serial murderer, dubbed the "Slash Killer" by the press at the time, would knock female victims unconscious and carve the word "sister" on their chests. Mulder suspects that Chaney was a victim of the killer he was trying to catch. Using a computer, the agents analyze the victim's bone fragments hoping to find more clues. Preliminary findings suggest that letters where carved into the corpse. Those letters, B.J. reveals, spelled the word "brother."

The agents are intrigued when Tillman reveals that the same serial killer who stalked Aubrey fifty years earlier has apparently embarked on another murderous rampage. Accompanied by B.J., Mulder and Scully search the scene of the latest crime. B.J. realizes the victim is the woman she saw in her dream.

B.J. searches through mug shots from the 1940s and identifies the man in her dreams. He is Harry Cokely, convicted in 1945 for rape and attempted murder. He carved the word "sister" on his victim, Linda Thibedeaux, before she escaped. The agents visit Cokely, now in his seventies, sickly and house ridden.

B.J. awakens one night with blood seeping from her chest. She experiences another vision and rushes to a stranger's home, where she uncovers the body of Ledbetter.

The agents interview Linda Thibodeaux. She admits that, as a result of being raped, she gave birth to Cokely's child. She placed the baby in the hands to an adoption agency. Further investigation reveals that Cokely's son was Raymond Morrow-B.J.'s father. The agents conclude that B.J. committed the latest series of killings.

B.J. attacks Thibodeaux, but she stops short of killing her. Mulder and Scully rush to Cokely's house, suspecting that B.J. will attempt revenge. Cokely dies after his oxygen equipment is sabotaged. B.J. attacks Mulder with a razor. But Tillman arrives and reminds B.J. who she really is. B.J. falls into a trance and is taken into custody.

Donnie Pfaster lost his job at a funeral home after his boss discovered him cutting hair from the corpse of a pretty girl. Not long after Donnie's dismissal, Special FBI Agent Moe Bocks receives a call regarding the mutilation of buried corpses at a graveyard in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Suspecting the incident might be related to UFOs, Bocks notifies Mulder and Scully, hoping their expertise might help shed some light on the bizarre incident. But Mulder recognizes signs of an escalating fetishist-a man who collects dead things-at work. Despite her years of work performing autopsies, Scully is nonetheless repulsed by the manner in which the bodies are mutilated. Hair has been snipped away in clumps, and fingernails have been torn out with pliers. Scully is plagued by nightmares featuring a demon. In the dreams, she becomes one of the killer's victims.

When even more mutilated bodies turn up, Mulder fears the fetishist's compulsion might lead to murder. His suspicions prove correct: Donnie employs the services of a prostitute, then murders and mutilates her. After examining how the body was defiled, Mulder suspects the killer has a deep hatred toward women.

Donnie make a conscious effort to blend into the community. He takes a job as a delivery man, and while working his route he wins the confidence of Ellen Brumfield and her family. He enrolls in a mythology class at a junior college, but his attention is drawn to a pretty coed who sits at the front of the class. One night in the school's parking lot Donnie pins the girl to her car. But she strikes back by kneeing him in the groin. Donnie is arrested. That same night, however, a different suspect with a history of assault is also arrested. Mulder and Scully interview the man at the jail but determine he is not a suspect. But Donnie, who is in a cell nearby, takes note of Scully's name.

Bothered by her reaction to the case, Scully flies back to Washington and seeks the services of Karen Kosseff, a member of the FBI's Employee Assistance Program. Scully admits she has lost faith and feels vulnerable. Meanwhile, forensics lifts a fingerprint off the prostitute's corpse. Mulder and Bocks trace the print to Donnie, leading them to his apartment. They search the dwelling and discover a human finger inside a freezer.

Donnie begins stalking Scully after she flies back to Minneapolis. He forces her rental car off the road and kidnaps her. Police locate the car. Mulder and Bocks search for clues but come up empty-handed. Mulder realizes that Donnie's psychological profile sketches the mind of a deviant who, like notorious murders before him, is the embodiment of evil.

Scully breaks free from her bonds and attempts to elude her captor. But Donnie gives chase, gun in hand. The two grapple for the weapon, and as Scully looks at Donnie's face, she sees the visage of a demon, the same horrible creature from her dream. Mulder and Bocks storm Donnie's hideout. Donnie drops his weapon and is taken into custody.

@{fg shine}Die Hand Die Verletzt [#37]@{fg text}

In a remote wooded area of New Hampshire, a group of teenagers-two boys and two girls-locate an alter that they believe is used for Black Magic. One of the kids, a boy named Dave Duran, jokingly recites an incantation believing it will scare his girlfriend. But the joke backfires and the words summon a powerful, evil force. The kids panic and run away from the alter. One of the teenagers, Jerry Stevens, is attacked by the force. A hunter discovers his desecrated body the following morning.

Believing the murder to be the work of a witch cult, Sheriff John Oakes asks the F.B.I. for help. Mulder and Scully examine the corpse-its eyes and heart having been cut out. Mulder's sense that the area has a strange feel is confirmed when toads begin dropping from the sky. Scully attributes the strange event to tornados in Northern Massachusetts. After researching a local library, the agents discover that Duran checked out a book on witchcraft. When questioned, a horrified Duran admits he never thought his words would summon the Devil.

A visit to Crowley High School uncovers signs that the student population suffers from repressed memory. Scully, however, attributes the town's fear to mass hysteria. But Mulder notes how water in the city drains in a counter clockwise fashion-against the laws of gravity. He believes a powerful force is at work.

During a science class, a fifteen-year-old girl named Shannon Ausbury suddenly begins screaming when asked to dissect a pig embryo. The agents question the girl. Shannon recounts how her stepfather sexually molested her, a nearly forgotten memory. But she also recounts how her parents friends impregnated her three times and then killed the children. She also claims that Jim murdered her sister during a sacrifice. Mulder and Scully are stunned by the claims and decide to interview her parents.

The Ausburys claim one daughter died of crib death and assure the agents their daughter has never been pregnant. With the town's secret in danger of being exposed, a devil worshiper named Mrs. Paddock, a new teacher at the high school, places a spell on Shannon. Shortly thereafter, Shannon slashes her wrists.

A group of parents-who are member of the high school's PTC-meet in secret. But these are no ordinary townsfolk; the parents worship Black Magic. The PTC members tell Jim Ausbury that they were responsible for Shannon's death. Anxious for the police and FBI investigations to end, and realizing that Shannon makes the perfect scapegoat, they fabricate a story in which Shannon killed Jerry out of jealousy. But Jim Ausbury, disillusioned with his religion and disgusted with the PTC members and their lie about his daughter, tells Mulder the truth: Shannon and other youngsters were forced to participate in the ancient rituals against their will. Using post hypnotic suggestion, the memory of the rituals was repressed. After exposing the conspiracy, Ausbury is attacked and swallowed by a large python.

Recalling that Mrs. Paddock kept a snake in her room, the agents decide an investigation is in order. But when they arrive at the school, PTC members take them hostage. Before the occultists can do the agents harm, they suddenly and mysteriously attack and kill one another. Mulder and Scully escape and search for Mrs. Paddock. But she is not to be found.

@{fg shine}Fresh Bones [#38]@{fg text}

In North Carolina, Mulder and Scully investigate when two Marines stationed at the Folkstone government processing center for Haitian refugees die in mysterious accidents. The Marines officially classify the deaths as suicides, but Robin McAlpin, the wife of one victim, believes otherwise. Private Jack McAlpin died after he lost control of his car and skidded into a tree. The agents comb the accident scene and discover a strange image painted on the tree. Mrs. McAlpin tells the agents that a Marine named Harry Dunham suspects that the murders were caused by a voodoo curse.

Mulder and Scully visit the encampment hoping to find answers. As they survey the deplorable conditions, a young Haitian boy, Chester, sells the agents a charm to help ward off evil. Later, the agents speak with Colonel Jacob Wharton, who runs the camp. He confirms that ever since a young Haitian boy was killed in the camp, things have been chaotic. Wharton blames the trouble on Pierre Bauvais, a revolutionary held in an isolation cell. Bauvais cryptically blames the deaths on loco-miroir, the voodoo crossroads between two worlds.

Scully obtains permission to examine McAlpin's corpse. In the temporary camp morgue, Scully and a marine physician are horrified when they discover the body of a dead dog in place of McAlpin. Later that night, as Scully drives Mulder through the rain, a bedraggled man hobbles in front of the car. Scully slams on the brakes. The agents are shocked when they get a good look at the man-Jack McAlpin.

A blood test reveals trace levels of a poison called tetrodotoxin in McAlpin's system. Mulder speculates that someone injected the Marine with the poison, thereby making him appear dead. This leads the agents to the grave of Manuel Guttierez, the second Marine who allegedly committed suicide. The body, however, is missing. A gravekeeper explains how grave robbers regularly snatch the dead from their resting grounds. Mulder spots Chester in the cemetery. The boy explains that he collects and sells frogs that Bauvais uses for his magic. This piques Scully's interest, as certain frog species secrete a substance chemically similar to the toxin found in McAlpin's blood.

Mulder questions Dunham. He insists that Bauvais threatened to take the souls of all the Marines, one by one, unless his people are released. Mulder confronts Wharton with allegations of prisoner mistreatment, but the Colonel insists there is no official policy of harassment. Wharton is convinced that Bauvais told the agents about his illegal mistreatment of the Haitians. In response, he has Bauvais severely beaten.

The agents discover Dunham's corpse floating in a bathtub, blood oozing from a stab wound. They also discover McAlpin nearby holding a knife. Suspecting Bauvais is somehow responsible, the agents ask Wharton for permission to speak with him. Wharton, however, claims that Bauvais killed himself by slashing his wrists with a bedspring. The case turns more bizarre when Robin McAlpin gives the agents a photo that Dunham wanted released in the event of his death. The picture reveals Wharton engaged in a voodoo ceremony with Bauvais.

Mulder and Scully rush to the cemetery after learning that Wharton intends to steal Bauvais' soul. As Mulder falls victim to Wharton's magic, Bauvais rises from the dead. He avenges his murder by killing Wharton. Scully, meanwhile, fends off an attack by using the special charm that Chester sold Mulder.

Agent Mulder, unconscious and suffering from severe hypothermia, is transported by helicopter to a base in Alaska. Scully rushes to her partner's aid, and immediately clashes with doctors at the scene. When Mulder's heart stops, she insists he be removed from a tub of warm water because the cold is the only thing keeping him alive. With the doctors locked in a stalemate, the sequence of events leading to Mulder's condition unfolds...

A research vessel sailing in the Arctic Circle encounters what appears to be a UFO crashing into the Beaufort Sea. But the news media reports that the spacecraft was, in actuality, a Russian plane. The pilot of that craft, a bounty hunter, disappears, and later begins killing doctors at abortion clinics across the United States, setting fires to cover the crime. Mulder discovers that the doctors, though unrelated by birth, look identical. The mystery deepens when it is discovered that officials never recovered bodies from the burned clinics.

The agents uncover evidence that the killer ran ads in local newspapers in an effort to locate his targets. They realize his next intended victim is a doctor in Syracuse. Mulder notifies Agent Weiss to guard the doctor until they arrived at the scene. But Weiss discovers the bounty hunter standing over the doctor's corpse (which Is slowly dissolving-as if dipped in acid). Weiss opens fire on the bounty hunter, but his bullets prove ineffective. When Mulder and Scully arrive in Syracuse, Weiss tells them there was no sign of the doctor. Unknown to the agents, the bounty hunter is capable of morphing into different shapes, allowing him to assume Weiss' identity. When Mulder return to Washington to meet with Skinner, he learns that Weiss has been killed.

A CIA agent named Ambrose Chapel approaches Mulder and Scully. He claims that during the Cold war Soviet scientists discovered how to clone DNA. They planted clones in strategic positions within America's medical establishment, hoping to sabotage the country's immune system in the event of war. Chapel believes a secret agreement exists that sent the bounty hunter to eliminate the clones in exchange for absolute suppression of the program's existence. The clones, Chapel suspects, were attempting to contact the agents, hoping they would expose the plot.

Mulder flies home when he receives word there was a family emergency-losing contact with Scully in the process. When he arrives, he is shocked to discover his sister Samantha-who had been abducted by a UFO as a child-in the company of his parents.

Samantha tells Mulder that after her abduction she was placed in the care of visitors from another planet, and then made to forget her real family. She used hypnotic therapy to uncover her buried memories and locate her family. She asks Mulder to help stop the bounty hunter before he kills her adoptive father.

Scully discovers more of the clones hiding in an industrial building. She has them placed in maximum protective custody. Mulder finally locates Scully and enters her hotel room. But Scully realizes the man standing in her room is not the real Mulder...

Deep beneath the frigid waters of the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Circle, crewmen aboard a submarine investigate sonar readings that indicate a huge, unidentified craft is floating nearby. The submarine's captain receives orders to destroy the vessel without further investigation. Before torpedoes are launched, however, a powerful shock wave disables the submarine's reactors.

Meanwhile, a bewildered Scully receives a telephone call from Mulder as, simultaneously, a man who appears to be Mulder (the alien bounty hunter from the previous episode) shows up at her motel room. The doppelganger overpowers Scully, and demands to know where he can find Mulder. When Scully refuses to cooperate, the doppelganger throws her across the room.

The real Mulder and his sister, Samantha, arrive at the motel some time later. Scully is gone, but signs of a struggle are evident. Samantha tells Mulder that the bounty hunter is interested in her, not Scully. Samantha explains that the only way the bounty hunter can be killed is to pierce the base of his skull. She warns, however, that his blood is toxic, and exposure to humans is fatal.

Samantha assures her brother that the bounty hunter will contact them. As they await word, Samantha explains that aliens have been attempting to establish a colony on Earth since the late 1940s. But their experiments with cloning was not sanctioned, and others of their race considered it a dilution of the species. A bounty hunter was dispatched to terminate the colony.

Scully, held at gun point, telephones Mulder and arranges a rendezvous at a bridge. Mulder informs Skinner of the situation, and an FBI sharpshooter is positioned nearby. The exchange is made, and the bounty hunter walks Samantha toward an awaiting van. Suddenly, the sharpshooter's bullet rings out. The bounty hunter is struck in the neck. He falls backwards over the bridge, still clinging to Samantha. The pair plummet into the dark, icy waters below.

Mulder relays news of his sister's apparent death to his father. Mr. Mulder gives his son an envelope, which Samantha had left behind during her visit. Mulder opens it and finds a key and address inside. Mulder travels to the address, which turns out to be an abortion clinic. Inside, Mulder is shocked to discover alien clones who look like his sister. Suddenly, the bounty hunter appears and knocks Mulder unconscious. A fire races through the building, but Mulder is saved by firefighters.

X tells Mulder that all the clones, save the original "Samantha," was killed in the fire. He also admits that the bounty hunter is inside a vessel beneath the Beaufort Sea. Meanwhile, pathologists tell Scully that a strange retrovirus found in Agent Weiss's blood is inhibited by extreme cold. This leads Scully to conclude that the bounty hunter may have survived his fall into the icy river.

Mulder makes the trip to Alaska by himself in secret. He finds the submarine's conning tower protruding from the ice. Inside, he encounters the bounty hunter. During a stuggle, the bounty hunter bleeds green ooze onto Mulder. Mulder is pushed outside the sub, and shortly thereafter the vessel descends beneath the ice. Mulder's body is rushed to a military field hospital. Scully arrives at the scene. She realizes that Mulder has been infected with the alien retrovirus. She convinces physicians to lower Mulder's body temperature to counteract the virus. Her efforts are successful, and Mulder's life is saved.

A powerful, invisible force shakes the darkened, deserted streets of Fairfield, Idaho. Two janitors watch in horror as the force smashes a plate glass window and crumples a car. A construction worker is killed as the force rumbles down a highway. Then, suddenly, a ten-foot tall Indian elephant materializes out of thin air. The pachyderm runs off until, finally, it grows exhausted and lays on the ground. As residents of the community watch, saddened, the elephant dies.

Mulder and Scully investigate the incident. Mulder believes the invisible force and the elephant-whose name is Ganesha-are somehow connected. Ed Meecham, a worker at the Fairfield zoo, tells the agents that the animal's cage is still locked. At Meecham's suggestion, the agents question Willa Ambrose, a naturalist hired by the zoo's board of supervisors. Ambrose explains she was hired to redesign the zoo's restrictive pens to make them more humane environments. She explains that Meecham is from the "old school" and resents her involvement. Mulder and Scully interview Kyle Lang, an animal rights activist and member of the Wild Again Organization, who believes Ganesha was treated in an inhumane fashion by Meecham. But he is just as contemptuous towards Ambrose, whom he claims is attempting to gain custody of a gorilla so it can be kept in a cage at the zoo.

Believing that members of the W.A.O. are responsible for releasing the elephant, the agents stake out the zoo. One night, a red-haired boy sneaks into the zoo with a night-vision camera. The animals become enraged. As the boy watches, horrified, a tiger dematerializes inside its cage. An invisible force strikes at the boy, ripping him to pieces. Mulder becomes convinced that some invisible force-not an escaped tiger-is responsible for the boy's death. He is intrigued by reports that no animals kept at the zoo are able to reproduce. Scully performs an autopsy on the elephant, and discovers that it was once pregnant. Ambrose assures her that the animal could not possibly have given birth without her knowledge. Shortly thereafter, the missing tiger turns up at a construction site. The agents, Ambrose and Meecham attempt to capture the animal. But when the tiger charges Ambrose, Meecham kills it.

Mulder tells Ambrose about a theory of his involving aliens impregnating zoo animals for some unknown purpose. Using sign language, Ambrose questions Sophie. The gorilla relays her fears about a baby flying "into the light." Meanwhile, the zoo's board of directors, in an effort to cut costs, eliminates Ambrose's job. Sophie is prepped for her return to the wilderness despite Ambrose's conviction that the gorilla will be killed by poachers.

Kyle returns to the zoo one evening looking for Willa. Instead, he finds Sophie's empty cage. Suddenly, a large crate crashes into Kyle, killing him. Scully discovers evidence that Kyle was murdered with a cattle prod. She arrests Ambrose for his death. Ambrose admits she and Ed Meecham joined forces and transported Sophie to an abandoned factory.

When Mulder arrives at the factory, he finds Sophie in an uncontrollable rage. He and Meecham attempt to tranquilize the animal, but suddenly Meecham runs off, leaving Mulder alone with the gorilla. Sophie lashes out of the darkness and strikes Mulder. As Mulder loses consciousness, the animal disappears in a blinding flash of light. Later, Sophie's dead body is discovered on a roadside. Ambrose weeps and embraces the animal.

Eighteen survivors were rescued by a Canadian trawler, but only one, Lieutenant Richard Harper, survived the mysterious incident. Harper is admitted to the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland where he placed under tight security. Scully gains access to Harper's room. She is surprised to discover that Harper-who is twenty-eight years old-looks like an elderly man. Mulder is unsurprised when he hears the news. He tells Scully about the Philadelphia Experiment, a top secret World War II project in which the United States government attempted to render battleships invisible to radar. Not long afterward, the U.S.S. Eldridge vanished from a Philadelphia Navy Yard only to reappear minutes later, hundreds of miles away in Norfolk, Virginia. Mulder believes these events are linked to the Roswell Incident. He theorizes that government physicists may have been trying to manipulate worm holes on earth.

The agents travel to Norway in search of answers. They meet Henry Trondheim, the captain of a trawler called the Zeal. Trondheim tells of a legendary stone that Greenlanders believe is an evil god. Mulder and Scully hire Trondheim to navigate the treacherous waters and dense fog. Despite Trondheim's best efforts, his ship collides with the Ardent. The agents, accompanied by Trondheim and his first mate, Halvorsen, board the Ardent and discover dead bodies covered with a strange substance. Suddenly, the sound of an engine fills the air. The foursome race onto the ship's deck, only to see the Zeal disappearing into the fog. They realize they are stranded. A man's scream shatters the ghostly quiet. Mulder, Scully and Trondheim race to the ship's mess hall, where they discover Halvorsen's dead body. More sounds in the galley lead them to a faltering old man, Captain Phillip Barclay, who claims that his ship encountered a strange light that stopped time itself. A short time later, Barclay dies. A man named Olafssen, a pirate whaler and wanted criminal, suddenly rushes Trondheim. Mulder draws his weapon and order Olafssen to stop. A fight ensues between Trondheim and Olafssen, but Mulder convinces Trondheim that Olafssen, who has not aged, may hold clues to the mystery. The Ardent's log describes how four Norwegian sailors were rescued after their ship had sunk. This leads Trondheim to speculate that Olafssen's men stole his boat and left their leader stranded. Not long afterward, Scully, Mulder and Trondheim begin aging rapidly.

Scully develops a theory about the sudden aging. If the ship had drifted close to another massive metallic source-such as a meteorite-the resulting electromagnetic energy could excite free radicals, the elements suspected of causing aging. The agents suspect that drinking desalinized water from the ship's tanks is the source of the aging. But if Olafssen drank recycled sewage water, which does not come from the sea, it may have kept him from contracting the illness. While the agents are away, Olafssen tells Trondheim that drinking the recycled water will save his life. Trondheim kills Olafssen and begins drinking from a toilet bowl. With the recycled water supply dwindling rapidly, tension begins to escalate. Trondheim locks himself in the ship's sewage hold and backflushes all the water into a single tank. With no water left to drink, Scully improvises by combining sardine juice, limes, and the water from a snowglobe. But before either can consume the precious drinking water, the ship's outer hull gives way and the vessel is flooded. Trondheim is overcome by the freezing water and drowns. Scully and Mulder are rescued by helicopter, and doctors are able to revive them.

Mulder tells Scully about a series of identical attacks that occurred over a period of twenty-eight years in almost every state in America. One of the most recent involved Jerald Glazebrook, who performed as The Alligator Man in carnivals and circuses. The agents travel to Gibsonton, Florida, where they attend Glazebrook's funeral. They soon realize that most of the town's residents suffer from physical deformities, and that most work the side-show circuit. When Mulder takes an interest in a drawing found on a menu, Sheriff Hamilton directs the agents to Hepcat Helm, who operates and designs exhibits for a carnival fun house. Hepcat explains that the drawing on the menu depicts the Feejee Mermaid, an exhibit that P.T. Barnum called "the genuine fake" because it fooled no one. Mulder theorizes that the Feejee Mermaid may, in fact, be quite real.

The agents take rooms at a local trailer park run by a midget named Mr. Nutt. Lanny, a Siamese twin, helps the agents with their luggage. Later that night, while working alone in his workshop, Hepcat is murdered by a strange creature. A preliminary examination of Hepcat's body produces more questions than answers.

Later, the agents speak with Dr. Blockhead, who claims he has trained his body to accept acute pain. He demonstrates his abilities by driving a nail up into his nostril. Mulder aids Blockhead by removing the nail with a pair of pliers. Before the agents leave, they spot The Conundrum, a man who eats live animals and just about anything else he can fit in his mouth. Blockhead describes his friend as a "geek." Mulder keeps the nail taken from Blockhead's nose and has the blood analyzed, hoping it will match blood found at Hepcat's workshop. The blood samples match, but both turn out to be O positive.

Mulder tells Scully that he ran background checks on some of the local side-show performers. His most interesting discovery reveals that Sheriff Hamilton once performed as Jim-Jim, the Dog-Faced Boy. But after surveying Hamilton, the agents conclude he is not a suspect.

Soon afterward, Mr. Nutt becomes the killer's latest victim. The agents conclude that the murderer is so physically small that he was able to climb through the doggie door in Nutt's trailer. When a drunken Lanny learns of Nutt's death, he flies into a rage. He is arrested by Hamilton and transported to jail.

The agents approach Dr. Blockhead for further questioning. But Blockhead, a magician and escape artist, easily eludes them. Sheriff Hamilton detains Blockhead by grabbing hold of the fish hooks which pierce his skin. When the agents, Hamilton, and Blockhead arrive at the jail, they notice that Lanny is in pain. Scully realizes that Lanny's twin brother, Leonard, is capable of extracting himself from his brother's body. Lanny admits that Leonard is seeking another brother with whom he can co-join. The agents track Leonard into the fun house, but their efforts to capture him prove futile.

Later, Blockhead laments that due to advances in genetic engineering, people with severe abnormalities will not exist. Everyone in the future, he fears, will look like Mulder. Dr. Blockhead and the Conundrum, who suffers from a swollen stomach, pack up their belongings and prepare to leave town. As their vehicle hits the open road, Mulder and Scully realize that the Conundrum may have eaten Leonard.

@{fg shine}The Calusari [#44]@{fg text}

Mulder and Scully investigate the death of Teddy Holvey, a two-year-old child who was run over by a miniature train as he chased a floating helium balloon through a park. Photographs of the incident are analyzed by a laboratory. They reveal a strange amorphous form-not visible to the naked eye-that appears to be pulling the balloon in the direction of the train. This information leads Mulder to speculate that a poltergeist was somehow responsible.

The agents travel to Arlington, Virginia and interview Steve and Maggie Holvey. There, Mulder's interest is piqued by a gammadion, a symbol that resembles a reverse swastika. As the agents question the Holveys, an elderly Romanian woman, Golda, enters the room with their son Charlie, an eight-year-old boy. Golda intones that Charlie is evil and was responsible for Teddy's demise. But Scully believes Charlie and Teddy are the victims of Munchausen by proxy, in which a caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing medical symptoms.

Shortly thereafter, Steve is killed in a freak accident after his necktie is entangled in a garage door opener. While investigating the scene, the agents discover a strange ash around Steve's corpse. The substance, called Vibuti, is a holy ash produced during the presence of spiritual beings.

Several Rumanian men, known as Calusari, hold a mysterious religious ceremony involving dead roosters in Golda's room. It is interrupted when Charlie suffers a seizure. Shortly thereafter, Golda is attacked and killed by live roosters. Mulder suspects that Golda and the Calusari were trying to ward off evil from entering the house.

Charlie is transported to St. Matthew's Hospital for observation. A social worker, Karen Kosseff, questions the boy about Golda's murder. Charlie claims Golda was killed by the ghost of Michael, his stillborn twin. But Maggie insists Charlie was never told about his brother.

Michael's spectre appears in the hospital and attacks a nurse. Pretending to be Charlie, Michael tricks Maggie into believing he has been released from the hospital.

The agents discover the truth about Michael's spirit. As Mulder supervises a Calusari exorcism over Charlie's body, Scully races to the Holvey residence. Inside, she comes face to face with Michael, a knife clutched in his hand. As the exorcism at the hospital reaches its climax, Michael's ghost suddenly disappears, leaving behind only a trace of ash.

The Calusari leader warns Mulder and Scully that the evil now knows who they are.

Bobby Torence, a prisoner incarcerated at the Cumberland State Correctional Facility in Virginia, receives a mysterious package containing a pig's leg. Shortly after his exposure to the appendage, Bobby suffers several goiter-like protrusions on his face and neck. He is relocated to the prison infirmary, where two physicians, Auerbach and Osborne, attend to his lesions. Bobby's cell is later cleaned by two other convicts, Paul and Steve, who realize that the laundry cart offers them an opportunity for escape.

The FBI assigns Mulder and Scully to aid in the capture of the escapees. But the agents remain mystified as to why the Bureau is interested in the case. Scully's suspicions are aroused when Dr. Osborne claims he was sent to the facility by the Centers for Disease Control. He explains that a mysterious flu-like illness has taken the lives of ten prisoners, and that the escaped convicts may be carriers of the disease. Scully realizes that the bodies of the dead prisoners are marked for incineration. Osborne catches Scully sneaking about the cadavers. As Scully watches, horrified, a pustule on a cadaver suddenly bursts, spraying Osborne with a white fluid.

Meanwhile, Paul and Steve murder a man and steal his motor home. At a gas station, Paul places a call to his girlfriend, Elizabeth, informing her of his freedom. Angelo, a gas station attendant, finds Steve doubled-over in pain inside a restroom. Paul knocks Angelo unconscious with a tire iron and he and Steve escape. Mulder and members of the U.S. Marshal's office find Angelo's unconscious body at the station. Mulder traces the last phone call made at the gas station's pay phone to Elizabeth's residence.

The convicts make their way to Elizabeth's home. But Steve's condition worsens. Without warning, a pustule on Steve's skin bursts open, spraying Elizabeth with puss. Mulder and the marshals storm Elizabeth's home, but they arrive too late. Steve is already dead, and Paul is not to be found.

Scully traces the package mailed to Bobby Torrence to a company called Pinck Pharmaceutical. While examining Bobby's corpse, she pulls the hard slender carapace of a dead insect from an open boil. Osborne, who is near death, tells Scully that he works not for the CDC, but for Pinck Pharmaceutical. He explains how the company regularly finances the exploration of rain forests for potential drug application. A field entomologist sent the lab samples of an insect, Faciophagia Emasculata, which is parasitic in nature and attacks the human immune syndrome. Now the company-and the government-are trying to cover-up the fact that prisoners were used as Guinea pigs for Pinck Pharmaceutical's experiments.

Aided by information supplied by Elizabeth, Mulder tracks Paul to a bus station. Realizing that Paul is the only remaining person who can testify against the government and Pinck Pharmaceutical, Mulder tries taking him alive. But a sniper's bullet rings out, killing Paul.

The agents are called to a hotel in Richmond, Virginia by Detective Kelly Ryan, one of Scully's ex-pupils at the academy. Ryan, who is working her first case, is stymied by the disappearance of several people. The latest victim, Patrick Newirth, vanished from his hotel room. The only clue to his whereabouts is a mysterious scorched pattern burned into the carpet beneath the door to his room. Mulder notices that a light bulb in the room had been unscrewed from its socket. He had it dusted for finger prints.

The agents travel to the residence of another victim. There they discover another loose light bulb and a scorch mark. Among the items found in the victim's trash is a train ticket. The agents realize that all three victims traveled through the Richmond train station before they died. Policemen are dispatched to stake out the station. They attempt to stop a man, Chester Ray Banton, for questioning, but Banton runs away from them. Cornered in two bright pools of light, Banton warns the officers to stay back. When the officers step on his shadows, they vaporize in a fiery burst of light.

Mulder and Scully review video footage recorded by the train station's security system. They discover that Banton sat around the station for days staring at the ground. An insignia on his clothing leads them to a company called Polarity Magnetics, where aDr. Davey gives the agents a tour of the facility. Davey explains how Banton, who is a scientist, performed research on dark matter such as quantum particles, quarks and neutrinos. One day, according to Davey, Banton became trapped inside a particle accelerator room and was exposed to a massive amount of energy-which literally burned his shadow right into a wall.

Mulder reviews the videotaped security footage and realizes Banton was sitting in an area where florescent lighting did not cast any shadows. Shortly thereafter, the agents corner Banton at the station. Again, he warns them to stay back. As his shadow creeps towards Scully, Mulder raises his gun and shoots an overhead light bulb, plunging the area into darkness. Banton is relieved.

Banton is transported to a psychiatric hospital and imprisoned in a room with soft light. During an interview, Banton insists to Mulder that the government is hunting him down in an effort to learn his secrets. Detective Ryan then informs the agents that their services on the case are no longer required.

Frustrated, Mulder seeks out X, his shadowy government contact. But X insists he cannot be of any help to him. A short time thereafter, X and some paramedics attempt to kidnap Banton from the psychiatric facility. The paramedics come in contact with Banton's shadow and are vaporized. The scientist emerges from his room and escapes.

Banton returns to Polarity Magnetics intent on destroying himself inside the particle accelerator. Detective Ryan arrives at the scene and attempts to arrest Banton, but she comes into contact with his shadow and is instantly vaporized. Banton convinces Davey to engage the accelerator once he's inside. But once Banton enters the chamber, he realizes Davey is a government operative. X, however, kills Davey, then transports Banton to a secret research facility for examination and testing.

The agents travel to the small town of Dudley, Arkansas after George Kearns, a Federal Poultry Inspector, mysteriously disappears. Aided by Sheriff Arens, Mulder and Scully examine a field where a resident had reported sighting a foxfire burning. They find evidence that some sort of ceremony had taken place in the field. George Kearns's wife is then interviewed, but she believes her husband, a known womanizer, ran off with someone younger.

A visit to Chaco Chicken, the meat processing plant that George had threatened to close to due repeated health violations, leads to Paula Gray, the woman George had been having an affair with. She suddenly grows violent and tries to kill Jess Harold, a supervisor at the plant. But the sheriff draws his gun and fires, killing her before she can slash Harold's throat.

The agents interview Walter Chaco, the owner of the plant and Paula's grandfather. He grants them permission to perform an autopsy on the girl's body. After the autopsy, Scully concludes that Paula suffered from a rare degenerative illness called Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease... the same illness carried by George Kearns. She also learns the youthful-looking Paula was 47 years old.

After a near-miss with a chicken delivery truck that plunges into a polluted lake, Mulder orders that the water be dredged in hopes of finding George's body. What the agents find beneath the lake, however, is dozens of human bones. Mulder runs a missing persons check and confirms that as many as 87 people within a 200 mile radius of the town have been reported missing in the last 50 years. He begins to suspect that a cult of cannibals is systematically killing people and eating their flesh to stay forever young.

Doris Kearns approaches Walter Chaco and tells him she can no longer keep what she knows about the town a secret. Jesse Harold warns Chaco that the woman is unstable; but Chaco insists it is the FBI they should be worried about. Nonetheless, Harold has Doris Kearns killed. When Scully arrives at the Kearns' residence, she is taken captive.

Mulder returns to Chaco's estate and finds a multitude of human skulls stored within a cabinet. When he realizes Scully has been abducted, Mulder races to the site of a blazing foxfire. The townspeople turn on Walter Chaco and execute him. As Sheriff Arens, a cult member, prepares to eliminate Scully, a shot rings out. Mulder, gun in hand, rushes to Scully's aid. Pandemonium breaks out, and the cult members rush from the scene, trampling Jesse as he tries to retrieve a gun.

Scully later concludes that the outbreak of Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease was spread by cannibalism.

A computer hacker nicknamed The Thinker gains access to top secret Defense Department files on extraterrestrial life. He gives Mulder the files on a computer diskette-with the proviso that government officials be held responsible for UFO cover-ups throughout the years. Mulder's initial enthusiasm is dampened when he realizes the files are encoded in Navajo. But Scully promises to find a translator as soon as possible. When Skinner questions Mulder about the rumor he possesses sensitive information, Mulder suddenly punches him.

Mulder is at a loss for his inexplicable behavior. Skinner later informs Scully that a disciplinary hearing will determine if Mulder is to be dismissed without reinstatement.

The Cigarette-Smoking Man pays Mulder's father an unexpected visit on Martha's Vineyard. He informs him about the top secret files falling into his son's hands. Mr. Mulder realizes his name is on those files. He telephones his son and asks him to come home. Later, Scully lets herself into Mulder's apartment when he fails to answer his door. Suddenly, a gunshot rings out, smashing a window. Scully narrowly avoids injury.

When Mulder arrives at Martha's Vineyard, his father speaks cryptically about his work for the State Department. Before he can explain the truth, Alex Krycek shoots and kills him. When Scully learns of the killing, she urges Mulder to leave Martha's Vineyard less the authorities suspect him of the murder.

When Mulder returns home, he is very ill. Scully attends to his sickness. She notices a suspicious delivery person carting a soft water canister to the basement of the apartment building.

Mulder spots Alex Krycek sneaking around outside his apartment building. He wrestles the agent to the ground and grabs his revolver. Certain that Mulder is about to kill Krycek, Scully draws her weapon and shoots Mulder in the chest.

When Mulder regains consciousness, he is lying in a motel room in New Mexico, his bullet wound having been ministered by Scully. She explains that lab tests revealed that water flowing into Mulder's apartment building was spiked with a strong hallucinogen, explaining Mulder's aggressive behavior.

An Indian man named Albert Hosteen begins translating the encoded Defense Department files. He explains to Mulder how a tribe of Indians who once lived in New Mexico disappeared without a trace. Their name was Anasazi, which means Ancient Aliens. Albert believes they were abducted by visitors from another planet. Albert's nephew Eric leads Mulder out into the desert. There, Eric shows the agent a railroad train boxcar buried in a rock quarry. Inside the car are the corpses of what appear to be alien beings. The Smoking Man calls Mulder on his cellular phone. He claims that Mulder's father authorized the project. But Mulder insists he will expose the Smoking Man.

The Smoking Man traces Mulder's location by pinpointing the source of the cellular phone transmission. But when he arrives in the desert by helicopter, Mulder is not to be found. The Smoking Man orders his men to destroy the boxcar.

A team of camouflaged soldiers, lead by The Cigarette-Smoking Man, searches for Mulder and the computer tape believed to be in his possession. Albert Hosteen and his family are interrogated and beaten, and Scully-whose visit to the smoldering boxcar produces no leads-is detained, searched, and questioned. But the Cigarette-Smoking Man's efforts are in vain.

At F.B.I. headquarters, Scully is given a mandatory leave of absence until a review board investigates the nature of her insubordination. Crestfallen, Scully returns home to her family. She tells her mother she erred by countermanding her superiors. When Scully returns to Washington, Frohike informs her The Thinker-the computer hacker who accessed the MJ files-was professionally executed by unknown assailants. When Scully approaches Skinner with the news, and theorizes how Mulder and The Thinker could have been gunned down by the same individuals, Skinner shows interest only in the missing computer tape.

Meanwhile, Albert and his family investigate when buzzards begin circling high above the New Mexico desert. They find Mulder's limp, lifeless body near a tunnel in the red rock quarry. He is transported to a Navajo hogan, an igloo-like dome of mud, where a healing ritual called The Blessing Way is performed over his body. As the ceremony progresses, Mulder's soul encounters a bridge spanning two worlds. He encounters visions of Deep Throat, and his father, and of the aliens trapped inside the boxcar. On the third day of the ritual, the Navajos watch as Mulder regains consciousness.

While passing through a security checkpoint at FBI headquarters, Scully sets off a metal detector. A security guard waves a magnetic wand near her neck and again trips the security alarm. Puzzled, Scully visits the medical lab, where a physician removes a computer chip from beneath her skin. Melissa convinces her sister to visit Dr. Pomerantz, a hypnotist. While under hypnosis, Scully encounters repressed visions of men, lights and alarms.

Having recovered from his close brush with death, Mulder returns to his mother's home in Martha's Vineyard. He searches for clues about his father and the people he worked with, certain they will lead him to his missing sister.

While attending Mr. Mulder's funeral, Scully is approached by a Well-Manicured Man. The stranger claims Mulder is dead, and that a hit squad is out to kill her. Later, Skinner approaches Scully outside her apartment. The pair drive to Mulder's apartment, where a very suspicious Scully pulls out a revolver and demands Skinner answer her questions.

Searching through Scully's darkened apartment, Alex Krycek and his assistant encounter Melissa. A shot rings out and Melissa slumps to the floor.

As the standoff between Scully and Skinner continues, someone approaches the front door to Mulder's apartment. Catching Scully off-guard, Skinner pulls out a gun.

@{fg shine}Paper Clip [#50]@{fg text}

As the standoff between Scully and Skinner continues... Mulder bursts through the front door of his apartment and orders Skinner to drop his weapon. Skinner complies, then produces the computer disk containing the Defense Department's top secret files on extraterrestrial life. He realizes the disk is the only leverage the trio has in bringing Mr. Mulder's killers to justice, and insists on keeping it himself. Mulder and Scully examine an old group photograph of Mr. Mulder with his government colleagues. With the Lone Gunmen's help, Mulder and Scully identify a man named Victor Klemper from the group. Klemper is a Nazi War criminal and a participant in Operation Paper Clip, a U.S. government operation that provided safe haven for war criminals in exchange for their scientific knowledge. Before the agents interview Klemper, Scully learns that her sister Melissa is in critical condition at a nearby hospital. But fearing an ambush by assassins, Scully joins Mulder in his quest to locate Klemper.

The agents elicit little information from the elderly Klemper, except that the group photo was taken at the Strughold Mining Company in West Virginia, and his mention of Napier's Constant, the base of all natural logarithms.

When the agents visit the ramshackle mine, they discover heavy metal doors built into the rocky walls of the mountainside. The agents gain access by entering Napier's Constant into an electronic keypad. Inside, they find a seemingly endless row of filing cabinets containing files and tissue samples on hundreds of U.S. citizens. Their search is interrupted when a U.F.O. drops from the sky. Simultaneously, a government hit squad surrounds the building. Mulder comes under fire and runs for cover. He and Scully find an escape route and make their way to safety.

Skinner pays a visit to the hospital where Melissa is being monitored. There he meets Mrs. Scully, and Albert Hosteen, who prays for Melissa's recovery. Skinner is alerted to a shadowy figure monitoring the room. In a darkened stairwell, he is attacked by Krycek and his accomplice. They overpower Skinner and steal the computer disk.

Mulder and Scully make a second trip to question Klemper, but when they arrive, they are informed by the Well-Manicured Man that Klemper is dead. Mulder recognizes him as one of the people in his father's group photograph. The Well-Manicured Man recounts how, in 1947, a spacecraft was reportedly recovered in New Mexico. This event coincided with the formation of Operation Paper Clip. Mulder suspects that Klemper was experimenting with the creation of a super race-a hybridization of humans and aliens. The files stored in the mountain, Mulder realizes, are vaccination records on hundreds of millions of Americans who received smallpox vaccinations-a DNA database of virtually everyone born since the 1950s.

Skinner threatens to expose the Cigarette-Smoking Man if any harm should befall Mulder or Scully. He reveals that Albert Hosteen-who read the computer disks-spread the contents amongst his Navajo people in the ancient oral tradition, chapter and verse, file for file.

Later, Mulder visits Scully at the hospital, and learns that Melissa passed away during surgery.

Darin Oswald, a nineteen-year-old resident of Connerville, Oklahoma, argues with twenty-one-year-old Jack Hammond over a video arcade game. The altercation escalates, and Jack, by far the bigger of the two, knocks Darin to the floor. Moments later, the electricity within the arcade seemingly falls under Darin's power. Frightened, Jack runs to his automobile and attempts to drive away. But an intense electrical field engulfs the car, killing Jack.

As Mulder and Scully examine Jack's body, the local coroner describes how five other young people were killed in the same manner. Sheriff Jack Teller corrects the coroner's statement, noting four people died but one survived. Scully believes it is statistically improbably for so many people in such a small area to have been struck by lightning-especially when only 60 people die of being struck by lightning each year in the United States.

Nonetheless, Mulder and Scully visit the video arcade. Darin's friend, Zero, who works at the arcade and witnessed the killing, acts suspiciously and provides little help. But Mulder notices the initials "D.P.O." logged on a video game's list of top scorers. The initials match those of Darin Peter Oswald-the one victim who survived being stuck by lightning.

While working at a local garage, Darin approaches Sharon Kiveat, a former high school teacher. Darin harbors a crush on the attractive woman, but he is unable to act upon his fantasies because Sharon is married to his boss, Frank. Later, the agents pay a visit to the garage and interview Darin about Jack's death. Darin claims he was so wrapped up in his game he did not notice what had happened. During the interview, Mulder's cell phone suddenly and inexplicably melts.

The next day, the agents examine a field where several cows were killed by lightning. They discover a fulgarite, an area where the lightning fused sandy soil into glass. Imbedded within the fulgarite is a shoe print. Scully makes a cast of the print and discovers it came from a size eight and a half military boot. She also finds a small quantity of antifreeze within the glass, which Mulder deduces came from the garage. The agents visit Darin's home, and discover that his shoe size is eight and a half. They also find Sharon Kiveat's photograph.

Using his powers, Darin alters a traffic light signal and causes an automobile accident. Frank drives his tow truck to the scene to remove the vehicles. Darin then causes Frank to collapse. Paramedics rush to his aid, but find their defibrillator inoperative. Darin rushes to Frank's side and revives him.

Scully examines Darin's medical history and discovers he suffers from a severe chemical imbalance. Mulder theorizes how the electrolyte imbalance might enable Darin to generate electricity levels much higher than normal. The agents take Darin into custody, but Sheriff Teller releases him do to the improbable nature of the charges. Darin travels to the video arcade. There, a terrified Zero insists he did not squeal on his friend. Zero tries to escape, but Darin kills him by generating a lightning bolt.

Darin proceeds to the hospital and enters Frank's room looking for Sharon. Instead, he finds Scully, her gun drawn. Sharon ends the showdown by agreeing to follow Darin outside. Sharon suddenly breaks free and runs to safety. When Teller and Mulder surround the teenager, he summons a lightning bolt. The energy kills Teller and knocks Darin to the ground, unconscious. He is arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital.

A lanky, seemingly amiable man, hereon referred to as The Puppet, pays a visit to Madame Zelma at a palm reader shop. When Madame Zelma seems more interested in taking The Puppet's money than predicting his future, The Puppet strangles her.

Meanwhile, Mulder and Scully are asked to assist in a murder investigation wherein several "professional prognosticators" were gruesomely murdered-and their entrails evidentally arranged in an attempt to divine the future. Later, a man named Clyde Bruckman, an insurance salesman, discovers Madame Zelma's body in a dumpster outside his apartment. As the agents interview Bruckman, it becomes apparent he possesses detailed knowledge about the killings, leading Mulder to believe Bruckman is a true psychic. Bruckman suspects that the killer may also possess psychic powers. He predicts another victim will surface the following day floating in a lake.

When Bruckman's vision proves correct, Mulder asks him for assistance in finding the killer. Bruckman fears that interfering with fate might adversely alter the future. Meanwhile, Scully discovers that all of the victims had in their possession a keychain from an investment firm that provides market strategies based on astrological forecasts. Bruckman accurately predicts that the firm's owner was murdered and buried in a forest.

Later, Bruckman describes how Mulder, at some point in the future, will step in a pie-and then meet his fate at the hands of the murderer. When a tarot card reader is murdered, Mulder and Scully assign Agent Havez to guard Bruckman at a hotel, fearing the killer may sense his whereabouts. As Scully inspects clues at the murder scene, she realizes the murderer is the bellhop (The Puppet) at the hotel. When The Puppet arrives at Bruckman's hotel room to serve him his meal, both men sense each other's psychic vibes. The Puppet kills Havez, then runs from the room. Mulder and Scully arrive at the hotel and spot the bellhop racing away from the scene. Mulder follows The Puppet into the hotel's kitchen, where he steps in a pie. Recognizing the prophetic sign, Mulder spins around, and is able to deflect his attacker's blow momentarily. But as The Puppet poises to strike Mulder with a knife, Scully exits from the elevator and fires her gun, killing The Puppet.

Later, the agents find Bruckman's body at his apartment. The agents realize he took his own life.

Napoleon "Neech" Manley, a well-liked prison inmate on death row, is strapped into an electric chair and killed. Several days later a prison guard is found dead in the very cell Neech had occupied for eleven years. Mulder tells Scully that Neech strongly believed in reincarnation, and swore he would return from the grave to take vengeance on five men who mistreated him.

The agents travel to the prison, where they examine the guard's corpse and the cell where his body was discovered. The Warden suspects that Neech's inmate friends are responsible for the murder. Mulder interviews Neech's friend, Speranza, who firmly believes Neech's spirit killed the guard. Later, a prison guard named Parmelly pulls Scully into the shower area and tells her about the existence of a list which names the five men Neech's spirit intends to kill. Parmelly claims an inmate named Roque possesses the list.

Soon after, an inmate opens a paint can and discovers the head of prison guard Fornier inside. Mulder interviews Roque, who offers to recite the names of the men on the list in exchange for a transfer. The Warden balks at the idea of negotiating with prisoners. Suspecting that he might be on the list, the Warden interrogates Roque in the shower area, and beats him up. When Roque's body is later discovered, Mulder suspects he may not be the third victim from Neech's list. His suspicion is confirmed by Speranza. Mulder and Scully travel to the home of the man who engaged the power on the electric chair that killed Neech. They find his maggot-infested body in the attic.

Scully reviews phone records indicating a man named Danny Charez spoke with Neech on many occasions. Charez, who was once Neech's defense attorney, tells the agents he is now helping Speranza-hoping he has some sway with Neech's spirit. Later, Charez is attacked and killed.

Working on a tip from Charez, the agents realize Parmelly and Neech's wife, Danielle, are lovers. One night, Danielle realizes Neech has inhabited Parmelly's body. As the agents surround the Manley home, Danielle pulls out a gun and shoots Parmelly. Later, Neech's spirit materializes in the Warden's car. Neech claims his last victim by killing the Warden.

Mulder and Scully assist Cleveland Detective Alan Cross with the investigation into a brutal homicide in which a female victim's body is so badly decomposed, and covered with a mucus-like slime, that positive identification is difficult. Mulder connects the case to a series of similar killings in which female victims-all of whom answered personal ads in local newspapers-died in a similar manner. When the latest victim, Lauren Mackalvey, is identified, Mulder locates her roommate, Jennifer. Jennifer explains how Lauren meet her date on the Internet, a man who went by the on-line name "2Shy." Meanwhile, Scully's autopsy on Lauren's body reveals that a great deal of her body fat is missing.

Meanwhile, when the killer, Virgil Incanto, gets stood up by his on-line date, Ellen, he attacks and murders a prostitute. During the struggle, the prostitute scraps Virgil with her nails, leaving rake marks on his arm.

Mulder examines the killer's e-mail correspondence to Lauren. He discovers quotations from rare Italian poems, leading him to believe the suspect is a college professor or translator. Cross assembles a list of people in the Cleveland area with such credentials. Chemical analysis of the killer's skin sample found beneath the prostitute's fingernails shows no oils or fatty acids-leading Mulder to speculate that the murderer might be using his victim's bodies to replenish a chemical deficiency in order to survive.

Meanwhile, using Cross's list, the agents interview possible suspects. But it is Cross who ends up interviewing Virgil, and in the process, notes a bandage on his arm. Virgil kills Cross, then arranges another date using the Internet. When his intended victim, Ellen, drives him home, Virgil spots someone inside his apartment. He hastily excuses himself. Virgil's nosy landlady, Monica, discovers Cross's decomposed body inside the apartment. Virgil kills Monica before she can scream. But Monica's blind daughter, Jesse, enters Virgil's apartment looking for her mother. Though Virgil insists Monica is not in the apartment, Jesse smells her mother's perfume. Jesse calls 911, and the agents rush to the apartment building. But Virgil is not to be found.

The agents access Virgil's computer records, hoping to find clues about his next victim. Meanwhile, Virgil talks his way into Ellen's apartment, apologizing for his hasty exit during their date. As Ellen sends a computer message to an on-line friend, a message from the F.B.I.-warning about Virgil-pops up on her screen. Virgil sees the message and attacks Ellen. After cracking Virgil's computer hard drive, the agents contact women who are his potential next victims. Unable to reach Ellen by phone, the agents drive to her apartment. Mulder and Scully, acting on a tip from a neighbor, burst into Ellen's apartment. As Mulder searches for Virgil, Scully stays behind with Ellen, who is covered with mucus but still alive. Suddenly, Virgil springs from the shadows and attacks Scully. Ellen, however, regains consciousness, and shoots Virgil. Virgil recovers from the gunshot wound, and is later interrogated.

Lieutenant Colonel Victor Stans locks himself inside a rehabilitation room at an army hospital intent on committing suicide. The water temperature of a whirlpool tub is raised to the boiling point, and Stans approaches, ready to throw himself in. As a disembodied voice speaks to Stans, glass on an alarm box smashes, and the deadbolt lock to the rehab room door slides open, as if moved by an invisible force. Stans throws himself into the scalding tub, but he is quickly rescued by a nurse and firemen.

Mulder and Scully turn their attention to the case. Stans tells them a sort of phantom soldier, whom he's never seen clearly, killed his wife and child, and now wishes to see him suffer by not letting him take his own life. The agents are approached by Army Captain Janet Draper, who requests a suspension of whatever investigation the F.B.I. has begun. Protocol requires any criminal investigation of military personnel to be conducted through military channels and the superior officer.

Mulder and Scully turn to General Callahan, who accuses them of gross misconduct and labels Stans' misfortune a tragic accident. But Scully notes a similar case involving Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen, who also served with Callahan in the Gulf War. Aiklen claimed he, too, was prevented from killing himself by an unseen force after his family died in a tragic "accident." After the agents leave, Callahan is visited by the phantom soldier, who appears in the reflection of a window. Shortly thereafter, Draper is drowned when water from a swimming pool assumes human form and attacks her.

Mulder warns Callahan that if the pattern is at all consistent, his family may be in great danger. Callahan reluctantly admits he was visited by the phantom soldier the previous night. When Callahan returns home, his wife describes how their son Trevor saw a stranger inside the house. Scully notices someone inside the Callahan's backyard, but he escapes. A fingerprint check leads the agents to Quentin Freely, nicknamed Roach. He is charged with murder. A search of Roach's apartment turns up mail from each of the victim's homes. But shortly thereafter, as a military MP stands guard, sand from a sandbox takes human form and attacks Trevor, killing him.

During interrogation, Roach claims he is merely the "mailman" for a fellow vet named Leonard Trimble, nicknamed Rappo. The agents rush to the army hospital, where they are told Rappo is a quadruple amputee. When Mulder and Scully return to Roach's cell, they find his dead body, a bed sheet stuffed down his throat. Mulder suspects that Rappo is capable of astral projection-the ability to leave his own body and travel virtually anywhere. Before Callahan and his wife can pack up their belongings and leave, Mrs. Callahan is murdered. Despondent, Callahan seeks out Stans. He pulls out a gun and attempts to shoot himself, but the gun will not fire. Stans insists he knows the identity of the killer. Callahan enters Rappo's room at the hospital. But after conversing with the amputee, Callahan decides not to kill him.

As Callahan attempts to leave the hospital, steam pipes in the sub-basement rupture. Callahan is engulfed by the hissing steam, from which emerges the phantom soldier. Mulder comes to the general's aid, but he, too, is attacked by the force. Meanwhile, Stans gains access to Rappo's room. He locks the door, and using a pillow, smothers the amputee, killing him. Back in the sub-basement, the invisible force dissipates.

The agents arrive at the home of Amy Jacobs, a fifteen-year-old girl abducted from her bedroom by a stranger. Agent Eubanks points out several drops of blood found on the carpet, the result of Amy's nosebleed. Mulder is intrigued by a report about a woman employed at a fast food restaurant who uttered the same words spoken by the stranger at the exact moment the kidnapping occurred. That woman, Lucy Householder, had been rushed to the hospital after suffering a seizure and a nosebleed. Records indicate that Lucy was kidnapped, at the age of eight, while her parents slept. She was held hostage in a basement for five years, and although she eventually was released unharmed, her abductor was never caught.

When Mulder and Scully confront Lucy about the incident at the restaurant, she becomes uncooperative, insisting she cannot help locate the missing girl. Eubanks uncovers evidence of Lucy's criminal record, including prostitution and narcotics convictions.

Lucy's psychic visions into Amy's mind continue to terrify her. She experiences temporary blindness- the result of Amy's being locked away in a darkened basement room, or oubliette. Mulder again asks Lucy for her help, but she insists she cannot locate Amy.

Scully uncovers evidence that every student from Amy Jacob's class received their school photograph-except for Amy. A photographer from Larkin Scholastic fired his assistant, Carl Wade, the day after the shoot. Mulder shows Lucy a current photograph of Wade, and her face registers recognition. Wade is the same man who kidnapper Lucy years earlier. Meanwhile, Amy successfully digs a hole through the oubliette, and escapes. Wade gives chase-and at the same time, Mulder chases Lucy as she flees the half-way house where she lives. As Amy loses her footing and tumbles down a rocky bank, landing on her arm, Lucy falls and injures her arm. Lucy looks to Mulder, wondering what is happening to her.

Meanwhile, Eubanks arrives at the half-way house with DNA lab results confirming that the blood found on Lucy's clothing matches Amy's. Mulder insists it would be impossible for Lucy to have any connection with the crime.

A tow truck driver comes forward and identifies Wade as a stranded motorist he encountered on a rural road. The tip leads agents to the town where Lucy was found seventeen years earlier. Working from an address registered at a local photography store, the agents pinpoint the remote cabin where Wades resides. But when they storm the cabin, the agents find Lucy huddled in the oubliette.

Lucy's words indicate Amy and Wade are in water. Mulder realizes this can only mean a nearby river. Wade, realizing his time with Amy has grown short, pushes her beneath the water. As Amy drowns, Lucy, detained by F.B.I. agents in the back seat of a car, begins to suffocate. Agents call for paramedics.

Mulder and Scully locate Amy's lifeless body on the riverbank and begin CPR. Their efforts prove futile. But suddenly, Amy begins coughing, water pouring from her mouth. Simultaneously, Lucy continues choking. Though Amy is successfully revived, Lucy dies. An autopsy later reveals five liters of water in Lucy's lungs. Mulder and Scully speculate that Lucy died for Amy-and that perhaps it was the only way she could outrun her past.

With great interest, Mulder views a mail order videotape which purportedly contains an actual alien autopsy. The footage shows a team of Japanese surgeons performing the procedure. The tape suddenly ends when a group of armed soldiers storms the operating room. Mulder and Scully trace the tape's origin to a video piracy operation in Allentown, Pennsylvania. When the agents arrive at the scene, they find a man's body with a pillowcase tied over its head. Mulder chase a Japanese man fleeing the scene and takes him into custody. Skinner reveals that the suspect, Kazuo Takeo, is a high-ranking government official from the Japanese diplomatic corps.

Mulder searches Takeo's leather satchel, uncovering satellite photos and a list of names containing members of the Mutual UFO Network. Mulder learns that the satellite photos contain images of a salvage ship named the Talapus, which spent months searching for a Japanese sub sunk during World War II. The ship made port in Newport News, Virginia, leading to speculation that perhaps the Talapus found something other than the downed sub.

The list of Mutual UFO Network members leads the agents to a Lottie Holloway and Penny Northern. They tell Scully that she is one of them. Confused, Scully insists she is conducting an FBI investigation into the murder of Steve Zinnzser (the man found with the pillow case over his head). The women tell the agents that Zinnzser was a member of their group. They also describe their experiences in a "bright white place," triggering Scully's partial memory of what transpired during her disappearance. The women display small pieces of metal which were surgically removed from the back of their necks. They bring Scully to the hospital, where another member of their group, Betsy Hagopian, is dying of an undiagnosed cancer ailment. Penny claims everyone who was abducted will die in the same fashion.

Meanwhile, Mulder travels to Virginia where he discovers the Talapus hidden between much larger vessels. Nearby, Mulder discovers an airplane hangar that houses a large circular object-which the Talapus must have dredged from the bottom of the sea.

Skinner tells Mulder that the Japanese diplomat was found murdered. Later, Mulder visits Senator Matheson, who requests the return of the satellite photographs. Mulder believes that doing so would entangle him in the murder investigation. In a cryptic gesture, Matheson gives Mulder a list containing the names of four murdered Japanese scientists.

Scully and Mulder meet at FBI headquarters. Mulder displays a photograph of Japanese medical officers taken during World War II. Four of the men are the same surgeons found murdered the previous day. Mulder suspects that the scientists were trying to create a human-alien hybrid, a continuation of their work, and similar work done by the Nazis, during the war. He suspects that the U.S. government may be behind the murders. Mulder also shows Scully a photo of train cars which he believes are part of the government's secret railroad, one of which was used to carry out the alien autopsy.

Mulder travels to Quinnimont, West Virginia, where he discovers train cars from the satellite photos. As Mulder prepares to jump onto one of the moving cars, Scully contacts him on his cellular phone. She passes on information, given to her by X, that his life is in great danger. Nonetheless, Mulder jumps on top of the train car.

X tells Scully that the metallic implant (which was surgically removed from the back of her neck) is the key to all the answers she's been searching for.

Meanwhile, Mulder - who clings precariously to the top of a train bound for Canada - makes his way to safety and climbs aboard one of the cars. He the car which is quarantined and cut off from the rest of the train. With assistance from the train's conductor, Mulder searches for Dr. Shiro Zama, whom he suspects is behind the experiments. But the Red-Haired Man (an assassin who murdered the Japanese diplomat in the previous episode), kills Zama and hides his body inside a lavoratory.

With the aid of Agent Pendrell, Scully learns that the implant collects information and artificially replicates a person's mental processes. Pendrell discovers the name of the chip's manufacturer, a Japanese firm, and traces a delivery to Dr. Zama at Hansen's Disease Research Facility in Virginia. Scully attempts to contact Mulder by cellular phone to relay the information, but unknown to her, Mulder dropped the device when he jumped onto the train. Scully drives to the research facility, where she encounters Escalante, a hideously deformed man. Escalante explains that the facility was once a leper colony, but the staff, including Zama, fled when death squads arrived to kill the patients. Escalante was being treated for leprosy, but hundreds of other patients were interned at the camp with symptoms that resembled the disease. The creatures were kept apart from the patients and apparently tortured.

Meanwhile, Mulder finds Zama's body inside the lavoratory. He is suddenly attacked by the Red-Haired Man. With the conductor's help, Mulder overcomes him. The Red-Haired Man claims the quarantined car is rigged with an explosive device, which was installed by Zama in case he could not escape to Canada with his creature. Mulder and his captive are unable to leave the quarantined car out of fear that opening the door without the proper access code might detonate the bomb.

Scully is captured by soldiers and brought before an Elder, a member of the Syndicate. He explains how Zama-a brilliant scientist whose real name is Ishimaru-was hidden in the U.S. after World War II so he could continue his experiments. But Ishimaru kept his discoveries secret, unwilling to share his knowledge with the government that had granted him asylum. Scully and the Elder dial the Red-Haired Man's cellular number and contact Mulder. Scully believes the creature aboard the train isn't an alien being after all. She's convinced Ishimaru used the railroad to conduct secret radiation tests on lepers, the homeless, and the insane. As proof, she reminds Mulder about the President's public apology for secret radiation tests that were conducted on innocent people until 1974. Only those tests never ended.

The quarantined car is uncoupled from the train in an isolated area. Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man about the creature, and theorizes how Zama developed a human-alien hybrid with super immunity, capable of withstanding the effects of atomic and biological weapons.

Scully reviews the alien autopsy tape and realizes Zama was caught on video punching in the proper code to open the door of the quarantine car. She phones Mulder with the code. But before he can exit the car, Mulder is attacked by the Red-Haired Man. X arrives, shoots the Red-Haired Man, and rescues Mulder moments before the train car explodes.

@{fg shine}Revelations [#59]@{fg text}

The agents travel to Pennsylvania to investigate the mysterious death of Reverend Finley, a self-proclaimed Stigmatic whose palms suddenly bled as his rapt congregation looked on in awe. Mulder recalls a series of international, religiously-motivated murders in which the victims were all false Stigmatics-just like Reverend Finley. Scully notes ligature marks on Finley's neck, suggesting strangulation.

Meanwhile, in Loveland, Ohio, fifth grade student Kevin Kryder begins bleeding at the palms as his teacher, Mrs. Tynes, and fellow classmates look on in horror. The agents are informed by Carina Maywald, a Social Services worker, that Kevin's father, Michael, was institutionalized after he proclaimed the boy was the son of God. Mulder theorizes that Kevin may have inflicted the wounds on himself in protest over his father's incarceration. Now, Mulder fears the boy may become a target for the Stigmata killer.

At the mental institution, Michael Kryder professes his belief that "Forces of Darkness" are out to eliminate his son and thereby trigger Armageddon. But he also believes that God will chose someone to protect Kevin and avert catastrophe. Surprisingly, Scully places more faith in the story than does Mulder.

Kevin is kidnapped from a social services dormitory by a bald, frightening-looking man. Based on a description from children at the dormitory, Mrs. Kryder identifies the man as Owen Jarvis, a gardener. The agents storm Jarvis' home and take him into custody. But Kevin has run off. Owen claims God told him to protect the boy. Using great strength, Owen breaks his handcuffs and runs to the Kryder home. He finds the Millennium Man (the same man who murdered Reverend Finley) preparing to murder Kevin. A fight ensues, and the Millennium Man kills Owen. The agents arrive at the scene and rescue Kevin. But the Millennium Man escapes.

The agents trace finger prints burned into Owen's neck to Simon Gates (the Millennium Man), who owns a recycling plant. Records indicate Gates visited Israel. Mulder speculates Gates may be suffering from the Jerusalem Syndrome, a condition that causes people to suffer religious delusions induced by the journey.

Susan Kryder and her son become stranded on a remote road after their car breaks down. Gates appears at the scene and chases after Kevin. Susan climbs into Gates' car and attempts to run him down. But she loses control of the vehicle and dies in a crash.

The agents take Kevin to a nearby motel and place him under surveillance. As Kevin is taking a bath, Scully tells Mulder how his disbelief towards religious miracles is difficult to fathom given his open-mindedness towards the paranormal. Suddenly, a loud noise erupts from the bathroom. When the agents enter, they find Kevin has been abducted through a window.

Scully notices a circular recycling logo on a trash bin. Suspecting she might be the person chosen by God to protect Kevin, she drives to Gates' recycling plant. Mulder, however, believes Gates will try to get out of town as quickly as possible, and heads for the airport. Scully's hunch proves correct; Gates throws himself into the blades of a gigantic recycling vat, taking Kevin with him. But the boy manages to cling to a safety platform. Scully pulls the boy to safety. The wounds on the boy's hands miraculously heal.

Dr. Jeff Eckerle, a renowned scientist, calls an exterminator to rid his basement of cockroaches. As the exterminator, Dr. Bugger, sets about his work in the basement of Eckerle's home, he suddenly grabs his throat, gasping for breath, and falls against a cement wall. Eckerle rushes to the basement, and looks on, horrified, as roaches swarm Dr. Bugger, engulfing his entire body.

Shortly thereafter, Mulder strikes up a conversation with Sheriff Frass, who relays the news about the roach attack. Intrigued, Mulder inspects the exterminator's corpse, and phones Scully for her opinion regarding the bizarre incident. Scully suspects the man was probably allergic to cockroaches and died from anaphylactic shock. Shortly thereafter, the sheriff receives a report about a teenager who mutilated his own body with a razor after he became convinced that roaches were burrowing into his body. Scully again supplies a logical explanation, attributing the incident to a psychotic disorder caused by the victim's drug use. Mulder searches the drug den and turns up a cockroach exoskeleton, which he believes is made out of metal.

Mulder takes the skin to a nearby hospital for examination. Meanwhile, hospital staff discover the dead body of Dr. Newton, who expired while using a toilet. An orderly describes how roaches completely covered Newton's corpse. Mulder again telephones Scully for advice. She attributes the death to an aneurysm caused by straining too forcefully.

Sheriff Frass tells Mulder the federal government erected a facility in town to conduct experiments on cockroaches. Mulder sneaks onto the property, where he encounters Dr. Bambi Berenbaum, a voluptuous entomologist. Berenbaum, a federal agent with the USDA Agricultural Research Service, explains that cockroaches are being studied to determine the best method to eradicate them. She agrees with Scully's theory about an accidental importation of a new cockroach species-a species which is attracted to, rather than repelled by, the sight of human beings.

Yet another body turns up at a nearby motel. Mulder finds one of the bugs trapped inside a roach motel, and brings it to Dr. Berenbaum for examination. The insect proves to be robotic, not organic. The discovery leads Mulder to Dr. Alexander Ivanov at the Massachusetts Institute of Robotics. He examines the robotic insect, but is stunned by its complexity. He suspects that, perhaps, the robot cockroaches were sent to explore Earth by an advanced alien race.

When Scully arrives in town, she finds the community in a state of panic. She phones Mulder with a theory about Dr. Eckerle, who witnessed the exterminator's death. Eckerle is an alternative fuel researcher, who manufactures methane gas from manure. Scully believes the new species of bugs, which are dung-eaters, may have accidentally hitched a ride along with the manure samples.

Mulder drives to Eckerle's lab, where the crazed doctor confronts the agent with a gun. Eckerle fires the weapon, missing Mulder but igniting methane gas. A huge explosion engulfs the research facility, killing Eckerle.

The agents travel to the city of Comity when the body of high school teenager "Boom" Deboom is found dangling from a rope. Police Detective Angela White explains that it's the third death of a high school boy in as many months. She suspects the fatalities may be linked to a satanic cult. Scully insists that the FBI's research has proved most accounts false or imagined. But during Deboom's funeral, the casket suddenly erupts into flames.

The agents interview two blonde teenaged girls, Terri Roberts and Margi Kleinjan, who were present on the night Deboom died. The girls give almost identical stories... one account corroborating the other. Shortly thereafter, the girls attend basketball practice at the high school gymnasium. One of the players, Eric, accidentally crashes into the girls, showering them with lemonade. The girls focus their powers on the ball, sending it bouncing beneath wooden, accordion-like bleacher seats. When Eric crawls beneath the bleachers, the electric motor suddenly engages, crushing him to death.

With each passing death, the townspeople's anger increases. So, too, does the tension between Mulder and Scully, who are unusually short with one another. Detective White visits Mulder at his motel room. The conversation shifts from the facts in the case, and Mulder and White find one another in each other's arms. But Scully interrupts their tryst with news of another death.

Mulder turns to Madame Zirinka, an astrologist, for help. Zirinka claims a rare planetary alignment, scheduled for January 12th, is affecting people's behavior. She also believes that those people born in 1979 will have all the energy of the cosmos focused on them.

Meanwhile, Margi makes sexual advances towards Scott Simmons inside his garage. But their private moment is spoiled when a jealous Terri interrupts. Margi and Terri engage in a bitter argument. When their telekinetic powers flair, a garage door spring suddenly and unexpectedly snaps in two, impaling and killing Scott. The girls turn to the police, and blame each other for the deaths that have plagued the town. But when they are brought to the police station, their anger towards one another wrecks havoc. Guns discharge, furniture moves, and everyone ducks for cover. Scully pushes Terri into an interrogation room where Margi is being held. She dead bolts the door, and watches, amazed, as the power within builds to a crescendo. But when the clock strikes midnight, the fury suddenly ends.

In Washington, D.C., an artist's model is brutally slashed to death after he finishes a session posing for a group of art students. The F.B.I. links one of the students, John Mostow, to the model's death, and to several other killings of young males over a three year period. Agents Patterson and Nemhauser arrest an unruly Mostow in his studio apartment. During the struggle, Mostow bites Nemhauser on the arm. Five days after the arrest, the body of another young male victim, bearing the same facial mutilation, is found six miles away.

Mulder and Scully interview Mostow in his jail cell. He claims he was possessed by a dark spirit, an entity that forced him to kill. Afterward, the agents meet with Patterson, who worked on solving the serial killings for three years. In private, Mulder tells Scully that he and Patterson have held a grudge ever since his days as a student at the bureau. Patterson was well-respected and even envied by many students, but Mulder failed to step in line. He didn't believe in Patterson's teachings that the only way to find a monster is to become one yourself.

The agents visit Mostow's studio, where they find sketch after sketch of gargoyles covering the room. Mostow believed the images protected him from the demon. Mulder and Scully discover more bodies-covered with clay-hidden within a secret room. Shortly thereafter, a man employed as a glassblower is viciously attacked by a figure armed with a carpet knife.

Mulder visits a library and reads literature pertaining to gargoyles. He then returns to Mostow's apartment, where he draws and sculpts images of the creatures. A dark figure emerges from the shadows. Mulder chases the figure to an industrial area. The creature attacks the agent, but during the struggle, Mulder falls from a gangway. The figure runs off into the darkness. Later, Mulder tells Scully that the creature exists. Scully is skeptical, and as she leaves the scene, she discovers broken pieces of a knife. The crime lab finds Mulder's finger print on the blade. Scully pays a visit to the F.B.I's evidence room, but Mostow's confiscated knife, seized by agents, is no where to be found.

Mulder returns to Mostow's studio, where he discovers Nemhauser's dead body encased in clay. When Patterson arrives at the studio, Mulder accuses him of killing Nemhauser and everyone else murdered since Mostow's incarceration. Mulder describes how Patterson became so obsessed with finding the killer, imaging everything the killer imagined, sinking himself so deeply into the case that finally, he became the very thing he so desperately sought to catch. Scully arrives at the studio, distracting Mulder. Patterson runs off and makes his way onto a rooftop. A struggle ensues, during which Patterson's face transforms into a hideous gargoyle. Mulder manages to grab his gun. He shoots Patterson, wounding him. Patterson is taken to jail.

@{fg shine}Piper Maru [#63]@{fg text}

A salvage vessel, the Piper Maru, sets anchor on the wind-scarred waters of the Pacific Ocean. The French-speaking crew lowers a diver, Gauthier, into the briny depths. Gauthier discovers the wreckage of a World War II fighter on the ocean floor, creating jubilation amongst his comrades. But as Gauthier peers into the glass canopy of the aircraft, he sees a living World War II pilot, his eyes covered with a thick black membrane, trapped inside. Certain he is hallucinating, Gauthier goes topside. But as the crew works to unsuit him, they fail to notice a black filmy membrane that now covers Gauthier's eyes.

Meanwhile, back in Washington, Skinner informs Scully that due of a lack of new leads or evidence, local police have made her sister's murder investigation inactive.

Afterward, Scully joins Mulder in his office. Mulder shows her evidence that the Piper Maru had been anchored in the exact location where the crew of the Talapus had performed scavenger work. He also reveals that everyone aboard the Piper Maru, except Gauthier, suffered acute radiation burns. The agents travel to a ship yard and examine the vessel. Mulder notices an oily film covering the diving suit. He and Scully find videotape footage of Gauthier's dive-and see the remains of the submerged World War II aircraft.

Gauthier, meanwhile, returns to San Francisco and begins ransacking a home office. His American wife, Joan, catches him in the act. Gauthier attacks Joan, and shortly thereafter, her eyes become covered by the same black film. Mulder finds Gauthier semi-conscious, on the kitchen floor. Gauthier only remembers events up to his discovery of the sunken aircraft, and nothing about the ransacked apartment. Mulder also finds a letter linking J. Kallenchuk Salvage Brokers to the mystery.

Scully tracks down an old neighbor and World War II vet, Commander Christopher Johansen, hoping he can shed some light on the sunken aircraft. As luck would have it, Johansen reveals he was aboard the submarine Zeus Faber during its mission to locate the plane-which had been transporting an atomic bomb during the war. He recounts how the sub crew took ill during the mission, and how he took over command when the Captain became irrational.

Mulder follows Geraldine Kallenchuk (who runs the salvage brokerage) to Hong Kong. He handcuffs himself to Geraldine and breaks into her office. Alex Krycek suddenly appears and gets the drop on Mulder. He forces Geraldine (still handcuffed to Mulder) into the hallway and dead bolts the door, separating the two. Gunshots suddenly ring out, and Geraldine is killed. Krycek escapes through a window. Mulder unlocks the handcuffs and he, too, flees the scene.

Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Skinner is shot in the stomach by the Hispanic Man (who, with Krycek, killed Scully's sister). Skinner is rushed to the hospital.

Mulder surprises Krycek at the Hong Kong airport. He punches him in the face, pulls a gun and demands the return of the digital tape. Krycek gives the agent a key, claiming the tape is kept inside a locker back in Washington. Mulder allows him to use a rest room so he can remove the blood from his face. But Joan Gauthier suddenly appears inside the men's room and attacks Krycek. The filmy black substance transfers from Gauthier to Krycek.

In flashback, government agents (among them a young William Mulder and The Cigarette-Smoking Man) visit the deathbed of a radiation-scarred crewman who served aboard the submarine Zeus Faber. The man insists the Navy tricked the submarine's crew into believing that their mission was to recover an atomic bomb from a sunken aircraft. But he believes the real purpose of the mission was to guard an alien entity living on the ocean floor-a life-form that invaded the sub and killed crewmen with deadly radiation. The Cigarette-Smoking Man assures the crewman that the government will make the truth public.

In present day Washington, Scully visits Skinner at a hospital. Skinner, semi-conscious, reveals that he recognized his assailant. Fearing further attacks, Scully assigns guards posted outside his hospital room.

Meanwhile, Mulder orders Krycek to drive him to the location where the digital tape is stored. During the journey, another vehicle deliberately slams into Mulder's car, forcing it off the road. Mulder is injured in the crash and loses consciousness. Armed men confront Krycek and demand the tape. Moments later, a blinding white light emanates from Krycek's body and strobes the armed men.

Scully visits Mulder at the hospital where he's recuperating from injuries suffered in the car crash. Scully produces lab tests that prove Skinner's assailant and her sister's killer are one and the same. Later, the agents examine the diver's suit Gauthier wore during the salvage mission. Mulder points out a layer of diesel oil covering the suit. He believes the oil is a medium used by an extraterrestrial to jump from host to host. Krycek, Mulder postulates, is the alien's latest host.

With the aid of the Lone Gunmen, Mulder recovers a package believed to contain the digital tape. The tape case inside the package is empty, but faint pen strokes on the outside of the paper package reveal the Well-Manicured Man's phone number. Mulder arranges a face-to-face meeting in hopes of learning Krycek's location. Krycek, meanwhile, gives the tape to the Cigarette-Smoking Man.

During their meeting, the Well-Manicured Man tells Mulder a UFO was downed by American pilots over the Pacific Ocean during the second World War. Missions to salvage the craft failed because of intense radiation. Mulder realizes that the Well-Manicured Man doesn't know where Krycek is.

Meanwhile, Scully guards Skinner as he is transported to another hospital. The Hispanic Man, Luis Cardinal, attempts to gain access to the ambulance. But Scully surprises him and a chase ensues. Cardinal is struck by an automobile and falls into an alleyway. Terrified Scully will shoot him, he reveals that Krycek is headed for an abandoned missile site outside Bismarck, North Dakota.

The agents gain access to the site, but the Cigarette-Smoking Man has them taken into custody before they can search all the silos. Later, we see Krycek inside a silo where an alien spacecraft is hidden. The entity exits Krycek's body, leaving him entombed within the silo.

Later, Mulder tells Scully that Luis Cardinal was found dead inside his jail cell-a death made to look like a suicide.

@{fg shine}Pusher [#65]@{fg text}

At a grocery market in Virginia, Agent Frank Burst and a phalanx of sheriff's deputies arrest a man known only as Pusher. Pusher is shackled in leg irons and seated in the back of a cruiser, a heavy steel screen separating him from Burst and a deputy (who's at the wheel). As the deputy waits his turn to pull onto a busy highway, Pusher uses the sound of his voice to take control of the deputy's mind. Against his will, the deputy drives the cruiser directly into the path of an oncoming truck, and an enormous collision ensues.

Burst survives the impact, but the sheriff's deputy is killed and Pusher escapes. Burst approaches Mulder and Scully for help with the bizarre case. He describes how, a month earlier, Pusher called him and confessed to a string of contract killings going back two years. The murders Pusher confessed to had all been ruled suicides by the coroner's office. But he possessed intimate details known only to police. Burst believes Pusher was bragging when he confessed to the crimes, as if he was playing a twisted game. Most disturbing is how Pusher somehow willed the sheriff's deputy to unlock his shackles.

A clue finger-written on the wrecked police cruiser leads the agents to back issues of a magazine called "American Ronin" (a ronin is a samurai warrior without a master). After leafing through several issues, the agents find "hit for hire" ads they suspect were placed by Pusher. They trace a telephone number listed in the ad to a pay phone, which, in turn, leads them to a driving range where Pusher works. Heavily-armed federal agents surround the range. Pusher takes refuge inside a shed and is cornered by an agent. He wills the agent to pour gasoline over his own body and set himself on fire. Scully extinguishes the flames, and Pusher is taken into custody. But during a preliminary court hearing, Pusher (whose real name is Robert Modell) clouds the mind of the presiding judge and is released.

Using his mental powers, Modell slips by FBI security and gains access to the agency's computer records. Skinner spots the intruder and attempts to intercede. But Modell overpowers an office cleric's mind and wills her to spray mace in Skinner's eyes. During the confusion, Modell escapes with the records.

Skinner recovers, and later informs the agents that Modell fled with Mulder's computer file. Burst, Mulder, Scully and a team of SWAT officers storm Modell's apartment, but find it empty. What they do find is epilepsy medication. Scully theorizes that if a brain tumor triggered Modell's powers, he might be dying... and committing murders as one last big "hurrah." Modell phones the agents as they are sifting through his apartment. As Burst tries to keep him on the line until the call can be traced, Modell wills him to suffer a fatal heart attack.

The FBI tracks Modell to a nearby hospital. Mulder fears that Modell might focus his powers on one of the armed agents, so he enters the building alone, unarmed and wired with high-tech video gear that allows Scully and the other agents to see what he sees.

As Mulder walks through the building, shots ring out. He finds the dead bodies of an MRI technician and a security guard. He also finds a medical chart which confirms the tumor is fatal. Modell clouds Mulder's mind and forces him to play Russian roulette, first on himself, and then on Scully. Scully trips a fire alarm after realizing that Modell must concentrate all of his energy for his powers to work. This distracts Modell long enough for agents to rush him. Later, we see Modell in a hospital bed, weak and near death.

@{fg shine}Teso Dos Bichos [#66]@{fg text}

At the Teso Dos Bichos excavation site in South America, Secona Indian diggers uncover an Amaru urn embedded in the wall of a burial mound. The urn contains the remains of a female shaman, which the Indians believe is sacred to their tribe. Bilac, a Brazilian-born man acting as dig coordinator, tells Dr. Roosevelt, the American leader of the expedition, that the urn should be left undisturbed. But Roosevelt insists it be transported back to the United States. Later, Bilac participates in an Indian tribal ceremony and consumes a strange liquid called yaje. Moments later, a jaguar-like form attacks Roosevelt inside his tent, killing him.

At the Museum of Natural History in Boston, a night watchman discovers the body of Mr. Horning, who participated in the archeological project. Dr. Lewton, the museum's coordinator, suspects that the murder may be an act of political terrorism. Mulder tells Scully that the Secona Indians believe great evil will befall anyone who disturbs the remains of an Amaru, a woman-shaman.

The agents question Bilac, who admits he objected to the dig from the very beginning. Scully believes it was Bilac who murdered Horning, and not a mythological Jaguar spirit sent by the Seconas. Later, Dr. Lewton is attacked by an unseen force as he works under the hood of his stalled Jaguar automobile.

The agents search the area around the museum hoping for clues. Scully finds body parts of dead rats wedged inside the engine. She suspects the animals were attracted by the car engine's warmth. While searching nearby woods, Mulder discovers Lewton's eviscerated remains dangling from a tree.

Mona Wustner, a grad student researcher, phones the agents with news that Bilac made frightening comments to her. Inside the woman's washroom at the museum, Mona discovers rats trapped within a toilet. But when Mulder arrives at the museum, Mona has disappeared.

Scully, meanwhile, gains access to Bilac's residence. She finds the liquid yaje inside a ceremonial bowl, and reads journal entries indicating that Bilac has invoked the Amaru curse.

Mulder discovers Bilac inside the woman's washroom at the museum. He claims Mona is dead, but insists he does not know where to find the body. Bilac is placed in a room guarded by security men.

The agents find the dead body of Mona's dog, Sugar. A veterinarian performs an autopsy and discovers evidence that the dog had eaten a cat which had devoured a poisoned rat. Mulder concludes the rats are trying to get away from something.

Bilac disappears. The agents suspect he escaped into steam tunnels that run beneath the museum. Pulling up a manhole cover, the agents descend into the darkness. They discover Dr. Lewton's partially-devoured body parts... and dozens of ravenous house cats. Mulder rescues Scully after she is attacked by a cat. But the felines give chase, and the agents take refuge inside a room. As a sea of cats mass for another attack, the agents discover Bilac's body stuck inside an air vent. Realizing the vent is their only means of escape, Mulder and Scully dislodge the body and make their way to safety. Animal control is dispatched to hunt down the rampaging felines, but cannot locate them in the miles of steam tunnels. Mulder receives word that the State Department is returning the urn to Ecuador.

@{fg shine}Hell Money [#67]@{fg text}

The agents travel to San Francisco's Chinatown district after a night watchman at a crematorium discovered a man being burned alive inside an oven. Mulder discovers a Chinese character scrawled inside the oven door, along with a wad of currency. Glen Chao, a detective of Asian descent, identifies the writing as the Chinese word for "ghost." He also explains that the currency is called "hell money," which is used as an offering to spirits during the Chinese Festival of the Hungry Ghosts. The threesome learn that the victim's name is Johnny Lo. They search Lo's apartment and discover blood stains beneath a newly installed wall-to-wall carpet.

Meanwhile, an Asian man, Hsin, temporarily leaves his daughter, Kim, so he can attend a mysterious meeting. At an abandoned restaurant, Hsin participates in a strange game in which players draw colored tiles from jade vases. A Wiry Man draws a tile that elicits great excitement from the crowd-and a sense of relief from Hsin. The Wiry Man is escorted to a back room, where he is drugged. Shortly thereafter, the agents discover his body in a cemetery.

Scully's autopsy on the Wiry Man's corpse reveals evidence that the man's body organs had been harvested. The agents confront Chao about their discovery, but they sense he is being protective about the goings-on within the Chinese community. But Chao does provide the name of the man who installed the carpet in Johnny Lo's apartment: Hsin.

Mulder, Scully and Chao pay a visit to Hsin's apartment. Hsin's eye is heavily bandaged, which he claims is a work-related injury. As Chao and Hsin carry on a conversation in Chinese, Mulder discovers one of the colored game tiles. After the threesome leave the apartment, Hsin tells his daughter they need money for her leukemia treatments. But Kim blames her father's eye injury on the mysterious meetings. Moved by his daughter's concern, Hsin tells the head-gamesman, a Hard-Faced Man, that he no longer wishes to participate. But the Hard-Faced Man insists Hsin is close to winning a jackpot worth two million dollars.

Meanwhile, Chao is attacked by what appear to be masked demons. But when Mulder visits the hospital, Chao is not to be found. By checking a hospital chart, the agents realize Chao's blood type matches the blood found on the carpet padding at Johnny Lo's apartment. Mulder suspects Chao is somehow involved.

The agents return to Hsin's apartment, where they question Kim. She explains that the family has no medical insurance, and that the cost of leukemia treatments is very high. Mulder realizes Hsin is participating in some sort of game. The agents pay a visit to an organ procurement organization, where they are told that a number of Asian men request typing and antigen work-ups, only to disappear.

The agents trace a phone number supplied by the organization to an abandoned restaurant. Inside the kitchen, the agent's discover human organs being stored in freezers. Unbeknownst to them, another game is underway in a room over the restaurant. Hsin loses and is dragged to the back room. Chao, no longer willing to help cover up the activity, interrupts the game and smashes one of the jade vases-revealing tiles of all the same color within. The participants realize that the game is rigged, and a melee breaks out.

The agents hear the commotion and race upstairs. They find Chao holding the Hard-Faced Man-about to remove one of Hsin's organs-at gun point. Hsin is rescued and his daughter is placed on a recipient list at the organ procurement organization.

@{fg shine}Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space' [#68]@{fg text}

Scully meets with Jose Chung, a famous author researching a book about an alleged UFO encounter in Klass County, Washington. Scully recounts how a teenaged girl, Chrissy Giorgio, was found inside her boyfriend's car on a deserted country road. Chrissy exhibited signs of physical abuse. Scully theorizes she may have been a victim of date rape.

Chrissy's boyfriend, Harold Lamb, was questioned by Detective Manners. Lamb claimed that he and Chrissy were abducted by aliens. Lamb passed a lie detector test, but when Mulder and Scully arrived at the scene, he changed his story and claimed he raped Chrissy.

Unsatisified with Lamb's account, Mulder asked Chrissy if she experienced any unusual symptoms-such as vision problems and nose bleeds-after the encounter allegedly took place. She claimed she saw sudden flashes of an alien's face. Mulder became convinced the girl was suffering from "Post Abduction Syndrome." Scully, meanwhile, attributed her ailments to stress disorder triggered by sexual trauma.

Under hypnosis, Chrissy described how she and her boyfriend were examined by aliens aboard a spaceship-confirming Lamb's original alibi.

Later, the agents interviewed Roky Crikenson, an electric company employee who allegedly witnessed the abduction and recorded his observations in a manuscript. Roky described how strange men wearing black clothing visited his home the previous evening and warned him not to divulge his story.

Mulder read Roky's manuscript and concluded it verified Lamb's account of what occurred on the night of the alleged abduction. But Mulder was puzzled by Chrissy's story, which did not match Roky's or Lamb's versions.

Chrissy was again placed under hypnosis. During the second session, she described how she was interrogated by men from the Air Force and CIA. This led Mulder to speculate that the case might not have anything to do with aliens after all.

The agents were alerted about the discovery of a dead alien. But during an autopsy examination, Scully discovered the alien was, in fact, a dead man wearing a costume. A check of military records revealed the deceased was Air Force Major Robert Vallee.

When Vallee's body disappeared, Mulder tracked down Blaine Faulkner, who videotaped Scully's "autopsy." But the mysterious "men in black" beat the agent to Faulkner's doorstep and took possession of the tape. After leaving Faulkner's apartment, Mulder encountered a naked man walking along a country road. He realized the man was Lieutenant Jack Sheaffer, a missing military officer. Sheaffer admitted that he piloted a fake UFO-type craft developed by the military to confuse potential invading forces. But Sheaffer was convinced that he, Vallee, and the two teenagers were actually abducted by a real UFO.

Mulder then returned to his motel room, where he later claimed to have encountered the "men in black," and a man who strongly resembled game show host Alex Trebek.

The agents were informed that a top secret government plane crashed in a forest nearby. Detective Manners claimed that the UFO sightings could be attributed to the strange craft-until Vallee's body is pulled from the wreckage.

In the present day, Mulder approaches Chung and asks him not to write the book. He fears any account of the events will only make the participants look foolish. Chung denies his request.

Attorney Jay Cassal finalizes Skinner's divorce petition. Skinner, however, decides to wait one more day before signing the document.

While relaxing at the Chesapeake Lounge at the Ambassador Hotel, Skinner is approached by an attractive woman. The pair strike up a conversation, and their apparent mutual attraction and loneliness quickly escalates to lovemaking in a hotel room. During their passion, Skinner sees the woman change from an attractive lover to an old woman. Skinner suddenly awakens. When he turns to the woman from the bar, he discovers her lifeless corpse.

Scully and Mulder join Homicide Detective Waltos at the crime scene, where they learn details about the murder and Skinner's possible involvement. The victim is identified as Carina Sayles, a former legal secretary who moonlighted for an escort service. The agents interview Lorraine Kelleher, who runs the escort service. Kelleher states that Sayles called her from the bar and used Skinner's credit card number to pay for the "transaction."

Scully tells Mulder neither of them really knows very much about Skinner's personal life. Later, the agents meet with their boss after he is released from jail. But he is uncooperative, and refuses to comment about the incident, or explain why he refused a polygraph test. During their conversation, it dawns on Mulder that Skinner did not know that Sayles was a prostitute.

Scully shows Mulder a videotape containing footage of people who suffer from REM sleep behavior disorder. The affliction causes sufferers to grow violent during sleep, perhaps explaining the murder. Scully learns from Skinner's psychiatrist that he had been experiencing a recurring dream in which he is confronted by an old woman. Mulder links the description to a succubus, a spirit that visits men during the night in just such a form.

Skinner's wife, Sharon, pays a visit to Skinner's apartment. Later, police discover that Sharon was involved in an automobile accident-and evidence that someone ran her off the road. All evidence points to Skinner. Later, Skinner tells Mulder he first encountered visions of the old woman during a near-death experience in Vietnam.

Mulder searches Skinner's damaged car for clues. He cuts away the automobile's exploded air bag from the steering wheel and has it analyzed. The FBI crime lab constructs a computerized image of a facial imprint embedded in the air bag. It belongs to someone other than Skinner. Mulder suspects that someone within the government is trying to destroy Skinner (having failed in their attempts to kill him in a previous episode).

A hearing is established to investigate the facts in the case. Skinner's accusers use Scully's testimony about the X-Files to dismiss him from the Bureau. Later, the agents discover that Kelleher fell from her condo high-rise. They question her assistant, Judy, who identifies the computer image of the man who stole Skinner's car as the same man who hired Sayles to approach Skinner. The agents arrange for Judy to meet the suspect at the Ambassador.

Skinner visits his ailing wife at the hospital. There, he again sees the image of the old woman, who beckons to him from his wife's bed. Skinner moves closer, only to see Sharon's form. Sharon whispers something in Skinner's ear.

The man who's image was reconstructed from the air bag surprises Judy and Scully in their hotel room. Mulder and Detective Waltos rush to their aid, but Skinner mysteriously appears and guns down the assailant. When Scully asks Skinner as to how he knew the assailant's whereabouts, he cryptically declines to answer.

Dr. Paul Farraday, a biologist, and Dr. William Bailey, a member of the U.S. Forestry Service, debate the cause of a rapid decline in the frog population at Heuvelmans Lake in Georgia. Shortly thereafter, while walking near the lake's shore, Bailey is attacked and killed by an unseen force.

Mulder and Scully drive to the lake after Bailey becomes the second person reported missing from the area in the same week (Scully brings her dog, Queequeg, along for the ride). Mulder suspects the disappearances are linked to Big Blue, a legendary, Loch Ness-like monster that allegedly lives in the murky water.

It becomes apparent that the creature's supposed existence is responsible for most of Lake Heuvelmans' tourism business. While speaking with Ted Bertram, owner of a local tackle shop, the agents encounter Ansel Bray, a Big Blue expert who has devoted his life to photographing the elusive behemoth. The conversation is interrupted when a local fisherman barges into the shop with news that he discovered a body floating in the lake.

The body is identified as Scott Woosley, a Boy Scout leader who disappeared after he wander from his troop to relieve himself. Scully notes that Woosley's fly is open, a common identifier of drowning victims who consumed too much alcohol and fell into the water while urinating. But Mulder believes the creature is responsible for the death.

The agents interview Farraday, who quite openly scoffs at the notion of the existence of Big Blue. Shortly thereafter, Ted Bertram is killed by the unseen creature.

Aided by Sheriff Lance Hindt, the agents search the area where Bertram disappeared. They inspect giant three-toed footprints imbedded in the muck on the lake's shore. But the evidence is dismissed when a "dinosaur boot" is uncovered near the scene.

The body count increases after a teenaged diver is killed. Based on a preliminary examination, Scully attributes the death to a motor boat propeller. Not long afterward, Ansel is also attacked and killed.

Mulder begs the Sheriff to close down the lake before anyone else is attacked. Hindt refuses, citing a lack of manpower. But as Hindt is dragging the lake for bodies, something grabs hold of his line and yanks him into the water. Immediately, he orders the lake closed.

Scully gives chase when Queequeg suddenly darts off into the woods near the lake. She discovers the tattered remains of a leather dog collar.

The agents rent a boat, and using a depth finder, embark on a nighttime hunt for the elusive creature. Something tears a hole in the boat's hull, causing the vessel to sink. Surrounded by darkness, the pair take refuge on a tiny rock island. But Farraday emerges from the darkness and informs the agents the shore is only a stone's throw from their island. Embarrassed, Mulder and Scully walk to shore.

Mulder takes interest in Farraday's bag full of frogs. He realizes that the monster's sudden attack on humans was provoked by a change in the lake's ecosystem. Farraday becomes the creature's next victim, but he escapes with a flesh wound. Mulder tracks the elusive culprit through a marsh area, firing several rounds from his pistol. What he encounters, however, is a monstrous alligator, now bleeding from gunshot wounds.

But somewhere in the lake, a serpentine form undulates in the murky, moonlit water.

A mysterious Plain-Clothed Man alerts Mulder to a pair of multiple-homicides in which the killers suddenly became delusional. Mulder is unsure who the informant is working for, but he nonetheless follows up on the tip. He and Scully visit a psychiatric hospital, where Joseph Patnick, one of the mass murderers, suddenly goes berserk while watching television. The agents meet with Dr. Stroman, who theorizes his patient might be suffering from a delusional syndrome.

The agents search Patnick's home looking for clues. While combing the house, Mulder and Scully locate row upon row of video cassette tapes containing cable news broadcasts. Back at the motel, Mulder views hours of the news footage but is unable to formulate a link between the broadcasts and the murders. Scully, however, cites recent studies linking television violence to violent behavior. Mulder dismisses the connection.

Out of curiosity, Scully views the rest of the video tapes. Late that night, she sees Mulder and The Cigarette-Smoking Man meeting in secret in a car parked outside the motel. The next day, the agents receive word regarding yet another strange murder. This time, a housewife suddenly beat a neighbor to death. The killer, Mrs. Riddock, told authorities that her husband was having an affair with a blonde woman in a hammock in their backyard. In reality, Mrs. Riddock attacked and killed her next door neighbor, who was resting in a hammock with a Golden Retriever. The agents search Riddock's home and uncover a large pile of VHS cassette tapes. Mulder spots a cable technician working on a utility pole nearby. When the technician drive off, Mulder climbs the pole and removes a video trap device. He brings it to the Lone Gunmen for analysis.

Meanwhile, Scully grows more and more suspicious about Mulder's activities. While speaking with Scully over the telephone, Mulder notices her paranoia and drives back to the motel. Believing she is being attacked by unknown intruders, Scully opens fire, narrowly missing her partner. She then runs off.

The Lone Gunman confirm Mulder's theory that the device somehow induces violent behavior. Using different colors, it acts as a sort of mind control. Mulder, who is red-green color blind, realizes why he was not affected.

Mulder receives word that Scully's body may have been located. Before he reaches the morgue, the Plain-Clothed Man warns him to concentrate on finding the parties responsible before they destroy evidence. Mulder ignores the warning and goes to the morgue. The victim, however, is not Scully.

Mulder travels to Mrs. Scully's house. Scully suddenly steps into view, leveling a pistol at Mulder's head. Delusional, she claims that Mulder has been lying to her from their very first assignment. But Mrs. Scully convinces her distraught daughter to drop the weapon.

Mulder realizes that Dr. Stroman's treatment of Patnick was unorthodox. He tracks Stroman and the cable technician to a house on the outskirts of town. Suddenly, gunshots rings out. When Mulder enters the home, he finds X standing over the bodies. X blames the deaths on Mulder. But Mulder counters he never knew who the Plain-Clothed Man was working for.

Later, Mulder and the now-recovered Scully meet with Skinner. But Mulder does not identify X as the man who killed Stroman and the cable technician.

At a busy fast food restaurant in Arlington, Virginia, a distraught man, Galen, suddenly pulls out a gun and begins shooting at customers. A police sharpshooter returns fire, severely wounding him. A Gentle-Looking Man steps from the crowd and places his open palm on Galen's wound, miraculously healing it in a matter of moments. When Scully and Mulder arrive at the scene, paramedics and detectives are unable to describe the incident in a coherent fashion, as all of the customers who were struck by gunfire are now uninjured. Even more puzzling, the Gentle-Looking Man disappeared from the scene without a trace.

Meanwhile, at the Mulder's beach front summer home in Rhode Island, Mrs. Mulder is approached by The Cigarette-Smoking Man. They become embroiled in a heated argument. Shortly thereafter, Mulder receives word that his mother was rushed to an emergency room in serious condition. Accompanied by Scully, Mulder races to the hospital. From her bed, Mrs. Mulder asks her son for a pen. She then writes the word "palm" on a sheet of note paper.

The agents return to Washington, where they view unedited videotape footage of the fast food restaurant shooting. Analyzing the footage frame by frame, the agents watch in astonishment as the Gentle-Looking Man seemingly morphs into another man.

Shortly thereafter, a group of agents, headed by The Cigarette-Smoking Man, corner and arrest the Gentle-Looking Man at a Social Security Office where he is employed. Almost simultaneously, Scully stops a person who looks exactly like the Gentle-Looking Man at FBI headquarters. The man, Jeremiah Smith, claims he is about to turn himself in. Smith is questioned by Skinner and released.

Back at the summer house, X shows Mulder photographs of his mother and The Cigarette-Smoking Man having an argument. Mulder claims he does not know what the discussion was about. Mulder leaves the house, then doubles back under the cover of darkness. Using a pen, he rearranges the letters of the word "palm" to spell "lamp." He then smashes a ceramic lamp against a wall and uncovers a stiletto weapon (the same device the Bounty Hunter used to kill alien colonists in previous episodes).

The first Jeremiah Smith (arrested at the Social Security Offices) is thrown in prison and interrogated by The Cigarette-Smoking Man. During the interrogation, Smith transforms into Deep Throat and Mr. Mulder, (both of whom The Cigarette-Smoking Man had killed). The Cigarette-Smoking Man tries to hide his astonishment. During the conversation, Smith tells the Smoking Man he is dying of lung cancer.

Meanwhile, Mulder tracks the second Smith to the Social Security Offices. But Smith suddenly breaks away and disappears into a crowd. Back at the prison, the Bounty Hunter, stiletto in hand, enters Jeremiah's cell. But it is empty.

At the hospital, doctors tell Mulder that his mother's condition is worse than previously thought. Mulder is approached by The Cigarette-Smoking Man. He claims to have information pertaining to the whereabouts of Mulder's sister. Mulder counters that he possesses what the Smoking Man is looking for.

One of the Jeremiah Smiths arrives at Scully's apartment unannounced. Scully drives him to a secluded location and rendezvous with Mulder. Suddenly, the Bounty Hunter arrives at the scene, stiletto in hand.

Mulder and Scully desperately try to protect the life of Jeremiah Smith. Not only is this mysterious man a link to the colonization plan - his paranormal healing powers are Mulder's only hope of saving his mother's life. Close on their trail is the relentless alien bounty hunter: an assassin who is hard to escape. And harder to kill.

With the assassin close behind, Smith leads Mulder to an eerie, isolated farm community. There, Mulder is stunned to see clones of his sister Samantha, who had been abducted by aliens as a child. Smith tells Mulder that these children have been bred as worker drones. Before Smith can reveal more about the "Colonization" conspiracy, they are set upon by the alien assassin. Mulder is helpless to save Smith or Samantha.

Back in Washington, Scully's investigations into Smith's background lead her to a disquieting conclusion. All five of the identical men named Jeremiah Smith were secretly cataloguing the entire human population. But at whose orders? And why?

Meanwhile, the Cigarette-Smoking Man and the Elder have identified X as a traitor. He is ambushed and gunned down. As he dies, he leaves behind one last ambiguous clue: the letters "SRSG" scrawled in blood.

With his mother still in a coma, a despondent Mulder follows the last of his meager clues to the end of the line: the United Nations office of Special Representative to the Secretary General. An enigmatic official denies the Colony ever existed...as she hands him a folder containing photographs of the farm and of Samantha.

And finally, because "the fiercest enemy is the man who has nothing left to lose," the Cigarette-Smoking Man directs the Alien Bounty Hunter to heal Mulder's mother.

Home, Pennsylvania.

An idyllic small town is the last place anyone would expect to find a hideously malformed newborn buried in a shallow grave. This gruesome discovery is enough for the local sheriff, Andy Taylor, to call in the FBI. Although the child's deformations indicate multiple genetic abnormalities, neither Mulder nor Scully believe this local tragedy is a matter for the X-Files: until they learn more about Home's reclusive Peacock clan.

For over a century, this farm family has lived on the outskirts of town...and the outskirts of civilization. Generations of inbreeding have deformed their bodies and their souls into something less than human, and more than animal. Now that the family has dwindled down to three brothers, Mulder and Scully suspect that the Peacocks have devised a grotesque plan to propagate their species...by forcing a kidnapped woman into involuntary pregnancy.

While someone (or something) watches unseen, Mulder and Scully explore the Peacock farm and find the bloody evidence of a recent birth. Before they can arrest the Peacocks, the family strikes back. Later that night, the Peacock boys massacre the sheriff and his wife. As Mulder says, "They went caveman."

Fearing for the life of the Peacocks' prisoner, Scully and Mulder courageously invade the farmhouse with only the local deputy as back-up. When they discover the hiding place of the clan matriarch, they finally comprehend the appalling truth. Mrs. Peacock, a multiple amputee, is the mother of the murdered infant. And also the proud mother of three sons who'll do anything for mom.

With guile, luck, and firepower, Mulder and Scully manage to kill two of the rampaging Peacocks. In the confusion, the oldest boy and Mrs. Peacock escape in their long white Cadillac. Mother and son drive off in search of a new place to call Home.

@{fg shine}Teliko [#75]@{fg text}

Four African-American men have vanished off the streets of Philadelphia. An FBI/Police task force has come up with no leads...until the body of the most recent victim is discovered. Surprisingly, violence isn't the cause of death. The body's bizarre lack of pigmentation hints at some unknown ailment. The Centers for Disease Control calls in Scully to unravel the medical mystery.

Mulder, however, believes that more than a simple pathogen is involved. His investigations lead to a cover-up of a similar death on a flight from West Africa, and the presence of a toxic plant native to that area. Meanwhile, Scully discovers that the victim's pituitary gland -- which produces melanin among other hormones--has somehow been destroyed.

While their investigation is under way, the killer strikes again. This time a young black student is stalked and kidnapped from a bus stop. The evidence leads Scully and Mulder to a recent West African immigrant, Samuel Aboah. They arrest him when he attempts to escape. Hospital tests reveal that, among other peculiar abnormalities, Aboah lacks a pituitary gland.

A tip from his UN informant sends Mulder to Minister Diabira, a diplomat from the West African country of Burkina Faso. Reluctantly, Diabria admits he had ordered the cover-up of the first murder -- because he knew the identity of the killer. It was one of the mythical Teliko: evil spirits of the air, who emerge at night to suck the life and color out of their victims. Who would have believed that a terrifying West African folktale could come to life in 20th century America? No one... except Mulder.

Mulder explains his theory to a skeptical Scully: the Teliko are not ghostly entities, but members of a lost African clan, who have survived over generations by hunting down other humans to steal what they lack: hormones from the pituitary gland. Aboah escapes the hospital. In the ensuing manhunt, Aboah captures Mulder. Scully comes to Mulder's aid and shoots Aboah just in time to save Mulder's life. And the truth about the Teliko is destined to die along with him.

Northern Michigan.

A young woman is kidnapped and her boyfriend murdered. Her passport photographs, taken only moments earlier, don't show the expected smiling portraits. Instead, they display nightmarish images of the terrified girl.

The photographs fascinate Mulder. Scully tries to find a logical explanation: the pictures were planted, or the film is damaged. But to Mulder, they are an example of "psychic photography": the paranormal ability to create images on film with the mind. Mulder theorizes that the suspect doesn't even know he possesses this gift... and that the photographs reveal the killer's darkest fantasies.

The kidnap victim is found: alive, but almost brain-dead. Her abductor had given her a primitive, botched lobotomy with an ice pick inserted through her eyes. Her mind almost gone, she endlessly repeats the word "unruhe.": the German word for "trouble" or "unrest." Soon, the kidnapper abducts and kills again.

Scully realizes that the same construction company had job sites near each crime scene. While Mulder is in Washington to examine the photos at the FBI labs, Scully follows up on her lead. She knows foreman Gerry Schnauz is the kidnapper by his terrified reaction to the word "unruhe." She arrests him.

Schnauz is a formerly institutionalized paranoid schizophrenic with a history of violence. When confronted by the photographs of his victims, he's startled at the sight of his own paranoid delusions brought to life on film. Admitting the crime, he tells them where to find his other victim. She too has been lobotomized.

Schnauz kills a guard and escapes from jail. He returns to the scene of the first crime to steal the camera and film. Mulder's blood runs cold when he sees exposed photographs of Schnauz's next victim: Scully! Now, Mulder's only hope of saving her is studying the photos to get deep inside Schnauz's mind.

In captivity, Scully, too, must use everything she knows about Schnauz to keep herself alive. But she can't talk him out of his delusions. It won't be long before he wields the icepick to rid Scully of the "unruhe" he believes is tormenting her.

Mulder's insight into the madman's mind leads him to Schnauz's dark den. With hardly a moment to spare, he shoots Scully's kidnapper. And finds one last series of psychic photographs: Schnauz -- shot dead on the floor.

@{fg shine}The Field Where I Died [#77]@{fg text}

Apison, Tennessee, once the site of a Civil War battle, is now the home of the Temple of the Seven Stars, a doomsday religious cult that believes in reincarnation. A member named "Sidney" calls the FBI with accusations of child abuse and weapons stockpiling. Fearing another Waco or Jonestown, the BATF and the FBI lead a joint raid on the compound. No weapons are found. Neither is Vernon Ephesian, the cult's dangerously charismatic leader, who dominates his followers with a mix of Biblical prophecy, New Age channeling and old-fashioned intimidation.

An odd compulsion leads Mulder to search a nearby field where he finds an underground Civil War bunker concealing Ephesian and his six wives--all on the verge of committing mass suicide. One of the wives, Melissa, catches Mulder's attention. She feels somehow familiar to him. Ephesian, his wives and the cultists are taken into custody. But with no evidence of abuse or illegal weapons, the FBI can hold them for only one day. Mulder and Scully are assigned to interrogate Ephesian and his wives. Preaching fire and brimstone, Ephesian admits nothing.

Melissa is a different story. Under questioning, this withdrawn and hostile girl suddenly shifts personalities into the mysterious informant Sidney, a gruff male New Yorker. But somehow Mulder knows Melissa's case is even more unusual than Multiple Personality Disorder. He is certain that "Sidney" is one of Melissa's past lives. Scully, who has a hard enough time with MPD let alone reincarnation, can't understand why Mulder is so obsessed with Melissa, and so certain he is right.

Then comes a revelation that surprises even Mulder. Melissa shifts into yet another identity: a Civil War nurse named Sarah Kavanaugh. She tells them she watched as her fiancee Sullivan Biddle died in the aftermath of the long-ago battle. And that Biddle is one of Mulder's past lives. Mulder unconditionally believes her. Desperate to discover the truth...Mulder has himself regressed.

Scully listens as Mulder cycles through a series of his past lives. He says that same souls reincarnate together over and over again: he, Samantha, Scully, even the Cigarette-Smoking Man are destined to play out many lifetimes together. Melissa and Mulder are soulmates... fated always to be star-crossed lovers.

The current Melissa hears Mulder's story, but she won't allow herself to believe. She returns to Ephesian. Scully doesn't know what to think -- especially when she discovers photographs of Sarah and Sullivan in historical archives.

After Ephesian and his cultists are released, everyone's worst fears come true. Ephesian leads the cult in a mass suicide. Mulder discovers the body of Melissa... clutching the photograph of Sarah Kavanaugh in her hand.

@{fg shine}Sanguinarium [#78]@{fg text}

Everyone wants to be beautiful. And the Aesthetic Surgery Unit of Chicago's Greenwood Memorial Hospital can make anyone more attractive...for a price. For one patient thought to be undergoing a scalp-reduction the price is a grisly death, when Dr. Lloyd goes insane during surgery and performs a violent liposuction instead...and literally sucks the life blood out of the man.

Scully and Mulder are called in to investigate the doctor's unusual defense: demonic possession. Scully logically assumes the doctor's sleeping pill addiction caused a psychotic break. When Mulder discovers evidence of a pentagram--an occult symbol of protection-- on the floor of the operating room, he concludes that some kind of magic is at work. Scully is dubious, to put it mildly. Another surgeon goes into an uncontrollable frenzy, using a laser to burn through the flesh of a patient's face . Mulder discovers the mark of the pentagram on this body as well -- placed there by Nurse Waite, a practicing witch.

Dr. Franklyn admits that Nurse Waite worked at the clinic ten years earlier when similar deaths had occurred. Scully and Mulder search her house, finding a spooky den of candles, incense, herbs and witchy objects. But Nurse Waite is gone. She's lying in wait for Dr. Franklin; submerged in a tub full of gore in his bathroom. Her sneak knife attack fails, and she's arrested.

Before Nurse Waite can explain herself to Mulder, she dies horribly, in what Mulder recognizes from Nurse Waite's occult books as a classic case of death by hex.

Waite was trying to protect the patients...but against what or whom? Maybe Dr. Franklyn -- who smiles inscrutably as he levitates a few feet above his bed.

Putting all the clues together, Mulder deduces that Franklyn is a black magician. Cursed with the sin of vanity, Franklyn transforms his looks beyond the limits of surgery: using sorcery and human sacrifice. Ten years ago, he had escaped suspicion. Today, he manages to escape even Mulder. Mulder is too late to stop the final sacrifice that completes the spell. Dr. Franklyn slices off his own face, to disappear forever...

... And the classically handsome Dr. Hartman is welcomed aboard at a Los Angeles cosmetic surgery clinic.

@{fg shine}Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man [#79]@{fg text}

In the Lone Gunmen's office, Scully and Mulder listen, as Frohike reveals what he suspects to be the chilling, secret past of The Cigarette- Smoking Man. Hiding in a nearby high rise, The Cigarette-Smoking Man eavesdrops on them with electronic listening devices, his sniper's rifle trained on the office's front door. Who will be his next target?

Frohike believes The Cigarette-Smoking Man was orphaned as a baby. His father, a Communist spy, was electrocuted. His mother died of lung cancer. In 1963, he was an Army Captain (whose only friend is the proud father of 1-year-old Fox Mulder). Recognizing his capabilities, the right-wing conspiracy that operates within the shadows of the official government recruits the young officer - his first assignment: the assassination of JFK. In its successful aftermath, he lights his first smoke...and becomes The Cigarette-Smoking Man.

By 1968, even J. Edgar Hoover takes orders from the Cigarette- Smoking Man, and no President has ever suspected he exists. The Cigarette-Smoking Man personally takes charge of the operation against Martin Luther King. Yet, even The Cigarette-Smoking Man has a dream. He longs to be a published author, and writes political potboilers under a pen name. Despite a pile of scathing rejections, he keeps trying.

Christmas 1991. The Cigarette-Smoking Man has covertly started wars, assassinated world leaders, rigged elections, the Oscars, the Olympics, the Super Bowl and moved the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley. Despite his power, he's a lonely man leading an empty life. He still can't get his written works published. And with the Soviet Union gone, he doesn't even have any more enemies.

Then it happens. A survivor is discovered in the wreckage of an alien craft. His mysterious associate, known to Mulder and Scully as Deep Throat executes the only alien which survived the crash The Cigarette- Smoking Man has a new purpose, and new truths to conceal. He goes forth on this mission with a vengeance. Young FBI agents Fox "Spooky" Mulder and Dana Scully take on the "X-Files." Unknowingly they are part of The Cigarette-Smoking Man's plans.

This year. The Cigarette-Smoking Man is jubilant when a magazine finally accepts one of his stories. He prepares his resignation, and lights his last cigarette. Until he realizes the magazine is nothing but a cheap girlie rag -- whose editors even had the nerve to change the story's ending. With all his dreams destroyed, he sits on a park bench and muses about the similarity of life to a cheap, tasteless box of chocolates. Resuming his role, The Cigarette-Smoking Man lights up a smoke.

The present. The Cigarette-Smoking Man's finger is on the trigger of a sniper rifle, ready to repeat the act which started his shadowy career. He watches Frohike leave the office. Does he shoot? No. He can kill Frohike any time he chooses, and he revels in that power.

@{fg shine}Tunguska [#80]@{fg text}

While performing a random search of a suitcase being carried by a man claiming to have diplomatic immunity, an airport customs agent is attacked by a black oil that congeals into tiny worms which penetrate his skin.

An anonymous tipster warns Mulder about a right-wing militia organization planning a bombing which could be the next Oklahoma City. The informant turns out to be Alex Krycek, the traitor Mulder blames for his father's murder. Left trapped in an abandoned missile silo by the Cigarette-Smoking Man, Krycek says he was freed by a militia group during a salvage operation. Claiming he wants revenge on the Cigarette-Smoking Man, Krycek promises Mulder that he can help expose the Cigarette-Smoking Man and the Shadowy Syndicate. Despite his hatred for Krycek, Mulder reluctantly believes him.

Krycek leads Mulder and Scully to intercept a Russian courier at the airport. The courier escapes, but the diplomatic pouch he is carrying is recovered. The pouch contains a four-billion-year-old rock of extraterrestrial origin. Dr. Sacks, a government exobiologist, drills into the rock. The same black worms which killed the customs agent emerge from the rock and attack him. Scully and Pendrell investigate this deadly enigma. Mulder's possession of the artifact alarms the Well-Manicured Man, who orders the Cigarette-Smoking Man to take care of the problem.

Mulder seeks out his UN contact, Marita Covarrubias, who finds out the origin of the Russian courier's flight. Mulder learns the flight originated near Tunguska, Siberia and instantly recognizes the significance. In 1908, a fireball crashed to earth in Tunguska, igniting a series of cataclysmic explosions. It was the most massive and most mysterious event of its kind in history. Until now, no one had been able to discover what really happened. Maybe someone has finally found out the truth...

Marita helps Mulder with credentials that will get him to Tunguska. At the last minute, Mulder discovers Krycek is fluent in Russian, and brings him along as a translator.

Mulder and Krycek discover a Siberian Gulag located at the site of the crash -- its hard-laboring prisoners sentenced to mine the extraterrestrial rocks. Before they can learn any more, they are captured, beaten and jailed. Mulder realizes Krycek is in league with their captors. Krycek is freed, and Mulder is subjected to an inhuman medical experiment. Under the most primitive of conditions, Mulder and other prisoners are infected with the oily black worms, and injected on the left arm with an amber liquid.

Will Mulder survive?

@{fg shine}Terma [#81]@{fg text}

In Tunguska, Mulder has survived his ordeal for now, but is still being held captive in a Siberian Gulag. The prisoner in the next cell explains that all the men in the camp are injected with "black cancer" until the toxin finally kills them. Escape is impossible. Resistance is futile. Mulder swears he will survive, long enough at least to kill Krycek. Impressed by Mulder's will to survive, the prisoner gives Mulder his own home-made knife. Back in Washington, Dr. Sacks is alive after being infected by the black worms from the rock that was recovered in the diplomatic pouch, although he is comatose. For Scully and Agent Pendrell, the medical mystery starts to unravel when tests reveal a black vermiform organism attached to his brain's pineal gland.

St. Petersburg. A former KGB assassin, Vassily Peskow, comes out of retirement when a messenger from "Comrade Arntzen" requests his help, and tells him the Cold War isn't over. Peskow makes his way to a horse farm which belongs to the Well-Manicured Man where he assassinates Dr. Bonita Chung-Sayre, a well-known authority on viruses and the Well-Manicured Man's personal physician.

Due to testify before the Senate Subcommittee hearing, Skinner presses a reluctant Scully for more information about the pouch and its contents. Skinner surprises her with his news: the pouch's intended recipient was the late Dr. Chung-Sayre, who was killed in a "riding accident."

Tunguska. The prisoners, including Mulder, are on the march. Nearby, Krycek is laughing it up with Mulder's tormentors. The sight spurs Mulder to action. Armed only with the knife, Mulder steals a battered truck and makes his escape, knocking Krycek into the back of the truck and taking him along for the ride. The chase ends when the truck's brakes give out. Krycek bails out before the crash, but Mulder is trapped inside. Krycek flees through the woods where he runs into a group of men - all of which are missing their left arm. Krycek tells them he is an escaped prisoner, and the men take him in. Meanwhile, Mulder has survived the accident and hides in the forest from his pursuing captors.

In Washington, Scully is jailed for contempt of Congress when she refuses to reveal Mulder's whereabouts at the Senate hearing. As she explains to Skinner, someone with a secret agenda is deliberately obfuscating the case: focusing on a missing FBI agent, rather than the existence of a toxic biohazard of extra-terrestrial origin and the deaths of those connected to it.

Mulder is discovered hiding in the woods by a family, who explains that the villagers' only means of saving themselves from the fatal experiments is a drastic one: amputation of the left arm. Mulder must persuade them to take him to St. Petersburg, or they may amputate his arm to "save" him. Unfortunately for Krycek, his rescuers "save" him as he sleeps.

Peskow continues his mission, paying a visit to the comatose Dr. Sacks whom he injects with the same amber fluid that had been shot into Mulder at the Gulag. The worms emerge, and he kills Sacks. At the Senate hearing, Scully is just about to be charged with contempt again...when Mulder appears, arm intact. Mulder's presence puts the attention back on the rock and the biotoxin, but when Scully tries to bring up the subject of the biotoxin's extraterrestrial origin, her claims are not taken seriously. Mulder interrupts the hearing, challenging the skepticism of the Senators when the most conservative scientists and science journals have every reason to believe that life exists outside our terrestrial sphere. Taken aback by Mulder's statement, the chairman of the subcommittee abruptly adjourns the hearing, calling for a recess until the evidence can be properly evaluated.

Following the lead that Dr. Chung-Sayre was the supervising physician at a nursing home in Boca Raton, Mulder and Scully travel to Florida to investigate. She and Mulder arrive too late. Peskow has already poisoned all of the patients and black worms have emerged from their deceased bodies. Mulder realizes a similar experiment to the one being conducted in Russia had been conducted at this nursing home. Still bent on finding a trace of evidence left behind, Mulder and Scully travel to New York where they interview the head of the militia group Krycek was running with. The militia member tells them Krycek told them his name was Arntzen, and that Krycek approached them. Everything Krycek told him was a lie. They also learn that the US government covered up their knowledge that Soviet-developed "black cancer" was deployed by Saddam during the Gulf War. Mulder now believes the whole thing was a set up from the beginning by someone who doesn't want the rocks in American hands. Finally, he discovers where Krycek is hiding another rock: Terma, North Dakota, in the stolen truck carrying the Militia's fertilizer bomb.

Again, Peskow is one step ahead of Mulder and Scully. He drives the truck to a Canadian oil refinery, intending to destroy the remaining rock. Mulder and Scully arrive too late to prevent Peskow from igniting a fiery explosion which engulfs the last piece of evidence. Both barely escape with their lives.

The final report on their investigation is turned over to the Senate subcommitte, but in vain. The Cigarette-Smoking Man controls the Senator who chairs the committee. In St. Petersburg, Peskow returns home to find Krycek, sporting a prosthetic left arm, who commends Peskow for a job well done.

@{fg shine}Paper Hearts [#82]@{fg text}

Mulder experiences a series of vivid dreams that lead him to the discovery of the long-buried skeleton of a murdered child. Mulder is shaken, recognizing the M.O. of serial killer John Lee Roche, one of the first killers Mulder profiled. Between 1979 and 1990, Roche abducted girls between the ages of 8 and 10 from their homes, strangled them, and cut a heart-shaped piece of fabric from their clothes as a trophy. When captured, Roche confessed to 13 murders. Mulder fears that this discovery means there are more victims than those Roche had admitted to. When the girl is identified, it proves that Roche began his crimes as early as 1975. Another clue from the dream helps Mulder locate where the killer hid his trophies. He finds a total of 16 hearts, and realizes there are two more unknown victims.

Scully and Mulder interview Roche in jail. He won't tell them about the missing children, and toys with their questions. Oddly, he comments that he understands why Mulder is taking the case personally. His meaning becomes clear with Mulder's next dream. Mulder goes back in time to the terrifying night in 1973 when his sister Samantha was abducted--except the creature who bursts through door is not an alien--it is Roche.

Could Roche have abducted and murdered Samantha? Mulder tries to get the truth from Roche, who claims that he sold a vacuum to Mulder's father before Samantha's disappearance. When Roche won't answer Mulder directly, Mulder becomes enraged and punches Roche in the face.

Scully, who witnessed Mulder's loss of control, tries to convince him the dreams are nothing but images from his subconscious. She is certain that Roche is only cleverly manipulating Mulder's emotions. Mulder always believed Samantha was abducted by aliens, and now he doesn't know what to believe. His fears seem confirmed when, in the basement of his family home, Mulder discovers the same model of vacuum that Roche claimed Mulder's father bought for his mother.

When Skinner finds out Mulder struck Roche, he denies Mulder further access to the prisoner. Yet Skinner is sympathetic when Mulder tells him his fears about Samantha, and finally allows Mulder interview Roche again, as long as Scully keeps an eye on him.

Mulder finally agrees to give Roche what he had been demanding: the heart trophies he cut out of pajamas of his victims. Now, Mulder demands to know the truth about Samantha. Roche's description of the night Samantha was abducted is exactly the same as Mulder remembers. He refuses to tell Mulder if one of the cloth hearts was taken from Samantha's clothing. Instead, he makes Mulder choose one of the hearts at random, and tells them where to find the body. Another body is discovered--it's not Samantha.

When Mulder and Scully return, Roche is fully in control. Refusing to divulge anything more unless he's taken to the scene of the crime. Scully can't stand to listen anymore, and makes Mulder leave with her. She insists that Roche is playing Mulder.

Willing to risk everything to find out the truth about his sister's abduction, Mulder makes a difficult decision. Without notifying Scully or Skinner, he releases Roche from jail and takes him to his childhood home in Martha's Vineyard. Inside the house, Roche describes everything in great detail--except, Mulder says they are in the wrong house. He has tricked Roche by deliberately taking him to a house 6 miles away from his childhood home. Now he now knows Roche has been lying all along. Mulder guesses that his extensive knowledge of Roche enabled Roche to get into his head saying, "I profiled you...maybe some connection was created between us. And through it, you pilfered my memories of Samantha."

Mulder plans to return Roche to jail the next morning. In the motel, he has one final dream of Samantha -- and wakes up to find himself bound in his own handcuffs with Skinner and Scully pounding on the motel room door. Roche is missing; and so are Mulder's FBI badge and his gun. With Mulder's ID, Roche tracks down the whereabouts of Caitlin, a little girl he had spotted on their flight to Boston. Mulder shoulder's all the blame for placing Caitlin in such horrific danger. And he admits to Scully that she was right. Roche was just playing him.

Mulder's knowledge of Roche pays off when he correctly identifies where Roche took the girl. He shoots Roche to save Caitlin's life...still plagued by the doubts Roche planted about Samantha's fate. With Roche dead, will Mulder ever find out the truth?

@{fg shine}El Mundo Gira [#83]@{fg text}

In a migrant workers' shantytown in California's San Joaquin Valley, Eladio Buente flirts with pretty Maria Dorantes while his brother Soledad watches jealously. Flakita, a nosy neighbor, bemoans the age-old story: "Two brothers. One woman. Trouble." Suddenly, three ear-splitting booms come from the sky, followed by a painfully bright flash, and a brief but torrential downpour of hot yellow rain. In its aftermath, Flakita discovers the mutilated corpses of Maria and one of her goats, their faces partially eaten away. Eladio is missing.

Mulder and Scully investigate the deaths. According to Mulder, the strange occurrences preceding Maria's death are called Fortean events, "An unusual or highly infrequent meteorological phenomenon...Fortean events have been linked to alien encounters, and cattle mutilations..." Scully greets Mulder's information with her usual skepticism. She can't tell much from the goat's corpse, and Maria's body is at the morgue.

According to Flakita, Maria was killed by El Chupacabra--the Goatsucker)--a gray hairless creature out of Puerto Rican folk tales with a small body, large head and bulging black eyes. Scully notes the amazing similarity between the descriptions of El Chupacabra and a gray alien. Soledad angrily refutes Flakita's story. He accuses his brother, Eladio, of killing Maria out of jealousy. This lover's triangle convinces Scully that Eladio is the killer, until she examines Maria's remains. The state of Maria's corpse shocks even Scully. It's hardly visible beneath mounds of greenish fungal growth. Meanwhile, Mulder locates Eladio with the help of Conrad Lozano, a cynical Immigration agent. Eladio is in INS custody, segregated from fearful prisoners who think he's El Chupacabra. Eladio denies killing Maria, claiming something or someone unknown mutilated Maria during the yellow rain. Mulder believes Eladio did not kill Maria, and Scully must agree. Scully's autopsy of the body revealed that Maria succumbed to a massive fungal infection--no one, she says, could deliberately do such a thing.

Eladio escapes from INS custody, and the agents discover the driver of the INS deportation bus dead from a different fungal infection. Mulder thinks there may be a connection between the fungi and the missing immigrant. Lozano and Mulder track Eladio to a construction site where he has found work, but the vengeful Soledad is also on Eladio's trail. Both brothers escape before Lozano and Mulder can take them into custody. The site's foreman is dead, his body ravaged by a myriad of fungi. Scully calls Mulder and warns him against touching or inhaling the lethal lichen. A mycology professor has isolated an enzyme that acts as a catalyst, accelerating fungal growth. If it escapes into the environment, there could be a biological hazard of frightening proportions.

Scully believes that Eladio is inadvertently responsible for deaths by spreading the enzyme which he somehow is carrying. Mulder now thinks the Fortean events could have been caused by something falling from space...which would mean the enzyme is alien. Scully,on the verge of losing patience with Mulder's theories, just wants to find the man who seems to be spreading it.

Now quite ill, Eladio begs his cousin Gabrielle for help. She reluctantly agrees to lend him money. Flakita, the village gossip, warns the agents that Soledad is planning to kill Eladio. Eladio eludes them again, but Lozano arrests Soledad.

When Eladio sees his own face for the first time, he can't believe the horror of it. He no longer looks human--Eladio has indeed transformed into El Chupacabra. Gabrielle tells Scully and Mulder that Eladio has run away to Mexico. But Mulder realizes it's a lie. Speeding on their way, he alerts a hazmat team to meet them at the shantytown...where it all began. Where the two brothers will finally settle their dispute over Maria.

What really happened that night? According to Flakita, Lozano brings Soledad to the camp, and orders Eladio to face his brother like a man. But Eladio is no longer a man...he is El Chupacabra. Flakita hides as gray aliens-- whom she calls Chupacabras--descend on the village. They kill Lozano, and take Soledad up in the sky with them.

Gabrielle weaves another tale. Lozano orders Eladio to face Soledad. In the horror of realizing his brother is El Chupacabra, Soledad can't shoot. He and Lozano struggle over the gun, and Lozano takes a bullet. The two brothers, now both Chupacabras, run away to Mexico.

The story Mulder and Scully report to Skinner isn't much clearer. All they know is that by the time they got to the camp, both the brothers were gone. Lozano was dead...brought down by two bullets and the fungus. And Los Chupacabras? The Buente brothers, their faces luridly disfigured, may have hitchhiked off into the Mexican night.

@{fg shine}Leonard Betts [#84]@{fg text}

Michele Wilkes, an Emergency Medical Technician, races an ambulance through the streets of Philadelphia as her highly-regarded partner, Leonard Betts, attends to a dying man. As the ambulance speeds through an intersection, it is broadsided by a truck. Wilkes survives, but she is horrified to discover Betts' decapitated body nearby.

Mulder and Scully are brought into the case when Betts' headless corpse disappears from a hospital morgue. Scully theorizes that someone attempted to steal the body and sell it to an unscrupulous medical supplier. But when security camera footage shows an unidentified person with a strange distortion around the head area leaving the hospital. Mulder suspects something strange is going on--perhaps the body left by itself.

With Mulder's reluctant help, Scully fishes through the hospital's bio-disposal unit for the missing corpse. The agents recover the missing head, but the whereabouts of the body remains a mystery. As Scully prepares to perform an autopsy on the head, its eyes and mouth suddenly snap open.

A tissue sample taken from Betts' head is analyzed by a pathologist who determines that Betts was riddled with cancer, so much that a normal human could have never lived that way. Mulder hypothesizes that Betts had somehow incorporated cancer into his body, and possessed unimaginable regenerative powers--perhaps the next step in Man's evolution. A fingerprint search reveals that Betts' real name is Albert Tanner. The agents interview his mother, Elaine, who claims that Albert died in an automobile accident six years earlier.

As Wilkes is transporting another patient, she recognizes Betts' voice transmitting over the ambulance radio. She locates Betts working as an EMT at another hospital. As the two embrace, Betts sadly pulls out a syringe and injects Michele with a lethal substance. A security guard witnesses the murder and handcuffs Betts to his car. Betts slips out of the cuffs by tearing off his own thumb. When the thumb is found, Mulder guesses he tore it off because he knew he could grow another.

When the agents search the trunk of Betts' car, they discover plastic bags filled with human tumors. Mulder postulates that Betts is ingesting the cancerous tissue in order to survive. They learn that the car is registered to Albert Tanner's mother.

Weak and needing sustenance, Betts attacks and kills a heavy-smoking bearded man after he leaves a bar. Strengthened, Betts is then able to "gives birth" to a duplicate of himself.

The agents discover a storage locker key at Mrs. Tanner's home. When they open the door to the locker, they find the smoking man's body, its left lung missing. Suddenly from within the locker, a car roars to life, and Betts attempts to run down Mulder and Scully. The agents dive for cover and open fire. The car bursts into flames, incinerating Betts.

Though Mulder is convinced that something else is going on, Scully reminds her partner that Betts is quite dead and his not coming back to life, and the case is over. Nonetheless, Mulder exhumes the body of the man Mrs. Tanner claimed was killed in the automobile accident. Inside the casket is a corpse identical to Betts. Mulder concludes that the fiery crash was a ruse-and the real Leonard Betts is still alive.

The agents stakeout Mrs. Tanner's home waiting for Betts to return. When an ambulance arrives at the scene, Mulder and Scully race inside. They find Mrs. Tanner, still clinging to life, with a fresh surgical incision on her chest. Mulder searches the neighborhood while Scully accompanies Tanner to the hospital, but when the ambulance pulls into the hospital parking lot, she realizes Betts hitched a ride by hiding on the vehicle's roof. Betts jumps inside the ambulance and slams the rear doors behind him. Wielding a scalpel, he tells Scully she possesses "something I need." A scuffle ensues, and Scully kills Betts using defibrillation pads. Later that night, as Scully lies in bed, she wakes up coughing and finds a few drops of blood on her pillow. As her nose continues to bleed, she recalls Betts' haunting words.

Ed Jerse, a handsome Philadelphia resident, is devastated as a judge decrees the harsh terms of his divorce settlement. After downing too many drinks at a neighborhood bar, Ed enters a tattoo parlor and selects a Betty Page-like design (on which is printed the words, "Never Again.") The next day, while at work, Ed hears a female voice refer to him as a "loser." Angered, Ed picks a fight with some women close to his cubicle, but they don't understand his anger. His boss sends him home for the day.

Meanwhile, Mulder tells Scully he must take time off for vacation or face losing several week's pay. Tension erupts between the pair when Mulder tells his partner what cases need her attention during his absence. Scully refuses to waste her time on a dubious case involving a Russian living in Philadelphia whom Mulder believes possesses valuable information on UFOs. Scully tells Mulder she feels as though she has lost sight of herself--as if her own life does nothing but stand still.

Now in his shabby apartment, Ed hears the female voice taunting him again, mocking him. Not realizing where the voice is coming from, he thinks it's his downstairs neighbor. The voice eventually drives Ed to the point of madness. In a rage, Ed bursts into the woman's apartment and attacks her. Later, he drags the body into the basement and stuffs it inside an incinerator.

Despite her reservations, Scully decides to keeps tabs on Mulder's Russian. She quickly realizes the man is an extortionist and his activities have nothing to do with the X-Files. Scully follows the Russian into a nearby tattoo parlor, where she strikes up a conversation with Ed (who is in the process of begging the tattoo artist to cover his handiwork). They strike up a conversation and an undeniable chemistry develops between the pair. Ed hands Scully his business card, and suggests they have dinner. She politely declines, but takes his card anyway.

After a tense phone conversation with Mulder about the Russian, Scully sets up a date with Ed. Scully tells Ed how her whole life, she's followed some type of father figure around, until she has to rebel. Ed observes that it looks like she's ready to rebel again. After consuming a few drinks, Scully and Ed return to the tattoo parlor, where Scully has the image of a snake eating its own tail tattooed on her back. The pair return to Ed's apartment. Noting the bad weather, Ed suggests Scully spend the night. Scully notices blood dripping from Ed's tattoo and, doctor-like, helps him pull off his shirt. A moment of intimacy develops, but before Ed can act upon his feelings, the Betty tattoo cries out: "Kiss her... and she's dead."

The next morning, Ed awakens on the couch. He leaves Scully a note that he is going to get breakfast. While Ed is away, detectives roust Scully from her sleep. They reveal that a resident downstairs was reported missing, and that a blood type different from her's was found inside the apartment. The detectives tell Scully that the blood contains chemical abnormalities. Seeing the chemical breakdown, Scully realizes it is composed of the same odd ingredients the Russian tattoo artist used to make the ink he used in their tattoos.

When Ed returns with breakfast, Scully tells him about the detectives' visit. She also reveals that the chemical found in the blood is an ergot alkaloid that can produce dangerous hallucinations. Ed confides in Scully about hearing Betty's voice in his head, taunting him, controlling him--but now that Scully is here, the voice has gone away. Now afraid for herself, Scully prepares to take them both to the hospital. But when Ed learns Scully is an FBI agent, he snaps. He attacks her and Scully is knocked unconscious. As Betty's voice urges him on, Ed drags Scully's body into the basement, intending to stuff it inside the incinerator. Scully regains consciousness and tells Ed to "take control." Suddenly, Ed gathers the strength to thrust his arm inside the incinerator, burning off the tattoo. He is transported to a burn center for treatment.

When Mulder returns from vacation, the air between him and Scully remains tense. Scully reminds her partner that not everything revolves around him-and that she intends to live her own life.

@{fg shine}Memento Mori [#86]@{fg text}

Scully shows Mulder an MRI x-ray indicating a cancerous mass has been detected on the wall between her sinus and cerebrum. The tumor is inoperable and if it grows, the chance for survival is slim. Instead of requesting a leave of absence, Scully opts to follow another avenue of investigation: contacting a group of purported female abductees who experienced similar symptoms after having implants removed from the base of their necks.

The agents travel to the home of Betsy Hagopian in Allentown, Pennsylvania where Scully had met these women before. A realtor informs them that Hagopian (one of the female abductees) passed away two weeks earlier. While searching through Hagopian's house, the agents realize someone is downloading computer files via phone modem. The call is traced, and the agents apprehend Kurt Crawford, the man who downloaded the files. Crawford explains that he and Hagopian were both members of the same UFO network and downloaded Hagopian's files because the government is out to destroy them. Crawford also reveals that all of the women who claimed they were abducted by aliens died of similar tumors, with the exception of Penny Northern, who is now hospitalized and near death from cancer.

Scully visits Northern at the hospital, who reveals that Dr. Scanlon, who has been treating her cancer, may have isolated the cause. Seeing her future self in Penny's condition, Scully checks herself in and Dr. Scanlon begins treating her cancer. Meanwhile, Mulder and Crawford search through hard files in Hagopian's basement. They discover that all of the woman abductees, including Northern, were treated at the same fertility clinic in Pennsylvania. When Scully asks Mulder to bring her overnight bag to the hospital, Mulder leaves Crawford in the basement to attend to Scully. Later that evening, the Gray-Haired Man (the same man who killed X) shows up and kills Crawford, whose body melts into a pool of green liquid.

Meanwhile, Mulder breaks into a federally-subsidized fertility clinic where all the female UFO network members were patients. Inside, he discovers Kurt Crawford (Mulder is unaware of the other Crawford's death). They access a computer terminal and download a directory containing Scully's name. Near the breaking point, Mulder demands that Skinner arrange a meeting with The Cigarette-Smoking Man. But Skinner refuses, insisting The Cigarette-Smoking Man deals only in lies. Nonetheless, Skinner secretly enlists The Cigarette-Smoking Man's help.

Mulder turns to the Lone Gunmen, who tell him that the fertility clinic's mainframe is housed in a high-security federal research facility. The foursome infiltrate the research facility, and once inside, Mulder realizes Dr. Scanlon is on staff. He instructs Byers to find Scully and stop her treatment immediately. As he continues through the building's corridors, Mulder encounters additional Crawfords and realizes Kurt is a clone. He finds several of them dressed as doctors inside an incubator room housing tanks containing human forms, including those of Samantha. One of the Kurts shows Mulder a cold storage room containing vials of human ova--including a vial with Scully's name on it. The eggs were harvested from women during their abduction, which were later used for reproduction. Mulder realizes the women are the Kurts' birth mothers and the clones are actually working to save their mothers' lives.

The Gray-Haired Man arrives at the clinic and traps Mulder between two security doors in a quarantine wing. The Gray-Haired Man opens fire, slowly cracking the bullet proof glass that stands between himself and his prey. Working feverishly, Frohike breaks a computer code from a remote location, allowing Mulder to open the outside door and run to safety.

When Mulder returns to the hospital, he finds Scully at Penny's bedside. Byers arrived in time to stop Scully's treatment, but Penny Northern had died and Dr. Scanlon was gone. Scully tells her partner she has decided to fight the disease and continue her work.

Mourners gather at a cemetery in Brooklyn to pay their last respects to Isaac Luria, a Hasidic man brutally murdered by three teenaged hate-mongers. Among the group is Ariel Luria, and her father, Jacob Weiss. When night falls, a shadowy figure enters the cemetery and shapes a man-sized sculpture out of mud.

Mulder and Scully investigate Isaac Luria's death. Isaac, who lived in a neighborhood with a history of racial tension, was severely beaten inside his market. Police ruled out robbery as a motive as nothing was stolen. They later retrieved a store surveillance tape from the VCR of a sixteen year-old named Tony Oliver, one of the teenagers who participated in the killing. Oliver was strangled by an unknown assailant. Most intriguing to Mulder is the discovery of Isaac Luria's finger prints on Oliver's body.

Weiss shows them an anti-Semitic pamphlet left at his door that very morning. Mulder tells his partner that whoever printed the pamphlets probably knows who killed Isaac. The agents interview Curt Brunjes, who owns a copy shop across the street from Isaac's market. When the agents show Brunjes photos of Banks and Macguire, (the teenagers suspected of beating Isaac), he claims their faces are unfamiliar. Unbeknownst to the agents, Banks listens in on the conversation via a security surveillance camera. Scully tells Brunjes there are rumors that Isaac has risen from the grave to avenge his murder.

Spooked, Banks and Macguire dig up Isaac's coffin. As Macguire walks to the car to retrieve some tools, Banks pries open the coffin lid and discovers Isaac's body inside. Later, Banks finds Macguire's body protruding from a mound of mud.

The agents are called to the crime scene. Mulder locates a slender leather book tucked beneath Isaac's burial shroud. But when he touches the old book, it suddenly bursts into flames. The agents turn to Kenneth Ungar, a scholar from the judaica Arcl-iives. Ungar explains that what Mulder found was a book on Jewish mysticism. He insists it would never have been buried with the dead. Ungar notes a name engraved into the leather: Jacob Weiss.

Ariel tells the agents that although she and her husband received their wedding license weeks before the murder, the marriage ceremony never transpired.

The agents locate Weiss in the attic of a synagogue. They also discover Banks' dead body hanging from a wooden beam. Weiss is arrested and charged with murder. He admits to both of the murders, but Mulder believes someone--or something--was in the attic with him.

Unger tells Mulder about the Golem, a creature from mystical text. He explains how early Kabbalists believed a righteous man could create a living being from the earth itself. A single Hebrew word, "emet," is inscribed on the back of the Golem's hand. To destroy the Golem, Unger explains, the first letter, "e," must be erased.

Brunjes is found murdered. When the agents examine the surveillance camera tape. they discover that the Golem whose physical features match those of Isaac Luria is responsible for the murder. Weiss returns to the synagogue after he is released from jail. There he discovers Ariel preparing for her wedding ceremony. When Weiss attempts to stop his daughter, the Golem attacks him. The agents rescue Weiss and, as Scully attends to his injuries, Mulder searches for Ariel. The Golem attacks Mulder, knocking him aside as he attempts to fend off the being. But Ariel intercedes.

When the wedding continues, the Golem places a ring on Ariel's finger. Ariel expresses her love for Isaac, then wipes the letter "e" off the Golems' hand. The creature crumbles into dust.

A crowd gathers at the U.S. Capitol Mall, near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. As the re-dedication ceremony begins, General Benjamin Bloch steps up to a podium and delivers his speech. A short distance away, Mulder, Scully and other FBI agents feverishly hunt down an armed man making his way through the crowd. When Mulder attempts to focus on the suspect, he seemingly vanishes.

As the story unfolds in flashback, Lieutenant General Peter MacDougal is gunned down at close range in the back seat of a limousine, a Death Card at his side. Though the murder weapon is never located, the General's driver, who has ties to a radical paramilitary group called the Right Hand, is held on suspicion of murder. But the driver, who maintains his innocence, passes a polygraph test, and lab tests reveal he did not fire a weapon. With dozens of high-ranking military officials arriving in Washington for the re-dedication ceremony, Skinner assigns his agents to investigate the Right Hand movement, and its leader, an ex- Marine named Denny Markham.

Markham gives the FBI a photograph of a man named Nathaniel Teager, a Green Beret captured by the enemy in 1971. Markham's group liberated Teager from a POW camp in 1995. When U.S. government commandos attempted to kidnap Teager, he suddenly disappeared. Scully suspects Markham's story is a cover-up for an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy plan. Meanwhile, Teager approaches a woman, Renee Davenport, as she views the Memorial. He informs Davenport her husband is still alive and gives her his dog tags as proof. Suddenly, Teager disappears.

Davenport positively identifies Teager as the man she saw at the memorial. Scully takes Davenport to an ophthalmologist when her eye hemorrhages. She is diagnosed with a floating blind spot-but the cause is undetermined.

Mulder learns that MacDougal was one of the original military officials who signed Teager's death certificate (even though forensic evidence was inconclusive). Mulder assigns two FBI agents to guard General Steffan, one of MacDougal's counterparts (who also signed the certificate). But Teager slips by the agents and murders Steffan.

A security camera captured Teager's image passing through a metal detector at the Pentagon. Skinner is outraged. Mulder tells Skinner that Teager has the ability to hide himself from a person's field of vision. He notes that, during the war, U.S. soldiers reported that Viet Cong guerrillas had the ability to appear and disappear at will. He speculates that Teager learned this trick during his 25 years in the POW camp.

Mulder believes the only way to stop Teager is to find his next victim. Marita Covarrubias tells Mulder that MacDougal, Steffan and a third general headed a secret three-man commission that covertly disposed of South Vietnamese soldiers who cooperated with the U.S. government during the war. Covarrubias reveals that testimony from the generals could have been used in the calculation of reparations. Mulder realizes the government wanted the generals dead all along. Covarrubias gives him the name of the third general: Bloch.

Bloch is rushed from the podium at the re-dedication after the agents spot Teager in the crowd. Skinner escorts Bloch toward an awaiting limo. Mulder, however, realizes Teager is hiding inside. Skinner tackles Bloch moments before gunshots flash from inside the limo. Teager puts the limo in gear and attempts to make a getaway. Agent Hill opens fire, killing him.

@{fg shine}Tempus Fugit [#89]@{fg text}

At the Headless Woman's Pub, waiters singing "Happy Birthday" approach Mulder and Scully's table. Scully is surprised that her partner remembered the occasion. Before the celebration continues, the agents are approached by Sharon Graffia, who identifies herself as the sister of Max Fenig (the alien abductee seen in "Fallen Angel"). Fenig was killed in an airplane crash in Upstate New York two hours earlier. It was Fenig's wish that the agents be sought out should any harm befall him.

The agents attend a Go-Team meeting assembled by the National Transportation Safety Board. Mike Millar, the man in charge of the operation, plays a tape recording of the last radio exchange between Flight 549 and air traffic control in Albany. During the recording, the pilot makes reference to an "intercept." Mulder believes is an indication the airliner was forced out of the sky. But his comments before the group are met with great skepticism.

The agents comb the crash site for possible clues. Mulder realizes there is a nine minute discrepancy between the official time of the crash and the time indicated on passengers' wrist watches. In the distance, an investigator named Garrett sprays an acid-like substance on one of the bodies, dissolving the victim's fingertips and face. A few moments later, other Go-Team members pull a survivor, Larold Rebhun, from the wreckage. Scully concludes he was exposed to extreme radiation. Mulder tells Scully that he believes Fenig was abducted from the aircraft by being sucked out of the emergency exit door. However, Go-Team members find Fenig's body amongst the debris field.

The agents interview Louis Frish, who, along with Armando Gonzales, manned the Air Force Reserve air control tower on the night of the crash. Louis claims there was no radio contact between the Air Force and the civilian plane. Later, Louis finds Gonzales' dead body inside the control tower. Several government men storm the tower. Louis avoids capture by hiding on the roof. Later, Sharon Graffia disappears from her motel room. Mulder concludes she was abducted by a UFO.

Louis Frish tells Mulder, Scully, and Millar that he-not an air traffic controller in Albany-was the last person to communicate with Flight 549. Louis explains that his commanding officer ordered him (along with Gonzales) to lie to investigators. The men saw an unidentified radar blip enter Flight 549's airspace. Moments later, there was an explosion. Mulder speculates that a third, unidentified aircraft shot down the intercept craft-but is at a loss to explain the absence of a second crash site. As the agents drive Louis away from the Go-Team's headquarters, two automobiles give chase. In an attempt to outmaneuver his pursuers, Mulder drives onto a runway. An airliner lands on the strip, narrowly missing Mulder's car. The two chase cars break off their pursuit. Later, Mike Millar encounters a UFO hovering above the crash site. He finds Sharon Graffia nearby.

Scully and Louis await a Federal Marshal at the Headless Woman's Pub. Garrett enters with a gun. Scully draws her weapon and a shoot-out ensues. Agent Pendrell, who happened to be frequenting the bar, is shot in the chest. Scully manages to shoot Garrett in the leg.

After examining a map, Mulder concludes that the second craft crashed into Great Sacandaga Lake. He scuba dives into the murky water, where he encounters twisted wreckage-and the body of a gray alien. Suddenly, a bright beam of light emanates from the surface. Mulder shields his eyes from the impossibly intense light.

As seen in the previous episode, Mulder, clad in scuba gear, inspects (what appears to be) the wreckage of a UFO deep beneath the murky waters of Great Sacandaga Lake in Upstate New York. A bright beam of light penetrates the darkness, illuminating the agent. The light's source is revealed to be a team of frogmen, accompanied by an amphibious craft equipped with large searchlights. Mulder attempts to make an escape, but he is placed under military arrest.

A wounded Garrett escapes from the Headless Woman Pub. Scully immediately turns her attention to Agent Pendrell, who was caught in the crossfire. Paramedics are called to the scene and Pendrell is transported to a nearby hospital. Skinner tells Scully that Louis Frish is being placed under military arrest (for suspicion of murder and providing false testimony to a federal investigation).

Mulder is released from jail. The Air Force asserts that Flight 549 collided with a military fighter jet when Frish and his tower co-controller made an error in judgment. Based on the wreckage he saw beneath Lake Sacandaga, Mulder believes Flight 549 collided with a UFO (after it was shot down by a military jet). Scully tells Mulder that Agent Pendrell died of his injuries. Mulder conveys his sympathies.

Records reveal that Sharon Graffia is not Max Fenig's sister, but an unemployed aeronautical engineer who spent time in mental institutions (where she met Fenig). The agents search Fenig's mobile home. They discover a videotape in which Fenig states that the military salvaged alien technology for use in their own technological applications. He claims to have undeniable, irrefutable proof to back up his assertion.

Mulder describes for Mike Millar the sequence of events that (he believes) led to the downing of Flight 549. According to Mulder, Max boarded the plane carrying physical proof of the existence of extraterrestrial life. Someone followed him aboard the craft, intending to obtain the object at any cost. But before the assassin could carry out his plot, Flight 549 was intercepted by a UFO. As the UFO began to abduct Fenig, flight controllers ordered a military jet into 549's airspace on a mission to destroy the alien craft. When the Air Force shot down the UFO, the airliner, caught in its "tractor beam," spun out of control and crashed.

The manager of the trailer park where Fenig lived gives Mulder Fenig's undelivered mail. One envelope contains a luggage claim ticket bearing a three-letter designation for Syracuse. Meanwhile, Scully meets with Sharon Graffia at a mental health center. She admits she stole an object from her employer after Max insisted it could prove the existence of alien life. The object was divided into three parts. Max and Sharon each took a segment, but they were later confiscated.

Mulder finds the third piece inside Fenig's luggage at the Syracuse airport. He boards a flight for Washington, but is followed by Garrett (Agent Pendrell's killer). Mulder gets the jump on Garrett and confines him to a bathroom aboard the plane. He telephones Scully and instructs her to meet him at Dulles airport. Suddenly, Mulder's wrist watch stops running. A UFO intercepts the aircraft and, during the commotion, Garrett escapes from the lavatory. He grabs a knapsack containing the third stolen alien segment. As a bright light from the UFO engulfs the plane, Mulder instructs Garrett to drop the bag. But Garrett refuses to do so. When the plane lands at Dulles airport, Garrett is not on board. Mulder tells Skinner that Garrett "caught a connecting flight."

@{fg shine}Synchrony [#91]@{fg text}

Jason Nichols and Lucas Menand, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, become embroiled in an argument as they walk down a city street. They are approached by an elderly man, who warns Menand that he will be run over by a bus at exactly eleven forty-six that evening. Menand tells a campus security cop that the old man is harassing him. The guard places him in the back seat of a sedan and drives away. A few moments later, Menand is run down by the bus... at exactly eleven forty-six.

Mulder and Scully review the facts of the case. Nichols was taken into custody after the bus driver told police that he pushed Menand into the path of his vehicle. But Nichols tells authorities he was attempting to save Menand-as an unidentified old man had forewarned of his colleague's impending death.

The security guard who arrested the old man is found frozen to death. Scully concludes guard was somehow exposed to some sort of chemical refrigerant, as weather conditions are too warm to explain the corpse's frigid internal temperature. Mulder interviews Nichols at the police station. Nichols explains that he and Menand had been arguing because Menand threatened to go public with a claim that he had falsified data on a research paper.

A short time later, the elderly man kills Dr. Yonechi, a Japanese researcher, by pricking him with a metallic stylus. Mulder and Scully examine Yonechi's frozen corpse. Lab tests reveal that the doctor was injected with an unidentifiable chemical compound. The agents approach Nichol's girlfriend, Lisa Ianelli, who is also a researcher. She recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Nichols had been engineering for years. But she points out that the chemical has not yet been invented. Lisa tells the agents that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi. But his body temperature suddenly and rapidly begins to increase, until finally, he bursts into flames. Lisa realizes she made an error when she recommended that doctors remove Yonechi's body from a tub filled with yellowish fluid.

Lisa confesses that it was she who falsified the data to get the research grant (Nichols is in jail because he is covering for her). Those who would have figured out the truth-Menand and Yonechi-are now dead. Police receive a tip that the elderly man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the elderly man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Nichols, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses inside the cryology lab. Mulder realizes the photo was taken five years in the future-on the day the researchers successfully synthesized the freezing compound. The elderly man is attempting to alter that future: when he failed to save Menand from being killed by the bus, he killed Yonechi. Mulder also realizes the elderly man is none other than Jason Nichols.

Lisa locates the elderly man and confronts him. The elderly man gathers the courage to inject her with the chemical. But Scully successfully resuscitates Lisa, and remembering the girl's words, immediately returns her body to the tub (to prevent the fire that killed Yonechi). Nichols confronts his elderly self in the computer mainframe room at the cryogenic lab, where the old man has erased all of Nichols' files from the computer. Nichols lunges at the old man, choking him. Mulder, unable to open the lab door, yells to Nichols. He tells him that Lisa is alive. The old man tells Nichols that "it's better that we never were." Wrapping his arms around his younger self, the old man bursts into flames. The fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.

Doctors in Martinsburg, West Virginia, attend to a woman, Amanda Nelligan, as she goes into labor. When a nurse asks about the baby's father, Amanda tells her that the child's father is from another planet. When the baby is delivered, those in attendance gasp in horror when they see that the crying newborn has a four-inch tail.

Word of the strange birth is spread by newspaper tabloids, and Mulder and Scully travel to Martinsburg to investigate. During the drive, Mulder notes that five babies were born with vestigial tails over the course of three months -- all within a city of less than 15,000 people. Scully hypothesizes that the abnormalities may be attributable to ground water contamination or prescription drug interaction.

At the hospital, Amanda, a Star Wars fan, tells the agents the baby's father is Luke Skywalker. She recounts the tale of how Luke Skywalker came to her home and romanced her. With the assistance of a Health Department doctor, Scully determines that each of the five children born with tails share the same father. Mulder notes that all five women also shared the same fertility specialist, Dr. Alton Pugh.

When the agents arrive at Pugh's office, they discover several angry couples confronting the doctor about the births. As Mulder looks around the doctor's office, he encounters a janitor, Eddie Van Blundht, fixing a leaky sink inside an exam room and notices above his sagging pants a feint, roughly triangular scar at the base of the man's spine. Eddie tries to run, but is quickly apprehended and taken into custody. All of the women present swear that the only person they have had sex with has been their husbands. Later, a paternity test reveals that Eddie is the father of all five children. Scully hypothesizes that he may have used the tranquilizer Rohypnol to incapacitate his victims. Eddie, a homely man, responds defensively at the inference that the only reason a woman would have sex with him is if she was coerced.

While a sheriff's deputy is filling out his arrest record, Eddie suddenly changes form, metamorphosing into an exact duplicate of the deputy. Eddie strikes the astonished deputy on the head and makes his getaway. After questioning the deputy, Mulder concludes that Eddie impregnated four of the five women by making himself look like their husbands. The fifth woman, Amanda, was tricked into believing she was making love to Luke Skywalker.

The agents travel to the Van Blundht residence, where they meet Edward Sr. He claims he once performed as "Eddie the Monkey Man" and still has his tail intact. As they talk to him they realize the old man is, in fact, Eddie Jr. in a different form. Eddie suddenly runs out of the house and disappears into the neighborhood. After searching the house they discover the mummified body of the real Edward Sr. inside the attic. Scully's autopsy reveals an anomalous muscular structure beneath the surface of the corpse's skin. Essentially the man's skin was also a muscle. Mulder speculates that if Eddie inherited this same trait, it would explain his ability to change form. Meanwhile, Eddie metamorphoses once again -- this time into a duplicate Mulder. The real Mulder tracks him to a locker room at the hospital where Amanda Nelligan is staying. Suddenly, Eddie bursts through the ceiling, knocking him to the ground. He ties up the real Mulder and locks him inside the hospital's boiler room.

Pretending to be Mulder, Eddie returns to Washington with Scully, files a report with Assistant Director Skinner and closes the case. Later, the fake Mulder shows up at Scully's apartment with a bottle of wine. After spending the evening having relaxing conversation and relating in a personal rather than professional manner, Scully tells the fake Mulder, "I really feel like I'm seeing a different side of you tonight." The fake Mulder leans in close, and prepares to give her a kiss. Just as their lips are about to meet, the real Mulder kicks in the front door and interrupts them. Eddie slumps back on the couch, thwarted, and transforms back to his normal appearance and is taken into custody.

Jane Brody, a mail sorter at an overnight delivery company, sneaks into the female employee's rest room to smoke a cigarette. Without warning, hundreds of bees creep into the stall where Jane is sitting. When the young woman attempts to swat the insects so she can escape, the bees swarm and attack, stinging her to death.

An e-mail file containing photographs of the victim is sent to Mulder, but Skinner intercepts and deletes the file. Skinner then covertly erases evidence of the bee attack, and incinerates Jane Brody's body. Identifying himself as Fox Mulder, Skinner visits a police forensics lab in Virginia where he switches a vial containing Brody's blood with another identical container. As he is leaving, Skinner is approached by Detective Ray Thomas, the man who e-mailed Mulder photographs of Brody's body. Skinner tells the disappointed Thomas (who thinks he is talking to Fox Mulder) that the evidence does not warrant his further involvement in the case.

Mulder pays Skinner an unexpected visit. He states that someone has gone to great lengths to keep news of the bee attack from reaching him. He also reveals that Detective Thomas was found dead, the victim of an execution-style shooting. With Scully undergoing tests at a hospital for the treatment of her cancer, Mulder asks Skinner for his help in solving the mystery. Later that night, Skinner is approached by The Cigarette-Smoking Man. Skinner accuses him of murdering Detective Thomas. The Cigarette-Smoking Man counters that Skinner "failed to neutralize a potentially compromising situation."

Mulder discovers that someone stole Brody's body from a morgue and switched her blood sample at the police station. He also discovers that Thomas was murdered by someone using a government issue gun. Shortly thereafter, Skinner realizes his own weapon is missing. Skinner revisits the women's rest room where Brody was killed. He discovers part of a massive honeycomb inside the rest room wall, and brings a piece of the honeycomb to entomologist Peter Valdespino for analysis.

Mulder discovers that a bank surveillance camera captured a blurry image of someone talking to Detective Thomas shortly before he was murdered. He hopes the Bureau's Photo Unit can produce a clearer image of the man who he suspects is Thomas' killer. Using larvae taken from the honeycomb, Valdespino hatches more bees to identify the species. The insects unexpectedly swarm the entomologist, killing him. Mulder later discovers that Valdespino died from smallpox. He hypothesizes that someone has engineered a method of spreading the contagion using the insects.

Skinner questions Brody's co-worker, Misty Nagata. She reveals that a damaged overnight package was confiscated by other investigators working on the case. Students at an elementary school in South Carolina are attacked by a swarm of bees. Skinner tells doctors at a hospital emergency room that the children should be treated not for bee stings, but for smallpox.

Working from surveillance camera footage, the FBI photo unit produces a clear image of Skinner talking to Thomas shortly before his death. Outraged, Mulder accuses Skinner of working in conjunction with The Cigarette-Smoking Man from the very beginning. But Skinner insists he was framed.

Skinner again confronts The Cigarette-Smoking Man, firing several shots in anger. Afterward, The Cigarette-Smoking Man instructs Marita Covarrubias, in the company of Syndicate members, to tell Mulder whatever he wants to hear.

Angie Pintero, the working-class owner of a bowling alley, tells one of his employees, a mentally-disturbed, compulsive man named Harold Spuller, to go home for the evening. Shortly thereafter, Angie discovers a badly-injured blond girl wedged inside a pinspotter carriage. The girl attempts to speak, but no words come out of her mouth. Angie notices police in a nearby parking lot and rushes outside to get help. He realizes a crowd has gathered around the dead body of the same girl he saw only moments earlier in the bowling alley.

Angie relates his bizarre tale to Mulder and Scully. Mulder suspects that Angie encountered the dead girl's ghost, a spirit that was attempting to communicate with the living for reasons unknown. Three similar encounters, and three similar murders, were reported in the area in as many weeks. The agents discover the words, "She is me" written on the bowling lane where Angie saw the spirit. But its meaning remains a mystery.

Detective Hudak tells Mulder and Scully that an anonymous caller phoned 911 with a message regarding Penny Timmons, one of the killer's victims. The caller claimed that Timmons' last words were "She is me." But Hudak notes the victim's larynx was severed, making it impossible for her to utter dying words.

The agents trace the source of the 911 call to a payphone at the New Horizon Psychiatric Center. Mulder notices one of the patients, Harold Spuller, avoiding his gaze. After viewing photographs of the murder victims, Scully comes to the conclusion that Spuller fits the killer's profile: a compulsive person consumed with the desire to organize, clean and reorder.

Scully uses a rest room to attend to a nose bleed. There she encounters the spirit of another blond girl. Moments later, Mulder relays word that the body of yet another victim was found nearby.

Mulder discovers Harold holed-up in a dimly-lit room accessible from the bowling alley. The walls of the room are covered with score sheets, including those of the victims. Mulder realizes that Harold met each of the murdered women at the bowling alley. Suddenly, Harold lapses into a strange seizure. From his point of view, he sees Angie's ghost standing behind Mulder. He rushes out of the room and makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead, the victim of a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person who saw the apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.

Harold is transported back to the psychiatric center. There, he is tormented by Nurse Innes, who ridicules his intellect and physique. Later, Mulder finds Innes lying on the floor, half-conscious. Innes claims Harold went berserk and attacked her. One of the other patients, Chuck Forsch, tells Scully that Nurse Innes was trying to poison Harold. Scully slowly realizes that Innes, not Harold, was responsible for the murders. When Innes attacks Scully with a scalpel, Scully draws her weapon and fires, striking her in the shoulder. Afterward, Scully tells Mulder that Innes has been ingesting Harold's medication, triggering violent and unpredictable behavior. She hypothesizes that Innes was out to destroy the love Harold felt towards the young women. Later, Harold's body is discovered in a nearby alley, the apparent victim of respiratory failure. But Scully suspects Harold died from what Innes took away from him.

Scully admits to Mulder that she saw the ghost of the fourth victim shortly after she was murdered. Later, Scully sees Harold's spirit sitting in the back seat of her car.

Mulder experiences a dreamlike vision, apparently a memory from childhood, in which he sees his mother and father reacting as if some terrible tragedy has entered their home. Mulder awakens in a motel room, sweating profusely, his hands and shirt stained with blood. He telephones Scully, who drives to the motel to offer assistance. Suffering from a mental blackout, Mulder cannot recall how he got to the motel. Scully discovers that two rounds were fired from his gun. She also traces a car parked outside Mulder's room to a David and Amy Cassandra. The agents travel to the Cassandra residence, where they speak with a house-keeper. Inside the home are dozens of paintings of a white clapboard house. Mulder realizes he was inside the home, but cannot remember why.

The housekeeper gives the agents the address of the home depicted in the painting. As Mulder approaches the dwelling, he is suddenly struck by a flashback in which he encounters a young Cigarette-Smoking Man inside his parent's home. When the seizure subsides, the agents walk inside the cottage, where they find the dead bodies of David and Amy Cassandra.

Blood from both victims is found on Mulder's shirt. Detective Curtis places Mulder under arrest. But a toxicology report reveals traces of the anesthetic Ketamine in Mulder and Amy Cassandra's blood. Scully realizes the drug could account for Mulder's memory loss. A short time later, Michael Fazekas, an admitting officer, steps inside a bathroom at the police station and shoots himself in the head. Scully discovers a small scab on the man's scalp, similar to one found on Amy's hairline. Detective Curtis reveals that Fazekas was a believer in UFOs. Inside Fazekas' apartment, Scully discovers a UFO magazine featuring a photograph of Amy, who believed she was an alien abductee.

A forensics report reveals that the blood spatter pattern on Mulder's shirt does not correspond to the point of entry detail. Curtis concludes the Cassandras died as the result of a murder-suicide. Further research reveals that Amy had been seeing Dr. Charles Goldstein, a psychiatrist, in an effort to recover suppressed memories. Goldstein admits he used unconventional therapy to stimulate electrical impulses in the brain.

Mulder suffers another seizure. During the attack, he experiences a vision in which a young Cigarette-Smoking Man pulled Mrs. Mulder close to him, as if to kiss her. Mulder and Scully drive to Mrs. Mulder's Greenwich home. There, Mulder confronts his mother. He accuses her of lying to him about having been forced to choose Samantha over him. He also accuses her of being unfaithful to his father. Mrs. Mulder angrily denies the allegations. Mulder storms out of the house and drives off.

Mulder pulls a gun on Dr. Goldstein and forces him to finish his treatment--to make him relive (what he believes to be) to his past. Goldstein drugs Mulder, then slowly lowers a spinning needle towards his hairline. Police arrive at the scene and place Goldstein under arrest, but Mulder's whereabouts are unknown. The psychiatrist tells Scully that Mulder left his office "to exorcise his demons." Scully finds him at the house in Quonochontaug, balled up on the floor, a gun in his hand. Jolted by seizures, Mulder aims his gun at Scully. She attempts to convince him that the powerful hallucinogen injected into his body has affected his mind and that his visions, his apparent memories, cannot be trusted. Mulder fires a shot, but the bullet shatters a wall mirror behind Scully. Breaking down into tears, Mulder lowers the weapon. Scully's fear changes to sympathy as she comforts her partner.

Scully enters Mulder's apartment, where a group of detectives and forensic technicians are waiting. Detective Rempulski introduces himself, then pulls back a sheet draped over a body lying on the floor. Scully positively identifies the victim. Later, Scully appears before a group of FBI officials led by Section Chief Scott Blevins. During the meeting, Scully recounts how, four years earlier, Blevins assigned her to a project known as The X-Files. She states that the purpose of the current meeting is to report on the illegitimacy of Mulder's work.

In flashback, a pair of anthropologists, Arlinsky and Babcock, are flown by helicopter to a snowbound camp at the base of a mountain. Accompanied by a guide, the pair make their way up the steep terrain. Upon reaching the summit, the men enter a cave where the body of a gray alien is perfectly preserved in ice.

A group of guests gather at Mrs. Scully's house for a dinner party. Amongst the attendees are Dana's brother, Bill Scully, Jr., and a Catholic Priest, Father McCue. Scully realize McCue was invited by her mother for the purpose of discussing her faith at a time when Scully's health is at great risk due to her cancer. After dinner, Father McCue and Scully briefly talk about her drifting from the church before their discussion is interrupted by a phone call from Mulder. He has received information about a something that was discovered in Canada.

Mulder arranges for Scully to meet he and Arlinsky at the Smithsonian. Arlinsky claims that, based upon ice core samples taken from the scene, the alien body is some two hundred years old. He asks for the agents' assistance in verifying the alien remains. Mulder and Arlinsky fly to the base camp, which is eerily deserted. Unbeknownst to them, a mysterious assassin armed with a shotgun pistol has murdered the Summiteers. Upon reaching the summit, the men discover the bodies of Babcock and a foreman. Inside the cave is a rectangular hole where the alien body had been entombed. Later, Babcock, injured but alive, tells the pair that he buried the alien body beneath his tent.

Meanwhile, Scully and lab scientist Vitagliano examine ice core samples taken from the cave. Later that night, Scully returns to the Bio Lab, where she is assaulted and thrown down a flight of stairs by an unidentified attacker. Agent Hedin matches fingerprints found on the stairwell to a Michael Kritschgau, who works for the Pentagon's research division. After viewing a personnel file, Scully positively identifies Kritschgau as her attacker. Later, she confronts Kritschgau inside a parking garage and places him under arrest. But Kritschgau warns that if he is taken to jail, the same people who gave Scully cancer will kill him.

Mulder and Arlinsky transport the alien body to a warehouse where an autopsy can be performed. Scully contacts her partner at the warehouse and arranges a meeting so he can hear Kritschgau's story firsthand. Soon afterward, the assassin, Ostelhoff, shoots and kills Arlinsky and Babcock at the warehouse. Meanwhile, Kritschgau, who claims to have run the Department of Defense's agitprop arm, tells the agents that the government has been orchestrating an elaborate hoax to divert attention away from itself. The alien corpse, Kritschgau claims, was forged from bio-materials and frozen into place over the course of a year. He insists Mulder was only meant to see the alien--to make him believe the lie. Mulder counters that it is Kritschgau who is the liar. But when Mulder returns to the warehouse, he discovers the dead bodies of Arlinsky and Babcock--and the alien specimen missing. Shortly thereafter, Scully tells him the men behind the hoax gave her cancer all in an effort to make him a believer in their lies. Mulder is stunned by the revelation.

Back in the current day, Scully tells FBI officials that she received a phone call from the police department asking her to identify a body inside Mulder's apartment. Struggling to maintain composure, Scully reveals that Mulder died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

@{fg shine}Redux, Part 1 [#97]@{fg text}

In flashback, twenty-four hours before Agent Scully told an FBI assembly that her partner was dead... Mulder receives a tip from Kritschgau that their conversations have been monitored. Mulder looks upward--and notices a small pinhole in the ceiling of his apartment. He races upstairs, where he encounters Scott Ostelhoff, in the apartment directly above his own, igniting flash paper. A struggle ensues, during which a shot rings out.

Mulder tells Scully he killed Ostelhoff. He also informs her that the flash paper Ostelhoff attempted to destroy contained a record of seventeen phone calls placed to the PBX operator at the Bureau. The agents conclude their own agency is behind the cover-up... and that they have been pawns in a conspiratorial game since the very beginning. Mulder suggests they create their own lie in hopes of uncovering the truth.

Shortly thereafter, Scully travels to Mulder's apartment and identifies Ostelhoff's faceless body (the result of the shotgun blast) as that of her partner. Later, during a meeting with Blevins and Skinner, she is instructed to appear before a joint FBI panel. Afterward, Scully traces the phone number listed on Ostelhoff's flash paper to an FBI branch extension that includes Skinner. This leads Scully to conclude that Skinner may be a mole. Meanwhile, the Cigarette-Smoking Man tells the Syndicate he questions reports of Mulder's demise.

Mulder uses Ostelhoff's identification card to infiltrate DARPA, a secret research facility. There he encounters Kritschgau, who explains that the card will give him access to the entire building. Kritschgau then claims the hoax Mulder has been drawn into dates back to the days just after World War II, a time when generals were desperate to continue fueling the nation's economy via a military build-up. In 1947, Kritschgau states, the government began using the Roswell incident as a cover story to distract the American public from the truth-and a top secret program involving DNA. He laments he went along with the lie... until his own son was exposed to bioweapons during the Gulf War. Shortly thereafter, Kritschgau is led away by sentries. Mulder manages to escape detection and make his way deeper into the research complex. He discovers a room containing dozens of alien bodies, identical to the one he discovered at the ice cave-giving credence to Kritschgau's story.

Dr. Vitagliano finishes his examination of the ice core samples given to him by Scully. The cells contained within, he concludes, are the beginnings of a new life form. Scully decides to perform a test that will compare the strange organism to her own DNA. Before she does so, she encounters Skinner, who reveals how a pathology report concluded the body found in Mulder's apartment is not her partner. Later, the DNA test between the samples proves a match. Scully concludes her cancer resulted from being deliberately exposed to the organism.

As Mulder continues his journey through the facility, he discovers a warehouse--a "repository for all the alien-related odds and ends that the Cigarette-Smoking Man has taken from Mulder over the years." There he discovers a gigantic index system, which contains cards for Scully, Kritschgau, and a blank card for Kritschgau, Jr. He also discovers a metallic vial--which could contain a cure for Scully's illness.

Scully appears before the FBI panel and announces she will expose the "mechanism of deception" that drew her partner, and herself, into the government's lies. She then informs the panel that her partner died the previous night of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. As she begins to present scientific evidence that will support her claim, she is suddenly taken ill. Meanwhile, the Cigarette-Smoking Man, working in the shadows, arranges Mulder's escape from the research complex. The Lone Gunmen analyze the contents of the vial... and conclude it contains only deionized water.

@{fg shine}Redux, Part 2 [#98]@{fg text}

A frantic Mulder enters a hospital in search of Scully, who had suddenly collapsed during the FBI hearing. He finds her unconscious body lying in a bed, her breathing aided by a ventilator. Skinner explains that Scully went into shock and is close to death. When Mulder refuses to cooperate with Skinner, he is escorted to the main FBI building, where he is questioned by Section Chief Scott Blevins and a Senior Agent. But Mulder fails to cooperate with the inquiry and leaves the room.

The Cigarette-Smoking Man meets with the Elder and fellow Syndicate member Quiet Willy. The Elder chastises the Cigarette-Smoking Man for allowing Mulder to escape from the research facility, leaving their project vulnerable to exposure. But the Cigarette-Smoking Man counters that Mulder is much more valuable alive, and plots to assure his loyalty. When the Cigarette-Smoking Man leaves the meeting, the Elder tells Quiet Willy he can "proceed." Scully regains consciousness. She tells Mulder that Skinner is the mole operating from within the Bureau. But Mulder counters that Skinner is withholding Ostelhoff's forensics information, casting doubt on the theory. Their conversation is interrupted by Mrs. Scully and Dana's brother, Bill Jr. Bill blames Mulder-and his cause-for his sister's condition. Shortly thereafter, the Cigarette-Smoking Man approaches Mulder. He informs him that the metallic vial contains a tiny microchip that will cure Scully's illness. Later, Bill Jr. voices grave concern about the chip. But Scully tells Dr. Zuckerman she is willing to give it a try. Meanwhile, Kritschgau testifies before the FBI's investigative panel. He denies knowing the identity of Ostelhoff's killer, states that his own son died earlier that day, and reveals that part of his remuneration is funded by a Congressional lobbying firm called Roush.

In an effort to cement Mulder's trust, the Cigarette-Smoking Man arranges a meeting between Mulder and his sister, Samantha. She reveals that, some time after her abduction, she was taken to a hotel room and told that the Cigarette-Smoking Man is her father. Mulder tells Samantha that their mother is still alive... and that she was lied to by the Cigarette-Smoking Man. Her head spinning with confused emotions, Samantha makes her way back to the Cigarette-Smoking Man's car and disappears into the night. Later, the Cigarette-Smoking Man tells Mulder that Kritschgau deceived him with a host of "beautiful lies." He asks Mulder to quit the Bureau and work for him, but Mulder refuses.

While watching a televised Congressional hearing on biotechnology, the Elder notices Skinner lingering in the audience. He instructs a subordinate to "fix" the problem. Blevins informs Mulder that a ballistics test matched the bullet from Ostelhoff's body to Mulder's service revolver. Blevins also claims that Skinner has been working inside the Bureau with a secret agenda. Mulder refuses to believe the story... and refuses to finger Skinner as a mole during his testimony before the FBI panel (even though such testimony would exonerate himself from wrongdoing).

Mulder takes his place before the FBI panel. Simultaneously, Quiet Willy, rifle in hand, positions himself inside a parking garage opposite the Cigarette-Smoking Man's apartment. Before answering questions regarding his culpability in Ostelhoff's death, Mulder announces the name of the mole who has acted from within FBI: Section Chief Scott Blevins. At almost the same moment, Quiet Willy opens fire, shooting the Cigarette-Smoking Man. Blevins makes his way back to his office. There he encounters the Senior Agent, gun in hand. A shot rings out, and Blevins falls to the ground. The Senior Agent then places the weapon in Blevins' own hand. Shortly thereafter, Skinner tells Mulder that the Cigarette-Smoking Man is dead. Though no body was recovered, the massive loss of blood found inside the apartment leaves no other conclusion. During their conversation, Mulder tells Skinner he guessed as to Blevins' identity as a mole. Skinner confirms that Blevins had been working for a biotechnology company called Roush for four years. Mulder then informs Skinner that Scully's cancer has gone into remission.

@{fg shine}Unusual Suspects [#99]@{fg text}

In 1989, a SWAT team storms a darkened warehouse, its floors dotted with pools of blood. There the officers encounter a naked, paranoid Mulder lying on the ground. Suddenly, the three Lone Gunmen-Langly, Frohike and Byers-spring from a hiding place and make an unsuccessful bid for freedom. Byers is questioned by Detective Munch, who explains that despite evidence of a bloody shoot-out, and the involvement of a (now delusional) FBI agent, he has few clues about what actually transpired. Byers recounts the events that led up to the warehouse shoot-out.

As the story unfolds, Byers attends a computer show at a convention center. There he meets a strikingly beautiful woman, "Holly," who claims her psychotic ex-boyfriend kidnapped her daughter. "Holly" gives Byers an Internet address, claiming it is her only hope in locating her child. Byers hacks his way onto government computer, where he types in the name of "Holly's" daughter, Susanne Modeski. The computer opens an encrypted file. Frohike, who mans a nearby booth, agrees to decipher the document.

When "Holly" notices Mulder walking the convention floor, she identifies him as her ex-boyfriend. Frohike and Byers approach Mulder, only to learn he is an FBI Agent. When "Holly" disappears, Frohike and Byers ask Langly to hack onto the FBI mainframe computer, hoping he can find information on Mulder. Langly successfully cracks the mainframe, and learns that "Holly" is actually Susanne Modeski, who is wanted in connection with the bombing of an FBI lab that left four people dead.

Modeski locates the threesome inside Byers' motel room. She claims the information contained in her file is fabricated. She admits the story about her daughter was a lie... one she made up in a desperate attempt to have the encrypted file deciphered. She tells the men that the government is plotting an experiment in which the American public will be exposed to a paranoia-inducing gas-one she unwittingly helped develop.

The encrypted file reveals the address of the warehouse where the paranoia-inducing gas is stored. It also reveals that a surveillance device was attached to Modeski's tooth by her dentist. Using pliers, Modeski extracts a molar containing a tiny transmitter. Byers, Modeski and the others break inside the warehouse. There they discover asthma inhalers containing the gas. Mulder steps forward and announces that everyone is under arrest. Moments later, government officials enter the warehouse and instruct Modeski to follow them. When Mulder orders the men to identify themselves, they open fire, inadvertently striking the asthma inhalers. The liquid rains onto Mulder, triggering a psychotic episode. Modeski shoots the unidentified men and escapes. X steps forward and prepares to kill the threesome execution-style. When X lowers the weapon, Byers realizes he only intended to intimidate them.

When Byers' finishes his story, Munch dismisses it as fiction. Later, the Lone Gunmen are released from jail when Mulder verifies what transpired. Afterward, the threesome locate Susanne at a newspaper office. She laments that no one believes her story. Moments later, government men usher Modeski away.

@{fg shine}Detour [#100]@{fg text}

In a remote section of North Florida, two surveyors, Michael Sloan and Marty Fox, encounter a strange creature with glowing red eyes. Sloan is suddenly yanked downward, disappearing beneath the dense brush. Shortly thereafter, Marty is also attacked. While hunting for possum, twelve-year-old Louis Asekoff and his father discover Marty's abandoned surveyor's transit. Sensing something isn't quite right, the Father sends Louis home with the dog. As the boy runs home, two shotgun blasts echo through the forrest.

Meanwhile, Mulder and Scully ride with agents Michael Kinsley and Carla Stonecypher on a highway stretching through rural Florida. Their destination: an FBI creative team seminar, in which participants are required to use their imagination to perform constructive problem solving exercises (a gathering which Mulder views as a waste of time). The agents' journey comes to a sudden halt when state troopers set up a roadblock on the highway. His spirits lifted by the unexpected diversion, Mulder suddenly exits the vehicle for some detective work. Search and Rescue leader Michele Fazekas tells Mulder that several people are missing, and that a set of tracks found at the scene could not be identified as man nor animal. His interest piqued, Mulder arranges for he and Scully to lodge at a nearby motel... saving himself the torment of attending the teamwork seminar. That night, something sneaks into the Asekoff residence. A terrified Louis tells authorities he was chased by an invisible creature with glowing red eyes. Though the story is dismissed as the product of a young boy's imagination, Mulder discovers a set of tracks inside the house. Mulder tells Fazekas the creature must be found before it can do more harm. Aided by Jeff Glaser, a "tech head" who possesses an infrared tracking device, Fazekas, Mulder and Scully set out in search of the predator. During the journey, Mulder theorizes that the creature is attacking humans in response to encroaching development.

The infrared device detects two creatures in the dense brush, each moving in opposite directions. The group splits up and a chase ensues. Suddenly, Fazekas is yanked downward, and disappears beneath the undergrowth. Mulder realizes that the creatures deliberately separated the group into two units, allowing for easier access to the leader (Fazekas). As the threesome embark on a rescue mission, Mulder recounts an X-File from the early 1950s in which a town in West Virginia was terrorized by primitive-looking men with piercing red eyes. The creatures were dubbed "moth men" by local residents.

Mulder, Scully and Glaser accidentally stray from the marked trail. Their journey is interrupted when the mysterious creatures make another appearance. Guided by directions from Glaser and the infrared device, Mulder ventures deep into the brush. Suddenly, a creature springs from its hiding place. Mulder opens fire, but the creature disappears from view. Shortly thereafter, Glaser separates from the group and he, too, disappears.

While discussing the encounter with Scully, Mulder is suddenly yanked downward. When he resurfaces, like a jack-in-the-box, Scully opens fire, shooting into the bushes nearby. Mulder goes into shock, and Scully does her best to keep him warm as darkness falls. The following morning, as Scully searches for food, she suddenly drops from view. Mulder rushes to her aid<and realizes she fell into a small cave. Inside the chamber, Scully discovers Fazekas and Louis' father, barely breathing and strapped to thick poles. When Scully realizes one of the creatures is nearby, Mulder tosses her his gun. A few moments later, when the second creature approaches, he jumps from his vantage point and lands next to Scully in the cave. One of the creatures rushes the agents. Scully opens fire, striking the predator. The agents move forward for a closer look<and realize their attacker is a man who lived like an animal. Kinsley and Stonecypher arrive and call for help. Mulder notices the words "Ad Noctum," or "into darkness," carved into one of the poles. He points out that Spanish conquistadors carved warnings on posts in the same manner... then notes that Ponce De Leon sought the Fountain of Youth in the area 450 years earlier. He concludes that the predators perceived humans as a threat to their territory, and acted accordingly. Stonecypher notes the creatures would pursue anyone who had entered the woods. Fearing the worst, Mulder suddenly rushes to Scully's motel room. He finds his partner safe and sound, and the pair leave the area. Staring out from beneath Scully's bed, however, is a pair of glowing red eyes.

@{fg shine}Post-Modern Prometheus [#101]@{fg text}

In a rural Indiana neighborhood, Shaineh Berkowitz watches a daytime talk show on television. So entranced is she by the interview, that she fails to notice someone covering the home with termite tenting. A dark figure enters the kitchen and drops a white cake into a skillet, triggering a chemical reaction that produces a gaseous white cloud. Sensing a presence in the house, Shaineh investigates. Suddenly, a horribly disfigured, Frankenstein-like face emerges from the misty darkness. Shaineh gasps in horror.

Later, as the agents drive through the Indiana farmland, Scully reads aloud a letter addressed to Mulder. In it, Shaineh describes how, eighteen-years earlier, a presence entered her smoke-filled bedroom as, strangely, the voice of singer Cher filled the air. Three days later she woke up pregnant with her son, Izzy. Shaineh explains that she saw Mulder on the Jerry Springer show, and hopes he will investigate her case. The agents do, indeed, drive to Shaineh's home. There they discover a comic book bearing the exact likeness of the creature Shaineh claims attacked her. Shaineh explains the monster is called The Great Mutato, a creation of Izzy's fertile imagination. Izzy claims he, and many others in the community, have seen the creature--who apparently has a penchant for peanut butter sandwiches. Izzy and his friends lead the detectives to a wooded area, and using sandwiches for bait, lure the creature from its hiding place. The group gives chase, but the creature disappears into the darkness. Mulder then encounters an Old Man, who claims the real monster is his own son, renowned scientist Dr. Francis Pollidori. The agents visit Pollidori, who describes his experiments in genetic manipulation. He displays a photo of a fruit fly head... with legs growing out of its mouth. Later, Pollidori bids good-bye his wife, Elizabeth, as he embarks on a trip out of town. Moments later, termite tenting falls past Elizabeth's window.

When the agents stop by a country diner in downtown Bloomington, they are feted with heaping plates of food. It turns out that the entire town believes Jerry Springer will do a story on the creature... the result of a newspaper article in which Mulder is quoted as verifying the monster's existence. The agents realize Izzy secretly tape recorded their conversations.

As the agents drive along a country road, Mulder spots Pollidori's tented house. The pair race inside, where they discover Elizabeth's unconscious body. Shortly thereafter, the agents also lose consciousness. The Old Man, Professor Pollidori's father, steps from the smoke, a gas mask covering his face. When the agents regain consciousness, Elizabeth describes her attacker as a hideously deformed man with two mouths.

The Old Man brings the Creature a peanut butter sandwich as it watches the movie Mask, starring Cher, on television. Pollidori confronts his father, and in a rage, strangles him.

A mob of townspeople forms around the local post office as a mail clerk proclaims he's found the monster. He pulls someone wearing a rubber Mutato mask from the back room, then yanks off the mask, exposing Izzy. The postal worker then displays a box he intercepted, which is filled with identical masks.

Records indicate that the residue from the white cakes is a substance used to anesthetize herds of animals. Its use is monitored by the FDA, leading the agents back to the Old Man's farm. When the agents arrive at the scene, a diligent newspaper girl, who had been recording notes about the case, describes how she witnessed the creature burying the Old Man. Shortly thereafter, an angry mob makes its way towards the farm. The agents realize Pollidori killed his father. They befriend the frightened Mutato and attempt to escape, but they are spotted by the mob and retreat into a cellar. Pollidori and the townspeople burst into the basement. There, Pollidori claims the Creature was brought to life by his father. The Creature claims he never harmed another soul. He explains how, 25 years earlier, the Old Man realized his son was conducting secret experiments--of which he (Mutato) was an unfortunate product. The Old Man grew to love the Creature, and then set out to create it a mate. As the Creature continues his tale, the agents, putting together two and two, look around the cellar at the townspeople... one of whom resembles a horse, another a Billy goat and so on. The mob concludes Mutato is not a monster after all. A police cruiser transport Pollidori from the scene. The agents take the Creature into custody, but instead of transporting him to jail, they head for a Memphis nightclub, where Cher sings to Mutato, her biggest fan.

@{fg shine}Christmas Carol [#102]@{fg text}

Scully and her mother travel to Bill Jr.'s house--located at a U.S. naval station in San Diego--several days before the Christmas holiday. There they are greeted by Bill Jr. and his pregnant wife, Tara, who is expected their first child. Not long after her arrival, Scully answers the telephone. On the other end of the line is a woman who sounds exactly like Scully's deceased sister, Melissa. The voice tells Scully, "she needs your help." Unnerved, Scully has the FBI trace the call which, it turns out, was made from the Sim residence. Scully discovers the home is the scene of a criminal investigation. Detective Kresge allows her access to the bathroom, where a dead blonde woman, Mrs. Robert Sim, reclines in a tub full of bloody water, the apparent victim of a suicide. Later, Scully observes the victim's husband, Marshall, and three-year-old Emily Sim. Scully stares at the girl, intrigued by her face. Detective Kresge tells Scully that phone records do indeed indicate that an incoming call was made from the Sim residence to Bill Jr.'s house. But at the same time, there is no record of an outgoing call. Records also indicate the phone had been off the hook for three hours.

Scully tells her mother she's very happy for Bill and Tara... then admits that, as a result of her abduction, she cannot conceive a child of her own. Later that night, Scully experiences a dream in which a young Bill Jr. kills her pet rabbit. During the same dream, she encounters little Emily Sim. Scully is awoken by another call from the mysterious woman. The voice tells Scully to "go to her." The call is again traced to the Sim residence, where Marshall assures Scully that no one used the telephone. From Scully's viewpoint at the front door, she observes two dark-suited men sitting at the kitchen table. The next day, Scully requests--and is given access to--all evidence in the Roberta Sim case. She also phones the FBI and requests the case file on her sister, Melissa. Noting several discrepancies in the file, Scully performs an autopsy on Roberta's body. She discovers a complete absence of medicine tablets inside her stomach. She does, however, notice a puncture wound on the heal of her foot. A search of the Sim house turns up a hypodermic needle in the trash. Marshall claims Emily suffers from anemia and requires daily injections.

Scully tells her mother that a PCR test, which has a sixty-percent accuracy rate, suggests that Emily and Melissa's DNA match (a more comprehensive test will be available in several days). This, and the undeniable physical resemblance between the pair, leads Scully to conclude that Emily is Melissa's daughter. She reminds her mother about a period in 1994 when Melissa's whereabout were unknown... and speculates that she could have given Emily up for adoption. Later, Scully experiences another dream, during which Mrs. Scully gives her the crucifix she wears around her neck. When Scully awakens, Detective Kresge informs her about large bank deposits made by Marshall over the previous eighteen months. The money came from a pharmaceutical company called Prangen Industries. Scully and Kresge interview Dr. Ernest Calderon, who works for the company. He explains that Emily was participating in a clinical trial. When Roberta tried to pull her daughter from the program, the company agreed to send her money as a gesture of good will. Calderon also reveals he prescribed Marshall sumatriptan injections after he complained of migraines. Later, Marshall is arrested for his wife's murder. As a result, Emily is placed in the care of Social Services. Before Emily is driven away, Scully places her gold cross around the girl's neck.

Marshall Sim confesses to the murder. But Scully finds it odd that witnesses had provided him an alibi. She and Kresge drive to the jail, where they find his body hanging from a makeshift noose. Later, Scully tells her brother that the death was made to look like a suicide. Susan Chambliss, a social worker, tells Scully that her application to adopt Emily was rejected. Scully states that the time has come for her to place her personal life ahead of her career. Cambliss promises a review of Scully's final application. On Christmas morning, Scully receives a delivery from an FBI courier. The final DNA test results reveal that Scully is Emily's mother.

@{fg shine}Emily [#103]@{fg text}

Scully has learned she is the biological mother of three-year-old Emily Sim. Scully experiences a nightmare in which she discovers her gold cross lying on the ground as a sandstorm rages around her. Slowly, she, too, transforms into sand and dissolves into nothingness.

Mulder travels to the San Diego County Children's Center, where Scully is keeping an eye on Emily. Scully tells Mulder she needs him to be a witness on her behalf at a child custody hearing. Mulder informs his partner that Frohike accessed the California Social Services Adoption database. It turns out that Emily's mother of record is one Anna Fugazzi (a slang term for "fake"). He warns Scully that the men behind the conspiracy will do anything it takes to protect Emily-including jeopardizing Scully's custody of the girl. During the custody hearing, Mulder introduces a file documenting Scully's disappearance years earlier. He submits that Emily Sim was conceived through a scientific experiment. Despite this, he insists that Scully is nonetheless Emily's mother.

Scully receives another mysterious telephone call. A trace reveals its origin to be the County Children's Center. When the agents arrive at the scene, they discover a thick, fibrous cyst on the back of Emily's neck. As a doctor removes a biopsy sample from the cyst, it suddenly oozes green bubbling fluid. The doctor is overcome by the fumes and treated at the hospital. Afterward, Dr. Calderon refuses to transfer Emily's medical records to the Children's Center. An enraged Mulder physically assaults Calderon and warns that unless he produces the records, he can expect more of the same. Afterward, Calderon approaches the two dark-suited men at the Dimsdale Convalescent home. The men realize Mulder tailed Calderon to the building. They kill Calderon using an alien gimlet, then assume his form. One of the "Dr. Calderons" travels to the Children's Center and injects Emily with a greenish fluid. A surprised Scully chases "Calderon" through the hospital. But by the time she catches up to him, the alien has morphed into the form of a stranger. Mulder and Scully speak by phone. Mulder suspects the fluid injected into Emily will not cause her harm, as the conspirators want her alive... for reasons unknown.

Mulder makes his way inside the Dimsdale Retirement Home. There he discovers evidence that the elderly women residents-including Anna Fugazzi-were all given hormone injections. Frohike uncovers evidence that the elderly women all gave birth only a few years earlier.

Emily continues undergoing therapy and medical tests of all kinds, but her condition only deteriorates further. At one point she is placed inside a pressurized chamber. Suddenly, a snake-like creature stirs beneath her skin. Scully orders an end to the test. Mulder discovers cylinders containing live human embryos floating in a greenish fluid. He grabs three ampules of the greenish fluid and makes his way into a hallway. Detective Kresge suddenly steps forward, placing a gun to Mulder's head. Kresge removes the ampules from Mulder's hand. Suddenly, one of the "Calderons" appears at the end of the hallway. Mulder retrieves one of the ampules and runs off, warning Kresge not to fire on the advancing "Calderon." A confused Kresge shoots nonetheless, and is then overcome by noxious fumes. The alien "Calderon" then morphs into Kresge's form and makes his getaway.

Emily slips into a coma and dies. At the funeral, Scully tells Mulder there is still evidence of what the men did to Emily. But when she lifts the casket lid, she discovers several small sandbags inside (one has spilled its contents onto the bottom of the coffin). Scully retrieves her gold crucifix, the one she gave to Emily, from the sand.

@{fg shine}Kitsunegari [#104]@{fg text}

Inside Lorton Penitentiary, a physical therapist works with Robert Modell, otherwise known as Pusher. An older orderly tells his younger protege, that Modell is extremely dangerous and must never be underestimated. Despite the warning, Modell lures the young orderly into his cell and soon after escapes.

Skinner, Mulder and Scully brief a group of FBI agents and US marshals about the escapee. The group reacts with skepticism when Mulder reveals that Pusher is able to project his will onto others, forcing them to do themselves harm. After the meeting, Scully and Mulder interview the physical therapist, who tells of a nun who visited Modell, as part of a charity group, on the day before his escape.

The ailing Modell makes his way to a sporting goods store, where he eats several high-protein candy bars. He telephones Mulder from the location, and speaks long enough for the call to be traced. The agents rush to the sporting goods store. Mulder notices a man outside the building wearing prison pajamas. But when the man is caught, he turns out to be the sporting goods store employee.

The body of the prosecutor who helped convict Modell is discovered in his upscale home, his entire body covered with cerulean blue paint. Surrounding the body is a Japanese ideogram, repeated hundreds of times. The agents summon a Japanese agent to the scene, who translates the ideogram, kitsunegari, as meaning "fox hunt." Mulder notes a wedding band on the victim's finger. He contacts the real estate agency where Linda Bowman works, and obtains the address where Linda is scheduled to meet a "Fox Mulder." Two police officers are dispatched to the location, but they are fooled by Modell, and one officer "apprehends" his partner. The reason for Modell's interest in Linda remains a mystery. Mulder, Scully and Skinner meet with Linda, who is shaken when notified of her husband's passing. The agents place her in protective custody and transport her to a safe house. Mulder suspects Modell may still be in the general area where the prosecutor's body was discovered. His hunch proves correct: he discovers Modell inside a nearby engineering firm. Mulder draws his weapon, ordering Modell to remain silent. But Modell forces his will onto Mulder and escapes.

Mulder tells Scully that Modell's message was "don't play the game." When Mulder voices his doubts as to Modell's motives--and the possibility he didn't kill Nathan Bowman--Scully begins to suspect her partner was influenced by Modell's will. Later, Mulder again interviews Linda Bowman, hoping to discover a reason for Modell's interest in her. He reacts with mild surprise when Linda reveals she had only been married to Nathan for a little over two months. During the conversation, Mulder cannot help but notice subtle clues in Linda's words, such as "brush with greatness" and "paint him." He concludes that it was Linda who killed her husband, not Modell. Believing Mulder is under Modell's influence, Skinner demands his service weapon and instructs him to go home.

Mulder suspects that the nun who visited Modell in prison was, in fact, Linda. He returns to the prison, hoping the therapist will verify his theory. But before the therapist can positively identify Linda, she receives a phone call from someone who "wills" her to commit suicide. Mulder phones Scully, and tells her it was Linda, not Modell, who made the call. Modell possesses the mind of a police officer, who transports him to the safe house where Linda is under constant guard. Modell finds Linda and places a gentle hand upon her face. Skinner spots Modell and draws his weapon. Modell tricks Skinner into believing he is holding a revolver, drawing his fire. A badly wounded Modell is transported to a hospital.

Mulder tells Scully that Modell pretended to have a gun to "take the fall" for Linda. But his theory does not explain the motive for his action. Mulder travels to the hospital, hoping to speak with Modell should he regain consciousness. But Linda uses mind control to slip past Mulder, making him believe she is a nurse. When Modell does regain consciousness, Linda wills his heart to stop beating. Mulder discovers an index card dropped by Linda. On the reverse is an address for a commercial building. Mulder travels to the structure, where he finds Scully waiting within. Scully claims Linda is inside the building, and is using mind control to act against her will. Scully raises her weapon and places it against her own temple--firing a shot. Scully's lifeless body falls to the floor. A few moments later, Linda walks into the room, a gun in her hand. Mulder grabs the revolver from Scully's hand and aims at Linda. But Linda claims she is Scully... and that the real Linda is standing right behind him. "Linda" suddenly aims her gun slightly to the left of Mulder and opens fire. Mulder turns to see Linda's body behind him. Linda is transported to a hospital Later, Scully and Mulder learn that Linda and Modell were fraternal twins.

In Coats Grove, Michigan, Bobby Rich, a sixteen--year--old boy, is berated by his stepfather, Phil, for not finishing his lawn work outside the house. Bobby picks up a shovel and instructs his stepfather to keep his distance. As the dispute escalates, Bobby drops the shovel and runs into a nearby orchard. Phil gives chase. Suddenly, Phil's feet are knocked out from underneath him. A short time later, Phil's wife, Patti, makes her way through the darkened orchard. She discovers Phil's body buried in mud up to his shoulders, with mud seeping from his nose and mouth. Kneeling beside Phil is Bobby, his eyes wide with terror.

Scully performs an autopsy on Phil's corpse. She discovers over twelve pounds of mud in his stomach. Her conclusion: Phil's head was forcibly held in the mud, mostly likely by his son, Bobby. She hypothesizes that Bobby may have dug the pit that trapped Phil, and, noting a rope--like bruise on Phil's ankle, speculates that Bobby may have had help from an accomplice. Mulder interviews Bobby, who claims his father enjoyed physically abusing him. Later, Patti tells Scully that, from her point of view, it appeared as if Bobby was attempting to help Phil out of the muddy orchard pit, not cause him harm. She also reveals that her son has been undergoing therapy for his anger since 1995. Later, the agents meet with Bobby's therapist, Karin Matthews. She describes Bobby as the victim of physical abuse. But Mulder expresses his belief that Bobby may not be to blame for his stepfather's death.

Bobby tells a pretty fellow student, Lisa Baiocchi, that she must stand up to her father< just as he had done with Phil. When Lisa returns home, her angry father demands that she stop seeing Bobby. An angry Lisa storms off to her room. Shortly thereafter, a window explodes, and a shadowy, arm--like appendage grabs Mr. Baiocchi by the throat. His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house. Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out the window, Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out the second story window. Later, the agents learn that Lisa is also one of Karin Matthews' patients. Karin tells Mulder her approach with victims of abuse is to encourage them to empower themselves<to confront and stand up against their abuser.

With the aid of a town coroner, Mulder a small splinter of fresh wood embedded in Mr. Baiocchi's neck. Mulder matches the fragment to the living tree outside the Baiocchi home. A short time later, the agents are approached by a man named Ramirez, who holds an axe at his side. He tells the agents that the trees are all dying because of a "bad man." Karin invites Lisa to stay at her home until her aunt can pick her up the following day. As Lisa listens from her bedroom, she overhears an argument between Karin and a male voice. A curious Lisa makes her way to the root cellar, where she discovers the body of a man. Terrified, Lisa turns towards the door, only to hear it slam shut. A dead bolt turns, locking her within. She hears the unidentified man's voice refer to her as "a snoop." Later, Karin tells the trapped Lisa she must remain quiet, or the unidentified man will hear her voice.

Mulder discovers that Karin's father was pulled from the mud of an orchard twenty years earlier. He finds it strange that Karin failed to mention the coincidence. Ramirez tells Mulder that Karin Matthew's father's death brought about an end of a blight affecting the trees. Karin attributes the tale to her father's stature, believing powerful men inspire fantasy. Later, Mulder digs up Mr. Matthews' casket... and finds it empty, save for roots. When Lisa's aunt, Linda, arrives at Karin's house, Karin informs her that Lisa left for a bus station. Before Linda drives off, Lisa smashes the glass of a window in the basement. Linda rushes to her niece's aid, but she is attacked and killed by an unseen force as tree branches sway in the wind above her. Later, Bobby tells Mulder that, as part of therapy, Karin made him pretend he was Phil... and that, all along, he was never a really a victim.

Lisa hears the cellar door bolt slide. She stands up... only to realize the unidentified male voice has been coming from Karin all along. Scully and Mulder search Karin's house, where they come upon the corpse Lisa discovered earlier in the root cellar. Mulder concludes the body is that of Karin's father. Karin locks the agents in the root cellar, but Mulder forces it open. They find Lisa frightened but unharmed in a corner of the kitchen. Mulder attempts to pursue an escaping Karin, but his car crashes into an enormous tree. Karin drives to the Rich residence, where she chases Bobby into the orchard. Suddenly, Bobby is dragged downward into the mud. While attempting to rescue the teenager, Mulder simultaneously encourages Karin to break the cycle... to fight the voice inside her head. But Karin is unable. A tendon-like root snakes out of the mud and drags Mulder downward. Ramirez appears, axe in hand, and strikes Karin, killing her. Mulder and Bobby are released by the unseen force.

@{fg shine}Chinga [#106]@{fg text}

In Amma Beach, Maine, five-year-old Polly Turner accompanies her pretty mother, Melissa, to the grocery market. Polly sits in the child-carrier seat of a shopping cart, clutching a doll, Chinga. As Melissa strolls the isles, she attracts the attention of Dave the Fishmonger. Polly notices Dave, and tells her mother she doesn't like the store. Melissa responds by quickly pushing the cart into another area of the market. As Melissa strolls down the frozen food section, she comes upon the image of Dave, reflected in the glass of a cabinet, a knife protruding from one eye. A horrified Melissa tells Polly they are going home. But as Melissa makes her way towards the store's exit, customers begin clawing at their eyes. Back in the butcher section, Dave's attention is diverted by the shape of a large Chinga doll, as reflected in a metal door. Dave grabs a knife from his belt... but suddenly turns it on himself.

Vacationing in Maine, Scully turns her rental car into the grocery market parking lot. An Old Man exits the store and tells Scully that a doctor is needed. Inside the store, observes Dave, a knife protruding from his eye. She telephones Mulder and describes the bizarre situation. Mulder tells his partner the event might be the result of witchcraft or sorcery. Scully, however, can find no physical evidence that might support this theory.

Assisted by Police Chief Jack Bonsaint, and his deputy, Buddy Riggs, Scully reviews security camera footage of the event. She notices Melissa Turner rushing towards the exit, the only customer unaffected. Bonsaint tells Scully that some townspeople believe Melissa is a witch. Buddy Riggs telephones Melissa with news that Bonsaint will be questioning her about the occurrence at the super market. Riggs promises to help Melissa, but she warns him to stay away. In the background, unseen by Melissa, looms the shadow of the large Chinga doll.

Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa's home, but find it unoccupied. Bonsaint tells Scully that Melissa had married a fisherman, but was widowed when the husband was killed in a boating accident. Bonsaint explains that there had been an incident between Polly and the proprietor of a daycare center, Jane Froelich. It seems that Jane slapped Polly when she became uncontrollable. Shortly thereafter, Jane claims she was thrown to the ground. Bonsaint, however, believes the little girl never touched Jane. Bonsaint then tells Scully that Dave the Butcher's interest in Melissa was unrequited.

Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop. Melissa describes how she has seen images of violent deaths, such as Dave's, before they occur. Riggs give Melissa the key to a remote cabin and suggests she leave town. Meanwhile, Polly grows upset when a girl clerk does not meet her demand for more cherries. Shortly thereafter, the clerk's pony tail gets caught in an ice cream machine. Riggs jumps the counter and rescues the girl.

Scully and Bonsaint pay Jane Froelich a visit. Froelich claims Melissa is the descendant of witches--and she is passing her cursed lineage to Polly. Later, while speaking with an official at a ranger station (near Riggs' remote camp), Melissa experiences another vision, this time seeing Froelich's bloody image reflected in the rear window of the car. Melissa turns the car around and heads back home. Meanwhile, Froelich hears the song "Hokey Pokey" emanating from the day care center. She makes her way through the darkness... and comes upon the big Chinga doll. She picks up a piece of broken phonograph record, but instead of using it as a defensive weapon, turns it upon herself. Later, Melissa experiences another vision... this time seeing Riggs' corpse. Riggs finds Melissa at home, and convinced she had something to do with Froelich's murder, insists she accompany him to the police station. Later, Riggs' body lies on the kitchen floor, his nightstick covered with blood.

Scully recognizes the Old Man from the supermarket aboard the boat where Melissa's husband was killed. The Old Man tells Scully the story of how Rich Turner came upon the Chinga doll while checking lobster traps. Rich intended to give the doll to his daughter, but several days later the Old Man found Rich's body, a grappling hook through his skull.

Melissa begins nailing shut every door and window in the house. Polly tells her mother she cannot sleep, and Melissa promises the noise will stop. Moments later, Melissa sees a bloodied reflection of herself in a window, a hammer buried in her skull. Scully and Bonsaint drive to the Turner home. Scully, peering through the windows, discovers Melissa attempting to set fire to Riggs' body. Bonsaint breaks down the door as Melissa runs to a closet and grabs hold of a hammer--which she turns upon herself. Thinking quickly, Scully grabs the Chinga doll and throws it inside a microwave oven in the kitchen. As the doll melts, Melissa drops the hammer and regains her senses. Later, another lobster fisherman pulls a trap from the water... and discovers the burned Chinga doll inside. Suddenly, its eyes open.

@{fg shine}Kill Switch [#107]@{fg text}

Several heavily-armed crack dealers receive an anonymous telephone call alerting them to the whereabouts of a hated enemy. The men all converge on a diner, but none find their target. Two deputy marshals receive a similar anonymous tip, alerting them about a Colombian fugitive in the same diner. The marshals enter the diner and order everyone onto the floor. Drug dealers draw their weapons and a fierce gun battle ensues.

As the agents observe the aftermath of the shoot-out, Mulder pulls a tarp off the face of Donald Gelman, one of the co-inventors of the Internet. Gelman had been working at his laptop inside the diner when the shooting broke out and became trapped in the cross-fire. Mulder sneaks Gelman's laptop under his jacket and brings it back to Scully's car. He finds a blank CD in the laptop drive, which when placed inside Scully's CD-player emits music from The Platters' Twilight Time. Puzzled, Mulder brings the CD to the Lone Gunmen for further analysis. When they are unable to crack the disc's security code, Scully suggests they check Gelman's e-mail log. They find a message containing a standard ID number for a shipping container. The message is signed by someone named Invisigoth.

The agents track the number to a container yard. A figure springs from the darkness, zaps Mulder with a stun-gun, and runs off into the night. Scully apprehends the suspect, Esther Nairn, a gorgeous young woman with a nose ring, and escorts her back to the container, which is brimming with sophisticated computer equipment. Esther's attention is diverted to one of the monitors. She tells the agents that an armed Department of Defense satellite has locked onto their location. Despite the farfetchedness of the tale, Mulder convinces Scully they must leave the area immediately. Shortly thereafter, a strange green light descends from the heavens and destroys the shipping container.

Mulder concludes that Donald Gelman realized his lifelong dream: the construction of a sentient artificial intelligence, a computer program with its own consciousness. Esther confirms Mulder's suspicion, describing how Gelman unleashed the program onto the Internet so it could evolve--much like the primordial slime from which mankind evolved. She tells the agents that the AI monitors all communication, and will destroy her the moment it locks onto her location. Esther also reveals that Gelman was in the process of creating a special virus program, nicknamed "Kill Switch," that would hunt down and destroy the rogue system. Instead of simply destroying Gelman with a laser from above, Esther is convinced it killed its creator with a dozen crack dealers in an effort to show off its sense of humor. She also believes the virus is holed up on a computer somewhere--and the only way to kill it is to find and destroy its safe house.

By accessing government files, Mulder locates a suspicious T3 line, one that would be needed by the AI to access the Internet. He traces the cable to an abandoned farm on which sits a trailer. Meanwhile, Esther gets the jump on Scully and forces her at gun point to drive to an isolated location where she hopes to find one of her colleagues, a man named David Markham. Esther exits the car and begins crying at the site of a demolished house. During her absence, Scully manages to unshackle her handcuffs. Esther gives Scully back her gun and asks her to "put her out of her misery." Esther then admits to Scully that she and David had planned to download their consciousness and enter the AI. But Gelman forbade the idea.

Mulder gains access to the trailer housing the T3 line. Inside he discovers David Markham's body, his face concealed by a virtual reality mask. Suddenly, several crab-like droids spring from the jungle of cables and constrain Mulder. Mulder experiences strange visions involving nurses in a 1940s hospital who threaten to amputate him, limb by limb, unless he reveals the location of Kill Switch. Meanwhile, the AI pinpoints Scully and Esther in their car near a turntable drawbridge. The pair become trapped and, at Scully's urging, Esther tosses the laptop into the water. Moments later, a green laser blasts the water.

Scully and Esther climb into the trailer where Mulder is bound by the crab-droids. Several of the robotic creatures attack, and Scully dispatches them with her revolver. Scully finds Mulder, his head encased in the virtual reality mask (the source of his strange visions). Esther produces the CD, and Scully gives the AI what it wants, inserting the disk into a drive. The AI releases Mulder, and Scully drags him outside. Esther accesses a keyboard and instructs the satellite to lock onto the trailer's coordinates. When Scully reenters the trailer, she finds Esther wearing the virtual reality helmet, the body of her beloved David nearby. Scully races from the trailer, and Esther instructs the AI to upload. Moments later, the green laser destroys the trailer. When Mulder recovers, he tells Scully that Esther's consciousness may have joined the AI.

@{fg shine}Bad Blood [#108]@{fg text}

A dark figure chases a terrified teenage boy, Ronnie Strickland, through a field in Texas. When Ronnie trips and falls, the figure pulls out a wooden stake and plunges it through his chest. Scully's voice calls out, and when the figure turns, we see that it is Agent Mulder. Pulling open the teenager's mouth, Mulder shows Scully two sharp incisors, much like vampire fangs. Upon closer examination, Scully determines the fangs are, in fact, a set of fake plastic teeth. Mulder realizes he has made a most egregious error.

When the agents return to their offices, they agree to discuss the events that led up to the killing before they speak with Skinner (as they both face potential prison sentences). Scully recounts her story first. As the tale unfolds, Mulder and Scully examine slides of dead cattle, the victims of a series of exsanguinations in a small Texas town. Mulder reveals that a vacationer from New Jersey, Mr. Funt, met the same fate, and authorities located two small puncture marks on his neck. The agents fly to Texas, where they meet with Sheriff Hartwell, a handsome man who immediately catches Scully's attention. With Hartwell's permission, the agents examine the victim's body. Mulder notices that Funt's shoes are untied, but is unsure of the clue's meaning. While he and the sheriff stake out a local cemetery, Scully performs an autopsy on the corpse. Later that night, Scully and Mulder regroup at their motel to discuss their findings. Scully reveals that the victim was drugged with chloral hydrate, more commonly referred to as knockout drops. Scully believes someone doped Funt and then withdrew his blood using a syringe, perhaps emulating vampires seen in the movies. Mulder then reveals that there has been another victim. As a tired Scully sets out to perform yet another autopsy, Ronnie the Pizza Guy (the same teenager Mulder staked in the opening teaser) shows up with a delivery. Scully tells the teenager to deliver the pizza to Mulder as she heads for her car in the motel parking lot.

During the second autopsy, Scully realizes that both victims consumed pizza as their last meal. She races back to the motel, where she finds a drugged Mulder lying on the floor. The pizza guy springs into view, prompting Scully to fire several rounds. This concludes Scully's version of events that led up to the teenager's death. Mulder, however, disagrees with Scully's details, and tells his version of the story.

As Mulder's version unfolds, it becomes clear that he is painting himself in a good-natured light, while Scully is depicted as being suspicious of his every word. After examining slides of the dead cows, the agents fly to Texas, where Scully finds herself attracted to Sheriff Hartwell. In Mulder's version, however, Hartwell is affected with large buck teeth and a substantial loss of I.Q. The agents split up: Scully performs the first autopsy, while Mulder and Sheriff Hartwell stake out the cemetery. While surveilling the cemetery, Mulder begins pouring sunflower seeds on the ground, explaining that vampires are obsessive-compulsive. Should a vampire appear, it would have to pick up the seeds--just like it would have to untie shoelaces. The sheriff is dispatched to investigate a disturbance at an RV park. Mulder tags along. There, the pair discover the body of the second victim. Tired and frustrated, Mulder returns to the motel, where he regroups with Scully. He informs his partner of the need for a new autopsy, and after Scully leaves, he accepts the pizza delivery from Ronnie. Later, he finds himself in a drug-induced stupor. Ronnie enters the motel room, his fangs exposed, his eyes glowing red. Thinking quickly, Mulder manages to throw sunflower seeds onto the floor. Unable to resist the obsessive-compulsive disorder, Ronnie drops to his knees and begins picking them up. Scully finishes the second autopsy, and realizing Mulder is in danger, races to the motel. She draws her weapon and fires, striking Ronnie right in the chest. Though still in a drug-induced haze, Mulder gives chase, eventually staking Ronnie.

Back in the present, a coroner inadvertently reanimates Ronnie's corpse by removing the stake. Skinner informs the agents of the new development, and the pair fly back to Texas. There, the pair meet up with Sheriff Hartwell. As Scully and the sheriff stake out the cemetery, Mulder makes his way to the RV park, certain it contains Ronnie's resting place.

Sheriff Hartwell, it turns out, is a vampire. He drugs Scully's coffee, and she passes out. Meanwhile, Mulder discovers Ronnie's coffin inside an RV. Using handcuffs, he traps the vampire inside the box. When the vehicle is surrounded by the undead, Mulder uses two pizza breadsticks to form a cross. The vampires shrug off the cross and pull Mulder downward. The next morning, a groggy Scully finds an unconscious Mulder inside his rental car. Mulder awakens--only to discover that the RV lot is now completely empty. The agents recount their bizarre tale to Skinner... who can only stare back at them.

@{fg shine}Patient X [#109]@{fg text}

In Kazakhstan, former Soviet Union, two teenage boys watch as a UFO disappears behind a mountain top. The boys run off to tell their families, but as they sprint through the woods, they come upon an area filled with burning automobiles. A screaming man, his body ablaze, appears out of the dense smoke, causing the boys to run. One of them, Dmitri, takes refuge in the woods. The next morning, he is discovered by Krycek, who is in the company of a unit of Russian soldiers. With the boy in custody, Krycek and his men approach Maria Covarrubias, who, along with U.N. troops, is sifting through the burned out wreckage. Krycek tells Maria he knows who she works for--and to tell her superiors he has a witness (Dmitri).

Back in the United States, Mulder takes part in a visiting lecturers forum. He disagrees with the opinions voiced by his fellow panelists regarding a woman referred to as "Patient X," an apparent abductee who seeks answers as to why aliens are on Earth. Mulder maintains that there is no complicity between the military and alien abductions. Instead, he believes the government is developing biological warfare and hiding the fact by concocting stories about "little green men." When the discussion ends, Mulder is approached by Dr. Werber, the man who performed regression hypnosis on him five years earlier (leading Mulder to believe his sister was abducted). Werber reveals that he is Patient X's doctor. He arranges a meeting between Mulder and the woman, Cassandra, believing that she will change his mind regarding his new theory. Cassandra believes the aliens are on Earth to deliver a message. But something, she fears, has gone wrong.

Krycek extracts information from Dmitri by subjecting him to a beating. He then orders a Russian doctor to expose the teenager to the alien black oil. The liquid enters Dmitri's body through his mouth and nose. Dmitri, his eyes and mouth sewn shut, is then transported back to the US on a Russian freighter. Meanwhile, Covarrubias briefs Syndicate members on the mysterious burn site in Kazakhstan. Covarrubias believes the act was aimed at the Syndicate, and reveals that Krycek captured a witness at the site. Krycek phones the group and offers to trade Dmitri for all research information pertaining to a vaccine against the black oil.

At the FBI building, Scully is approached by Agent Spender, who identifies himself as Cassandra's son. Spender tells Scully that his mother is a very disturbed woman. Later, Scully tells Mulder about the conversation. She then peruses Cassandra's medical file, growing intrigued when she realizes Cassandra claims to have been abducted at Skyland Mountain, the same site where Scully was taken by Duane Barry. The file also reveals that Cassandra has an implant in the base of her neck. Mulder brushes off the findings, agreeing with Spender's conclusion. But so intrigued is Scully by the developments that she pays Cassandra a visit at the psychiatric hospital. There, she grows unnerved when Cassandra tells her that some nights she awakens feeling as though she must be somewhere, but not knowing where to go.

Meanwhile, a group of abductees gather at Skyland Mountain. As an Unknown Man drives down the mountain road, he encounters faceless men chasing another man. One of the faceless men drives a metallic wand into the Running Man's back, setting him ablaze. Later, Mulder and Scully inspect the site. The situation forces Scully in the opposite position she would normally take, for despite a lack of evidence, she believes the event is linked to her abduction. The agents are contacted by Cassandra, who warns "they" must be stopped. The agents are then approached by Spender, who explains that his mother was part of a UFO cult.

Back at the Syndicate office, group members conclude that the latest burning is aimed at sabotaging their work. Quiet Willy is dispatched to deal with the situation. Meanwhile, Covarrubias rendezvous with Krycek at the freighter, which is docked in New York Harbor. The two share a hungry kiss, then exit so they can be alone. When Krycek returns, Dmitri has vanished. The Well-Manicured Man appears, demanding to know where the boy has gone.

After examining the evidence, Mulder concludes the victims of the mass burning were led to Skyland Mountain by the government when it triggered the implant devices. But he is at a loss to explain why they were killed. Their conversation is interrupted by a call from Covarrubias, who informs Mulder of the similar incident in former Soviet Union, and of the witness, Dmitri. Suddenly, the black oil oozes from Dmitri, and Covarrubias drops the phone.

Scully suffers an attack--not unlike the one Cassandra described earlier. She travels to Ruskin Dam, where a throng of people have gathered, including Cassandra, in the company of Quiet Willy, and Dmitri, the stitches having been torn from his eyes and mouth. A glowing ship passes overhead and disappears over adjacent treetops. Suddenly, screams are heard from the far edge of the congregation, where faceless men wielding alien weapons set people ablaze.

@{fg shine}The Red and the Black [#110]@{fg text}

A man, his face unseen, types a letter to his son (whose identity is unknown). The man, who lives in a remote cabin, addresses the letter to the FBI and pays a boy to mail it.

Meanwhile, rescue workers sift through the area near the dam where blackened bodies lie along the length of a bridge. Amongst the bodies is Quiet Willy, the Syndicate's hit man. Skinner directs Mulder to a nearby provisional tent, where Scully is ministered by medics. Nearby is the body of Dmitri, the Russian boy, his exposed skin blackened by the fire. When Scully regains consciousness, she tells Mulder she has no memory of what occurred at the dam. Outside of Scully's room, Spender tells Mulder that rescue workers were unable to locate his mother, Cassandra.

The Well-Manicured Man and a physician, Dr. Bronschweig, tend to Maria Covarrubias inside a hospital quarantine room. Later, the Well-Manicured Man speaks with Krycek, imprisoned aboard the Russian freighter. The Well-Manicured Man is aware that Krycek deliberately exposed Dmitri to the black oil to insure the infection of anyone who attempted to ascertain what he knows about the burnings in Russia. He also believes that Krycek possesses a vaccine, that would create resistance to the alien colonists. The Well-Manicured Man offers Krycek freedom in return for the vaccine.

Meanwhile, a spacecraft crashes at Fort Wiekamp Air Force Base. A faceless alien pirate drags one of his comrades from the wreckage. Later, members of the Syndicate study photographs of the alien. They realize the man is a resistance fighter, a member of an ongoing battle against alien colonists. The Well-Manicured Man explains that Krycek gave him the vaccine, meaning resistance may, in fact, be a possibility. But the Elder concludes that the captured fighter should be turned over to the colonists, the Well-Manicured Man has Covarrubias injected with the vaccine to ensure it actually works.

Back at the hospital, Mulder tells Scully that x-rays have revealed the presence of implants inside the people who were at the dam. Mulder recounts his belief that the U.S. government manufactured and implanted the chip as part of a bio-chemical weapons project. Scully agrees to be hypnotized by Dr. Werber in an effort to recall what happened at the dam. In a trance-like state, Scully recalls how a UFO flew overhead, and shortly thereafter, how the faceless aliens set congregants on fire. Then another craft appeared overhead, which began attacking the faceless men. Cassandra was then pulled upward, out of her wheelchair, by the ship. Afterward, Werber tells Mulder that the same event will happen yet again.

Skinner reviews an audio tape of Werber's session with Scully. Mulder tells Skinner the entire event was staged to cover up a classified military project. Skinner admits, however, that Scully's UFO scenario is more plausible. Meanwhile, when Covarrubias fails to respond to the vaccine, the Elder informs the Well-Manicured Man that the captured alien is being turned over to the colonists.

Spender shows the agents a videotape of himself, as a young boy, answering questions while under hypnosis. As the tape plays, the young Spender describes his abduction by a UFO. Spender then pauses the tape. He tells the agents the story is untrue, a falsehood told to him by his mother many times. He maintains that Dr. Werber's regression memory theory is without merit. Spender also points out that Mulder has expressed his UFO theories to Scully many times... suggesting that she has recounted the information in a similar manner.

Krycek surprised Mulder inside his apartment. He explains that Kazakhstan, Skyland Mountain and the site in Pennsylvania are all beacons for colonization. The burnings, Krycek explains, were the work of alien rebels attempting to foil the colonist's plans for takeover. Krycek gives Mulder the location of the captured alien rebel. He maintains that if the captive perishes, so does the resistance. Accompanied by Scully, Mulder drives to Fort Wiekamp. As they attempt to bluff their way through the front gate, the agents notice Quiet Willy at the wheel of a military truck as it is about to exit the base. As the vehicle pulls away, Mulder sneaks aboard the cargo area. There he finds faceless alien pirate imprisoned inside. Quiet Willy brings the rig to a stop... then morphs into the alien bounty hunter. He climbs into the cargo area, but shortly thereafter, a white light illuminates the truck. A second faceless alien, armed with a firestarter weapon, enters. Mulder opens fire. Shortly thereafter, a confused Mulder is swarmed by MPs and placed inside a car with Scully. Mulder has no memory of how he got aboard the truck. Meanwhile, the envelope seen in the opening teaser is delivered to Spender. Several days later, back at the cabin, the envelope, labeled with the words "return to sender," is delivered to the Cigarette-Smoking Man.

In the year 1990, a sheriff escorts a landlord into a boarded-up, dilapidated house for the purpose of evicting the tenant, Edward Skur. Once inside, the pair smell a terrible odor, then discover a human body, collapsed, as if all of the internal organs have been removed. A figure springs from the shadows and the sheriff opens fire. The attacker, an elderly man, falls to the ground, mortally wounded. His last words are, "Mulder... Mulder."

FBI Agent Mulder, still a year away from working on the X-Files, pays a visit to a man named Arthur Dales. Mulder questions Dales, a former special agent with the Bureau, about his work on an unsolved case from 1952... one focusing on Edward Skur (the attacker from the opening teaser). According to the censored report, Skur disappeared 38 years earlier before he could be arrested for a series of killings in which the victims' internal organs were removed. When Mulder utters his own last name, a flash of recognition passes on Dales' face. Dales makes cryptic reference to HUAC, and the communist witch hunts of the 1950s, prompting Mulder to review newsreel footage of the McCarthy hearings. While watching the tape, Mulder notices his own father sitting amidst McCarthy's group. When Mulder returns to Dales' apartment, Dales elaborates on Skur, who, years earlier, was labeled a communist.

The story flashes back to 1952. A young Ed Skur is arrested by FBI agents Dales and Michel, and charged with contempt of Congress for failing to appear before the committee. That night, Dales relaxes at a bar called the Hoot Owl. He receives a phone call from his partner, informing him that Skur hanged himself inside his jail cell. Dales travels back to the Skur residence to inform the family of the death. But before he exits his car, he sees Skur walking down the street. An incredulous Dales gives chase. A struggle ensues, during which black tendrils creep out of Skur's mouth. The fight attracts attention, and Skur runs off.

Dales files a report about the farfetched incident. Shortly thereafter, he is summoned to the office of Special Assistant Roy Cohn. Cohn tells Dales to amend the report by removing any reference to Skur. Dales does as he is told. A short time later, he and Michel are dispatched to a homicide. They discover the body of a dead German doctor, his body flattened. Dales notices a coaster from the Hoot Owl, on the back of which is a message: "come alone." That night at the bar, Dales is approached by a young Bill Mulder. He explains that it was he who summoned the agents to the doctor's home. He confirms that Skur is the perpetrator. He also explains that Skur is not a communist, but a patriot. Skur, along with two other men, Gissing and Oberman, worked for the State Department. Gissing and Oberman both took their own lives. Skur was arrested, and his death faked, so that the government could cover-up what it had done to him. Bill Mulder wants the truth to be known, explaining that Skur was a colleague. But he warns that Skur believes that Dales and Michel are part of the conspiracy against him. Shortly thereafter, Skur attacks Michel. A spider-like creature crawls from Skur's mouth and enters Michel.

Cohn orders that Michel's body be transported to Bethesda instead of allowing a county coroner to perform the autopsy. Dales protestsuntil Cohn threatens to label him a communist. When Dales returns to the Bureau, he notices a heavily-censored document on the desk of Dorothy Bahnsen, a clerk. Dorothy explains that the document is a deposition that branded Skur and his co-workers communists. She then states that she recognized one of the men named in the document from an X-File. She explains that an X-File pertains to unsolved casesand that only the director's office decides which file is designated with the "X." She pulls out the file on the man whose named she recognized. It belongs to a German ZmigrZ, Dr. Strohman. Dales recognizes Strohman as the man found inside the house. Dales tracks down Gissing's body and supervises an autopsy. Inside the corpse is a cocoon containing a spider-like creature, which Dales kills. Later, Dales informs Mrs. Skur that her husband, along with two co-workers, was tricked by the government. He elaborates, explaining that all three men underwent surgery for treatment of war injuries, but, in reality, received an operation called xenotransplantationthe grafting of a species into the human body. That night, Bill Mulder and Cohn's assistant escort Dales to the bar where he is scheduled to meet Skur. Dales is equipped with a hidden microphone and told that Skur will be arrested the moment his guard is lowered. Later, Skur enters the empty bar. He tells Dales the other men will not be coming, explaining that they assumed he (Skur) would kill him.

Dales sees the logic of Skur's words. A struggle ensues, during which Dales is able to handcuff Skur to the bar. Back in 1990, Dales finishes telling his story to Mulder. But the puzzle still remains: why did Skur die saying the name of Mulder's father? The story then flashes back to 1952... when a young Bill Mulder stopped on a road and gave Skur the keys to his handcuffs.

@{fg shine}Mind's Eye [#112]@{fg text}

As Marty Glenn, a twenty-something woman, moves about her apartment, she suddenly experiences an internal vision. As she watches, horrorstruck, a murderer, switchblade in hand, advances on a another man standing before a bathroom sink. A short time later, police are summoned to a motel, where the body of the murderer's victim lies on the bathroom floor. Marty, a bloody sponge clutched in her hand, is discovered hiding in the shower. As the officers place Marty into handcuffs, they realize she is blind.

Scully and Mulder meet with Wilmington Homicide Detective Lloyd Pennock, who has been assigned the murder case. Pennock explains that, under normal circumstances, Marty would have been charged with the murder. But since Marty has been blind since birth, he is at a loss as to how--or why--she managed to kill the heroin dealer, Paco Ordonez. Pennock states that he has 48 hours to prove to the District Attorney that his suspect possesses a kind of "sixth sense"... or wait until she kills someone else.

The detectives meet with Marty inside her jail cell. During questioning, it becomes obvious that Marty--who has adopted an uncooperative attitude--possesses knowledge that only the murderer should know. As Mulder stays behind to supervise Marty's polygraph test, Scully visits the scene of the crime. There she discovers a bloody leather glove hidden behind the bathroom mirror. Meanwhile, by phrasing a question in a certain manner, Mulder determines that Marty did somehow manage to witness the murder.

Marty experiences another internal vision. This time, the killer makes advances on a sexy woman, Susan Forester, who sits at a bar. Marty notices the name of the bar reflected in a mirror. She requests that she be allowed to make a phone call from jail. By using an information operator, Marty phones the bar and makes contact with the murderer, a man named Gotts. She warns him to leave the woman alone.

Scully brings the bloody glove to the jail. She informs Marty that her fingerprints were located on the glove, and perhaps even more importantly, the glove fits Marty perfectly. Pennock concludes that Marty is the murderer. Mulder, however, is plagued with doubt. Scully offers a possible explanation: Marty may not be blind. Scully expands upon this theory, noting disorders that would permit sight on a subconscious level. As Marty undergoes an eye exam, she is suddenly struck by another internal vision. Mulder notes a reaction on a measurement mode screen used by the opthamologist. But Marty refuses to explain what she saw. Though the examiner concludes that Marty is completely blind, Mulder tells Pennock and the District Attorney that there is evidence of neurological activity which caused her pupils to dilate--perhaps a physical response to images in the mind's eye. The District Attorney concludes that it is unlikely her office could convict a blind woman based on fingerprints alone. As a result, Marty is released from custody.

As Marty makes her way through the city, she is struck by another vision. This time, she witnesses Gotts attack the sexy woman from the bar. With some help from a passerby, Marty makes her way to the alley where the attack occurred. She discovers the woman's body inside a dumpster. Marty then returns to the police station and confesses to both murders.

Marty supplies Pennock with the location of a locker that contains a briefcase filled with Gotts' heroin. Meanwhile, a lab test reveals that neither of the stains found on the leather glove match Marty's blood type, bolstering Mulder's suspicion that Marty is innocent. So confident is Mulder that he approaches Marty directly. He tells her he discovered the original police report detailing her mother's murder--a single stab wound to the right kidney--which is identical to the manner in which Ordonez and Forester were killed. Mulder concludes that Marty gained her unique sense when her then-pregnant mother died at the murderer's hands.

Marty is released from custody after police match fingerprints on the briefcase taken from the locker to Gotts... who turns out to be Marty's own father. Marty tells police that Gotts, who was recently paroled from prison, can be located at the Blarney Stone tavern. Mulder and Scully stake out the bar, waiting for Gotts' appearance. Meanwhile, Pennock provides Marty with protection from harm by guarding her at her apartment. Marty experiences another vision, this time seeing Gotts reading names on mailboxes in the lobby. Using a coffee pot, Marty knocks Pennock unconscious. She pulls his gun from his holster and takes position, waiting for Gotts. Meanwhile, Mulder realizes that the blind Marty has been experiencing visions of the inside of Gotts's prison cell for almost thirty years. He tells Scully that Marty misdirected them on purpose... to keep Gotts from going back to prison. They race to Marty's apartment, where they find Gotts dead on the floor. Later, Marty asks for no special treatment in her defense and is sent to prison--where she is finally free of Gotts.

Father McCue, the family priest who comforted Scully during her bout with cancer, baptizes Dara Kernof, a sixteen-year-old, severely mentally-retarded girl confined to a wheelchair. Later that night, as a thunderstorm rages, Dara somehow gains strength in her legs and leaves her house. Dara's father, Lance, realizes something is amiss and makes his way outside. There he sees Dara in the middle of the street, her arms raised upward, kneeling before a Dark Figure. Suddenly, lightning flashes, supernaturally bright. When Lance reaches his daughter, he realizes she is dead--her eyes gone, as if having been burned out of their sockets. The Dark Figure, however, is nowhere in sight.

Father McCue contacts Scully and asks for her help in solving the mystery of the girl's death. Later, Scully visits the Kerofs, and learns that Dara was adopted six years earlier. The girl suffered from severe spinal deformities which confined her to a wheelchair her entire life. There is no explanation as to how Dara walked out of the house, though Lance is convinced he saw the Devil standing over her in the street.

Scully and a pathologist, Vicki Belon, examine Dara's body. Belon notes her misshapen hands and feet, which contain six digits (the extra fingers having been removed via surgery). Belon reluctantly proposes that the girl was struck down by God, as if she was a mistake.

Meanwhile, a man named Father Gregory visits a psychiatric hospital hoping to visit a girl named Paula Koklos, Dara's twin sister. But his progress is hindered by Aaron Starkey, a department of social services worker, who notes that the priest's adoption petition lacks his approval. Upset, the priest leaves the hospital. That night, a man enters Paula's room. An intense halo of light surrounds the figure and wings form its back. The next day, Scully examines Paula's body, her eyes burned out, kneeling much like Dara. Mulder joins his partner and reveals he has located Dara's birth records, which show she was one of quadruplets. Shortly thereafter, Starkey reveals that Paula was about to be adopted by Gregory.

The agents pay Gregory a visit at his church. He insists he was trying to protect Paula from harm, and makes reference to an ongoing struggle between good and evil for all souls. Later, while examining Paula's body, Scully experiences a vision of Emily.

Mulder performs further research on the adoption records. He uncovers information on a third sister, who walked into a teen crisis center a week earlier and is apparently homeless. With Starkey's help, he canvases abandoned buildings in a desolate part of town. But the Dark Figure, this time sporting a hideous lion's face, finds the girl first. Mulder draws his weapon and orders a darkened figure to step into the light. It is revealed to be Father Gregory. Gregory laments that they are too late, as he found the third sister dead.

Mulder concludes Gregory is responsible for the murders. But Gregory insists he tried to protect the girls' souls from the Devil. He warns that the fourth sister must be located before it is too late. The agents step out of the police interrogation room where Gregory is being held when new information about the fourth sister, Roberta Dyer, comes to light. Scully urges Mulder to find the girl. Meanwhile, Starkey enters the interrogation room where Gregory is being held. He demands to know the location of the fourth girl. When Gregory does not answer, he is burned alive by the demon.

Mulder makes his way to the home of George Dyer, the fourth sister's adoptive father. Dyer eventually reveals that Father Gregory took Roberta away. Shortly thereafter, Scully is approached by the Dark Figure, whose head rotates, revealing the faces of a lion, a fierce bird, and a satyr. Stunned, Scully seeks out Father McCue for answers. He explains that the vision she experienced is a Seraphim, an angel who descended from the heavens and fathered four children with a mortal woman. The Lord sent Seraphim to earth to return the girls, who have the souls of angels, back to heaven to keep the Devil from claiming them as his own.

Later, Starkey tells Scully that the fourth girl is at Father Gregory's church. Once inside the church, Scully sees Starkey's shadow, which is in the form of a demon. Scully rescues the girl from a crawlspace and attempts to make her way out a back exit. A blinding white light suddenly erupts, the source of which is the mysterious Dark Figure. The fourth girl changes into the form of Emily--and begs Scully to let go. Scully reluctantly releases the girl's hand, and she disappears into the light. When the light fades, only the girl's body remains, her eyes burnt away. Later, Scully tells Mulder they should have been protecting the girls from Starkey, not Father Gregory. She also believes that no one killed the girls... but they are now in a place where they were meant to be. She concludes the incident was about letting go... of Emily.

@{fg shine}The Pine Bluff Variant [#114]@{fg text}

Skinner, Scully, Mulder and a dozen FBI agents participate in an undercover operation in a Washington, D.C. park. Its purpose: to catch Jacob Haley, a militia group member wanted on domestic terrorism charges. As Skinner and Scully monitor events from a surveillance van, Mulder and several other undercover agents slowly close in on their suspect, who meets with a Goateed Man sitting on a park bench. Haley hands the Goatee Man an envelope, then suddenly runs off. Mulder gives chase, unaware that the skin on Goatee Man's face and hands is slowly being eaten away. Scully jumps from the van, intending to warn her partner. But when she reaches Mulder, she is astounded to discover that the suspect eluded capture.

Scully voices her concerns to her partner, looking for some explanation as to why he allowed Haley to escape. But Mulder sidesteps the issue. Shortly thereafter, the agents attend a meeting of a counter-terrorism council, which is headed by Skinner and U.S. Attorney Leamus. During the meeting, Scully states that the Goatee Man was killed by some form of bioweapon. Skinner then shows those in attendance a photo of August Bremer, the militia group's mastermind. He notes that Bremer and Haley are reportedly vying for control.

Her curiosity piqued, Scully begins surveilling her partner's movements from afar. Mulder rents a room at a motel, where he has a heated telephone conversation with Haley, one that implies the pair are working together. Shortly thereafter, a BMW rolls into the motel parking lot, and Mulder climbs in. Scully tails the car, but her progress is halted when two sedans force her to stop. Four large men then approach her vehicle. Scully is escorted to a government building where, to her surprise, she is met by Skinner and Leamus. They explain that Mulder is participating in a deep cover assignment, the existence of which is known only to Skinner and Leamus. Someone in the militia group reached out to Mulder after he voiced his opinions about governmental conspiracies during a UFO conference.

The BMW transports Mulder to a remote farmhouse. There, Mulder is questioned by Haley, who accuses him of spying on the group. When Mulder fails to give acceptable answers, a Skin-Head Man pushes back on his finger, causing Mulder to scream in pain. The torture session continues until Mulder suggests a mole exists within the group. Suddenly, the Skin-Head man pulls back on the finger, snapping it like a piece of celery. When Mulder passes out, Haley turns to him and says, "I believe you." Meanwhile, Bremer tests the bioweapon on patrons at a small movie theater, killing fourteen people. But the question remains as to how the pathogen was spread to the victims.

When Mulder returns to his apartment, he is surprised by Scully. She tends to his broken finger and discusses the undercover operation. Unbeknownst to them, Bremer is secretly recording their conversation. Later, Mulder reports back to Skinner and Leamus. It is determined that the militia group intends to rob a bank. Mulder also relays word that Haley demanded copies of surveillance files of militia group members (hoping to flush out the mole). Leamus reveals he anticipated such a request, and already has redacted microfilm documents prepared. Mulder returns to the motel and gives Haley the microfilm. He is then transported back to the farmhouse, where the militia group is readying its assault on the bank.

Scully determines that the toxin was not developed by the Russians as previously believed. In private, she tells Skinner that the United States is operating a secret bioweapons program--and that someone in the government may have sent Mulder on a suicide mission. Later, it suddenly dawns on Scully that the source of pathogen's distribution is money.

Wearing monster masks, Mulder and the militia members storm a bank. Bremer accesses the vault and sprays the money with the pathogen. The group stages a successful getaway, and later Mulder realizes that the entire purpose of the break-in was to contaminate the money. Bremer pulls a gun on Mulder, announcing that his undercover work has been exposed. But Haley intercedes, noting that Bremer's alias was discovered on the microfilm, exposing him as the mole. Bremer responds by playing back the secret tape recording he made of Mulder and Scully's conversation. Bremer hands Haley a leather car key holder, allowing him to leave the group unharmed. But Bremer and the Skin-Head Man march Mulder away, intending to execute him. Suddenly, Bremer kills the Skin-Head Man. Bremer tells Mulder to run before they are both exposed. Mulder makes his way back to the bank, which has already been sealed off by Scully and Skinner. Scully explains that she recognized Mulder on a bank surveillance tape by the bandage on his finger. As the money is hauled out of the bank, Leamus tells the agents that the bills have tested clean. Scully accuses Leamus of having orchestrated the entire plan. Later, Haley slumps over in his car, his face eaten away by the biotoxin, which was transmitted by the key holder given him by Bremer.

@{fg shine}Folie a Deux [#115]@{fg text}

Gary Lambert works as a vinyl siding telemarketer in Oak Brook, Illinois. On the surface, Gary would seem to be a mild-mannered Everyman. But unbeknownst to his co-workers, Gary is convinced that his boss is an evil monster who preys on his own staff, turning them into the undead. One morning, Skinner summons Mulder and Scully to his office. He explains that the company Gary works for, VinylRight, received an anonymous, audio-taped manifesto, on which a man threatens to commit a violent act. As a result, the company wishes to have the threat investigated. Mulder is puzzled as to why Skinner is sending he and Scully to investigate. Skinner then explains that the maker of the tape spoke of a monster threatening employees. Somewhat irked, Mulder tells Scully he will handle the case alone, labeling himself "Monster Boy."

When Mulder arrives at the company, he is greeted by office manager Greg Pincus, who plays him the taped message. Mulder's interest is piqued by a reference to "hiding in the light." He telephones Scully and asks her to investigate previous X-Files cases for such a phrase. Meanwhile, Gary grows concerned when a fellow employee, Nancy Aaronson, is summoned to Greg's office. When Nancy returns to her cubicle, Gary notices that, from his point of view, she appears to be dead.

Scully telephones Mulder when she finishes researching the files. It turns out that the phrase "hiding in the light" was also used by a deacon at a Lakeland, Florida church. The deacon was convinced that one of his parishioners was an evil presence. One Sunday, he entered the church for mass and opened fire on his flock. When Mulder returns to VinylRight, he finds a sea of deserted cubicles. Nancy's head peeks out from behind a wall and warns Mulder to take cover. Before he has time to react, Gary approaches--armed with an AK-47. Mulder slowly raises his hands into the air.

Scully flies to Illinois and joins FBI and SWAT team members who have surrounded the building. Inside, Gary uses his co-workers to form a human barricade. A SWAT team commander overrules Scully and dials Mulder's cell phone. Gary opens Mulder's jacket... and notices his gun within. Gary kicks Mulder in the head, knocking him to the ground. A hostage then charges Gary, but he swivels and opens fire, killing the man. Gary then speaks with an FBI agent, and demands that a television crew be sent into the building so he can broadcast his fears to the public. Using a closed-circuit system, the FBI fools Gary into thinking his image is being broadcast throughout the city. Addressing the camera, Gary raises his gun and points it at Greg. He instructs everyone to look at Greg... to look at "it." Mulder glances over his shoulder... and sees a monster where Pincus was standing. Suddenly, an Armored Personnel Carrier bursts through a wall. A SWAT team member opens fire, striking Gary.

Mulder cannot dismiss what he saw inside the office complex. After performing additional research, Mulder determines that five previous X-Files cases involve monster that went unnoticed by all accept the claimant. Scully reacts with incredulity when Mulder suggests that Gary was not insane, but actually saw the creature he described. Scully attributes Mulder's behavior to "folie a deux," a madness shared by people under tense conditions.

Meanwhile, Mulder follows Greg Pincus to the home of Gretchen Starns, one of his employees. As Mulder stands outside of the house, and gazes through a window, he sees the monster advance behind Gretchen, its insect-like mouth aiming for the back of her neck. The woman suddenly screams, prompting Mulder to shatter the window glass. The monster defies gravity by crawling over the house.

Gretchen lodges a complaint with the FBI, accusing Mulder of breaking into her home. During a meeting with Skinner, Mulder sees Pincus, in the form of the monster, advancing. Mulder draws his gun, but Skinner, believing Mulder has lost his mind, gains the upper hand. Mulder is then admitted to a mental institution. Later, at Mulder's prompting, Scully examines the back of the dead hostage's neck. There she discovers tiny puncture marks. At the hospital, a restrained Mulder listens in horror as the monster approaches the window to his room. Mulder calls for the nurse... only to realize that she is one of the monster's minions. Scully visits the hospital... and experiences a vision of the nurse as one of the living dead. She races to Mulder's room, where she discovers the creature crawling on the ceiling. She opens fire, but the creature escapes. Later, Scully meets with Skinner. She voices her belief that Mulder is of sound mind. She notes that an unidentified toxin was found in the dead hostage, and notes that Pincus has disappeared, along with the nurse and several VinylRight employees. After recovering from his ordeal, Mulder returns to work. Scully informs him she told Skinner the truth: the incident can only be explained as a "folie a deux."

@{fg shine}The End [#116]@{fg text}

Inside a sports arena, two chess masters, a Russian man and an odd-looking 12-year-old boy named Gibson Praise, engage in a battle of the minds as an audience sits in reverential silence. High above the crowd, on a catwalk overhanging the arena, a sniper aims his rifle towards the back of the child's head. As the gunman slowly squeezes the trigger, the little boy announces "checkmate," and slides back in his chair. A gunshot rings out... and the Russian falls to the floor, dead. Meanwhile, two armed, masked figures close in on the cabin where the Cigarette-Smoking Man has holed up. A sensor alerts the Cigarette-Smoking Man to their presence, and he manages to kill one of them before making his escape into the woods. The second masked gunman gets the drop on his prey... and reveals himself as Alex Krycek.

Skinner briefs Mulder on the death of the Russian chess player. It turns out that the sniper is a former member of the National Security Agency. The case was assigned to Agent Spender, who specified that Mulder be excluded from the investigation. Despite this, Mulder and Skinner crash Spender's briefing. While viewing videotape of the assassination, Mulder reaches the conclusion that the shooter's target was Gibson--not the Russian--as the boy reacted in an almost precognitive fashion moments before the shot rang out. Spender disagrees with the theory. Agent Diana Fowley, an attractive woman in her thirties, opines that Mulder is correct. Spender rewinds the tape... and forms the same conclusion.

The Cigarette-Smoking Man meets with the Syndicate Elders. Labeling Gibson a threat, they ask for the Cigarette-Smoking Man's help in orchestrating his elimination.

Mulder, Scully and Diana Fowley visit Gibson inside a psychiatric hospital. The boy declines Mulder's invitation to match wits against a cheap chess computer... giving credence to Mulder's suspicion that the boy is not a chess master, but a mind reader. Tests on the child's brain reveal that Gibson is, indeed, clairvoyant. Later, Mulder visits the shooter in his cell. He offers him immunity from prosecution in exchange for his cooperation.

Scully cannot help but notice chemistry between Mulder and Fowley. She pays the Lone Gunman an unexpected visit. She gives them data from the tests performed on Gibson, and asks that it be analyzed. Scully also asks for information on Diana Fowley. The three men confirm that she and Mulder were an item back when Mulder graduated from the Academy and first discovered the existence of the X-Files. Scully returns to the psychiatric hospital intending to show Mulder the data she has accumulated. But when she approaches the observation room, she notices Mulder and Diana inside... and Diana holding Mulder's hand. Scully, a confusion of emotions, both personal and professional, leaves the hospital. When Mulder enters the hospital's parking garage to retrieve his car, he notices Spender talking to the Cigarette-Smoking Man. Mulder pushes Spender hard in the chest, demanding to know his business. Spender explains that he does not know the identity of the mysterious man. He then reveals that the shooter wishes to speak with Mulder.

Scully meets with Skinner and Mulder to reveal the results of the psychiatric tests on Gibson. It turns out that an area of the child's brain, dubbed the "God Module" by neurophysicists, exhibits extraordinary activity. Mulder believes the child's life is in danger because of his gift, as it might be the key to solving the unexplained phenomena contained within the X-Files. He also suspects that the assassin holds the key to the vast conspiracy working against him. Skinner points out that the very existence of the X-Files would be put at risk if he asks the Attorney General to grant immunity to the assassin. Later, Mulder approaches the shooter and asks him for information he can corroborate. He reveals that Gibson is a missing link--genetic proof of man's relationship to an alien race .

The Cigarette-Smoking Man puts his plan in motion. The assassin is murdered inside his cell. Shortly thereafter, a bullet strikes Fowley as she stands watch over Gibson. The Cigarette-Smoking Man delivers the child to the Well-Manicured Man and Krycek.

When Mulder sees Spender at the Bureau, he pushes him into a wall. He angrily accuses him of orchestrating Gibson's disappearance in conjunction with the Cigarette Smoking Man. Other agents restrain Mulder, dragging him away. Spender responds by stating that Mulder's days are numbered. Later, Scully informs her partner there is talk of shutting down the X-Files. That night, the Cigarette-Smoking Man sneaks into Mulder's office and steals a file on Samantha Mulder. He then addresses Spender face-to-face. He informs him that he is his father. Suddenly, a fire alarm sounds and agents make their way into the hallway. The Cigarette-Smoking Man disappears into the crowd. Later, Mulder inspects the damage to his office, where the cabinet containing the X-Files is a melted skeleton. Scully places her arms around her partner, offering support.

@{fg shine}The Beginning [#117]@{fg text}

On the sly, A.D. Skinner gives Mulder a lead on a strange case in Arizona that might give him the hard evidence he needs. At the crime scene, Mulder theorizes that the victim was infected by an alien virus and that this virus ultimately produced an alien entity. The entity then ripped away the victim's chest from the inside as it birthed itself.

Meantime, the Syndicate is irate that this "situation" has surfaced and is getting so much attention. Cigarette-Smoking Man assures them that he is taking care of the problem. He brings Gibson Praise, the young chess prodigy, to the crime scene in hopes that Praise can divine where the creature has escaped to.

The agents are drawn to a nearby power plant where another murder has occurred. They are met by agents Spender and Fowley who deny Mulder access to the new crime scene. When Mulder and Scully return to their car, they find Praise hiding in the back seat.

Mulder wants to use Praise to find the alien creature, but Scully talks him out of it, explaining that Praise is the scientific evidence Mulder's been looking for. Praise can corroborate everything Mulder's been saying. Scully tells Mulder that Praise needs medical attention and just as they're about to drive him to the hospital, Agent Fowley arrives. Scully continues on to the hospital with Praise, while Mulder and Fowley go to the plant to find the creature.

At the plant, Mulder and Fowley discover evidence that the alien is there. He calls Scully at the hospital to tell her this; in turn, she reveals that Praise has traces of the alien virus in his body -- somehow, Praise is part extraterrestrial. While Scully's attention is diverted, Black-Haired Man kidnaps Praise and takes him to the power plant to find and destroy the alien. Mulder catches up with Praise and Black-Haired Man, but it is too late. They have locked themselves inside the core reactor room. Mulder watches helplessly as the alien kills Black-Haired Man. The alien turns on Praise just as the plant's alarms sound and FBI agents swarm the area. Fowley, now seeming to be on Spender's side, approaches Mulder and tells him to back off.

Back at the review board, the panel tells Mulder and Scully to cease all association with the X-Files. They are put on probation and told to report to a new boss, Assistant Director Kersh.

Via a live news report, a high-speed car chase comes to an end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, the female passenger is pulled from the vehicle and placed into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump, is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in the police car begins violently banging her head against the car window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window.

The agents get wind of this bizarre car chase as they're doing scut work in Idaho. Mulder coerces Scully into taking a detour by Elko, Nevada on a hunch that this may be an X-File. Once there, however, Mulder manages to get himself kidnapped by Crump, who has escaped from the police.

Mulder realizes that Crump is in a considerable amount of pain and that the only way to ease the pain is to drive west. Scully investigates the Crumps home and discovers that an antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. She deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion seems to be the only thing to help the ease the pain of the increasing pressure.

Mulder explains to Crump that Scully will meet them at the end of the highway. There she will insert a needle into Crump's inner ear, hopefully relieving the pressure. But when Mulder arrives, it is too late. Crump has already died.

@{fg shine}Triangle [#119]@{fg text}

Thrown out of his dingy by a ferocious storm in the Sargasso Sea, Mulder is fished out the ocean by hostile sailors. When he regains his wits, he realizes he's boarded the "Queen Anne", an English luxury liner that disappeared in the 1930s during World War II.

Brought before the ship's captain Yip Harburgh, Mulder tries to explain that the war is over and that the boat has been caught in some kind of time warp called the Devil's Triangle for the past 50 years. But he captain and crew have very different feelings, as the reality of the moment tells us that the liner has been captured by Nazi soldiers. The Nazis believe that the boat is carrying "Thor's Hammer", which they assume to be an atom bomb. When Mulder accidentally reveals that "Thor's Hammer" is the scientist who can make an atom bomb, the Nazis steer a path for Germany, hoping to use the atom bomb technology to win the war.

The atom bomb scientist on board is traveling with a woman who looks identical to Scully. Mulder enlists the aid of the Scully look-alike, telling her she must turn the ship around and save the future. If she doesn't, the Germans will win the war, and ultimately, Mulder and Scully will not exist. The Scully look-alike is confused, but Mulder is in a hurry, he's got to get back to his own history. Realizing he may never get another chance, he gives the Scully look-alike a deep kiss, for which she repays him with a "special" kiss of her own - a right hook to his chin. Mulder jumps overboard.

Meantime, the Lone Gunmen approach Scully at FBI headquarters and inform her of Mulder's disappearance. She enlists the help of Skinner to get information from the Navy's satellite tracking system to find the missing ship.

Racing to the spot where Mulder disappeared, the Gunmen and Scully find the ship and rescue Mulder. At the hospital, the Lone Gunmen, Scully and Skinner visit Mulder. He tries to explain all that happened, but they downplay it as a dream. They all wish him a speedy recovery and leave. It is then that Mulder feels a bruise on his face given to him by one of the Nazis. And he realizes it wasn't a dream after all.

@{fg shine}Dreamland, Part 1 [#120]@{fg text}

Mulder drags Scully deep in the Nevada desert to meet a "source" who supposedly works at Area 51 and is going to give Mulder proof positive of the government's experimentation with alien technology. Unfortunately, before they can rendez-vous with the informant, they are stopped by other Area 51 officials who tell them they must turn around. As Scully tries to haul Mulder back into the car, a UFO flies overhead. It emits a massive heat ripple which switches the personalities of Mulder and Morris Fletcher, one of the Area 51 officials. Unbeknownst to anyone other than Mulder and Morris, Morris (who now inhabits Mulder's body) climbs back into the car with Scully, leaving Mulder (who is now in Morris' body) with the Area 51 goons.

Entrenched behind the walls of the mecca of UFO lore, Mulder tries to untangle the mess he's found himself in. Morris, on the other hand, is just happy to be given this new life as a single FBI agent; he doesn't lift one finger to try to reverse the situation.

Mulder tries to prove to Scully that he is not Morris, though Scully is skeptical at best. He tells her he will give her scientific proof via a flight data recorder which was recovered from another plane that crashed during test flights at Area 51. Unfortunately, Morris (aka Mulder) gets wind of Mulder's plan and informs A.D. Kersh. Kersh then orders Scully to set a trap for Mulder. The Area 51 police arrive and capture Mulder. And as Scully watches the MPs drag off this man who looks like Morris Fletcher, but claims to be Mulder, she wonders if there may be any truth to the odd turn of events.

Still trapped inside Man-In-Black Morris' body, Mulder manages to evade the brig when his fellow MIB cohorts discover that the flight data recorder Mulder tried to give Scully was a fake. They come to the conclusion that Mulder was trying to run a scam on the FBI. Mulder plays along and the MIBs are relieved, but still want the original flight data recorder back. Mulder waffles, but tells them he has it and that he'll return it.

Meanwhile, Scully is put on suspension and Morris (in Mulder's body) tries to ease her pain by inviting her to his house for a home-cooked meal. Suspicious at first, she agrees. But when she gets there, she finds an immaculate apartment and an actual bedroom she never knew Mulder had. Things are just a bit too weird. She confronts Morris about the switch and he comes clean, further explaining that he has no idea how to switch back.

A reluctant Morris accompanies Scully as she reveals to Mulder that there may not be a way to reverse this process. But somehow, one of the MIBs discover that the time warp is snapping back, reversing time in the process. He positions Mulder and Morris in the right time at the right place and their personalities are returned to the rightful bodies. Their memories of the past few days are rewound as well and no one remembers a thing. This perplexes Mulder when returns home to find a spotless apartment.

@{fg shine}How The Ghosts Stole Christmas [#122]@{fg text}

It's late Christmas Eve. Telling tales of star-crossed lovers who forged a pact to be together for eternity, Mulder lures Scully into the darkened mansion that the ghost couple purportedly haunts. Once inside, the front door locks behind the duo and traps them inside. Mulder believes it is the work of the ghosts who inhabit the house. Scully, ever the skeptic, instructs Mulder on the psychology of peoples' need to believe in the afterlife as a means to satisfy their fear of mortality. But when a previously locked door springs open and a light shines from inside the room beyond, Mulder chalks it up to ghosts. Scully, admitting that she is afraid but that it's an irrational fear, still sticks with the belief that people might be actually living in the house.

Passing through the door, the partners find themselves in a library. And in a series of odd twists and turns, they become separated -each trapped in some parallel universe version of the library. It is here that Mulder meets Maurice The Ghost (Ed Asner), who convinces Mulder to shoot Scully. In her own parallel library, Scully meets Lyda The Ghost (Lily Tomlin), who convinces Scully to shoot Mulder. When the two agents meet back up, they follow through on the ghosts' mischievous plan and fire their weapons on each other. As they lay gasping on the staircase landing, they realize it was only some kind of mind trick played on them by the ghosts.

Safely ensconced back in their homes, the duo agree that the events of the evening never happened.

Wayne and Laura Weinsider are just like any other couple - they want to start a family. But when the ultrasound shows possible deformities in the baby that Laura is carrying, it is Wayne who becomes visibly upset. That night, Laura has a nightmare that a demon has come to steal her baby. When she wakes, she realizes the nightmare has come true and that her unborn baby has been taken from her.

The town's sheriff, who happens to be Laura's brother, brings the case to Agent Spender who round-files it to the shredder. But Mulder manages to salvage the report and begins his own investigation. His primary suspect is Wayne but Scully thinks that Laura self-aborted and has her arrested. Meantime, Mulder follows Wayne and ultimately uncovers that Wayne has been living a dual life. His second wife, Betsy, lives on the other side of town and Mulder fears for her safety. As Mulder and Scully race to save Betsy, a car skids to a stop in the middle of the road. It's Betsy, who exits the car bleeding, exclaiming that Wayne took her baby.

Moving on to Betsy's house, Mulder and Scully find Wayne furiously digging in the backyard. The agents think Wayne is burying Betsy's unborn baby, but before Wayne can tell them otherwise, the sheriff arrives and shoots Wayne down. What Wayne would have told the agents is that he was actually digging up unborn normal babies - the ones Betsy had buried there. Being a demon himself, a normal baby was all Wayne ever wanted. But it seems Betsy, being even more evil than he, had always wanted just the opposite - a demon baby. And as Betsy drives into the sunset with her newborn baby, we see that's exactly what she got.

@{fg shine}The Rain King [#124]@{fg text}

Kroner, Kansas has been experiencing a three-month drought. It's Valentine's Day and Sheila Fontaine waits for her boyfriend, Darryl Mootz. When he arrives home, he's angry that Sheila has prematurely spread word of their engagement and storms out of the house, leaving Sheila alone with her tears and a box of chocolates. Shortly thereafter, Darryl is caught in a freak hailstorm which causes him to wreck his car.

It's six months later and nine months into the drought. Mulder and Scully are called to Kroner by the town's mayor who believes that Darryl is causing the drought so he can charge people for the rain. When the agents check with Holman Hardt, the local meteorologist, Holman substantiates part of the mayor's claim - Holman believes that Darryl can make it rain. While Mulder and Scully check out Darryl's side-show, Sheila tells Holman she's nervous that the FBI are poking around. Shortly thereafter, Mulder's life is threatened when a cow is picked up by a mini-twister and hurled through the roof of the motel where he's staying.

Out of guilt, Sheila confesses that she is the one who has been causing all of the terrible weather-related catastrophes that have been occurring in Kroner for the past twenty years. Mulder, however, has another theory. He believes that Holman is the culprit and that it is the feelings he can't express that have been effecting the weather. To wit, Holman has been pining away for Sheila since they were in high school together. But Sheila has divulged to Holman that she's got a crush on Mulder. Holman, in turn, causes it to rain in flash-flood proportions.

To stop the deluge, Mulder gives Holman "dating" advice, telling him that he must tell Sheila how he feels about her. After much prodding, Holman opens his heart to her. One year later finds Holman and Sheila married with a child. And the weather, as you can imagine, is perfect.

A man is rushed into the emergency room near death. One of the doctors tells the nurse to call Agent Scully because the sick man works for the FBI. We assume that it is Agent Mulder; only to find, however, that it is actually Assistant Director Skinner.

Flashback twenty-four hours. Agent Mulder finds A.D. Skinner in his office, not feeling well. He calls in Scully who posits that Skinner may have been poisoned. When asked to recall if anything out of the ordinary happened in his day, Skinner remembers that a renowned physicist named Kenneth Orgel stopped him in the hallway earlier in the day. Mulder and Skinner pay a visit to Orgel, only to find him in the process of being kidnapped. The kidnappers get away with Orgel; Mulder captures one of the fleeing bad guys, but must release him when he discovers that the man is a Tunisian with diplomatic immunity.

Scully, in the meantime, examines a vial of Skinner's blood. Upon close levels of magnification, she finds miniscule foreign bodies that seem to multiply uniformly and rapidly. These specks are forming dams in Skinner's veins, cutting off his blood flow and building a heart attack.

Mulder rifes through Orgel's house and finds a connection to Senator Matheson. Paying the Senator a visit, he finds out about Senate Resolution 819 - a health bill which will supply medical technology for third world countries. Ripping apart Skinner's office, Mulder finds that Skinner was doing a security check on the resolution and that, somehow, his connection to the resolution is what got him poisoned. He confronts Senator Matheson again and finds out that nanotechnology - microscopic atom-sized machines that had been previously thought of as only theoretical -- have been injected into Skinner and someone is programming them to kill him.

Meanwhile, Skinner lies on a hospital bed, his pulse flatlines. The orderly calls time of death. Moments later, Skinner gasps and comes back to life. Weeks later, Scully reports that whatever infected Skinner has gone into remission. Mulder asks for permission to continue the investigation but Skinner closes the case.

At day's end, Skinner heads for his car. In the backseat, he finds the man who had been driving the nanotechnology atoms - Krycek. Krycek glares at Skinner - he's got Skinner under his thumb and intends to keep him there.

@{fg shine}Tithonus [#126]@{fg text}

Relegated to doing background checks, Scully and Mulder are bored stiff. Assistant Director Kersh finally calls Scully up and pairs her with New York City field agent, Peyton Ritter, for a special assignment. While scanning old crime scene photos into the computer, Ritter stumbled upon inconsistencies in the times that the photos were taken. He feels that the man who took the pictures, a stringer named Alfred Fellig, is responsible. Ritter theorizes that Fellig kills people, takes their picture, then shows up later when called to do the crime scene photo job for the wire services.

In a dark alley in the Bronx, a mugger tackles and kills his victim. Mid-crime, the mugger looks up to see Fellig on a fire escape, taking pictures. The mugger then turns on Fellig and knifes him in the back. Fellig falls to the concrete, dead, and the mugger takes off. Minutes after he's gone, Fellig pulls the knife out of his back and staggers off into the night.

Fellig is brought in for questioning but denies killing anyone; he was just there for "the shot". And since they have no proof that Fellig committed the crime, they release him. But Ritter begins 24-hour surveillance on Fellig. Scully relieves Ritter late at night, only to realize shortly after Ritter leaves that Fellig is watching her. Exasperated, she confronts Fellig about his involvement in the murders that he photographs. He invites her to come for a ride and he will show Scully how he happens to be johnny-on-the-spot when a murder is committed.

After driving around for hours, Fellig finally stops and points to a hooker. He tells Scully that the hooker will be dead within the hour. Not believing him, Scully confronts the hooker, who backs away from Scully, heads into the street and is run down by an oncoming truck. Scully, in shock at what she may have just caused, looks up in time to see Fellig drive off.

Mulder does some low-tech research on his own and calls Scully to tell her that Fellig has a penchant for changing identities, the farthest one dating back to 1849. This makes Fellig 149 years old. Scully, not wanting Fellig to have another identity crisis, goes to Fellig's apartment where he ushers her into his darkroom. He explains that he was marked for death a long time ago, but somehow Death missed him. Fellig has been taking photos of dying people ever since in hopes of capturing the visage of Death on film so that he can look into Death's face and die as well.

During the conversation, Fellig realizes that Scully is marked for Death and readies to take her picture. Agent Ritter arrives and fires instinctively into the darkened room. The bullet hits Fellig as well as Scully. As Ritter moves into the other room to call for help, Fellig takes Scully's hand and tells her not to look into Death's face. She closes her eyes and Death finally takes Fellig.

Inside a stockyard in Arlington, Virginia, a surgeon escorts Dr. Openshaw inside a train car containing a surgical bay. Openshaw approaches an operating table, on which lies a patient, her face unseen. The surgeon congratulates Openshaw on his work, some 25 years in the making, which is now a success. The surgeon exits the train car, only to be lit afire by a Faceless Man. The rest of the surgical team, waiting in a nearby van, are also incinerated. A Faceless Man enters the surgical bay and thrusts his weapon at Openshaw, burning him. The creature then looks upon the operating table. where an unconscious Cassandra Spender lies.

Skinner escorts Agent Spender to the stockyard. He explains that a group of people were burned alive, and that only his mother, and a critically injured man, survived. Spender sees his mother in a nearby paramedics vehicle and goes to her side. Cassandra asks to speak with Mulder. Moments later, Spender tells Skinner that he objects to the idea of Mulder's involvement in the case. But Spender changes his mind, and reluctantly informs Mulder of his mother's request to speak with him. Mulder tells Spender to find the truth himself.

Meanwhile, the Cigarette Smoking Man approaches Openshaw, who miraculously survived the fire and has been confined to a plastic tent inside a hospital. Openshaw tells him that Cassandra is a success, and must be terminated before the alien colonists find out that a human/alien hybrid exists. Shortly thereafter, the Cigarette Smoking Man kills Openshaw.

The Cigarette Smoking Man telephones Elder #1 to inform him about an emergency meeting of the Syndicate. Elder #1 promises he will make the meeting. He makes his way to the front door. only to find Openshaw standing on the other side. Elder #1 grabs at the impostor's face, exposing a faceless rebel beneath. A struggle ensues, and the Elder is killed.

Scully and Mulder decide to meet with Cassandra without informing Spender of their action. Miraculously, Cassandra pushes back the covers and lets her legs fall to the floor. Scully looks on, incredulous, as the previously wheelchair-bound Cassandra walks without assistance. Cassandra tells the agents that surgeons worked in conjunction with the aliens to cure her. She now believes that the aliens are plotting to take over the universe by infecting all life forms with a black virus. The surgeons were burned by another race of aliens-faceless rebels-who mutilated their faces so they wouldn't be infected. Cassandra now believes that her son's life is in danger, as he is in collusion with men who have worked with the aliens.

In flashback, some 35 years earlier, Openshaw, Bill Mulder, and the Cigarette Smoking Man enter a train car containing a Native American test subject. The Native American's face, arms and body are horribly disfigured. Repulsed, Bill Mulder exits the train car. As the disfigured man is their best effort, both the Cigarette Smoking Man and Openshaw believe they must ally with the aliens if they ever hope to create a human/alien hybrid.

Back in the present day, the Syndicate members, including Krycek and the Cigarette Smoking Man, gather for the meeting. Elder #1 suggests an alliance with the alien rebels, something completely at odds with everything the group has strived for. After the meeting, Krycek informs the Cigarette Smoking Man that Mulder paid Cassandra a secret visit.

Scully and Mulder sneak into Mulder's old office, where they access computer files on Cassandra Spender, her son, and the Cigarette Smoking Man, who is identified by the name "C.G.B. Spender." But the computer has no additional information on the mysterious man. Moments later, Skinner warns the agents that they are about to get caught. Before Mulder and Scully have a chance to escape, they are confronted by Spender. Later, Spender informs his father that Mulder and Scully will be processed out of the FBI. He then asks for the truth about his mother. The Cigarette Smoking Man tells him that Cassandra has been involved in a very important experiment. But he does not elaborate further, as Spender must prove himself capable of the responsibility that comes with such knowledge. Meanwhile, Scully performs some research. She learns that Cassandra Spender was first abducted on the night of November 27th, 1973. the same night Mulder's sister was abducted.

The Cigarette Smoking Man tells Spender about Elder #1's death. He instructs Spender to kill the imposter using a gimlet weapon. Krycek drives Spender to Elder #1's home. Unfortunately, Spender cannot muster the nerve to carry out his assignment. The Elder #1 imposter sees the gimlet in Spender's hand and attacks him. Krycek comes to Spender's rescue, driving the gimlet into the imposter's neck. Afterward, a Iago-like Krycek informs Spender that his father directed the experiments forced on Cassandra. Spender realizes he is being asked to protect his mother so the experiments can continue.

Back at the hospital, Cassandra enters the bathroom to smoke a cigarette. As she looks in the mirror, her face suddenly loses its shape. Cassandra screams. The female FBI agent assigned to protect her races to her aid. She assures Cassandra that she will be all right, as she is "the one." Cassandra stares at her, not comprehending. The female FBI agent reaches up to her own face and pulls back her flesh. revealing a male Faceless Alien beneath. Cassandra recoils in fear. Clad in the FBI agent's clothing, she flees to Mulder's apartment. With time running out, she begs the agents to kill her, because if she lives, there will be no stopping what is about to happen.

Mulder is about to pull the trigger and end Cassandra Spender's life, when the door to his apartment is forced open and CDC agents storm in, taking Mulder, Scully and Cassandra into custody.

In a quarantined area at Ft. Marlene military base, Mulder and Scully are addressed by Diana Fowley. She explains that Cassandra Spender had contracted a highly contagious virus and needed to be put in isolation pending full medical evaluation. Scully scoffs at this notion, calling it unjustified and highly suspicious. Scully believes that Cassandra was taken so that the tests could continue. But Mulder tells Scully that the tests won't continue because they have been completed; Cassandra is, in fact, the first successful human/alien hybrid. Cassandra knew that; she was begging Mulder to end her life so that the aliens would not start colonization.

In a hallway at Ft. Marlene, Mulder finds Marita Covarrubias. She is a shell of her former self, all her beauty gone. She tells Mulder that they have been performing tests on her - tests to find a vaccine against the Black Oil. She explains to Mulder that the hybrid program was in cooperation with the aliens, but the conspirators never intended to succeed. They were only buying time until a vaccine was created to fight the Black Oil. But now that Cassandra Spendor is a successful human/alien hybrid, colonization will begin.

Scully calls Mulder to the Lone Gunmen's lair where she tells him of her suspicions about Diana Fowley. Scully feels that Diana is somehow working with the Syndicate but Mulder refuses to believe her. Scully storms out and Mulder pays a visit to Diana's apartment. He begins searching her room for any incriminating evidence when he hears another person enter the apartment - the Cigarette Smoking Man. Mulder holds him at gunpoint as C.S.M. substantiates the entire Syndicate operation. He even explains that Mulder's father gave over Mulder's sister Samantha to the aliens as a guarantee of their honor. In return, the aliens gave the Syndicate the alien fetus that would allow the human/alien hybrid work to begin. C.S.M. truly believes that what he did saved millions of lives and ultimately would bring Samantha and other family members back home. It was Mulder's father who thought of the idea to use the alien fetus DNA to make a secret vaccine against the Black Oil.

Jeffrey Spender pays a visit to his father in the Syndicate offices, only to find Krycek in the now abandoned space. Krycek tells Spender that everyone has left for El Rico Air Force Base to receive the hybrid genes and that Spender's father, C.S.M., has gone to get Cassandra to turn her over to the aliens.

Arthur Dales, father of the X-Files, lures Mulder and Scully to Florida's Gulf Coast in the middle of a hurricane with tales of a sea monster on the loose. Scully is not so easily convinced and after checking out a house where the monster supposedly killed a family, she begs Mulder to take the last flight out before the hurricane descends full-force. But the hurricane strikes, closing the airport and all roads out of town.

Forced to take shelter in a nearby apartment building, they find a sheriff's deputy who has been attacked by what Scully terms a water-borne parasite. Mulder, surmising that whatever attacked the deputy might be in the plumbing, decides to check out the rest of the building for inhabitants. He finds a looter, a couple - Walter and his very pregnant girlfriend, Angela, and a militant neighbor, George Vincent.

Huddled in a darkened apartment together, the motley crew watch as the deputy hovers nears death. They pack him in ice in the tub, hoping to abate his rising temperature. But when the group's not looking, the looter steals the deputy's ring and inadvertently knocks a box of Epsom salts into the bath water. Minutes later, pregnant Angela uses the bathroom, only to emerge screaming that she had seen the creature with giant arms like an octopus. When Mulder enters the bathroom, he finds the deputy's body gone, melted into water in the tub. Mulder theorizes that the monster doesn't live in water, but that it is water, taking shape only when it attacks.

To avoid any further attacks, Mulder decides it's time to move everyone to another building. He goes out to the carport only to find the looter has taken the deputy's prowler and escaped, leaving the group stranded. On his way back into the apartment, he is attacked by a coiled tentacle that extends from the ceiling and wraps its arm around Mulder's neck.

Managing to free himself from the monster, Mulder tries to get back into the apartment, but Vincent has locked him out. As he struggles for his life in the hallway, Angela goes into labor and Scully must help deliver the baby. As the new bundle arrives, Scully deduces that fresh water kills the organism and has Walter shoot the sprinkler heads. Simultaneously, Mulder has the same realization when he sees a cat sitting out in the rain rather than finding shelter in the apartment building.

The storm passes and Mulder and Scully wrap up their visit with Dales, who takes great delight in ribbing Mulder that Scully saved his life.

It's Monday morning, and already Mulder's having a bad day. His waterbed sprouts a leak, causing his alarm clock to short out - now he's late for a meeting. His cell phone is busted as well, his neighbors downstairs are complaining about water damage. And to make matters worse, the check he writes to cover the damage is going to bounce unless he deposits his paycheck immediately.

Mulder rushes to his office to pick up his check, telling Scully that he'll be at the meeting as soon as he makes his deposit. Yet, as luck would have it, the very moment Mulder arrives at the bank, a disillusioned janitor named Bernard has decided that he's going to change his own luck - by robbing the bank. Bernard whips out a gun and forces everyone - including Mulder - to drop to the floor. He's edgy, just this side of snapping, and Mulder thinks better of trying to stop him.

Meanwhile, Scully waits with increasing impatience at their meeting - she finally gets up to leave, going to the bank herself. Mulder sees her approaching from across the street and tries to get Bernard to lock the doors - too late. Scully walks in, sees the situation, pulls out her weapon. In the ensuing chaos, and to Scully's horror, Mulder is shot squarely in the chest. As Mulder slowly bleeds to death in her arms, Scully attempts to talk Bernard down. But the burglar alarm has been tripped, Skinner has been alerted, and a SWAT team is just outside. Bernard sees all of this and realizes there is no going back - he opens his jacket, revealing dozens of sticks of dynamite. He flips the trigger - the bank explodes. There's no way anyone could have survived.

Then we're back where we started - Monday morning, leaky waterbed, the same bad day - but it still ends with the exploding bank. The day repeats itself over and over with small variations - some days, Scully deposits Mulder's check, some days Mulder uses the ATM. But each time, no one quite remembers that they've done this repeatedly - though Mulder is becoming gradually aware of a strong sense of dj vu. And something starts to happen that seems to confirm this: each time, Bernard's girlfriend PAM desperately tries to warn Mulder not to go in the bank - she seems to be the only one who remembers what is happening, and it is hell for her. She tells Mulder that she's tried stopping Bernard, tried calling the police, but nothing ever works - Mulder is the only variable. She begs him not to go in the bank, telling him that "something went wrong on this day the first time around." And it's going to keep repeating until it goes right.

Pam's words sink in, finally - the next time he sees Bernard, Mulder remembers the bomb, remembers the outcome of this Monday. He calls Scully for help, asking her to bring Pam into the bank. The three attempt to talk Bernard out of it, tell him to just walk away - but Bernard reacts the same way he always does - he shoots at Mulder. Only this time, Pam jumps in front of the bullet. It hits her in the chest and she drops to the ground, saying "This never happened before." She dies - and the day is over.

Mulder awakes the next day on his couch - it's Tuesday.

Welcome to "The Falls at Arcadia", one of the nation's top-rated planned communities. Unfortunately, three couples have vanished from the neighborhood over the past seven years. So Mulder and Scully go undercover and pose as new home buyers to investigate the strange disappearances.

Helpful residents Big Mike, a veterinarian, and next-door neighbors, Win and Cami Schroeder, help Mulder and Scully get squared away on move-in day. But Win balks when Mulder wants to erect a portable basketball hoop; this definitely goes against the community's strict regulations. Win suggests that Mulder take up the issue with Homeowner president, Gene Gogolak.

When Big Mike suddenly disappears, the Shroeders simply explain to Mulder and Scully that he went away on business. Scully and Mulder pay a visit to Gogolak, who tells them that regulations forbid the basketball hoop in the front driveway. He explains that rules are rules, and though it may seem tough to get used to, there's is a system that works. Mulder then changes the subject to Gogolak's decor. Gogolak explains that most of his antiques are Nepalese and Tibetan; he owns Pier 9 Imports and travels to the Far East often for business.

The Shroeders invite Mulder and Scully to dinner and Mulder presses the issue of Big Mike's disappearance. When Cami becomes uncomfortable with the topic and excuses herself to take the dog out, Scully accompanies her. During their walk, the dog gets loose and scrambles into a nearby storm drain. As Scully tries to fish out the lost pooch, she finds a caduceus necklace worn by Big Mike covered in what appears to be blood.

Scully has the "blood" analyzed, only to find that it is basically garbage; the neighborhood was built atop an old landfill. Mulder theorizes that the Klines are buried in the yard somewhere, and while digging a hole to find them, he dredges up a Malaysian artifact with a sticker showing that it came from Pier 9 Imports. Mulder confronts Gogolak with the theory that Gogolak, while on the trips to Far East, learned of the tulpa, or Tibetan thought-form, a creature willed into existence by one who possesses the ability. He believes Gogolak created this creature formed by garbage to keep the residents in check. Meantime, back at home Scully is surprised by Big Mike - alive - who reveals that he was attacked by the creature, but managed to escape. He tells Scully that the creature is coming for her because her "husband" has broken the rules. Big Mike barricades Scully in the closet and fights off the approaching monster. The firing gunshots warn Mulder, who races home, with Gogolak in tow. Mulder stops to handcuff Gogolak to the mailbox before going inside to help Scully. But outside, Gogolak is attacked by his own creation - yet with his death, the tulpa dies as well, disintegrating at Mulder's feet.

Two crew members aboard the T'ien Kou, a Chinese freighter bound for Los Angeles, sneak into the cargo hold to investigate a large container. One of the crew members pokes at the container and agitates the animal inside to the point that they think it may have killed itself.

When the ship docks, an irate Dr. Ian Detweiler, the owner of the container, sees that a pool of blood has oozed out of the crate and is furious that the animal contained within may have been hurt. When they remove the outer locks and open it, however, it is the two crew members who lie dead at the bottom of the crate; the animal nowhere to be found.

Mulder is tipped off to the event and after some preliminary investigating, finds that the ship's manifest listed the animal as a dog. When he theorizes that a dog might have been responsible for the deaths of the two crewmen, Scully reminds Mulder that in order for that to have happened, the dog would've had to escape from the box, kill the two men, put them back inside and lock the crate behind them -- hardly the actions of man's best friend.

On board the T'ien Kou, Fish & Wildlife Department officer Jeffrey Cahn takes Mulder and Scully to meet Detweiler, who tells them that the dog is a Wanshang Dhole, a very rare breed of canid from Asia thought to be extinct for the past 150 years. Just as Detweiler is explaining that the dog does not have a predatory nature, a US F& W officer reports that another dog attack has occurred.

Mulder and Scully pay a visit to Karen Berquist, the canine behavioralist who gave Mulder the tip about the first murders - she and Mulder had been communicating via the Internet. They hope Berquist might be able to shed some light onto the behavior of the animal. As they wait in her library, Scully notes a copy of the "I WANT TO BELIEVE" poster hanging on Berquist's wall. When Berquist finally arrives, she is less than hospitable. She tells the agents that while some canids use tricks to draw out their prey, they do not possess the intelligence to murder; murder is a human behaviorism. While Mulder believes Berquist, Scully is suspicious of her motives, thinking that Berquist may have tipped off Mulder so that she could meet him.

The assaults continue -- a U.S. F & W officer and a veterinarian are attacked and killed. Detweiler maintains that the dog can be captured but Cahn is incensed and wants the animal killed. Then Cahn himself is attacked but somehow manages to escape death and is rushed to the hospital.

Mulder finds Detweiler in Cahn's hospital room and confronts him with the theory that it is Detweiler who is responsible for the murders. Mulder posits that while Detweiler was in Asia hunting the Dhole, the Dhole found and attacked him instead, turning him into a shapeshifting trickster who can take the form of an animal. Detweiler denies Mulder's outrageous theory and leaves. Mulder then repeats his ideas to Berquist who confirms them. She tells Mulder to stay at the hospital and guard Cahn; Detweiler will want to come back and put down the threat he failed to eliminate by attacking Cahn.

Hours pass, but Detweiler never returns. Mulder realizes that Berquist lied to him. Detweiler, feeling a much larger threat from Berquist, has gone to Berquist's home to kill her. Once there, he takes the shape of the wild dog and attacks. Berquist stands her ground, and as the dog leaps, Berquist falls backward through the second-story window. When Mulder and Scully arrive, they find both Berquist and Detweiler dead.

Yet Berquist leaves somewhat of a legacy to Mulder. Upon his return to Washington, he receives a package in the mail - her copy of the symbolic "I WANT TO BELIEVE" poster that Mulder had lost in the fire.

@{fg shine}Trevor [#133]@{fg text}

Inside a prison compound in Stringer, Mississippi, two inmates, Rawls and Whaley, hurriedly board up barracks windows as stormy-and possibly tornadic-weather approaches. Rawls and Whaley get into an argument, and as a guard looks on, Rawls drives a nail through Whaley's hand. Rawls is brought before the superintendent, Robert Fellowes, who sentences him to "the box." As the wind howls, and the sky grows darker, Rawls begs to be let out of his tiny prison. But no one comes to his aid. After the storm passes, the guard finds that "the box" has been blown to oblivion. He makes his way to Fellowes' office to relay the news. Inside, he discovers Fellowes' body, which has been severed in half.

Scully and Mulder examine the remains inside a morgue. Though Fellows' body is cut across the torso, not a drop of blood was discovered inside the office. Scully is at a loss to explain his condition, except for the possibility of spontaneous combustion. The agents speak with the prison guard, who relays his theory that the ghost of Pinker Rawls is responsible for the murder. Mulder disagrees with the theory. He believes Rawls is very much alive. Shortly thereafter, Mulder discovers an irregularity in the wall of Fellowes' office. He applies some pressure to the area causing a hole the size of a man to open. The agents then discover a photo of Rawls and his girlfriend, June, amongst his possessions. Meanwhile, June learns of Rawls' presumed death while watching a television news broadcast.

Rawls breaks into a department store to steal some clothes. A security guard catches him in the act and handcuffs him to a steal beam. But Rawls escapes from his binds and makes off in the security guard's car. A short time later, the agents arrive at the scene. The security guard identifies Rawls as the suspect. Mulder then examines the still-closed handcuffs and whacks the ends against the steel beam. They shatter like glass. Meanwhile, Rawls makes his way to a dilapidated house rented by his old friend, Bo. It turns out that Rawls is looking for June, whom Bo ended up having an affair with. Bo pulls out a gun and fires, striking Rawls in the heart. But the bullets have no effect.

The agents discover Bo's faceless body inside his home. They assume that Rawls is after the $90,000 he made off with during a robbery years earlier. Mulder discovers tiny silver globules imbedded in the wall of the house. Mulder hypothesizes that the bullets travel right through Rawls without harming him and that Rawls is capable of moving through solid objects.

A short time later, Rawls pays June's sister, Jackie, a surprise visit. Jackie grabs hold of a knife and barricades herself inside her bedroom. Rawls strips off his clothes and, when Jackie isn't looking, enters the room by passing through a wall. Mulder and Scully arrive at the house, saving Jackie from harm. The agents then head for June's house. Unbeknownst to them, Rawls stowed away in the trunk of their car (by passing through the metal).

June admits it was she who came upon Rawls' $90,000 while he was in prison. She spent the money on a down payment for her house. Later, when Mulder opens the trunk of his car, he notices a cracking noise. He pokes the lid with his finger, and it crumples. Mulder instructs two troopers to place June under constant guard. A short time later, he and Scully reenter June's house, where they happen upon the writing "I Want What's Mine," scrawled across a wall. Mulder assumes Rawls used his finger to create the message. He notices that the final "e" ends where a mirror hangs on a wall. Putting the pieces together, he realizes that Rawls' power is electrical in nature, and can be stopped by an insulator, such as glass or rubber. He and Scully discover unpaid hospital maternity bills amongst June's possessions. They realize that Rawls isn't after money-he's after his son, Trevor.

Rawls morphs though the ceiling of June's hotel room. By the time the agents arrive, June and Rawls are gone and the state trooper guarding the room is dead. Meanwhile, Rawls tells June that he heard about the existence of his son from a fellow inmate. He demands that she take him to see the child.

The agents realize that Jackie is caring for June's son. Unfortunately, Rawls arrives at Jackie's house before they do. Jackie hurls boiling soup at Rawls' face, but the liquid passes through it. Jackie then swings the pan and the glass connects with his head. Trevor runs out the door with Rawls in close pursuit. Mulder and Scully arrive at the scene. Mulder shoots Rawls with rubber bullets, which slows him down. Scully makes off with Trevor, but Rawls follows. Thinking quickly, Scully takes refuge in a glass phone booth. Rawls is unable to pass through it, so he begins smashing the glass with a chunk of asphalt. Suddenly, June uses her station wagon to hit Rawls. He impacts on the passenger side of the windshield and is torn apart. Later, Mulder remarks that all Rawls really wanted was another chance.

@{fg shine}Milagro [#134]@{fg text}

While on her way to Mulder's apartment to discuss a murder case, Scully runs into Phillip Padgett, Mulder's new next door neighbor. Padgett is an odd bird - a writer who lives in his own mind; he gives Scully a creepy feeling.

The agents discuss the case and Mulder expresses his theory that the murder is a result of psychic surgery - the victim's heart was removed without any incisions, no prints, no forensic evidence of any kind left as clues. Scully, at best, is dubious.

When a similar murder occurs out on Lover's Lane, Mulder gets a hold of Scully who happens to be in Mulder's office where she finds that a pendant has been slipped inside an envelope under Mulder's door. It's a "milagro" - a lucky charm, with an image of a burning heart engraved on it. Scully feels it may be from the murderer and sets out to do some research.

At a nearby church, Scully is studying a painting of Christ with a flaming heart in his hands when she is approached by Mulder's neighbor, Padgett. He tells Scully he sent her the milagro, that he has been studying her for a character in his novel, and that he's become enamored of her.

Scully is both intrigued and disquieted by Padgett, yet is drawn to visit him on her way to Mulder's apartment. He seems to be getting underneath her skin when Mulder barges in, gun high, and arrests Padgett. It seems that the murders which they have been investigating coincide with personal ads taken out in a local paper; Padgett used the ads to find his victims. He also wrote about each murder, in detail, in his novel.

But another murder occurs while Padgett is locked up. Mulder is even more fervent in his belief that Padgett psychically communicated with a partner in crime, Dr. Ken Naciamento - the noted Brazilian psychic surgeon, and that somehow Padgett directed Naciamento to commit the crime. Mulder feels the only way to catch Padgett is to release him.

Back in his apartment, Padgett is visited by Naciamento. However, Mulder and Scully, who have set up a surveillance on Padgett's apartment, see nothing on the screen of Naciamento. Is he only a figment of Padgett's imagination or not? Naciamento coaxes Padgett into the realization that Scully must be killed. Padgett hurriedly finishes his novel, then heads for the basement incinerator to burn the pages. Mulder follows him there and is about to arrest Padgett when he hears a scream from above. It's Scully, who is being attacked by Naciamento. Mulder races to her side, finds her covered in blood, but alive. Padgett, on the other hand, lies at the foot of the incinerator, his heart removed and beating in his own hand.

The time: 1947. The place: Roswell, New Mexico. Members of an all-African-American baseball team, the Roswell Grays, face off against a team of all-white players during a "cactus league" night game staged in the middle of the desert. As Josh "Ex" Exley takes his turn at bat, the outfielders play deeper, leaving little doubt that Ex is the best player on the all-black team. The white pitcher, Moose, lets fly with a pitch. Ex catches a piece of the ball, and it soars out into the darkness. Having won the game, other black players mob Ex and hoist him onto their shoulders. Moments later, a large group of Ku Klux Klansmen, some mounted on horseback, invade the makeshift baseball diamond. The group's Grand Dragon makes it clear that his men are only interested in Ex, who, word has it, has come to the attention of the Yankees. Suddenly, Moose lets fly one of his 100-m.p.h. pitches, striking the Grand Dragon in the head and knocking him off his horse. Moose then targets the other Klansmen, knocking them unconscious. The coach of the black team pulls the hood off the Grand Dragon's head and reacts with horror when he discovers the face of a gray space alien beneath.

One Saturday, Scully finds herself assisting Mulder as he researches "flying disc" reports made in New Mexico in the 1940s. Scully soon realizes that her partner hasn't been researching U.F.O.s as he had claimed, but is studying fifty-year-old baseball scores. Mulder's attention is soon drawn to a newspaper page featuring a photograph of Ex standing near a young Arthur Dales and the alien bounty hunter. Mulder tears the page from the reference book and makes his way to Arthur Dales' apartment building. It turns out that Arthur Dales has moved to Florida, and his brother, who is also named Arthur, now resides in his apartment. Mulder shows Dales (Dales' brother will be referred to as "Dales" from here on) the old photograph. Dales, it turns out, worked as a police officer in Roswell during the 1940s. He identifies himself as the man standing next to Exley. Dales infers that both he and his brother have known about the bounty hunter's existence-and plans for the colonization of Earth-for some 40 years. He then begins to tell the tale he has kept secret for all those years.

In flashback, a young Arthur Dales enters a Roswell baseball stadium, carrying with him a racist pamphlet offering a reward for Exley's assassination. The pamphlet reads, "Keep Baseball Pure Keep It White." Dales approaches Exley and informs him that he has been assigned to provide him protection. Dales accompanies the team to a baseball stadium. As the game gets underway, the pitcher deliberately hurls a ball at Ex's head. Ex falls to the ground, dazed. Dales notices the pitcher's mitt nearby, the leather being eaten away by a greenish bubbling fluid. The still-dazed Ex states that he is from Macon, Georgia. Intrigued, Dales places a call to the Macon Police Department. He learns from a Macon Officer (his face unseen) that a six-year-old boy named Josh Exley disappeared fives years earlier from the town. As Dales finishes the call, the Unseen Macon Officer is revealed to be the alien bounty hunter. Dales then gives the catcher's mitt to a police chemist for analysis.

As the game gets underway, Ex realizes that a group of Yankee scouts are sitting in the stands. He deliberately plays a poor game, and the scouts finally give up and exit the stands. Once they leave, Ex again plays like his old self. Afterward, Dales approaches Ex and promises to find out what he is hiding. Later that night, Dales is awakened in his motel room by a banging from the room next door. Dales jimmies open the door connecting the two rooms and discovers an alien clad in boxer shorts and a baseball cap swinging a bat. Dales faints.

When Dales regains consciousness, he realizes that the alien is, in fact, Josh Exley. Exley tells Dales that he lived in Macon until the day he fell hopelessly in love with the game of baseball. From that day forward, he could not go home again. Meanwhile, the bounty hunter, having assumed Exley's form, kills the police chemist and destroys his lab work. A short time later, Dales informs the real Exley about the murder. Dales is certain Exley is not the killer, this despite an eyewitness account of the attack. Dales tells Exley to leave town. With that, Exley announces his retirement from the game. Before he disappears, Exley asks Dales to tell people about how he played the game. A short time later, Dales discovers a paper nearby, one addressed to him in Exley's handwriting. Inside is a map of Roswell, which contains a drawing of a baseball diamond. Home plate is some thirty miles from the town.

The story picks up where it left off in the opening teaser: people reacting in horror at the sight of the unhooded KKK gray alien. Suddenly, the alien morphs into the bounty hunter. Armed with a stiletto, the bounty hunter approaches Exley. Dales drives to the baseball diamond in the desert. But he arrives too late: the bounty hunter plunges the blade into Exley's neck. Exley warns Dales to stay away from him, fearful that his bubbling green blood will burn his skin. But Dales shows Exley that the blood isn't green or caustic: it is very much human red blood. Exley smiles softly then dies.

When the Older Dales finishes telling his story, Mulder telephones Scully and arranges for her to meet him at a public ball field in Washington. As an early birthday present, Mulder shows Scully how to hit a baseball. The pair laugh, knocking ball after ball into the dark sky.

@{fg shine}Three Of A Kind [#136]@{fg text}

Byers recounts a dream in which he lives in the perfect house with his two little daughters and wife, Susanne Modeski. But his dream always ends the same way: the house, children and Susanne disappear, and all he is left with is a man's wedding ring.

The Lone Gunmen go undercover in Las Vegas when a defense contractors' convention comes to town. The threesome hope to ascertain confidential information about the industry by infiltrating its inner sphere. Byers accesses a poker game by passing himself off as an employee of Conglomerated Technologies. He receives help from Frohike, who is disguised as a casino employee. Unbeknownst to the other players, Byers' eyeglasses contain a tiny transmitter, allowing Langly, who is surrounded by laptops in his hotel room, to feed him information whenever someone discusses the defense contracting business. Unfortunately, the dealer outsmarts and exposes Byers by inquiring about a process that doesn't exist. As a result, Byers and Frohike are escorted out of the building by security.

The Lone Gunmen regroup in their hotel room. They receive a visit from Jimmy and Timmy, two card-carrying conspiracy geeks. Both men admit that their efforts to crack the contractors' inner circle was unsuccessful. Later, as Byers and Frohike walk through a casino floor, Byers notices Modeski off in the distance. He runs towards her, but collides with an older man and falls to the floor. When he rises, Modeski has disappeared. The Lone Gunmen telephone Scully and, using a synthesized voice program, trick her into believing that she is speaking to Mulder. "Mulder" requests that she fly to Las Vegas. When the call ends, Byers explains to the others that Mulder's high-profile presence would tip off the black operatives who kidnapped Modeski in Baltimore ten years earlier. A short time later, Byers watches as the dealer from the poker game kisses Susanne Modeski outside their hotel room.

Using his laptop, Frohike accesses the hotel's records. He learns that the room in which Modeski is staying is registered to a Grant Ellis. It is determined that Ellis is linked to an advanced weapons facility located in New Mexico. Byers concludes that Modeski has been brainwashed, a victim of the "psychological warfare" gas she invented. The group splits up to find out if Byers' theory is correct.

Langly and Byers are unable to infiltrate a private event being held by the defense contractors due to their previous run-in with security. They turn to Jimmy the Geek for help. Jimmy crawls through a ventilation duct to spy on the proceedings. To his surprise, he discovers Timmy amongst the group. Jimmy is taken into custody. Timmy places a medical injection gun behind Jimmy's ear and pulls the trigger. A short time later, the Lone Gunmen learn that Jimmy threw himself in front of a bus. Meanwhile, Frohike sneaks inside Ellis and Modeski's room to plant a recording device. He discovers the presence of a camcorder already hidden inside an air vent. He pops out the tape and crawls to safety.

Scully arrives at the hotel and, at the Lone Gunmen's request, begins to perform an autopsy on Jimmy's body. She comes upon a faint mark just behind Jimmy's ear. Moments later, Timmy sneaks up behind Scully, places the injection gun behind her ear, and pulls the trigger. When Scully regains consciousness, her personality has changed to that of an airhead.

Modeski pays the Lone Gunmen a visit. She tells Byers that she met and fell in love with Grant when she realized that he was working against the forces who were exploiting her work. She explains how she and Grant had intended to use the Las Vegas conference to expose the group. But the existence of the tape changes everything, as the operatives are aware of the plan. She is certain they will kill Grant and herself. Shortly thereafter, Modeski observes a red mark behind Scully's ear. She realizes that Scully was injected with her latest creation, a derivative of the E-H gas. But only she and Grant were aware of the derivative's existence meaning Grant is behind the scheme. Modeski injects Scully with an antidote. Frohike realizes that the operatives drugged Scully to make her forget about the autopsy findings. He also realizes that Jimmy's death was not accidental. Unbeknownst to anyone, Langly has also been given an injection of the brainwashing compound.

Timmy instructs the brainwashed Langly to assassinate Modeski during a conference. As participants mill about, Langly opens fire, striking Modeski in the chest. Scully rushes to Modeski's side. She orders that Grant be detained. Moments later, Frohike and Byers, dressed as paramedics, rush Modeski away. Grant is led to a hotel room where Modeski greets him. It turns out that the "assassination" had been staged with blank bullets and fake blood. Langly, it is revealed, had been given the antidote. Unfortunately, Timmy senses something isn't right. He leans over the "blood" on the conference room floor and tastes it. His suspicions are confirmed. He enters the hotel room and shoots Grant. He then turns the weapon towards Modeski. During the confusion, Byers presses the injector gun to Timmy's ankle, and he falls to the floor. Later, a television news anchor reveals that Timmy was arrested for the deaths of Grant and Susanne Modeski.

Byers gives Modeski her new identity: Holly Fitzgerald. Susanne asks him to come with her as she begins her new life. But Byers believes she will be safer without him. With that, Susanne gives Byers a wedding ring, which had been intended for Grant.

@{fg shine}Field Trip [#137]@{fg text}

A young couple, Angie and Wallace Schiff, return to their motel after spending the day hiking through the woods. Tired and suffering from a headache, Angie decides to take a shower. Suddenly, the white fiberglass walls begin to ooze straw-colored goo. Just as suddenly, the walls return to normal. Angie dismisses the experience as fatigue from her headache. Moments later, she finds herself inside a dark place, with goo covering her eyes and mouth. Angie finishes her shower and sits with her husband. Still shaken by the imagery, she asks him to hold her. Later, the couple's skeletons turn up in a wilderness field.

Mulder reviews the Schiff's death with Scully. He notes that the skeletons were found three days after they disappeared from the motel. Scully hypothesizes that the Schiff's fell victim to a ritualistic killer, one who placed the bodies in acid and stripped away the flesh, leaving behind only bone. As the bodies were found in the Brown Mountain region of North Carolina, Mulder suspects a connection between the deaths and strange, unexplained lights that have been seen on the peak of the mountain for some seven hundred years. Scully wonders why her partner won't-just once-accept the simplest explanation. Mulder reminds her that ninety-nine percent of the time, his theories have proven correct.

The agents travel to Asheville, North Carolina, where they observe the Schiff's skeletal remains. Scully asks the coroner about a strange, gooey substance clinging to the bones. The coroner believes the substance is an organic material from the swampy area where the remains were discovered. Mulder leaves Scully at the morgue and travels to the wilderness area for further investigation. As Mulder's vehicle traverses the field, the tires crush some puffball mushrooms, which emit some small spores. Moments after exiting the SUV, Mulder notices Walter Schiff, very much alive, in the distance. Schiff runs off. Mulder follows him into a cave, and soon loses sight of him. When Mulder turns around, the mouth of the cave has vanished, and in its place is solid granite. Confused, Mulder looks about for the exit.

A lab analysis reveals that the gooey substance found on the Schiff's bones is the digestive secretion of a plant. Scully borrows the coroner's truck and sets off to find Mulder. As she traverses the field, she steps upon the mushrooms, which emit more spores. Meanwhile, as Mulder searches for the cave exit, he again encounters Wallace. He claims that the skeletons are fakes, and were planted in the field by an alien race. A short time later, Wallace points out the cave entrance, which moments earlier had been solid rock. Suddenly, a beam of light blasts through the entrance. Certain the light is emanating from the aliens, Wallace runs off into the cave. Mulder follows. In reality, the source of the light beam is the tiny flashlight in Scully's hand. Scully calls out to her partner, but receives no reply. Mulder and Wallace happen upon Angie, her body lying on the stone floor of the cave. She claims to have been abducted by aliens and subjected to tests. Shortly thereafter, the blinding light returns. This time, Mulder heads into the light.

Meanwhile, Scully makes her way to Mulder's apartment. Upon finding her disheveled partner inside, she demands an explanation for why he deserted her in North Carolina. Mulder introduces Scully to Wallace and Angela. He tells her that he has finally discovered "the truth" he has been searching for. He then leads Scully into his bedroom, where a small gray alien sits in the darkness. Scully congratulates her partner for being right about everything all along. Mulder reacts with surprise. He cannot believe that Scully is accepting his conclusions. Moments later, Mulder watches as Scully melts away. In reality, Mulder is not in the apartment, but in some dark place, dreaming in a comatose state.

Scully returns to the cave, this time in the company of the coroner, who is familiar with the wooded area. They discover a human skeleton, which is presumed to be Mulder's. Dental x-rays confirm the worst. Scully believes that Mulder may have fallen victim to the digestive secretion. She makes her way to Mulder's apartment, where mourners have gathered to pay their respects. The Lone Gunmen promise Scully they will find the man responsible for the ritualistic murder. Scully stares at them, exasperated. She insists that murder is not the "obvious answer" behind Mulder's death. Scully demands to know where Mulder has gone. With that, Mulder shows up at the front door.

Mulder informs Scully that he was abducted by aliens and teleported to his apartment. Scully points out the illogic to this scenario. She concludes that they are both experiencing some sort of hallucination, perhaps triggered by wild mushrooms growing in the North Carolina field. She fears they are both, in reality, trapped underground, being digested. With that, Mulder regains consciousness and pulls himself from the wet earth. He then rescues Scully from her nearby cocoon. The agents meet with Skinner to discuss the case. He notes that "it is a rare day" when both agents sign off on the same report. This observation troubles Mulder. He wonders how he and Scully were able to will their way to consciousness and concludes that, in reality, they are still trapped underground. To prove his point, Mulder fires his gun at Skinner. Goo oozes from Skinner's wounds. Not a moment too soon, the real Skinner locates the agents. Scully and Mulder are placed on stretchers and loaded into an ambulance. Mulder gains enough strength to grab Scully's hand. Scully squeezes back.

@{fg shine}Biogenesis [#138]@{fg text}

On a beach in West Africa, a Yelling Man alerts a group of fishermen to the discovery of a piece of metal embedded in some rock. The object, which is the size of a candy bar, contains a series of symbols. Its edges suggest that is has broken off a larger chunk of metal.

Dr. Solomon Merkmallen makes his way to the tide pool, where the same group of fishermen await. Inside his university office, Solomon extracts the metal piece from the rock. He places it next to a matching artifact, which contains similar iconic symbols. As Solomon moves the pieces towards each other, they suddenly fly from his fingers and embed themselves in a bible. The rip mark made by the now-fused object highlights a passage from Genesis. Solomon makes his way to the American University in Washington, D.C. where he meets with a Dr. Sandoz inside a biology lab. As the pair converse, Solomon realizes the man standing before him is not Dr. Sandoz. Later, the real Dr. Sandoz discovers Solomon's body.

Skinner discusses Solomon's death with Mulder and Scully. Although Solomon's body is missing, a large amount of his blood was discovered inside the biology lab. Both Solomon and Dr. Sandoz believed that life on Earth originated elsewhere in the universe. Skinner hands Scully a piece of paper containing a carbon rubbing of the (second) artifact Solomon had in his office. A short time later, Mulder hears a cacophony of sound in his head. He quickly recovers from this mysterious episode. Scully wonders why Mulder still has any interest in pursuing "the truth" now that the Syndicate members are dead and their secrets exposed. Mulder explains that there is one more thing he hopes to find: his sister.

Mulder interviews the man who had earlier posed as Dr. Sandoz. That man, Dr. Barnes, is the head of the biology department at the university. Scully hands Barnes the carbon rubbing which causes Mulder to experience another episode. He quickly excuses himself. Meanwhile, inside a hospital, Dr. Sandoz watches over Albert Hosteen, the Native American Navajo who assisted Mulder many years earlier. Hosteen is gravely ill.

Mulder meets with Scully and Chuck Burke, who analyses the symbols on the carbon rubbing. Burke declares that the writing is phonetic Navajo, but a literal interpretation is impossible. It turns out that Dr. Barnes authored an article on the manufacture of religious artifacts, and has made a career out of exposing scientific and religious fraud. Moments later, Mulder experiences another attack. He tells Scully that the attacks have given him a special "sense." He is convinced that Barnes murdered Solomon. He and Scully travel to Dr. Sandoz's apartment, where they find a photo of Sandoz posing with Albert Hosteen. They also find Solomon's body inside a trash compactor. The agents discuss their findings with Skinner. Mulder believes Solomon's body was planted in the compactor to frame Sandoz. He also believes that Sandoz possesses an actual artifact, as does Dr. Barnes. Lab tests reveal that Solomon was exposed to radiation that only exists beyond the solar system. That radiation, according to Mulder, originated from the artifact. Before the meeting concludes, Mulder accuses Skinner of secretly operating in conjunction with another party. After the agents leave the office, Skinner moves to a small pinhole camera mounted in the wall. He ejects a tape from a VCR and hands it to Alex Krycek.

Mulder returns to the American University. He searches Barnes' office for the artifact, but comes up empty handed. Mulder suffers an intense attack that affects his vision. He collapses on a stairwell. Moments later, a dark figure steps over Mulder's body. Mulder, who is unable to see or hear, cannot identify the form. The figure turns out to be Krycek. He makes his way to Barnes' office and hands him the surveillance tape that Skinner gave him.

Sandoz tells Scully that the metal piece is only a part of a much larger puzzle. Solomon found two more pieces in the tidal pool. Hosteen was given a rubbing made from those pieces. Together, the elements formed a passage from Genesis. Hosteen was working on more translations when his health deteriorated. Scully telephones Mulder' apartment. An unidentified woman answers and hands Mulder the phone. Mulder tells his partner that the artifacts are extraterrestrial in origin proving that mankind's progenitors are alien. The unidentified woman turns out to be Diana Fowley. Later, she contacts the Cigarette Smoking Man and reports that Mulder is suffering from attacks.

Scully and Sandoz accompany Hosteen to a place of healing in New Mexico. Skinner contacts Scully by phone and informs her of Mulder's deteriorating condition. When Scully reaches the hospital, she learns that Mulder has been confined to a psychiatric ward. Scully becomes suspicious of Skinner and Fowley and their interest in the case.

Dr. Sandoz telephones Scully. He informs her that the letters Hosteen translated from the artifact are a map to the genetic makeup of mankind. Krycek shoots and kills Dr. Sandoz.

Scully stands amongst the group of fishermen. She shows them the carbon rubbing. The Yelling Man points her in a direction further up the beach. Scully reaches the tide pool where it is revealed that she is standing on a massive craft buried in the sand, its surface covered with the strange symbols.

On the beach of Africa's Ivory Coast, Scully tries to piece together the cryptic symbols on the surface of the beached spaceship, hoping to find some answers to save the life of her ailing partner. Mulder contracted his illness after coming in contact with a carbon rubbing from the craft. While working late one night she does not notice a primitive African warrior who appears and then disappears. Thousands of bugs instantly swarm inside the tent. The next morning, an African biology professor named Amina Ngebe arrives at the camp to help Scully with the research. Amina warns Scully not to tell the African men hired to unearth the spaceship about the bugs because they would consider it an omen. After that, one of the workers in the ocean screams in pain as if he had been boiled in the water. At the sight of his blistered skin, Amina tells Scully that this is another warning.

Skinner goes to visit Mulder in the padded cell of a Washington hospital. He tries to speak to him, but Mulder attacks and is placed in restraints. Outside the cell, Skinner realizes he has a note in his pocket: a ripped cloth with the words "help me" written in dried blood. He sees Mulder again and manages to discern a name. Although reluctant at first, Michael Kritschgau is persuaded by Skinner to see Mulder. Kritschgau explains that he has witnessed this condition before in a CIA study of ESP. The electrical impulses in Mulder's brain are working harder than his body can sustain. Kritschgau has Skinner inject Phenytoin, causing an immediate effect in awakening Mulder. Diana Fowley attempts to intervene but Skinner, in an attempt to keep his dealings with Kritschgau secretive, dismisses her. Kritschgau puts a more responsive Mulder through a battery of tests with video monitors to determine his brain's over-activity and psychic ability.

Dr. Barnes arrives at Scully's tent to help her read the symbols but she is wary of him. The water around the spaceship turns into blood--another omen--and again Scully sees the manifestation of the primitive African man. Scully and Amina figure out that the symbols describe human genetics and ancient religious passages. In a delirious frenzy, Barnes claims that the spaceship is the ultimate source of power--the source of life itself--and traps the two women in the tent to ensure that he gets all the credit. Barnes' sack rumbles underneath a table. The fish he caught have magically come back to life, but only in Barnes' mind. This proves to him his theory that the spaceship is an animating force. Scully takes advantage of the opportunity to hit Barnes so that she and Amina can escape. The women frantically drive for help, but on the desolate road Scully sees the primitive African man in their path. She yells for Amina to stop the car, but the man has disappeared. Suddenly the man is in Amina's place and tells Scully, "Some truths are not for you." In the next instant he turns back into Amina. Scully tells her that she needs to get home.

Skinner and Kritschgau inject Mulder with an even greater dose in order to free him from the hospital. But when Diana rushes in with the doctor to confront Skinner, Mulder lapses into violent convulsions. Early the next morning, Diana pledges her love to the sedate Mulder. She vows to help him and not let him die. As she leaves, Mulder's eyes follow her -- he cannot speak, but he has heard every word she said.

At the beach, Barnes' driver comes into the seemingly empty tent and Barnes slashes him in the neck with a machete. Barnes places the man's body in the spot where the fish came to life. Later, Barnes discovers the driver's body gone and he goes out to the shoreline to look for him. The driver has returned to life, and strikes Barnes with the same machete.

Scully goes to Skinner in Washington and demands to see Mulder. Skinner tries to convey Mulder's impending death. Scully responds that Mulder is more alive than ever, acknowledging that the cause may be extraterrestrial. Skinner warns her that the security in the hospital will deny her access. An emotional Scully pleads with Mulder to hold on. He is unresponsive.

Amina returns to the beach with the police. They find Barnes' body in the ocean, but the spacecraft has disappeared.

@{fg shine}The Sixth Extinction, Part 2 : Amor Fati [#140]@{fg text}

Mulder dreams about a young couple teaching their son to walk on a beach. In reality, Mulder is still in the hospital, lying in a coma. His mother tries to speak to him and receives no response. Mrs. Mulder doesn't hear her fully alert son calling out to her in his head. But the Cigarette-Smoking Man knows Mulder can read his thoughts. He injects Mulder's head with a serum that allows Mulder to move and speak. CSM offers his hand. Mulder again envisions the toddler on the beach as the words of CSM lull him: "Take my hand because I am your father."

Scully is working round-the-clock to find the cause of Mulder's illness, when Kritschgau sneaks into the office. He explains that exposure to the spacecraft's energy has activated the alien virus injected into Mulder two years ago. Kritschgau demands Scully's research, but they are interrupted by a phone call from Skinner: Mulder has disappeared from the hospital. She hurries to the hospital and learns that it was Mulder's mother who has checked him out. Skinner tells Scully that he must remove himself from the case and from knowledge of the agents' whereabouts. Skinner's position has been compromised. Mulder again sees the boy on the beach, and awakens to find himself in CSM's car. CSM tells him that doctors have worked on him, and the only way he can be saved from death is to disappear into a kind of witness protection program. CSM pulls up to a suburban street and points out Mulder's new life. CSM offers him the chance to return to his previous existence with the X-Files, but Mulder is curious about this new home. He is pleased to find a refrigerator stocked with his favorite sunflower seeds. As he pops one into his mouth, he is startled by the presence of an old ally -- Deep Throat. Deep Throat boasts about his peaceful life in this neighborhood and encourages Mulder to join him. But Mulder is overwhelmed with guilt for his causing this man's supposed death. Deep Throat tells him not to feel responsible for his death or the deaths of Mulder's father, Scully's sister and Duane Barry. Deep Throat explains that they the two of them are merely puppets in a master plan. He coaxes Mulder to relax and enjoy his new life.

Scully finds the Navajo elder Albert Hosteen in her apartment. Hosteen warns her that she must save Mulder for the sake of mankind. Scully returns to the hospital. She reviews a surveillance tape of Mulder's room where she can see through the mostly covered monitors that Mulder's mother is talking to someone with a cigarette. This convinces Scully that CSM is behind Mulder's disappearance. At the FBI, Scully receives an inter-office envelope containing a book on Native American practices. The symbols on the book's cover match the ones she had been studying on the spaceship in Africa. She reads a myth foretelling a mass extinction with a man who can save the world from this tragedy. She calls Skinner to question him as the source for this clue. Scully deduces that they took Mulder because they think his illness is protection against a coming plague. An apprehensive Skinner hangs up on her. Scully runs up to his office and sees Skinner doubled over in pain, while a bearded man escapes. Scully goes to Kritschgau and admonishes him for revealing the secrets about Mulder's illness. Kritschgau has hacked into her computer files and explains that her research will prove that Mulder has biologically transformed into an alien.

Mulder has another vision of the beach. The boy is sad that his sand sculpture has been washed away by the tide. Mulder comforts him and encourages the boy to build it again. Mulder is awakened by Diana Fowley who comes to his bed, convincing him of the joys of marriage. They make love. The next morning, Diana tries to persuade Mulder that he should become a father. She brings him to CSM's house nearby and points out CSM's daughter, Samantha Mulder. Suddenly we are in an operating theater. CSM tells Diana that men like Mulder have dreams of a simpler life. He says this about the real Mulder, who lies on a table with his head strapped in a surgical device. This is where Mulder really is. The illusion of domestic, suburban bliss is only in his mind.

At the FBI, Scully tries to appeal to Diana for help, causing Diana to question CSM's motivation for using Mulder in the experiments. Albert Hosteen reappears in Scully's apartment. He tells her to look inside her heart for Mulder. The two pray together.

Still in his dream, Mulder's life progresses with Diana. He physically ages as he goes through their wedding, her pregnancy and children, and then her death. Mulder slips back into his subconscious where the sand sculpture has become a spaceship. The boy starts to smash the sculpture, telling him that it is really Mulder's spaceship and he is the one destroying it. A now aged Mulder wakes up to CSM at his bedside. CSM tells him that he should let go. As Mulder closes his eyes, the world outside is in full apocalypse. Yet in real life, Mulder and CSM are side-by-side on a medical table for some kind of procedure transplanting Mulder's alien genetic material into CSM.

The bearded man from Skinner's office kills Kritschgau and torches all his research. Only now is his identity revealed: it's Alex Krycek. An envelope is slid under Scully's door with a key card that leads Scully to the surgical facility where Mulder is being held. In Mulder's dream he is ready to give up, but Scully forces him to persist with their mission. In reality, Scully does come to the surgery room to save Mulder. She wakes him up and he draws strength from her presence. She helps him escape.

Scully checks up on the still weakened Mulder is in his apartment. He wears bandages on his head from the operation. He informs her that Albert Hosteen has died in New Mexico. This upsets Scully. She doesn't believe that her experience was imagined. Then Scully breaks her bad news to Mulder: Diana was murdered because she helped save him. Mulder is emotional, and reveals his dreams about another life without the X-Files. He admits to Scully that she was the only one who told him the truth in his dreams and that "even when my world was falling apart, you were my constant, my touchstone." She tells her partner that she feels the same way, then leaves. One more time, Mulder dreams of the boy on the beach. This time they are rebuilding a huge sandcastle spaceship together.

@{fg shine}Hungry [#141]@{fg text}

It is after midnight when an LTD pulls into the drive-through of Lucky Boy Burgers in Costa Mesa, California. The young guy at the wheel waits impatiently and receives only silence from the speaker. He calls out for service and the neon "open" sign instantly flickers out. Angered, the guy honks his horn. The microphone clicks on and a man says the restaurant is closed. The driver doesn't give up easily and yells threats to the speaker. The voice at the other end sheepishly tells him to drive through. The guy pulls up, but no one is there. So he leans out of his car to get a better look. In one quick instant, a monster appears in the window and ferociously yanks the guy from his car. The driverless car, still in gear, creeps toward a curb.

Three days later, Lucky Boy employee Rob Roberts pulls up to the restaurant and gives himself a pep talk before heading in. He works at the front register as Mulder and Scully approach, flashing their badges. They ask Rob's manager to round up the employees for questioning. They inform the group that a Lucky Boy Burger promotional button was found on a body in the trunk of a car. The employees, including Rob, all pull out their buttons. A thuggish-looking Derwood Spinks hides in the back, claiming he left his button at home. His co-workers eye Derwood suspiciously. Mulder and Scully clear out the restaurant and search the kitchen. They don't see Rob outside as he switches on the drive-through microphone and listens to their conversation at the menu board. Mulder theorizes that the victim's brain was sucked out by a tongue or some kind of proboscis. Scully is not convinced. Mulder spots dried blood under a counter. He is squeamish that it is brain matter. Scully notes that it is merely ground beef. Rob isn't settled by this news.

Rob comes home and rushes into the bathroom where he pulls from the bathtub a Lucky Boy uniform soaking in pink water. He cannot scrub out the blood stains and decides to dump the shirt. He is about to remove the trash bag when there is a knock at the door. Mulder wants to ask Rob a few more questions about his closing up the restaurant on the night of the murder. Rob complies, telling him that he dumped thirty-five pounds of spoiled beef that night. Out of the corner of his eye he catches the bloody water seeping out from the trash bag but Mulder doesn't see it. After Mulder leaves, Rob tosses the wet bag into a garbage truck outside. He realizes his hands are covered with dried blood and sucks his fingers, enjoying the taste. While doing so he notices a man parked across from the apartment building watching him. Rob nervously approaches, thinking the man is Mulder. The unidentified man tells Rob to get lost.

Back in the apartment, Rob's answering machine tapes a message from Dr. Mindy Rinehart, a psychiatrist assigned by Lucky Boy to aid its employees. He ignores the message, intently watching the man staked outside the building. Rob goes in the bathroom and pops out his triangle-shaped, shark teeth. As they clink in the sink, his stomach loudly growls. Later that night, Rob tries to overcome his hunger. He chomps on appetite suppressant gum and memorizes the words of a videotaped motivational speaker. But he is still starving. He goes outside to the man in the parked car and opens his toothless mouth. Needle-sharp teeth spring into place as he lunges at the man.

Rob is asleep on his couch the next morning when Derwood breaks in. He tells Rob that he has been fired from Lucky Boy. He also says that he found Rob's prescription bottle of diet pills in the restaurant the morning after the murder. He shows Rob the bottle and the bloody thumbprint on its cap. Derwood demands payment to keep his mouth shut. They are interrupted by a neighbor, Sylvia, who asks if Rob saw a man that had been parked outside. Rob dismisses her, and Derwood warns him not to skip town. Rob heads to his car and sees Mulder approaching. Although Mulder doesn't give any indication that he suspects Rob, he does tell him that the police believe that Derwood is the killer. Rob goes to Dr. Rinehart's office for his mandatory consultation. He can't concentrate as his stomach growls. When the doctor gets a call from Mulder, Rob bolts out, claiming he has to be at work.

Rob hallucinates that the burgers he is frying are brains. Derwood shows up at Lucky Boy to threaten Rob again. Scared of getting caught, Rob rummages through Derwood's house for the prescription bottle. When Derwood comes home, Rob hides in the closet. As Derwood approaches the closet armed with a baseball bat, Rob starts to dismember his fake human parts to reveal the monster underneath. Derwood opens the door and the monster's tongue lashes out, poking a hole through Derwood's forehead.

Rob goes to see Dr. Rinehart again and admits that he has an eating disorder. She writes down the location of an Overeaters Anonymous meeting. Rob's stomach growls and he rushes out, saying "I really am trying to do right." Dr. Rinehart ponders his statement. Rob returns home to find Mulder and Scully waiting to ask him about Derwood Spinks's disappearance. Mulder tells Rob that he believes the killer is some sort of genetic freak who feeds on humans, but Rob plays dumb.

With no other hope, Rob attends the Overeaters Anonymous meeting and runs into his neighbor, Sylvia. She encourages him to introduce himself. He describes in salacious detail his cravings for meat. The group members salivate. Rob stops when he spots a bald man in the front row. The man's brain seems to be throbbing through the skull, causing Rob to lick his lips in hunger. Rob makes a friend in Sylvia as he walks her to her apartment after the meeting. She says goodnight and closes her door. He turns to leave but his stomach begins to growl. He turns back to her door, knocks, and removes his teeth, ready for his next meal.

Rob makes a plan the next day. He demolishes his apartment with Derwood's baseball bat and screams in terror. He beckons his neighbors to call the police. Mulder and Scully arrive and listen to Rob's questionable story that Derwood threatened him to keep quiet. The agents ask Rob about a missing private eye hired by Sylvia's husband who was staked out in front of the building. Rob has no answers and quickly tells them that Sylvia is not at home.

Rob frantically packs his belongings when Dr. Rinehart shows up. She senses that Rob is at fault for the murders and tries to soothe him. Enraged, Rob begins to pull off his human body parts to show her his secret. Dr. Rinehart is horrified but still sympathetic. She touches his face. Suddenly, the door crashes in and Mulder and Scully enter with guns drawn. They yell for the doctor to move away, but she defends Rob and tells him to be the good person he means to be. Rob is hesitant, then lunges at the agents, knowing they will open fire. A dying Rob falls to the floor as Dr. Rinehart's eyes tear up. She asks him why he caused his own death. He whispers, "I can't be something I'm not."

At a memorial service in Tallahassee, Florida, a widow complains that her husband, Raymond Crouch, left no suicide note. She is greeted by Mark Johnson who tells her that he worked with the deceased. As the mourners file out of the funeral parlor, Johnson sneaks out from the shadows. He begins to undress the corpse and recites a passage from the Bible over and over like a mantra. Johnson switches on a cell phone and places it in the hand of the deceased, positioning the man's thumb over the "talk" button. Eight days later, on December 29, 1999. Johnson waits outside a cemetery. The rain splashes on his truck as he stares out at a freshly-laid gravesite. A cell phone on his dashboard chirps and, without answering it, Johnson pulls out a shovel and heads toward the tombstone.

The next day, Mulder and Scully are at the crime scene, examining the now dug up grave. The body of Raymond Crouch is gone. Scully notes the shredded lining inside the empty casket and comments that it looks like someone was trying to get out. Mulder confirms this by pointing out that the fingerprints
