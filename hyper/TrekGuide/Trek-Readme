   This will entitle you to receive the full version. It includes all the
   series' synopsis' from the original series, TNG, and DS9 and Voyager
   current as of the 1994-1995 season. There is a section on the cartoon
   series, Star Trek Voyager, and the Trek novels as well. Many more features
   yet to come!

                           Live Long and Prosper

                  "Star Trek" Created by Gene Rodenberry

                              ***************

                      ADDITIONS/FIXES TO VERSION 1.6
 
 - Lots of rough edges cleaned up.

 - You can now 'view' episodes in different series' without having
   to load the series node.

 - Some people were having problems getting the custom screen to open. 
   This should be fixed now.

 - Added the 'View' button to ALL pages.

 - Requester now appears during startup informing you that you had saved
   marked episodes from a previous session.

 - Added many more pics to the demo release for Next Generation node.

 - More episodes have aired since the previous release, so these have
   been added to the registered version.

 - Many small bug fixes in some of the arexx scripts.

                          ***********************

 This version contains cross references for episodes that have a story
 line pertaining to the Klingons, Romulans, Borg, Cardassians, Time
 Travel and a few more items.

 The next release, when I get time to get back to it, will also contain
 cross-references to the actors, directors and script writers as well.
 I will also have more photos including (for all you collectors out there)
 pics of very rare Star Trek collectables and current prices for these
 rarities.  I also hope that v2.0 will be a compiled version and NOT in
 amigaguide format.  This all depends on how much time I can dedicate to it
 between now and then.  For best results, KS 3.0 or later with AmigaGuide
 is recommended, but will work fine under AmigaGuide in KS 2.04+ versions
 as well.  It just won't have the fancy text attributes.

 If you happen to find the "SFX" buttons in a few of the episode, simply
 ignore them, as the sound clips are not being distributed as of yet.

 I would like to hear comments and/or suggestions from you, the user about
 what else you would like to see in the next release.

 Please EMail me at hines_j@wvlink.mpl.com

 Also, registered users will receive their updates via E-Mail. So let me 
 know your email address. If you don't have one, let me know and I'll 
 make other arrangements.

                                         Until next time.......Jim Hines
