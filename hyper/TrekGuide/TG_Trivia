 @{fg shine}United States@{fg text}

 Star Trek (Originals) is distributed to local stations by Paramount. It has
 been edited down in order to fit in more commercials, and is aired according
 to production code order, not according to original air dates.

 @{fg shine}Australia@{fg text}

 Both the original series and the animated series are shown on Channel 7, which
 has perpetual rights to the series.

 @{fg shine}England/United Kingdon@{fg text}

 The BBC is currently showing the original series Wednesdays at 6 PM, but is
 often pre-empted for sport coverage. "Miri" was shown only once, and it's
 airing caused a lot of mail from angry parents that the BBC decided to preview
 episodes before airing them. "Whom Gods Destroy", "The Empath", and "Plato's
 Stepchildren" were *never* shown in the UK, as they were deemed unsuitable for
 children.

 @{fg shine}Germany@{fg text}

 The series is titled "Raumschiff Enterprise", which, translated, means
 "Starship Enterprise". It started airing in 1972 (?) on the German Public
 Network ZDF, and, after not being aired for several years, the series began
 it's current run on July 1, 1993.  Part of the name change is because it would
 give the German viewer the idea of a western series in space, while the
 litterial translation, "Zug zu den Sternen", would have suggested a
 documentary. The episode, "Patterns Of Force" was not aired in Germany due to
 its Nazi theme, although SAT1 may air this episode.

 Incidentally, all references to the "Warp Drive" was changed to a "SOL drive"
 in ZDF version. However, the rights is now owned by SAT. 1 (a private
 network), and Warp drives are now referred to as Warp Drives.

 The opening into is:

 Der Weltraum, unendliche Weiten.
 Wir schreiben das Jahr 2200.
 Dies sind die Abenteuer des Raumschiffs Enterprise,
 das, mit seiner vier hundert Mann starken Besatzung
 fuenf Jahrelang unterwegs ist, um neue Welten zu erforschen,
 neues Leben, und neue Zivilizationen.
 Viele Lichtjahre von der Erde entfernt dringt die Enterprise
 in Galaxien vor, die nie ein Mensch zuvor gesehen hat.

 ... which, translated, is:

 Space, unending expanse.
 We write the year 2200.  [i.e., this is the year 2200 AD]
 These are the adventures of the spaceship Enterprise,
 which, with its four-hundred-man crew
 is five years long underway, in order to explore new worlds,
 new life, and new civilizations.
 Many light years distant from the earth, the Enterprise
 forges ahead into galaxies which no man has seen before.


 Some of the titles were changed in translation. Here are the new episodes
 with English titles on the left:

 The series is titled "Le Patrouille du Cosmos", which, translated, means

 @{fg shine}Sweden@{fg text}

 TOS is being shown on TV5/Nordic. They are currently (7/93) in the middle of
 season two.

 @{fg shine}Video Tape@{fg text}


 The entire series is also available uncut from Paramount Home Video, and
 includes the original promos for the following episode. The ordering of the
 tapes is according to production numbers, with "The Cage" considered to be
 episode one.

 @{fg shine}Laser Disc@{fg text}

 All 79 episodes+pilot are available from Paramount. They are packaged 2 to a
 disc, not in numerical order. If you want specific titles, catalog numbers,
 etc. "The Laser Video File" offers a complete listing, or they are available
 in electronic form from the Barr LD data base. The complete set of the
 animated series episodes is also available in a boxed LD set. Only the recent
 all-color release of The Cage has digital sound. Some of my discs were made by
 PVI in the US; some by PVC in Japan. The PVC ones are mostly in the second and
 third seasons, and tend to have fewer defects. Many don't even have CX,
 although some (mostly the later/PVC ones) do. The original TV trailers are
 enclosed. At least one of the trailers contains slightly different composition
 from the actual episode. On the positive side, the colors are significantly
 more saturated than the broadcasts.

 science lab Christmas party, and was reminded of it whem they visited the

 attraction to her were artificially swelled by Dr. Adams' Neural Neutralizer.

 @{"Conscience Of The King" link "TG_ORIG/CONSCIENCE_OF_THE_KING" 0} - Kirk forges, somewhat blantantly, a relationsip with
 Lenore Karidian, the daughter of Anton Karidian (also known as Governor Kodos

 end of the episode, Lenore goes insane.

 mirror Enterprise.

 @{"The Deadly Years" link "TG_ORIG/THE_DEADLY_YEARS" 0} - Although there was no real relationship offered between
 Kirk and Dr. Janet Wallace, a past romance was very definitely referred to.

 @{"A Private Little War" link "TG_ORIG/A_PRIVATE_LITTLE_WAR" 0} - Nona was an artificial relationship brought about by
 the drugs and charms of the mystic wie of Kirk's friend Tyree on the planet
 Neural. When Nona is killed while betraying her tribe, Kirk does not shed a
 tear.

 @{"The Gamesters of Triskelion" link "TG_ORIG/THE_GAMESTERS_OF_TRISKELION" 0} - Kirk gets involved with Shahna, a fellow
 "thrall", while in captivity on the planet Triskelion. And, as an example
 of Kirk being his stereotypical worst, he succeeds in convincing Shahna
 that personal freedom, idealism, and kissing is the way to love before
 leaving her (voluntarily) behind on Triskelion.

 @{"By Any Other Name" link "TG_ORIG/BY_ANY_OTHER_NAME" 0} - Kirk seduces Kelinda in an attempt to expose the

 @{"The Paradise Syndrone" link "TG_ORIG/THE_PARADISE_SYNDROME" 0} - Kirk, when he lost his memories, has a romance with
 Miramanee. In this case, Kirk was totally dedicated, sincere, and willing to
 settle down and be a family man in the Native American style. Of course, once
 Kirk regains his memories, this side of Kirk goes away. Miramanee was later
 killed.

 @{"Wink Of An Eye" link "TG_ORIG/WINK_OF_AN_EYE" 0} - This was a rather amusing, and probably a little ridiculous,
 romance between Kirk and Deela, a member of the accelerated Scalosian society.
 Deela, however, stays behind on Scalos.

 @{"Elaan of Troyius" link "TG_ORIG/ELAAN_OF_TROYIUS" 0} - Kirk was infatuated with Elaan of Elas, mainly due to the
 intoxicating effects of the chemical composition of Elann's tears. While Elann
 married the ruler of Troyius, Kirk gets over the intoxication by remembering
 that his first love is the Enterprise.

 @{"The Mark Of Gideon" link "TG_ORIG/THE_MARK_OF_GIDEON" 0} - Kirk is romancing Odona instead of interrogating her as
 to why the entire Enterprise crew has disappeared. Odona's purpose was to

 associated with the incident with Spock's mindmelding help.

 @{"Turnabout Intruder" link "TG_ORIG/TURNABOUT_INTRUDER" 0} - Dr. Janice Lester was another old relationship of Kirk's
 that was doomed to end because of Lester's domineering resentment of Kirk's
 superior capabilities as a starship Captain. Dr. Lester uses a device on Camus
 II to switch bodies with an unwilling Kirk. She later goes insane.

 Star Trek II - Dr. Carol Marcus was an old, serious romance of Kirks. He finds
 out that he had a son, David. This was an ralationship on Kirk's part, and his
 love for his ship and her love for her work would never allow them to be happy
 together. She continued on her scientific career.

 Star Trek IV - While on 20th century Earth, Kirk has a subdued, intellectual
 romance with Dr. Gillian Taylor, a cetacean biologist. However, once back in
 the 23rd century, they go their seperate ways.

 Mine/Prison. However, Kirk sees through Martia's deception, and Martia is

 Also, there was a 1933 film called "The Kennel Club Murder Case" starring
 William Powell as Philo Vance, who was a popular book/movie detective back
 then. In this film, there was a Doctor Finnegan, who made the comments "I'm a
 doctor, not a magician!", and "I'm a doctor, not a detective!"

 ...Nichelle Nichols was planning to leave Star Trek at the end of the first

 ...The Enterprise model is 11 feet in length, and weighs 200 pounds. The
 model is composed of plastic, wood, and rolled steel. The cost of materials,
 in 1964 dollars, was $600. The original designer of the ship is Walter "Matt"
 Jeffries, who based the ship's registry number, NCC-1701, on his 1935 Waco
 airplane (and whom the term "Jeffries Tubes" was invented for). After the
 series, the model was donated to the Smithsonian in 1974, and was restored due
 to the appearance of cracking paint, stress cracks, and failures in the
 lighting system. A "streaking effect" has been added to make a "weathered"
 look, but the paint has changed the model color from gray to green. The
 restoration process took six weeks.

                                @{b}@{i}SHAKESPEARE @{ub}@{ui}

 William Shatner was trained as Shakespearean actors. The problem with
 Shatner's acting is that he apparently has never made the transition in style
 from stage acting to television acting. His overacting and wild motions work
 fine on stage, just not as well on a TV set where the camera picks up every
 move much better. Patrick Stewart had the same problem during the first
 season, as I remember. William Shatner holds Sir Laurence Olivier as his
 favorite performer because of the late actor's technical skill and ability to
 project emotion. Olivier continues to be revered as the greatest modern
 Shakespearean actor.

 Anyways, there have been many references to Shakespeare on the original
 series, either though episode titles or through quotations by the characters.
 The key is that the title and reference are in quotations. The 2.1.39 means
 Act 2, Scene 1, Line 39.

 "@{"Dagger of the Mind" link "TG_ORIG/DAGGER_OF_THE_MIND" 0}" - This line is referenced in "Macbeth 2.1.39", and can
 be best sumarized in "Macbeth 2.1.34-50".

 "@{"The Conscience of the King" link "TG_ORIG/THE_CONSCIENCE_OF_THE_KING" 0}" - This line is referenced in "Hamlet
 2.2.606", and can be best sumarized in "Hamlet 2.2.589-606". This episode is
 based largely on _Hamlet_. The basic plot is similar, and there are many plot
 devices that are duplicated in the episode from the play, such as the troupe
 of actors. Additionally, many of Shakespeare's characters find analogs in Star
 Trek. Here is a list of crossovers: Hamlet -> Kirk, Claudius -> Karidian
 (Kodos), Ophelia -> Lenore, and Ghost of Hamlet's Father -> Tom Leighton

 This episode also contains several themes lifted from Macbeth, as one would
 expect since the episode opens with a scene from an "Arcturian Macbeth." The
 analogs seem to be: Macbeth -> Karidian, Lady Macbeth -> Lenore, and Macduff
 - Kirk

 Toward the end of the episode, the Karidian Company of Actors performs
 Hamlet. Karidian, playing Hamlet's father, speaks the lines from "Hamlet
 1.5.10-24", but, unforunately, omits several lines.

 Later, Lenore quotes the Soothsayer in "Julius Caesar 1.2.18&23":
 "Caesar, beware the Ides of March", and then paraphrases Fortinbras from
 "Hamlet 5.2.36-63"

 "@{"By Any Other Name" link "TG_ORIG/BY_ANY_OTHER_NAME" 0}" - Kirk says as he holds out a rose-like flower and
 says, "As the Earth poet Shakespeare wrote, `That which we call a rose by any
 other name would smell as sweet.'" This line comes from "Romeo and Juliet
 2.2.43-44"

 "@{"Elaan of Troyius" link "TG_ORIG/ELAAN_OF_TROYIUS" 0}" - The plot for this episode was taken from _The Taming
 of the Shrew_. As with "The Conscience of the King," some of Shakespeare's
 characters find analogs within the episode: Petruchio -> Kirk, and Katherine
 - Elaan

 "@{"Whom Gods Destroy" link "TG_ORIG/WHOM_GODS_DESTROY" 0}" - Martha quotes Shakespeare's eighteenth sonnet, which

 "@{"Charlie X" link "RG-ORIG/CHARLIE_X" 0}" - Kirk enters a turbolift with the boy Charlie, en route to the
 bridge, wearing his usual uniform shirt with the badge on the left breast.
 When they emerge from the lift, Kirk is wearing his yellow-green wrap-around
 shirt with the badge down near the waist. Yet for the rest of the show (after
 the bridge scene and some shirtless scenes in the Enterprise gymnasium) he
 retains his usual shirt.  Also, after Kirk talks with the chef, he is seen
 in a closeup, but the image is reversed (look at the hair part).  Then,
 Charlie is on McCoy's examination table, actively peddling. We switch to a
 camera view of the indicator panel, where a reflection of Charlie is shown,
 with Charlie motionless. The camera then cuts back to Charlie, who is fully
 active. Then, back to the panel, where shows Charlie's reflection motionless,
 and then back to Charlie.

 "@{"The Naked Time" link "TG_ORIG/THE_NAKED_TIME" 0}" - After Nurse Chapel infects spock with "the disease",
 Spock goes into the conference room to get control of his emotions. The
 doorplate on this room is on the LEFT side of the door. After Kirk enters, a
 bit of dramatics, Spock leaves, then Kirk leaves, we see that the doorplate
 has moved to the RIGHT side of the door.

 "@{"The Enemy Within" link "TG_ORIG/THE_ENEMY_WITHIN" 0}" - When he's on the planet, Kirk's gold shirt has the
 usual emblem on. When he beams back aboard, the emblem is missing. He swoons,
 and Scotty helps him out of the transporter room. After the break, we see
 Scotty and Kirk in the corridor, and the emblem is back. (The order of these
 may be reversed, but the emblem definitely "winks" in and out.)  Strange
 clothing changes.  Bad-Kirk's scratch on his face switches sides.
 When Bad-Kirk demands brandy from McCoy, the closeup show shows him with the
 Good-Kirk uniform  When Good-Kirk is holding bad Kirk on the transpoter
 pad, his hands are touching. Then he talks to Spock and his hands are apart.
 After that, a longshot shows his hands touching again.  When Bad-Kirk
 demands brandy from McCoy, the closeup show shows him with the Good-Kirk
 uniform.


 "@{"Mudd's Women" link "TG_ORIG/MUDD'S_WOMEN" 0}" - When the women are first beamed up to the Enterprise, it
 flashes back and forth between the women and Scott, Spock, and McCoy. If you
 watch it carefully, you will see that they spliced in a scene of McCoy
 standing in sick bay smiling, and he is wearing a different uniform and has
 the medical scanner behind him.

 "What Are Little Girls Made Of" - Strange clothing changes.

 "@{"The Menagerie" link "TG_ORIG/THE_MENAGERIE_PT.1" 0}" - The ONLY door handle seen in a Federation setting (ship
 or starbase, etc.) was on the door to Christopher Pike's quarters, which was
 kind of ironic, since he's about the only person who COULDN'T use a door
 handle!  Also, during the trial, every senior officer, including McCoy, is
 wearing dress uniforms, except for Scott, who is wearing his regular uniform.


 "@{"Shore Leave" link "TG_ORIG/SHORE_LEAVE" 0}" - As you watch the Kirk/Finnegan fight, ask yourself when
 Kirk's tunic gets ripped. You'll notice that just before we fade to a
 commercial, the camera is on Kirk, who is down and out, and his tunic is
 perfectly whole. Camera cuts to Finnegan, who is standing over Kirk, gloating.
 The camera cuts back to Kirk, whose tunic is ripped to shreds, and we fade to
 a commercial.  Maybe Kirk is Jewish, and rents his garment in anguish....
 Also, when Spock is beaming down, Sulu says, "Look, someone is beaming down
 from the bridge." How could they determine that someone was beaming down from
 the bridge, never mind that it wasn't possible in TOS times.  The yeoman
 gets her uniform torn by Don Juan, and then changes into the 'princess'
 costume. When she changes back into her uniform again, it has miraculously
 been repaired.  Spock and Kirk are discussing the tiger that was seen and
 it appears. BUT it clearly has a chain around its neck and when it gets up,
 the chain is clearly seen to extend toward the ground.  In the scene where
 the caretaker appears for the first time, you can see the shadow of a boom
 pass across the tree in the middle of the screen.

 "@{"The Galileo Seven" link "TG_ORIG/THE_GALILEO_SEVEN" 0}" - After Boma leaves to prepare for one of the burials,
 the camera stays on the shuttlecraft door as it closes. A propman's hand is
 very visible on the lower part of the door, guiding it into place.

 "@{"The Squire Of Gothos" link "TG_ORIG/THE_SQUIRE_OF_GOTHOS" 0}" - Trelane sees Earth's history about 900 years
 late, and talks about Alexander's Hamilton's death (July 12, 1804), and how he
 had admired Napoleon (who reigned from November 9, 1799-April 11, 1814; March
 20-June 18, 1815). This places the episode at around the 2700's, about a few
 hundred years after when TNG is stated to occur.

 "@{"Arena" link "TG_ORIG/ARENA" 0}" - When Kirk and Spock are taking cover, at the beginning, behind a
 destroyed section of wall, every time Kirk leans against the wall, it moves as
 if it's a styrofoam prop.

 "@{"Tomorrow is Yesterday" link "TG_ORIG/TOMORROW_IS_YESTERDAY" 0}" - First off, Kirk says that the "United Earth
 Space Probe Agency" was the authority behind the Enterprise. Next, when Kirk
 and Sulu hand their belts to the security guard, the antenna grids were
 hanging open, yet the communicators didn't hail the Enterprise. A few seconds
 later, when the guard asked about the communicators, the antenna grids were
 closed.  In addition, the Lieutenant Colonel who questioned Kirk was violating
 regulations by wearing his Wheel Hat indoors. The Berets on the guards, on the
 other hand, may have been ok. It seems to me that they are allowed indoors.
 Then, when they were just getting ready to beam Christopher back to his jet,
 he trotted down to the transporter console and hit the communicator switch. He
 sure learns fast, huh?

 The worst problem in this episode, of course, is toward the end. The entire
 scenario of returning Christopher to his aircraft by beaming him into his own
 body is not acceptable. It certainly is possible that Christopher was beamed
 back into the aircraft at the same instant that the earlier version of the
 Enterprse beamed him out. This could explain the visual effect. However next
 he indicated that the UFO had disappeared and that he was returning to base.
 The tractor SHOULD have remained on from the earlier Enterprise, and the
 Christopher who was returned to the plane should have gone down with the
 destryed aircraft--presumably bailing out and descending on parachute in such
 a way that the Enterprise sensors did not notice. Also, Christopher should
 have landed on the ground with the full memory of what had happened to him on
 the Enterprise, but hopefully he was ethical enough to not do anything with
 his kowledge that would change the future.

 One last thing: In the closing credits, Captain Christopher is listed as a
 Major.

 On the other hand, this episode, first broadcast in the U.S. on January 26,
 1967, correctly indicated that Apollo 11 would be launched on a Wednesday
 (July 16, 1969, 9:32 A.M., EDT.) Also, the Starfleet uniform given to Captain
 Christopher had Lieutenant's braid on the sleeve. Oddly enough, this was
 correct. An Air Force Captain is equivalent to a Navy Lieutenant, and
 Starfleet follows Navy rank.

 "@{"Court Martial" link "TG_ORIG/COURT_MARTIAL" 0}" - Kirk says "Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory
 sensor. It can, in effect, hear sounds. By installing a booster we can
 increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power." Hmmmm,
 either the writers or William Shatner seemed to think that it sound more
 impressive than just plain old "one". And, I guess we have to assume that both
 the voices and the other ship noises were masked out just like those
 heartbeats.  Also, at the end when Kirk is fighting Finney, Kirk's shirt
 is ripped at his right shoulder but his stunt double's shirt is obviously
 undamaged in that area.

 "@{"Return of the Archons" link "TG_ORIG/RETURN_OF_THE_ARCHONS" 0}" - When the landing party is hemmed in by Landru's
 legions at both ends of an alley, Kirk orders them to fire (on stun). McCoy's
 phaser appears not to fire at all. I suppose animation forgot to do the
 effect.  When Kirk's landing party starts running from the festival, a
 quick shot shows a rock BOUNCING off the head of one of the landing party
 members and up into the air. Now THAT'S a thick head!  When the landing
 party arrive at the hotel, it is daylight. Kirk talks a few minutes and then
 the landing party is escorted to their room. The owner opens a window and it
 is now pitch black outside. This planet might have a short day/night cycle,
 but their clock system seemed to be pretty close to that of the Earth's.

 "@{"Space Seed" link "TG_ORIG/SPACE_SEED" 0}" - As Kirk is bashing in Khan's glass coffin, his phaser falls
 off his belt. McCoy keeps looking down at it, like he's wondering when they're
 going to yell 'cut' so they can re-shoot the scene. They never did re-shoot
 because they didn't want to invest in more glass.  During the hearing at
 the end, when Kirk rings the ship's bell, watch McCoy closely. He has a
 strained, silly grin on his face, as if DeForest Kelley is desperately trying
 to keep from bursting out laughing. As Kirk finishes the last ring, McCoy
 sighs, as if in relief, and assumes a more appropriate expression.

 "@{"The City On The Edge Of Forever" link "TG_ORIG/CITY_ON_THE_EDGE_OF_FOREVER" 0}" - Clark Gable's first film was made in
 1930, at which time he was hardly a major star, and it would hardly have
 seemed strange that Kirk and ]cCoy might not have heard of him. "Good Night,
 Sweetheart" wasn't written until 1931. Also, Kirk mentions Orion's belt and
 points to it in the sky. Orion should not be visible in the night sky at that
 time of year (according to a calendar shown on a wall). Also, in the panning
 shot of the city where a bunch of brick buildings are shown, there is a
 radiation trident on a sign on a wall, which normally signifies a fallout
 shelter. Fallout shelters shouldn't exist for *years*.

 "@{"Amok Time" link "RG-ORIG/AMOK_TIME" 0}" - At the marriage ceremony, as Spock is going up to hit the
 gong, we get two shots of this happening. In the first shot, from the view of
 T'Pau, Spock starts moving toward the gong and then on the right we see
 T'Pring start moving to issue the Kah-if-farr. Then, there is a cut looking at
 the face of T'Pring, who in this scene is standing still. After a second,
 T'Pring starts to move forward to issue the challenge. Nothing too bad but I
 have to look at something. Yeah, that scene has several well-known continuity
 errors. The most graphis one is a long shot of the set during Kirk's talk with
 T'Pau, where we see Nimoy leaning against a wall when, continuity-wise, Spock
 is supposedly kneeling, deep in "plak tow." It's also easy to see stage lights
 in a couple of scenes.  Plus, when Spock goes to bang that gong, it rings
 before it's hit.  Also, T'Pau speaks to everyone else in
 Elizabethan/Shakespearean/King James English -- to a point of using "thee" and
 "thy". However, she never uses "thou", but, incorrectly uses thee. Spock even
 uses this incorrectly in one instance.

 "@{"Mirror, Mirror" link "TG_ORIG/MIRROR,_MIRROR" 0}" - In the beginning of the episode, Kirks calls up the
 Enterprise, requests beam up, and puts the communicator back on his belt.
 During the partial materialization on the transporter room, the communicator
 is in Kirk's hand with the antenna grid fully open. Then, when the landing
 party materializes fully in the mirror universe, the communicator is back on
 Kirk's belt.

 "@{"The Apple" link "TG_ORIG/THE_APPLE" 0}" - Near the end of the show, when the Big-E fails to break free of
 the tractor beam, Scotty falls against the captain's chair and one of the
 floorboards comes up off the floor.

 "@{"The Doomsday Machine" link "TG_ORIG/THE_DOOMSDAY_MACHINE" 0}" - There is at least one side shot of the device
 where the stars can be seen through the far side of the maw.  Also, Scotty
 loses his brogue for one line.  Also, while the Constellation is being
 flown into the doomsday machine, the model looks as if it was bumped.

 "@{"Obsession" link "G-ORIG/OBSESSION" 0}" - When Captain Kirk fights an ensign for the right to remain
 on the planet, Kirk tosses the ensign against a very solid rock. However, when
 that ensign is tossed against that same rock for a second time, that rock is
 not so solid and rolls slightly in the manner of a piece of plastic painted to
 look like a rock.

 "@{"A Piece of the Action" link "TG_ORIG/A_PIECE_OF_THE_ACTION" 0}" - When Kirk, Spock, and McCoy first beam down to
 the planet, a long shot shows the three of them approaching a bench. Kirk puts
 him hand on the bench and McCoy is behind him. A closer shot follows that
 shows McCoy standing behind the bench and then Kirk walks into the shot,
 behind McCoy, and then arrives at the bench.

 "@{"A Private Little War" link "TG_ORIG/A_PRIVATE_LITTLE_WAR" 0}" - In the closing credits, the Mugato is listed in
 the closing credits as Gumato. (Let's just call the whole thing off...)

 "@{"Patterns of Force" link "TG_ORIG/PATTERNS_OF_FORCE" 0}" - After Kirk and Spock enter the Zeon hideaway, Spock
 repairs a communicator which was disassembled by the Ekosians. As he tries to
 test it, he gives the wrist flip, but the antenna grid doesn't open. Spock
 glances down and opens it by hand.

 "@{"By Any Other Name" link "TG_ORIG/BY_ANY_OTHER_NAME" 0}" - In one scene Spock was talking with out moving his
 lips.  It occurs when Spock and the Kelvin Rojan are playing chess and they
 are discussing Rojan's response to Kirk kissing the Kelvin woman Kelinda.
 Initially we see the two characters playing chess and talking, but the view
 then switches to close ups of each person's face as they talk. When Spock says
 the line "Captain Kirk seems find her quite attractive" he looks as if he is
 thinking about something, but does not say anything. Must be telepathy. :-)


 "@{"The Omega Glory" link "TG_ORIG/THE_OMEGA_GLORY" 0}" - Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are seated and bound,
 speculating that the Yangs are Yankees and Cohms are Communists. When the
 camera is on the three of them, Kirk's hair is parted one way, yet, when there
 is a close-up shot of Kirk, his hair is parted another way>

 "@{"The Ultimate Computer" link "TG_ORIG/THE_ULTIMATE_COMPUTER" 0}" - Spock and Scotty are in the Jefferies tube and
 Kirk and the scientist are below looking at what they are doing. Kirk is
 restraining the scientist. From the top view, Kirk is holding him by his
 arm. The shot from the floor shows Kirk's arm around his head.

 "@{"Assignment: Earth" link "TG_ORIG/ASSIGNMENT_EARTH" 0}" - Kirk (in the briefing room) has Scotty on the
 tabletop viewscreen. Scotty (in Engineering) gives Kirk a report. Kirk ends
 the transmission with Kirk out and reaches to turn off the viewscreen but the
 viewscreen turns off before Kirk switches it off.

 "@{"The Paradise Syndrome" link "TG_ORIG/THE_PARADISE_SYNDROME" 0}" - The first time Kirk enters the temple he falls
 in through a (supposed) unseen trapdoor. However at the end when he manages
 to re-open the temple the entrance is clearly shown as a large raised sliding
 door, implying Kirk could not possibly have fallen in the first time.
 Also when Spock orders a full power phasor strike on the asteroid Scotty can
 be heard to say "Oh me bearings".

 "@{"And the Children Shall Lead" link "TG_ORIG/AND_THE_CHILDREN_SHALL_LEAD" 0}" - At the end of the episode Kirk gives the
 order 'Set course for Starbase 4', yet he mentions a little earlier that the
 security detail was still on the planet Triacus.

 "@{"Is There In Truth No Beauty" link "TG_ORIG/IS_THERE_IN_TRUTH_NO_BEAUTY" 0}?" - At the beginning of the episode, it is
 established that humans, even with the red visor, would go mad if they saw the
 ambassador being transported aboard. However, at the end of the episode, Kirk
 watches the ambassador being beamed out without the visor. Kirk should have
 gone mad at this point. [This could explain a lot about what happened during
 the third season...]

 "@{"Day Of The Dove" link "TG_ORIG/DAY_OF_THE_DOVE" 0}" - There is a prop that is grey, and looks like a grey
 hydrant coming out of the wall approximately 18 inches from the floor. During
 the big sword fight, we see them fighting by this "hydrant", cut to another
 scene, then cut back to see this "hydrant" knocked over.

 "@{"The Tholian Web" link "TG_ORIG/THE_THOLIAN_WEB" 0}" - When Chekov goes mad and screams, his mouth doesn't
 move.

 "@{"The Lights Of Zetar" link "TG_ORIG/THE_LIGHTS_OF_ZETAR" 0}" - Kirk has Romaine put into the pressure chamber in
 sick bay, and has the pressure increased by one atmosphere per second. At that
 rate, she would have been crushed like a bug in a minute.

 "@{"The Way to Eden" link "TG_ORIG/THE_WAY_TO_EDEN" 0}" - Although not an actual blooper, Adam's hand twitches
 after he was "dead". However, many muscular spasms do occur after death.
 Also, there is a short bit where the film is backwards, and Kirk's insignia
 appears on the wrong side of the shirt.

 "@{"The Cloud Minders" link "TG_ORIG/THE_CLOUD_MINDERS" 0}" - When Kirk and Spock are first captured by the
 miners, Kirk says something like, "What's the meaning of this?", but his mouth
 doesn't move.

 "@{"All Our Yesterdays" link "TG_ORIG/ALL_OUR_YESTERDAYS" 0}" - Spock claims that his planet is "millions of light
 years from here". This is unusual, since the galaxy is only 100,000 light
 years across.  There's also the comment from the policeman who says he
 heard Kirk speaking with spirits, and heard him call one of them "Bones". The
 only time that Kirk used the name "Bones", the policemen were away getting
 reinforcements.

 "@{"Turnabout Intruder" link "TG_ORIG/TURNABOUT_INTRUDER" 0}" - In this episode, "the death penalty has been
 forbidden. There's only one exception:  General Order 4." However, in "The
 Menagerie", "General Order 7" is the directive not to travel to Talos IV, and
 states, "The only death penalty left on the books."

 In "@{"Balance of Terror" link "TG_ORIG/BALANCE_OF_TERROR" 0}", Spock says that something called "cast
 rodinium" is the hardest substance known to Federation science, and yet, was
 pulverized by the Romulan weapon. Yet, in "@{"The Doomsday Machine" link "TG_ORIG/THE_DOOMSDAY_MACHINE" 0}", Spock says
 that there is no known way of blasting through solid neutronium. In "@{"Arena" link "TG_ORIG/ARENA" 0}",
 diamonds are "the hardest known substance", but in "Obsession", a rock
 substance is "twenty times as hard as diamonds.

NOTE: A (UV) means that I haven't verified the SNAFU, (V) means verified. 


Opening Credits (1st & 2nd Season) - During the opening sequence, the graphics
show a departure from the Sol system, beginning with Earth with the sun in the
background, and featuring fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn. During this sequence,
the camera pans right, and we see sunlight off the left side of Earth and
Jupiter, but the right side of Saturn, indicating that Saturn is backlit.  (UV)


Opening Credits (From Third Season On) - During the opening sequence, at the end
of the planets, watch closely the starfields.  The stars go in two completely
different directions.


    @{"Encounter_at_Farpoint" link "TG_TNG/ENCOUNTER_AT_FARPOINT 0" 0}
    The computer, giving Riker directions in order to meet Data on the
    holodeck, tells him the holodeck is the next door on
    the right. However, Riker turns left and walks into the holodeck. (V) 

    @{"The Naked Now" link "TG_TNG/The_Naked_Now" 0}
    When Troi finds Tasha in her quarters, affected by the intoxication
    disease and trying on Troi's scarves, she and Tasha hold hands as Tasha
    tries to grab a scarf from Troi.  The camera switches views between
    Troi and Tasha as they face each other.  When facing Troi, Troi is
    holding Tasha's right hand with her right hand.  When facing Tasha, she
    is holding Tasha's right hand with her left hand.  Also, in one of the
    views, they are holding a scarf, but not in the other.  The rights and
    lefts may be off, but there is definitely a screw-up in the scene.  (UV)

    @{"Code Of Honor" link "TG_TNG/CODE_OF_HONOR" 0}
    While on the planet, watch Deanna's arms.  In the group shots, Deanna's
    arms are at her sides, while, in the close-ups, her arms are behind her
    back.  (UV) During the fight with Yareena, Yar's weapon is on her left
    hand.However, when Yar beams up with Yareena, the weapon moves to her
    right hand.  I hate to think what else could be rearranged during
    transport!  (UV)

    @{"The Battle" link "TG_TNG/The_Battle" 0}
    The Ferengi Daimon raises the shields on the Stargazer, which should
    prevent transport, yet, right after raising shields, the Daimon beams
    off the Stargazer.

    @{"Hide and Q" link "TG_TNG/Hide_and_Q" 0}
    Shortly after Riker and the bridge crew are teleported to the planet by
    Q, Data's rank insignia are wrong.  He's suddenly a LtJG for about
    three minutes.  (UV)

    @{"Datalore" link "TG_TNG/Datalore" 0}
    Upon beaming down to the planet's surface, Commander Riker gives the
    stardate as 4124.5.  A little later, Captain Picard gives it as
    41242.45.  (V) Also, the glass of champagne Lore pours for Data goes flat
    immediately before Data picks it up thanks to the time that passed
    between the filming of the scenes.  You can see it during the traveling
    wipe.
    (UV) 

    @{"Skin Of Evil" link "TG_TNG/SKIN_OF_EVIL" 0}
    When Riker is being pulled into Armus, the away team runs towards
    Armus.  However Geordi drops his phaser into Armus.  When Captain
    Picard beams onto the planet, the away team is standing around calmly, and
    Geordi's phaser is back in his pocket.  (Either the phaser didn't get
    THAT dirty, or they beamed down another one quickly) (UV) Also, the
    computer-generated picture Worf is looking at within the first minutes
    of "Skin of Evil" is the very same one you can see twice later:  It
    contains already this graph of Armus' energy-level (or whatever it's
    meant to represent) with the same ups and downs Troi is causing much
    later in the show!

    @{"We'll Always Have Paris" link "TG_TNG/We'll_Always_Have_Paris" 0}
    The Eiffel Tower moves around in the Holodeck. (UV) 

    @{"Conspiracy" link "TG_TNG/CONSPIRACY" 0}
    At the beginning of the episode, while Picard is asleep, Riker tells
    LaForge to increase speed to Warp 6.  Laforge replies, "Aye Sir, full
    impulse."

    @{"Elementary, Dear Data" link "TG_TNG/ELEMENTARY,_DEAR_DATA" 0}
    Geordi asks, "What's wrong Data?" Data gives him the page.  Geordi
    says, "Data this is impossible," and he flips the paper over so that it
    faces the camera.  At this point we see the drawing right-side-up,
    which means that Geordi was looking at it upside down. (UV) 

    @{"Loud As A Whisper" link "TG_TNG/LOUD_AS_A_WHISPER" 0}
    Data has learned sign language and is now interpreting what the
    mediator is saying.  Data quotes the mediator as saying "My friends
    have died" or something like that, before it is even signed.  (V)

    @{"The Measure of a Man" link "TG_TNG/THE_MEASURE_OF_A_MAN" 0}
    In the first third we see the Enterprise _circle_ this *spinning*
    spacestation, but then, when Picard meets this woman the first time,
    they stay at the window and you can see the _moving_ Enterprise in
    front of *motionless* stars.  (UV)
    In this episode, Data is shown bending a metal bar.  However, the metal
    bar that Riker places on the JAG officer's desk is not bent in the same
    manner.  In addition, the speed at which the bari is bent should have
    produced plenty of heat. 

    @{"The Dauphin" link "TG_TNG/THE_DAUPHIN" 0}
    There is a scene where both of the aliens have changed into monsters.
    First the nanny changes to attack Wesley, then the girl changes.  There
    is a cut, and you see both monsters from a side view.  The girl-monster
    stands in front of a mirror, but you don't see a mirror image.  The
    monsters change back to the human forms and you still cannot see the
    mirror images.  At this time there is a cut again, but you see a
    similar view of the room and now you can see the mirror image of the
    girl in the mirror.  At the time they copied the monsters on the film,
    they didn't recognize that there was a mirror in that room. 

    @{"The Royale" link "TG_TNG/THE_ROYALE" 0}
    The surface temperature of the planet is less than absolute zero by six
    degrees Celsius.  Also, after they beam the piece of the ship out of
    orbit, O'Brien and Riker pick it up with their bare hands (coming from
    space, it should have been close to zero Kelvin itself).  Plus, after
    beaming down, they then scan the atmosphere to see if it's safe to
    breathe. (V) 

    @{"Q Who" link "TG_TNG/Q_WHO" 0}
    Q snaps with his fingers to send the Enterprise back to the starting
    point.  The ship then turns around to the left.  But look at the view
    of the stars on the screen:  they move from right to left.  This is the
    wrong direction.  (UV) Worf shoots Borg #1, who falls to the ground,
    his left arm sprawled over his head and his right leg bent in an
    awkward position.  The camera switches to wide-angle, and in that
    instant the dead Borg changes his position.  (UV)

    @{"Samaritan Snare" link "TG_TNG/SAMARITAN_SNARE" 0}
    Wesley opens a communications channel and says that Shuttle #2 is ready
    for takeoff.  However, in the following scene, when the shuttle is seen
    powering up, there is a "01" on the outside of the shuttle.  Oops. (UV)

    @{"Up The Long Ladder" link "TG_TNG/UP_THE_LONG_LADDER" 0}
    When Riker and his team are overpowered in the clone Prime Minister's
    office, Riker is rendered unconscious by a phaser set to stun.  As he
    is being dragged off-scene, you see him look up at the camera just as he
    thinks he is out of the shot. (UV) 

    @{"The Emissary" link "TG_TNG/THE_EMISSARY" 0}
    Data is playing poker at the start with the bridge crew.  The stakes
    are being raised as they go around the table.  Gerdie folds, Dr.
    Pulanski sees and raises by pushing a stack of coins onto the pot.
    Long shot:  small pot, no stacks.  Close up:  pot with 3 stacks of
    coins.  Number One sees and moves another stack into the pot.  Long
    shot:  original pot, no stacks of coins.  Worf wins with 3 aces.  Any
    gambler keeps an eye on the pot; seems the director of TNG doesn't.
    (UV) 

    @{"The Enemy" link "TG_TNG/THE_ENEMY" 0}
    Picard says to Tomaluk that he will be escorting the Romulan ship to
    the Neutral Zone.  Yet, in the closing shot, the Enterprise and the
    Romulan Ship take off in two different directions.  (V)

    @{"The Price" link "TG_TNG/THE_PRICE" 0}
    When the Ferengi Daimon talks to Picard about putting photon torpedoes
    through the worm hole, he says, "Casualties of war, Captain", however,
    his mouth looks as if he is saying "Picard." (V) Also, when Troi and
    someone is having dinner, at one point, one of them lifts up a fork and
    takes a bite, without anything on the fork.  Must be a tasty fork!
    (UV) 

    @{"The Hunted" link "TG_TNG/THE_HUNTED" 0}
    At the end when the prisoners show up, Danar tells the leader to shoot.
    Danar shoots the wall behind him and it blasts a hole in the wall.
    Later scenes show the wall to be undamaged.  (UV)

    @{"Yesterday's Enterprise" link "TG_TNG/YESTERDAY'S_ENTERPRISE" 0}
    At the end of the episode, Geordi talks with Guinan.  However, he is
    wearing an open neck uniform with black cuffs from the alternate
    timeline.  (V)

    @{"Sins of the Father" link "TG_TNG/SINS_OF_THE_FATHER" 0}
    The sound effects people must have fallen asleep every time someone got
    slapped.  (V)

    @{"Captain's Holiday" link "TG_TNG/CAPTAIN'S_HOLIDAY" 0}
    Picard is giving Vash the shovel with the handle pointing towards
    Picard.  Switch to a far shot and the handle is now pointing to Vash. 

    @{"Tin Man" link "TG_TNG/TIN_MAN" 0}
    The Enterprise and the Romulan ship are thrown far away by Tin Man.
    Wesley said that thev've been thrown "3.8 billion kilometers away".  A
    couple seconds later, the sun goes nova, and they all saw it on the
    viewscreen.  Unless the viewscreen is supposed to have some sort of
    sensor mechanism that relays events faster than the speed of light
    would bring the view in, they shouldn't have been able to view the star
    going nova for three and a half hours (assuming the US definition of
    "billion"):

       3.8E9 km * 1000 m/km
             3E8 m/s

    @{"The Most Toys" link "TG_TNG/THE_MOST_TOYS" 0}
    When Data is talking to the Enterprise at the start of the episode, he
    says, "Level 1 precautions for incoming material remain in effect." But
    when Geordi and Wesley are playing back the tapes later, we hear, "Level 1
    precautions remain in effect." Selective recorder? (UV) 

    @{"Sarek" link "TG_TNG/SAREK" 0}
    The music recital in this episode contained several errors.  First, the
    quartet seating is towards the audience, not toward each other.
    Classical music was originally developed with the performers facing each
    other in order to get visual cues.  Performing in front of the audience
    did not come about until much later.  Second, the Allegro is by
    Brahm's, not Mozart.  Third, the Allegro is a sextet, not a quartet.
    (UV) Also, in this story, Geordi and Wesley are setting up this pool,
    and Wesley says that the temperature is 150 degrees celsius, which is
    302 degrees Farenheit.  However, there was no obvious radiant heat
    because Geordi and Wesley stand close to the pool and peer inside.
    (UV)

    @{"Best of Both Worlds, Part II" link "TG_TNG/The_Best_of_Both_Worlds_Pt.2" 0}
    As the Borg Ship is shown warping towards the Saturn, the lighting on
    the planet is from the right, and the Borg ship arrives on the screen
    from the right, which would indicate that the ship is coming from the same
    direction as the sun...
    kind of a round-about way to get to the Earth, eh? (UV) 

    @{"Family" link "TG_TNG/FAMILY" 0}
    Jack Crusher is shown (not wearing a communicator pin), then they show
    him again and a comm badge has magically appeared.  (UV) At the end of
    the episode, there is a scene of Picard's young nephew, Rene, sitting
    under a tree and gazing up at the stars (presumably imagining following
    in his uncle's footsteps).  Appearing clearly in the middle of the sky
    is the constellation Orion.  But while the episode appears to be set in
    the summer months, Orion is only visible in the early evenings in the
    dead of winter.  Either the 24th century terraforming teams have
    conveniently rearranged Earth's seasons (after all, they _did_ make
    France look a lot like the Sonoma Valley), or the post-production
    people goofed up.

    @{"Brothers" link "TG_TNG/BROTHERS" 0}
    The code which Data gives to lock the Enterprise computer system
    differs between the spoken version and the version displayed on the
    screen.  (See "Security Codes") (V)

    @{"Suddenly Human" link "TG_TNG/SUDDENLY_HUMAN" 0}
    When Jeramiah (?) sits down in 10 forward to have a banana split, he is
    on Wesley's left.  Then when Wesley get hit by the ice cream, it comes
    from Wesley's right.  (UV) Near the end when Picard brings Jeramiah (?)
    onto the bridge, we don't hear the sound effect of the turbolift doors
    opening.  (UV)

    @{"Remember Me" link "TG_TNG/REMEMBER_ME" 0}
    Beverly asks the computer to show her "the Universe".  The computer
    then puts out a drawing of the Enterprise that is cropped with a sphere
    with the portion of the saucer section with the bridge cropped off.  (UV)
    In the final act, when Wesley and the Traveler are entering the
    equations into the computer, watch Wesley's hand.  He closes his eyes, and
    then places his hand on the case, about three inches below the entry
    pad.  While he is making his entries, his hand starts moving up, while
    the sound effects people keep making the sounds in time.  (V) Dr.
    Crusher enters the turbo lift, in the last act, and ask to go to
    Engineering.  The computer refuses and she says to go anywhere on Deck
    36, and the turbolift then goes.  The lights of the turbo lift then go
    down, indicating the lift went up from the bridge.  (UV).  When
    everyone has disappeared and Bev comes off the turbolift and down onto
    the bridge, the cameraman/equipment can be seen in the reflective
    glass/mirror to the left of the lift.  (UV)

    @{"Legacy" link "TG_TNG/LEGACY" 0}
    During the card trick with Data, Riker's hand keeps on changing
    position during the trick when the camera switches.
    (UV) 

    @{"Reunion" link "TG_TNG/REUNION" 0}
    After K'Eyhlar dies, Alexander runs away.  Worf lets out his primal
    scream.  Then, we see her body being lowered to the floor.  As she is
    finally settled, her eyes flutter open and closed several times (as,
    presumably, the actress, Suzie Plakson, "gets her bearings").  Also
    notice that her head is facing towards her left.  However, when her
    body is shown full-on from the perspective of her feet (as Worf tells
    Alexander to "look at death, and never forget"), her head is facing
    slightly towards her *RIGHT*, and remains that way for the rest of the
    scene (a prime example of a scene being shot in several takes with the
    continuity person being asleep on the job).  (V) Also, Dr.  Crusher and
    her aide come from the bedroom, not from the corridor.  Maybe they
    killed her...  (UV) When Worf kills Duras near the end of the
    episode the camera shows Duras's dead body and red blood coming from
    it.  This is in conflict with Star Trek VI where the Klingons had pink
    blood.  (UV).

    @{"Devil's Due" link "TG_TNG/DEVIL'S_DUE" 0}
    In the TOS episode "Day of the Dove", Captain Kang explicitly remarks
    that the Klingons have no devil.  However, in "Devil's Due", Ardra uses
    the guise of the Klingon devil, Fekhlar, a creature that consumes the
    souls of cowards.  (V)

    @{"Clues" link "TG_TNG/CLUES" 0}
    Guinan has a cigarette in a holder, which changes length with each
    camera cut...a common problem in any movie where smoking is portrayed. 

    @{"Night Terrors" link "TG_TNG/NIGHT_TERRORS" 0}
    Check out the Brittain's visual log when the captain is going mad, the
    name of the ship in the log is the USS Brattain, even though the saucer
    decal reads USS Brittain.  (UV)

    @{"The Nth Degree" link "TG_TNG/THE_NTH_DEGREE" 0}
    In the holodeck scene where Troi attempts to talk Barclay out of the
    neural net device he has concocted, the holodeck doors don't close
    properly.  A section of light is visible for a minute or more at about
    waist level.

    @{"Qpid" link "TG_TNG/QPID" 0}
    Vash is writing this letter to Riker, then she folds it like this:

                   ------------------------


    So that the text is covered completely with the first fold.  Then she
    places the next fold over the first:


                   ------------------------
                   |                      |

                   ------------------------


    Then, when Q enters and finds the letter, he just opens the second
    fold, but he is holding the letter *upside down*!  He starts reading
    even though the words are not visible to him, because the first fold is
    still closed.  And he knows that the letter is for Riker.  Sure, Q
    knows everything, but why did he have top open it at ALL then?  :-) (UV)

    @{"The Drumhead" link "TG_TNG/THE_DRUMHEAD" 0}
    After the first hearing with J'Ddan, Worf and J'Ddan leave the hearing
    room.  The doors open, as they are walking though the doorway, the
    doors start to close, but hesitate, open back up and then close after
    they leave the doorway.  Looks like someone pulled on the rope too soon
    :-) (V) Also, Satie says that Captain Picard took command of the
    Enterprise at Stardate 41162.  This is in error...it was 41152.  (V)

    In the teaser, Data finishes telling Jenna the reasons why she broke up
    with Jeff.  She and Data then close up the photon torpedo, and she
    moves off to a control panel.  On top of the torpedo rests a black,
    hand-sized deviceamajig.  Data stands up, holding some sensormajig in
    his left hand.  The scene then shifts to Data walking towards Jenna,
    and the sensormajig is now in his RIGHT hand (with no indication that
    he ever shifted it there), and Jenna is holding the deviceamajig she
    left on top of the torpedo (with no indication that she ever went back
    to get it).  (V)

    @{"Redemption II" link "TG_TNG/Redemption_Pt.2" 0}
    In part one of this story, Worf said that he would be serving on the
    Bortas.  Yet, in this episode, he is serving on the Hectar, with no
    explanation about the transfer.  Also, Picard says to Guinan that Yar
    died a year prior to Guinan joining the crew.  However, "Skin of Evil"
    was the fourth to last story of the season, and Guinan is first seen in
    the second season premiere "The Child", suggesting only 3-4 months
    between the two stories.  Picard refers to the battle on Narendra III
    as taking place 24 years ago to Sela, and 23 years ago to Guinan.  (V)
    But, of course, Guinan senses time differently...  When Worf is given
    his family name back the blood on the knife is red not pink as in Star
    Trek VI.  (UV)

    @{"Darmok" link "TG_TNG/DARMOK" 0}
    The very last shot (from outside the ship) shows Picard looking out the
    windows of his ready room.  You can see a reflection in the window of
    the stars moving.  However, they are moving straight toward the window.
    The ready room on the port side of the ship.  The stars should have
    been moving left to right (from our reflected view).  (UV)

    @{"Ensign Ro" link "TG_TNG/ENSIGN_RO" 0}
    When Ensign Ro takes off her jacket, her communicator is on her jacket.
    However, when she hands the jacket to the little girl, her communicator
    jumps to her uniform, with no action of putting the communicator there.
    (V) Then, when Ro talks with the girl, we sometimes se shots taken from
    behind the girl, sometimes from behind Ro.  On the shots taken
    from behind the girl, Ro is less crouched, I mean that her head is much
    higher compared to when she is filmed from behind her.

    @{"Silicon Avatar" link "TG_TNG/SILICON_AVATAR" 0}
    In the second act, look closely at the tricorder that Dr.  Marr holds
    during the conversation between Dr.  Marr and Data.  During the
    conversation, she has her tricorder open.  She then closes it, then
    reopens it, but holds the tricorder UPSIDE DOWN!!!!  (V)

    @{"Disaster" link "TG_TNG/DISASTER" 0}
    In the scene where Dr.  Crusher and Geordi are evacuating all the air
    out of the cargo bay, Geordi hits the button that closes the cargo bay.
    The pushing of the button and resulting door closing are audible, even
    though sound doesn't travel in a vacuum.  (Probably dramatic reasons)
    Also, when the ship starts shaking, they cut to Ten Forward, where
    the stars are shaking right along with the ship.  (V) Also, while in
    the turbo lift, when Picard gives out the pips to the girl (whose name
    escapes me), look closely (actully it's fairly obvious once you notice
    it).  Her collar has two small holes where the pips go, before the pips
    were put on.  Either they punched some holes to make it easier to put
    them on (since the collar looks fairly stiff) or it's a product of
    having to do the shot in several takes.  (UV) In the last scene,
    Picard is leaving the bridge heading for his ready room, the door
    closes too early, and the sound comes too late.  (UV)

    @{"The Game" link "TG_TNG/THE_GAME" 0}
    When the crew are forcing Wesley to play the game, and Riker is holding

    @{"Unification I" link "TG_TNG/UNIFICATION" 0}
    When Dr.  Crusher is examining Data in order to prep him (and Picard)
    for Romulus, she asks if Data's ears are detachable, to which Data says
    that they are not.  Yet, in "Datalore", Data's brother, Lore, is
    clearly shown without ears. A design change? 

    @{"Unification II" link "TG_TNG/Unification_II" 0}
    After Spock, Picard, and Data have knocked out the Romulan guards, and
    Spock has Sela at gunpoint, Picard has no gun in his hand.  After a
    camera switch, Picard then holds a Romulan "disrupter pistol".  A
    minute later, after a scene with the Enterprise, Picard is still
    standing in the same place, but with a Romulan "disrupter rifle".  (UV)
    After Data gives Sela the famous "Spock Pinch", and when Picard, Data,
    and Spock leave the room, look at the glass pyramid in Sela's office.
    There is a reflection of a cameraman chewing gum.  (V)

    @{"New Ground" link "TG_TNG/NEW_GROUND" 0}
    Alexander states that he was born on stardate 42305.  Unless the
    equivalent of 01000 stardate equals approximately one year, Alexander
    would be only 2 and a half years old.  Also, the creature which Riker
    saves from the lab is obviously a hand puppet. (V)

    Troi and Tarmin get into the turbolift on Deck 3.  Troi orders it to go

    Geordi states that his VISOR covered the range from 1 Hertz to 1

    While a record search is performed, Deanna's father was listed as
    "Alex".  However, in "The Child", she named her child after Ian, her
    father's name.  (V) When MacDuff is talking to Picard in Picard's ready
    room, when Picard goes to the window, all you see in the window is the
    reflection of Picard and the room behind him (not the stars outside),
    then, when you see MacDuff, in the reflection, leaving the room behind
    Picard, when the door opens, you don't see the reflection of the
    bridge, you see stars.  Oops!  (UV) After Riker's first love scene, a
    wide-angle-view-pan-to-closeup on the bridge can be seen at the very
    top of the screen, in the brightly lit area.  (UV).  Shortly
    afterwards, in the same scene, MacDuff is walking around and up to the
    tactical station from his chair, and we can see his legs walk next to
    Worf's.  The camera cuts to Worf, and we see MacDuff approaching Worf. (UV)
    Also, Beverly Crusher is listed in the crew manifest as a Lt.  Cmdr,
    when her actual rank is Commander.  (UV)

    @{"Ethics" link "TG_TNG/ETHICS" 0}

    @{"Cause and Effect" link "TG_TNG/CAUSE_AND_EFFECT" 0}
    The first time we see Picard in the Sickbay talking to Geordi and Dr.
    Crusher, he is wearing his standard uniform, and states he had a
    feeling of deja vu when he was reading.  However, in the next loop, he
    is shown wearing his grey uniform while reading in his ready room, and
    when he's in Sickbay, he's also wearing his maroon jacket.  (Also
    recall that in the first loop, when he is talking to Beverly, he is
    wearing the grey uniform.  Thus, the sequence goes:  grey ->
    standard -> grey).  Presumably, both instances of this scene happen at
    the same "time", and since Picard's behaviour was not affected until
    Dr.  Crusher contacted him, why is he wearing the standard uniform in
    one loop, and the grey uniform in the next loop? (V) 

    @{"The First Duty" link "TG_TNG/THE_FIRST_DUTY" 0}
    About 10 minutes in -- Wes goes to the door.  The long shot has him
    opening the door with his *left hand*.  Cut to close up, and the door
    is being opened with his *right hand*.  (UV) Also, about 40 minutes in.
    Wes is talking to [someone] in his quarters.  From behind, his hands
    are in one position, and when we cut to the front, they're in another
    position, obviously different. (UV) 

    @{"Cost of Living" link "TG_TNG/COST_OF_LIVING" 0}
    In the turbolift where Picard and Data got trapped, due to the metal
    parasites, look closely:  Picard, in this scene only, is wearing only
    three pips.  (V) Also, Picard is told that the inertial dampers had
    failed, after which he orders the Enterprise out of warp.  If the
    inertial dampers had failed, they would have been splattered all over
    the bridge.  (V) Also, when Lwaxana and Alexander are in the mudbath,
    Alexander is holding an edible glass with a bite in it.  One
    shot shows the bite pointing to the right and another shot shows it
    pointing to Alexander's left.  (UV)

    @{"Imaginary Friend" link "TG_TNG/IMAGINARY_FRIEND" 0}
    Data says something about a lower strand density to the starboard side,

    @{"The Next Phase" link "TG_TNG/THE_NEXT_PHASE" 0}
    One of things overlooked is an explanation of why Geordi and Ro are
    able to breathe or not be able to go through the floors.  Oops.  There
    is even a scene where Geordi's hand goes through a table, but another
    where a phased Romulan can sit in a chair that rocks when he gets up.
    (UV) When the Romulan is fighting with Ro, and LaForge shoves him
    through the bulkhead, we see the Romulan exit the Enterprise facing us
    right-side up, but when they show him drifting away into the icy cold
    of space, he is facing *away* from us right-side up -- he's facing the
    wrong way as he's rotating!  (UV) Also, Riker starts playing the
    trombone before his lips reach the mouthpiece.  (UV)

    @{"Time's Arrow" link "TG_TNG/TIME'S_ARROW" 0}
    The paper that Data picks up is dated "Sunday, August 11, 1893".
    Unfortunately, August 11, 1893 was a Friday.  (V) Also, during the
    episode "Clues", Guinan says she was late because she had trouble
    getting into her dress, yet, in this episode, she is seen wearing a
    dress.  (V)

    @{"Realm of Fear" link "TG_TNG/REALM_OF_FEAR" 0}
    After 4 seasons, lt O'Brien has suddenly lost his normal two pips,
    replaced by a single hollow pip.  Other pip-problems include lt
    Barclay's single/hollow pips swapping position, as well as having two
    solid pips when in Troi's office.  They probably felt that Barclay
    needed to outrank O'Brien to be able to influence him.

    @{"Man Of The People" link "TG_TNG/MAN_OF_THE_PEOPLE" 0}
    There were several snafus that occurred, including: 
     - In Engineering, when Geordi and Beverly were checking out the
       Biofilter logs from the Dorian, Geordi had two hollow pips and one
       solid, instead of two solid and one hollow.
     - When Riker and Troi walked out of Ten-Forward (the scene where Troi
       was wearing that revealing dress), they stepped right into a
       Turbolift.  The sign on the lift's door said "08 Turbolift",
       indicating they were on Deck 8 instead of Deck 10. 
     - Near the end, in Sickbay, when Beverly was reviving Deanna, Deanna's
       eyes fluttered open a couple of times, and then remained shut.
       (This is when she still looked old.) Although I couldn't make out an
       actual color, it was obvious that Marina didn't have her black
       contacts in.
     - Picard referred to transporter room 3 *twice* at the crucial time of
       beaming out the ambassador's aide?  He told room 2 to be ready.
       Transporter room 2 was referred to throughout the episode.  This is
       a relatively trivial point, but a stupid production error none the
       less.  (UV)
     - Also, isn't it amazing how dead hair folicles can change color from
       grey to brown when Troi de-ages, isn't it?

    @{"Schisms" link "TG_TNG/SCHISMS" 0}
    When Riker sits down at Conn when the ensign is having trouble
    navigating, when we see his hands over the console, it is the display
    for Ops.  It was also explained at the end of the episode that the
    experimenters had homed in on the Enterprise from Geordi modifying the
    sensors.  Yet, Riker began experiencing his chronic insomnia days
    before Geordi made his modifications.  (UV) Also, Worf notes that Lt.
    Haggerl had just returned to Deck 9, Section 17, yet, seconds
    later, Dr. Crusher wants a device brought to Deck 9, Section 19. (V) 

    @{"Rascals" link "TG_TNG/RASCALS" 0}
    The computer display in the classroom clearly shows "Classroom Seven"
    on the screen.  Yet, when Picard meets Riker, he refers to Classroom
    Eight.  (V) Also, when Keiko gets the coffee, when she picks it up from
    the replicator, it's in her left hand, yet, in the next scene, it's in
    her right hand.  (V) Also, amazingly, the clothing shrank, but not
    proportionally, and Guinan's hat and Ro's headband are perfect.  (V)
    When Riker dives to avoid a phaser blast, we *HEAR* the phaser, but do
    not see it.

    @{"A Fistful Of Datas" link "TG_TNG/A_FISTFULL_OF_DATAS" 0}
    When Data is being connected to the computer, look at his neck.  You
    can see where the gold makeup ended.  (UV)
    Also, when Pa Hollinder talks to the young Hollinder, and Pa turns, his
    hand gets "cut off" due to the video wipe.  (V)
    Also, while Pa talk with Worf and Troi, take a look at the manniquin
    stand-in for Young Hollinder.

    @{"Chain Of Command" link "TG_TNG/CHAIN_OF_COMMAND" 0}
    The tunnels were underground, yet, they never once used a flashlight, and
    there was light down there.  (UV) Also, when Worf opens up the door
    that was magnetically sealed, it opened inward like a normal door, yet,
    when they started to run out, the door slid closed. Trick door? 

    @{"Ship In A Bottle" link "TG_TNG/SHIP_IN_A_BOTTLE" 0}
    When the book is tossed out of the holodeck, it got zapped immediately.
    This conflicts with "The Big Goodbye", in which the gangsters, when
    they walked out of the holodeck, they de-rezzed slowly.  Also, in
    "Elementary, Dear Data", there was a sheet of paper which did not
    de-rez when Picard took it out of the holodeck.  Moriarty must have
    made some programming boo-boos.  (V) Also, when Picard walks into the
    holodeck he is wearing his open coat with the blue shirt, but he walks
    out wearing his one-piece red shirt.  Either he changed his uniform
    inside the holo-deck and is wearing a holo-shirt (in which case his
    uniform top should have disappeared when he steps out of the holo-deck
    at the end of the episode) or they screwed up again!  :-) (UV) Also,
    when they cut to a commercial break at the end of the scene where
    Moriarty tells Picard he has taken over the ship, Picard begins to say
    something as the screen fades.  It's close to the end of the first half
    of the episode.  (UV) Finally, it appears that the command "Computer,
    Freeze Program" doesn't stop flames in a fireplace from flickering, or
    a clock from ticking....

    @{"Face Of The Enemy" link "TG_TNG/FACE_OF_THE_ENEMY" 0}
    When the defector ensign boards the Enterprise, he asks Riker to meet
    with *CAPTAIN* Picard.  When Picard walks to that ensigns quarters, the
    defector addresses him as *COMMANDER* as if Picard were a Romulan CO.
    (UV) Also, Troi is surgically altered to look like a Romulan, including
    the short hair style.  When Crusher alters her back, she has long hair
    again.  So Crusher can accelerate hair growth, the Romulan captor hid
    her hair, Troi wears a wig, or they messed up *another* scene! 

    @{"Birthright, Part I" link "TG_TNG/Birthright_Pt.1" 0}
    When Data first started painting, you could hear his furious little
    brushstrokes against the canvas (whish whish whish!).  But when he
    stopped painting and stepped back to view his work, you could *still*
    hear the brushstrokes (whish whish whish)! (UV) 

    @{"Birthright, Part II" link "TG_TNG/Birthright_Pt.2" 0}
    Worf states that Kayhless caused the oceans to overflow with his tears.
    Slight problem:  In Star Trek VI, Spock states that Klingons have no
    tear ducts.

    @{"Rightful Heir" link "TG_TNG/RIGHTFUL_HEIR" 0}
    It is stated that there has not been a Klingon Emperor for over 300

    Worf's father was loyal to the Emperor.

    @{"Second Chances" link "TG_TNG/SECOND_CHANCES" 0}
    Near the end of the episode Cdr Riker is rescuing Lt Riker on the edge
    of the cliff.  In one of the long shots, the stunt double dressed as Lt
    Riker was wearing a DS9 gold and black uniform tunic, not a TNG tunic.
    When Lt Riker then gets his next close-up, he's back in a TNG gold
    tunic.  Somebody in the costuming department wasn't careful that day.
    If it was one of the early TNG uniforms, though, it could have been
    bunched up around his shoulders (they tend to do that when your arms
   are raised), so what the viewer sees is the black undershirt.  (UV)

    @{"Timescape" link "TG_TNG/TIMESCAPE" 0}
    As Troi enters sickbay for the first time, she scoots past two security
    officers in mid-stride just before they enter sickbay.  Later, as she
    yanks Beverly out of the way and draw on the Romulan, no security guards
    enter the room (even though they were scant feet from entering and in
    the middle of a stride).  (UV) When Data, Troi and Picard returned to
    the Enterprise and set time in motion again, Picard was on the bridge.
    When time started forward again, Picard told Riker that he'd find
    Geordi on the Romulan ship and to beam him directly to sickbay.  The
    Romulan ship is no longer around.  (UV) The runabout crew had just
    suffered a port engine shutdown, due to the effect of the time
    discontinuity bubbles.  Picard tells Data that he is going to check the
    fuel consumption logs and proceeds to go to another part of the craft.
    We see a plate of aged fruit as Picard walks in.  Notice his right hand
    as he enters.  His fingers are curled inward, shielding his nails from
    our view.  When he sits down at the control panel, he begins to touch
    the controls with the pads of his fingers.  His extra long nails are
    already clearly visible, moments before he ever reached for the fruit.

    @{"Liasons" link "TG_TNG/LIASONS" 0}
    In the poker scene, when the Ambassador "stole" some of Worf's chips,

    In the cemetery, Beverly asks Deanna to go with her to the house.
    Deanna agrees and they walk out of the cemetery.  Then Picard begins a
    discussion with the Governor of the colony.  Towards the end of the
    discussion, when the Governor is explaining about visiting the castle,
    Deanna walks across the cemetery in the background.  (She left with
    Beverly.) The next scene shows Beverly and Deanna entering the house. (V) 


- Betazoid's and the Ferengi Mind:  In @{"The Battle" link "TG_TNG/THE_BATTLE" 0} and @{"The Price" link "TG_TNG/THE_PRICE" 0}, Deanna's is
able to sense deception from the Ferengi, and later, used against them.  Yet, in
"Menage A Troi", the Betazoid Ambassador says that they are unable to read
Ferengi minds, a fact later confirmed in "The Loss".  Data has suggested that
this is due to the Ferengi brain separated in four regions.  It should also be
noted that Portal was unable to read the Ferengi mind in "The Last Outpost"
because the Ferengi mind is somehow shielded.


- In @{"Reunion" link "TG_TNG/REUNION" 0} Gowron was prepared to offer K'Ehleyr a seat on the Klingon Council
for her assistance in getting Picard to quicken the pace of the Rite of
Succession.  However, in @{"Redemption" link "TG_TNG/REDEMPTION_PT.1" 0}, he states to Picard that females are not

@node "Scotty's_Finger" "Scotty's Missing Finger"

                          @{b}@{i}SCOTTY'S MISSING FINGER @{ub}@{ui}

 James Doohan is missing the middle finger of his right hand. During World
 War II, he served in the Royal Canadian Artillery (not the air force, although
 he flew - like a maniac - often) for six years and two months and lead the
 fifth Landing Craft Assault. He was on the ground when his middle finger
 caught three bullets; the head wound and other wounds did no damage. He then
 became a flight instructor before leaving the military in October of 1945.

 If you look at his hand, you'll see a faint red streak, indicating the
 entire metacarpal bone was surgically removed. Usually, if Scotty's hands were
 called for in a script to operate the transporter, we cut to a shot of someone
 else's hands. Usually, we'll see Scotty's hands behind some object or side on.
 However, here are some scenes where the missing finger is visible:

 "@{"The Apple" link "TG_ORIG/THE_APPLE" 0}" - Scotty's clenched fist.

 "@{"The Trouble With Tribbles" link "TG_ORIG/THE_TROUBLE_WITH_TRIBBLES" 0} - After Kirk notices what he got for his
 chicken sandwich and coffee, Scotty walks in carrying a whole bundle of
 tribbles. The missing finger is clearly noticeable.

 "Star Trek IV" - When McCoy hands Scotty the mouse in Dr. Nichols' office,
 Scotty lack of digitude is noticeable for a second.

 "Star Trek V" - When Uhura tosses Scotty the bag of food, the missing finger
 is noticeable.

 TNG "@{"Relics" link "TG_TNG/RELICS" 0}" - Scotty's missing finger can be noticed a few times, notably in
 Ten-Forward and on the original Enterprise in the Holodeck.

 From "The Making of Star Trek" by Stephen E. Whitfield & Gene Roddenberry



                                  Beyond
                           The rim of star-light
                                  My love
                        Is wand'ring in star flight
                                  I know
                   He'll find in star-clustered reaches
                                   Love,
                     Strange love a star woman teaches
                                  I know
                           His journey end never
                               His star trek
                            Will go on forever.
                               But tell him
                      While he wanders his starry sea
                          Remember, remember me.
