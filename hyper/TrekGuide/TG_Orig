   Catalyzed by an energy field in space, the ESP powers latent in both Gary

   A robot space ship blocks the path of the Enterprise and then attacks. Kirk
 retaliates and destroys the mechanism. A manned vessel then appears, and the
 voice of a ghostly monster, Balok, declares that the Enterprise will have to
 be destroyed in counter-retaliation. Kirk tries a bluff; he tells the alien
 that corbomite in the hull of the Enterprise, if fired upon, would explode
 and destroy both ships. With a superior tractor beam, the alien ship takes
 the Enterprise in tow. . .and the battle of wits continues, until Kirk 
 ascertains that the other ship has only one inhabitant.

   Anyone over the age of puberty on this earthlike planet fall victim to a
 fatal, leprous disease; but the children age so slowly that they don't know
 why there are no longer any grown-ups ("grups") and why occasionally their
 older members contract the disease and die. They take perpetual childhood
 for granted. The Enterprise officers land and contract the disease--and must
 find corrective and immunization measure but the kids distrust them and

  Kirk's career is at stake when he is put on trial for obstruction of 
 justice and culpable negligence, accused of killing a crew member during 
 the panic of an ion storm. The ships computer no only has a record of events
 that prove Kirk's guilt, but can reproduce TV pictures that support the
 record. Kirk's prosecutor is an old flame he fondly remembers; his defender
 is a shrewd cantankerous old coot known for taking hopeless cases.

  In the original Star Trek's only two part story, Spock contrives to
 take over the Enterprise and set her course toward Talos IV, a planet 
 off limits to the Federation, He kidnaps Kirk's predecessor, Captian 
 Pike, and while not relinquishing control of the ship, he turns himself 
 in for court martial and a sure death penalty. Pike is a victim of
 radiation poisoning, and while mentally alert, is physically no more
 than a vegetable. Spock attempts to explain his actions by showing
 visual records of Pike's last visit to Talos IV, where Pike had been
 captured, placed in a zoo, and invited to mate with first one Earth
 woman then another. Part of his tortures consisted of masterful illusions 
 that made him see one woman as many different women (This story is

  After a puzzling moment when the starts simply wink out, the Enterprise
 crew discover a single life form on a planet below; his name is Lazarus.
 Soon, it is discovered there are two virtually identical Lazaruses, but
 never are they seen together. One is insane and dangerous, the other
 rational and in pursuit of his mad alter-ego. They are from parallel
 universes, one positive, the other negative; and if the two men should
 ever meet, both universes, ours and the other would be obliterated. 
 Which is what the mad one hopes to do but which one is mad and which
 one is insane?

  Due to an accidental time-warp, the Enterprise becomes a 20th Century UFO.
 They observe a fighter plane tracking them, note that the plane is in danger
 of exploding, and rescue the pilot by beaming him aboard. Dilemma: they can't
 return the pilot to Earth, for his story, if put on record, might change
 history; and they can't keep the pilot with them, because, according to 
 history, he must have a son who will be a key figure in the development
 of space travel.

  The inhabitants of Eminar II and those of Vendikar have found no solution
 to perpetual warfare, so, centuries ago, they devised a cold-blooded quasi-
 solution: instead of the chaotic destruction of real war, they rely upon
 computers to select likely targets. If the computer says a certain building
 "would" be hit, the "victims" obligingly disintegrate the citizens inside.
 This time, the computers found an unsuspecting target: the Federation ship
 in orbit above them, the Enterprise.

 history of space exploration, including the construction of the Enterprise,
 will not have occurred. Kirk and Spock go back into the 1930's to a store-
 front mission during the Depression and wait for McCoy to arrive. Meanwhile
 Kirk falls very much in love with the very woman who holds the key to 
 the two possible futures and who must be prevented from meeting McCoy.

  Gelatinous parasites have invaded the outpost of Deneva; they inhabit human 
 bodies and drive the hosts mad from pain, then produce death. Kirk's brothers
 family is there; only the child, Peter, survives. In attempting to assist,
 Spock becomes infected, but because of his mental control is able to
 withstand the pain and help McCoy look for some way to kill the parasite
 without killing the host.
