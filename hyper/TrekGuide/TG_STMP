                                   1982
 
  The second STAR TREK movie opens with a new generation of Starfleet
 cadets being trained by Lt.  Saavik, a brilliant young cadet of Vulcan
 descent who hopes to pass the Kobayashi Maru simulation excerise, an
 important part of Academy training and serve aboard a Federation starship.
 Now an Admiral, James T.  Kirk, is unhappy with his current ground
 assignment and broods over memories of times past while his friends Spock
 and Dr.  McCoy urge him to look ahead toward a new command.
 
  The USS Reliant, under the command of Captain Clark Terrell and
 First Officer Pavel Chekov, is on a survey mission in the Ceti Alpha system
 in search of a suitable planet on which to test a device known as Genesis,
 an invention designed to be able to transform lifeless planets into
 fruitful, life-sustaining environments.
 
  Beaming down, they are surprised to discover Kirk's old nemesis
 Khan Noonian Singh, a genetically engineered super-soldier from the late
 20th Century and his followers, whom Kirk had exiled 15 years earlier.  His
 world has since been laid to waste by severe gravitational shifts caused by
 the destruction of a neighboring planet and many of his people, including
 his wife.  Khan has vowed revenge against Kirk and, after taking over the
 wills of Terrell and Chekov through the use of mind-controlling Ceti Eels,
 Khan and his people hijack the Reliant and set off in search of Kirk.
 
  Aboard the Enterprise, Kirk receives a garbled message from Dr.
 Carol Marcus, chief scientist of the project and an old flame, complaining
 of interference by Starfleet with her work.  Sensing that she and her
 project are threatened, Kirk takes command and changes course toward Regula
 One, where Genesis is based.
 
  While en route, Kirk encounters Khan, who unleashes a surprise
 barrage of phaser fire, nearly destroying the Enterprise.  By tapping into
 Reliant's security access code, Kirk is able to lower Khan's shields and
 damages his ship in turn.
 
  Enterprise reaches Regula One to find the station ravaged, the
 material of Genesis gone and Terrell and Chekov left behind.  Finding the
 transporter set for an area deep within a nearby asteroid.  Kirk, McCoy and
 Saavik beam down only to be ambushed by David Marcus who believes Kirk to
 be responsible for the attack on the space station.  Kirk recognizes David
 to be his son, but before he can explain the truth, Terrell and Chekov,
 still under the influence of the Ceti Eels placed by Khan draw their
 phasers on Kirk and his party.  Unable to bring himself to kill Kirk,
 Terrell turns his phaser on himself instead.  Chekov's Eel is destroyed,
 leaving him unconscious, but intact.
 
  Khan, enraged that his latest bid to kill Kirk has failed,
 transports away the Genesis Torpedo and leaves the landing party behind.
 While Kirk and his team await rescue from the Enterprise, he is awed by the
 remarkable results of the Genesis experiments.  He also explains to Lt.
 Saavik how he managed to beat the Kobayashi Maru no-win scenario by
 reprogramming the test.
 
  Finally transported to the Enterprise, Kirk challenges Khan to the
 final battle within the Mutara Nebula, inside of which neither sensors nor
 deflector shields would operate, thus making the starships evenly matched.
 After a cat and mouse game, Khan is finally defeated, but, in a last act of
 vengeance, activates the Genesis Torpedo.
 
  Spock realizes that in order for the Enterprise to escape, he must
 get the main warp engines back on line, whatever the cost, so he enters the
 highly radioactive reaction chamber to restore the ship's warp drive.
 Spock's efforts succeed, and the Enterprise warps out of range of the
 Genesis explosion, but Kirk's jubilance is short-lived when he discovers
 their escape has cost the life of his closest friend and First Officer.
 After jettisoning Spock's coffin into space orbit of the newly formed
 Genesis planet the Enterprise returns home.

                                   1984

  The third picture in the STAR TREK movie series begins where the
 second film left off.  Grieving over the loss of Spock, the Enterprise crew
 returns home to Earth where they find that the Enterprise is to be
 decommissioned to make way for more state-of- the art space vessels.  Kirk
 later receives a visit from Spock's father, Sarek, who believes Kirk to be
 in posession of Spock's Katra, or living essence, and tells him that it
 must be returned with Spock's body, to Vulcan. 
 
  They later discover that Dr.  McCoy is in fact the keeper of the
 Katra.  McCoy must thus be taken to Genesis to recover Spock's body and
 bring it to its final resting place on Mount Seleya where his body and soul
 be re-fused into one complete entity. 
 
  Regardless of the cost, Kirk must put Spock's future before his
 career and with the help of his crew, Kirk steals the Enterprise from
 spacedock and escapes at warp speed to Genesis to complete his mission.

  The first Star Trek picture to feature both casts from the original
 series and the next generation.  The story begins with the launching of
 the USS Enterprise NCC- 1701 B and the mysterious disappearance of Captain
 James T.  Kirk.

  Seventy-eight years later, Captain Jean Luc Picard of the USS
 Enterprise NCC- 1701 D receives a distress call from a remote scientific
 observatory.  Picard learns that a newly developed weapon has been stolen
 by a desperate scientist with an insane plot.

  Facing the most difficult task of his career, Picard must seek out
 the one person with the power to help him, a person long thought dead:
 James T.  Kirk.  Together, the two captains will be tested as they've
 never been before.  Both men will be forced to make the greatest sacrifices
 of their careers to save countless millions from a madman with a plan for
 mass destruction.
