 Album:  Tattoed Millionaire
@{fg text}

 Holy was the preacher. 
 Riding on his rig of steel in the rising sun.
 This was no grim reaper.
 But a man with a smile who took a pride in a job well done.
 Ohh in a blood red sunrise.
 He's preaching conversion as you lay down and die.
 
 Just a god given holy roller. 
 In a god forsaken land.
 He didn't choose this killing ground.
 He didn't want this scrap of land.
 You've got to scorch the earth, yeah.
 and make the rivers run dry.
 Untill we learn to hate like him. 
 Kill for killin'. Live to die.

 CHORUS

 Ride on you son of a gun. Ride on. Ride into the setting sun.

 You've gotta be a hero, for one last time.
 To prove through your destruction.
 That killing is a great way of life.
 There's a wooden cross somewhere.
 Where they'll bury you down deep.
 You lie to your people, You lie to yourself.
 Your in love with death babe. 
 You've got no shame.

 CHORUS

 The preacher laughed. The preacher cried.
 He loaded bullets as he smiled.
 Congregation sat and wondered.
 Would they live or would they die.
 Just an ordinary man, with his orders and his plans.
 In the shadows of a cross.
 Oh in a blood red sunrise.
 Take me to jesus, with judas my guide.

 CHORUS

 Ride on your bleeding heart.
 Ride on you play no part.
 Ride on you feel no pity.
 Ride on you feel no pain.
 Ride into history.

@{fg text}

 Tattooed boys with expensive toys. 
 Living in a bubble of sin.
 Money can buy you most of anything.
 Fix your nose or the mess your in.
 Front page news you can share your views.
 With a population that wants to be like you.
 Out on the strip. Out on the tiles.
 Same old greed behind the PR smiles.

 You and all your entourage. To me your all the same.
 You and all your entourage. Playing foolish games.

 CHORUS

 I don't want your big city shining.
 I don't want your silver lining.
 I don't wanna be a tattooed millionaire.

 He's got a wife, she ain't no brain child.
 EX mud queen of Miami.
 In his stretch cadillac, he keeps her in the back.
 With his CD player and his bottle of Jack.
 LA dude. LA Attitude. Laid back, selfish and getting fat.
 Body gaurds, Porn Stars, Gold credit cards.
 Using each other. Running for cover.

 Born in a mining town in '58.
 When black and white TV was up to date.
 And men where still around.
 Who fought for freedom. Stood their ground and died.
 That I could be alive and see the damage,
 that we've managed since.
 In this septred isle. Is nothing sacred. 
 Just a one square mile.

 CHORUS

 Justice and Liberty. You can buy what you don't get free.
 In a world of steel and glass. We bury our past.

 On and On. We slept till dawn. When we awoke, we hardly spoke.

 My grandfather taught me how to fight.
 Old fashioned stuff like wrong and right.
 But all around I see his morals buried in a mess
 Of money troubles, Born in a mining town in '58.
 When black and white TV was up to date.
 And men where still around.
 Who fought for freedom, stood their ground and died.

 CHORUS

 On and On. We slept till dawn. 
 When we awoke, it was, all the same.

 Devil's driving down the track.
 Hell on wheels and it won't turn back.
 Engine racing down a one way street.
 Speed wheel chasing in a red line heat.
 Into the blackness. Into the night.
 Out of the tunnel. Into the light.
 Red for danger. That's just for show.
 Climb aboard. Come as you go.

 CHORUS

 Hard to steer when the devil's driving.
 Helens wheels and the brake's won't hold.
 Hard to steer when the devil's driving.
 Hell on wheels and the brake's won't hold.

 Too smart to come she just arrived.
 Only gave her one but she's using five.
 Minutes of time in the usual place.
 If I was strapped in you could sit on my place. (face)
 The door's were locked. The windows sealed.
 Hitting me with the jack was the devil's deal.
 Blue light flashing as the lipstick smudge.
 Diving for cover in a tunnel of glove.

 CHORUS

 Something's driving me. I don't know where.
 Something down in my cellar somewhere.
 Noone waiting for me down the line.
 Noone waiting for me this time.

 CHORUS

 Knuckle Down, Stick Shift, Take it slow.
 Easy come means easy go.
 Lay off the gas, make it last.
 Cuz under my hood she's blowin' fast.
 Into the blackness. Into the night.
 Out of the tunnel. Into the light.
 Red for danger thats just for show.
 Climb aboard. Come as you go.

 Drinking stale water, having to pay for the privelage.
 Talk about your freedom. I'll take you where I think it is.

 CHORUS

 Gypsy road. Is the highway that I run to.
 Gypsy road. Welcome to your dreams.
 Oh oh oh, Gypsy road.

 Living by my own rules. A rebel yell and a rebel creed.
 Keep your life simple. Try not to take what you don't need.
 Think about your freedom. Dream a little every day.
 Suddenly you'll find yourself there.
 Follow me. Walk this way.

 CHORUS

 I'll find my dreams. You find yours too.

 You're in the same pollution.

 Is all you need to know
 In the land of dreams
 You make the right connections
 then you'll be the hero...
 ecstasy...
 The cult of me provides
 our institutions
 You can live forever
 besides a grave that stands
 Where people used to function
 you can join
 The saviours of our culture
 vultures circling
 Overhead my sky
 like the sin of gluttony
 Won't set you free
 (but betty ford can help you try).

 You can get all the things
 you never needed
 You can sell people crap
 and make them eat it

 Where is our John Wayne
 Where is our sacred cowboys now?
 Where are the indians on the hill
 There's no indians left to kill

 People die with oxycen
 Andall their money
 can afford a breath
 People starving everywhere
 and staring in the face of death
 Prostituties and politicans
 laying in their beds together
 You can be the saviour

 Making up the policies

 In the darkness

 To find a reason

 Waiting for the winter sun,
 and the cold light of day,
 The misty chost of childhood fears...
 The pressure is building
 and I can't stay away.

 I throw myself into the sea,
 release the wave
 Let it wash over me,
 to face the fear
 I once believed
 The taers for the dragon,
 for you and for me.

 Where I was
 I had wings that couldn't fly
 Where I was
 I had tears I couldn't cry
 My emotions
 frozen in an icy lake
 I couldn't feel them
 until the ice began to break

 I have no prayer over this,
 you know I'm afraid
 The walls I built are crumbling
 the water is moving,
 I'm slipping away.

 Release the wave

 I'm vacuum breathing and open-mouthed

 minister my promises as her shadow cuts the day away
 I remember you as you walked into that room

 Dislocated jagged pieces
 are sliding into this broken mind
 swimming back against the river
 but I'm rising with the tide
 where we came from
 we're all going back there soon

 How many times have we met this way
 how many lives have we lived before
 how many faces and how many names
 shadows come but shadows are gone

 I see the scars of action writhing round your face
 too much inactivity and home's a lonely place
 throw away your beauty cos you know that it won't last
 throw away your present you've need living in the past

 Come on take a trip with me
 across the bridge of lunacy
 fire up some beast and ride the skywaves

 I've thrown away my images they're all so distant now
 discovery was a stranger then welcome to my house
 whatever demons torture me I love them like a friend
 nothing lasts forever but the certainty of change

 I'd rather move around and be that figure out life and what it means
 fire up some beast and ride the skywaves

 Don't wanna waste my time on you
 if you can't travel this way too
 fire up this beast we'll ride the skywaves

 And when the fireballs work is done
 and we are part of the nuclear one
 the whole Damn Thing begins again

 Our glory days have just begun -
 a fiery sideslip then we're gone...
 I'll see ya Monday morning...

 eyelids were burning, summer sun roasting
 tumbling chrome in the clear blue sky
 brighter than sunshine for all of our life times
 1000 stars turned day into night at the end

 Where were you when it fell from the sky?
 I saw the movie, I read the reply
 in the beginning there was only the word

 People were kissing in front of their shadows
 children were playing out in the yard
 I am not guilty I made no difference
 I wasn't born and I wasn't made on that day

 The acolytes fearful in the flickering light
 They hold a mirror, to catch the breath from your mouth
 And your breath was stolen, by the wind from the south

 Another winter's tale is done
 Your immortal lover - he's gone
 The chalice stolen from her hand,
 eternal life at her command
 [Now] all that she rules must sleep

 The howling shriek of death in your eyes
 The hawklord and the beast enter your room
 Your gold will turn to rust,
 your empire follows you
 into your tomb
 The wraiths of night caress
 and whisper softly now we are the dead
 They bear your life away
 They tear your heart in two
 They're taking the queen

 To some better place
 - So they think as the flame burns low

 Now the flame burns higher
 Purifies the love that died
 A stone rolls closed on a life
 Back to the earth...sealing the tomb
 Our skeletons rise through the veil of blood who summons
 us now from our graves, we are the dead
 The shriek of death in your eyes,
 the hawklord and the beast enter your room
 The wraiths of night caress and whisper softly now

 That hovers just beyond your bloody grasp
 Close enough to thrill the danger of the kill
 Price for failure of your will

 All of his sins of childhood
 He will remember
 He will not cry - tears he will not cry

 Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
 Man of sorrows, you loved without a trace
 If small boy wonders, what was it all about
 Is your journey over, has it just begun

 A vision of a new world, from the ashes of the old
 Do what thou wilt
 He screams, from his cursed soul
 A tortured seer, a prophet of our emptiness
 Wondering why, wondering why?

 Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
 Man of sorrows, you loved without a trace
 If small boy wonders, what was it all about
 Is your journey over, has it just begun

 A man of sorrows racked
 With thoughts that dare not speak their name
 trapped inside a body,
 make to feel only guilt and shame
 His anger all his life I hate myself he cried
 Do what thou wilt, do what thou wilt he cried

 Man of sorrows, I won't see your face

 Break the shackles of your union to the light

 To the other side of twilight he's waiting for me now
 Nativity was lost on me, I didn't ask I couldn't see,

 Feel our bodies breathing, as you try to stop believing
 There's nothing you can do about your shadows,
 You can't fight us you are like us and your body will betray you
 Lay down and die like all other others
 Where are the angels and their wings of freedom
 Jesus had his day off when they pulled you through

 I came through fire, came through water, through the oily serpent's kiss
 Climbed the mountain, chase the dragon, thrown myself in the abyss
 Do I make myself familiar to you now?
 'Coz I've been around you, and I'm glad I found you

 I am the living flame
 And I teach the holy games
 Teach the secret of the dance
 Throw the future in the runes
 Kick the sand in satan's face
 And I put Jesus in his place
 Shamen or priest's it's all the same
 The Magician is my name
 and magic is my game.

 Now I know you and you know me
 We have secrets we can share
 We can build a new tomorrow from the trash of yesterday

 The stone of night that weighs you down
 If you only could see the visions
 His hand is death if you take it now

 There is nothing that can save you now...

 Has wrapped itself around your spine
 So you look into its mouth
 And you kiss the pearly fangs divine

 The veil of flesh is ripped undone

 This is the maze of death
 This is the matrix of eternity
 The demon never sleeps
 The demon never lies
 He beats my heart and leaves no echo...

 What heavy burden holds me back
 Every step along the track?
 Fear that reaches deep inside of me...

 At the trumpets of Jericho
 Still the walls remain
 At the trumpets of Jericho
 Avalon's in chains

 This is the river of space
 This is the river of time
 Chase the dragons of infinity
 Atlas stands and laughs
 Throws his burden down
 Rolls the earth in the inferno...

 Fingers holding onto cracks
 The howling wind that blows us back
 Sucked into the grinding wheels of hell...

 At the trumpets of Jericho
 Still the walls remain
 Blow the trumpets of Jericho
 Still the walls remain
 At the end of the rainbow
 There the grail remains
 Sound the trumpets of Jericho
 Avalon's in chains...

 As they drag you down
 In your clothes of lead
 See the golden light
 Flashing overhead
 Mocking you...
 (hahahahahahahahahahahaha...)

 Do you know who you are
 In your robes of skin?
 How many creatures live inside you?

 Man is born forever free
 But is everywhere in chains
 Trapped inside this earthly prison cell...

 At the trumpets of Jericho
 Still the walls remain
 At the trumpets of Jericho
 Avalon's in chains
 At the trumpets of Jericho
 There the grail remains
 At the trumpets of Jericho
 Still the walls remain...
 Still the walls remain...
 Still the walls remain...
 Still the walls remain...

 The silence of the tomb...
 The wheel of fortune round...

 Turn the lights down in your soul
 Cut the power to your heart
 See the carcass in its dying rages...

 Machine men - cannibals of rust
 Machine men - iron bites the dust
 Machine men - built with feet of clay
 Are coming to sweep you all away...

 What bitter vampire made you this?
 Gave you life with its deathly kiss
 Ground your limbs to bloody stew
 Made a new machine of you

 Turned a nightmare into day
 Sucks your breath, takes your life away
 Beating harder through your veins
 Someone else's cold remains...

 Machine men - cannibals of rust

 Wash away the blackness with the silver rain
 Don't turn away - don't try to hide...

 Sulphurous and burning, spitting out the sun
 The beginning of creation, of the golden one
 A window to the west, a blazing star above
 In Taurus we begin it and the ladder has begun

 Don't try and blame me for your sins
 For the sun has burned me black
 Your hollow lives - this world in which we live
 I throw it back

 Four-headed dragon for the four degrees of fire
 Purify the insane, bring the solution ever higher
 Bring me all the elements, spread them round my head
 Bring me mad men's bodies, I will break them all like bread

 Don't try and blame me for your sins
 For the sun has burned me black
 Your hollow lives - this world in which we live
 I hurl it back

 Don't try and blame me for your games
 Your games are death
 My world is light - the angels fill my eyes
 With every breath...

 We lay in the same grave
 Our chemical wedding day

 And so we lay
 We lay in the same grave
 Our chemical wedding day

 And so we lay
 We lay in the same grave

 And all this vegetable world appeared on my left foot
 As a bright sandal, formed immortal of precious stones and gold

 I stooped down, and bound it on

 Before I met my baby didn't have a clue

 She wouldn't wag her tail or nothing at all until the furniture-man come
 Oh take it away, yeah, go on, let's guitar

 One time, baby, I took her for a walk
 Two timing bitch, I tried to squash her under a truck
 Three time looser, this ain't no game
 Five hand shuffle driving me insane
 I can't get it when I want it, when I call her she don't answer to her name

 We settle down into a laugh of bliss or so it seemed
 I adjusted to the endless wine and foodmixes end her talking to me
 It was hell, I tell you
 And when I dug my bone up, she threw my bone right back at me!

 Some...
 There's some harmonica?  In the ball?

 She had a note around her neck saying, "Take this one, she's free"

 A little high, little low,

 Mama, just killed a man,
 Put a gun against his head,
 Pulled my trigger, now he's dead,
 Mama, life had just begun,
 But now I've gone and thrown it all away
 Mama ooo,
 Didn't mean to make you cry
 If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
 Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

 Too late,my time has come,
 Sends shivers down my spine
 Body's aching all the time,
 Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
 Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

 I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

 Scaramouche, scaramouche will you do the Fandango

 Spare him his life from this monstrosity

 Will not let you go - let me go
 Will not let you go let me go
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no

 Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
 Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

 So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
 So you think you can love me and leave me to die
 Oh baby - Can't do this to me baby
 Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here

 It's not the thing I meant to do
 It's not the place I want to be

 Guess I'll keep on walking, baby, motown's gonna give me some clue...
  of what to do
 Can I travel on the sunny side when I think of where to hang my feet
  and what to do

 You'd better watch out how you drive that thing
 ?? spider's done it's dancing in the rain
 Tried a little shuffle but I never had the chance to move
 Try a different tune

 Say goodbye to it's children on a sleigh - ride to the moon
 Moonlight in the distance, not sorry I'm leaving you
 Now and then the earth dries, fills my eye
 Now and then the dark side fills the sky
 Turn around the starlight walks my skin
 Even in the blackness there's a tune

 Now that I'm not with you I close my eyes and dream
 Remember all my days as a prisoner of gravity
 I lived a piece of history and the future has begun
 Sat here with my feet hung up and nowhere is my home

 Now and then the earth dries, fills my dreams
 Squeeze my breast in anger, remember what it means
 Turn around the starlight walks my skin
 Every day in the blackness we begin
 We begin

 SOLO

 Now and then the earth dries, fills my eye
 Squeeze my breast in anger, remember what it means
 Turn around the starlight walks my skin

 Welcome back to the human race so very far from home
 I know I should be lonely but there's too much going on
 I lived this room of sadness when the firing had begun
 To leave behind your mayhem, your chemistry of me

@node "BRUCE DICKINSON"

@{b} BRUCE DICKINSON@{ub}

 To some, he is the Errol Flynn of rock - the swashbuckling, chandelier-
 swinging, irrepressible hero who swoops across the stage, slays the
 dragon, rescues the girl and delivers the killer lines. To others,
 he is simply one of the greatest white male singers to strut his stuff
 with a British rock band since the Seventies heyday of British vocal
 legends like Robert Plant, Paul Rodgers, Roger Daltrey, and, of course,
 his own personal favourite, Ian Gillan.

 Who else could I being talking about than Bruce Dickinson? The singer
 whose name and face, whose voice and songs, have all been synonymous
 with great Maiden music since his titanic debut album with the band,
 'Number Of The Beast', back in 1982.

 'The Air Raid Siren', Maiden fans dubbed him early on, and it was an
 apt description. With his soaring, almost operatic vocals and romping,
 over-the-top stage personality, musically, Bruce and Maiden have always
 seemed made for each other.

 As Bruce now recalls: "The first time I saw Maiden play, I knew they
 were the band for me. They were playing second fiddle at a club show
 in London, back in 1979, which my previous band Samson, were actually
 headlining. But they had so many fans and they were just so tight and
 together, they blew us all away really.

 "I'd always been a massive Deep Purple fan," he continues, "and that's
 what Maiden seemed to me to be back then - a modern Deep Purple.
 And I just knew I had to sing with them!"

 And so it came to be. Maiden had already released two Top 10 albums
 in the UK - 'Iron Maiden' in 1980, and 'Killers' the following year
 - when Bruce replaced original singer Paul Di'Anno in the line-up,
 and many long-time Maiden observers wondered, at the time, if the
 band had done the right thing in allowing the more theatrical former
 Samson singer to take over from the streetwise Di'Anno.

 They needn't have worried. Far from signifying a decline in their
 fortunes, Bruce's appointment to the band was the beginning of the
 most successful and era in Maiden's career to date. Kicking off with
 their biggest-selling single up 'til then, 'Run To The Hills' (one of
 the very first songs Bruce wrote with the band), and culminating over
 a decade later with 'Fear Of The Dark', his last studio album with the
 band (and Maiden's last to go to No.1 in the UK, in 1993), Bruce is
 now rightly regarded as the definitive Iron Maiden vocalist.

 Also known these days for his parallel talents as a novelist, RockRadio
 Network DJ, aeroplane pilot, video director, radio and MTV presenter,
 and occasional solo artist, Paul Bruce Dickinson was born on August
 7, 1958, in the small mining town of Worksop, Nottinghamshire. Why he
 chose to be called by his second name - Bruce - rather than his real
 first name - Paul - he says he can no longer remember, except that he
 insisted everybody call him 'Bruce' from "as early as I can remember.
 Only my parents were allowed to call me Paul. Maybe I thought it sounded
 a bit unusual or something," he grins.

 Mum, who worked in a shoe shop, and dad, who was a mechanic in the army,
 were still in their teens when baby Bruce was born, and to begin with
 he was brought up by his maternal grandparents.

 "I was very much an accident," he reflects. "I think that's partly why
 I grew up feeling like such an outsider. I didn't have an unhappy
 childhood, but it was unconventional, to say the least."

 Sent away to boarding school from an early age, the young Bruce grew
 up "very independent and self-sufficient." Qualities which would hold
 him in good stead later when it came to dealing with the perils of a
 20-year career in the notoriously fickle music business.

 The first record he managed to persuade his folks to buy him was the
 single, 'She Loves You', by The Beatles.

 "I was still only four or five but I really loved that whole Mersey
 scene. I loved The Beatles and Gerry & The Pacemakers, and used to try
 and collect all their singles. Then I noticed they had B-sides, and
 that sometimes I liked them even more than the A-sides. And that was
 when I first began noticing the difference between 'good' music and
 'bad'. I didn't know it at the time, but that was the first time I
 began to think like a musician."

 It was at boarding school as a teenager that he first began to get
 seriously into albums. "I was 13 when I first heard Deep Purple's
 'In Rock' album, and it just blew me away!" Soon his burgeoning record
 collection boasted albums by artists like Van Der Graaf Generator,
 Arthur Brown, Jethro Tull, and Emerson Lake & Palmer.

 "I had everything. My favourite was always Deep Purple, though.
 I just thought 'In Rock' was the greatest thing ever! And after
 that, everything else went out the window and I started getting
 into bands and buying the music papers. And then, of course,
 thinking about starting my own band..."

 Starting off as a would-be drummer - "I'd 'borrowed' these bongos from
 the music room!" - it wasn't long before Bruce became bold enough to
 push his way to the microphone.

 "I don't know why, I just sort of knew I could sing," he shrugs. School
 bands and a couple of short-lived college outfits like Styx, Speed,
 and Shots all gave Bruce the on stage experience he would need before
 taking his first crack at the big time with Samson.

 Formed around the songs of Sidcup-born guitarist Paul Samson, the band
 had already been singled out in the press, along with Maiden, Saxon,
 and Def Leppard, as one of the leading lights of the then burgeoning
 New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. 

 Writing most of the songs with Paul, Bruce - billed, bizarrely, as
 'Bruce Bruce' (from the old Monty Python sketch) - would make two
 albums with Samson: 'Head On', released in 1980, and 'Shock Tactics',
 in 1981.

 As Steve Harris says: "They were OK albums but what really interested
 me was the singing. Right from the very first time I heard Bruce singing
 on stage with Samson, I remember thinking, 'Blimey, that singer's fucking
 great!'"

 The rest of the world has been saying something similar ever since.
 Who else but Bruce would have been able to sing such tongue-twisting
 lyrics as those on Steve Harris-penned epics like 'Rime Of The Ancient
 Mariner', 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son', and 'Mother Russia'? And who
 else but Bruce would be able to spit out the venom as convincingly on
 trigger-happy face-offs like 'Be Quick Or Be Dead', 'Aces High', and
 'Holy Smoke?

 As Bruce says enigmatically:
 "I don't believe in endings. I only believe in new beginnings." 

 You have been warned...

@node "ADRIAN SMITH"

@{b} ADRIAN SMITH@{ub}

 For most long-standing Iron Maiden fans, the band as we remember them
 best really began to take shape with the arrival, in 1981, of guitarist
 Adrian Smith.

 Joining the band in time to record their second album, 'Killers', Adrian
 would prove to be not only a more than capable replacement for the exiting
 Dennis Stratton, but also, in fellow guitarist Dave Murray's words, "the
 best partner I'd ever had in Maiden, up to that point." - But then, not
 only was Adrian an excellent guitarist, he and Dave had known each other
 since they were at school together. Which perhaps explains why, as Adrian
 says, "there's almost a telepathy that exists between me and Dave, it's so
 spot on, it's uncanny. We just always know what the other one is about to
 do when we're playing." 

 In short, Adrian and Dave would become the perfect foil with which to
 make the trademark twin-lead guitar sound of Maiden back then work to
 its utmost potential. Then, as the years passed and each new Maiden
 album somehow managed to surpass the last, Adrian began revealing his
 talents as a songwriter, too, co-authoring, most often with singer
 Bruce Dickinson, but also with bassist Steve Harris and Dave, too,
 and eventually on his own, some of the best-remembered Maiden hits
 from the '80s. '2 Minutes To Midnight', 'Wasted Years', 'Stranger In
 A Strange Land', 'Can I Play With Madness', 'The Evil That Men Do'...
 the list of songs that began life as what Adrian calls "these little
 bits and pieces I come up with" is long and impressive. - As Steve
 says: "There's no doubting Adrian's talent, he even sings pretty well!
 And to have someone like him in the band really helped us come up with
 some interesting new ideas. He's so versatile, we were able to do things
 with Adrian we'd never been able to do before.

 Or as Adrian himself says: "The great thing about writing for Maiden is
 that the band has such a strong musical identity, you're always starting
 from a really good place. Like, if you fancy writing a fast one - well,
 there's no better band in the world for playing fast numbers!

 "Same with the slower, or more progressive type of things - again,
 there's no better band to take you into some strange musical places
 than Maiden. It's such an inspirational band to write for because it
 can do anything. And Steve would always encourage you to use your
 imagination and come up with something different from the usual 4/4
 beat thing most rock bands do all the time." 

 And yet, strange to relate, it so nearly didn't happen. Adrian had
 actually been offered the job in Maiden prior to the band going in
 to record their first eponymously-titled album, in January 1980,
 but had politely declined. A decision he quickly came to regret as
 the first Maiden album rocketed into the UK charts at No.4 just a
 few months later. 

 But then, as Adrian says: "I've never done anything just for the money.
 So I didn't regret it, really. I had my own band, Urchin, that I was
 still trying to get off the ground, and I think Steve respected that."

 "I suppose it was a bit like me with Maiden," says Steve, "Adrian had
 had Urchin going since he was at school and he rightly wanted to stick
 with it. I thought, fair enough, good luck to ya, mate! Then when we
 came back to him a year later, he was tempted I think 'cos he liked
 the band, he was a big mate of Davey's and Urchin was over by then
 anyway. And when he finally made up his mind to go for it with Maiden,
 he slotted in really quick." 

 Adrian was born in Hackney, east London, on February 27, 1957. The son
 of a painter and decorator, and the youngest child of three, he had
 what he describes now as "a typically happy, pretty boring upbringing,
 I suppose."

 A Manchester United football fan who later replaced the pictures on his
 bedroom wall of Georgie Best and Bobby Charlton with posters of Jimi
 Hendrix and Ritchie Blackmore, Adrian was 15 when he bought his first
 album: Deep Purple's 'Machine Head'. There was no looking back after
 that.

 "My sister used to go out with this guy and she used to borrow his
 records and leave them lying round the house. Stuff like Purple, Free,
 Black Sabbath... Then she stopped going out with him, so I started
 buying the records myself." 

 Dave Murray was the only other person he knew, he says, "that was into
 the same sort of thing as me." It was Dave who first encouraged Adrian
 to take up the guitar. "I noticed that whenever Dave brought his guitar
 to school he used to be surrounded by girls!" he chuckles. Soon the two
 were playing regularly together and had decided to form a band.
 So convinced was he of his destiny that Adrian left school at 16
 without even bothering to take his O-level exams. 

 "I thought, I'm going to be a rock star - I don't need all this!" he
 guffaws, before adding with a sad shake of his head: "It all seems so
 simple when you're still at school." - He was in for a rude awakening
 and while he was "waiting for something to happen" the would-be rock
 star worked a series of dead-end jobs: trainee spot-welder, apprentice
 cabinet maker, milkman..."I used to just lurk about until they got rid
 of me or I'd had enough and left - usually when there was a gig coming
 up." 

 The band he and Dave formed - Evil Ways - had now metamorphosed into
 Urchin. "Dave used to come and go," Adrian recalls. "Playing with me
 and then Maiden and then me again, then back to Maiden..."

 Looking back, he says "it was probably only a matter of time before
 I hooked up with Dave again." Fortunately for Adrian - and for his many
 fans - the band he did finally hook up with Dave again in was Iron Maiden.

 The rest, as they say, is history. The six studio albums Adrian recorded
 with Maiden in the '80s are still regarded as one of the most fertile
 - not to mention, successful - periods in the band's career.

 When he left the band, in 1990, to pursue a solo career, despite some
 excellent recordings, he admits now that, "it felt strange not being
 in the band any more. It had become a way of life for me and I realised
 how much Maiden will always be a part of me, and how much I missed it."

 The feeling, one suspected and knows now, was entirely mutual...

 He's that blur of hair and white Stratocaster that you first see
 buzzing round the top right hand corner of the stage. That madly
 whirling dervish who can't possibly be doing that and turning out
 those finely wrought guitar lines - can he?

 Yes, welcome to the totally wired world of Janick Gers - Iron Maiden's
 most over the top guitarist ever. Some accomplishment, given the
 contenders - not least Dave Murray himself, who became re-energised
 when Janick first joined the band as Adrian Smith's replacement,
 back in 1990.

 "Adrian and Janick are two completely different kinds of players,"
 explains Dave, who's been there since day one. "Adrian would have
 everything worked out before he went on, while Janick never prepares
 anything, he just goes with the flow. And he never stops moving.
 That's something else that was different to Adrian, who used to stand
 fairly still by comparison. But then, almost everybody looks like
 they're standing still next to Janick!"

 Janick Robert Gers was born in Hartlepool on January 27, 1957. His father
 had been in the Polish Navy, but settled in England after meeting his
 mother. (He later joined the British Royal Navy.) Swimming, football
 and music - "in that order" - were Janick's chief interests as a kid.
 It wasn't until he was in his teens that he began to take a serious
 interest in the guitar.

 "I started out wanting be John Lennon, then, once I got into the guitar
 properly, I decided Id rather be Ritchie Blackmore," he smiles. He was
 18 when he bought his first white Gibson Fender Stratocaster, a guitar
 he still uses now. "I got it second-hand from a guy in Darlington for
 two hundred quid and I remember thinking, 'Wow, this is fucking it!'"

 It was 1970 and his favourite bands were Deep Purple, Rory Gallagher,
 and T-Rex. Later he "became transfixed" by Led Zeppelin, but it was
 always Ritchie Blackmore's playing that "really did it for me. I thought,
 if I could be just a tenth as good as that, I could die happy."

 His first serious band was a local Hartlepool outfit called White Spirit,
 who he joined in 1975. Steeped in the music of Purple, Zeppelin and Rush,
 a single, 'Back To The Grind', was released on the independent label,
 Neat Records, in 1978.

 "It was a big deal for us up in the North East, but it meant nothing
 anywhere else. I was just happy to have a record out with my playing
 on it. But we were all still on the dole."

 Later signed to a major deal by MCA, their debut album, 'White Spirit',
 was released, ironically, the same year, 1980, that Maiden released
 their self-titled debut. But while Maiden - at the forefront of the
 then burgeoning New Wave of British Heavy Metal scene - watched their
 album soar into the UK charts at No.4, White Spirit was not nearly so
 well known, and their album fared considerably less well.

 "That whole NWOBHM thing passed us by, really" Janick admits. "We all
 used to moan that we didn't get enough attention from the media. But
 the truth is, Maiden simply made the better record. I can see that now."
 But it wasn't all gloom. When White Spirit supported Gillan on tour that
 year, Janick got to meet one of his life-long heroes, former Purple
 singer, Ian Gillan.

 "It was like getting to meet Father Christmas when you're a kid!" he
 laughs. When, just a few months later, he was invited to actually join
 Gillan, he was, he says, "absolutely gobsmacked!" A short-lived but
 highly productive period, in which Janick played on two of Gillan's
 finest albums, the live 'Double Trouble', a Top 10 hit in the UK, in
 1981, and 'Magic', another Top 10 entry in 1982, when Gillan decided
 after that to break up the band, Janick was philosophical.

 "I was disappointed but I thought, well, this gives me the chance to
 do something different." Having played in bands all his adult life, he
 took the unusual step of enrolling in college, where he took a course
 in Humanities. "While I was waiting for something else to come along,
 I thought I might as well do something useful," he explains simply.
 There had been talk, in 1986, of joining forces with former Twisted
 Sister singer Dee Snider, then some discussion about forming a band
 with ex-Maiden members, vocalist Paul Di'Anno and drummer Clive Burr,
 in the ludicrously named Gog Magog, which was also to have included
 ex-Def Leppard guitarist Pete Willis and former Whitesnake bassist
 Neil Murray. But nothing came of it and it was a guest appearance
 with Marillion at Wembley Arena, for the Prince's Trust, in 1988,
 that proved to be the catalyst that would finally seal his fate.

 Also on the bill that night was vocalist Bruce Dickinson, then still
 in Maiden. And when Bruce began work on his first solo album, 'Tattooed
 Millionaire', in 1990, it was to Janick he turned for help after being
 blown away by Marillion singer Fish's first solo album, 'Vigil In The
 Wilderness Of Mirrors', on which Janick co-wrote 'View From The Hill',
 one of the album's most affecting tracks.

 "I'd known Bruce since he was in Samson," Janick recalls. "He wanted
 to do something outside Maiden and I fitted the bill. Then when he
 called me up one day and asked if I'd rehearse some Maiden numbers,
 I was surprised. I said, 'What for?' He said, 'Adrian's left the band
 and we need somebody to fill in. Are you interested?' I was so
 flabbergasted, I didn't know what to say!"

 Although Janick joined too late to take part in much of the writing
 for the 'No Prayer For The Dying' album, he did have one song on
 there that would become one of their most notorious songs ever,
 the delightfully disrespectful, 'Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter'.

 "Bruce had this song that sounded a bit AC/DC-ish," Janick recalls.
 "And I said, 'Nah, it wants to be more like this...' So I put the chords
 in and then we re-did the chorus. It was great, so simple. And that was
 'Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter'."

 Originally conceived for the soundtrack of the movie, Nightmare On Elm
 Street - Part Five, the first time Steve Harris heard it, he says,
 "I said to Bruce, 'Look, this is too good to be lost on some movie
 soundtrack, let's do it in Maiden!" Which they duly did. Released as
 the second single from the 'No Prayer...' album, in January 1991,
 'Bring Your Daughter...' rocketed straight to the top of the UK charts,
 where it stayed for three gloriously non-PC weeks, becoming Maiden first
 ever UK No.1 single.

 Quite a start to his career. And he's been going from strength
 to strength ever since, as anyone will know who has witnessed more
 recent Janick-derived works like 'Lord Of The Flies' and 'The
 Unbeliever' - which he co-wrote with Steve on 1994's 'The X Factor'
 - or the beautifully poignant 'Como Estais Amigos' (rough translation:
 'How Are You My Friends') - which he co-wrote with vocalist Blaze on
 last year's 'Virtual XI'.

 The secret, he says, is not to have any secrets. "Just be yourself,
 that's my only advice."

 It's certainly worked for Janick.

@{b} BRUCE DICKINSON, ADRIAN SMITH & TRIBE OF GYPSY'es HISTORY@{ub}


@{b} PAUL BRUCE DICKINSON (vocals):@{ub}

 Born 8th of August 1958 and known as 'Bruce' to just about everyone
 except the registrar of births. 
 "I was born in Worksop, which is a mining town in the north of England.
 Now destroyed by a vindictive government. I was raised for the first few
 years by my grandparents, and my granddad was a face worker and a pretty
 cool tap dancer. I went to school there before moving on with my parents
 to nearby Sheffield... (Yes that is where Def Leppard came from as well
 as the Human League and Joe Cocker). 
 I went to school, did a lot of acting, and my parents worked really hard
 and offered to send me away to boarding school. Getting away from home
 seemed like a good idea so at the age of 13 I ended up at an English public
 school called Oundle... It's fair to say that I didn't fit in very well.
 I was thrown out at the age of 17 for pissing in the headmaster's dinner
 but had somehow managed to scrape the minimum for getting to London
 university to read history. By now I had discovered that I could sing
 and/or scream like a banshee. After I was chucked out I joined my first
 band back in Sheffield, and did a couple of gigs before disappearing off
 to London. Given half a chance I would have gone to acting school, but
 the parents would have never swallowed it. So history seemed like a good
 smoke screen. My student grant paid for my first P.A. system and I played
 in a bunch of metal bands right in the middle of the whole punk thing -
 unlike a lot of other metal bands I was quite a big fan of punk as well,
 but when it got trendy and The Guardian started writing about it I decided
 that it sucked. My fave bands were Bethnal, The Stranglers, The Lurkers
 and Splodgeness Abounds. 
 Anyway, I was spotted by a guy called Paul Samson who offered me a gig
 in his band, called unsurprisingly, Samson. The new wave of heavy metal
 was doing it's thang and we made a couple of albums. One of which was
 rather quaint, and one that was rather good. Paul was more into Blues
 which was OK, But I had my eye on the fire breathing dragon that
 IRON MAIDEN was turning into. I figured that I could really do things
 with that band." 
 The rest, as they say, is history. Bruce made five brilliant records with
 Maiden during the Eighties and two more in the early nineties. In 1993 he
 announced his intention to pursue his solo career. As a solo artist Bruce
 has now made five records:
 Tattooed Millionaire (1990),
 Balls To Picasso (1994),
 Skunkworks (1996),
 Accident of Birth (1997),
 and his latest The Chemical Wedding (1998 - Air Raid)


@{b} ADRIAM SMITH (guitar):@{ub}

 Born the 27th February, 1957, on the East side of London, Adrian left
 school at the age of fifteen to pursue his dream. It began in his family
 basement when Adrian, Dave Murray and a few friends formed the band
 'Evil Ways'. 
 For five years their gigs were mostly school dances and pubs but the
 breakthrough came when the band was signed by DJM records.
 This partnership produced two singles, two years of UK gigs and even a
 brief appearance on "Panorama". 
 By this time the band had changed its name to "Urchin" and had evolved
 into a 5 piece. In the late '70s Urchin parted ways with DJM, followed
 in 1979 by the band's own break up. Adrian wasn't out of work for long
 however, and in 1980 joined Iron Maiden. The next 10 years saw 6 world
 tours, 8 albums and numerous hit singles. 
 Next Adrian formed The Untouchables, "a sort of cross between ZZ Top
 and early Bryan Adams" says Adrian. The Untouchables mutated into
 Psycho Motel and the resulting album, 'State of Mind', was released
 in 1995 mixing full on Metal with retro-tinged guitars. Psycho Motel
 was put on ice when Adrian reunited with old Maiden band mate Bruce
 Dickinson for the successful completion of the 'Accident of Birth'
 album and, recorded a little over a year later, 'The Chemical Wedding'. 


@{b} TRIBE BAND:@{ub}

 Roy Z (Guitar), Eddie Casillias (Bass), David Ingraham (Drums)

 The members of the Tribe of Gypsies grew up in the gang infested turf
 on the toughest streets of the San Fernando Valley and East Los Angeles.
 It was the universal language of music that lead the away from a path
 of drugs, crime and gangs towards peace. Together they are a band with
 a mission, a purpose and a special vision. They would become a 'gang'
 in their own way. A musical gang who's sole purpose was to combine their
 distinct and varied talents in a musical form that not only reflected
 their proud heritage but was universally enjoyable. 
 The journey that led to the Tribe of Gypsies began when guitarist,
 songwriter and producer, Roy Z started a solo project that inspired him
 to form a band. The Tribe are his vision. His proud Hispanic heritage
 drew him towards his native and natural rhythms. He fervently studied
 the origin of percussion and the different forms of rhythm. After this
 period of regeneration Roy sought out long time friend and schoolmate
 Eddie Casillas who entered on bass bringing a big booming funky Latin
 style bottom end of the equation. Soon thereafter a powerful and diverse
 rhythm section of Doug Van Booven on congas, Mario Aguilar on timbales
 and David Ingraham on drums was in place. The band had already begun
 recording and deeply coveted vocalist Dean Ortega decided to join,
 The Tribe of Gypsies took flight. Later Van Booven was forced to
 leave the band and the Tribe were augmented by Elvis Ballatares and
 Rey Gonzales on keyboards. 
 Playing outside of the Hollywood spotlight, the Tribe built a rapid
 following in the clubs and one particular show at the Palamino elevated
 the Tribes fortunes. A rock journalist invited a few friends out to see
 the Tribe play, tipping them off that they were the most exciting new
 band around. They in turn invited along Shay Baby who at the time was
 engineering a BRUCE DICKINSON solo album for Keith Olson. Shay was so
 blown away he asked if he could mix the Tribe's album. With a meager
 budget that didn't look like much of an option, but Shay insisted on
 hearing the 2" masters. While he was loading up the tapes the Tribe
 soon had an unexpected new fan and friend. "I remember walking into
 Goodnight LA studios one night", Roy Z said, "to hear some of the mixes
 and in front of the console I saw this figure singing our songs at the
 top of his lungs. When I turned around it was BRUCE DICKINSON". Shay had
 turned BRUCE onto the Tribe and ended up producing DICKINSON'S solo album.
 A bond of friendship grew between BRUCE and the Tribe. BRUCE invited Roy
 to co-write songs for his second solo album, 'Balls to Picasso' and the
 Tribe of Gypsies recorded with BRUCE in London. Following his work with
 BRUCE, Roy produced and help write both the debut and new album with the
 metal hip-hop sensation Downset and produced Klover's 'Feel Lucky Punk'
 for Mercury Records. Finally after nearly a year in the studio with other
 bands Roy and the Tribe finally got the opportunity to finish nearly two
 full albums of songs.
