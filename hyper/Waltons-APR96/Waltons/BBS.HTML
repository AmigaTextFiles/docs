Thanks to a very good mate of mine, the BBS is running in <I>GHOST</I> mode.
By that I mean that all the files are on Walton Mountain's sister BBS. Prior
to the CRASH, we were able to back-up the BBS files onto his tape drive for
reference. When the computer / hard drive died, I had nowhere to restore it
to, so we popped it onto his BBS. I am also the co-sysop of that BBS.<p>
So where is it ...??<P><P>
Try :- <H2><B>(+44)181-907-1603 : BIG BUNGYS BATH TUB BBS</B></H2><P>
Gigs-a-room, 14.4k, 24hours, Amicon BBS, Nice bloke!!<p>
