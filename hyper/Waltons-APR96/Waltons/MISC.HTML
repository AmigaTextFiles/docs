Well, there are some people you believe, and are those you trust, and those
that just ain't worth asking. A while back, when my BBS was running, I was
'reliably' informed that my SCSI card would NOT run on the 4000.  It would
just about run a tape streamer I was told, but anything else ... nope not a chance.
Well here I am, a Amiga 4000 with that same SCSI card, with a DAT drive, a
520MB Hard Drive and a Toshiba CD-Rom, all working off that same SCSI card
that would only run a tape drive (if I was lucky). So I ask you, what is the
best advice to take?? I'd say that you take your own advice and sod every
one else! Experts - who needs them!

What to rave about - <p>
Amiga's for a start. Kewl machines. Why does every one I know ask "what PC
have you got?". Well being loyal - I say <B>THE AMIGA</B>.That fools them!<p>
DAT Drives - thanx to BUNGY I now have a nice little back-up device so that
i'll hopefully not lose any more DATA. NIce one mate!<p>
AMICON BBS S/W - Be honest, how many BBS's get you confused? Well it was loads
with me, but thanxs to the above s/w (by Paul ROFFEY) I managed to create one
of the best looking, and easiest to navigate BBS's around. If your in the market
then you could do a lot worse, and it's constantly updating.<p>
Got a 4000?? Got a CD-ROM?? Then you <I>MUST</I> get a audio lead from the drive
to the 3 pins on the motherboard close to the audio jacks. Now I can play my
fave CD's and have them come out through my speakers. A Must!<p>
