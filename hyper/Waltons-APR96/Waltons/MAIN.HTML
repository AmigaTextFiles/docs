<H1> <CENTER>Welcome to Volume #1 of Waltons Mountain Web Magazine - APRIL 1996</CENTER></H1><p>
<HR>
This is the first issue of the Waltons Mountain Web Magazine. For those of you who may recognize the name, i'll give a brief background about the BBS :-(<P>
I used to run a BBS - suprisingly called Waltons Mountain BBS. It was a popular UK London based BBS and had several mentions in Amiga related Magazines. Unfortunately the Hardware side went <I><B>BANG!</B></I> and the BBS came to a famous end. Although I had the files & users all backed up, I could not afford to buy the new hardware required to continue the BBS.<p>
 So it was RIP to the BBS.<p>
Anywayz - I thought that seeing that I could not run a BBS, I could set up a WWW site on my provider. Having duly contacted them I felt that it would be <I> CHEAPER </I> to design a Magazine and release it onto an unsuspecting audience and guage their reaction, so here goes!<p>

These pages were designed on <B> WEBMAKER 1.0 </B> and tested on AMosaic 2.0 beta and AWEB 1.0 - both are excellent Web Browsers and worth trying. The whole thing was put together on a Amiga 4000/040 with 16meg, 800MB drive space, CD-Rom and DAT backup. 
You can contact me @:-)
