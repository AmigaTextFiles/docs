 @{fg fill}Subject: 1. What is Netrek?@{fg text}

  Netrek is a 16-player graphical real-time battle simulation with a 
 Star Trek theme.  The game is divided into two teams of 8 (or less), who
 dogfight each other and attempt to conquer each other's planets.  There
 are several different types of ships, from fast, fragile scouts up to
 big, slow battleships; this allows a great deal of variance in play
 styles.

  Netrek is set up as a client/server combination; if you want to play,
 you'll need the client binary for your machine (most are X-based).


@{fg fill} Subject: 2. It sounds interesting; how do I get started?@{fg text}

  First, you need to get a client binary for your machine; read the 
 Netrek FTP List (which is usually posted along with this FAQ
 list) to find an FTP site.  The client should run on anything that
 runs X Windows, although the slower your machine is, the harder it's
 going to be to play.  Slow networks are even harder to play with.

 If you don't know how to use FTP, ask your local guru about it.

 If you don't have access to FTP, you can use the mail server at
 decwrl.dec.com.  Mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with 'help' in the body
 (nothing else) and you'll get an automatic reply with instructions.

 Once you have the binary, rename it to something logical like 'netrek'
 and run it with 'netrek -h <hostname> -p <port>'.  Read the Netrek Server
 List to find a server near you; the nearer, the better.

 If you get a 'netrek: Permission denied' message, try 'chmod 755 netrek'.
 After the game is over, try 'man chmod.'


 @{fg fill}Subject: 3. What's the difference between Xtrek and Netrek?@{fg text}

  Xtrek is a precursor to Netrek.  It has many of the same elements,
 but it doesn't work as well because it isn't set up as a client-server
 combination.  

 Unfortunately, Netrek is often called Xtrek.  This causes much confusion.
 This newsgroup really is dedicated to Netrek, but feel free to talk about
 Xtrek if you want; many people here play both.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 4. I've seen a game called Nettrek for the Macintosh; is that the 
          same thing as Netrek?@{fg text}

  No.  Nettrek is in the same family as Netrek (it's unclear which was
 created first), but it's not the same game.  It runs over Appletalk
 and doesn't have a whole lot of complexity.  If you're interested in it, 
 the original version can be found in most net archive sites that support
 Mac games.  The most recent version is a commercial program called
 "Nettrek 3.0 - The Real Version," and is published by Premiere Technology,
 Inc.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 5. Can I play Netrek on my Mac/IBM PC/Amiga?@{fg text}

  There is a playable client for the Amiga that runs over a Dnet connection 
 to a Unix host.  Read the Netrek FTP List to find out where you can get 
 it.

  There is a newly released client for a Macintosh connected to a Unix host;
 it's slow but playable.  There is also a client for Macs connected to the
 net via MacTCP (including SLIP/PPP) but it's not yet playable.

  If you are running Linux or 386BSD on your IBM PC, there are clients that
 will work, although at 14.4K baud they are kinda sluggish.  Look on 
 ftp.csua.berkeley.edu for information on how to run a client under Linux.

  If you have a machine running MS-Windows32 that is directly connected
 to the net, there are now clients you can use that are pretty good but
 still somewhat buggy.


@{fg fill} Subject: 6. I would like to start a new server; what kind of hardware will 
             I need?@{fg text}

  The server should run on anything that has Sys V shared memory and a good 
 amount of CPU power.  Good net connections are essential if you want
 lots of players.

 Read the Netrek FTP list to find out where you can get the server 
 source.

 Please get the permission of your sysadmins before setting up a server.
 Netrek doesn't need any additional bad publicity.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 7. I'm trying to start a new server, and I'm having problems.  Where 
             can I get help?@{fg text}

  Read the Netrek FTP list to find out where the server-secrets files are 
 stored (currently at gs69.sp.cs.cmu.edu).

  There is also a server maintainer's mailing list, netrek@iastate.edu.
 If you want to be put on the list, mail a short message to 
 netrek-request@iastate.edu and include the amount of C experience
 you have, how much you know about netrek code, and anything else
 that might be interesting.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 8. How do I get people to play my server?@{fg text}

  Generally, people call up the Metaserver (see below) and try to get into
 a game that already has people in it.  If your school has a bunch of
 people who play netrek, encourage them to use your server and people
 from other places will begin to.  If you don't have a local netrek
 population, log on to the machine yourself and fight Hosers.

  The other option is to modify the server enough that people are 
 interested in it for the novelty.  Several of the more popular servers
 have been created this way (Sturgeon and Paradise come to mind).  Keep
 in mind, if you do this, that you will attract weenies more than
 serious players.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 9. I compiled the client source, but every time I try to connect to
             a server it kicks me out or tells me to get a 'blessed' binary.  
             What gives?@{fg text}

  It's possible to modify the client source to do lots of tedious tasks
 (like aiming, dodging, that sort of thing) for you.  Since this gives
 you a big advantage over a mere human, netrek has a way of knowing whether
 you have a client that was compiled by the netrek Gods or by you.  If
 you compiled it, netrek will assume it's a cyborg, and will kick you out
 if it's not cyborg hours.  Check the Netrek Server List for cyborg
 hours of the servers; sometimes they're legal, sometimes they aren't.  

  There are several different messages you can get when your binary
 isn't what the server is expecting:

 1: "User binary failed to verify."

 The server is expecting a standard blessed client; read the netrek FTP
 list to find out where you can get one.

 2: "No customized binaries.  Please use a blessed one."

 You have an RSA client, but the key for your client isn't on the list.  
 Mail the server god if you think your key should be included.

 3: "You need a spiffy new RSA client for this server!"

 You have a standard blessed client (or an unblessed client) but the
 server accepts only RSA clients; read the netrek FTP list to find out
 where you can get one.

    If you are interested in playing a cyborg, get the source
 from one of the FTP sites and start hacking, or download one of the
 public cyborgs.  It's probably not a good idea for new players to
 use cyborgs; cyborg players get called lots of nasty names, and
 they tend not to learn how to play the game (since their client is
 doing most of the work).  There is a mailing list for borg authors, 
 mail trekwriter-request@b62103.student.cwru.edu to get on it.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 10. The game runs fine, but when the Netrek window comes up, I can't 
          type anything into it.  How can I fix this?@{fg text}

 This is a problem under a few window managers (OpenWindows and ovlwm, for
 example); it's netrek's fault, but you can fix it by adding the line
 "<window manager name>.FocusLenience: True" to your .Xdefaults file.
 Log out and log back in and it should work.  Also, sometimes moving the
 mouse cursor out of the netrek window and back in will fix it.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 11. OK, the game runs fine and I found a server and logged in, but 
              there doesn't seem to be anyone else around.  How can I find 
              a game with people in it?@{fg text}

 Andy McFadden has written a nice little utility called Metaserver II
 (based on METASERVER, written by ERic Mehlhaff) that will tell you
 where there are active games.  telnet metaserver.ecst.csuchico.edu 3520 
 lists all known servers and current number of players.  You can also try 
 telnet metaserver.ecst.csuchico 3521, 3522, 3523, or 3524 for more
information.


@{fg fill} Subject: 12. OK, now I'm in a game with other people.  What do I do?@{fg text}

 The first thing you should do is bring up your message window (by
 hitting '?') and your player list (by hitting 'L').  Pressing a number
 key chooses your warp speed.  The left mouse button fires torpedos at
 your cursor, the middle mouse button fires phasers at your cursor, and 
 the right mouse button turns your ship towards your cursor.  Hitting
 'h' will bring up a help window with a list of basic commands.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 13. When I'm playing the game, people keep sending messages to me.  
              How can I talk back to them?@{fg text}

 On the bottom right-hand side of your main window you'll see two 
 long boxes.  The top one is where messages like "Not enough fuel for
 phaser" come up just before you die.  The bottom one is the one you
 use to talk to people.  Move your cursor down there and type a character
 to choose who to send the message to: 'A' for ALL, the capitalized 
 team letter for the team (i.e., 'F' for Federation), or the player
 number for a message to a single player (i.e., 'c' to send to Rc).
 Type your message and hit enter when you're done.  Don't do this in
 combat.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 14. I would like to change what some of the keys do; for example, I'd
              like 't' instead of 'T' to activate my tractor beam.  Is there 
              a way to do this?@{fg text}

 There are two ways: first, do a shift-O.  This brings up the options
 window.  Near the bottom there is a box for 'New keymap entries'.  
 Move your cursor to this box and type your new keymap entries.  The
 format is <newchar><oldchar>, so 'tT' will remap tractor beam to 't'.

 Netrek also recognizes a .xtrekrc file; a 'keymap:' line in there 
 will allow you to map as many as you want.  Format is the same
 as above.

 If you forget where you mapped a key, remapping it to itself ('ee', for
 example) will reset that keymap.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 15. How does the rating/promotion system work?@{fg text}

  Do a shift-I on yourself; you'll see four ratings there, one for planets,
 one for bombing, one for offense, and one for defense.  The planet, 
 bombing, and offense ratings are measured in DI/hour; for each planet
 you take, army you bomb, and player you kill you get a certain amount
 of DI (which varies depending on the server)--the average amount per
 hour is your rating.  Your rating is equal to (your DI/your hours)/
 (total DI/total hours); therefore, if you have a bombing rating of
 2.0, you bomb twice as many armies as the average person on the server.
 This is true for all ratings.  All ratings are updated only in t-mode.

  Now do a shift-U.  Listed there are the thresholds for each rank.  
 Your overall rating is your planets+bombing+offense.  To make a rank,
 you need to have the DI required for that rank, and your ratings need
 to be above the rating required for that rank (i.e., to make Admiral,
 you need 320 DI and your ratings need to be above 8.0).  You can also
 make a ranking by having ratings good enough for a level and *twice*
 the DI you would need for the next level (So you can make Admiral 
 with ratings of 7.0 and 640 DI).  This equation is recursive, so you
 can also make it with 6.0 ratings and 1280 DI (which would take about 
 200 hours), or 5.0 ratings and 2560 DI (which would take 500).  On some
 servers the equation is recursive only once, so you can't make ranks on
 8xDI.

  On some servers, your defense also needs to be above .8 to advance
 past Lt. Commander.  

  Note that suggestions on how to improve the rating system occur
 about twice a week in rec.games.netrek, and the general consensus
 is that it isn't worth the hassle.


@{fg fill} Subject: 16. I keep dying.  How can I get better at the game?@{fg text}

  The best way is probably to talk with someone who knows how to play.
 There is also an archive of hints and suggestions on how to play 
 better; read the Netrek FTP List to find out where it is
 located.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 17. What is 't-mode'?@{fg text}

  T-mode is short for 'tournament mode.'  To keep some integrity in the
 database, ratings are calculated only when there are a certain number
 of people in the game (actually, when there are a certain number of
 people on two separate teams.  On many servers, you need 4 players
 on 2 different teams; 4 teams of 2 players won't do it).  When 
 the game goes into t-mode, there will be a 't' flag in your list
 of flags, and there will be a message like "Dan Quayle declares self
 as Galactic Emperor and chaos breaks out!"  When the game drops out
 of t-mode (because someone quit), the 't' flag will disappear and
 there'll be a "Dan Quayle is locked up and order returns to the galaxy"
 message.  

  It's generally considered rude to bomb or take planets out of t-mode.
 Some servers punish people for trying.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 18. What does DI stand for, anyway?@{fg text}

 Destruction Inflicted.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 19. Some of the servers and clients are called 'UDP'; what does 
              that mean?@{fg text}

  UDP is a network protocol that is much more lenient than TCP (which is 
 what netrek originally used).  If you don't have a local server, using a 
 UDP client on a UDP server could reduce your lag considerably.  
 Read the Netrek FTP List to find out where you can get a UDP client.
 (Many thanks to Andy McFadden, Netrek Guru, for implementing the UDP
 stuff).


@{fg fill} Subject: 20. Some of the servers and clients are called 'RSA'; what does
              that mean?@{fg text}

  RSA is a new way for servers to make sure that players are not using
 cyborg clients.  The RSA package generates a header file containing
 a public and a private encryption key.  These keys are compiled into
 the client; the private key encrypts the data and the public key
 decrypts it.  The main advantage of RSA over the old reserved.c
 method is that the server gods need know only the public key; the
 RSA package can be kept in a few select hands.  Also, if someone
 breaks the protection on a certain private key, that key can be
 turned off by the server god, and that client will no longer work.  


@{fg fill} Subject: 21. I keep reading about the INL; what is it?@{fg text}

  The INL is the International Netrek League, a collection of teams from 
 around the world who periodically beat up on each other.  Applications
 for the spring season are now closed; if you want to join an exsisting
 team, mail the captain or post on rec.games.netrek.  All INL administrative 
 stuff is available by anonymous FTP from ftp.csua.berkeley.edu, in the 
 directory /pub/netrek/INL (this includes directions on how to sign up).  Mail 
 tom@csua.berkeley.edu if you have any questions about the INL.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 22. I have some ideas and/or bug fixes for the INL server; 
              where should I send them?@{fg text}

  If it's a change to the game or the INL rules, you should mail the
 INL Council at inlcouncil@csua.berkeley.edu.  If it's just a bug
 fix or a new statistics idea or something, there's a mailing list
 for INL Server hackers at ihc@cs.montana.edu


 @{fg fill}Subject: 23. I'm looking at stats from a clue/INL game; what do all the
              abbreviations mean?@{fg text}

 Name: The player's name.
 team: The player's team and player number.
 min: Number of minutes the player was in the game.
 tpt: Total planets taken.
 tpb: Total planets destroyed (neutralized).
 tpb: Total planets bombed.
 tab: Total armies bombed.
 tac: Total armies carried.
 pad: Percentage of armies dropped.  In this case I carried 38 armies, 
      dropped 28 of those (on enemy planets or friendly planets needing 
      reinforcement), and was ogged with 10 (ow).
 fao: Friendly armies ogged (blew up on the carrier AGAIN?).
 eao: Enemy armies ogged (DOOSH!).
 tof: Total offense; a measure of how far away from the homeworld you were,
      compared to other team members.  Lower is further.
 eck: Enemy carriers killed (see eao).
 pck: Potential carriers killed (people with kills, but no armies).
 tek: Total enemies killed.
 fck: Friendly carriers killed (see fao).
 def: Deaths by enemy fire.
 acc: Actual carriers created; people who got their first kill from me and 
      picked up armies, or who got their second kill from me and picked up 
      3 or more armies.


 @{fg fill}Subject: 24. Where can I get the most recent copy of this FAQ list?@{fg text}

  You can either look in the back messages of rec.games.netrek, or
 get it via anonymous FTP from ftp.csua.berkeley.edu, directory /pub/netrek.
 It's also in the Usenet archive at rtfm.mit.edu.  
 telnet metaserver.ecst.csuchico.edu 3524 gives the server information 
 from the server list.

 Subject: clue outline for beginners
 Date: Sun, 06 Sep 92 17:13:18 -0400
 From: Herbert_Enderton@MORIARTY.THEORY.CS.CMU.EDU

 Jonathan, if you want to archive this outline here's a revised version
 (more recent than the one I posted).  This pretty much supercedes my
 previous posts with advice for beginners.  --Bert

 Every once in a while I try to write down the half-dozen things I would
 want to be sure to tell a novice netrek player.  Today I started to
 jot down an outline of the main things to learn, and I was surprised
 how many there are.  So here's the outline, roughly in the order
 I think people should learn the stuff in.  Hope it helps somebody.
 -- Red Shirt

 1) How to start up the game
    A) Run "netrek -h <server-name>" to connect to a given server.
    B) "telnet metaserver.ecst.csuchico.edu" to list servers and players
       counts.
       [replaced old reference to charon.amdahl.com -- JCH]
         i) Learn first on a nearly-empty server.
                 a) Fight practice robots.
         ii) Play where you don't get much lag.
         iii) Avoid borg servers and non-standard servers at least at first.
    C) Peruse the "motd", the information shown by the server.
    D) Join the team with the second-largest number of players.
         i) Wait 15 seconds or so while the numbers fluctuate.
    E) Turn UDP on (bring up menu with `+').
         i) If you get motionless torps cluttering your screen, try `='.
    F) Consider using an improved keymap even before learning the default one.
         i) `h' brings up a window showing most commands with the default
             keymap
 2) Basic flying controls:
    A) Setting course.
    B) Setting speed.
    C) Locking onto planets
    D) Slow down when you need to turn, otherwise consider going at max warp.
         i) Each increase in speed halves your turning rate
 3) Identifying friends and foes
    A) Know your race, and the enemy race.
         i) Declare peace with the two other races using the war window (`w')
    B) Galactic map
         i) See where you are.
         ii) See where the enemy ships are.
         iii) See where your teammates are.
         iv) See the cloakers, try to figure out who they are.
                 a) Alert status indicates presence of nearby enemy ships.
    C) Tactical map
         i) Learn what the various ships look like.
    D) Player list
         i) Bring it up with `L' (or your .xtrekrc may do this automatically)
         ii) See who's who.
         iii) See who has kills.
 4) Dodging torpedos.
    A) Friendly torpedos pass through you, but enemy torpedos hurt.
    B) Dodge by turning.
    C) Dodge by accelerating or decelerating.
    D) Seldom move straight at an enemy ship--makes it too hard to dodge.
 5) Phasering
    A) Hit nearby enemies with your phasers.
    B) Learn how close you need to be to do non-negligible (25+) damage.
    C) Ships have different strength phasers.
         i) E.g. at a given distance a CA's phaser does 15 more than a DD's.
 6) Firing torpedos
    A) Learn the "physics".
         i) Understand why chasing an enemy ship is so dangerous.
    B) Preferred targets are enemies who are flying towards you.
    C) Learn to lead torps so as to hit enemies who don't change course.
    D) Get a feel for the eight-torp limit.
         i) Learn how to abort your own torps when they miss.
    E) Good players will usually dodge your torpedos, so phasers are better.
 7) Refueling and repairing.
    A) Read your fuel and damage gauges.
         i) If using the status graph, make sure you get a good .xtrekrc so
            you don't have to place it with each new ship.
    B) Show resources on maps.
    C) Identify fuel and repair planets.
    D) Identify peaceful planets that you can use, and won't shoot at you.
    E) Lock onto the planet you want to use, and go at maximum speed.
    F) Enter repair mode once you're in orbit around the planet.
    G) Be prepared to raise shields and dodge if an enemy comes close.
    H) You can repair and refuel out in empty space, but it's slow.
 8) Using the message system.
    A) Show the message window with `?', splitting into four classes if
       desired.
    B) Learn how to send messages.
         i) With your mouse in the bottom of the two narrow windows below the
            galactic map, type `t' (for team messages) and the message.
         ii) You can also use `A' for messages to ALL, ship-number for messages
            to individuals, or F, R, K, or O to send to a team.
    C) Read and acknowledge team and personal messages.
    D) Try to notice messages as they come in.
    E) Be polite and friendly, but recognize that in a competitive game
       players probably won't take time to chat.
 9) Understanding planet ownership and armies.
    A) See which planets are owned by your team, which are owned by theirs.
    B) See how many armies there are on a planet by pointing and hitting info.
    C) Notice the planet destroyed and planet taken over messages.
         i) Learn the names of the planets.
    D) Watch your team lose planets.  Wish you could help them gain planets.
 10) Bombing
    A) Learn what planets are good to bomb.
         i) Only bomb enemy planets (not third-race planets)
         ii) Only bomb when it's t-mode (4 on 4 or whatever)
         iii) Can only bomb planets with 5 or more armies
         iv) Best to bomb undefended planets
    B) Lock onto a planet to bomb and get there as fast as possible.
    C) Enemy planets damage you when you're within a certain range.
         i) Keep your shields up when close, unless actually bombing.
         ii) It's okay strategically to let the planet kill you.
                 a) Better that than to nurse a crippled ship.
    D) Once in orbit, hit `b' to commence bombing.
    E) Watch the bombardier's messages to know when you're done (4 or fewer).
         i) When done, raise your shields and get out of there.
                 a) Ideally you've picked out your next target, and can
                    immediately lock onto it and hit max-warp.
    F) Cloak when trying to orbit an enemy planet, so you can't be tractored
       off
    G) Use an assault ship for bombing planets with many armies (or exactly 5)
         i) AS bombs 0 or 2-4 armies per half second instead of 0 or 1-3.
    H) Use a scout ship for running around bombing deep in enemy space.
    I) Even if all the enemy planets are "flat" (4 or fewer armies on each),
       it's useful to wait back near them so that when they "pop" to 5 or more
       you can race to bomb the armies before enemies beam them up.
 11) Taking planets
    A) Learn each ship's carrying capacity.
         i) Most ships can carry two armies for each kill they currently have
         ii) Assault ships can carry three armies per kill
         iii) Maximum load of 2 for SC, 5 for DD, 6 for BB, 10 for CA, 20 for
              AS
         iv) One usually shouldn't carry more than 6 armies.
    B) Learn beam up and beam down commands for picking up armies.
    C) When you beam up armies, send one distress call to inform your team.
    D) When you're carrying, the enemies will be out to get you.  Avoid them.
    E) Lock onto an undefended enemy planet, cloak, orbit it, bomb it if it
       has 5 or more, and then beam down all your armies.
    F) Don't dilly-dally.  The team wins which takes planets fastest.
    G) Some planets are better to take than others.
         i) Fuel planets are obviously good.
         ii) Agricultural worlds produce armies faster.
                 A) Get info on each planet so you know which are "Agri".
                 B) They produce armies very fast when they're at less than 4,
                    so don't expect to take one over in two trips.
         iii) There are other strategic considerations, but don't fret over
              them
                 A) This is a common source of pointless arguments
 12) Using tractors and pressors
    A) When fighting
         i) Tractor to close with an enemy ship, esp. when mutual death is good
         ii) Pressor to dodge torpedos (moving yourself away)
         iii) Tractor enemy into your torp stream
    B) To pull enemy out of orbit
         i) Instantly stops them from bombing, beaming, fueling.
    C) Don't leave tractors on too long or you'll run out of fuel.
    D) Each ship-type has a different tractor-beam range and strength.
 13) Mechanics of cloaking
    A) Cloakers don't appear on the tactical map, so watch the galactic
    B) Enemy cloakers within yellow- or red-alert show as ?? on the galactic
       map
         i) Also they're shown if they orbit a planet they don't own
         ii) When it's not t-mode they're always shown
    C) Friendly cloakers show as ?? on the galactic map always
    D) The position of the ?? is slightly randomized
    E) You can't fire weapons when cloaked
         i) You must come fully uncloaked before firing
    F) You can't use tractors or phasers when cloaked
         ii) But you can use them the instant you start to uncloak       
    G) You can bomb, beam, raise shields, detonate torps, and many other useful
       useful things while cloaked.
    H) A cloaker can't be tractored, but if a ship is tractored and then
       cloaks, the tractor beam stays on it.
    I) A phaser hit will reveal the location of a cloaker on the tactical map.
 14) Attacking enemy army-carriers (aka ogging)
    A) Know which enemies can carry by examining the player list.
    B) Track potential carriers on the galactic to see if they pick up armies.
    C) Predict what planet they'll go to.  Try to intercept them.
         i) Appear in front of them so they have the most trouble dodging.
    D) Cloaking on the approach sometimes helps
         i) To achieve surprise against unwary opponents
         ii) To help avoid getting killed as you approach
    E) Close in and fire quickly.  Use tractors, phasers, torpedos, and your
       own ship's explosion to kill the target.  Mutual destruction is good.
    F) Always try to dodge torpedos, so you can live long enough to kill.
         i) Don't fly exactly straight at the target, or he'll kill you easily
    G) You can defend a fuel planet against a cloaked enemy by orbiting
       it and firing.
         i) Otherwise, many players will stay cloaked and dodge until you're
            out of fuel, and then orbit and take the planet.
    H) Enemies are most vulnerable when in orbit
         i) They can't dodge well
         ii) You know more or less where they are
         iii) So fire at the planet while they're trying to bomb or beam down
         iv) You can also sometimes nail ships while they're beaming armies up
 15) Defending armies against bombers
    A) Look to kill them as they start to orbit.
    B) Chasing bombers is usually futile.  Better to stay near the
       armies you want to guard.
         i) Tell your team which planet you're defending, so they know
            not to duplicate your effort.
    C) Killing bombers is sometimes a good way to get a kill or two, but then
       switch to planet-taking or shuttling.  Don't lose sight of the goal.
    D) Shuttling armies from outlying planets to your home world (or to
       your starbase) is sometimes a good way to save them temporarily.
 16) Detonating enemy torpedos
    A) Learn the detonation range (somewhat server-dependent).
    B) Usually wise to detonate any torpedos that would otherwise hit you.
    C) Important to detonate if very near to other ships.
         i) Torpedos you detonate won't hurt your teammates at all.
         ii) Torpedos that hit you and explode will.
    D) Especially useful when orbiting.
 17) Clearing planets for army-carriers on your team.
    A) Attack enemies in the vicinity of the target planet
         i) Kill them or drive them off
         ii) Sometimes enough just to distract them by your presence.
         iii) Try to detonate torpedos that would hit the carrier.
    B) Attack ahead of your carrier.
    C) Once your carrier is in orbit about the target planet, avoid making
       violent torpedo and ship explosions in that area.
    D) Communication is important, so the carrier knows when you are
       going to crash the planet, and you know when he's ready for it.
 18) Helping army-carriers in other ways
    A) Intercepting oggers.  Get between your friend and the attacker,
       and shoot the attacker as he tries to get by you.
         i) Ideally you want to cripple but not kill the ogger.  If you
            kill him he just comes back with a fresh ship.
         ii) On the other hand if you kill him, you can go pick up armies
            and present him with a second target to worry about.
    B) When your army-carrier is approaching to attack the enemy home world,
       don't kill enemy ships except those near the home world.
    C) Decoys and double-attacks.  Attack or pretend to attack a planet other
       than the planet your friend is planning to take, and hope to draw the
       enemies towards you.  Stay cloaked so they don't know who you are.
 19) Helping to take break "last planet stands"
    A) Teamwork becomes essential.  Use the message window.
    B) You want one or two carriers, and the rest of the team should help
       by doing a well-timed run at the planet (clearing, decoying, etc).
    C) Synchronization is important, so set up roughly in a circle around
       the target and charge when the carrier calls `go'.
    D) Avoid engaging the enemy anywhere but right within shooting range
       of the target planet.  You must get there to be of any help.
         i) Exception:  if no one on your team has kills, get one.
         ii) Another exception:  if your carrier is retreating to refuel
             and/or pick up armies, he'll probably appreciate some cover.
 20) Refitting to another ship-type at your home world
    A) You have to mostly repair and refuel before it will let you refit.
    B) If you have 2+ kills and refit to a BB, CA, or DD, you get plasma.
         i) There's a special command for firing plasma.
         ii) Plasma torps costs a lot of fuel, but are big and track.
         iii) They can be exploded by phasers.  Best used against cloakers.
         iv) When they explode, they damage everybody nearby.
 21) Starbases
    A) Each team gets one starbase.  If it dies, there's 20 or 30 minute wait.
    B) Starbases are strong, but slow, and they can't bomb or take planets.
         i) Mainly they serve to control a small region of space.
         ii) Also they can hold up to 25 armies.
    C) Killing one usually requires a simultaneous attack by several ships
       coming in from different angles.
    D) You can lock on a starbase and dock to refuel, repair, and beam armies.
         i) A tractor beam or two facilitates fast docking.
 22) Genocide
    A) When a race's last planet gets destroyed they're genocided.
    B) When re-entering after being genocided, don't join the victors.
         i) Instead join the race diagonally opposite from your old race.
    C) When a race owns every planet in three quadrants, they win.
         i) At that point the galaxy is reset and all players are ejected.
 23) Team organization; Roles
    A) A good team often has 2 scout bombers, 3 oggers (who also clear
       planets),
       and 3 planet-takers (who also kill bombers).
    B) Volunteer for the role you like, and tell your team.
    C) Most players don't like being told what to do, but they like knowing
       what you're planning to do so they can coordinate with you.
 24) Places to get other information
    A) rec.games.netrek newsgroup
         i) The FAQ answers are posted regularly.
    B) jch's archive
         i) ftp gs69.sp.cs.cmu.edu, anonymous
    C) Ask veteran players for help

 Play first on a server that has nobody on it.  Read the instructions.
 Once you learn to fly and fire, you can send in practice robots, and
 learn to dodge their shots and lead them accurately with your torpedos.

 When you get into a real game, be sure you put up the message windows
 (with the `?' command).  It's important that you read the messages from
 your teammates, if any.  Sending messages is a little tricky; get somebody
 to show you how.

 Be sure to "declare peace" with the two neutral races, using the `w'
 command to pop up the appropriate window.

 Shoot at any nearby enemies (and don't shoot at ships that aren't enemies).
 Look at the long range map (the one on the right) to figure out where
 everybody is.  Cloaked ships show up as ?? on the long range display.

 The enemy ships are easiest to kill when they fly towards you, and you're
 most likely to die when you fly towards them.

 Figure out which planets are yours and which are theirs.  The commands
 `i', `B', and `V' are useful for displaying information about planets.
 When you run low on fuel, go to a friendly fuel planets (lock on to it
 with the `l' command.)  Bomb enemy planets when it's "tournament mode".

 The strategic objective of the game is to take over planets, but that's
 an advanced topic.  I assume that as a beginner you'll just want to blow
 people up.

 With new people coming on, I thought I should post this in the hopes that
 some people listen and learn.

 A) the 'c' button cloaks you.  DON'T push this button next to your home
    planet.
    When you become clueful, MAYBE you should do this, but until then don't
    ever consider it.  When you are near your LPS (last planet stand), do not
    cloak near your home planet.

 B) Cloak when you bomb.  If anything, you are harder to hit.

 C) This goes with B.  If an enemy doesn't cloak when orbiting your planet, use
    your tractors/pressors to push him off the planet.

 D) If you fly near an enemy planet with armies, please bomb it.

 E) If your side is hurting for armies, any planets nearby should be bombed
    down to 5 armies by a non-AS (non-Assault Ship).  THEN use an AS to bomb
    it.  It's amazing how many clueful players don't realize this.  They see
    a planet with armies, usually 6, and say don't bomb it unless in AS.
    However, in their defense, it does take a lot of typing to tell what one
    should do.

 F) The point of dogfighting (in strategic terms, not fun value) is to get
    kills.  The only reason to have kills is to get plasmas and take planets.
    My priority goes to taking planets.  So, once you have kills, you should
    start taking planets.  If you want to be a real addition to your team, one
    that people are happy when you show up, try to take planets whenever
    possible.  BUT, also realize that Admiral Veteran is probably better than
    you, and probably has a better chance of taking a planet than you do.  So,
    if armies are scarce, send a message telling him that you are taking the
    armies unless he wants them.  Usually, Admiral Veteran can escort you to
    the planet.  But, if he wants them, let him have them.  If armies are not
    scarce, then take as many planets as possible.

 G) When possible, ftp to gs69.sp.cs.cmu.edu, and read the hints.Z article and
    whatever other articles catch your attention.  These articles were written
    by some of the best in the game and has volumes of wisdom.

 H) Please read team messages.  And learn how to send them.  If people send
    messages such as "My teammates are f*cking idiots," you should take
    offense. Send messages back telling him this.  For instance, I send these
    messages because I know no one reads team messages, so I don't have to
    worry about hurting feelings.  People who complain that there teammates
    are clueless, and then don't tell them what to do if they get asked for
    help, are jerks.

 I) For the clueful, if you can think of anything else, post it.

 i agree with brian's remarks, except:

 Brian> B) Cloak when you bomb.

 don't bother cloaking if there aren't any enemy around, of course.

 Brian> E) If your side is hurting for armies, any planets nearby
 Brian> should be bombed down to 5 armies by a non-AS (non-Assault
 Brian> Ship).  THEN use an AS to bomb it.

 i think the extra confusion and time spent trying to do this more than
 offsets the benefit.  except in a LPS.

 Brian> F) The point of dogfighting (in strategic terms, not fun value)
 Brian> is to get kills.

 that's one reason, there are others.  at cmu, the technique of army
 defense is getting popular.  here, as soon as a planet pops, a
 defender rushes to the planet, even if they have no kill.  if they
 beat the bomber to the army, an honest-to-god dogfight ensues.

 dogfighting is also important in the 3rd race's space.

 Brian> The only reason to have kills is to get plasmas and take
 Brian> planets.  My priority goes to taking planets.

 i agree, and would make an even stronger statement: people with plasma
 are usually clueless.  you spend a lot of time flying home and
 refiting.  this goes for switching into an AS for planet taking also.
 i think it takes too long, and it broadcasts your intensions like
 nothing else.

 Brian> So, once you have kills, you should start taking planets.

 if you have a kill, and you are near some armies, and your designated
 planet scum isn't going to get them *really* soon, go ahead and pick
 them up.  drop them wherever is meaningful: enemy planet, your SB,
 reinforce, xfer to your planet scum.

 it's usually a bad thing for a team to have more than 1 person
 collecting armies.  it's a duplication of effort.

 Brian> H) Please read team messages.  And learn how to send them.

 i totally agree, and simply repeat this for emphasis.

 Subject: Some hints for beginners
 Date: 7 Jul 92 06:26:07 GMT

 While playing the base for hours on end Saturday night, I saw some things,
 some beginner mistakes that I thought I'd mention, in the hopes that people
 would read about them here and learn. I try to keep the clue level moving
 upward.

 1) If you want to get somewhere, move it. For example, if you're in a cruiser,
 don't fly to the front at warp 5, fly there at warp 7 (or more). Yes, you'll
 burn some fuel, but when you get to where you're going you can slow to warp 5
 and refuel, while being in position to do things. It's strategically
 inefficient not to take advantage of the refuel capability of your ship. And
 besides, what are you saving all that fuel for anyway?

 2) Unfortunately, I know what you're saving that fuel for: so you can miss
 more people with torps. You can generally figure the clue level of a game by
 seeing the hit frequency of the weapons: beginners tend to miss a lot.
 Granted, it takes practice to shoot well. But there are some guidlines
 that help:

 a) unless you're planning to kill or cripple your enemy, don't bother shooting
 at him. Lobbing a few torps as you fly by is inefficient, for the same reason
 as before: even if you get lucky enough to hit, all you're doing is giving the
 other guy's engineers something to do...he'll be completely repaired before
 one of your teammates can take advantage of the damage, so you're just using
 your fuel to let the enemy use his repair capability.

 b) Learn the ranges of your weapons. Again and again I see sprays of long
 range torps that are just a waste of fuel, because even if your aim is perfect
 on a non-dodging target, random spreading will keep you from getting more than
 about one hit (which does no good, as before). In general, don't shoot at a
 charging target more than 2 inches away, or 1 to 1 1/2 inches for targets
 moving perpendicular to the line joining you. Don't bother shooting at targets
 moving away from you, since they'll be trivial to dodge. Against targets who
 dodge well (forgive me if I stick myself in this category), lop another half
 inch off the torp range and be prepared to dodge aggressively. And learn to
 use your phasers properly: don't fire outside of the 20-30 damage range (which
 you can learn through practice, and watching that little window right below
 the galactic map which tells you how much phaserdamage you just did). On ships
 that are doomed but can still wiggle a bit, forget the torps and phaser the
 guy down: phasers are supposed to be your auto-hit weapons. I remember once
 I had softened up a base ogger and had him in tractor lock about two inches
 away, and three of my teammtes came up and fired 24 torps, which *all* missed.
 All they had to do was fire three phasers, and the guy would have been toast.

 You may wonder why I spend so much time harping on this. It's because fuel
 efficiency is such an important part of the game. Consider the difference
 between

 a) get a kill, pick up 2 armies from an adjacent planet, race to an enemy
 planet at maxwarp, cloak as you go in and beam down both armies.

 as opposed to

 b) get a kill, fly to a fuel planet, refuel, kill the same guy you killed
 before again, fly to a planet with armies, get ogged because you have 2 kills.
 All the time you spend refueling is wasted time where you aren't doing
 anything except letting the enemy get back into position. Teams which waste
 fuel tends to lose space control (you're retreating too often) and lose out
 on all sorts of attack opportunities. It's like spending half of the game not
 playing. Your strategic resources are fuel and armies, and you can't afford to
 waste either.

 3) I know this is an old one, but *don't* sit behind your base and lob torps
 and *plasma* (I'm not joking...) at oggers. Any of your weapons which hit near
 the base do damage to both base and ogger. Your base will *not* be pleased at
 taking more damage from teammates than from the enemy. 

 4) And finally, consider trying the fine art of subtlety. If you do the same
 thing over and over, you completely lose the advantage of surprise. You're not
 going to get a good og with me holding my mouse over your ship waiting for you
 to uncloak. Try something adaptive, something original. Even if it's bad, you
 just might get an enemy to bite. If you can't kill me, at least come up with
 something to cause me grief. Turn on the brain...sometimes I get the feeling
 people are playing without any cerebral functioning, and it really shows.

 From: "Timothy C. Worsley" <tw1r+@andrew.cmu.edu>
 Subject: Fooling the into thinking you have a clue.

         One thing that a lot of new players want to know is, "How can I
 convince people that I'm not clueless?"  It's a pretty good question. 
 It sucks to be spotted as clueless, because your teammates will insult
 you, and your enemies will try to scum kills off of you.  So here are
 some general tips to keep people from thinking you're clueless.

 General

 1) Keep moving.  Nothing gives away a total lack of clue like not
 moving.  Moving at the right speed is important too.  When you don't
 need to turn, maxwarp is good.  When you do need to turn (like when you
 want to fight) slow down to about 3 for BB, 4 for CA or AS, 5 for DD, or
 6 for SC.  As you get better, you will end up finding lots of other
 speeds to be useful.

 2) Look at the galactic map often -- every time you have a chance.  You
 have NO EXCUSE for not looking at it as soon as you come in every time. 
 If you see a cloaker nearby, check your alert status to see if there is
 an enemy nearby, or it it's a friendly cloaker.

 3) Read the player list so you have some idea of who's dangerous, and
 check the message board.  Again, you have no excuse for not doing this
 whenever you've just died.

 4) Read the archives, and R.G.N..  Not everything you will read is
 necessarily right, but you can at least get some idea for people's
 thoughts.  if you're really unsure, post.

 5) Always ID all the planets to see which at Agri.

 6) Play for a few hundred hours.  Nothing fools people like seeing your
 name a lot :)


 Fooling your Foes:

 1) Rebind your keys so that you can use all of the useful ones easily
 with your non-mouse hand.  MAKE SURE to rebind "tractor" and "det own
 torps".

 2) If you know that you are going to die, charge your opponent, and make
 her pay for it.  This is a good rule of thumb.  Crippling opponents is
 often better, but very difficult to get right, so stick with the basics
 at first.

 3) Learn your phaser ranges.

 4) If you are phasering, you should always be tractoring or pressoring.

 5) Watch your fuel.  If you are flying fast, watch e-temp too.

 6) If your foe does something really obnoxious, remember it, and try to
 learn it.

 7) If you do something really well, remember it, and look for your
 opponent to do it.

 8) If you are going to die, try to give the kill to someone who can't
 use it (SB, ship with many kills, crippled ship).


 Fooling your friends:

 1) Read the team bboard.  Respond if it seems appropriate.  If you have
 nothing better to do, help your friends do whatever they do.  This may
 include Ogging a base, escorting, or clearing a planet.

 2) If you and a friend are both going to get hit by torps, det them.

 3) Avoid the enemy base unless you're Ogging it.

 4) If armies are scarce, ask where they should be put.  If they're
 common, drop on any unguarded non-agri.  You should try to pick planets
 which are as close to home as possible, lower on armies already, or
 which have better resources.  If you have enough to actually take a
 planet, this is obviously better than reducing it, especially if it is
 Agri.

 5) Don't be afraid to ask for help.  You may not always (or even often)
 get it, but it doesn't hurt to try.  Distress whenever you pick up.  If
 you want your friends to find you quickly, flash your cloak on and off
 (WARNING: this may also alert foes).

 6) Be bold.

 I think the single most important thing that clue players do, and
 beginners *don't* do, is go where the armies are.

 This is important, because if you just walk up and try to fight me,
 I can go anywhere in the galaxy I want. I can run and run in circles
 all day, and you can never gain an advantage.

 However, armies don't run; they sit on planets. So, if you go to where
 the armies are, then to stop you I have to go to the same place, I
 can't run forever anymore. If you get to the armies before I do, then
 you have the combat advantage.

 You can learn just about everything from following armies, because all
 of the clue players will show up where the armies are, and you can just
 watch what they do and emulate them. Plus, watching the galactic to see
 where the armies are trains you to pay attention.

 If there aren't any convenient armies to deal with, the best algorithm
 is to keep moving away from your homeworld and towards the enemy homeworld.
 You usually don't want to charge, since this gets you splattered quickly,
 but keep pressing forward as fast as possible. If you can get to enemy
 spce, then you're in good position for when the armies do appear.

 From: kb32@andrew.cmu.edu (Kevin Bernatz)
 Subject: Sun Tzu's "Art of War"

 @{fg fill}Chapter 1 : Estimates@{fg text}

     War is a matter of vital importance to the state; a matter of life
 or death, the road either to survival or to ruin.  Hence, it is
 imperative that it be studied thoroughly.

     Therefore, appraise it in terms of the five fundamental factors and
 make comparisons of the various conditions of the antagonistic sides in
 order to ascertain the results of a war.  The first of these factors is
 politics; the second, weather; the third, terrain; the fourth, the
 commander; and the fifth, doctrine.  Politics means the thing which
 causes he people to be in harmony with their ruler so that they will
 follow him in disregard of their lives and without fear of any danger.
 Weather signifies night and day, cold and heat, fine days and rain, and
 change of seasons.  Terrain means distances, and refers to whether the
 ground is traversed with ease or difficulty and to whether it is open or
 constricted, and influences your chances of life or death.  The
 commander stands for the general's qualities of wisdom, sincerity,
 benevolence, courage, and strictness.  Doctrine is to be understood as
 the organization of the army, the gradations of rank among the officers,
 the regulations of supply routes, and the provision of military
 materials to the army.

     These five fundamental factors are familiar to every general.  Those
 who master them win; those who do not are defeated.  Therefore, in
 laying plans, compare the following seven elements, appraising them with
 the utmost care.

     1. Which ruler is wise and more able?

     2. Which commander is more talented?

     3. Which army obtains the advantages of nature and the terrain?

     4. In which army are regulations and instructions better carried
     out?

     5. Which troops are stronger?

     6. Which army has the better-trained officers and men?

     7. Which army administers rewards and punishments in a more
     enlightened and correct way?

     By means of these seven elements, I shall be able to forecast which
 side will be victorious and which will be defeated.

     The general who heeds my counsel is sure to win.  Such a general
 should be retained in command.  One who ignores my counsel is certain to
 be defeated.  Such a one should be dismissed.

     Having paid attention to my counsel and plans, the general must
 create a situation which will contribute to their accomplishment.  By
 "situation" I mean he should take the field situation into consideration
 and act in accordance with what is advantageous.

     All warfare is based on deception.  Therefore, when capable of
 attacking, feign incapacity; when active in moving troops, feign
 inactivity.  When near the enemy, make it seem that you are far away;
 when far away, make it seem that you are near.  Hold out baits to lure
 the enemy.  Strike the enemy when he is in disorder.  Prepare against
 the enemy when he is secure at all points.  Avoid the enemy for the time
 being when he is stronger.  If your opponent is of choleric temper, try
 to irritate him.  If he is arrogant, try to encourage his egotism.  If
 the enemy troops are well prepared after reorganization, try to wear
 them down.  If they are united, try to sow dissension among them.
 Attack the enemy where he is unprepared, and appear where you are not
 expected.  These are the keys to victory for a strategist.  It is not
 possible to formulate them in detail beforehand.

     Now, if the estimates made before a battle indicate victory, it is
 because careful calculations show that your conditions are more
 favorable than those of your enemy; if they indicate defeat, it is
 because careful calculations show that favorable conditions for a battle
 are fewer.  With more careful calculations, one can win; with less, one
 cannot.  How much less chance of victory has one who makes no
 calculations at all!  By this means, one can foresee the outcome of a
 battle.

 ------------------------------

 @{fg fill}Chapter 2 : Waging War@{fg text}

     In operations of war-when one thousand fast four-horse chariots one
 thousand heavy chariots, and one thousand mail-clad soldiers are
 required; when provisions are transported for a thousand li; when there
 are expenditures at home and at the front, and stipends for
 entertainment of envoys and advisers-the cost of materials such as glue
 and lacquer, and of chariots and armor, will amount to one thousand
 pieces of gold a day.  One hundred thousand troops may be dispatched
 only when this money is in hand.

     A speedy victory is the main object in war.  If this is long in
 coming, weapons are blunted and morale depressed.  If troops are
 attacking cities, their strength will be exhausted.  When the army
 engages in protracted campaigns, the resources of the state will fall
 short.  When your weapons are dulled and ardor dampened, your strength
 exhausted and treasure spent, the chieftains of the neighboring states
 will take advantage of your crisis to act.  In that case, no man,
 however wise, will be able to avert the disastrous consequences that
 ensue.  Thus, while we have heard of stupid haste in war, we have not
 yet seen a clever operation that was prolonged.  for there has never
 been a protracted war which benefited a country.  Therefore, those
 unable to understand the evils inherent in employing troops are equally
 unable to understand the advantageous ways of doing so.

     Those adept in waging war do not require a second levy of conscripts
 or more that two provisionings.  They carry military equipment from the
 homeland, but rely on the enemy for provisions.  Thus, the army is
 plentifully provided with food.

     When a country is impoverished by military operations, it is due to
 distant transportation; carrying supplies for great distances renders
 the people destitute.  Where troops are gathered, prices go up.  When
 prices rise, the wealth of the people is drained away.  When wealth is
 drained away, the people will be afflicted with urgent and heavy
 exactions.  With this loss of wealth and exhaustion of strength, the
 households in the country will be extremely poor and seven-tenths of
 their wealth dissipated.  As to government expenditures, those due to
 broken-down chariots, worn-out horses, armor and helmets, bows and
 arrows, spears and shields, protective mantlets, draft oxen, and wagons
 will amount to 60 percent of the total.

     Hence, a wise general sees to it that his troops feed on the enemy,
 for one zhong of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's
 own and one shi of the enemy's fodder to twenty shi of one's own.
     In order to make the soldiers courageous in overcoming the enemy,
 they must be roused to anger.  In order to capture more booty from the
 enemy, soldiers must have their rewards.

     Therefore, in chariot fighting when more than ten chariots are
 captured, reward those who take the first.  Replace the enemy's flags
 and banners with you own, mix the captured chariots with yours, and
 mount them.  Treat the prisoners of war well, and care for them.  This
 is called "winning a battle and becoming stronger."

     Hence, what is valued in war is victory, not prolonged operations.
 And the general who understands how to employ troops is the minister of
 the people's fate and arbiter of the nation's destiny.

 ------------------------------

 @{fg fill}Chapter 3 : Offensive Strategy@{fg text}

     Generally, in war the best policy is to take a state intact; to ruin
 it is inferior to this.  To capture the enemy's entire army is better
 than to destroy it; to take intact a regiment, a company, or a squad is
 better than to destroy them.  For to win one hundred victories in one
 hundred battles is not the acme of skill.  To subdue the enemy without
 fighting is the supreme excellence.

     Thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's
 strategy. Next best is to disrupt his alliances by diplomacy.  The next
 best is to attack his army.  And the worst policy is to attack cities.
 Attack cities only when there is no alternative because to prepare big
 shields and wagons and make ready the necessary arms and equipment
 require at least three months, and to pile up earthen ramps against the
 walls requires an additional three months.  The general, unable to
 control his impatience, will order his troops to swarm up the wall like
 ants, with the result that one-third of them will be killed without
 taking the city.  Such is the calamity of attacking cities.

     Thus, those skilled in war subdue the enemy's army without battle.
 They capture the enemy's cities without assaulting them and overthrow
 his state without protracted operations.  Their aim is to take all under
 heaven intact by strategic considerations.  Thus, their troops are not
 worn out and their gains will be complete.  This is the art of offensive
 strategy.

     Consequently, the art of using troops is this: When ten to the
 enemy's one, surround him.  When five times his strength, attack him.
 If double his strength, divide him.  If equally matched, you may engage
 him with some good plan.  If weaker numerically, be capable of
 withdrawing.  And if in all respects unequal, be capable of eluding him,
 for a small force is but booty for one more powerful if it fights
 recklessly.

     Now, the general is the assistant to the sovereign of the state.  If
 this assistance is all-embracing, the state will surely be strong; if
 defective, the state will certainly be weak.

     Now, there are three ways in which a sovereign can bring misfortune
 upon his army:

     1. When ignorant that the army should not advance, to order an
     advance; or when ignorant that it should not retire, to order a
     retirement.  This is described as "hobbling the army."

     2. When ignorant of military affairs, to interfere in their
     administration. This causes the officers to be perplexed.

     3. When ignorant of command problems, to interfere with the
     direction of the fighting.  This engenders doubts in the minds of
     the officers.

     If the army is confused and suspicious, neighboring rulers will take
 advantage of this and cause trouble.  This is what is meant by: "A
 confused army leads to another's victory."

     Thus, there are five points in which victory may be predicted:

     1. He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be
     victorious.

     2. He who understands how to fight in accordance with the strength
     of antagonistic forces will be victorious.

     3. He whose ranks are united in purpose will be victorious.

     4. He who is well prepared and lies in wait for an enemy who is not
     well prepared will be victorious.

     5. He whose generals are able and not interfered with by the
     sovereign will be victorious.

     It is in these five matters that the way to victory is known.

     Therefore, I say: Know your enemy and know yourself; in a hundred
 battles, you will never be defeated.  When you are ignorant of the enemy
 but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal.  If
 ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are sure to be defeated
 in every battle.

 @{fg fill}Chapter 4 : Dispositions@{fg text}

     The skillful warriors in ancient times first made themselves
 invincible and then awaited the enemy's moment of vulnerability.
 Invincibility depends on oneself, but the enemy' vulnerability on
 himself.  It follows that those skilled in war can make themselves
 invincible but cannot cause an enemy to be certainly vulnerable.
 Therefore, it can be said that, one may know how to win, but cannot
 necessarily do so.

     Defend yourself when you cannot defeat the enemy, and attack the
 enemy when you can.  One defends when his strangth is inadequate; he
 attacks when it is abundant.  Those who are skilled in defense hide
 themselves as under the nine-fold earth; those in attack flash forth as
 from above the ninefold heavens.  Thus, they are capable both of
 protecting themselves and of gaining a complete victory.

     To foresee a victory which the ordinary man can foresee is not the
 acme of excellence.  Neither is it if you triumph in battle and are
 universally acclaimed "expert," for to lift an autumn down requires no
 great strength, to distinguish between the sun and moon is no test of
 vision, to hear the thunderclap is no indication of acute hearing.  In
 ancient times, those called skilled in war conquered an enemy easily
 conquered.  And, therefore, the victories won by a master of war gain
 him neither reputation for wisdom nor merit for courage.  For he wins
 his victories without erring.  Without erring he establishes the
 certainty of his victory; he conquers an enemy already defeated.
 Therefore, the skillful commander takes up a position in which he cannot
 be defeated and misses no opportunity to overcome him enemy.  Thus, a
 victorious army always seeks battle after his plans indicate that
 victory is possible under them, whereas an army destined to defeat
 fights in the hope of winning but without any planning.  Those skilled
 in war cultivate their policies and strictly adhere to the laws and
 regulations.  Thus, it is in their power to control success.

     Now, the elements of the art of war are first, the measurement of
 space; second, the estimation of quantities; third, calculations;
 fourth, comparisons; and fifth, chances of victory.  Measurements of
 space are derived from the ground.  Quantities, comparisons from
 figures, and victory from comparisons.  Thus, a victorious army is as
 one yi balanced against a grain, and a defeated army is as a grain
 balanced against one yi.

     It is because of disposition that a victorious general is able to
 make his soldiers fight with the effect of pent-up waters which,
 suddenly released, plunge into a bottomless abyss.

 ------------------------------

 @{fg fill}Chapter 5 : Posture of Army@{fg text}

     Generally, management of a large force is the same as management of
 a few men.  It is a matter of organization.  And to direct a large force
 is the same as to direct a few men.  This is a matter of formations and
 signals.  That the army is certain to sustain the enemy's attack without
 suffering defeat is due to operations of the extraordinary and the
 normal forces.  Troops thrown against the enemy as a grindstone against
 eggs is an example of a solid acting upon a void.

     Generally, in battle, use the normal force to engage and use the
 extraordinary forces to win.  Now, the resources of those skilled in the
 use of extraordinary forces are as infinite as the heavens and earth, as
 inexhaustible as the flow of the great rivers, for they end and
 recommence - cyclical, as are the movements of the sun and moon.  They
 die away and are reborn - recurrent, as are the passing seasons.  The
 musical notes are the passing seasons.  The musical notes are only five
 in number, but their combinations are so infinite that one cannot
 visualize them all.  The flavors are only five in number, but their
 blends are so various that one cannot taste them all.  In battle, there
 are only the normal and extraordinary forces, but their combinations are
 limitless; none can comprehend them all.  For these two forces are
 mutually reproductive.  It is like moving in an endless circle.  Who can
 exhaust the possibility of their combination?

     When torrential water tosses boulders, it is because of its
 momentum; when the strike of a hawk breaks the body of its prey, it is
 because of timing.  Thus, the momentum of one skilled in war is
 overwhelming, and his attack precisely timed.  His potential is that of
 a fully drawn crossbow; his timing, that of the release of the trigger.

     In tumult and uproar, the battle seems chaotic, but there must be no
 disorder in one's own troops.  The battlefield may seem in confusion and
 chaos, but one's array must be in good order.  That will be proof
 against defeat.  Apparent confusion is a product of good order; apparent
 cowardice, of courage; apparent weakness, of strength.  Order of
 disorder depends on organization and direction; courage or cowardice on
 circumstances; strength or weakness on tactical dispositions.  Thus, one
 who is skilled at making the enemy move does so by creating a situation,
 according to which the enemy will act.  He entices the enemy with
 something he is certain to want.  He keeps the enemy on the move by
 holding out bait and then attacks him with picked troops.

     Therefore, a skilled commander seeks victory from the situation and
 does not demand it of his subordinates.  He selects suitable men and
 exploits the situation.  He who utilizes the situation uses his men in
 fighting as one rolls logs or stones.  Now, the nature of logs and
 stones is that on stable ground they are static; on a slope, they move.
 If square, they stop; if round, they roll.  Thus, the energy of troops
 skillfully commanded in battle may be compared to the momentum of round
 boulders which roll down from a mountain thousands of feet in height.

 ------------------------------

 @{fg fill}Chapter 6 : Void and Actuality@{fg text}

     Generally, he who occupies the field of battle first and awaits his
 enemy is at ease, and he who comes later to the scene and rushes into
 the fight is weary.  And, therefore, those skilled in war bring the
 enemy to the field of battle and are not brought there by him.  One able
 to make the enemy come of his own accord does so by offering him some
 advantage.  And one able to stop him from coming does so by preventing
 him.  Thus, when the enemy is at ease, be able to tire him, when well
 fed, to starve him, when at rest to make him move.

     Appear at places which he is unable to rescue; move swiftly in a
 direction where you are least expected.

     That you may march a thousand li without tiring yourself is because
 you travel where there is no enemy.  To be certain to take what you
 attack is to attack a place the enemy does not or cannot protect.  To be
 certain to hold what you defend is to defend a place the enemy dares not
 or is not able to attack.  Therefore, against those skilled in attack,
 the enemy does not know where to defend, and against the experts in
 defense, the enemy does not know where to attack.

     How subtle and insubstantial, that the expert leaves no trace.  How
 divinely mysterious, that he is inaudible.  Thus, he is master of his
 enemy's fate.  His offensive will be irresistible if he makes for his
 enemy's weak positions; he cannot be overtaken when he withdraws if he
 moves swiftly.  When I wish o give battle, my enemy, even though
 protected by high walls and deep moats, cannot help but engage me, for I
 attack a position he must relieve.  When I wish to avoid battle, I may
 defend myself simply be drawing a line on the ground; the enemy will be
 unable to attack me because I divert him from going where he wishes.

     If I am able to determine the enemy's dispositions while, at the
 same time, I conceal my own, then I can concentrate my forces and his
 must be divided.  And if I concentrate while he divides, I can use my
 entire strength to attack a fraction of his.  Therefore, I will be
 numerically superior.  Then, if I am able to use many to strike few at
 the selected point, those I deal with will fall into hopeless straits.
 The enemy must not know where I intend to give battle.  For if he does
 not know where I intend to give battle, he must prepare in a great many
 places.  And when he prepares in a great many places, those I have to
 fight in will be few.  For if he prepares to the front, his rear will be
 weak, and if to the rear, his front will be fragile.  If he strengthens
 his left, his right will be vulnerable, and if his right, there will be
 few troops on his left.  And when he sends troops everywhere, he will be
 weak everywhere.  Numerical weakness comes from having to guard against
 possible attacks; numerical strength from forcing the enemy to make
 these preparations against us.

     If one knows where and when a battle will be fought, his troops can
 march a thousand li and meet on the field.  But if one knows neither the
 battleground nor the day of battle, the left will be unable to aid the
 right and the right will be unable to aid the left, and the van will be
 unable to support the rear and the rear, the van.  How much more is this
 so when separated by several tens of li or, indeed, be even a few!
 Although I estimate the troops of Yue as many, of what benefit is this
 superiority with respect to the outcome of war?  Thus, I say that
 victory can be achieved.  For even if the enemy is numerically stronger,
 I can prevent him from engaging.

     Therefore, analyze the enemy's plans so that you will know his
 shortcomings as strong points.  Agitate him in order to ascertain the
 pattern of his movement.  Lure him out to reveal his dispositions and
 ascertain his position.  Launch a probing attack in order to learn where
 his strength is abundant and where deficient.  The ultimate in disposing
 one's troops is to conceal them without ascertainable shape.  Then the
 most penetrating spies cannot pry nor can the wise lay plans against
 you.  It is according to the situations that plans are laid for victory,
 but the multitude does not comprehend this.  Although everyone can see
 the outward aspects, none understands how the victory is achieved.
 Therefore, when a victory is won, one's tactics are not repeated.  One
 should always respond to circumstances in an infinite variety of ways.

     Now, an army may be likened to water, for just as flowing water
 avoids the heights and hastens to the lowlands, so an army should avoid
 strength and strike weakness.  And as water shapes its flow in
 accordance with the ground, so an army manages its victory in accordance
 with the situation of the enemy.  And as water has no constant form,
 there are in warfare no constant conditions.  Thus, one able to win the
 victory by modifying his tactics in accordance with the enemy situation
 may be said to be divine.  Of the five elements [water, fire, metal,
 wood, and earth], none is always predominant; of the four seasons, none
 lasts forever; of the days, some are long and some short, and the moon
 waxes and wanes.  That is also the law of employing troops.

 ------------------------------

 @{fg fill}Chapter 7 : Manuevering@{fg text}

     Normally, in war, the general receives his commands from the
 sovereign.  During the process from assembling his troops and mobilizing
 the people to blending the army into a harmonious entity and encamping
 it, nothing is more difficult than the art of maneuvering for
 advantageous positions.  What is difficult about it is to make the
 devious route the most direct routeand divert the enemy by enticing him
 with a bait.  So doing, you may set out after he does and arrive at the
 battlefield before him.  One able to do this shows the knowledge of the
 artifice of diversion.

     Therefore, both advantage and danger are inherent in maneuvering for
 an advantageous position.  One who sets the entire army in moriton with
 impediments to pursue an advantageous position will not attain it.  If
 he abandons the camp and all the impediments to contend for advantage,
 the stores will be lost.  Thus, if one orders his men to make forced
 marches without armor, stopping neithe day nor night, covering double
 the usual distance at a stretch, and doing a hundred li to wrest an
 advantage, it is probable that the commanders will be captured.  The
 stronger men will arrive first and the feeble ones will struggle along
 behind; so, if this method is used, only one-tenth of the army will
 reach its destination.  In a forced march of fifty li, the commander of
 the van will probably fall, but half the army will arrive.  Ina forced
 march of thirty li, just two-thirds will arrive.  It follows that an
 army which lacks heavy equipment, fodder, food, and stores will be lost.

     One who is not acquainted with the designs of his neighbors should
 not enter into aliances with them.  Those who do not know the conditions
 of mountains and forests, hazardous defiles, marshes and swamps, cannot
 conduct the march of an army.  Those who do not use local guides are
 unable to obtain the advantages of the ground.  Now, war is based on
 deception.  Move when it is advantageous and create changes in the
 situation by dispersal and concentration of forces,.  When campainging,
 be swift as the wind; in leisurely marching, majestic as the forest; in
 raiding and plundering, be fierce as fire; in standing, firm as the
 mountains.  When hiding, be as unfathomable as things behind the clouds;
 when moving, fall like a thunderbolt.  When you plunder the countryside,
 divide your forces.  When you conquer territory, defend strategic
 points.  Weigh the situation before you move.  He who knows the artifice
 of diversion will be victorious.  Such is the art of manuevering.

                    @{fg shine}GREY ELF'S GUIDE TO PLANET TAKING@{fg text}

                 This guy was the best.  Read his wisdom.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 From: jm79@andrew.cmu.edu
 Subject: Grey Elf's Guide to Planet Taking

 This a fairly long document, and has just about all the advice I can
 give on taking planets in netrek. The advice is freely given, not meant
 to be gospel, or necessarily helpful in any way. But, after some 300
 hours, and some 2000 planets, I think I know something about this
 planettaking business. Note that most of this advice assumes that you're
 trying to help your team win, not to build stats, although that's
 certainly part of the game.

      First of all, before anything, know what's going on. How you're
 going to take planets depends on which planets you're trying to take.
 Are you taking back your own space? You'll have to be careful with your
 armies as you don't have many. Are you taking planets in the third
 space? You probably need a fast ship. Taking core planets? You either
 need something really heavy, (an AS), or something really fast. Know how
 many kills you need, there might be a planet with only 1 army on it,
 that you can pick off with a 1 kill ship. If you're trying to take an
 agri, you're going to need two kills and at least 4 armies, and your
 effort will be wasted if you don't get them all down.

      Next, the key to winning the game is to take planets faster than
 the enemy is taking them back. There are a lot of skills to help you do
 this, but if you're serious about taking planets you don't have time to
 wander around trying to get your second kill. I'm sure that the most
 annoying thing about my playing style is just how FAST I can take
 planets when I'm playing well...over and over and over until the enemy
 is just plain out of planets. Grey Elf averages a planet every 9
 minutes, and that's in addition to anything else I do to help my team.
 The key is speed...you have no time to waste. I hate flying Destroyers
 because I always burn out my engines getting to where I want to go.

      To take planets, first you need kills. Getting kills falls under
 another chapter (Grey Elf's Guide to Making Yourself Useful) but I'll
 mention a few ways of getting quick kills. The classic method is twink
 bashing. It's cold, it's cheap, it works. You find someone with the nice
 0.3 kill ratio and get him to come after you. My favorite method is to
 let the guy get a decent phaser on me. Then I start to run and he says
 "I've got him now!" and charges forward right into my beautiful line of
 torps. It's scary how quick you can rack up kills if the enemies line up
 right.

      Another method is to get in front of your Starbase. If he's
 anywhere near the enemy he is probably attracting oggers...try to pick
 them off before your starbase gets at them. If he blows up someone
 you've just crippled, call him a kill thief and tell him you'd like some
 reward for destroying oggers for him.  He'll probably understand that
 you really want some kills to take planet. Note that I'm NOT advising
 you to sit behind your SB and scum a kill after he damages it...first of
 all it usually takes too long, and makes enemies to boot. You certainly
 don't want your team against you when you really need some help.

      A third way is to try to force enemies into an outnumbered
 situation.  This requires some skill in not getting killed, and is
 difficult if there are several people ogging indiscriminately, or ogging
 you in particular. Basically you try to get behind a person so he can't
 get away. Then you sandwich him between your torps/phasers and those of
 your teammates, and out of the random spread you have an even chance of
 getting a kill, better if your teammates aren't as good.

      Once you have kills, be careful. Good oggers will pinpoint anyone
 with more than 1 kill, and especially focus on known planet takers.
 Always watch the long range scanner for cloakers, and know if good
 players are headed in your direction. If you spend 5 minutes getting 2
 kills, you certainly don't want a batleship running you over when you
 least expect it. This holds true everywhere, at all times. Little sucks
 more than getting blown up at your home planet as you refit to an
 assault ship...especially if the guy them bombs the armies you were
 planning to pick up. (A little secret: when I head back to my home
 planet to refit to an assault ship, I pick up some armies from the front
 line and carrying them back with me...because there's no guarantee they
 will still be there when I get back).

      There are a couple of ways to deal with oggers. First, you have to
 know they are there. Watch the long range scanner at all times, even
 when dogfighting. Remember that your ship still has weapons, and use
 them. If you are planning to take planets, don't get in close with
 enemies...they may just be trying to suicide into you. I'm not
 encouraging people to runner-scum, but don't close with the enemy
 either. If an enemy is coming in cloaked, there are two things to do. If
 he's coming in very fast, either blast some torps into his path, since
 he can't dodge, or cloak just before he gets within phaser range. Slow,
 spin to the side, and speed up again...he will uncloak, go flying past
 you, miss with his torp spread (which you just dodged), and try to come
 back after you, now rather low on fuel. If he's coming in slow, fly away
 around warp 6, burning no fuel, and wait for the ogger to run out of
 fuel.  Then go do what you were before he got there. Remember that most
 oggs are ineffective unless you don't see it coming, are already hurt,
 or the ogger is really good. Also, let your teammates help you, but
 don't hide behind their coattails: if you're going to be effective you
 have to take some risks, and sometimes you get burned. Take your loss
 and come back fighting.

      What ship you choose to take planets in is a difficult choice.
 Everyone has their favorite fighting ship: I prefer cruisers. In some
 cases another ship might be more effective: you lose time in changing
 ships (less if your starbase is nearby), but a different ship might be
 able to do more. Each ship has a different style to it. Scouts are
 useful for taking planets that are left undefended and weak. You can
 slip in very quickly and beam down two armies, which can either take a
 planet or weaken it for the next person to show up. (This tactic can be
 very useful when the enemy is low on planets...letting other people take
 the planet with one kill ships).  Destroyers are exceptionally good for
 taking lightly defended planets since they can carry 5 armies and are
 both fast and manuverable. Heavier ships are more useful for taking well
 defended planets, since they can take the punishment of random torps.
 Remember that Assault ships can carry an army for every 0.33 kills...so
 an assault ship is much better for taking planets.  However, enemies
 know what assault ships can do, and will often suicide one without even
 checking how many kills it has.

      Another choice is how many armies to carry. This depends on what
 you are trying to do, and how many armies your team has to use or lose.
 If you expect that your team can defend the planet you're taking, only
 carry enough armies to leave one of yours on the planet, and let it
 grow. Carrying more is an invitation to be ogged, and is probably a
 waste unless you're sure that you can grab more than one planet in a
 single run. If you think your team can't defend the planet, and you're
 just taking it to deny it's growth to the enemy, try to carry enough to
 bring it to 3 or 4, so that the enemy will have to waste many armies to
 get it back. Again, carrying more is just an invitation to be ogged, and
 it actually reduces your effectiveness, because you'll be so timid
 defending your piles of armies that you won't be able to get anything
 done. Sometimes you gotta die to take a planet...If you are taking a
 planet that is heavily defended (like a last planet stand) then carrying
 more than 4 is probably useless, because you'll probably just die with
 them all, and there's no point in losing lots of armies at a time. Of
 course, it all depends on how many armies you have: if you have 15
 planets with 20 armies each, it doesn't really matter how many you die
 with, while if you have few armies you have to conserve every one you
 can get. To know where your armies are, set your longe range scanner to
 show the planet resources (hit "B" twice, or is it "V"...). Planets with
 more than 4 armies will have a picture of a little army on the left side
 of the planet. This makes it difficult to tell who owns which planets,
 but this trick helps: if you are using the standard ~games/bin client,
 or I think if you have the ~games fonts, then planets which are friendly
 to you have their names in boldface, while enemy planet's names appear
 in plain text. This makes it hard to identify independent planets (which
 look like yours, as well as friendly neutral planets), but I find that
 knowing where the extra armies are on every planet more than makes up
 for that difficulty.

      There are several different situations in which one takes planets.
 These are: your team is down, it's an even battle, you're driving the
 enemy back, you're trying to break core planets, or a last planet stand,
 or you're taking planets in the "third space": the planets originally
 belong to a team that was genocided. I'll discuss these in turn.

      If you are short on planets, you are probably also short on armies,
 so defending them is a must. Hordes of oggers will come for you as soon
 as you pick armeis up, if not sooner, so be ready. Don't just take a
 planet and fly away, because a planet with 1 army is easy pickings for
 anyone with a kill.  Stay and defend it, or make sure someone else is.
 Othewise, you might as well have died with the armies for all the good
 they did your team. If you have lots of armies (sometimes all your
 planets grow at once) it can be useful to save some on your starbase,
 rather than taking lots of planets that are easily taken back. Planets
 with 4 armies can't be taken by a 1 kill ship, while a planet with 1
 army can. Always take an agri first if your team has the ability to
 defend it, because it will grow armies much faster than a regular
 planet.  Who needs a home planet when you have an agri...

      If the game is fairly even, then you want to take planets fast and
 stop the enemy from retaking them. Again, you are probably low on
 armies, and should be making sure the enemy is too. Only carry 5 at a
 time...go back for more after you take a planet. Carrying more is just
 too risky at this point in the game. Take agris first, then fuel, then
 repair. Your team will love you for it :-)

      Try to con your team into clearing the planet so you can take it.
 If they aren't, you can try to clear it yourself, depending on how good
 you and the target are. If you think you need help, but aren't getting
 it, try this trick: wait for a teammate to get near, then fire some
 torps and try to get the enemy to shoot back. Toggle your shields a
 couple of times too. Look like your having a really tough battle.
 Hopefully your teammate will get the idea and come chase the enemy off.
 There's a lesson here that I'll mention again and again: people notice
 what happens on their short range scanner more than they notice the long
 range scanner. This is more true with less skilled players. If you want
 someone to notice you, do something on their short range view: if you
 don't want people to notice you, stay off their short range view. We all
 have tunnel vision, and often see only what we want to see. Use this to
 your advantage.

      As you advance into the enemy space, the game changes a bit. You
 start to have more armies than the enemy...you can afford to be more
 agressive in taking planets. Every army you kill is another blow, every
 planet is production lost by the enemy. A really strong push at this
 point can force the enemy into a last planet stand. The enemy will be
 fighting back hard, but they don't have enough people to defend all of
 their planets heavily. Use this to your advantage.

      Oggers have an easy time at you when you are in their space, so
 watch for them all of the time. Don't be conspicuous; just kind of fly
 around until you see an opening. The key is that, as time goes on,
 different enemy planets will become weakly defended. People fly around,
 and others get killed. What you have to do is be ready for an opening to
 occur, and JUMP on it before the opportunity closes again. What I like
 to do is pick a promising side of the enemy space and float...careful
 not to get on the short range scanner of any enemies. A lot of times,
 someone might be floating perfectly aimlesly, headed somewhere else, but
 will zero in on you if they see you at short range. Even if you kill
 them, you've lost valuable time and opportunity, plus the person might
 very well look at the kill list and send out an og call on you. I wait
 for something: sometimes a planet just gets left open. Other times a
 teammate causes a distraction which keeps the enemy fom looking at the
 long range scanner. (Remember, it's hard to look for cloakers when
 someone is shooting at you). Sometimes my team just blasts the enemy
 off. When a chance occurs, you have to MOVE, and fast. You may only have
 seconds to get the planet and get out before you are noticed. Cloak, and
 scream in at max warp. As you get close, slow down so you can dodge a
 bit. Slow down more as you get close to the planet, because you have to
 be going slow to orbit the planet. Keep your shields down as you go in
 (to conserve fuel), but keep your finger on the shields key so you can
 toggle them instantly. I usually raise them once I'm close enough to
 take damage from the planet. At this point there are four keys you need:
 bomb, beam down, det others torps, and shields (these are by default
 "b", "x", "d", and "u" or "s"). I find it useful to remap the bomb key
 to something near "x" and "d"; I use s. This way you can hit all three
 keys without looking down. It's also useful to have the resource display
 on the short range view: this way you can see if you should bomb before
 beaming down armies. As soon as you start orbiting the planet, start
 bombing or beaming down. Be prepared to det incoming torps, and to raise
 shields if it seems necessary. If someone fires a plasma at you, it's
 almost always better to raise the shields to take the plasma, then
 comtinue. Remember that raising shields stops you from attacking the
 planet, so you have to hit the bomb key again. Look for the army picture
 to disappear, then start beaming down. As you beam down, look back and
 forth betwen incoming torps and the little window above the message
 window which counts down the armies: 4..3..2..1..0..1..  As soon as
 you've beamed down all your armies, raise your shields and hit warp 6.
 Try to dodge torps on your way out, and punch it as soon as you are in
 the clear. Spin parry dodge. Lower your shields if no torps are hitting
 you, to save your fuel. Also, uncloak as soon as is feasible to avoid
 getting caught without any fuel. Head for the nearest friend and have
 him get in the way of the oncoming enemy hordes.

      For a beginner, it can be a real problem to remember which keys to
 hit, and to hit them in the right order. Practice on planets that aren't
 so defended: pretend there are enemies about, cloak, and take the planet
 as if someone were about to kill you. You never know, someone might
 be.....At all times, don't panic, and never give up: that battleship
 MIGHT just miss :-)

      Taking last planets is even tougher, because there are less
 openings.  Usually you'll have to beat one, two, or even more enemies to
 take the planet.  An assault ship is usually necessary for this, unless
 the defenders are really clueless. You have to pick your attack
 carefully; you can't just charge in and take the planet. Wait for things
 to look good. Bide your time: if the enemy only has one planet, they
 probably aren't coming back anytime soon. Wait for their admiral to fly
 away, THEN crash the planet. Always be ready; sometimes the enemy home
 planet will be totally undefended for just long enough to get in and
 take it. One of the best times to take a last planet is when the enemy
 has burned most of their fuel dealing with others: they might not have
 enough fuel to finish you off, especially if you det their torps for
 less damage.  Sometimes you'll wait for 15 minutes for those 3 seconds
 that the starbase drifts away from the planet. Only three seconds, but
 you're in and beaming down before he can find his plasma. Try to get the
 enemy to forget about you; let them deal with other people, and then
 suddenly pop out of nowhere to take the planet.

      As you fly in, you're expecting to get fired upon, so be ready for
 it.  Have one finger on the shields, and use your other fingers to
 change speeds. I usually try to slide in at about warp 5, dodging the
 enemy torps as I go in. I accelerate as I see a clear path to the
 planet, and hope I can orbit quickly.  Always remember that you'll
 probably have to lock on the planet again, as you've been spinning
 around in circles all this time. Once you lock on, keep the shields up
 and move your hand over the beam down key. As soon as you orbit, start
 beaming down, and have another finger ready to det the incoming torps.
 This is probably a suicide mission, so don't worry about what to do
 after you take the planet. Only stop beaming down if a plasma is
 incoming: then it might be worthwhile to take the plasma to the shields,
 then continue beaming down. Usually it's all over before you can think
 about making it out alive. If you somehow manage to get all your armies
 down, try to fly away and get to your friends...but even if you die,
 you've really done a lot for your team.

      If there's more than one defender, or the one is fairly good,
 you'll probably need help to take it. What you want is to have your
 enemies too busy to look at the long range scanner to see if cloakers
 are incoming. This usually means you want the distraction uncloaked, so
 that the enemies will focus on the distraction. Try to come in from a
 different angle; few people expect a planet taker to come from behind
 them. Make sure the good defenders are occupied, or have your teammates
 assigned to take them out. There are two plans: either have your
 teammates kill most of the defenders, or just keep them so busy that
 they won't see you. Killing works better at planets farther from the
 home planet, since the returning ships can't get back in time.  Killing
 also is needed against good players, because they are probably going to
 see the cloaker anyway.

      If you are helping someone take a last planet, your job is to keep
 the enemy busy...too busy. If there are only a few (3 or less), and no
 SB, then pick out the best of the defenders and suicide into him. They
 will all burn fuel shooting at you, and you'll take out the person most
 likely to kill your planet taker. The planettaker can then come in and
 take the planet in those few seconds before the enemy looks back at
 their long range scanner. If there are too many defenders for this to
 work, you have to be more sneaky. You somehow have to get the defenders
 to focus on you instead of the planettaker coming in from a different
 angle. One of my favorite tricks is to fly in cloaked, and then fly
 cloaked or uncloaked in the opposite direction from the real planet
 taker. If all goes well, the enemy will come chasing off after me while
 the real planet taker slips in behind before the defenders notice the
 deception. A lot depends on how good the defenders are: a few really
 clueful battleships can defend a planet against all comers.

      This is all well and good, but usually you just get blown to bits
 without getting a single army down. If this happens, hurry back out and
 get some more kills. Pick up more armies, and start floating around
 again. You know you're doing well if the enemy says "You have kills
 AGAIN???" Hang around, look, wait, and then sneak in from behind, and
 get blown to smithereens. Come back again...and often that third time,
 they'll have just a little too fuel, and be a little too far away...and
 it's all over.

      The last type of planet taking is when you are attacking the third
 space.  This is different because there are not as many ships there, and
 the planets are harder to defend. If you are invading this space,
 especially if is diagonally across from you, you should probably have a
 good army supply before trying, and should make sure the enemy is low on
 armies. There are two plans of attack: either have a fast ship (a
 destroyer probably, for fuel regeneration) that can shuttle armies
 quickly, or a many kill asault ship that takes several planets in one
 trip. This is one of the few times when it is good to carry many armies,
 although the transport needs to be well defended.  Some fighting ships
 should go along with the planet takers to bomb nearby armies (making it
 harder to take back the planets) and to kill enemies trying to fight
 back. Usually the best way to defend third space planets is by ogging;
 there's just too much space to concentrate on planets rather than planet
 takers. A planettaker needs to know this, and use the vast space to run
 in. There's another planet to be taken just around the corner...

      So that's the advice I have to give on planet taking. I'll just
 summarize:

 1) move: don't waste time

 2) get kills quickly

 3) watch for oggers always

 4) know what planets need to be taken, and who the defenders are

 5) choose the right ship and the right number of armies

 6) try not to attract attention

 7) try to get undefended planets

 8) wait for an opening, then jump on it

 9) attack when the enemy is too busy too deal with you

 10) come back again...and again...and again...eventually the enemy will 
 collapse

 And remember, there's little more satisfying than breaking a long last
 planet stand, or knowing that every player gets to see your name in the
 final message: : "Galaxy has been conquered by Ff (Grey Elf) and the
 Federation".  But the best compliment I ever got was when I took Romulus
 as a Fed three times in a row, and one of the Romulans sent to the all
 board: "damn elf".  Makes my day everytime I see that line.

 Good luck, and good netrekking!

 Greetings from Lance.

 Here is the manual I mentioned.  I posted it 'cause many people said I
 should.

 I only use a CA, so if you play another ship take any advice with a
 grain of salt (actually, take it all with a grain of salt.).

 There are, as I see it, 3 major things about successfully dogfighting.
 The most important, by far, is intensive use of tractors.  The second is
 to change speed constantly.  The third is to det incoming torps.

 Remapping the keyboard in the .xtrekrc file is important.  The y key for
 pressor (?), etc. is impossible to properly utilize.  For those
 interested, here's mine: dTeyadllrrqe D 
 I think some of that was redundant, but it works, so I don't care! :)

 I.    Tractoring/pressoring
 II.   Changing speeds
 III.  Detting
 IV.   Shields
 V.    Torps
 VI.   Phasers
 VII.  Cloaking
 VIII. Plasma
 IX.   Knowledge is half the battle :)
 X.    Interesting Tidbits

 I.  @{fg fill}Tractoring/pressoring@{fg text}

      A.  Tractors are most useful for holding an opponent in place so
          that your torps can catch up to him.  By tractoring an
          opponent, one a) slows the opponent's turning speed down for a
          short time and b) pulls him in the direction of your torps.
          THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT.  I can not tell you how many people
          have come rushing onto the screen that I have tractored, using
          their speed, and pulled them right onto a string of torps.

      B.  Tractors are also useful for pulling wounded enemies (and
          full-strength scouts) into your phaser range so that you can
          finish them off.  However, see III. Detting for more on that.

      C.  My favorite method of killing any enemy is to pull up next to
          him, speed up to warp 8 or 9, and on the pass launch a volley
          of torps and at the same time tractor him.  Fire the torps
          almost perpindicular to your ship, because at warp 8, they will
          move outward AND forward, hence slamming into the opponents
          ship.  I will also det his torps if they look like they might
          hurt me.  Sometimes, if the torps might not hit him, I pressor
          him, and sometimes, just sometimes, his rapid turning pushes
          him BACK into the string of torps.

      D.  In the opposing situation, if an enemy tries this on me, I turn
          in his direction and pressor off of him at the same time, which
          (most of the time) propels me out of his incoming swath of
          torps.  Pressors are most useful for maneuvering into and out
          of positions for battle. I don't use them extensively in battle
          but perhaps to keep a phaser-thirsty ship out of range so that
          I can torp him, or, in cases where there is a good BB playing,
          pressors are a key to survival.

 II.  @{fg fill}Changing speeds@{fg text}

      A.  It is important to change speeds constantly.  Many opponents
          tend to dodge torps I send at them.  However, when involved in
          a dogfight, and torps are flying in a perfect line at your
          ship, slam your hand down around the 7-8-9 area, and watch as
          your CA accelerates past the torps (I dogfight at 4).  A while
          back, I fought with West 11 or 12 times on an abandoned server.
          Against that kind of skill, I change speeds maybe, once very 3
          or 4 seconds, just to throw him off as to where I am going.
          That match ended in a tie or close to it.  Those 'lil matches
          took over a minute usually.  Learn to be patient.  The next
          entry, B, illustrates that.

      B.  The other day, I angered an opposing BB so much that he roared
          onto the screen firing a plasma and a blob of torps.  I calmly
          turned perpendicular to his plasma and accelerated.  That got
          me out of the torps' way and out of the possible turning radius
          of the plasma.  The BB then turned tail and slowly moved away
          from me, firing torps all the way.  By moving back and forth
          and calmly accelerating out of his torps I followed him all the
          way up to a fuel planet, never raising my shields or firing a
          shot.  He started orbiting the fuel planet, and I sped up to 8
          or 9 and roared by him, firing a volley of torps, tractoring
          him off the planet, detting, and phasering.  Needless to say,
          he died and I lost my shields.  But I was patient.

     C.   Also, remember to pressor oggers that appear behind you, as this
          will keep them from blowing up on you (I tend to tractor them,
          fire torps at them, and then pressor them, thus ensuring their
          death and preserving most of mine).  However, you must be going
          away from the ogger at at least warp 7 for this to work,
          because pressors only really neutralize the ogger's tractor.

     D.   When you are attempting to catch up to a target, and he is
          fleeing at similar speed, you can do 2 things: 1) If there are
          enemies in the area who could help him, you must get him
          quickly, so det torps sent in your direction.  2) If you and he
          are alone, if he fires a line at you, slam the 1-5 warp area
          and turn a little to the side.  This usually lets you dodge
          most of them, but he gets those few extra seconds to flee a
          little more.  However, if he has no help in the area, you might
          still have a chance of catching him.

 III.  @{fg fill}Detting.@{fg text}

      Here is the Netrek concept that will get me in trouble with other
 good dogfighters.  Most never det in battle.  I, however, live on
 detting.  I will cover detting on the "accepted scale" from A to C.

      A.  Det when tractoring scouts in and phaser them to death.  Scouts
          fire dinky 25 pt torps that do 6 pts of damage when det them.
          If you can tractor them and you are moving at sufficient speed,
          you can crunch a scout in a CA.  As long as you det.  This goes
          for any wounded ship, too.  If a CA is wounded and is sitting
          stopped, rush at an angle, fire torps and tractor him in.
          However, you MUST remember to det torps.  If you don't 10 to 1
          you will mutual with him.
   
      B.  Det torps for wounded ships, planet takers, and SB's.  If you
          want to be a good escort, stay AHEAD of the planet taker and
          det any torps headed for the planet.  However, REMEMBER to fire
          at incoming oggers, and if you must, mutual with any too close
          to the planet.
   
      C.  Det enemy torps to wound other enemies.  This I use only in
          special situations.  When a cloaker (planet taker) flies over
          enemy torps, det them.  You will take damage, but so will he.
          Any planet taker that slows down 'cause of wounds is usually
          dead in any clueful game.  Planet taking counts on the taker to
          make it to the planet as fast as possible before oggers
          overwhelm the escorts.

      D.  OK, I also det a lot in combat.  When I am dodging, I will
          often det to open a "hole" in a stream of torps, or det the
          first few torps in a string so that I can zoom by.  Remember,
          detting ideally only inflicts 25% of the damage on your ship,
          so detting 4 or 5 torps really is nothing in a CA.  I also tend
          to det whenever I make a pass at an enemy.  Granted, at one
          inch away those torps might not hit me, but I don't take the
          chance.  50-130 pts norm on a dogfight, I guess.  At one inch,
          one pass is usually enough :).  Some good players can use my
          detting against me, but not always.

      E.  You know those situations where you and an opponent suddenly
          zoom on the screen at the same time and right at each other?
          Usually, you will ram each other with a blob of torps.
          However, the best way to survive is to slam your hand down on
          the speed of 1-4, turn rapidly to one side, fire torps,
          pressor, and DET constantly.  About 50% of the time this will
          allow me to destroy the incoming ship, but I in turn usually
          take almost 80-90% damage.  However, I survive.

      F.  If you are in a situation where both you and your opponent are
          both wounded and he is taking pot shots at your ship, go into
          repair mode.  When he fires a torp, and you can't dodge it, det
          it.  Repair mode will usually repair enough shields for a 10 pt
          det.  This way you conserve your fuel.  Once you get enough
          fuel, start moving and unleash a full string of torps at the
          enemy.

      G.  If you are in a situation when you have enough fuel to kill a
          crippled ship but he is right on top of you and his explosion
          will kill you, pressor him away before phasering him and
          killing him (assuming he has no fuel).

 IV. @{fg fill} Shields@{fg text}

          Never keep your shields up all the time.  Your hull doesn't
          repair and your fuel regenerates slower.  Get in the habit of
          putting shields up ONLY when you are doing the following:

          1.  Approaching an enemy planet for bombing or planet taking.

          2.  Within about 3/4 the phaser distance of a CA or -->BB <--.

          3.  If torps are gonna hit ya.

          4.  If a cloaker is coming to ogg you and he is within phaser
              distance on the galactic.

          5.  If friends fire a lot of torps over you and an enemy is in
              the vicinity to det them on you.

          6.  It's fun to let a SC to get within phaser range: let him
              lock you a few times and he (sometimes) get cocky.  Once he
              turns around to engage you, tractor him in and kill him.

 V.   @{fg fill}Torps@{fg text}

      A.  Though I covered most of this in tractor, PRACTICE, PRACTICE,
          PRACTICE.  Some people here at Duke who program 'borgs say my
          torps are almost vector anyway.  I have been accused many times
          of having a 'blessed borg.'  It is because I practiced lots
          last year (this year I don't play very much anymore).  PRACTICE
          AIMING THOSE TORPS.  Learn to lead your opponent.

      B.  Don't det your own torps when you are first learning.  This is
          the lazy man's way of getting another shot.  When you are first
          learning, and you die cause your first shot missed, you will
          soon learn to start aiming better.  If, however, you keep
          detting your torps, you will waste all your fuel in no time and
          gain little experience from the situation.

 VI.  @{fg fill}Phasers@{fg text}

      A.  I use phasers when I make a pass at an enemy.  Usually it is
          the difference that kills him.  It is difficult to remember to
          tractor, torp 8 times, shields up, det, phaser, and move...but
          the extra 40 pt phaser sometimes is all you can get on the guy.

      B.  I don't suggest attempting to whittle down an enemy with
          phasers.  The only person I've ever known to do this
          effectively against me was Val, and he's gone...

 VII.  @{fg fill}Cloaking@{fg text}

      A.  Don't cloak (remember, this is a dogfighter's manual).

      B.  Cloaking is only for dodging 'outgoing oggers' (those coming to
          ogg you before you reach your target) or to pass over some
          interference dogfighters who are between you and your target.

      C.  Cloaking is for mainly planet takers and oggers.  That is NOT
          my forte.

 VIII.  @{fg fill}Plasma@{fg text}

      A.  Never use plasma.

      B.  However, plasma is useful when there is a solitary planet taker
          orbiting a planet and you are racing to it.  A plasma and a
          blob of 8 torps will usually do the trick.

      C.  SMACK!

 IX.  @{fg fill}"Knowledge is half the battle." :)@{fg text}

      A.  KNOW YOUR ENEMY.  Know what kinds of ships the bitmaps are.
          Learn what kind of shields and hull and torps and phasers each
          ship has.  Learn to add up quickly in your head, "Well, 3 torps
          and a decent phaser.  120 for the torps, 40 for the phaser.
          That CA is hurtin' and won't be able to flee from me for a
          bit..."

      B.  Keep track of your shields and your fuel.  Make sure you have
          enough fuel to get out of there, 'cause you might get 2 kills,
          but an ogger will rip you to shreads when ya have an empty
          tank.

      C.  Learn to cripple an enemy.  When you are rushing to say ogg a
          SB hanging around the enemy home planet or especially to take
          the home planet, NEVER kill oggers coming to engage the blob of
          escorts and planet takers you are moving with.  If you do so,
          you a) waste your own fuel and shields and momentum, and b)
          enable the enemy to reappear right next to your target with
          full everything.  Bad move.  Either cloak before you get to
          outgoing oggers, or hit them with 4 torps to cripple them <--
          This is possible.

 X.  @{fg fill}Interesting Tidbits@{fg text}

      A.  I don't really ogg...I usually uncloak about an inch from the
          player and depend on my aim to kill the guy...ogging would
          better be explained by MUCUS, _ensign, Val, and FreeKill.

      B.  Escorting
          
          1.  Fly in FRONT of the carrier.
  
          2.  Det torps that might hit him on the planet.

          3.  Oggers usually race onto the screen at full speed...  Use
              it to your advantage: tractor and jam 8 torps up his
              nose...  He can't dodge due to his high speed.

          4.  NEVER fire torps over your home planet when an enemy can
              det them on your carrier.

      C.   Flying Interference
            
           1.  If you are staying at an important front line planet, and
               you are flying "interference" in guarding it...  keep your
               eyes open for takers and their escorts massing below and
               call for help.

           2.  If ya get caught defending a planet against a mass of
               enemy ships, as I often do, good luck.  The best thing to
               do is 1) cloak and maneuver over the taker and det his
               escorts torps. 2) Distress a lot and move back and forth
               over the planet, firing a few torps to make enemy ships
               turn from their course.  In this case, you MUST survive
               long enough for help to arrive.  Most likely, on a clued
               game, you would be ogged by the escorts, but sometimes
               they hestitate too long and friendlies arrive.
           
 That's it!

 A lot of the "dogfight" tactics depend a great deal on what ship you are
 using, so it is harder to generalize in the same way you can with higher
 level strategic discussions.  Most of what I consider "dogfighting tactics"
 are really only a list of general ideas and philosophies that depends a
 great deal on who I am fighting and what is happening at the time.

 The biggest secret to dogfighting well is learning to use your tractors and
 pressors.  This is not really a secret, as everyone who is a good
 dogfighter will tell you about it, but until it becomes so natural that you
 don't think of T/P as any different from phasers and torps you will be able
 to fight with the best out there.  Speed and fuel management is second I
 think, and accuracy with phaser and torps runs behind these, IMHO.

 A couple of minor tactics that might be useful (these generally assume a CA
 v. CA engagement):

 -Tempt the enemy with down shields at the upper limit of their phaser range
 and pressor them every now and then.  When they take the bait and hit you
 with phasers you turn into them, tractor and accelerate, raise shields and
 follow up with a phaser of your own.  With practice you should be able to
 get all of these actions done within the span of the enemy's initial phaser
 recycle; a pressor and a turn after you get your phaser lock can then shear
 you away from them to limit damage from a folow-up phaser.

 -Jab the enemy with your pressors to goad them into upping their speed so
 that they can close the distance separating the two ships.  When they turn
 towards you switch to tractor and pull them in and unload a stream of torps
 and a phaser.  This is similar to your tractor charge except you get to
 retain more control over the engagement due to your low speed (and higher
 maneuverability) by using pressors prior to contact to get the enemy to
 increase their speed.

 -Use pressors to evade torp streams.  This sounds simple, but it seems few
 people do it.  You just turn in a direction perpendicular to the torp
 stream and pressor off the firer, you can usually get our of the
 torp-wobble arc from the stream just using pressors and a little bit of
 warp.  This is particularly useful if you are damaged but the enemy is not
 willing to close to knife-fighting range and risk a mutual; you can dance
 around their torps even at low-warp.

 -Torps do not have to hit the enemy to be effective.  You can set up a
 stream of torps to deny a direction of movement to the enemy and force them
 in a particular direction.  Most people will instinctively turn away from
 the stream instead of detting through it to break off the engagement.  This
 is also a useful tactic if you are double-teaming someone (to direct them
 towards your partner) or are being double-teamed (to split up the enemy so
 that you can engage them one at a time.

 -Get good positioning.  Try to decide where to fight before you start.
 Being able to fall back to a fuel or repair planet is an advantage you
 should try to set up if you can.  Be prepared to give ground, but expect
 them to take damage and lose fuel for the ground they gain from you. Make
 them need to get through you, this is not as easy as it may sound; if they
 want to avoid you it is best to force them to take a wide turn.  This is
 particularly important in the "space-control" style of dogfighting that is
 popular in recent INL play. 

 -Speed kills.  This is simple enough, but it seems a lot of people have
 this mistaken impression that they can maxwarp into a dogfight and survive
 (or even maxwarp _through_ a dogfight...)  If you are going at your max
 speed by the time the enemy is on your tactical you will be at a
 disadvantage because you _must_ slow down soon while the enemy can either
 accellerate or decellerate and use their increased options to gain an
 advantage over you.

 > 
 > Tractor-Charge.  
 [description deleted]

 This assumes your opponent does not know how to pressor.  Your tactic relys
 upon a constant tractor as a hook.  By selectivly using a pressor the
 tractor'd enemy can gain maneuverability and get around your torps.  This
 seems to gamble a lot of fuel on the question of whether or not the person
 you are fighting with knows what pressors are.  For most pick-up games this
 should work well but it is a big risk to take in a high clue game.

 Okay, here's the first draft of a guide about teamwork.  Comments
 are welcome.

   -- Red Shirt

 ======================================================================

 @{fg fill}Roles@{fg text}

 Tell your team that you'll be playing a certain role, such as
 scout-bomber, ogger, or escort, and then stick to it for a long time.
 That way they know what to expect from you, and thus can coordinate
 better with you.  Roles provide an easy way to manage the division of
 labor, helping to ensure that everything gets done, and helping to
 avoid redundancy.  You can make up your own job description, but here
 are some good ones I'm familiar with:

 Bomber.  Two types of bombers are the "passive bomber" who avoids
 fights and just tries to stay alive deep in enemy space to bomb any
 unguarded planets, the "aggressive bomber" who goes to bomb, but if an
 enemy was guarding or trying to pick up the armies, he'll often og.

 Ogger.  Attack the carriers, the potential carriers, and for good
 measure crash planets that the enemy is trying to guard.  They'll
 probably start to run away from you after a while, but you can use that
 to your advantage, e.g. scare everybody away and then bomb a planet.

 Escort.  Tries to achieve space control over an enemy planet that a
 teammate wants to drop armies on.  More about this in a later section.
 It's great to have somebody who essentially does nothing but escort,
 because then when I carry armies I can look for him, and have confidence
 that he isn't going to run away at the crucial moment.

 Planet-taker.  Because this requires having a kill, it often makes
 sense just to have everyone take planets when they can.  But if your
 team has lots of ships with kills and few armies, you really don't
 want to have everyone waiting around for armies and then racing each
 other to grab them.  So if you want to be the one guy who's waiting
 to grab armies that pop, tell your team.

 Front-line fighter, a.k.a. (passive) space controller or Brick Wall.
 This is most appropriate in even or near-even games.  Hang out near the
 front-line planets (both yours and theirs), prevent enemies from
 orbiting, help friends, kill carriers, cripple oggers, clear planets,
 and deal with front-line armies as the opportunity arises.  Good ship
 choices for this include CA, BB and SB.  Sometimes it's helpful to
 specify whether you'll hang out on the left side or the right side
 of the line.

 Anti-bomber, a.k.a. Lumchan mode.  Scum a kill off an enemy bomber,
 pick up armies and either use them or shuttle them to a hoard.
 A scout seems to work best.

 Army-guard.  If your team has a hoard of armies, say on the homeworld,
 and they have bombers threatening to strike it, you want one person
 within range at any one time.  This is a good way to get kills (if
 you're not a starbase), so I like to trade off with somebody:  whoever
 has fewer kills guards the army pile.  The army guard can also help
 intercept oggers for teammates who are limping back to pick up.
 Bases are adequate army-guards, but they can't use the kills they
 get from it.

 In our most successful games, TWNN led by Mucus Pig used one passive
 bomber, one aggressive bomber, one ogger, three front-line fighters,
 one planet-taker, and one army-guard.  We found it disruptive whenever
 we tried to switch roles mid-game.

 If the enemy team has many armies and our team has few or none, it
 behooves our planet-taker, anti-bomber, army-guard and escorts to take
 a minute or two off from their usual duties to help us bomb and ogg.
 Similarly, if both teams have armies but the enemies have many kills
 and more planets than us, then we should probably try to ogg all their
 potential carriers before taking any new planets; i.e. just hoard the
 armies for a couple minutes, because until we get the "kill list" down
 to size we're not going to be able to protect any planets you take.

 ======================================================================

 @{fg fill}Escorting@{fg text}

 Some basic facts to bear in mind:

 (1) A ship can't dodge when orbiting.
 (2) Enemies killed reappear near their home world, refreshed.
 (3) A ship in place has a huge tactical advantage over an enemy
     rushing towards it.
 (4) All cloakers look alike.
 (5) The enemy probably knows if you carry, but doesn't know where
     you're going or when.

 The proto-typical good escort is the guy that gets to the target planet
 a few seconds ahead of you (even though you go at maximum warp), kills
 the nearby defender (if any), and positions himself between the planet
 and any onrushing enemies so they can't get at you while you orbit.  
 It's like a screen in basketball, except for the part about killing.

 It's much less important to have escort by your side to deal with
 oggers as you fly towards the planet; you can often dodge and evade
 while flying at high speed, the problem is going to come when you
 get to the target planet and have to slow down.  In fact such an
 escort may hurt your cause if he kills an ogger you had successfully
 evaded and the ogger can return in time to defend the planet.

 Fakes and feints can be extraordinarily helpful.  E.g. say we're Feds,
 we own the Rom front line, and I'm trying to take Sirius.  I naturally
 send a distress call when I pick up, and I write "SIR".  Then I might
 head towards Draconis pretending that's what I want, and hope that the
 Romulan near Sirius bites on the feint and comes over to stop me.
 Meanwhile my escort is probably confused because I called for escort to
 Sirius, but with luck he'll position himself roughly between Drac and
 Sir, and when I turn and lock on Sir I fly past him and the Roms
 chasing me can't follow.  (In basketball I think the analogous concept
 is called the "total motion offense"; move the ball around to force the
 defense to shift, because their motion enables your screen tactics to
 work.)

 A faker is a ship that doesn't carry, and might not even have a kill,
 but cloaks and pretends to be trying to take a deep planet, in order to
 draw the defense to it.  This works best if the faker goes in well
 ahead, before the enemy is even alert to the real threat, and attacks a
 deeper planet, e.g. Tauri in this case, and stays alive and cloaked as
 long as possible.  This stuff really works, even against very clued
 opponents, and anyway it's good for a laugh.

 In typical pick-up games the main benefit of the escort may be simply
 to give the enemies somebody else to shoot at.  As long as the escort
 can stay alive uncloaked somewhere off to the side of the planet, the
 carrier has a good chance of success.  Sometimes an escort will nobly
 det torps and die to try to save me, and I'll wish that he had just
 dodged and lived a while longer.

 If you're a late arriving escort, i.e. your carrier is already trying
 to orbit by the time you get within range, there's very little you can
 do.  If you spray torps over the planet you'll likely kill her.
 Occasionally you can still usefully tractor and perhaps phaser a
 defender.  Alternatively, you can try to clear a neighboring planet in
 case your carrier wants to change her mind and cut over there, or be
 ready to intercept oggers if your carrier wants to escape.  In general
 you can't do much to help a teammate unless she flies towards you.
 And since escorts do well in bigger ships and carriers do well in
 faster ships, the escort should try to start pretty far ahead on
 any attack run, and may have to decide for himself what planet to clear.

 ======================================================================

 @{fg fill}Synchronization@{fg text}

 When the enemy is down to a few core planets and are mostly staying in
 their own space, you can't just go in at a random time and hope to get
 anything done.  Whether you're ogging, bombing, or carrying, if you're
 the only Fed in the Rom core you're just going to die.  Most pick-up
 games look like that:  each Fed ship takes a minute or so to fly up to
 Rom space, then they go in one or two at a time and they die.  What
 you want is for all the Fed ships to fly up to the perimeter of the danger
 zone and wait, and then all go in at about the same time.  Then
 for 20 seconds or so, you've got even odds tactically, e.g. eight Feds
 against eight Roms.  You might even get better than even odds if some
 Roms come out to og or bomb and you can "trap them up ice", i.e. get
 past them without killing them.  It doesn't really matter that all the
 Feds go to the same place or are trying to do the same thing; some
 could be ogging, some carrying, some looking to bomb, and some
 hopelessly crippled and just hoping to distract the enemy.  As
 indicated in the section on escorting, practically anything you do deep
 in enemy space is likely to help your planet-taker, even if you're at
 one planet and she's at another.  It's the timing which is the
 essential ingredient.  And unfortunately this ingredient is lacking 99%
 of the time.

 One way to synchronize such an attack wave is to designate one player,
 e.g. F2, to synch with.  Then all the other Feds should ideally keep
 track of F2 on the galactic map and plan to go in when he does.
 (Fakers and escorts might go in a little before, and carriers a little
 after).  F2 might signal the beginning of the attack run by sending
 "go" and/or cloaking.  It's way cool if all the Feds cloak for a
 few seconds at this point.

 Note that scumming kills is harmful when your teammates are going in.
 If you kill a Romulan and run away, you put him back on Romulus with a
 fresh ship, and abandon your teammates.  If both you and Romulan die
 that's probably even worse.  But of course scumming kills is an
 essential part of the game, so the idea is this:  let the whole team
 work on getting kills and armies for a while, and then when one or more
 of you is carrying and ready, then you set up the synchronized attack
 wave.  Of course your team might want to do the attack wave even
 without a carrier if there's important bombing or ogging to do.

 Also note that it's unrealistic to expect to get all your teammates to
 join in any venture.  But I've been in some games where we had just two
 ships synchronized, and after a while a third ship was convinced to
 join us, and our other scummy teammates would occasionally use the
 openings that we were naturally creating.  A little bit of coordination
 is better than none, and may lead to more.

 Subject: Traitors

 There's one section on the notes on teamwork that I didn't emphasize
 enough.  When you've got the enemy team down to an LPS (or near to
 that) involving their home or core world(s), there are two phases to
 the offense.  In the first phase you are trying to get kills, pick up
 armies, and refuel.  But once any of you have succeeded in that, the
 whole team is in phase two, where the goal is to get those armies
 delivered to the enemy planet(s).  During phase two, killing any enemy
 and enabling him to reappear nearer the target planet is a big mistake.
 Doing so consistently is treachery.  Understand?

 E.g. if I'm going in to try to drop armies on the last planet Tauri,
 and you kill a Romulan ship near Indi, you are a traitor, plain and
 simple.

 It's astonishing to me, on a team which is strong enough to get the
 enemy down to an LPS, how many of my teammates usually turn out to be
 traitors in this way.  Usually around 50%.  They mean well, mind you,
 but they are actively hurting the cause just the same.

 Starbases are almost always traitors in these situations.  A starbase
 with two escorts trying to keep it alive, that constitutes three
 traitors.  (On the other hand a SB can be very useful in phase one).

 One hint to avoid being a traitor, in situations where you can't make
 it to the target planet:  when the carrier goes in, cloak!  That way
 you'll be unlikely to kill anybody, you have some chance of survival
 yourself, and you might help to confuse the enemy.  Simply dodging
 and pressoring enemies works too.

 I'm going to stop calling my teammates traitors during games, because
 they really don't respond well, but I'll make a post like this every
 week if I have to, to get this point across.

 P.S.  The same concept applies in many other non-LPS situations, but
 is often complicated by other considerations.

 The At Large Strategy Guide

 I'd like to preface this with two comments.  First, these strategies
 have been designed so there is a minimal amount of message sending
 needed.  I'm sure there are improvements that can be made to them if you
 have large numbers of players in the same room.  Second, very little of
 this is actually my ideas, mostly it's from talking with other people
 and reading some posts.  Credit goes to:

 Sorry if I forgot to mention you.

 A lot of this will be intuitive to many people.  But there are new teams
 forming with the return of the college people in the fall.  If I missed
 something meaningful, or totally blew the space control description,
 send me some email.

 This was supposed to be a "strategy" guide, but to a large extent wound
 up being a ship level tactics guide.  To be honest, I don't see the
 difference, but the person who asked me to write this may have been
 expecting something different :-)



 @{fg fill}Opening bombing run:@{fg text}

 I'm going to write this section assuming there is a 17 army start, don't
 try to use this for a 30 army game!   

 Standard plan:
   Attack:
   To bomb enemy core planets initially SC's work best.  They are fast
   so can make it enemy core worlds (hopefully) before killed enemies
   reappear to scum them.  4 SC's to bomb the enemy core is a good
   number.  You will also want to AS bomb the front line on the first
   wave, this has two benefits:
         -their front planets are weakened (more than normal, since an
          AS is doing the bombing) and easier to take.
         -it is tougher for them to scum initially since they must
          return to core to get armies.

   Defense:
   There are 3 ships remaining for defense of armies, obviously one of
   these should be a SB.  The other two should be in CA's and act as
   follows:
         CA-1 acts as pressor fodder to get the SB to a planet and then
         defends the 2 worlds the SB will return too.
         CA-2 helps make sure the 2 worlds won't be bombed, and should
         be able to save one advanced planet if the opponent doesn't
         AS bomb it.   
         SB picks up from 1 or 2 planets and then sits between 2 planets
         to guard the army stockpile.  Ideally you'll have your base
         sitting near an AGRI.   

 Red shirt plan (feel free to correct it, this is from memory):
   Attack:
   Same
   Defense:  
   SB picks up from 2 worlds and advances to front line.
   CA-1 acts as pressor fodder, may be able to save a core planet.
   CA-2 guards front line planet.

   This is useful if you have a good base, since you have the benefit
   of a LOT of extra firepower up front.  If your base isn't quite as
   good you'll have to use the armies quickly.  1 CA should stay back
   to guard the saved planet (more on this later).




 @{fg fill}Mid game tactics:@{fg text}

 First, the basic plan.  It has the advantage that you don't need a
 good base, or very flexible SC players.   

 I'll start off with the SC bombers, generally any number from 1 to 3 is
 considered normal.  If you're feeling daring and want to crush them up
 front using 1 is good, and if you feel outclassed you probably want 3.
 In general the SC bombers are not responsible for bombing front line
 planets since they are easily scummed if they attempt this.  Note: if
 you use the 3 bomber plan you'll probably want the bombers to bomb the
 front at least some of the time.

 If your SB isn't very good (many INL teams shove some poor, unwilling
 player into it), and you want to keep it alive let it stay in your core.
 Stick it between your core AGRI and the nearest planet and let it farm
 armies to be used later.

 Everyone else should get into a CA and "space control".  I didn't have a
 really good idea about what this meant until about 5 months ago, and I'm
 still not good at it, but here are the basics:

   A long long time ago someone in California realized that chasing enemy
   ships just didn't work.  He put a note in the motd so new players
   wouldn't try to do this.  About a year ago someone realized that if
   the enemy is running at you, and you're moving slowly you have a
   similar effect.  So the idea is to get to the contested planet first,
   and then wait for your taker to arrive (instead of the old method
   where a fleet rushed over with the taker).  This way, if you get there
   first you can get into position in front of the planet and the enemy
   has to go *through* you if they want to kill the taker.  This is one
   reason ogging has declined, it is tough to dodge through 4 CA's
   (especially since phaser locking has improved).  Under this system
   the position of your ship is of great importance, it is often better
   to live with a wounded ship (even if you won't pick up armies).   


 The main job of the space controller are:
         hanging around front line to escort, break up escort
         harassing enemy SC bombers
         bombing enemy front
         using armies on front line
         using armies in core if no SC person has a kill
         crushing (almost) anything in your space when you reenter

 The escorting part is fairly easy, sit between their planets and their
 homeworld and wait.  If they don't attack you, eventually one of your
 carriers will try for the planet and you have perfect position to
 slaughter the attackers.  If they do attack you (and no one on your team
 is trying for the planet), give ground slowly and runnerscum them up
 until you reach your front line.  Then hold your ground.  One side note
 on this is don't always do the same thing, don't *always* do the same
 thing, being completely predictable puts you at a great disadvantage.

 If the enemy front (or possible side) pops, head over to bomb it.  One
 important note is that you should *NOT* run back to deal with enemies
 that get past you (excepting obvious situations like they're about to
 crush a crippled carrier).  Unless something very important is going on
 enemies that get past are none of your concern, try to hold your
 position at the front line.  An important side note to this is upon
 entering the game any CA's, AS's, or BB's in your space should be human
 targetted, scummed, or chased out.  Since your people at the front
 aren't going to deal with it, you have to do it when you reenter.

 In the event you get a kill, definitely pickup front line armies.
 Consider heading back to SB to pickup.

 Finally, you can really annoy the enemy SC bombers but making them go
 all the way around the front line.  If they seem to be cutting it close,
 maxwarp across the front line to force them to cloak and cut wider.  You
 don't even have to shoot at them (take a giveaway kill, but don't bother
 phasering away half their shields), just make them burn fuel and etemp.
 This is highly underrated as a tactic.

 This is a good strategy for begining teams.  There is not a lot of
 complexity (getting your CA's to act properly can be tricky, I recommend
 borrowing chi's macros :-).



 Alternate plan 1:
 What follows is a somewhat more complicated plan, it requires some
 additional coordination.  Also, you need 3 good SC players.  In the
 basic strategy, there were jobs for CA's, and SC's just bombed.  For the
 most part, the CA roles are the same, but the SC's get a bit more
 complicated.
   SC roles:
         asw:  either mutual with, scum, or drive out enemy SC bombers.
         bomb: obvious.
         take: if they scum a SC bomber.
    
   My personal favorite plan involves 3 SC players that operate as
   follows:
         upon entering the game
             if there are no SC's in enemy space  
                 Go there NOW (always have a bomber)
             if there is a SC bomber in your space
                 Attempt to scum him, failing that mutual.  Failing that
                 run the SC bomber towards their space, failing that
                 run him into 3rd space.  As soon as you reach the edge
                 of 3rd space break off pursuit and go bomb (again, try
                 to angle them towards their space).      

         if you get a kill  
             if you're in your backfield:  pickup
             if you're in their backfield and there is another SC in
             their space, consider returning to pickup.

         if you are the only SC in enemy space
             bomb passively
                 Don't fight over armies, be inconspicuous (don't plink
                 them when they reenter, etc.)
                 REALLY try to avoid dying

         if there are multiple bombers in enemy space you can be more  
         agressive about going for armies or double ogging someone.

 It sounds like a lot of rules, but they're fairly intuitive.  The major
 drawback is that you need 3 SC's who can at least do a passable job asw,
 bombing, and dropping armies; not many teams have this capability.

 This leaves 5 other people, I can't suggest what you should do with your
 base since this depends very heavily on how good they are at ogging,
 etc.  If your base is back in core, ideally your SC people should be the
 ones using the armies stored there (since they are picking up kills in
 the backfield) and your CA's shouldn't have to fly all the way back.

 Alternate plan 2:
 This is a continuation from the Red Shirt plan (above), and is useful if
 you have a strong base who can survive (with a lot of help) at the
 front.  Basically, a CA at the front guards your core armies, and your
 SB moves to the front.  This has the advantage that your ship with all
 the firepower actually gets to fight, and the ship that is a deterrent
 to SC bombers (since it can take planets if they give up a kill) is
 guarding the armies.

 With this plan you have 1 SC bomber, 1 SB at the front, 2 ASW people,
 and 4 people flying CA's at the front.  The SC bomber should be passive
 (since if he dies there is no bomber until he returns).  The 4 CA's at
 the front need to be a bit more flexible about helping with the bombing
 than they were under the prior 2 plans (instead of just bombing the
 front they may have to go to the side planets or even core).

 The ASW people require some extra explanation.  These two players will
 have to coordinate with each other a LOT.  Their job is to create an
 army pile on some convenient planet.  The planet having fuel is almost a
 requirement, being AGRI or "frontcourt" core is nice too.  If nothing
 good is around the homeworld will do.  I'll break their jobs up by
 cases:
         1 ASW has a kill, other does not
                 ASW with kill should either take planets, or ferry
                 to the stockpile.  ASW without kill guards stockpile.
         neither ASW have kills
                 1 ASW tries to guard core armies and scum enemy SC bombers
                 other ASW goes to front and acts as normal CA.
         both ASW have kills
                 one should take planets while other ferries armies.

 The ASW should probably be in CA's or SC's depending on the situation
 (if you want to guard armies the CA is better, if you want to run down
 their bomber obviously the SC is the ship of choice).

 Also, just because you have no base doesn't mean this plan won't work.
 Just stick the base player in a CA and add him to the four people
 already at the front line.

 In addition to allowing you to use your base's firepower, this plan lets
 your team know whose job it is to deal with the SC bombers.  A lot of
 teams have the problem that their players like to chase SC's, or are
 hesitant to fly away from a planet with armies since it may be bombed.
 This way you know that someone on your team is considering this, and
 unless you get a message from an ASW person telling you other- wise, it
 isn't your job.



 @{fg fill}Communication:@{fg text}

 In general, the basic strategy requires little communication.  The follow-
 ing set of macros should suffice:

 mac.3.T  :%p++ @ %L
 eg.  "5++ @ REG"
 Pretty obvious.

 mac.p.T  :ESCORT!  %a armies to %L @ %n.  Currently at %B in a %S
 eg. "ESCORT!  4 armies to CAP @ 5.  Currently at EAR in a CA"
 Fairly good distress macro, if you have any improvements let me know.

 mac.%.T  :%L @ %n
 eg.  "IND @ 1"
 I suggest only using this for weakend planets, not planet pops.

 mac.k.T  :HELP ME AT %B, %f%% fuel!
 eg.  "HELP ME AT CAN,  38% fuel!"

 To communicate more quickly, I recomend you map 3 of these macros to
 your mouse buttons.  That way to send the message all you do is hit
 "macro" then a mousebutton.  The fourth macro should be bound to your
 macro key, so all you hit is "macro" "macro" to send it.

 The 3 SC plan will require your 3 SC players to utilize the galactic map
 a LOT (the Bagels have pretty good SC players, and it took us 2 or 3
 practice games and a LOT of yelling^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hhelpful suggestions to
 get it right).

 For the Red Shirt plan, the two ASW people will have to do a bit of
 messaging to let the other one know who is taking, who is ferrying, etc.
 For this role, you'll want two people who can handle this.  And WILL
 handle it, this is one job where you can't go off and do your own thing,
 cooperation is essential.



 @{fg fill}General comments:@{fg text}

 A lot of these skills you can easily practice in pickup play.  Space
 controlling is pretty easy, so is performing the SC jobs.  There's no
 reason they won't work in normal pickup play (the ASW and SB roles are
 about the only ones not possible to practice in pickup play).

 Space controllers shouldn't spend a lot of time cloaking.  It burns
 fuel, and your teamates don't know who you are either (assuming the
 enemy is fooled).  Think about it, you tend to treat cloakers as hostile
 until you know otherwise, so the only people you're confusing are your
 teamates.

 Be flexible.  Last season the Bagels used the 3 SC plan until we either
 gained or lost our front line, then we switched over to the Red Shirt
 plan.  You may want to have a contingency plan setup, but I'd rather
 have a team understand one plan well, than two plans poorly.

 If you gain your opponents front line, move your team (and asw UP) and
 use the armies from the middle 6 planets to fuel your advance.

 If you lose your front line, don't have 2 SC bombers just bombing the
 enemy's back 7 planets.  You're now playing 6 on 8 and they still have 6
 planets they can pickup from.  In this case I suggest either using 1
 bomber, or if you use two, the SC's will have to be agressive about
 bombing the front.

 Unless you're being shot at (or shooting) STARE at the galactic, try to
 guess where your opponents are going and either tell your team, or head
 over yourself.  This is especially important with space control
 strategies.

 Subject: Exploding ships

 Um, I suggest those who really care about such things look at the source
 file ntserv/daemonII.c (get sources via anonymous ftp from
 scam.berkeley.edu).  The maximum damage an exploding DD/CA/BB/AS does is
 100 (all other ships with centers within one shield radius take maximum
 damage).  The exploding SC maximum is 75, and the exploding SB maximum
 is 200.

 For ships within 1 to about 8.5 shield radii away the damage falls off
 lineary from maximum to zero.  I'm not sure how big 8.5 shield radii is,
 but I'd say the bitmap for an SB explosion is about 4-6 radii.  The
 blast radius is the same for all ship classes.  And, just for your
 information, a SC is just as "big" as a BB as far as a torp is
 concerned, whether or not shields are up.

 The damage done by a ship explosion goes like this:

 - if the ship is within your shield radius, full damage (see above)

 - if the ship is outside your shield, but within SHIPDAMDIST (which
         is the same for all ships, about a third of the way to the
         edge of the tactical display) then damage is
         (full damage) * (SHIPDAMDIST - dist) / (SHIPDAMDIST - shieldradius)

 So, the "explosion damage range" is the same for all ships, it's just the
 damage for each ship type that varies.  Note that this is all in the
 standard distribution -- your mileage may vary, depending on server hacks.

 Subject: Xtrek Hints

 [ This time I am using ezmail at 2400.  At this baud rate, it's
 neo-retro.  I guess we dialup users are getting stranded by progress. ]

 This is a list of tips about game play.  They start with the ones I
 suspect the fewest know about, and move towards progressively more
 obvious ones.

 Long range (galactic) map
 =========================
 During Tmode, you show up on the enemy's galactic map if and only if you
 are within 1/3 of a galaxy width of any enemy ship.  If you are cloaked,
 the fraction goes down to 1/7th.  There is no way to know whether or not
 they can see you.  This feature was intended enhance the "fog of war,"
 but it basically screws teams that have all of its ships in one place.
 If you see the enemy team clustering around its starbase, exploit this
 feature to take planets.

 Note: if you orbit any planet that you do not own, you will be seen.

 Note: the status of your mappers (on/off) has no effect with respect to
 being seen.

 Conquering the galaxy
 =====================
 The game is over when a race has conquered 3 systems, that is, they
 own 10 out of 10 planets in 3 quadrants.  Note that the enemy can
 own all of its planets and still lose!  If one player distracts the
 robot (a nontrivial task under Tmode conditions), his teammates can
 snarf the robot's planets.

 This is a good strategy to use when you already own 2 systems and the
 enemy is stubbornly clinging to its last few planets.  That neutral
 quadrant probably already has several planets that don't belong to the
 robot.

 Robots
 ======
 A robot appears whenever you *bomb* a planet belonging to an
 unrepresented race and that planet is in that race's home quadrant.
 Suppose there are no Klingons, but there are Kli planets outside of Kli
 space.  These planets can be taken normally without creating Guardian.
 Note: you will be at war with Klis until you die, be careful lest
 someone else bring in Guardian.

 If Guardian is already there, he will not leave Kli space unless someone
 at war with him leads him out.  Kli planets outside of Kli space are
 pretty easy to get; again, you will be at war with the Klis until you
 die.

 [ Of course, "hostile" is reversible, "war" is not. ]

 Taking a planet from a robot-defended team gives you much less DI for
 the planet than usual.  Bombing robot-defended armies gives you normal
 DI, I think.

 Note that robots are not summoned when you beam down.  Of course, it's
 wasteful to beam down 58 armies for ONE planet, which leads us to....

 Plagues
 =======
 What prevents planets from accumulating 100+ armies?  Plagues.  Each
 planet has one every five minutes or so.  If there were N armies on the
 planet and there is a plague, the number is reduced to random number
 between 1 and N.

 If you are trying to snarf all of an undefended team's planets, this is
 how:  you should keep an eye on the army count of all of the planets.
 As you wait, some counts will drop below 10.  Beam down on these guys.

 Morality note:  Mucking about with neutral (robot-guarded) planets is
 way uncool unless you are trying to conquer the galaxy.  The more spread
 out the "planet contention zone" is, the more degenerate the game
 becomes.

 Planet takers
 =============
 Why should you go after planet takers?  Well, if not to protect your
 team's planets (a damn good reason by itself), there is an additional
 incentive for the self-centered:  You get bombing credit for 5 times the
 number of armies shot down.  Any AS carrying 10+ armies == 50+ armies
 bombed == a very juicy target.

 You can tell when you have killed somebody with armies because you are
 awarded 1.0 kills for the kill plus 10% of his kills (e.g., 0.3 kills if
 he had 3), plus 0.1 kills per army dusted.

 Cloaking
 ========
 DDs and ASs can lurk:  they can cloak indefinitely at warp 0 (shields
 off to improve regen rate).  Passive planet defense (orbiting and
 waiting for aggressors) loses because you cannot see where attackers are
 amassing, nor how many.

 Killing starbases
 =================
 A couple tips:  to suicide on it, use a BB or AS.  Attack the base in
 pairs, cloaking in and uncloaking simultaneously on opposite sides of
 the base.  If the base isn't well protected, at least one guy should be
 able to pummel the base (a load of torps, a couple 100+ pt phaser shots,
 and an exploding ship).
 Main concept:  the SB can attack only one ship at any given time.
 Having a third ship hover just out of the base's tractor range and
 spraying torps as a distraction improves the cloaker's odds of getting
 close.

 A well protected base is much harder to kill; it's better to exploit the
 clusteredness of the enemy as described earlier.

 The Shell Game
 ==============
 Does it seem like the enemy knows that you have armies before your
 teammates know?  Try waiting on beaming up until you think you're off of
 their galactic map.  Or get a teammate who has kills to orbit the same
 planet as you.  Then they have to guess who has the armies before I (uh,
 they) suicide you.

 Bombing
 =======
 Bombing the enemy might seem like a futile chore; in actuality bombing
 has a strong effect on the strategic flow of the game.  Best ships to
 use are AS (any time) and SC (planets with 10 or less armies).  The AS
 has a better than typical chance of bombing a planet down to less than
 4.  Use only AS to bomb when armies are REALLY scarce.

 Bomb before going after starbase -- there will be a lot of enemies with
 kills once the SB attack begins, and there will be less people defending
 planets as well.

 ==========
 Well, that should be enough for now.  Here endeth the lesson.

     Ok folks, a lot of people seem to be having a bit of trouble with
 this tractor/pressor concept, so as a solid veteran I'll hand out some
 clues....

 The following are Weapon Systems

 Phasers
 Photon Torpedoes
 Plasma Torpedoes
 Tractor Beams
 Pressor Beams

 Phasers
     A direct fire weapon.
     The Phaser will fire in whichever direction your mouse is.  If it
 comes close enough to an enemy ship it will lock on to it and follow it
 for the duration of the phaser pulse.
     The Phaser CAN lock on a cloaked ship.  This can be useful if you
 follow the beam lock-on you may be able to hit it several times
 consecutively.
     Phaser damage drops sharply with range.  This appears to be an
 almost inverse-squared ratio so pay attention to range when using
 phasers.  [ jch : it's a linear relationship on standard servers ]
     Damage:  Varies greatly.  Goes upwards from SC's to SB's.
     Fuel:  Ranges from ~550 for the SC to ~1100 for the BB.
     Heat:  Continous Phaser fire builds up weapon temp very quickly.
 SB's should be carefull of this.


 Photon Torpedoes
     A missile weapon.
     Photons fire in whichever direction your mouse is pointing.  Rapid
 fire bursts of torpedoes lose some of their acuracy due to spreading.
     Damage: SC-25 DD-30 CA-40 BB-40 AS-30 SB-30.  [ jch : corrected ]
     Fuel: Ranges from 200 to 350.
     Heat:  Torpedoes produce very little heat.  approx. 2 per torp.

 Plasma Torpedoes
     A homing missile weapon.
     This weapon can only be mounted on DD's, CA's, and BB's.  It comes
 as standard equipment on the SB.
     Plasmas always fire in the same direction your are facing.
 Exception: SB's may fire in any direction.
     To equip your ship with plasmas you must get 2+ kills and refit at
 your home planet or an SB.
     Plasmas may be targeted and detonated by phaser fire.
     Plasma homing systems are not very accurate but they WILL home in on
 a cloaked ship.
     Plasmas have a large area of effect.  Do not deteonate a Plasma next
 to your teammate if it might miss anyway, he will take serious damage.
     Damage:  100+ damage from a direct hit.
     Fuel:  3000 units.
     Heat:  Plasmas produce up to 30! heat per shot.  A starbase under
 heavy fire should NEVER use plasmas.


 Tractor/Pressor Beams
     Tractor/Pressor Beams are a direct fire weapon.
     T/P Beams lock on the ship closest to the mouse cursor.  If this
 ship is out of range they will not lock.
     T/P Beams will NOT lock on a cloaked ship.  They WILL retain lock if
 an already Tractored ship cloaks.
     In order to escape a Tractor Beam you must do better that warp 8.
     Warp 8 will evenly counter a Tractor.  Note that BB's and AS' cannot
 escape tractors.
     Damage:  None.
     Fuel:  Varies.
     Heat:  T/P Beams do not produce weapon heat.  They DO produce engine
 heat tho'.


 Hope this post help's those of you who needed a clue.  If you have any
 other questions, post 'em!

 Subject: More Weapons Foo...

      Ok folks, I just spent a couple hours testing the tractor/pressor
 systems on an independent server with a couple assistants.  Here is a
 list of my findings....

 1.  There is NO WAY to T/P beam a cloaked ship!  The weapon systems will
 not even recognize his existance!  If you seem to slow down as you are
 approching an SB then one of two things has happened.

             1.  He locked his pressors on BEFORE you cloaked.
                                           or
             2.  You've had too much to drink, go to bed.

 > 2.  There is no difference in T/P Beam strength from ship to ship.
 > Neither do the beams take into account the various ships mass.  If a
 > stationary BB Tbeams a stationary SC they will meet prescisely in the
 > center.  Thus the beams affect both ships equally.
 [ jch : the text marked with ">" is just plain wrong ]

 3.  Just as a little point of interest.  If a BB is chasing an SB at
 Warp 8 and the SB is running away at warp 2 and Pbeaming the BB.   The
 BB will only approach at about Warp 1!  Of course, the BB can try to
 counter this effect by Tbeaming the SB...  Though at that speed with
 tractors active, the BB will overheat less than 10 seconds.

 4.   Another point of interest.  If a SB is being Tbeamed by two ships
 and also moving at Warp 2, it can acheive an effective speed of warp 6.

 5.   I can't remember (I shouldn't be up this late, you see...), but I
 don't think the SB's T/Bbeams turned out to be any more powerful than
 anyone elses. (just much longer range.)

 6.   As a final note.  Breakaway speed to escape Tbeams is lower than I
 thought, (I forgot to take in the relative speed of the tractoring
 ship...) it is down around four or so,  but if the tractoring ship is
 chasing you as well, it effectively becomes MUCH higher.


     Any more comments or errors anyone may have spotted would be
 appreciated.

 Subject: Adjustments.
 Cc:

 A question for a.g.x. readers first:  Why the increase in suiciding?
 Just because it's easier/too easy?  Or is there a greater awareness of
 the value of this tactic?

 I think some adjustment in strategy is required.  First, the value of an
 escort in terms of deterring suiciders is high -- if you have a
 competent escort.  I haven't seen many planet takers asking for
 assistance... too macho to request help, I guess.  Second, whoever takes
 the planet can no longer stay around to guard it -- the enemy should be
 trying to ogg him.  This means other players have to prevent the freshly
 taken planet from being overrun.

 I've tried some new tactics that work well:
 1.  Non-Ogg:  Stay in a fairly quiet/neutral area and rack up kills.  I
 was consistently drawing 2 enemy oggers while doing this.

 2.  Army-Ogg:  Amble down in neutral space down to enemy space with a
 fast ship.  Keep the engines cool.  Then bomb.  This also draws
 aggressive players.  Ogg whoever rushes in to kill you (you need fuel
 for this).  This way you don't give away kills.

 3.  Anti-Ogg:  Play rescue.  Watch for teammates that just got a kill
 but are hurt.  Intercept would-be oggers/scavengers.  To be good at this
 you have to learn how to torp and phaser cloakers.

 4.  Planet-Moof:  Take a planet when they don't expect it.  After
 applying tactic #1 a couple times, enemies will tire of chasing you.
 Pretend to apply tactic #2 but while carrying armies.

 None of this require the help of teammates.  But if enemy suiciders are
 bogging the team down, working cooperatively may fix that.

 Subject: Re: Adjustments.

 First, I'll answer Drewski's question about SB's seeming to Pressure him.
 If the SBer is a competent person, he ( or she, since Eek's been SBing lately)
 will move directly away from the cloak. Not only does this force the cloaker
 to use up more fuel, but it also forces him to move faster ( and therefore
 dodge worse).  This tactic works very well when unescorted, which seems to
 happen quite a bit to me :-(, though it's more due to my aggressive style.
 Second, I'd like to welcome Cannonfodder to the ranks, so to speak.  And
 finally, I'll give my opinion on why Ogging is so prevelent now.  (I've
 found myself doing it ALOT).  The reason is that I do it is that it is VERY
 effective way to stop people from taking your planets.  I learned all this
 (maybe too well) from Terence, and Terence only.  It has drastically changed
 the course of many games, and anyone with kills myswell get used to it.
 I had noticed an increased in Ogging even before the new turn rates were put
 in.  It's just a coincidence that the new turn rates coincided with the
 increasedd realization of the effectiveness of Ogging.  NOTE:  I do not
 endorce Ogging of people without kills, or even with 1 kill unless you KNOW
 they are going to take a planet.  People who do this are the ones who can't
 dogfight worth shit.  If you have 2+ kills, yah better watch out, though :-).
 If anyone is to blame for this it would be Terence (sorry old chap), but he
 taught everyone that I know about the effectiveness of killing people with
 kills.  (Afterall, Steve came up with the name Og after Terence suicided on
 him while playing Orion "Og".)  Oh well, just my two cents worth.
 P.S.  Brian (Balinor) did you get Balinor from the Shannara books by Terry
       Brooks?  If so, do you remember who was the Swordmaster, ie. what his
       name was?  Was that Balinor?  Thanks

 did you LOCK on it? If you did, you automatically slow to warp 2 on close

 Date: Fri, 14 Jun 91 20:37:22 EDT
 From: Herbert.Enderton@MORIARTY.THEORY.CS.CMU.EDU

 Now that I've been playing for a few months, I thought I'd jot down
 some simple strategic ideas that I would tell a player who has learned
 the interface and how to shoot and dodge, but is still basically flying
 around aimlessly when not in combat.  My own playing style is of course
 reflected in these comments.  Perhaps some of you experienced players
 will care to add to or correct this list; there's probably a lot I
 don't know about the game still.

 Attack planet-takers.  Look at the player list to see which enemy
 players have kills.  Look at the galactic map to find one of these
 ships heading towards one of your planets.  Always keep an eye out for
 cloakers on the galactic map.  It's usually more important to kill
 enemy planet takers than to take planets yourself.

 Read your messages.  Split them up into separate windows.  Ideally you
 should notice right away when a new team or personal message appears.
 It's really fun when you have a couple of team players that can respond
 instantly to messages.

 When the enemy ship is more valuable than your own, close with it.  The
 usual result will be that you both blow up.  Valuable ships include
 those carrying armies, those with kills, those threatening to bomb
 (especially assault ships), and usually any ship a long way from home.

 Bomb.  This is easy, and very useful.  If there are lots of planets
 with 30+ armies, as in the start of a new game, use an assault ship.
 Usually the direct approach works fine: fly at maximum warp towards a
 planet that isn't heavily guarded, cloak, bomb, die, and repeat.  If
 you are heavily damaged, try to get killed by the planet.  Limping off
 to repair is a waste of time.  Later in the game, deep-bombing in a
 scout is fun.  It not only kills their armies, it distracts their
 ships.  If you can get two ships chasing you around, that's great.
 Just keep an eye on your fuel gauge.

 Use phasors.  Learn where the 30 point range is.  If your opponent is
 too good at dodging your torps, e.g. if you're a novice and he's an
 admiral, you can still hurt him by phasoring him and blowing up in his
 face, if he lets you get close enough.  Phasoring cloakers is great
 because it also tells you and your teammates exactly where the cloaker
 is.

 Beginners are often advised to fly battleships and cruisers, but I
 think scouts are the simplest to fly.  They have wimpy tractors,
 pressors, and phasors, so pretty much all you have to think about is
 dodging and torpedoing.  Scout torps do less damage but go faster (warp
 16 compared to cruiser torp's warp 12), and have a shorter range so you
 don't need to abort them when you miss.  But keep that fuel tank
 filled, so you can do enough damage when there's an assault ship you
 need to kill.

 Always join the side with fewer players.  Wait a few seconds before
 picking a team when you first join, because the numbers fluctuate when
 people die.

 The enemy is easiest to kill when he is coming towards you at high
 speed, so (a) give him a reason to chase you (e.g. bomb) or (b) figure
 out where he wants to go and get in his way.  Don't chase a ship
 without good reason.

 When you're ogging a starbase, try to time it so that you come out of
 cloak and start shooting from one side at the same time as one of your
 teammates appears from a different angle.  (This is hard.)

 The easiest planets to take are the ones the enemy has just taken.
 Often one kill (two armies) is enough.  Actually the easiest are the
 independent planets; if you see a "planet destroyed" message in your
 team message window but the planet is still in bold, it's independent
 (as you can verify with the `i' key).

 Things you can (and should) do while cloaked include bombing, beaming
 down armies, and detonating enemy torps.  If you're bombing or taking a
 planet, cloaking is crucial when there is an enemy ship nearby because
 it prevents him from tractoring you off the planet, and of course makes
 it harder for him to shoot you.

 Don't cloak when approaching or in orbit around one of your own planets
 without telling your teammates; they might think you're an enemy and
 drop everything to come waste fuel on you.

 Set "update galactic map frequently" so you can pinpoint cloakers.

 Flying around behind the enemy lines is an excellent way to create
 chaos.  This will allow your teammates to bomb and take planets more
 easily.  Even if you don't have kills, if you cloak and approach an
 enemy planet you can often draw their best defenders to you.

 Fly at maximum warp when there's somewhere you want to get to (and
 there almost always should be).  In general, don't waste time; if you
 dawdle your team is effectively playing at a man disadvantage.

 Pick your targets, especially if you have a fast ship.  Don't just fly
 around looking for a fight.  If you engage a ship that is a threat to
 your team, you can be satisfied even if all you do is damage it or slow
 it down long enough for reinforcements to arrive.

 Some players (like me) send a distress call when they are engaging
 an enemy planet taker and need help killing it.  If you see a distress
 call from a player with no armies, that might be the reason.

 Two features of netrek that I just learned this last week, after months
 playing the game:

 (1) If you detonate the enemy's torps, they won't hurt your teammates at all.
 Useful to know when you're escorting a planet-taker.  The explosions
 will hurt you, of course. They also seem to hurt your enemies (other than
 the guy who fired them?).

 (2) If you lock on to a player and then he cloaks, you stay locked on.
 This can be useful if you're moving very slowly (say you're just trying to
 defend a planet) and he tries to fly circles around you.  You turn
 with him, tracking much better than you can possibly do by looking at
 the ?? on the galactic map.  Phasor straight forward and you've got him.

 (I learned #1 from Val Ckurai.  #2 is my own (re?) discovery.)

 Ah, but good players know to use pressors in that situation!  Just 
 push against someone on the opposite side of the planet--you go
 whizzing in opposite directions, and the torps slide harmlessly

 Subject: Flags

 Hi Everyone,

 Well, people don't seem to mention that warning flags are very useful in many
 areas of netrek.  Now, what are the flags you say?  Well, they are the G, Y,
 and R symbols under the heading 'Flags'.  On the tactical, it comes in
 different designs of the border.

 The G (Green) flag has the white border and signals that there are no enemies
 in or just around your tactical.

 The Y (Yellow) flag has the gray border is a warning that an enemy is near or
 just on the border of your tactical.  The R (Red) flag is the danger flag has
 the white dashed border, (the only exception to this is when you enter the
 game in a new ship where the border is dashed white but the flag is green
 things return normal as soon as the yellow flag comes up), this flag tells you
 that there is an enemy in your tactical close enough to attack you.

 Now, how are these flags useful?

 Well, the flags can he used in all parts of the game. 

 Planet taking: When in any ship, you gain fuel or lose less fuel uncloaked
 then cloaked. So since cloaking is really mostly only effective in the
 tactical, you come in towards a planet that has enemies, you then would look
 at your border and then start cloaking as SOON as it turns Grey (Yellow Flag).
 So that's why Andrew has the name Grey Elf :-)..  Now if you take an
 undefended planet take it uncloaked which saves you fuel (Unless you are a DD
 or a AS, then it doesn't matter).  If you are a planet taker you are a
 DEFINITE ogg target.  So to help then you suddenly see the Dashed borders (Red
 flag) come up. You are being ogged and just cloak and run.

 Bombing: Bombing in the beginning of the game is crucial to the game and
 bombing as many planets in one trip is important.  So the flags are a great
 way to approaching a planet to be bombed.  There are times I would of been
 able to bomb another planet if I had the fuel to cloak onto the planet instead
 of being exposed a killed instantly.  Bomb the planet uncloaked in the white
 border (Green flag) and then cloak if the border changes the enemy might pass
 without noticing. Now with the fuel you have and hopefully not too damaged
 ship you go bomb the next planet. When I am highly damaged bombing I always
 try to kill an enemy nearby so I don't give up kills and I take someone with
 me.

 Ogging: Ahh the art of ogging. Maybe Terence would write (the Exxon Valdez
 Guide to Ogging)?  Anyway, I use the flags when ogging too.. I pinpoint my
 target and go in at the highest warp possible without losing fuel (Warp 6 on a
 CA). I then look at my borders and cloak right when it changes to grey (Yellow
 flag).  I then have a good amount of fuel to tractor, phaser, torp...
 KABOOM!!! Sound familiar guys? :-) :-)....

 Starbasing: Very helpful in that I am usually always in repair mode in the
 White border (Green Flag) the reason I am in repair mode is that an SB usually
 doesn't have a destination to go to so repairing is helpful for survival.  The
 Yellow and Red flags are helpful in getting your attention and getting enemy
 oggers.  Also you can save a few heart attacks and Wtemp when you check to see
 that there is a cloaker near you and the green flag is up signifying a
 teammate.

 That's about it.

 I hope this is somewhat useful.

 [ Tue, 12 Jan 93.  Scott asked me to add the following disclaimer to the
   archive record of his article:

   nb:  i wrote this a long time ago.  i still believe that the DD is
   the best "all-purpose" ship, but i never play one myself.  the
   reason is that though it is very flexible, it is best at none of the
   *fundamental* tasks at hand (bombing, ogging, taking).  today, i
   play a scout almost exclusively.
 ]

 ships:

 I usually play a DD because I think they are the best all-purpose
 ship.  On a moment's notice, you can do anything: ogg, deep bomb, take
 planets, or defend planets.  I think scouts are certainly superior for
 deep bombing, AS for initial bombing and defended planets, CA for
 getting kills (or playing in the 3rd race's space), and BB for point
 defense.  I find their only big disadvantage is lack of fuel.  You
 also have to be more careful about overheating your engines than you
 would in any other ship, but you should almost always be able to avoid
 this.

 Sometimes I'll play a SC even though i'm not bombing because the enemy
 is doing a good job of bombing, and i want to get to the armies before
 they do.  I'll play a BB when I'm frustrated, and feel like frying
 those enemy foolish enough to stray into my space.

 i'm going to post my usual "state machine" as i understand it.  i
 invite criticism and comments.


 opening moves (still planets with 25+ armies)
 =============================================

 1) in AS, bomb bomb bomb.  goto 1.

 interrupts:  if i am near an enemy bomber, kill it, but don't spend
 more than 5 or so seconds.

 if there are only 1 or 2 planets with 25+ armies, and i have teammates
 who appear to be taking care of them, and i have 2 kills, then
 commence mid-game play.


 mid game (everything between opening and end-game)
 ==================================================

 1) in a DD, ogg enemies with 2 (sometimes even 1) or more kills.
 repeat until there are none, or my team has lots of spare armies.
 goto 2.

 2) still in DD, get a kill.  if there are any "weak" (3 or less
 armies) enemy planets, get armies and try to take it.  If not, get
 another kill, then start taking planets.  keep taking planets until i
 die.  goto 1.

 interrupts:  if i appear at the home world in either SC or DD, and
 there is a bomber, go kill it.

 if there is a front-line agri that needs defense, do that until it
 pops. 

 if someone needs help taking a planet, do that, unless i'm trying to
 take planets myself.

 note: if the enemy has more planets than we do, spend more time
 ogging.


 their end game (enemy has only core planets or less)
 ====================================================

 1) in an AS, get a kill or 2.  goto 2.

 2) get armies, get help, bribe tc2i (a doughnut usu works), take
 a planet.  goto 1.

 interrupts:

 if teammate requests escort, do that unless also carrying or about to
 carry.  then suggest coordination.

 if they have a planet that can be bombed, do that.

 if any enemy carries, ogg (use DD or CA).


 our end game (we have only core planets or less)
 ================================================

 (3 or fewer planets) in a BB, guard a planet.  leave armies on the
 planet.

 (4 or 5 planets) ogg everything.

 your life has very little value.  spend it freely.

         There are a lot of levels of clue.  The most clueless players phasor
 empty space, shoot at teamates, don't notice cloakers, and frequently
 fly as wierd speeds for no reason.  They are normally found at the home
 planet, drifting.
         Slightly less clueless players, don't read team bboards, die with lots
 of armies all the time, tractor the SB off of repair planets, and give
 away free kills by flying to the front and diing.  They are often seen
 near the front.
         Those with a clue, do well in dogfights, take planets when there are
 lots of armies, and often hang arround the SB to get kills or use it's
 firepower.  They often read messages, and will even follow advice.
         They good players constantly read messages, and watch the galactice
 map.  They Ogg when they are told about a carrier, and take the right
 planet at the right time.  They eventually make Admiral.
         The hotshots know who is carrying on the other team, read and write
 team messages, bomb when they have nothing else to do, change speeds all
 the time when dogfighting, protect planets, Ogg Oggers, leave crippled
 ships for team-mates, and RUN everywhere.  They need to go their

 Well, with all the complaining about net lag, I want to say one thing,
 net lag does not necessarily make you play badly. I've been playing
 with netlag (uphill, in the snow) most of my xtrek career, from
 reed.edu over to bronco. 300 ms ping time, 10% packet loss, and you
 have to go through about 4 hops of the NSFnet backbone from hell.
 We're a 56k baud link, so when someone at reed does an ftp or news
 comes in via nntp, I lose. I usually play at 3 updates a second,
 generally actually *get* 2, with some stretches of nothing.  I
 honestly can't think of much worse lag in North America. Even so, I
 still made commander on bronco, and I like to think I generally help
 my team. 

 The major thing lag will do to you is make it hard to dogfight. My
 win/loss ratio is terrible - .8 or so. I finally realized that there's
 almost no point in trying to dodge. When I think to I'll just do
 random direction changes hoping to make it harder for my opponent to
 aim. I also only fly battleships, for which dodging isn't crucial.
 Tractor, phasertorptorptorptorp BOOM. *If* you get the updates in 
 that are necessary to fire those four torps.

 The other thing you won't be able to do effectively with lag is take
 planets that are guarded. Planet taking is largely an issue of
 dodging, of knowing to sit right out of orbit until the dolts
 defending it shoot all their torps. You don't have that option with
 lag, as you can't move nimbly. Most of the time you end up dying with
 5+ armies.

 But there are many things you *can* do. Flying escort for teammates is
 relatively easy. The main point there is to be in the way of the torps
 and take out the attacker. Not hard to do with lag. Defense of an area
 of space or a planet is sort of easy, too. The key is to drive
 your opponents off and/or distract them long enough for someone else
 to kill them. Again, you don't need great net connections to do it.

 I've recently started playing on bezier (where I made Captain! Yay!
 Don't think I'll go any higher though, I just wont scum the DI) where
 the ping time is about 150ms, and I don't have to go too far into the
 NSFnet. I must admit to enjoying playing there more. The clue level is
 lower, but being able to actually fly ASs and SCs is fun.

 Surprise, surprise, there *is* a 2xDI bonus for home worlds, and an
 extra planet bonus for the genocide planet (which makes 3xDI).

 I think the DI system is necessarily flawed.  There have been a number
 of attempts to reform it, and all have failed (except in adding a few
 minor perks like 5 armies bombing credit per army when you kill someone
 carrying).  I think this is not a coincidence; the DI system works
 well enough as it is.  No, it's not perfect, but there will always

 Subject: Games for non-t-mode
 Date: Tue, 19 Nov 91 20:15:29 GMT

 Games to play when it's not "t mode"

 (1) One-on-one dogfights.  The main problem is that runner-scumming gives
 one a huge tactical advantage, so this leads to insults and arguments.
 Another problem is with third parties interfering.

 (2) N on M fights, i.e. unstructured fly around shooting at the other
 team, playing for ratio or bragging rights or something.  This has the
 same problem with runner scumming.  There's also sometimes a problem
 with peace declarations.  Generally if the action is in Fed space, it's
 more fun if the Feds are declared hostile to everybody, so everyone can
 fuel at their planets.

 (3) Two on one fights, where the one is "allowed" to run.  I.e. the
 one player is content just to live, and the two have to work together
 to trap and kill him.  This can be kind of fun.

 (4) Starbase ogging.  Get four people on one side so somebody can
 check out the starbase, then everybody switches to another team to og
 it.  Well, maybe one escort stays behind.  The base should move far
 enough forward that it is in serious danger.

 (5) King of the Hill.  This is my personal favorite.  Designate some
 fuel planet near the center as "the hill", and whoever is closest to it
 at a given time is King (or Queen).  We had a really fun King of El
 Nath game on bronco last week.  If too many people declare peace with
 each other it gets kind of lame.  The owner of the planet should not be
 at peace with any other race because everybody is going to want to be
 able to refuel there.  Other than that, anything goes:  cloaking,
 runner-scumming, starbases, whatever.  It's also fun just one-on-one.

 (6) Push 'em back, push 'em back, waaaaay back.  Two teams.  Where
 the "front" is indicates who is winning.  This makes the most sense
 if everybody stays kind of near the line between the two home planets,
 and is kind of ill-defined when there are players behind the enemyf
 front lines.

 (7) "Planet-taker" versus defender.  One version for two players:
 designate two adjacent planets as targets.  The planet-taker wins
 by orbiting either of them for three seconds.  The defender wins
 by killing the planet taker (even if the defender is also killed).
 I haven't really play-tested this one.  Depending on the players it
 might be fun with just one target planet.  Could be fun with more
 players too.

 (8) Border patrol.  Imagine a line between two adjacent planets.
 One player wins just by crossing the line and surviving.  The defender
 tries to stop this.  I haven't play-tested this at all, maybe it's lame.

 (9) "Puck".  I forget who came up with this idea, I think somebody on
 the Pitt server.  Set up a dummy player named Puck (in a scout perhaps)
 at peace with everybody.  Everybody declares peace with Puck.  The goal
 is to tow Puck to your home planet.  In the one game I played on
 bronco, Puck often died from nearby explosions.

 (10) Robot-bashing.  Bomb just to create a Guardian robot, and then
 kill it.  Or take a planet on bronco or rwd4 to generate Terminators
 and kill those.

 (11) Ogger versus survivor.  A one-on-one "dogfight" where the ogger
 wins by killing (mutual destruction is satisfactory), and the survivor
 just by living, i.e. he runner-scums.  It might make sense to limit
 the area that the survivor is allowed to roam in, or to give the
 survivor a goal of touching some planets.

 Subject:  How to avoid hurting your own team in last planet stands
 Date: Thu, 28 Nov 91 22:09:17 GMT

 Recently I've been on some bad teams that got reduced to their last couple of
 planets and on some of these occassions we've been genocided despite my
 efforts.  I've noticed my teammates doing some things which I think are
 worse than useless, mistakes that actually hurt our team more than playing
 down a player would.

 (1) Cloaking near our planets.  I can only sometimes figure out which
 cloakers are enemies and which are on our team.  Cloaked ogging is certainly
 an important tactic for the defender, and if you're moving away from Earth at
 high speed I can safely assume you're on our side, but be careful.  Somtimes
 someone on my team will go to pick up armies while cloaked, and they look
 exactly like a bomber when they do this.

 (2) Orbiting our planets too much.  I certainly want my team to be near
 our planets, and the orbit-a-fuel-planet-and-fire-constantly technique is
 useful, but be careful, because a crowd of Feds on Earth (say) is very
 vulnerable to chain-reaction explosions.  And two is a crowd.  If you are in
 a crowd, have the common decency to detonate any torpedos that you can't
dodge.
 There have been times when I've been unable to orbit a planet to pick up or
 put down armies simply because there's a teammate orbiting the planet,
 getting hit by torpedos and threatening to explode.  The other problem with
 crowding around a planet is it obscures any enemy cloakers that manage to get
 on the planet.

 (3) Stealing armies.  It's incredibly aggravating when somebody picks up
 the only army or armies your team has, doesn't pay attention to messages
 saying to bring it back, and dies with it or wastes it on a planet you can't
 take.  The hard-won profit of all your careful guarding can be thrown away by
 one stupid player.

 (4) Bombing planets we ask not to bomb except in an assault ship.  An assault
 ship has a chance (20% or so) of bombing a planet to just 1 army.  If your
 team has just 2 free armies available, by trying an assault ship bomb on each
 of the planets you're interested in taking, there's hope of taking one.
 Sometimes you have to wait for the planet you want to pop before you have any
 chance of taking it.  Unfortunately I don't think I've been on a team bad
 enough to get reduced to 1 or 2 planets but good enough to read their team
 messages and forbear bombing those enticing enemy-owned core planets.  Even
 more than #3 this is a case where one bad player can ruin a team's chances.

 (5) Giving away kills.  This is always a problem, but can be especially
 pronounced when the good fighters are hanging back defending the planets and
 the bad ones are blithely flying into streams of torpedos.

 (6) Arguing with teammates and getting them upset.  I'm certainly guilty of
 this much of the time.  When I start to lose, and my teammates start doing
 stupid things such as the ones on this list, I get upset, tell them to "stop
 doing X", and then they either ignore me, question why, argue with me, or
 reply with abusive messages, any of which makes me more upset.  It's
 difficult to play well while angry or upset, and impossible to play well
 while typing messages.

 (7) Sometimes I count on somebody to do the obvious thing, and they don't.
 Like there might be two players staying near a planet, and I assume that
 they'll shoot at the incoming cloaker, so I do something else.

 Now if you want to actually be helpful, not merely avoid being harmful,
 the main things are to dodge torpedos and to shoot nearby enemies, especially
 cloakers.  Beyond that, there are lots of useful roles, e.g. ogger,
 defender of one planet, scout deep-bomber, assault ship nearby-planet bomber,
 space control fighter, planet taker, and flexible respond-where-needed
 defender.

 Sorry if this all sounds critical and negative.  Most likely the readers
 of this newsgroup aren't likely to make these mistakes too often anyway.
 I'm mainly posting this by way of explaining why I get upset and send
 nasty messages during the game sometimes, something that I really should
 never do.

 Suppose we're down to two planets and I send a message saying "don't bomb
 Earth" (because I plan to assault-ship bomb it and hope to take it with
 just two armies).  I implied in a previous message that I'd get annoyed
 when this suggestion is ignored, questioned, argued over, or rejected.
 A couple of people have sent me mail pointing out that I really shouldn't
 get upset if someone asks "why?".  And I agree, I shouldn't.  And usually
 I don't, although I'm usually in a pretty foul mood if I and my team have
 screwed up badly enough to be down to two planets.  On the other hand,
 I may choose not to take the time to explain my reasons during the game,
 because in my experience this takes a few minutes, and if I and the person
 I'm explaining it to are typing messages for a few minutes we'll probably
 get genocided.  So I apologize to all the people whose messages I brush
 off.  The other thing that I should have mentioned is what type of
 response DOESN'T annoy me (other than "ok").  "I disagree, we can discuss
 it later" is fine.  Or in the case where I might ask you to do X,
 "I don't want to do X, I'm doing Y" is a fine response.  E.g. "Sorry,
 I don't want to bomb, I just want to fly around blowing people up."
 That's a sentiment I can understand.  "Chill out, Bert, your messages are
 getting on my nerves" seems like a useful message to send too.  And
 "Why?" is fine.

 While I'm on the subject of messages, I'll explain some of the abbreviations
 I use.

 "2" means R2 is an important target, usually because he carries armies.
 (Note that in this case I'm likely ogging R2 myself, so MAYBE you needn't
worry).

 "get 2" means R2 is an important target, and I'm not killing him myself.
 Exclamation marks indicate urgency and/or frustration.

 "2 has 5" means R2 has at least 5 armies.  I also use "R2+5".

 "R2++" means (I think) that R2 just picked up armies.

 "R2 reg" means R2 appears to be going for Regulus, carrying armies.

 "reg" means I think someone is about to attack Regulus, so go defend it.

 "trying dra" means I'm going to try to take Draconis.  It doesn't necessarily
 mean that I want escort.

 "clear hyd" means please kill the enemies guarding Hydrae, so I can take it.

 A single distress call is just for your information, usually to let you know
 that I have armies.  Multiple distress calls mean "come quickly, I need
 help", usually because I'm out of fuel.

 "W" or "E" means I have weapon or engine burnout.

 Any other good abbreviations we should know about?

 Subject: Re: Questions, questions.
 Date: Fri, 13 Dec 91 21:13:06 GMT

 Some minor corrections and additions to the information about detonating
 other's torpedos:

 All ships have the same detonate radius, 1600.  That's twice the orbit
 radius.  Torpedos that explode by hitting somebody do damage to everybody
 nearby except the person that fired them.  Torpedos detonated by someone
 explode doing damage to everyone except the firer and teammates of the
 detter.  (I just made those words up, hope you don't mind.)  The damage
 from a torpedo ranges linearly from full damage when it's at 350 or closer
 (that's approximately your shield radius?) down to 0 at 2000.  So if you
 detonate a torpedo at maximum range (1600) it does 24.2% damage.  Pressing
 the det key costs 100 fuel and weapon temperature 2, even if there is
 nothing to det.  So don't hold it down.

 Detonating other's torpedos has gained popularity and is now considered
 a very important tactic.  When I first started playing, the old-timers told
 me that detting was almost always a bad idea.  In fact there's a comment
 in the source code that says "Experienced players never detonate other
 player's torps."  It's definitely tricky to use well.  My favorite uses
 are:  (1) to get the first torp or two in a stream (2) in a crowd, and
 (3) when taking a planet.  The trick is to make the snap decision to
 detonate or not, because if you wait until there are torps near you
 (like the ones you're just barely dodging), then you mustn't det.
 I also tend to detonate more SC and AS torps, because at warp 16 they're
 hard to dodge, and those ships don't have much fuel.  E.g. if I'm an AS
 beaming down armies on an enemy planet, and an enemy AS is firing at me,
 I can detonate all the torps his fuel tank gives him and live (barely),
 without even raising my shields.

      A *lot* of people believe this, but I've always considered this one
 of the great folklore stories of netrek. Actually, unless your SB is
 _waay_ far up, you can probably do just as well by joining in as the
 ship you want and flying at max warp to the base. I've found you really
 don't save that much time by doing the scout thing, unless you want a
 battleship. Plus, starting out with the ship you want gives you 3
 advantages:

 1)  If, along the way, you see something to do, you don't have to go all
 the way to your base to get your ship before doing whatever you want to
 do. I'm big on being prepared for anything at anytime. Notice that this
 opinion is colored by my known distaste for scouts, especially in
 offensive roles (I don't think scouts og very well).

 2)  You avoid the 6 seconds where you are a helpless grenade sitting on
 top of your base. Refitting on a base deep in enemy territory is a
 tricky and dangerous thing, and I'm not sure it's a good idea to do this
 when it's not necessary.

 3)  Very often, if your base is far enough forward to make the scout
 trick worthwhile, there's so much combat going on around the base that
 you may have to wait a minute or more before it's safe to dock on the
 base. In this case you would have been much better off just starting
 with the ship you wanted in the first place.

 I've tried this trick some, and I always found myself stuck in a scout
 wishing I'd taken my cruiser to start with. It might be worthwhile if
 you wanted a battleship, and the front was very far forward. But I've
 always found myself better off just taking either a cruiser or destroyer
 to the front at maxwarp, and then refitting if I found both opportunity
 and reason. For example, After getting kills I'll often hop on quickly
 and get my assault ship to go after a planet. But too often you just
 can't count on your base being available for refits at any time.

 Just my humble opinion,

 Subject: Team play with starbases
 Date: 3 Feb 92 14:05:11 GMT

 I have been borg basing it a bit on rwd4 lately, often against a
 remarkably lack of clue.  (151 kills == someone has no clue)  I have
 noticed both friendly and enemy play that reveals that people have not
 pondered enough what is going on.  Here are a few tips for people to
 use when playing with a starbase in the game.  

 First, a few tips for the enemy:

 o Don't ogg the enemy base without coordination

 The base is more powerful than you.  You will die.  And unless he is
 near to your home planet, he will be FULLY repaired before you get back
 to give him another kill.  UNLESS you coordinate with at least two
 other people on your team, forget it.


 o Avoid the enemy base, unless there is a reason not to.

 The way to kill bases is to lure them too far away from their home
 planet, then to ogg like crazy.  The way to lure them forward is
 simply to avoid them... you are faster than they are.  They cannot
 kill you unless you ask for it by going to them.  And there is almost
 always something better for you to be doing than trying to ogg bases.
 Scout bomb.  Take a planet that is just off the base's screen.  Ogg
 enemies with kills that are not lurking near the base.

 IMO, the only time you should go near an enemy base is to ogg it or an
 important enemy planet-taker (who admittedly are often found near
 bases...)


 Now some tips for my pals:

 o Use a base to free scout chasers

 As soon as a side is down to about two or three planets with the
 typical 30 or so armies on them after the initial bombing surge, it is
 time to enter a base.  Bases can pick up as many as 25 armies, and
 need no kills to do so.  Armies in a base are far safer than armies on
 planets, and do not need players constantly guarding them.  This frees
 up those players that would otherwise be fruitlessly chasing AS and
 scouts to do other things.  Thus, anytime your base has indicated he
 is more or less full of armies, do NOT bother to pursue scouts.  Get
 kills and take planets, content in the knowledge that with those
 scouts in your rear lines bombing the occasional army or two, you have
 a numerical advantage over the other enemy ships.


 o Use your base to conceal army movement

 Netrek is *not* a game about ships, but planets and armies.  Clueless
 and/or angry people may be content to dogfight aimlessly, but persons
 of clue only dogfight with a purpose, and they often do other things.
 They scout bomb, for one, which has been previously stressed on this
 newsgroup.  But they also watch enemy players beam up armies, and then
 announce that fact to their team, and then try to ogg the carrier.

 This trait is even more pronounced in a borg game; every pig borg, and
 also apparently all sunborgs have the capability to report to their
 rider exactly who has picked up armies and how many.  Regardless of
 whether you are cloaked or in range.  Therefore, you *will* be
 ogged...

 Unless you Use Your Starbase.  The server does NOT (to my knowledge)
 report the PF_BEAM flags for people beaming from/to bases.  And of
 course you cannot see the number of armies in an enemy base even with
 a borg.  Thus, it is usually far better to get your armies from a base
 than from a planet.  (Of course if the base is nowhere near a planet
 with armies, go ahead and grab them.)  There have been numerous
 occasions over the weekend where I have approached a planet with
 armies on it at the same time as one of my side's planet takers, only
 to have them take the armies and get ogged.

 Summary: don't make life easy for the enemy.  Get armies from your
 base preferentially.

 Also, a *real* useful thing to do when you have one kill and feel
 generous is ferry armies to your base.  Yet another positive action
 that earns no DI.  (People with 2+ kills should be taking planets.)
 Seems like a good tactic might to be to (obviously) pick up armies,
 drop them on your base, and then wait for oggers to come and give you
 additional kills.  (Use a BB for this.)


 o Use your base to refit/refuel/repair -- smartly

 Your base is exactly like your home planet -- you refuel, refit and
 repair much faster there than just sitting around.  (I believe that
 you actually repair there even faster than on a repair planet -- any
 gurus out there to confirm/deny this?)  So, when you are hurt or out
 of fuel, consider your base just as you might consider a planet.

 But remember: unlike a planet, a base can die.  Especially if you blow
 up on him/her.  Therefore, if battle is hot or looks to get hot
 nearby, do NOT dock.  Go somewhere else.  Flash if you need help; a
 base can help you even without docking; see below.


 o Your base can help you take planets -- even if you only have one kill

 Often people with one kill try to get a second before moving into
 planet-taking mode.  This is not always necessary -- if the planet you
 are targeting is next to your base and not to near the enemy
 homeworld.  Go to your base, possibly get into an AS, and quickly
 ferry armies from the base to the planet.  (Tell the base what you are
 doing, of course.)  The base can pressor you to the planet and tractor
 you back to speed the process... you can even take agris this way.

 Remember: to take a planet it is only necessary to get armies there
 faster than it pops.


 o Your base can save your ass

 Bases have big tractors and pressors.  Good bases use them.  Your base
 can sometimes pressor or tractor you out of the way of a torp stream.
 Be prepared for this.  Your base can also tractor you entirely out of
 a battle, if you are too injured to fly fast -- but this is unlikely
 unless he/she *knows* you are injured.  Signal to your base if you
 need help, by flashing your shields up and down three or five times.

 Bases can also det for you, since they can absorb lots of damage.
 (They take 600 internal, and have 500 shields.)  If the base values
 you, he may decide to tractor you in and protect you even in a pitched
 battle.  (Hint: I personally will do all sorts of things for my side's
 planet takers while basing.)

 A base is great cover to take a planet behind.  Or even near.  Enemies
 tend to avoid bases unless they are explicitly trying to attack them.


 o You can save your base's ass

 Bases will inevitably take a big ogg or two, often far from their home
 planet.  You will know this because (a) they will give a distress call
 showing substantial damage, and (b) the enemy will mass to try and
 annihilate them.  Now, if your base is carrying precious armies, or
 you need it for other reasons, try to help it live.  Here are some
 useful things to do.  Get between the oggers and the base, and try to
 kill them before they get there.  Or, put yourself in a position to
 tow the base.  (That is, about 1/2 screen away from the base in the
 direction of the home planet.  Be prepared to accelerate when you
 notice the pull of the tractor.)

 Or, get between the base and the oggers in a BB or AS (ideally) and
 det enemy torps that may hit the base.  This last tactic I have very
 rarely seen but it is ever so helpful to a base.  Kill-ratio?  I *am*
 talking about team play here...

 Subject: Attacking armies
 Date: Tue, 11 Feb 92 17:08:55 GMT

 Crack Pot's team demonstrated something to me in our CMU-league tourney
 game last Saturday, something that is perhaps obvious but which didn't
 crystallize as a strategic concept for me until after the game.  The idea
 is this:  one of the two easiest times to kill a planet-taker is when he's
 beaming up armies.  The other is of course when he's beaming them down.
 In both cases he's vulnerable because he's not moving, and because you
 know something about his location.

 In all the time I've been playing, defense has focused mainly on the
 beam-down phase -- we try to hustle over to get within shooting range of
 the planet we think he's going to try to take.  But Crack Pot's team,
 MUCUS PIG in particular, was very successful at attacking us at the
 beam-up point.  This strategy has some advantages over the more usual
 strategy of attacking at the beam-down point:

 (1) You know which planet or planets he might beam up from:  those with
 armies.  If Eri pops to 7, you (the Fed) can just go there, without even
 having to know who on their team might want to pick up armies.  (If nobody
 does, you might get to bomb, unless there's somebody waiting there to
 kill bombers.)

 (2) If he retreats from your attack, you get to eliminate the armies by
 bombing.  A planet-taker with armies just needs to stay alive; a
 planet-taker without armies has to think about protecting the armies on
 the planet as well.

 (3) Anybody on his team that comes to help is typically moving
 "backwards", i.e. away from the front.  E.g. if a Romulan needs escort
 just to pick up armies from Eri, that means there are two Romulan ships
 that aren't helping in terms of space control.  On the other hand a
 Romulan escort to clear Organia is doing the natural space control thing,
 namely fly south and blow people up.

 (4) There's a reasonable chance that someone going to pick up armies has
 just returned from battle (where he scummed his kills) and won't have much
 fuel.

 The disadvantage is that it's tough for the Feds to get ships all the
 way up to some place like Eri, without running out of fuel or getting
 crippled, while the Roms can get help there relatively quickly.

 I've left out two other ways to prevent the enemy from taking planets:
 scout bombing and mid-air ogging (i.e. ogging the carrier when he's en
 route).  Scout bombing is great, but against a really good team, most of
 the armies that pop get protected.  Good players look at the galactic map
 to see where the armies are, both theirs and the enemies, because in a
 high-level game this determines 90% of the game strategy.  There will
 always be someone going to bomb any planet of yours that pops, so it makes
 sense to go there to scum a kill off the bomber (and with luck, save the
 armies in the process).  Just look at the armies, and you can predict
 which way most good players will fly.  So to eliminate their armies you
 typically need to send some firepower to the planet, because your little
 cloaked scout is going to get blown away.  And if you can og a good
 carrier midway between Rom and Organia, when his team is escorting him,
 you're better than I.  That's got to be the hardest way of all to
 eliminate their armies.  (Not that I won't give it the old college try).

 I think the galaxy will be a more dangerous place for ships that want
 to pick up armies.

  -- Bert  (Red Shirt)

 P.S.  The one skill I pride myself on, besides dodging torpedos, is
 noticing instantly when planets pop.  I can usually lock onto a planet
 that pops and push the max-warp key within half a second of its popping.

                 Orders for sfop, as of 2-15-92

 I run the server on bezier.berkeley.edu, and I'm the author of sfop, the
 robot which often runs there on robot nights.  Since sfop is pretty single
 minded most of the time, and not much of a team player, I modified it so
 that players on its team can send it messages.  Here is the currently
 available list of commands:

         -  order patrol [planet]

            Causes the robot to patrol the named planet (you only need enough
            of the planet's name to uniquely identify it).  It will orbit the
            planet, attacking anyone who comes near, until it dies.  Then it
            reverts to hostility.

         -  order take

            Returns sfop to normal hostility (planet-taking in its own good
            time) mode.  This will override any of the previous commands.

         -  order take [planet]

            Overrides the standard planet-choosing algorithm.  If you notice
            that sfop is going to take a planet, and you're making a run at
            the enemy's home planet, you can order sfop to make a simultaneous
            attack (be aware that it may hesitate quite a bit before diving
in).
            Note that this command doesn't force sfop into planet-taking mode,
            but simple affects its choice of planet when it decides it's ready
            to take one.  Use the "order take" command to put it in planet-
            taking mode.

         -  order map [planet]  *or*
            order touch [planet]

            sfop will try to touch the named planet until your team has info
            on it, then it returns to hostility.

         -  order bomb [planet]

            sfop will try to bomb the named planet until it is down to 4 or
            less, then it returns to hostility.

         -  order escort [player] [planet]

            sfop will preceed the named player (either a unique part of the
            players name, or the player number), attacking enemies who come
            nearby, so that the player can take the specified planet.  Just
            as the planet comes on the edge of the escorted player's screen,
            sfop will run ahead and clear off the planet -- it's a good idea
            to slow down a little so you don't get caught in the crossfire.
            sfop returns to hostility when the planet is taken, or when the
            player dies.

         -  order ogg [player]

            sfop will do its best to hunt down the named player and kill
            him.  It'll keep trying until the person dies, even if it
            dies, so this is a good way to tell sfop to harass a starbase.
            When the player dies (whether or not sfop killed him), sfop
            returns to hostility.

         -  order report  *or*
            order r

            sfop will report its status.  This includes shields, damage,
            type of ship, and number of armies.  Most importantly, though,
            it tells you what sfop is doing.  If you're going to send an
            order to sfop, check his status first -- if it's doing anything
            besides "TAKING", assume that someone else on your team has
            already sent it an order.  Hopefully, this will cut down on
            tugs-of-war about what sfop should do next.

 Only players on the same team can send messages to sfop (others will
 be ignored).  Because there were about 4 people ordering it around one
 night, sfop now only takes orders from people with Commander rank (or
 above).  Also, sfop will tell you to try again later if it's currently
 doing something it considers important (like carrying armies).

 With all these functions, be patient.  It may seem to you that sfop is
 taking forever to ogg a player.  Don't re-order it to do so.  If you
 got the confirmation message the first time, sfop is working on it.  The
 only other possibility is that somebody else overrode your order.  If
 sfop is doing something too slow for your taste, do it yourself.

 Also, sfop now responds to the Industry Standard "     " messsage.
 Actually, it responds to any message which ends with five spaces, even
 if is has other text, because I'm lazy.  Sue me.

 I greatly appreciate comments and suggestions about this command facility.

 Subject: The value of assault ships in last planet stands
 Date: Tue, 25 Feb 92 02:10:18 GMT

 After a brief argument via the message window that certainly harmed my
 team tonight, I thought I'd explain a strategy I like for defending
 the last planet.  It's simple.  You take an assault ship and orbit the
 planet (which must have fuel), firing continuously at all nearby enemies
 (especially the cloakers), and detting any torps that will hit you.
 When no enemy is in range, you go into repair mode.  Why an assault ship?

 (1) With an adequate fuel supply, their torpedos are the BEST.  They go
 warp 16, do 30 points each, and have a longer range than any other ship's.
 (Yes, they go off the screen.  You can orbit Draconis and kill ships near
 Sirius; that's about where the torps peter out.)
 True, cruiser and battleship torps do 40 points each, but they're slower
 (warp 12), so if the same proportion of torpedos hit, all three ships
 deliver the same amount of torpedo-damage-per-second for any given distance.
 (Mulitply torp damage times speed).  And with warp 16 torps you can expect
 to hit more often.

 (2) When the planet pops, you want an assault ships to carry the armies, not
 only because it's the best ship for beaming down armies (if you det often
 while beaming down it will take a lot of torps to blow you up, even with
 no shields), but because it can bomb a planet from 5 armies to 1 or 2
 fairly often (40% chance).  Also with one kill you can pick up three armies,
 which is almost always enough to take a second planet.

 I'm not saying that everybody on the defending team should be an assault
 ship.  A BB with plasma, waiting an inch away from the planet and dodging
 slowly will be a more reliable planet-defender.  But you've got to have
 at least one assault ship on your team if you want to have much chance
 of retaking a second or third planet.

 The orbit-the-planet trick has a couple of dangers.  First of all, you can't
 dodge very well like that, so one good escort can easily take you out.
 Secondly, you might obscure an enemy cloaker, should you be careless enough
 to let one get by you.  But most importantly, unless you religiously
 detonate any torps that will hit you, you present a danger to any of your
 teammates who might want to orbit the planet.  Remember that any torps
 that hit you will damage everybody nearby (except the person that fired them).
 If you det them, they will not hurt your teammates at all, and won't hurt
 you nearly as much.  If you explode from detting so much, that will hurt
 your nearby teammates too, but it's not as nearly bad as letting torpedos
 explode on you.

 The other point I want to make about last planet stands is what to do
 when your planet pops.  Before it pops, it's reasonable to have some people
 out trying to ogg, some people bombing (preferably anybody too lagged or
 too unskilled to be able to shoot a cloaker), and just a couple reliable
 defenders back at the planet as goalkeepers.  But when it pops, everybody
 on the opposing team becomes a threat, not just those with a kill, and
 also you may need to control the space around the planet well enough that
 one of you can pick up the armies without getting ogged to death.  This
 typically requires the entire team to be there.  (I'm kind of assuming that
 a team in a last-planet stand is inferior to their attackers.)  And then
 you then want to bomb the nearby candidate-second-planets intelligently.
 So if you're out ogging and your planet pops to 6 or more, I recommend dying
 and coming back in to assault-ship-bomb candidate planets (or
non-assault-ship-bomb them to precisely 5), or else to intercept oggers
 and det torps in order to save your planet-taker.

 From: Thomas Omar Smith <ts2a+@andrew.cmu.edu>
 Subject: Re: The value of assault ships in last planet stands

 I'm underwhelmed by Red Shirts strategy.  Here's why.

 1) During  a last planet stand, the last thing you want is to have
 someone orbitting the planet in anything unless they are repairing or
 refueling.  The more people on a planet, the higher the odds of a chain
 reaction.  This means that one well timed ogg can often destroy 3 or 4
 defenders, making a planet grab much easier.  Having a ship that is
 regularly orbitting increases the odds of this.

 2) At extreme range, the dispersion of torpedos makes significant damage
 from an assault ship spread improbable.  At shorter range, a Battleship
 can do more damage and has much stronger tractors/pressors.  Since the
 main goal in most planetary defenses is to stop cloakers, the higher
 phaser damage from the battleship is far more significant than the
 assault ships faster torpedoes.

 3) A battleship or cruiser can leave the planet and fight if it has to
 far better than an assault ship.  This increases the odds of both
 personal and team survival when a cloaker does get through.

 4) A battleship with shields takes almost as much damage as an assault
 ship with shields, and takes it in shields longer.  Therefore, in a
 crunch the battleship can often get the armies off the planet more
 quickly and safely than an assault ship.

 5) An assault ship with kills is a much more likely target than a
 battleship with kills.  And if oggers are attacking, the battleship has
 much better odds of fending them off.  Again, this increases the armies
 chances for survival.

 6) While orbitting a planet, its difficult to place 8 torpedos into
 someone.  its easy to place 2 or 3 and have the rest det when the player
 starts detting.  The orbitting ship therefore is no safer.

 From the battles I've been in, its much better to put a few battleships
 near the planet and have them crush anything that gets remotely close
 while the rest of the team oggs enemies with kills and bombs.  This
 keeps the planet safe and keeps the enemy from having large numbers of
 people who can carry armies.  Once you reach that state, you can target
 the dangers and eliminate them until your planet pops.  Then have
 someone grab the armies while someone else in an assault ship clears a
 target.  And have everyone guard the ship with armies.

 Subject: Sun Tzu's Guide To Tourneys

 Greetings all,
   After hearing about the CMU 1 vs UPenn Tourney on Saturday, I figured a
 post was in order.  For all you captains out there, with the only
 exceptions MAYBE being Berkeley, I'd advise paying attention and asking
 questions to n.a.g.x before starting your tourneys.  I'm doing this
 solely so that CMU doesn't have a total walk to the finals.....no,
 that's not arrogance, they genocided Upenn in ~10 minutes yesterday with
 ping times of around ~30 for them.  This is by no means a reflection on
 UPenn's skill level, but rather their inexperience in Tourney
 settings....the same reason the CMU All-Stars were able to (with the
 help of horrendous lag for UCB) genocide Berkeley.  Ok, here goes....

 Initial 5 ~ 10 Minutes:
   The optimal (and currently popular strategy) is to have 7 Assault Ships
 and 1 SB.  As Roms, the SB picks 25 armies off Tau and then protects Rom
 and Drac.  As Feds, the SB picks off Alp or Alt depending on which is
 NOT agri (or if neither are, whichever he appears closest to).  The Fed
 SB then protects Earth and the other of {Alt, Alp}.  The current
 strategy that my team has been trying is to have 6 AS's, 1 BB and 1 SB. 
 The BB protects the two planets the SB will protect while the SB is
 picking armies off the 3rd planet.  This BB player has to be a good
 cloak phaser, and a good planet taker since he will usually get the
 first kills of the game.  
   For the bombing part, have your 6-7 bombers know what planet they are
 assigned to bomb.  An alternate method is to assign halves, and let the
 players use commen sense while bombing (ie.  If there is a cloak on
 Ceti, fly by and go bomb Beta).  There have been 2 tourneys where the
 enemy SB was killed before bombing began, but both of the teams that did
 that lost...you can use your own judgement on that one.

 Mid-Game:
   The team that does the best job of protecting it's own armies will
 usually win.  This includes preventing scout bombing AS WELL as
 escorting planet takers.  In this part of the game, the SB should
 continue to sit by Rom and Drac (using Romulan examples from now on) and
 NEVER move forward.  NO BASE CAN (ah, SHOULD) LIVE IN A TOURNEY SETTING
 EVEN REMOTELY NEAR THE FRONT LINE!!  If you move your base near the
 front line against a CMU team, I guarentee that it will die...no matter
 who it is.  Again, this is not arrogance but rather experience from
 blowing up Balton again and again in tourneys (and he's head and
 shoulders above the rest of us base players here at CMU.. like a 90
 ratio with over 100 SB deaths).  
   Each person should have a clearly defined role, and if unable to
 fulfill that role, be able to recieve help from the "freelancers". 
 Generally, each team will have 1-2 (2 being more popular today) full
 time scout bombers.  These bombers can also double as assistant oggers,
 which you should also have a few of.  Planet scum are necessary, as well
 as escorts.  NOTE:  Don't try to define roles too distictly....Netrek is
 a game that has to be played by the flow of the tide.......you need to
 be able to switch from one task to another at the spur of the moment.
   When people pick up armies they should ALWAYS announce it!  If they
 don't seriously consider kicking them off the team.............. (well,
 maybe just not letting them play the rest of the game if you have subs
 available).  The SB should just protect armies until it is completely
 out, at which point it should either sacrifice itself or simply turn the
 base in to get a real ship :).  A SB with no armies is a detriment to a
 team.....which brings us to the next topic...

 Ogging SB's:
   When the enemy continually has armies (due to bad scout bombing on your
 part), and you KNOW the SB is carrying it is generally time to ogg it. 
 YOU MUST TIME THIS RIGHT!  You don't want to use more than 2 waves to
 kill the SB, and you MUST watch enemy planet takers during this time. 
 You must also be able to judge your teams coordination and lethality to
 determine if they even have a chance to kill the base (this is location
 dependent, since a Romulan base at Romulus is a hard kill...but
 definitely not imposible).  Expect to lose at least 1-2 planets and fall
 behind in bombing while killing there base....you must be able to
 overcome this or ogging the base is the wrong tactic.
         
 End Game:
   When the timer gets down to 30 minutes left, you should consider
 hoarding armies on a base for a last push.  This is a tactic usually
 only used if your behind, but I've seen it down with even games and has
 turned the tide occasionally.  At this point it is VERY VERY important
 to escort your planet takers here. You should also consider stepping up
 the scout bombing to prevent the enemy's from accumulating them.  Even
 if you are down 3-4 planets at this point, as long as you are careful
 and protect your base, you have a chance of coming back.


 Notes:
   ALWAYS  hard kill planets if able.  It is much harder to stop two 1
 kill planet takers, then a single 2 kill planet taker.  

   If you have 1 kill ALWAYS carry armies...well, depending on how well
 you can survive.  If you don't pick up armies, they'll just get bombed
 anyways most likely.

   When against mega oggers, use scouts to drop armies 2 at a time.

 A few random comments, none of which is important:

 The opening is important; the first bombing wave often eliminates about
 150 armies per side, and this a significant fraction (perhaps 1/4) of all
 the armies that will ever exist in the game.  But I guess there are many
 good opening strategies other than the one Sun Tzu suggests.  I'd be kind
 of disappointed if everybody uses the same old defend-75-armies-with-the-base
 strategy.

 Some of the tricks that work in average pick-up games don't work in
 tourney games.  When everybody is good, you can't get free kills by picking
 on the ensigns.  Lobbing torpedos from a distance is usually a waste of fuel.
 Runner-scum dogfighters may find themselves completely ignored.  It gets
 harder to keep track of the key enemy players, because they're all key.
 And you'd better get a phaser on that cloaker if you want to have much
 chance of killing him.

 The pace of a tourney game is much faster.  Players are usually flying
 to some planet at maximum warp, whether to take it, bomb it, defend it,
 pick up armies, or even just to refuel (though some players prefer to die
 rather than take the time to refuel).  Planet takers will probably want
 to commandeer an escort or two, and this had better not take very much
 time to set up, because the planet that looks open now may not be open
 ten seconds from now, and anyway the planet taker may not live that long.

 Establishing roles for the players is helpful.  There's so much going on
 that it's hard to figure out where to fly, so I like pick one region of
 the galaxy to concentrate on.  But certainly one must be flexible, alert, 
 opportunistic, and sneaky.

 Be sure to show up early.  If the game is scheduled to begin at 9:00, it
 begins whether you have your full team there or not.

 Not true!  Detted torps do not hurt your teammates or the person who

 them.  One more reason to det when escorting planet takers...

 A few facts about the game which I didn't learn until recently:

 (1) If you tractor a ship which is docked to a starbase, it undocks.

 (2) You aim tractor beams by putting your mouse near the ship, not just
 pointing in the right direction as with phasers.  So you can reach over a
 ship to tractor one on the other side.

 (3) You can use tractors or pressors the instant you hit the key to uncloak,
 before you're able to fire.

 (4) A good time to declare war is after you are in orbit around a planet
 you want to bomb and have hit the bomb key.  That way you will bomb during
 the 10 second control lock-up.

 A fun way to use facts 1-3 is to ogg a ship docked to the far side of a
 starbase, tractoring it directly on top of the starbase as you uncloak
 and smash into both of them, detting their torps so they will damage each
 other.

 Regarding the advice to novices to deep-bomb in a scout all the time, I said
 the same thing last summer.  But I don't know, flying a fragile ship at high
 speed through traffic requires experience and fast reflexes, and also I'm not
 sure the novice will enjoy bombing a few armies as much as blowing ships
 up.  I guess I'd just advise people to fly whatever ship they want, but
 always go to planets with armies.  Too many people fly towards enemy ships;
 that's how to die.  Just go to the armies, whether it's their armies and
 you want to bomb, or your own armies if you have a kill or think you
 can get one by intercepting (not chasing!) a bomber.  And of course you
 should dodge torps, phaser lots, and shove torps at anybody that charges you.
 That's all you need to do to be a good player.

 Some basic ones:

 - Set the client to 2 or 1 updates/sec.  Yes, it's playable like this; try it
 on a local server to get used to it.  I never use anything faster than 3
 updates (mostly habit).

 - Inform your teammates that you're lagged.  Do not bitch and moan about it,
 it's not going to change things.  Quit out if your link becomes unplayable.

 - For TCP-only servers, occasionally ping it.  Look at packet loss rate and
 maximum response time.  Lost packets really hurt.

 - Play at weird hours of the day when the people in your time zone and the
 server's time zone who clog the network with legitimate traffice are asleep.

 - As a test, I hold down the torp key, and see how many torps come out on
 average in typical combat situations:

   8:    I connected to the local server by mistake
   6-7:  Quite playable, no adjustments necessary
   4-5:  A bit sticky.  Avoid close quarters combat and dense clusters of
         other ships.
   2-3:  Pretty bad.  I'll be doing newbie impersonations.
   1:    Haven't seen anything this bad.
   0:    Server is probably dead.

 >Do you actually lead with your phasers?

 If there's a consistent delay, yes.  Since phasers are direction sensitive,
 accuracy improves if the target stays at constant angle with respect to the
 phaserer -- such as when flying straight at the target or straight away --
 best done when phaser locked on a cloaker or when attacking a ship out of
 fuel.

 >When ogging, do you tend more to lock on to the enemy and go straight at him?

 This would improve the accuracy of torps and phasers, as long as the enemy
 doesn't dodge.  But ogging with lag is difficult -- you can't fire torps that
 fast, and as soon as too many torps are flying around onscreen your
 connection degrades.

 >How do you survive being ogged by a small fast ship driven by a non-lagged
 >enemy?

 Same as usual, except that nimbly sidestepping torp streams isn't as easy to
 do.  Pressoring, cloaking, detting, phasering, running -- stuff that doesn't
 require a rapid sequence of commands and/or rapid feedback.

 Yeah, I learned to play on remote servers.  The first to remember
 about lag is that you really don't *have* to play netrek... 'Q' is
 your little friend.  Play late at night and on weekends.  Or get a UDP
 client and play on bronco.

 If you feel you must play, know your limitations.  Stick to roles that
 allow you to avoid combat as much as possible.  If you are giving away
 kills right and left, you are a liability to your team.

 >Do you actually lead with your phasers?

 Yes!  This need not be a conscious thing, though.  It is the way you
 train yourself to fight.  Once we finally got harvey going here, I
 noticed that I was continually missing my phaser shots -- I was
 slightly leading all of them.

 Expect to miss most phaser shots, especially if you are at a
 reasonable range, as you ought to be.  There is no way to correct for
 unpredictable lag -- if you get a netburp at the wrong time, you
 miss, plain and simple.

 One trick I use when phasering lagged is to fly parallel to the enemy
 as I click for a phaser shot.  (More generally, move in such a way so
 that you maintain a constant relative direction.)  This way the phaser
 shot becomes less time critical.

 >Do you sometimes raise shields, detonate, and turn, without ever
 >seeing torpedos?

 Well, I raise my shields and turn, sure.  You need a *lot* more time
 to dodge shots, so you need to be further from an enemy than you
 normally would.  Close, spray, phaser, turn away, pray.  If the enemy
 does not fire, fine.  Otherwise, you will hopefully have obtained
 enough time by running to avoid most of the fire.  Also, if you do get
 crippled, you end up in a less dangerous position.

 I almost never det enemy torps when lagged, for a simple reason.
 Detting is *extremely* time-critical; that is, if your det request
 gets lagged for even a few tenths of a second, it will likely kill
 you because the torps are no longer in the 1/4 damage range but all
 around you instead.

 All you people who just got UDP clients or a local server should
 reconsider detting as a combat option.  It is really very useful.

 >What keys do you press when you've just gotten frozen?

 Shield up; turn away from the enemy.  Hit cruise speed or max warp.
 Then send a few zig-zag turns until it becomes plain that this is more
 than just a second or two, and you are either dead by now or
 completely out of danger.  Once this becomes true, I recommend having
 a read news process in another window... waiting for a ghostbust to
 end can be very frustrating.

 >When ogging, do you tend more to lock on to the enemy and go straight
 >at him?

 Ogging?  What's that?  :)

 A lagged player should generally not be ogging.  

 >Do you play different ships when lagged as opposed to local?  Why?

 I tend to play BB's and scouts more, CA's less, and never SB's.  (I
 never play DD's in any case; they suck.)  Scouts are the perfect ship
 for lagged players -- they are great at running away.  If you feel you
 must get into combat, you need the extra damage, fuel and greater
 hitting power of the BB; you are unmaneuverable in any case.

 >How do you survive being ogged...

 You don't, if the ogger is local and clued.  For this reason, plus the
 fact that getting kills is really hard in the first place, lagged
 players make terrible planet takers.

 >What types of roles do you find you can effectively play when lagged?

 Scout bomber, planet defender, escort (to some degree).  You can do
 anything that does not require dodging and aiming.  You can dogfight
 to a degree in a BB, but try to stay near a fuel planet.  You will
 need lots of fuel in order to fire enough to get enough lucky hits to
 kill people.

 >What do you do as an escort?

 Die... :)   Get between the planet and the enemy; try to keep opposing
 players away by liberal use of torpedos.  Det streams that will hit the
 planet.  

 As far as helping on guarded planet assaults, get in an AS and draw
 fire.  Get 1/2 screen from the planet and dodge, cloaked.

 People do in fact blink when beaming.  When they do not beam up armies, the
 ship is drawn normally over the planet.  However, when the army number on
 the planet changes (such as during beaming), the planet is redrawn.  The
 next update, the ship is again redrawn over the planet.  This gives rise to
 the blink effect.  It is actually quite obvious when someone is beaming if
 you can watch the galactic map.  Watch over a friend's shoulder some time as
 they play, you will easily see the blinking.

 >Am I hallucinating? It seems to work.

 You aren't hallucinating.  Just watch the map for blinking not for changes in
 army numbers.  You'll catch the army carriers all the time.  It's hard to do
 during combat, though.

 In fact, you only continue to see your opponents if they would be visible
 to your team on the long-range scanner without you.  I have often been
 left watching a screen full of torps looking to see if some of them will
 explode on an invisible hull, or even make the nothingness explode.

 The quick answer:  use common sense.  Watch where the enemies are picking up
 their armies from.  Ask yourself if the armies you're bombing are affecting
 them adversely in some way:

 1.  Forcing them to retreat further from the front to get armies
 2.  Making them visible on your teams' galactic maps when they normally
     wouldn't be (i.e., by being the scout "forward observer").
 3.  Forcing them to waste time dogfighting/chasing you (assuming you're not a
     squashable scout).
 4.  Forcing them to actually wait for pops/compete with each other for
     armies (not likely if they have 15+ planets).

 If you're bombing armies in a quadrant that enemy ships don't even enter,
 the answers are probably no/no/no/no.

 The idea behind scout bombing is not to bomb for the sake of bombing.  It's
 to make life harder on your enemies.

 Opinions differ, but I think it's reasonable to keep scout bombing right
 up until genocide.  You can't be everywhere, so if you set yourself a duty
 like this, be content to stick to it even while your team loses.

 However, keep in mind the real goal of bombing in such circumstances:  to
 help prevent them from taking your last planet(s).  They will probably always
 have a few armies (i.e. enough to genocide you) no matter what you do, so
 the main idea is to make sure that they have to travel a long ways to
 pick them up after they get a kill.  So your priority should be to flatten
 the fuel and repair planets between the two home worlds, because those are the
 most convenient places for them to pick up armies.  It's less important to
bomb
 the far reaches where nobody goes anyway (although this is a highly suitable
 role when you have serious net lag).  Also, you want to reduce the number
 of enemy ships with kills, not increase it.  Bombing is my favorite way
 to og; I just bomb until somebody with a kill comes to try to stop me,
 then I go for mutual destruction.  It's not worth giving up a kill just to
bomb
 a couple armies, unless you think you can keep ALL of their planets flat.
 If you find yourself giving up kills, adjust your style so you're running
 away more; even if you get no bombing done, you'll distract some enemies
 sometimes, and you enable your team to see enemies on the galactic map
 that are near you.

 Another consideration is how capable a fighter you are, compared to your
 teammates, and this is partly dependent on lag.  I guess the most crucial
 roles, the ones that you want good fighters to be handling, are (1) ogging
 and (2) protecting/using the few armies that your planet produces.  Also
 you want a clueful defender to stay near the planet, someone that will
 reliably phaser a cloaker.  If your team isn't filling these roles,
 then maybe you'd better stop bombing and do one of them, and hope that
 you can hold out long enough to get some new teammates.

 Detting range is fixed for all ships.  This is easily verified by looking at
 defs.h:

 (To get an idea of det range as opposed to other ranges, I left select
 #define's in....)

 #define GWIDTH 100000   /* galaxy is 100000 spaces on a side */
 #define WARP1 20        /* warp one will move 20 spaces per update */
 #define SCALE 40        /* Window will be one pixel for 20 spaces */
 #define EXPDIST 350     /* At this range a torp will explode */
 #define DAMDIST 2000    /* At this range a torp does damage */
 #define SHIPDAMDIST 3000 /* At this range, an exploding ship does damage */
 #define PLASDAMDIST 2500 /* At this range, a plasma does damage */
 #define DETDIST 1600    /* At this range a torp can be detonated */
 #define PHASEDIST 6000  /* At this range a player can do damage with phasers
*/

 from getship.c:

             shipp->s_detcost = 100; /* assault */
             shipp->s_detcost = 100; /* battleship: */
             shipp->s_detcost = 100; /* cruiser: */
             shipp->s_detcost = 100; /* destroyer: */
             shipp->s_detcost = 100; /* scout:  */
             shipp->s_detcost = 100; /* starbase */

 Detting is identical for any given ship.

     The problem with escorting is that you never know, for certain, what
 you should do.  I remeber a run I had not too long ago where it seemed
 to me that I did everything wrong.  I escorted when I had kills.  I came
 in behind the guy I was escorting.  I detted strangely.  I got hit by
 torps.  I died without injuring the enemy.  While I was writing an
 appology, the guy I had been escorting finished taking Rom, genociding
 the Roms.  His messages to me descibed my run as "awesome".  
     Here are some general rules of thumb for escorting:
     1) Give your passenger some creadit.  You don't have to det every torp.
  Just ones that she can't dodge.
     2) In a wide open field, don't kill anyone.  Rarely even fire.  You
 will be trying to outrun most random encounters.
     3) Try to intecept the real Oggers.  If you can get them before they
 planned to fire torps, you can not only keep you passenger alive, but
 often stay fit enough to keep guarding her.
     4) Lead your passenger.
     5) Don't fire torps.  Especially, don't fire torps over your passenger.
  Remeber, she is in charge.  Get your phasor lock to let her know where
 an Ogger is, and let her dicide if the he lives or dies.
     6) If you plan to cloak and distract the foe, make him really panic. 
 Going for Sir isn't nearly as effective as going for Rom.
     7) If you plan to stay uncloaked, make yourself the best target. 
 Against determined defenders, this may include flying directly over then
 and diing.
     8) Shield flashes mean a lot of things.  Most of the time, if an escort
 flashes shield, it means, "I am really here to escort.  I did not show
 up here randomly.".  After that, a passenger will flash for "follow me",
 or an escort for "OK, I understand".  Of course, any time someone
 flashes, check messages.  She may mean something else.

 Definitions:
 ------------
   Double genocide:  A double genocide is a conquer of the galaxy followed
     by race A genociding race B followed by race A genociding race C.

     E.g., from a fresh galaxy, Feds genocide Roms, then Feds genocide Oris.

   Comeback:  A comeback is a conquer of the galaxy followed by race A
     genociding B followed by race C genociding race A.

     E.g., from a fresh galaxy, Feds genocide Roms, then Oris genocide Feds.

   Invalid genocide:  A genocide with an insufficient number of planet
     takers/army bombers participating (sum of both winning and losing
     sides).  The threshold was set arbitrarily at 6.  This filters out
     (approximately) genocides of undefended races and t-mode-less
     genocides.  Invalid genocides are ignored in detecting doubles/
     comebacks.

   Diagonal genocide:  A race that validly genocides the race of the
     diagonally opposite quadrant.  Diagonal genocides are ignored in
     detecting doubles/comebacks.

     E.g., Feds genocide Klis.

   Other genocide:  After filtering out diagonal and invalid genocides,
     the genocide sequence did not match a double or comeback.  This could
     be caused by a surrender, a coup, loss of T-mode followed by
     formulation of new teams, and other cruft.  Any subsequent genocides
     are also marked as "other" until the next conquer.

 Stats:
 ------
   [ Log file covers 1/4/92 through 5/21/92 ]

   Genocides: 443  Conquers: 249  Surrenders:  37
   Genocide breakdown:

 Analysis:
 ---------
   A lot of cruft in the genocide logs!  Weirdness such as Feds genocide
   Roms followed by Oris genocide Klis.  It's not easy to determine when
   the galaxy has reached a munged state.  Lowering the threshold had
   little effect, but raising the threshold to 8 (meaning more active
   planet takers and bombers) changed the double/comeback ratio to 69/30
   (70%/30%) but invalidated 226 of the genocides.

 After some thought I realized what the cruft was.  I modified my server
 somewhere during the logging period so that the galaxy was conquered if a
 race owned three systems *ignoring independent planets*.  Under the old
 system, the Feds might genocide the Roms and then genocide the Klis, but not
 conquer because of an independent planet in Kli space.  So if Klis reenter
 as Roms and coup, instant LPS.  So instead of a second genocide the server
 jumps straight to conquer.  Similar things happen if a surrender follows a
 genocide.

 The revised counts:

   Double:     140  (73%)   (66 x 2 + 74 = 206)

 Subject: Re: Last Planet Stands
 Date: Wed, 20 May 92 19:29:10 GMT

 The thing about last planet stands is, the defenders have all these
 ships near the planet, and the attackers have to come a long way
 to get there.  So if the attackers don't synchronize their attack,
 they'll always be severely outnumbered at the planet, and with equal
 skill levels on both sides, they'll seldom take it.  But if the
 attackers synchronize, they can get eight ships in the action at one
 time (for a brief time, to be sure), and during that time there's
 some chance of taking the planet.  If they keep trying attacks like
 this, which really don't take that long to set up, the planet will likely 
 fall.  But I've seldom seem this kind of syncrhonization.
 So here are a few words (well, you know me, lots of words) of advice
 on how I think it can be best achieved:

 The basic idea is to get everybody ready to charge from diverse
 angles simultaneously.  It's like a base ogg.  You don't want to
 all meet at some planet, because if you all come from the same angle
 it's too easy for them to stop you.  During the set-up time, when
 you're waiting for your teammates to get up to the striking distance
 (which is typically about 1/6 galaxy width away from the target), it's
 essential that you be able to AVOID fights.  This is the skill of waiting,
 to be able to keep your ship healthy and full of fuel, even when there
 are enemies that want to force a mutual kill.  Useful tactics for
 waiting include pressoring, cloaking, and running.  I usually just use
 a handful of torps on ships that charge me, just to make them slow down.
 If you can do useful things while you wait, like protecting carriers,
 faking attack runs (without going into danger), or grabbing nearby armies,
 more power to you.

 When enough people are ready (and it might be nice if they send a message
 like "ready", or else send a message like "fuel" if they look
 like they're in position but they're not ready), somebody usually gives
 the "go" signal, and the real action starts.  I like to have everybody
 cloak at this time.  This is a nice acknowledgement of the "go" signal,
 and also serves both to disguise who is carrying and to help avoid
 premature engagements.  It's very important to be able to trap some
 of the good defending oggers away from the action, and not kill them.
 So the best time for the charge to start is right when the oggers have
 come out to get you.  Everybody cloaks and blows past them, and perhaps
 some of the escorts uncloak to pressor them and spray a few torps to slow
 them down so they can't get back to the planet in time.  A good
 rule of thumb is, once somebody has called "go", don't kill anybody
 unless they're right at the target planet.  Even then, you have to
 be careful that your army-carrier doesn't get caught in the splatter.

 The main medium of communication for coordinating such an attack is
 the galactic map.  The attackers can see each other, can judge when
 enough people are equidistant to the target and apparently ready,
 and so forth.  Distress calls are good too, especially to show that
 you carry armies.  And name the target you're going for, if there's
 a choice.  But too much typing of messages is detrimental.

 The same ideas work when the defenders have multiple planets.  In
 this case you usually want to attack all of them simultaneously.
 Be sure not to argue about which planet to "leave for last".  Everybody
 will probably have a pretty good idea which planets are most valuable,
 but that doesn't mean they'll always attack there first.  For one thing
 they don't want to be too predictable, and for another, the defenders
 have a lot of say about which planet ends up last too, in the way
 they distribute their forces.  Concentrate on getting synchronization,
 and let people attack what they want to attack.  Similarly, sometimes
 you have some people who want to og the plasma scums, some who want
 to beam down armies, some who want to og their base (if they have one),
 some who want ogg a suspected army-carrier, etc.  So long as they
 all do it at the same time, they'll help each other out, even when
 going for different goals.

 No, it's never a fluke or random.  Yes, you can control it.

 First, to convince yourself that you can control your planet hook, go to the
 center of a planet and stay there at warp 0.  Now pick a direction and hit
 warp 1.  Immediately hit 'o' for orbit and notice how you seemingly jump
 onto the side of the planet that you were headed for.  This is the basic
 concept behind the planet hook.

 Now, in practice you won't bother to slow down to warp 0, of course, since
 orbiting velocity is warp 2 and you may be under heavy fire.  That is, you
 only need to make sure that you have slowed down to warp 2 to be able to use
 'o' to hook.  Basically, just dodge some torps as you near the planet and
 look for a "hole" in the torp stream trajectories so you can hook onto the
 planet and avoid all of the torps while you beam down armies or bomb.  Your
 mission will become difficult to carry out once there are more than 3 torp
 streams going through the planet and near impossible if one of the defenders
 gets a phaser lock on you before you reach the planet.

 The hardest part in taking a defended planet is to get on it in the first
 place.  If the defenders are orbiting the planet it will make your job
 easier since it is harder for them to see you on the galactic map.  Good
 defenders will space themselves apart around the planet in a circle and
 temporarily turn off the show-planet-names and show-resources on their
 tactical/galactic maps to make it easier for them to "see" you.

 An easier but less precise method of carrying out a planet hook is to use
 'l' to lock on to the planet instead of 'o'.  Now, if you're an assault ship,
 you have to make sure that you are going at warp 4 as you enter the outer
 radius of the planet before you hit 'l'.  The assault ship will automatically
 slow down to warp 2 by the time you are at the center of the planet and at
 the last instant you can turn you ship so that it is slightly to the left or
 slightly to the right of center so you will hook onto that side of the
 planet.  Note that different ships have different deceleration rates so,
 depending on your ship type, you need to be going at different warp speeds
 when you hit the planet's radius before you lock on (otherwise you will not
 be at the center of the planet when you slow down to warp 2).

 Without the planet hook, you are as good as dead against clueful defenders
 because they know where you will orbit the planet.  The hook will buy you
 some time in orbiting the planet and you may even be able to take/bomb the
 planet from right under their noses.
 (I remember bombing 13 armies from Rom against 5 defenders.  I had to lose
  2 phaser locks on my way into the planet but once I got inside the
  planet's radius I was home free.  They couldn't hit me for almost a full
  revolution around the planet :)

 Oh, and about all this bull about "just try and do that under me", look,
 nobody is perfect.  I have taken agris in a cruiser under clueful defenders
 (yes, that means you too, CMU).  The truth of the matter is that sometimes
 people have an off-day, or they lose a packet at a critical moment, or
 they're not paying enough attention, or they're busy typing a message, 
 or they're out of fuel, or their mouse slipped, or they simply miss.
 Sometimes it's a matter of luck.  However, using the planet hook is something
 that will tip the scales in your favor.  Above all, if you fail, don't lose
 hope.  Try again.  Your opponents will make a mistake sooner or later :)

 Good luck and I hope some of you learned something!

 Yes, I noticed this a while ago, and I imagine that most scout bombers
 have as well.  The quick fix is to remember that while you are locked
 on a planet, and your speed decreases, you can still hit a faster warp
 key for a momentary burst of speed.  I use max warp, and don't stop
 until I'm just about on top of it.

 One fundamental tactic which I don't think is clearly stated in the archives:
 Strive for something like the following position relative to your enemy:

   =-O    <-- you (moving right)


    O     <-- enemy (moving up)
    !

 I.e. you want him flying at you, so he'll eat your torps, and you want
 to show him your flank, so that (a) he has a difficult time leading
 his torps correctly, and (b) you can dodge his torps simply by
 accelerating or decelerating (as well as by turning).  Needless to say
 you'll only have this ideal position for a moment, so fire a volley
 of torps right then.

 Typically you can achieve this position either by "intercepting" an
 enemy (look to see where he's flying and step into his flight path),
 or by going some place where the enemy doesn't want you (e.g. bombing
 his planets) thereby enticing him to charge towards you.

 1) You can not win without taking planets.  No team will win without its
 scums.  Even the best Oggers and bombers will let someone slip from time
 to time, so if everyone on your team is bombing and Ogging, you will
 lose.

 2) That said, it should be noted that more people are trying to take
 planets than any other said occupation.  While highly skilled planet
 scums are much more dangerous, moderate, or even poor scums can get the
 job done.  A highly skilled player is best used in some other occupation.

 3) The pramary advantage of having a skilled player escorting instead of
 taking planets herself, is that she can escort without kills.  So she
 can spend part of her time Ogging, bombing, etc, and part of it
 escorting.

 4) Unskilled players can SC bomb, but there's no question that skilled
 players will give away less kills in the process.  Unskilled players
 don't always know when it is OK to give away a kill, and when it isn't.

 5) Unskilled players Ogg very badly.

 >Assume that you can do 1 role, and you are equally good at all roles, and if

 >you don't do it, it probably won't be done.  Which should you do?

 If you can assume that no one will do any of these, you should quit. 
 Otherwise, you should expect to be in a BB defending Vega, and hoping
 there's a clue shift.  If for some reason the other team is equally
 unskilled, you should still quit (what's the point?).  You should take
 planets if you insist on playing.

 >I personally think you should be an ogger first, then bomber, then planet  
 >taker, then escort.

 In a game with low, but some clue, I would agree with you.  This seems
 to be the order of skill, with the exception of escort.  
   In a high skill game, escort is more important than planet taker
 (you've got gobs of planet takers who all need escorts).  I was in a
 game tonight where several of the enemies had several kills (like 6 or
 more).  We had to team Ogg them.  When drpepper quit out, our life
 became much easier, even though he didn't take planets, ogg, or bomb.

 English translation: if the planet is marked as "cheap" (i.e. it was knocked
 independent while defended by <= 2 players), you get nothing.  Note that
 it requires two players on the team which owns it OR two players on the
 team in whose space it is.  So if you're Rom and you scum scum Klingus during
 a fed vs rom game, you get no credit.  However, if the feds take it back or
 you take it from the feds, you WILL get credit.

 Anyway.

 You get the core bonus IF it's a core planet AND it's not in your space
 AND there are enough players on the team which took it over.  So no,
 you don't get a bonus for retaking your own core.

 Bottom line: 3rd race scumming doesn't help your tournament stats / DI, though
 it WILL show up in the 'I' window.  However, retaking scummed 3rd race
 planets DOES help your tournament stats.

 Subject: On death and dying

   On Death and Dying

   I hear a fair amount about this subject from other good players, but no
 one has really written anything authoritative on the subject. 
 Nevertheless, death is something that happens to all of us no matter how
 good, and now matter what our ranks.  So it is a subject which deserves
 some looking into.

   Why do I want to die?

   There are a number of reasons to want to die, but they all amount to
 the same thing -- I am better off in a new ship at home than in my
 current ship, here.
   The most obvious reason to feel this way is because your ship is
 damaged or out of fuel.  This is a perfectly legitimate reason.  You
 want to look at your current position and make sure that your ship is
 not more valuable where is currently is than at home (ie.  A crippled
 empty Cruiser will do more to stop the planet taker than nothing.). 
 However, much of the time, the reason that your are crippled or out of
 fuel is because you have already attempted your mission and are
 suffering from the results.  In this case, death is often the best
 option.
   There are also many times when you are needed at or near the home-world
 quickly.  Perhaps a valuable player is being Ogged there, or the planet
 is being, or about to be bombed.  In many cases, the mission at home is
 more important than the mission you're on.  In this case, also, it is
 often worth dying.  It can often be a tough decision whether to die or
 not.  Try to rank possible missions in terms of how important, and how
 immediate they are.
   Once in a while, you are just out in the boonies.  There could be an
 one of a number of reasons for this, but it happens.  Normally, it's
 best to get back is quickly as possible, and that means death.
   Sometimes you want to die right away just so you don't die later and
 give kills to the wrong person.  Or you may be surrounded and know that
 you are going to die really soon.  Again, there are people who you want
 to kill you, and those who you don't.  That brings up the next question.

   How do I die? (Seems easy, no?  Just turn off shield and det.)

   Having decided to die, you want to make sure that you do as little
 damage to your team as possible.  So you don't want to give kills to
 potential planet takers, and you don't want to blow up on team-mates
 unless they also want to die.  The latter is almost always case
 dependent, so I'll talk about the former.
   If you can die to a team-mate, DO.  This can be very hard.  basicly,
 you have to fly over an out-of-fuel opponent while your team-mate shoots
 at him.  There's about a 50/50 chance that your team-mate will get the
 kill.  This often isn't possible, so don't worry if you can't pull it
 off.
   Give your kill to the enemy SB.  The plan is so well known that good
 SBs make a habit out of not killing ships that try this.  So you need
 some tricks to *make* the SB kill you.  The most obvious one, is to fly
 at her firing.  Of course, that's so obvious, that she should be
 expecting it, and presser you away.  Therefore, I find that there are 3
 things to do to make a SB kill you.  First, go into repair mode, or at
 least slow down enough to gain fuel quickly.  The SB will not know how
 much fuel you have, and may get paranoid.  After this, when you turn to
 attack her, she may decide to kill you after all.  Second, try cloaking.
   A lot of a SB's power comes from its tractors and pressers, so you take
 a lot away by cloaking.  If it pressers you as you cloak, run until
 you're outside presser range and return.  Otherwise, just fly right over
 it.  No base likes that.  Third, you can shoot at some of the flunkies
 who always hang around bases pretending to escort it, but really just
 trying to get kills.  Pick one who has a kill already, because she, more
 likely to panic and try to bet the base to help her.
   Just as good a a base to give kills to is a robot.  Iggy doesn't exist
 on all servers, and isn't around all the time on servers that do have
 him, so it pays to plan ahead and bring in a couple of Guardian-type
 'bots.  Be at peace with them until you need to die, and then declare
 hostile.  This play doesn't work everywhere, but if you're on the
 outskirts of neutral space, it is certainly a viable alternative.
   Enemy or neutral planets make a good graveyard.  The disadvantages are
 that they often take too long, and they require that you get to them. 
 The advantage is that you can bomb them while you're there, and either
 kill enemy armies, or bring in a 'bot to kill you later.
   Let kill scums rack it up.  If someone has a bunch of kills, it doesn't
 hurt to give away one more.  There is no friend of the about to die like
 plasma.  If it's going to miss, phaser it as it gets close.
   Scout bombers are not completely safe to give kills to but are better
 than a lot of people.  Normally, they aren't interested in using the
 kills that they get.  On those occasions when they are willing to carry,
 at least they are no longer bombing.  There are times when giving a
 bomber a kill in order to get her off of bombing is actually a good idea.
   If you can convince an enemy Ogger to kill you, you're often in good
 shape.  Not only have you gotten them to waste fuel, but, like the
 bomber, you have tempted them with the option of changing roles.  Lots
 of times, it's hard to get an Ogger to kill you.  Be aggressive.
   Give a kill to a "pure" dogfighter.  There are often some bozos around
 who will never be troubled to pick up armies, letting along deliver
 them.  These guys have the added advantage that they are often crawling
 all over themselves to kill you.
   Give a kill to a terrible planet taker.  Some people seem to have a
 knack for not avoiding Oggs.  There are some so bad that it's easier to
 give them kills and then Ogg them than to bomb (Army hotel: Armies go
 in.  They don't come out.).  Go for it.  Of course, you should then Ogg
 them, or let your team know that they will soon carry.
   Give the kill to an incredible hotshot.  This sounds silly, but there
 are some people who will always have kills no matter how hard you try to
 keep them from getting them.  It's not *good* to give them kills, but
 the worst person to give kills to is someone who is good at planet
 taking, but is having trouble getting kills tonight.  Don't give kills
 to mediocre players.

 "With my last breath I spit at thee."
   
   As you go down, you might as well make it count.  Try to hurt someone
 who doesn't want to be hurt, kill someone who doesn't want to be killed,
 or suck the fuel out of someone who your team-mate is Ogging.  Often,
 the best way to die is to Ogg someone -- successfully or not.  This is
 especially true if you have to give your kill to someone who you don't
 want to have it.  Remember that an explotion right on top of someone
 does 100 point of damage in anything but a SC (which does 75).  Take
 advantage of it.

 Ok everybody, repeat after me...
   "Dogfighting is useless... dogfighting is useless....dogfighting is useless"
   As any good player knows, dogfighting ability means squat!  All you
 need to be able to do is suicide.. if you can do that, then you can be a
 good player.  Dogfighting skill used to be something that everyone
 thought was mondo, until that great guro of netrek, terence "God" chang
 taught us CMU *veterns* about ogging.  To be a good, respected player
 (IMHO) this is what you need to know:
   1)  How to observe the "flow" of the game on the galactic map without
 being a free kill on the tactical.  This includes the following:
     a)  Spotting when people pick up armies (either from the net-blink
 that occurs when they pick up, or by observing how many armies are on a
 planet prior to and after the suspected carrier leaves.
     b)  Learning to guess which planet a carrier will go for and
 proceeding post-haste to that planet
     c) Learning to observe group enemy movements and determining if they
 are ogg waves/escort waves or just coincidence.
   2)  Learning to type and respond to messages without needing to fly
 away from the front.  
   3)  Learning that speed kills, and always go max warp when not fighting
 someone.
   4)  Learning to think ahead of time, and always know what you are going
 to do when you come back in at your home planet.  This can include the
 following:
     a)  Continue to ogg the person you missed
     b)  Kill a bomber that you noticed going to a core world
     c)  Grab a base to store armies
     d)  Scout bomb if you noticed no-one is doing it
     e)  Ogg another suspected carrier 
     (Note: There are not in any particular order)
   5)  Learn to spot people with kills and know who carries with 1 kill,
 and who likes to wait until they have 2.  This also includes the
 following of their movements on the galactic.

   These are 5 major attributes that I think seperate a "clued" person
 from a newbie.  A newbie concentrates on the Tactical display, and hense
 fails to observe the entire "play" being performed about him.  A
 "vetern" (to use the term loosely) spends more time watching the game
 evolve on the galactic map, and only concentrates on the tactical when
 he/she has arrived at the location that they desired.  As the samurai
 maxim says, "A person who has mastered an art, reveals it in his every
 action".

 Subject: Re: beginner UN-luck

 I think the real issue is that netrek is played on two different
 levels. There is the upper level, where ships are fighting eachother;
 and there is the underlying level, the armies being nuked and planets
 being taken. I think the more clue you have, the more you worry about
 the underlying level. The less clue you have, the more you worry about
 fighting enemy ships. 
 There's very little reason to hang around the front and dogfight people
 when you could be off bombing or ogging. If you're trying to "win the
 game" you need to destroy all enemy armies. So pick a role: bomb, ogg,
 or beam. The only place that dogfighting fits in here is picking up
 kills to be able to beam.

 It's true that dogfighting skills will keep you alive in many
 situations, so it is usefull to learn good dogfighting. The best
 time for that is on an empty server, before tmode starts up. That's
 the only time I dogfight. Once that "t" flag is in your tstat window,
 you should be working towards winning the game. If you're still
 dogfighting, you're not being useful to your team.

 Date: 19 Oct 92 04:03:16 GMT

 Well, I'm bored, so here is part of my Collected Knowledge of
 Scoutbombing.  In no particular order.

 1.  Scouts can perform a very important function in base oggs
     by flying around cloaked and detting single torps.  Since
     their maneuverability is high, scouts are less at risk of
     actually getting hit with torps; detting single torps forces
     the base to either 'play honest' and not fire at explosions
     or to wtemp firing on a gamble that the ship's really there.

 2.  Know your turning radius.  At warp 12, you have a great
     potential of walking too far into a developing firefight
     if you're not careful.  Make sure you *always* have enough
     turning radius to escape the clutches of any larger ship.

 3.  Never cloak while tractored, phasered, or within tractor
     or phaser range.

 4.  Always go as far as strategically possible to get armies.
     Don't pick from planets that your regular carriers might
     use unless you think they won't get there until the planet
     is bombed.

 5.  Assuming that the enemy is relatively flat, four of your
     ships are worth one of their armies.

 6.  Don't lock on to a planet until the moment that you have
     to.  Locking on lowers speed unnecessarily when closing in.
     Ships locked onto planets from afar can be targetted as
     having a destination, and that destination can be protected.

 7.  Feigning fuellessness or damage can be an easy way to get a
     kill, but timing is essential.  Always be prepared to book
     if the enemy decides to whittle you down with phasers before
     coming in hard.

 8.  Scout torps look just as dangerous as other torps.

 9.  Scout phasers are utterly useless except at extremely short
     ranges (on top of) or against other scouts.  Since your fuel
     tank is small, save up for a string of fast torps instead.

 10. Consider the enemy's perception when creating a new fake move.
     If the enemy is clueless or combat-hungry, fake for the planet
     and pause momentarily, trying to arrive cloaked in orbit just
     after the torps pass through.  If the enemy is patient, try to
     exert enough pressure to stick her to the planet or force her
     to call for help.  If the enemy is fixated on defense, consider
     faking for the planet and uncloaking to kill her when she's
     left her torps out.

 11. Feel the enemy pressure like a wind through a field.  If the
     stalks of grass feel like they're bending your way, flow with
     the wind and shift away, maintaining a cushion of safety while
     staying threatening.  If the flow is too strong, divide it
     like a knife and try to break through before it can slow and
     reverse its course.

 12. Use your torpedoes not only to damage the enemy, but to coax
     her into mistakes.  A line of torpedoes laid out a little ahead
     of a ship can cause it to slow or veer, increasing the chance
     that you'll get to your objective.

 13. If trapped by a base, relax.  You will die soon, and your
     objective is to die in the manner of your choosing.  Build up
     fuel as fast as you can, and then either jet towards the base,
     forcing it to destroy you, or feint towards the base and then
     attempt to break free before it can tractor you again.

 14. Always send a message to your teammates whenever any enemy
     picks up, along with her location.  Also send messages if you
     detect a long term threat building.

 15. Watch the exact trajectories of enemies.  If an enemy picks up
     at Earth and points towards Eri, she has asked to be killed by
     your oggers.

 16. Assist your oggers in deep backcourt oggs by getting between the
     ogged enemy and her friends before she knows that you're there.

 17. Map the nearest neutral planets for fueling purposes.

 18. Resist the temptation to refit and ogg or take full-time.  Every
     team needs a scoutbomber.

 19. A scout has two modes; hover and break.  There is no reason for
     a scout to be going any warps other than 0 (refuelling and
     being nearly unnoticeable on the galactic), 4 (combat speed)
     and 12 (general movement speed).  Don't waste your one
     advantage by being timid or overly cautious.

 20. Rank is meaningless.  For the scoutbomber, there can be only
     success or failure.

 That's all for today.

 Scout bombing is an excercise in risk management.  It it sometimes
 worthwhile to attempt a suicide bomb, but there are many situations
 where the risk outweighs the potential gain.  Red Shirt's treatise
 on scout play is a good place to go for information; here are some of
 the things I've noticed.

 KNOW YOUR ENEMY

 There are some players (Streaker, for example) who simply *love* to sit 
 by a planet with armies, get the SC kill and go take planets.  If someone 
 consistently does this, under NO circumstances should you give them a kill; 
 never allow your opponent to play their game.  If this kind of player is 
 on the other team, I'll often bait him by faking repeatedly for the 
 planet he's guarding, with no intention of ever actually trying to bomb.  

 TAKE WHAT THEY GIVE YOU

 Remember that a scout can almost always find an unguarded planet.
 Fake for the guarded planet and go bomb an unguarded one whenever 
 possible; don't think about bombing a guarded planet unless there are
 no unguarded armies.

 DON'T BE STUPID

 You'll rarely get to bomb a planet under a good phaserlocker.  If it's
 a good phaserlocker with kills, that's not a big deal, although if
 there are unguarded armies somewhere, see the above point.  If it's 
 a good phaserlocker with no kills, bail out and wait for better odds.
 Side note not directly related to scout bombing: some players are more
 effective when they *don't* have kills.  Know them and don't worry much
 about giving them kills.

 BE PATIENT

 If there are no unguarded armies, and no armies guarded by people with
 kills (or the base), you can think about bombing under a player with
 no kills.  If they suck, go for it; you can usually get in and out
 and humiliate them in the process.  If they're mediocre-good, it's an
 iffy proposition; if they don't get you on the way in, they'll probably
 get you on the way out.  If they do, they'll now have a kill, and you'll
 be taking 20-30 seconds to get back into position. As a general rule,
 I would say it's better to wait it out; if they sit there forever,
 eventually some other planet will pop and you can bomb it.  I will
 fake in for the planet to keep them busy and out of fuel, but rarely
 will I go for a bomb if there is a defender sitting on the planet.
 He's more likely to get bored than you are.

 After a while, you just get used to it. When I was at CMU, I used to get
 flustered whenever I got any lag at all: I never played at sequent because it
 was just too annoying for me. When I came to Rochester, the lag seemed really
 bad at first, but I quickly got used to it.

 About 3 months ago, some router near Cornell started tossing random packets
 into the wall. First it was 3%, then 5%, then 7, then 10. About a month ago,
 things really fell apart, and almost every game I've played in the last month
 has been at 10-20% packet loss (the INL game against xgolems was at 16%). It's
 reached the point where anything less than 10% seems really good; it's been
 so long, I don't really remember what it's like to play with no packet loss.

 Basically, local players play by reacting to what they see: you see some torps
 fired at you, and you dodge. With bad lag, you can't do that; you'll never get
 a good look at the torps coming at you, and if you wait until you see them to
 dodge, all you're going to see is some nice explosions (unless your net drops
 those too). To play with lag, you have to get used to the fact that there's a
 lot happening that you just can't see.

 Some of the ways you can counter this are:

 1) *always* be dodging. Spin left, swerve right, change speeds a lot. That
way,
 even if you never see the enemy fire, he'll still have a hard time hitting a
 target moving in a random pattern. Unpredictability is often mistaken for
 good dodging.

 2) Try to sucker your opponent into doing something, so you can counter before
 actually seeing anything. A classic one is to fly directly at an enemy, then
at
 a distance of 2 inches or so (which is really about 1 1/2 inches with the lag
 factor) turn 90 degrees, tractor, and fire 10 torps about 1/2 inch in front of
 him (10, because 2 will get lost in the network). If you time it right, he'll
 pound 8 torps into the spot you just turned away from, and your torps will
 catch him right in the face. Of course, if he doesn't fall for it, you just
 wasted about 200 fuel...but it is often quite effective. The key is, you know
 what he is going to do, and so you can prepare for it.

 3) Remember that you can't really see what your opponent is doing, so think of
 *everything* that he might do, and use what you can see as clues to what he
 might be doing, or about to do. If you see a 2 kill cruiser turn his nose
 toward you, turn sideways, hit warp 7, and fire a phaser in front of him. If
 you get lucky, you'll catch the plasma in his face; but, you can't afford to
 wait till you see it, because all you're going to see is the explosion, or the
 plasma flying behind you. Similarly, use what players do to find out about the
 galaxy: if you see an enemy scout speeding to one of your planets that seems
 to have 4 armies on it, odds are good he's really trying to bomb the armies
 you can't see..so cut him off, and reach for that full update key.

 4) Be prepared to react to some fraction of your commands get delayed or lost.
 You have to be ready to send a new cloak or shields request if the last one
 didn't seems to work, and count on the apropriate fraction of your weapons
 misfiring. Usually, this means giving yourself extra time to react since
things
 don't always work the first time.

 5) have an easy to reach update all key. You'll be using it a lot.


 I can also see why FITB gets angry a lot...I find playing with lots of lag
very
 stressful. The problem is, if you want to avoid exploding all the time, you
 have to spend every second playing What If...what if he just fired at me? what
 if my shields don't go up? what if there are armies on that planet I can't
see?
 It takes a tremendous amount of concentration to try to Fill In The Blanks :-)
 Then, you go to og some carrier who's all alone, and you blow it because your
 phaser and half your torps get sent to the great bit-bucket in the sky, and
 then he has the nerve to send you "haha, you suck", when a trained chimpanzee
 on a real network could have killed him...oooh, it just makes you want to put
 a dent in your table.....


 But things are looking up...I just pinged CMU, and only got 6% packet loss.
 Maybe my network connection might get fixed after all.

 We should also add the "How to Bomb a Planet Under Anybody" list.

 There are only a handful of tactics that work against the clueful.
 1) Approach the planet, dodge back and miss the fired torps by as little as
    possible.  Jump back on the planet when the last torp gets by.  Start
    bombing.  If you get a lucky bomb (about near 50% actually) you can
    bomb the planet before he can det all the torps and fire a new stream.

 2) Approach the planet at warp 5.  Go through the planet, and again dodge
    the torps by as little as possible.  Do as above.

 3) Go near planet.  If the guy won't shoot at you, try making a big circle
    around the planet.  This usually convinces the guy that you are, in fact,
    orbitting the planet.  Again, dodge the torp stream.

 4) Go through some other planet, and then go to your desired planet.  Enemy
    usually fires at wrong planet.

 5) Enemy is ultra-clueful and expects you to do one of the above.  Just lock
    on to your planet and bomb.  By the time he realizes you went straight in,
    you may be on the planet and bombing.

 Detting may or may not help for any of the above strategies.  Detting is
 most ineffective if you, the enemy, and the torps are almost in a straight
 line.  The reason is that the enemy usually fires at the exploded torps.
 If you are in a straight line, then he still gets the phaser lock.  If you
 aren't in a line, then there is a good chance that he may fire into thin
 air.

 >Which brings up another question : why is the server wasting its time sending

 >save bandwidth.

    Well, the server has to send updates at the updates-per-second requested
    by the client so that your tactical view is correct.  What galactic-update-
    rarely does is wait 5 client draw-cycles (server updates) before drawing a
    player, even though the information is there each time if the player is
    on your tactical screen.  As for players outside of the tactical view, the
    server's policy is to send location info at a rate of about once per 2
    seconds (with some minor exceptions), regardless of the update rate.  So
    if you're running at 5 updates/sec and have galactic updates set to rarely,
    the galactic map is being drawn about once per second and you're not
    missing too much information outside the tactical square.

    Within the tactical portion of the galactic map is a another story.
    At rare galactic updates, the client could draw a cloaked player almost
    a full second after the server sends the information.  Even though the
    location sent is randomized, I think this makes it harder to pin point
    a cloaker.  And for people who phaser on the galactic map, once you hit
    a cloaker with phasers, galactic-update-frequent draws as many updates
    of the '??' as the client's update frequency.  Galactic-update-rarely
    stays at 1/5 that rate.  My conclusion: scrap it :)

 Well, after testing this *blush* your tractors go off.  Others remain on.
 However, I probably play against fools who just disengage the tractor after

 The DD can corner better on the "run away and cut back" move because it can
 decel into an equivalent or better turning radius faster.  It will lose a
 little speed by doing this, but it can afford to trade the speed for a
 better turn.  The SC is coming back towards it, and by cutting a faster
 turn it can get inside the SC on the turn and trade the loss in speed for a
 large reduction in the distance that needs to be travelled.

 > Huh?  I'm in a faster, more agile ship, how is he choosing the range?

 In most cases the SC gets to choose the range.  You are facing a ship that
 has better phasers (not much better, but still better), a little bit of
 tractor (compared to what is effectively no tractor/pressor for the SC),
 and better decel.  The DD only needs to stay between you and your target.
 I am not talking about a SC-DD dogfight in open space here, but a situation
 in anti-bombing where you have chased the SC away from the core and have it
 on the border of 3rd space or other similar situation.  The SC must get
 back past the DD to bomb.  If it can get by it will probably be able to
 outrun the anti-bomber to the planet.  The standard tactic I have seen used
 by bombers in this case is to get the chase up to a high-speed and then
 turn back to the core, leaving the anti-bomber to take a very wide turn to
 follow.  Unlike a CA, a DD can slow down faster than a SC from it's maxwarp
 and can beat the on the turn.

 Against a good bomber this probably won't work, but against someone like,
 oh say Subby [ :-) ], it means one crunchy scout to go with a side order of
 fries...

 >> Can anyone flying SC's please give me some pointers?
 >[Scads of good advice]

 One thing Joe didn't mention was a tactic on appraching the planet.
 Often you will have decided to bomb a planet and die, but you have a
 CA or BB bearing down you who is just at the edge of being too late.
 The statdard thing for the CA to do in that circumstance is to fire a
 spray at the planet, in order to keep you off of it long enough to
 close.  Also, oftern inexperienced players will fail to use phaser to
 try to prevent your bombing, but instead use torps sprays.

 The situation will look like this:

 The planet       The enemy
     _     torps   
    / \    xx xxxx    O
    \_/   x  x

 Now, if the torps will all clearly miss one side of the planet or the
 other, you should just get on the planet at the right spot to be there
 when the torps arrive.  And start bombing, of course... the problem is
 that torps wobble a lot, so even if the spray was originally aimed to
 one side or the other, strays may hit you anyway.

 So, what you do is hover (warp 4) off to one side of the spray or the
 other:

 The planet       The enemy
     _ S     
    /xx xxxx       O
    x_/x

 (You are the 'S'.)

 Prepare to miss the last torp of the spray with the minimum possible
 tolerance while it is still in front of the planet... and then hook
 the planet and bomb.  Like this:


 The planet      The enemy
     _ 
 x xxxxS        O
  x \_/
       

 You should get at least a half second of bombing this way, even
 against an enemy clue, because by the time he/she dets own, fires
 more, and the new torps arrive, you have already hooked and started
 bombing.

 Dunno much about SC bombing but one of my favorite tricks is to fly
 straight towards the planet (warp 12) with an enemy cruiser hot on your
 tail (warp 9).  Lock onto the planet and watch his blob of torps come
 in.  By now you should be approaching warp five and he should be going
 warp 9.  Dodge the torp stream and spin quickly around so that you are
 right on his tailpipe (preferably almost or in contact with his bitmap).
 Continue to bomb the planet then.  (Cloaked the whole time of course).
 I find this works because very few people fire straight out of their
 tailpipe when they are still approaching the planet that is about to be
 bombed.

 The response is long too.  Hopefully it will help someone.

 I find 2 good places to sit are in the corner, (now this does cut in on
 your options to run, but actually you'll get very few people chasing you
 into the corner) and on the back wall between the second and third
 planets.  Here you mimmic the movements of any attackers.  If they come
 to get you.. run.. when they turn around... so do you.

 :>Getting chased:
 (various running techniques deleted)
 I actually find just running at Warp 12 does the trick.  As you
 pull off their tactical... most people will go into "out of sight
 out of mind mode" and they'll just turn around and go away.

 Note: Crippling SC's is a _very_ VERY good way to annoy them.  Do this
 if at all possibly, because you then take out a player on their
 team for 10-15 seconds.  This is a lot of bombing time.

 :>In general, if you really want to bomb, you don't want to kill the
 :>anti bomber unless your goal is immediate (he is sitting on the planet
 :>with armies, and can't bomb it unless he dies).  

 This is true.  You want to bomb unattended planets if at all possible.
 A good way to do this is to fake for a planet with 5 armies, and then
 run to a planet and bomb the >5 armies. Then hopefully cloak and
 run back to the original planet if you think the enemy has used 
 it's fuel.
  
 :>Avoiding being chased:

 (Make this a rule... you don't die if no one shoots at you.)

 :>Where to bomb:
 :>
 :>Bombing the front line is really harsh on SC bombers, there is a lot

 :>to try to bomb.  If at all possible, try to talk the CA players at the
 :>front into bombing the front line for you, this lets you concentrate
 :>on core and the side planets.  

 The middle 6 planets are really not to much of a SC's domain. 
 Popcorn comes to mind.  Try and concentrate on the back 7.. hoping
 you team can take out armies on the middle 6.

 :>When to bomb:
 :>
 :>Ok, so you're in position, now do you go for the armies that just
 :>popped?  Look at your fuel, if it's too low, try to find the friendly
 :>fuel planet (see above), or sit at warp 0 and wait.  Going for planets
 :>behind the home planet uncloaked isn't too bad, but going for ones in
 :>front of it doesn't usually work.

 The best way to bomb is to be in a position where you have to travel
 the least distance.  Try to stay near the enemy agri's or in-between 3
 planets.  That way you can cloak and go in usually with ~800-100 fuel.

 :>If the enemy SB is "running" towards a pop and you think you can get

 :>opposite way, but what is the SB going to do with the kill?  I'm more
 :>likely to make a lemming run against an SB than against a ryche CA
 :>(hell, or even an Exodus CA :-).  

 Playing with the enemy base is often enjoyable for those boring
 moments... Talk to him.... taunt him when you bomb from under him...
 have a few laughs... Remember... it's usually boring as the base
 too... and at all costs give the base your kills.  Even if it 
 looks like you might live.. don't take the chance... consider
 yourself expendable.  Warp 12 gets you back in a hurry.

 :>Trading kill for armies:

 I prefer bombing and giving away the kill.. but you don't want to 
 give away a kill if the enemy really needs a kill to do something
 strategic.  (I.E. enemy has a indi planet... don't give up a 
 kill to someone unless you are _sure_ you can bomb the armies.)

 :>Planet approach:

 I actually often attempt to fly through enemy torp wobble. Most
 people expect the SC bomber to be close right or left to the 
 torp stream comming in, not in the middle of it. :)

 :>Bombing the planet:

 :>      -raise shields
 :>      -det

 I tend to try and avoid/take my chances rather than det... because
 it take away precious bombing time to raise shields... and also,
 detting enemy torps means he _immediately_ gets to fire more,
 rather than letting him decide when the torps are past you.

 :>This buys you a few extra seconds.  It's important to learn when to
 :>raise shields to suck torps while bombing.  

 A really good way not to suck torps is to learn to orbit on the 
 opposite side of where you enter the planet from... practice it,
 most people are thrown off by "orbit warping."

 :>Basic tips:

 :>Keep your eyes clued on the galactic, and keep a good eye on your
 :>personal message board, and glance at the team board occasionally (not
 :>that often, it is low priority).  I know some people think you should

 :>enemies well.  Basically, you can have intricate knowledge about what
 :>your opponents are doing, or know exactly what your team is doing, but
 :>not both (anyone who claims you can have intricate knowledge of both

 This is _essential_. I often feel the SC bomber's primary job
 is to info scum.  You should be able to tell your team where _every_
 army has gone to... because honestly.. you can basically do

 I missed out on the scout-bombing discussion because our netnews server
 was a week behind, but here are a few comments.

 If I'm the team's only deep bomber in a good game, my priority is to
 stay alive in their space waiting for planets to pop where I can bomb
 them uncontested.  Somebody dubbed this "passive bombing".  If at some
 point I have the only kill for my team, then I'll come back to pick up
 armies, but I am sure to announce this so that someone else will take
 over the bombing for me until I die.  It's very frustrating (and
 disastrous) to be captaining a clue game and assign one bomber, then
 have that bomber quietly stop bombing for a few minutes.

 But usually I combine ogging and bombing.  I'll lock onto a planet that
 I might be able to bomb, and if somebody with a kill comes to stop me
 I'll definitely consider trying to kill him.  He's often low on fuel,
 and if I cloak and make as if to bomb the planet he'll usually fly
 recklessly towards me.  Sometimes the fools even carry armies and do
 this.  I try to keep my options open, and I always look for the easiest
 target.  This is my normal mode of ogging.  I basically don't
 differentiate between the bombing role and the ogging role.  I judge
 how good a scout bomber is mainly by their ability to do this type of
 ogging.  Bombers that run away can be very useful, but it's the bombers
 with teeth that impress me.  I also often mutual ships without kills,
 either because I'm toast anyway and want to avoid giving them a kill,
 or because I have a friend in the area who can bomb.

 I also do a fair amount of escorting in a scout.  E.g. I might be a Fed
 bomber waiting for Rom planets to pop, and some teammate wants to take
 Sirius.  So I float over to a good escorting position, e.g. between Dra
 and Sir, and even though I'm in the flimsiest ship I can still stop an
 ogger from flying over me (if I have fuel).  Sometimes I'll even do my
 waiting on my own front line like a space controller; I admit that
 scouts are the worst ship for dogfighting, but every little bit helps.
 Of course, the other way to escort as a scout bomber is to fake.  I'm
 fond of cloaking and going about warp 8 (so as to imitate a non-scout)
 on my way past the front.  I'll do this even if there aren't any
 particular carriers that I'm trying to help (I usually can't keep track
 of them anyway).

 Anti-scout warfare is not new.  The second day I was scout bombing on
 bronco (and people around here say that I invented the role), Exxon
 Valdez was on the other team and spent a lot of time intercepting and
 killing me.  At the time I was very happy to be occupying the time of
 such a great player, figuring that keeping Terence busy would help my
 team a lot.  Only later did I realize that Terence was taking planets
 using the kills that I provided.  Since then I've often seen
 well-meaning scout bombers truly help the opposing team by giving away
 easy kills.  Running is important.  If you're forced to run so much
 that you can't bomb at all, that's not your fault:  your team just
 needs an additional bomber.  Crippling the zero-kill anti-bomber is of
 course ideal, and I've gotten a little better at it from playing
 hockey, but it's still damn hard.

 As for the question of whether it's worth giving up a (first) kill to
 bomb two armies:  my main consideration is who is ahead in planets.  If
 my team is ahead, I'll go for the bomb.  If my team is behind, I probably
 won't.

 Detting is definitely one of the factors that distinguishes a mediocre
 player from a good player, and even to some extent a good player from a
 great player.  All the cases listed above are good examples of when you
 *might* need to det. The difference between good/great is knowing when
 you *have* to det, and when it may be better to not det.  Situations
 include escorting the carrier to the planet, and not detting a stream
 because you know the carrier will dodge them (ie...the stream is way off
 line...if it's remotely close you have to det just to be sure). Another
 case would be trying to cripple someone, or not kill counteroggers (Hi
 delbaeth :> ).  In this case, you do NOT want to det enemy torps because
 that will kill the person in most cases (you also want to make sure they
 can't end up ontop of you, but that is a different topic).  Another case
 is when you would take more damage from detting instead of dodging..but
 this is self-explanatory (though Lance seldom follows this :> ).  All
 great players det....I know of no-one who I respect as a great player
 who does not det for almost all the situations listed above.  The only
 possible exceptions are non-base players who get stuck in a base because
 of a bad situation.

 Another time to det is before you die.  Whenever I am going to die, I
 det.  This is only useful when you are in a crowd (enemies or friends)
 but I do it all the time anyway.  You'd be amazed at how much good you
 can do by using your last 10 points of hull to take out 10-20 torps.
 Not to mention the damage you inflict on the enemies who were hanging
 around.

 Anyone have any fond memories of detting ~30+ torps with only 10 hull
 left?  Its good to know that the enemies wasted about 50 torps
 killing one ship.

 >  (2 wtemp / tick, 5 ticks per second, 10 wtemp per second held down)

 It is worse than this.  Detting is one of the many activities that the
 server will allow you to do more than once per tick.  (A "tick" is the
 update of the universe that happens once every 1/10 sec.)  

 All of the most significant player actions cause the server to mark
 the shared data segment in such a way that they cannot be performed
 very often.  For instance, when you phaser, your phaser gets marked as
 PHMISS, PHHIT, or PHHIT2.  If you try to phaser again before the
 phaser expires, a check in the server code that happens BEFORE you are
 penalized fuel and wtemp will disallow another phaser shot.
 Eventually your phaser status returns to PHFREE, and then you can fire
 again.  Torpedoes, phasers, and plasmas all work this way.

 Contrast the way detting works.  Even if you have detted before in the
 same 1/10 second, you STILL are penalized the fuel and wtemp.  (In
 fact here is one of the servers many small inefficiencies: it could
 mark you as having detted this tick and thereby save itself checking
 all of the extant torpedoes for proximity to you.  As it stands, the
 server will recompute which torps are being detted as fast as your
 keyboard will autorepeat.)

 One of the big differences between a good and a great base is that a
 great base knows how to tap out a 1/10 second rhythm on the space bar
 while doing other things like phasering and torping.  You cannot
 expect for autorepeat to do this for you.  (Although it would be VERY
 useful if X would let you tune your keyboard such that autorepeat
 happens automatically on 1/10 sec intervals.  Anyone know if this is
 possible?)  To a certain extent this skill is required for great
 players, too.  But since escort ships are expendable, running out of
 fuel or wtemping them is much less of a problem.

 <lots of questions, mostly good deleted>

 Basically:

 You can only det torps.
 Detted torps to do less damage than torps that hit.  The amount of
 damage depends on how far the torps are from a ship, so the further away
 you are, the better.
 *Detted torps do NOT hurt the team-mates of the ship that detted.*
 Detted torps do NOT hurt the ship that fired them.
 *Detted torps DO hurt team-mates of the ship that fired them.*

 While you may like to dodge more than to det, there will be many times
 when you can't turn because you're going to fast, or a valuble team-mate
 can't, or dodging will put you in a bad position, or a team-mate right
 behind you will suck the torps (which will damage you anyway, and might
 kill him for still MORE damage to you. . .).  There are a lot of times
 when you might want to det.  I advise that you re-read all of the posts
 before this one for good ideas.

 Subject: helping starbase, zeroing agris
 Date: Mon, 10 May 1993 00:47:43 GMT

 Some random bits of new advice, or at least new tactical ideas for
 experienced players to think about.  These pretty much go against
 the common lore.

 (1) To help a weapon-temped starbase, dock on it!  I often see a
 starbase survive the first og wave without taking much damage but
 weapon-temp, and then its escorts hover around out of fuel but afraid
 to dock to the starbase because there are oggers coming, perhaps even
 an enemy already in range.  Don't be so afraid to dock!  If you just
 hover there out of fuel, the first ogger in will do like 800 points of
 damage because nobody can kill him or det his torps.  If you dock, you
 can get the fuel to kill the oggers, plus you can det torps for the
 base.  You'll probably blow up causing 100 points of damage to the
 base, but that's small potatoes.  Warning:  there are drawbacks to this
 plan, the main one being that your starbase will probably foolishly
 pressor you away and then yell at you.

 (2) When you have 4 armies, don't go to try to destroy the agri in
 their space.  It's usually better to destroy a non-agri planet.  Why?
 Because if you drop an agri to zero, they have only to put 1 army on it
 for it to pop back to 4 very quickly.  So they undo your hard work very
 easily, plus they get the bonus that then your team has to touch that
 planet.  Also, there's a good chance you'll get only some of your
 armies down before dying, or else the planet might pop while you beam.
 You get no partial credit for reducing agris, whereas reducing
 non-agris is very valuable.  Of course if it's not going to be so easy
 for them to drop the 1 army, or if it's the most open planet, then go
 for it.  I just don't like to see my team put all its effort into
 destroying an enemy core agri when there are easier and more
 appropriate targets we could go for.

 Subject: working with starbases
 Date: Tue, 22 Jun 1993 19:26:44 GMT

 I've been playing a lot of starbases in pickup games the last few weeks,
 and I'm constantly annoyed to see team members do dumb things because
 they think it will help me.  I almost always play a fighting base; I
 bring it up to around the center of our front line, and establish "space
 control."  E.g. I become an obstacle to enemy oggers; if an ogger is
 chasing carrier on my team, the carrier can fly across my zone of death
 and I'll nail the ogger if he follows.  Also I can occasionally clear
 planets, more rarely defend attacked planets, and the enemies tend to
 waste some time and throw away some ships with kills in their efforts to
 kill me.  I'll beam up armies from the front too, but I always prefer to
 have planet-takers use my armies ASAP.  (Note that there is another
 style of base play in which its main purpose is to protect the army
 hoard on the homeworld, but in my opinion that's wasting the base's
 firepower, and anyway it's boring.)

 Dumb things you guys do as my teammates include:

 (1) Shuttling armies to me.  This is almost always an incredibly stupid
 thing to do.  Your ship can use those armies to take a planet.  Mine
 cannot.  So don't transfer them to me!  Take (or reduce, or reinforce)
 planets instead.  Yes, there are rare situations where shuttling is a
 good play, e.g. if there are several planets around with 6 armies each,
 and you have a scout with a kill, you can quickly shuttle a few armies
 to me and then use the last two armies you pick up.  But most of the
 time it's just plain dumb to put armies on a starbase.

 (2) Hanging around "defending" me from oggers when you could be off
 taking a planet.  Look, you're an og target, and I'm an og target, so we
 should SEPARATE.  Go off and try to take a planet.  Probably half the
 oggers will go to stop you, and that will save my ass much more
 effectively than having you fly in circles near me.  Plus which, if you
 hang around I will do my best to keep you alive, detting for you etc,
 because that's the base's job, so your presence is very likely to get me
 hurt.  Anyway, the idea of the game is to take planets.

 (3) Offering me a tow.  Almost always a waste of time.  Particularly
 annoying is when you get behind me (relative to the oggers) in hopes
 that I'll tractor you and pull myself to safety.  Get in front, between
 me and the oggers, and maybe I'll pressor off of you.  In general, I
 pull and push on friendly ships all the time, usually to shove them in
 the direction they're headed already, in order to speed them up.  If
 you're coming towards me I'll almost always pull you in.  Please don't
 misinterpret this as meaning that I want a tow, and turn around!  I will
 generally never tractor an friendly ship that is moving away from me, or
 pressor a friendly ship that is trying to move towards me.  (Well, maybe
 for a second in order to dodge a stream of torps...)

 (4) Hanging around waiting for a safe time to dock.  The last thing I
 need is to have to protect you for a long time while you're low on fuel
 or hurt, the whole time trying to guess what it is that you want.  Just
 bloody dock to me, if that's what you're here for.  I'll det the torps
 (you can too).

 (5) Protecting the base at the expense of bombing or planet-taking
 activities.  If you want to help me, do the things I can't do, i.e.
 attack enemy planets.  When I get hurt, I will retreat and repair, and I
 feel bad because I'm not fighting at the front, but don't compound the
 problem by hanging back with me!  If you want to help me, start by doing
 what I ask.  E.g. if I'm begging the team to go bomb, don't expect me to
 be grateful to you for hanging around "escorting" me when you could be
 bombing!

 Also, use phasers to shoot oggers, not torps so much.  Three reasons:
 (1) good players will dodge torps, but they can't dodge phasers, (2)
 your exploding torpedos can hurt me (and other ships on our team), and
 (3) a phaser hit on a cloaker shows its location.  This actually goes
 for all aspects of netrek; good players use phasers, bad players use
 torps.  (Which in turn explains why DDs are good for use by twinks
 against other twinks, but aren't effective fighters in high-clue games.)

 This is a fighting SB that is probably in an even game.  When you are  
 down, it is very useful to save every army you can.  This often means  
 shuttling to the base rather than taking or reducing planets.

 I think bert is referring to a mostly even game, where he sits on the  
 front and you could just as easily drop the armies on an enemy planet as  
 you could drop them on him.

 Unforunately most bases don't feel this way.  I guess the most important  
 thing is "know your base".  Some bases are religous about not docking  
 under fire, others don't care.

 Again, if you're losing, the base is more of an asset than it is on the  
 front (well, probably:).  Sometimes its worth that extra minute of  
 protection to ensure your army supply.

 OK.  I think I posted this before but I have added some stuff.  Now I
 have to work out how to include the stuff in Red Shirt's latest posting...

 Any comments appreciated.


 MAKING USE OF YOUR STARBASE

 Here is some advice for people playing on my team while I'm basing.
 Most of it is be applicable to other bases too.  It is NOT a guide
 to basing (see Balton's playing-sb for that).

 **Ask not what you can do for your base, but what your base can do for you**

 I base to help my team win.  My primary purpose is normally to store and
 protect armies, but there are other things I can do, both for the team
 and for you individually.  

 Armies:

 Do not ask me whether I have armies or not.  I will regularly send
 army count calls, either when the number changes or when the last message
 has scrolled of my team message window (which is about 8 lines long).

 When picking armies up off me do not worry about incoming torps.  I will
 det them for you and you should take no damage.  It's probably best not
 to try to pick up of me in the middle of an ogg wave though.  If an 
 ogger is after you your best bet is to get behind me and let me try to find 
 him with a torp spread or phaser-lock.

 If we have lots of planet bound armies and you can't use them all
 (only one kill maybe), it may be a good idea to ferry them to me so that
 they will be safe from SC bombers.  Remember that I have a carrying
 capacity of 25 armies.  It is probably best not to ferry to me when I
 am doing space control on the front line.

 Kills:

 If you are looking for some kills and I am in the action, then hanging
 around me is a good way to get some.  I will do my best to give kills
 away (they are no use to me) by holding people down with my tractors/
 pressors and softening them up so you can nail them.  However I do not
 like having enemies nearby and shooting at me, so try to get them fast.
 You will find that ships that have been struggling with base tractors
 for any length of time will tend to be short of fuel.

 (Sometimes my ogg reflexes take over and I will phaser a half dead scout
 just before you get him.  I'm working on it...) 

 Logistics:

 You can refit (to a different ship type) on a starbase.  You can refuel
 and repair on a base.  So a base is like a mobile home planet!  There is
 the additional advantage that my firepower tends to deter enemies from
 approaching.  If you are on my tactical and need help fast (eg you are
 80% damaged), toggle your shields on-off-on-off-... and I will try to
 tractor you in.  (If you are coming in to pick up armies you can get me
 to speed up your run in in the same way.) 

 If I am being ogged then do not try to use me as a base.  There are
 likely to be a lot of torps flying/ships exploding, and you will do a
 lot of damage to me if you blow up while docked.  

 Boosting:  

 If I am around our home planet/entry point, I will use tractors and/or 
 pressors to give you a boost towards the front line.  I try to be careful
 not to get this wrong, but I will probably send you the wrong way sometimes.


 LOOKING AFTER YOUR STARBASE

 Since a base is such a useful thing to have, it is worth investing some
 effort in keeping it!  Mostly I can look after myself, but there are some
 situations when I appreciate support.  The first is when they are trying
 to ogg me.  This will usually involve waves of 4+ ships coming in
 cloaked.  One or two escorts can do a lot of damage to an ogg wave on
 the way in, especially if they are good at phaser-locking (hitting 
 cloaked ships with phasers).

 The best thing you can do here is to use the numerical advantage the ogg
 should give our team to take their planets.  (If you genocide them they 
 can't ogg me :) But if you do get a chance to hassle someone who is coming 
 to ogg me by all means do so!  Forcing them to use fuel dodging and/or 
 cloaking early will reduce the time they have to plan their approach and/or 
 the amount of stuff they can shoot at me.  

 Towing:

 It is important to get the base to where it can be of the most use as
 fast as possible.  A base can move much faster with the assistance of
 another ship and tractors or pressors.  Procedure for towing a base is to
 move over the base in the direction of movement while the base tractors
 you (you will etemp fast if you do the tractoring).  If there is more
 than one ship then the others can tractor me themselves, however do not
 ever tractor me unless you are sure I want it - it is particularly
 annoying not being able to orbit a planet because someone is tractoring
 you.  If I want a tow I may flash my shields to request one.  

 Close escorting your base:

 I do appreciate escorts when I'm being ogged, but two close escorts is
 the most I would ever need/expect except when seriously damaged/crippled.

 Do not fire torps over the base - cloaked enemy ships can det them on me, 
 and I may be waiting for a cloaked ship to uncloak so I can pressor him
 away from me before killing him.  Try to phaser lock cloaked ships/catch
 them with a torp spread - even if you only score one hit it will give me
 something to target the base's heavy phasers on.  

 If there are uncloaked ships firing at me from a distance, you should
 det the torps for me (fly alongside and hit "det torps" repeatedly) -
 with practise you can det a lot of torps without taking much damage.
 Detting torps is particularly important when several ships are firing at
 me at once - I can usually dodge a torp spread from one ship without
 collecting more than one or maybe two torps.

 The other purpose of a close escort is to give me something to
 tractor/pressor myself off.  A base can improve its manoevourability
 greatly by doing this, and that matters a lot when dodging torps or
 cloaked incoming ships.  

 The Advanced Base:

 If it is necessary to hold a critical front-line planet, or clear a
 critical front-line planet for a take, or front line space control is 
 needed, the base will often move forward.  Under these circumstances it 
 is very exposed, and may need support in a hurry if the enemy try to ogg
 it.

 The Crippled Base:

 If the base is crippled (moving at warp 1), then the most important
 thing is to get it to a repair planet as fast as possible.  So a tow
 should be organised (the base can still use tractors and pressors fine).
 If more than one ship wants to help then pressoring is slightly better
 than tractoring as it puts you between me and potential oggers.  The
 critical thing if a crippled base is being attacked is to kill the enemy
 ships before they get close enough to do any damage (counter ogging).  
 It is essential to try and phaser lock cloaked ships and uncloaked ships 
 firing from a distance should have their torps detted (it's much harder 
 to dodge at warp 1 than at warp 2) and be killed as quickly as possible.

 The Wtemped Base:

 The major constraint on a good base's survival is his wtemp limit rather
 than his hull/shields.  If I send a distress call and don't appear damage,
 it may be because I am wtemped (look for the W in the call) or close
 to wtemped (the message will give the percentage).  A wtemped base cannot
 use its weapons or det (but can T/P).  The most vital thing when trying to 
 protect a wtemped base is to stop enemies getting near it and to kill
 anyone who uncloaks on top of it real fast (don't worry about the explosion
 doing damage, multiple torps will do far more).  If you are out of fuel
 you might want to dock with me and use my fuel (since I can't).  (NOTE:
 don't do this when I am not wtemped, 'cause I will run out of fuel and
 you will blow up on me.)

 Subject: courage and cowardice
 Date: Fri, 23 Jul 1993 19:18:10 GMT

 I define courage, in netrek, as the willingness to go into enemy space
 (i.e. near their planets), especially in advance of one's teammates.
 Say the enemy Feds are down to their core, and are primarily flying
 around within that core attacking any who dare to enter it.  The player
 who leads the attack wave by entering enemy space ahead of his or her
 teammates, and then either gains temporary space control over a planet
 so a carrier can zip and drop armies, or decoys (e.g. cloaks to Vega) to
 confuse the defenders, that player has courage.  (This player is often
 a bomber, and so is doubly heroic.)

 Note that this is not the same as flying down ahead of everybody and
 mutualing with an enemy ship.  That may sound brave, and certainly
 indicates a willingness to die, but it's basically just foolish.  Dying
 isn't the goal, and so courage should not be equated with a willingness
 to die.  Get in their space, and then runner-scum your head off if you

 useless, they often actually hurt their own team in two ways:  (1) by
 killing oggers (thereby transporting them to their home planet and
 giving them fresh ships) and (2) wasting the time of brave escorts and
 decoys who are busting their balls creating openings for the cowardly
 carrier.  In the military, cowardice is traditionally a capital offense.

 Have you ever been 90%+ damaged near a planet with no fuel or repair and
 orbitted it for 180 degrees so you could take the time to repair a little
 and still move towards your home?  Or do you just trudge warp 1-2 straight
 back?  And don't say something lame like, "I usually hang around up front
 and scum 2 or 3 more kills and then head back at about 97% damage."

 i feel it's better to sit and repair than limp away at
 warp 1 or 2. i try to wait until i can move warp 4.
 also, you can use tractor/pressors while in repair mode.
 in an AS or DD, you can repair cloaked for added security.

 the tip about using a planet to swing you around is interesting,
 but it assumes you are in the process of limping away. if i see
 a guy with a kill struggling toward his home world, i tend to
 go after him. and theres nothing to stop the guy that just
 wounded you from announcing that fact on the team board.

 of course, it's almost always better to die than be left

 Sub zero asks about an orbit key:

 Sometimes I use they orbit key to dodge torps.

 For example:

 I'm dogfighting over a planet, i'm going warp 3.  I get damaged and i'm
 sitting on the center of the planet.  He fires a torp spread aimed right
 for me.  I'm too hurt to dodge.  I slow to warp 2, and hit orbit.  Often
 times, it puts me in orbit away from the torps.

 Othertimes I use it to drop on the planet when i'm not locked on.

 For example:

 I'm dogfighting a defender off the planet so I can drop armies.  He is
 runnerscumming me.  I fly over the planet towards him.  He keeps
 buttorping.  I dodge his torps, get over the planet, slow to warp 2,
 fire a stream of torps, cloak and drop.

 Both of these may also be done with the 'lock' key.  But I seem to
 recall that the behavoir is slightly different.  Also before the days of
 "lock planet" sometimes it was easy to fly over and press O rather than
 lock on(because you would accidently lock onto a player instead).  Then
 there used to be a severe orbit bug, but that's fixed now.

 I believe there is no difference in this instance between lock and
 orbit.  Here some differences I see:

 1)  If you hold down the orbit key your navigator will try to
 manuver you to the north pole (the advanced navigators have
 been removed from many servers now).

 2)  If you hold down lock you will constantly break your orbit
 (losing your bombing, beamup...), but you won't with orbit.

 3)  You can avoid locking on to non SB ships this way (of course
 there is a new lock key now).

 4)  You can keep steering and try to orbit, without ever having
 the lock on code steer your ship.

         Those who have mastered Orbiting onto a planet are about 10 times
 more effective planet takers than those who haven't.  Orbit allows a
 player more control over where and when he orbits a planet.  This allows
 players to avoid a stream of torps fired over a planet that the planet
 taker wants to drop armies on.  Used in conjunction of det enemy torps, it
 allows clueful players to have a better chance of dropping armies against
 clueful defenders.

         Ever wonder why you couldn't kill an enemy taker even though you
 are close to a planet firing torps and phasers over it?  It probably is
 because the taker is landing onto a planet in a non-predictable manner
 using orbit.  Of course, if you get a phaser lock onto the taker, then it
 doesn't matter if the taker is using orbit or lock.  Orbit helps against
 torp streams.

   Reinforcing is extremely important in almost every game.  However,
 there is a correct time to reinforce and an incorrect time.  As far as
 my opinion goes, the following are my definitions of 'correct and
 incorrect' times.

 Reinforce your planets when :
   1) You're battling over your front and the other team is slightly superior.
   2) You're battling over your core.
   3) You're battling over the enemies core and they have an agri left.
   4) You have a kill and are hurt and a planet has armies near another
 weak planet.
   5) You have more armies then them and hold their front.  Basically this
 is an inl strategy where you force them to waste armies on retaking
 their front line.

 When not to reinforce planets
   1) You feel like scumming
   2) You feel like scumming
   3) You fe.. ok ok, there *are* other reasons :)
   3) When you have a large army surplus and are retaking your space/their 
      front
   4) You have a superior team and can contest planet takes
   5) You have superior dogfighters who can hold their front until it pops
   6) You have enough kills+armies to take their agri
   7) They're down to core with no agri

   I'm sure some people have more/other reasons when they feel you should
 reinforce.  I'm also sure that some people don't even agree with some of
 my reasonings, but that's alright since I'm...

 I generally do one of two things:

 1) Go to Y (the real destination) well ahead of the take, and try to
 push enemies away from the planet, while trying to stay alive. Hopefully,
 when the carrier turns and heads for Y, the planet will be sort of open
 with me in a good position, and hopefully I can keep it open enough for
 the carrier to drop before the other nasties can make it.

 2) Go to X (the fake destination) just ahead of the carrier. It helps
 a lot of the carrier is heading *directly* towards X at high warp (I'll
 explain why below). Hopefully lots of enemies will head to X at high
 warp, thinking that they have to get there fast to stop the take. I
 then veer off to put myself between X and Y, and also try to keep
 myself between my carrier and the guys at X. Ideally the people
 rushing over to X take so long to slow down and turn around that my
 carrier has made it to Y, so that all the guys at X are out of the
 picture.
 If we seem to have enough people at Y to clear it, then I stay near to
 X and try to hold back those guys as much as I can. If we don't seem
 to have enough clearers at Y, then I try to run over there really fast,
 hoping that I can quickly clear it so that the carrier can drop before
 the enemies coming from X can make it.


 The reason it helps for the carrier to head *directly* at the planet
 is that the human eye is very good at picking out linear features from
 any set of data. For example, if you take some points in a line and mix
 in a bunch of random points, it's still easy to pick out the line unless
 the density of random points is really high.

 In other words, if the carrier is headed directly at the planet, then even
 if an enemy isn't paying close attention, it's quite likely that they will
 notice that the line of advancing ship positions is exactly in line with
 one of their planets. This makes it more likely that a lot of the enemies
 will see the fake attempt and respond to it.

 In general, if you want the enemy to see you going for a planet, head
 directly at it. On the other hand, if you're hoping the enemy *won't*
 see you, it's a good strategy to aim for a point a little away from
 the planet, and then change direction when you get close. If the enemy
 is distracted, it's amazing how well this can work, you can walk right
 up to an enemy planet with armies without them getting suspicious. Of
 course, against clued opposition it's often the case that they are
 already tracking you as a carrier, so acting nonchalant just isn't
 going to help, but even in clue games you can still get away with it
 if enemies are paying attention to something else.

 >   Anyway, what other stategies are used to get the last planet?

 First off try and get the defenders away from the home planet.  If your
 team has 2 carriers, and a lot of defenders go to ogg one of them, let
 that carrier run, and do not kill the enemies.  Your team should
 concentrate on helping the other carrier drop.  With 19 planets, your
 team does not have to drop a decent percentage.

 A base can be helpful for you team, so you can refuel, and have a
 protected place.  However, if the other team oggs your base while your
 team is trying to take, concentrate on helping the taker - the purpose
 is not to save the base, but rather take the last planet.

 If they are ogging a lot, faster ships (such as a scout) are good.  They
 can get around the oggers leaving the oggers away from the homeworld, so
 the carrier can take.  Remember, try not to kill oggers that are behind
 the taker and probably won't be able to effect the take.

 If they are not ogging much, a lot of hull can help the taker.  An AS,
 while rather obvious, takes a lot of damage to kill, which can make the
 difference between getting down an army, or not.

 People helping the taker should concentrate on getting the better enemy
 phaser lockers out of action.  If the other team's good defenders are
 out of fuel, keep them that way.  Also, defenders orbiting the homeworld
 can fire a lot more - these are good targets.  Sometimes it is important
 to kill the enemies with plasma.  Other times these players run from
 real take attempts - so scare them away, and then deal with other
 enemies.Teamates that cloak, to fake taking, and det a lot are helpful
 too.  Still the most helpful are ones that just keep enemies far away
 from the homeworld.  Unfortunately, most pickup games have players that
 do the exact opposite and kill the enemies that are far away from the
 home planet, while their team is trying to take the home planet -- these
 players can be the other team's MVP's.

         Actually a good skill to use in this case is "maiming" your
 opponents.  You don't want to kill people because that brings them in
 right where you start out.  On the other hand, you don't want them
 following you in and blasting your take from the back side.  Just get
 the enemy to warp 3-4 and you should do fine.

         Try not to leave the home planet for the LPS.  It's the hardest
 to take. (except for core agri's... I dont really consider a core agri
 an LPS anyway, since it won't be for long)

         Choose the LPS area when the enemy is down to 6 planets.  

         Choose the LPS planet when the enemy is at 3 or 4 planets.

         Make sure your choices are at least reasonable. (i.e. ORG really
 isn't a good choice for a FED LPS since no clue would defend it.)

 I think the most important thing to get the last planet is to have
 some synchronization on your team. What screws most LPS breaking
 attempts is that at any one time, you have 3 people scumming kills,
 3 people either picking up or ogging, and 2 people carrying to the
 home planet. So, what happens is a clue goes out, kills one of the
 people picking up, dies to a kill scum, and then reappears at the
 homeworld in time to kill one of the carriers coming in.

 To take the last planet, you have to have some sense of what the other
 people on your team are doing, and try to work with them. If someone
 on your team is almost at the planet, obviously the worst thing you
 can do is teleport a good player home. Of course, when that good
 player is charging you with shields down trying to run into your torps,
 it's hard to remember that.

 This is why scums hate LPS, because they never bother to think about
 anyone but themselves, and so they are completely helpless in LPS
 since it's very hard to do anything useful by yourself.

 It's generally a good idea to try to draw enemies away from the last
 planet. In fact, it can be useful to completely run away for a while,
 so that the defenders get bored and move out away from their last
 planet a bit.

 It's usually a good idea to get multiple carriers, because that makes
 life much harder for the good defenders. If there's only one person
 carrying, then the good player can chase them all over the galaxy,
 while if there are multiple carriers, then he has to stay near the
 homeworld to make sure one doesn't sneak in behind him. If you are
 carrying, and a good player comes after you, the best thing you can
 do is try to get him to chase you, and live as long as you can so
 that your teammates can take the planet while the good player is away
 (and don't kill him! since you're just a decoy anyway, give your
 teammates as much time as possible, make him fly all the way home).

 I usually don't pick a planet for the LPS. You always want to try to
 get the core agri when they are at 4 planets or so, and it's nice to
 try to pick off the homeworld, but I'm usually happy with any of the
 other three core planets for the LPS. If you take too long being choosy,
 it's too likely for them to get some armies and retake their core agri,
 which makes your life a lot harder. Many times it can be useful to
 leave one of the planets neutral, so that they might defend it, and
 if they get armies they might take the neutral instead of trying for
 the core agri (it's a lot easier to retake a random planet in the core
 than an agri).

 One of my favorite plans for attacking LPS is the frisbee plan (it
 works a lot better if the LPS isn't fuel). Have everyone (or most
 everyone) on your team get a kill and pick up armies, preferably
 in a big ship like an assault. Once you have your kill, run away from
 oggers (preferably towards a teammate, so he can scum a kill too).

 Once about 5 or 6 people have armies, have everyone cloak and run
 to the enemy last planet. First run around in circles for a while
 until the twinks waste all their fuel, then go in for the planet one
 at a time (send in the decoys first!). It will be a slaughterhouse
 as the clue slice one carrier after another, but as long as you avoid
 exploding on each other the clue just doesn't have enough fuel to
 kill everyone, and eventually one of the assaults gets on the planet
 and the great defender doesn't have enough fuel to kill you before you
 drop your armies.

 The best part about it is that it's entertaining enough that you
 can convince your team to go for it. Everybody loves the frisbee
 plan :-) It doesn't work so well if the LPS is fuel (because the
 enemy can orbit the fuel planet and fire)..you have to have someone
 uncloak and ogg the guys orbitting the planet (but, on the other hand,
 if you can kill one of them then the explosions should take down all
 of them). Still, against a good defense it can work as well as anything
 else.

 Subject: Re: Custer's Last stand tactics....

 The basic method for defending a LPS is brute force space control.  In
 other words, take a CA and clobber the shit out of the nearest ship to
 your home planet, dying in the process.  (You have to die because it's
 the fastest way of refueling and repairing.)  Or alternatively take a BB
 and do the same.  BBs are probably better for beginners to do this in;
 experienced people will want the CA since it's more versatile.

 The theory is simple.  If the enemy can't live in your space, they
 can't:

         1) take planets

         2) escort

         3) bomb

 Since you are fighting close to your home planet, the enemy takes
 longer to get back to the scene of the action than you do.  This is the
 immense innate advantage of the LPS defender, and the way to use the
 advantage is massive slaughter.

 The only problem is that you're on a team of twinks who got themselves
 into LPS in the first place.  Which means you might be better off just
 guarding the damn last planet.  You might be the only one who can do it
 properly.

 If there are two of you, great.  You can play 'hammer and anvil'.  The
 anvil sits on the last planet and kills incomers.  The hammer goes out
 and attacks.  Hammer is a slightly harder (more fun) job since if done
 well no single attack will get past the hammer undamaged.  But do
 cooperate.  Two anvils, or two hammers, are worse than one hammer plus
 one anvil.  It doesn't take two to cooperate, either.  It only takes
 one.  Just have a look at what your one competent teammate is doing,
 and do the opposite.  You don't even need to send messages.

 The hammer should know about space control.  When there are no carriers
 he should do space control pure and simple: kill 'em all and let God
 sort 'em out.  When there are carriers, things get more complicated.
 Actually when there is one carrier it's not so bad.  The algorithm is:

         1.  Attack the carrier.

         2.  If the carrier is escorted, kill the escorts first.

         3.  If anybody gets in the way, he is considered an escort.

 When there are two or more carriers, things are messier.  Consider this
 scenario:

         Three carriers are incoming.  Two enemy ships are escorting one
         of the carriers.  You have a good 'anvil' at the last planet,
         and everybody else is clueless.  You have about 20 seconds to
         do whatever you want before everybody arrives.

 So... what on earth to do?  Outnumbered 5 to 2...nice odds!  We pause
 ten seconds for station identification:
 
 
 This is the netrek clue network.
 

 Certainly you should not ogg one of the unescorted ships.  A few people
 are dumb enough to do such a thing.  But what will probably happen is
 that your target will run.  Then your anvil will be left alone against a
 doubly escorted carrier, who will have every chance of taking the
 planet.

 Perhaps ogg the escorted ship?  No!  His escorts will prevent it; at
 worst they will cripple you and leave you behind, sweeping in to the
 planet, blowing away the anvil, and taking it.

 Perhaps wait at the last planet?  Uh uh.  The two escorts will have a
 reasonable chance of killing both you and the anvil; then the carriers
 will get through.  At least one will drop armies.

 I claim there's only one decent solution: ogg one of the escorts.
 Reappear at the home planet before the wave arrives.  There, it'll be
 two of you against one escort.  The escort will ogg one of you, and the
 other, fully fueled and ready, can have some fun with the three
 now-unescorted carriers.  Holding off three unescorted carriers is well
 within the realm of what a clueful player can do.  Especially since he
 only has to hold them off long enough for you to reappear.

 Pfah.

 One of the principal points of being clueful is that you can die whenever
 you want to.  If you're trying to put the heat on an escorted ship with
 10 seconds before it gets on the planet, then get in its way and walk
 in generating damage with your shields up.  Within a few microseconds,
 the escorts -- who are probably not robotically synchronized -- will both
 attempt to maximize your damage.  If they guess wrong and don't hurt
 you enough, you have a good shot at locking the carrier and disrupting
 the entire thing.  Knowing this, most escorts try to generate a lot of
 damage at first.  Fire a lot.  Drop shields.  Det.  Now you probably
 have two low-fuel escorts and a carrier moving at less than maxwarp,
 which translates into up to an entire second of advantage.  Good god,
 it's like having free beer and blowjobs.

 Unlike most gedankenexperiments presented in this group, this tactic
 actually works a whole lot.  It works against Superior Firepower, for
 instance.  Hi guys.

 If you and the other guy choose to die simultaneously, then yeah, you
 have extreme brain damage and should be genocided.  However, the joy
 of last-ditch planet defense is that you get free ships every three or
 four seconds as well as a free teleport somewhere near the action.  And
 nothing except stupidity will make two ships die simultaneously to two
 attacking (i.e. moving forward rapidly) ships which have travelled most
 of the way across the galaxy.  3 carriers with 2 escorts against two
 defenders is about the best you could hope for as a defender.  All those
 excess carriers!  Free ships every so often!  One place to be!

 I was thinking Passchendaele, myself.

 Real players play scouts on the defense in LPSes.  I predicted scoutbombing
 would rule when I first started; I predicted scoutdropping would rule
 shortly thereafter; I predicted space control with the original 12AM;
 and now I'm predicting formations with deep safeties.  You heard it here
 first.  Accept no substitute prophecies.  Scouts.  LPS defense.

 I disagree (and agree with Tom). Sure you can't stop the enemy from
 getting armies, but a good bomber can wipe out enough armies to make
 it more difficult for the attacking team to pick up, particularly if
 you bomb nearby planets so that enemy carriers have to fly a long way
 to get armies. Also, if the attacking is trying to use multiple carriers
 (a good strategy) then bombing can slow this up enough for you to og
 one of the carriers before all ofthem are ready.

 If you're the best phaser locker on your team, it's not such a great

 much prefer it when I can just pick up whereever and whenever I want.

 I disagree again. I hesitate to say "be aggressive", because that seems
 to imply charging at maxwarp towards enemies, which is only really useful
 against low clue opponents. However, it's a lose to sit around in your
 core; this gives the enemy free license to cruise through your space
 with impunity. You have to get forward of your planets and punish anyone
 who tries to pass (while leaving 1-2 people back home as guards). This way,
 the enemy carriers have to go to a lot of trouble to get to your core
 planets, and it's unlikely for them to have significant escort.

 You have to keep your space clear, so that you have room to move around
 and time to react to enemy carriers incoming. If you don't do this,
 enemy carriers can sit near to your planets and wait for a good
 opportunity, which will eventually come (note that this whole discussion
 applies equally well to a front line battle).

 > > 3) TAKE AGRIS.

 In particular, assuming you have two planets (and thus don't desparately
 need one to stop the timer) save up for the agri, even if another planet
 is available (including your home planet!). Getting your core agri is
 *the* one and only goal of a LPS-type defense. Once you have that agri,
 just hold it and everything else will fall into place.

 A lot of people say silly things like "it's harder to defend, we should
 take something closer to our homeworld." (Like, say Hydrae is agri and
 Drac is not). It doesn't matter if the agri is harder to defend, because
 agris defend themselves. Usually the strategy for attacking the core is
 to drop anywhere and attrition the planets; this doesn't work with agris.
 You have to drop all four at once, or you gain nothing.

 It's a lot easier to drop two armies on the home planet than 4 armies
 on a core agri. I should know :)

 One other thing. It's very dangerous to leave one of your last planets
 at 5 (particularly your agri). This is because it's easy for the attacking
 team to assault bomb it to 1 or 2, which is better than your average
 drop (and a classic way to lose your agri to a 1 kill carrier). If
 your team isn't so hot at stopping bombers, I often think it's better
 to just pick up the army and try to hold it (even if you lose it, you
 don't also lose a lot more). If the planet has 6 armies, it's probably
 better to leave them there; at 7, the best thing is to load them on an
 assault ship and go looking for a good bomb (25% chance of bombing a
 planet from 5 to less than 3 with an assault).

 Getting to the planet ahead of the carrier is to be commended, as is
 detting.  But I'm not sure why you'd cloak while waiting.  The usual
 brute-force plan is for the escort to establish space control over the
 planet by dogfighting.  You don't have to kill the enemies; that
 would usually cost too much fuel.  Just dodge their torps, and fire
 at any enemies reckless enough to charge towards you.  Phaser-lock
 that cloaked-ogger that tries to rush in at the last minute.  And
 save a couple hundred fuel for the det.  If you do run out of fuel,
 stop moving and you'll generate the 100 fuel for one last suicidal det
 very quickly.  "Detting like mad" may not be the way to do it;
 in most cases I only need to press det once or twice.  The carrier
 will probably det too, if she's good.

 Okay, so maybe there are many defenders (or one large one like a
 starbase), so many that the dogfight plan wouldn't work, because they'd
 slaughter you quickly and easily before the carrier arrives.  Is that
 why you cloak?  (If you cloak because you don't want to attract
 attention, that's usually a mistake.)  You're outgunned and brute force
 is unlikely to work, so you might try trickery; e.g., try being
 a decoy, threatening the next planet over or something.  Or you 
 could clear some other less crowded planet and hope the carrier is
 sensible enough to switch targets.

 Subject: Exploding ships

 Um, I suggest those who really care about such things look at the source
 file ntserv/daemonII.c (get sources via anonymous ftp from
 scam.berkeley.edu).  The maximum damage an exploding DD/CA/BB/AS does is
 100 (all other ships with centers within one shield radius take maximum
 damage).  The exploding SC maximum is 75, and the exploding SB maximum
 is 200.

 For ships within 1 to about 8.5 shield radii away the damage falls off
 lineary from maximum to zero.  I'm not sure how big 8.5 shield radii is,
 but I'd say the bitmap for an SB explosion is about 4-6 radii.  The
 blast radius is the same for all ship classes.  And, just for your
 information, a SC is just as "big" as a BB as far as a torp is
 concerned, whether or not shields are up.

 The damage done by a ship explosion goes like this:

 - if the ship is within your shield radius, full damage (see above)

 - if the ship is outside your shield, but within SHIPDAMDIST (which
         is the same for all ships, about a third of the way to the
         edge of the tactical display) then damage is
         (full damage) * (SHIPDAMDIST - dist) / (SHIPDAMDIST - shieldradius)

 So, the "explosion damage range" is the same for all ships, it's just the
 damage for each ship type that varies.  Note that this is all in the
 standard distribution -- your mileage may vary, depending on server hacks.

 Long nerdy post alert!

 I was browsing through the netrek server code and thought I'd summarise
 some of the lesser known facts about the game.  Note that any of this
 may have been changed on your server, and that I've probably made an
 error or three.  (So if you really need to settle a bet, look at the
 source.)

 I was going to post the ship stats from getship.c, but Spaceman Spiff
 beat me to it by a few hours, thanks Jonathan.  Here are few lines
 to add to his table, gleaned from other parts of the code:

                         SC      DD      BB      AS      SB      CA
 shield cost             2       3       3       3       6       3
 torpedo wpn temp        7       11      26      17      20      18
 phaser wpn temp         52      59      105     56      96      70
 plasma wpn temp         --      142     307     --      292     292

 Note that these weapon temps are in tenths, relative to what you see on
 the client's display.

 Other things that might be interesting to figure out include:
         Fuel used at max warp, per second, including what you recharge.
         Total amount of damage you can possibly do with one tank of fuel.
         Time to get from one home world to another without overheating, and
         how much fuel you'd have left.
         Expected number of armies bombed from a planet that starts at 30.

 Some slightly interesting #defined constants from defs.h:

 MAXTORP 8
 MAXPLASMA 1
 GWIDTH 100000         /* galaxy is 100000 spaces on a side */
 WARP1 20              /* warp one will move 20 spaces per update */
 SCALE 40              /* Window will be one pixel for 20 spaces */
 EXPDIST 350           /* At this range a torp will explode */
 DAMDIST 2000          /* At this range a torp does damage */
 SHIPDAMDIST 3000      /* At this range, an exploding ship does damage */
 PLASDAMDIST 2500      /* At this range, a plasma does damage */
 DETDIST 1600          /* At this range a torp can be detonated */
 PHASEDIST 6000        /* At this range a player can do damage with phasers*/
 ENTORBDIST 900        /* At this range a player can orbit a planet */
 ORBDIST 800           /* A player will orbit at this radius */
 ORBSPEED 2            /* This is the fastest a person can go into orbit */
 PFIREDIST 1500        /* At this range a planet will shoot at a player */
 UPDATE 100000         /* Update time is 100000 micro-seconds */
 SBFUELMIN 10000       /* If starbase's fuel is less than this, it will not
                          refuel docked vessels */
 TRACTDIST   6000      /* maximum effective tractor beam range */
 TRACTEHEAT  5         /* ammount tractor beams heat engines */
 TRACTCOST   20        /* fuel cost of activated tractor beam */

 More random facts (?) I noted in the code:

 A "tick" is 1/10 of a second.  Most of the cost constants above are per tick.
 (So 10 updates per second makes a lot more sense than 9).

 It looks like the duration of a torpedo's flight is the torpfuse plus a
 random 1-20 ticks.  Only thing is, that means a starbase's torps should
 only go the same distance as a destroyer's; is this true?

 Phasers hit if the beam passes within EXPDIST of a ship or within EXPDIST/4
 of a plasma.

 Phaser range is proportional to phaserdamage.

 Phaser damage is multiplied by (1 - dist / phrange), i.e. drops off linearly.

 Every tick, your ship's speed is added to etemp, and you lose warpcost*speed
 in fuel.  There's additional cost if you're a SB moving with docked ships.

 When etemp goes over maxegntemp, there's a 1/40 chance (per tick) of getting
 an overheat lasting 100 + random()%150 ticks.  Which is why I still have to
 wait a few seconds after my scout cools to 0 before I can move.  Weapon
 temperature works the same way.  Detonating heats weapons by 20 (remember
 it looks like 2 to the client) regardless of whether there's anything to det.

 I couldn't figure out what happens when you try to tractor a docked ship, or
 tractor when you yourself are docked.  We'll have to experiment.  You can
 instantly pull somebody out of orbit, of course.  When you tractor or are
 tractored, the change in your position is tractor strength divided by your
 mass; it doesn't depend on the other ship's mass.

 Adding fuel (every tick):
         In orbit around friendly fuel planet, 8 * recharge.
         Else if docked on a starbase with at least SBFUELMIN, you take
         12 * recharge from the SB.
         Else 2 * recharge.

 Repairing (every tick):
         If in repair mode
                 shields gain repair * 4, in thousandths.
                 If in orbit around friendly repair planet another repair * 4.
                 If docked repair * 6.
         Else repair * 2.
         Hull damage is same way, but repairs half as fast.

 Yellow alert range is GWIDTH/7.
 Red alert range is GWIDTH/10.

 The "seen" flag is set if you are within GWIDTH/7 (or GWIDTH/3 if
 uncloaked) of a player (not robot) of any other team, unless in orbit
 around planet you don't own (includes third-party planets).  This is
 what determines whether they see you on the galactic map (even as ??).
 So avoid yellow alerts when you really want to be sneaky.  If it's
 not t-mode everybody sees you regardless.

 You take no damage from your own torps.  (Plasma is different.)

 If a teammate dets an enemy torp it doesn't hurt you at all.

 Damage from a torp you det is multiplied by (2000 - dist)/1650.
 Which means if you det it at 1600 (the best you can do), it will do
 24.2% damage.  This is independent of ship class.

 You can get hurt or killed by your own teammate's torps (or the torps
 of a mutually peaceful ship) if they explode on somebody else.  

 You get 1 + 0.1 * (A + K) kills for offing a K-kill ship carrying A armies.

 Ships blowing up:  Starbase does 200, scouts 75, others 100.  If the ship
 is farther than 350 away, this damage is multiplied (3000-dist)/2650.  Ships
 that quit don't hurt.

 You get to bomb every 5 ticks.  It rolls a number 0-99, and you get:
         0-49:   nothing
         50-79:  1 army
         80-89:  2 armies
         90-99:  3 armies.
         21-99:  if assault ship, one additional army.
 Doesn't look like this jibes with figures jch posted, so maybe I'm wrong.

 Also every 5 ticks the planet will fire on you, if you're hostile and within
 the 1500 planetary fire range.  The damage is 2 + pl_armies/10, truncated
 to an integer.

 Every 400 ticks (40 seconds) the planets all have a chance to "pop".
         If random()%3000 < pl_armies, plague losing random() % pl_armies.
         If < 4 armies, 1/20 chance of pl_armies++.
         If agri, pl_armies++ always.
         1/10 chance pl_armies += (random % 3) + 1.
         If agri, 1/5 chance of additional pl_armies++.
 This appears to mean that there are 40 seconds interludes in which you can
 be sure that nothing will pop, not even that 1 army agri world.  I find this
 difficult to believe; maybe I'm missing something.

 You can beam an army every 8 ticks.

 Send me corrections and additional trivia, and I'll post another compilation.

    it's with torps.  The figures above are with the best strategy for the
ship.

 ** There's some chance of overheating the engines doing this in a destroyer.
    Add a little extra time (I'm not sure how much, maybe a second) to avoid
    this.  I've deducted 900 distance for orbit radius, and factored in the
    acceleration and deceleration times.

 Yes, I think you're right, and I misread the code, so the bombing
 numbers I posted (weeks ago) are wrong.  That code is so unnecessarily
 messy.  Here's my interpretation now, maybe I have it right now, maybe not:

 You get to bomb every 5 ticks.  It rolls a number 0-99, and you get:
          0-49:  nothing
         50-79:  1 army, or 2 if you're an assault ship
         80-89:  2 armies, or 3 if you're an assault ship
         90-99:  3 armies, or 4 if you're an assault ship

 So normal ships bomb on average 1.6 armies per second, and
 assault ships bomb on average 2.6 armies per second.
 Corrected simulation results:

 Time, starting at 30    10.1    11.6    13.7    16.0    10.3    (seconds)
 ===============================================================
 * The LD-50 (stands for Lethal Dose) is the most number of armies the
 planet can start with and still allow the ship a 50% chance of flattening
 it.  The ship will average about 85% damage if it lives.

 What this also means is that assault ships do best when bombing planets
 with odd numbers of armies.  Here's some more data on that:

 Planet starts with:  5      6      7      8      9      10     11     12
 A.S. bombs it to:    2.4    3.4    2.8    3.3    2.9    3.25   2.95   3.2

 In particular, if a planet has 6 armies, you're best off using a scout or
 something to bomb it to 5, and then bring in the assault ship.  In most
 cases it's probably not worth the extra time to do maneuvers like that,
 but I might do it sometimes just for fun.

 I tested it, and it's true, an assault ship can't bomb just 1 army.
 You can watch the army count as you bomb a planet from 50 to 3 or
 whatever, and the jumps are all two or more.  So yeah, next time
 I'm in an assault ship with 4 armies and going to take a planet that has
 5 armies, I won't peek at the planet between bombing and beaming like
 I used to do, because I know I'll take it.  (Especially once I've
 got that 40 second timer to tell me when the planet can pop!)

 Ever wonder where the weapon costs came from?  Look at the following,
 it's the maximum damage each ship can do by devoting all its fuel
 production to the said weapon (by tick: 1/10sec):

                 SC      DD      CA      BB      AS

 phaser          2.29    3.14    3.43    2.80    2.86
 torp            2.29    3.14    3.43    3.11    1.67

 Nice coincidences here!
 Once again we see the BB phasers are much over-priced, and even the torps
 aren't a real bargain.  Everyone already knew the AS torps are luxury.

 Now, let's see if the BB with its large fuel tank can be a real fire tower.
 Here are the maximum damages each ship can do with its full fuel tank:

                 SC      DD      CA      BB      AS

 phaser          714     1000    1428    1400    857
 torp            714     1000    1428    1555    500

 Last point: the ships repair possibilities are the following (total
 hull+shields) each tick  (shields repair twice as fast as hull):
         
                 SC      DD      CA      BB      AS
                 .24     .30     .33     .375    .36

 So weapons have a real edge, if they don't miss.

 Useful bits of info about planet pops:
                                         armies popped in 40 seconds
                                         (average)
 Normal planet with less than 4 armies:  .2
 Normal planet with more than 4 armies:  .15
 AGRI with less than 4 armies         : 1.4
 AGRI with more than 4 armies         :  .35

 So, if you drop 2 armies on an AGRI, it will pop 1.4 armies in 40
 seconds, reducing your investment to .6 armies.  So, unless you're up
 by a lot, don't do it (newbie proverb, obviously this isn't always
 true).

 Nope. Each planet is checked once every 40 seconds for a random chance
 of producing armies. The chance depends on the type of planet, as well
 as the number of armies on it. The algorithm goes like this (if I read
 the code right):

 for non-agri planets:

 1) If the planet has less than 4 armies, there's a 5% chance of
 growing 1 army.
 2) in addition to (1), the planet has a 10% chance of growing 1-3
 armies (if the 10% chance hits, there's an equal chance to grow 1,
 2, or 3). This chance occurs no matter how many armies the planet has.

 for agri planets:

 1) If the agri has less than 4 armies, it automatically grows one,
 and has a 5% chance of growing a second.
 2) In addition to (1), the agri has a 10% chance of growing 1-3 armies
 (exactly the same way as non-agris).
 3) In addition to (1) and (2), the agri has a 20% chance of growing
 1 army.

 Thus, if I read the code right, it's possible for an agri to go from
 3 to 9 in a single pop, although that would be unlikely (0.033% chance).


 There has been some discussion about when planets should be checked
 for the chance to grow armies. The old way was to check all of the
 planets at the same time once every 40 seconds; not only does this
 produce a net traffic spike every 40 seconds, it's easy for people to
 time the pop cycle and thus know exactly when a planet might grow.

 The way the INL server does it (and a number of public servers) is
 to randomly order the 40 planets, then pick one each second and check
 it for growth. Once all 40 have been checked, reshuffle the list and
 go through again. This tends to preserve the same growth behavior while
 removing the predicting power (and the net spike).


 In addition to planet growth, there's a chance for the planet to have
 a plague which removes armies (this is to keep abandoned planets from
 growing to astronomical numbers). I won't dig up the formula, particularly
 as there are a few ways to do it, but basically the more armies there
 are on a planet, the more likely a plague will occur (they are very
 rare for the 10 or so armies you usually have on planets, but reasonably
 likely when the number gets up to 30-50 or so).

 Subject: What "DI" is.
 Cc:

 According to the authors, DI is "Destruction Inflicted."  It is simply
 your (planets+bombing+offense) ratings x (Tmode hours).

 When you a receive a promotion "on DI", it means that you could sit
 around and do nothing while waiting for the required number of hours
 and still get the promotion.

 E.g., Admiral Flatliner has only 27.19 hours while 40 hours and a ratings
 total of 8 are required for the rank.  8 x 40 = 320 DI.  Flatliner's
 ratings add up to 11.69, so 27.19 x 11.69 ~= 320.

 Note that it is possible to lose DI because your ratings are always
 relative to the global average.

 The double DI and quad DI promotions are fairly meaningless -- basically
 you can get a promotion with insufficient ratings but lots of hours.

 Subject: Definitions

     I'd like to take the time to go through definitions and explainations.

     Og:  Also Ogg, Oggg, and Ogggg (you get the idea).  To kill another
 ship by charging at him -- often cloaked without caring about your own
 death.  Ideally, if you die, your explosion should finish him off.  So
 named because Terence did this frequently with the extra ship Og.

     Genocided race planets:  Those extra 10 planets you own after killing
 off an entire race.  So called because it was noted that "Fed Space"
 wasn't really acurate if the Feds had been killed off.

     Surface Bombing: bombing outside planets, genocided race planets, and
 other undefended planets.

     Deep Bombing: bombing deep in enemy teritory.  This often involves
 cloaking, and is very important at the begining of the game.

     Runner Scum: Berkley term.  1) This refers to those who run from and
 even fight in hopes of gaining the advantage of shooting backwards.  It
 is important that this does not include running when outnumbered,
 injured, or out of fuel.  It also does not include merely attemping to
 stay at range--where a smaller ship is more effective.  Runner scum are
 looked down upon because this tactic can't be used by everyone.  If it
 were, there would be no kills.  So those who try to make the game more
 interesting get reamed. 2) also often used to descibe those who hide in
 the backfield and only fight the occational straggler.

     Ogger Scum: Those who Ogg for no understandable reason.  This does not
 include those who occationally Ogg planet takers with kills, bombers,
 and star bases.  However, there are people who Ogg people with no kills,
 and people who never take planets simply because it's the only way they
 can see anyone blow up other than themselves.  Terence has advertised
 this sort of behavior as good.  This kind of player is obnoxious because
 it undermine the intire concept of doggfighting (the better player
 survives).

     Ratings Scum: Those who work so hard to improve their own ratings that
 they hurt thier team.

     Planet Scum: A sub-group of Ratings Scum.  Those who waste armies by
 dumping them on planets that can't be defended in order to improve their
 planet ratings.  This can acutally help the team if they have a lot of
 armies or are against a clueless opponent.  Often, however, it hurts the
 team because the planets are quickly recaptured and the armies are lost
 for good.

     Ratio Scum: Another sub-group of Ratings Scum.  Those who are so
 cautious about dogfighting that they rarely get a chance to do it, but
 prefer to pick up injured ships.  These hurt a team by stealing kills
 from those who would use them (to take planets) and by filling up a team
 slot with a more-or-less useless player.  Frequenly, star bases are
 Ratio Scum.

     Ensign Clueless: A special term to denote those players who don't
 really know how to play very well, but help their teams greatly by being
 at the right place at the right time.  These guys can really help Oggers
 and planet taker by distracting opponents and often serve to scare off
 runner scum who would be taking planets.

     Scarecrow: A player who stays in a dangerous situation even though he
 is out of fuel or badly damaged in the hopes of tricking an opponent
 into wasting time or even running.

     I should point out that at times, calling someone a <whatever> scum is
 a compliment.  Particularly, Planet Scum and Ogger Scum can often help
 their teams, and are cheered by thier fellows.

 I've heard usage of many different kinds of "scum" players on this
 group, and, in order to get the different kinds of terminology clear,
 I figured I'd make up a list of all the kinds of scum I can think up.
 I'm sure a bunch of you can make some corrections and additions to the
 26 types of scumming I've listed below, and feel free to do so. :)

 ...

 Planet scum: People who take planets whenever they can, and as often
 as they can, not worrying about how well defended the planet is, and
 of course they tend to only leave one army on it.

 Runner scum: Players who refuse to dogfight even when the fight would
 be a fair one. Applies especially to planet takers and scout bombers.

 Ogger scum: These are people who ogg everyone in sight, even people
 who don't have kills, just to annoy the other team.

 Ratings scum: General scummy players who only play to make the next
 rank and don't bother helping their team any. Rampant on foghorn.

 DI scum: Similar to ratings scum, these people either only play during
 the initial bombing runs, or else quit out near the end of the game
 when there are no more chances for lots of bombing and planet taking.

 Resurrection scum: People who kill you right when you enter the game.
 The worst scum of this type can kill you in this manner several times
 (especially in a borg on needmore) each time you get pissed off and
 come in to kill the person only to be smashed by a plasma and 8 torps
 before you can move or fire anywhere.

 Type II Resurrection scum: Basically the opposite of the above. These
 people use a shiny new ship or two to take out most anyone near their
 home planet, i.e. you are beautifully dogfighting, and manage to take
 out that BB in your DD. Unfortunately you are now going warp 2 and he
 comes right back in and flies at you in a new CA at warp 9 and your
 kill quickly becomes his kill.

 T-mode scum: The worst slime in the galaxy. These are the people who
 at 3am log in 4 times on each side as guest, and then come in as their
 main character and bomb everything and take over the galaxy a few
 times while they are the only one playing = lots of DI.

 Borg scum: People who play borgs during non-borg hours or on non-borg
 servers. Occasionally found on foghorn and elsewhere.

 Hitlers: Scum who log in specifically to hurt a team, and so help the
 opposing side. This can involve giving away kills, going in as their
 SB and letting the enemy kill it (along with 25 armies), telling the
 other side who's carrying, along with other nasty things.

 Starbase scum: People who play a SB and try to individually waste
 anyone that comes near. This involves cloaking and when an enemy comes
 within range, quickly uncloaking and tractoring it in to its death.
 Common tactic found most anywhere. I do it all the time. :)

 Kill scum: People who only play to rack up kills and don't do anything
 with them to help their team. They are often found hanging around the
 SB or around a last planet where they can easily rack up kills.

 Stealer scum: Very annoying teammates who steal your kills or planets,
 e.g. you skillfully wound Flt. Capt. Dodgeswell after a hard dogfight
 and are about to take him out when some Lieutenant flies in and takes
 the kill with one phaser, or you use 4 of your armies to neutralize a
 planet, only to have someone else take it when you are away getting
 more armies. Generally doesn't apply if they take kills from the SB or
 take heavily contested planets.

 Peace scum: Players who declare peace against the opposing team so
 they can get confuse some of the enemy to waste fuel, and can fuel off
 of the enemy planets as well. Generally not applied to scouts mapping
 the galaxy at the beginning of a game if they declare peace.

 Switcher scum: People who switch sides in the middle of a game, often
 to the more clueful team so they can benefit by a quick genocide.
 Especially scummy is to log in on one side, and bomb the enemy flat,
 then quickly switch and bomb the first team flat, to rack up DI.

 Bomber scum: Clueless teammates who during your last planet stand bomb
 the nearest planet that has 5 armies in something other than an AS, or
 bomb in an AS when the planet has 6..8 armies, resulting in an enemy
 planet with 4 armies that you have no hope of ever taking.

 Wall scum: Generally only found on needmore where you can go through
 the walls but yet torps and plasmas det on them. These are people who
 hang around near the wall, fly through it for a few seconds in order
 to let off a plasma and a torp stream, and then go back through the
 wall just before the enemy torps reach them. This is especially fun in
 a SB where your tracking torps can reach the enemy home planet from
 the wall. This can also apply to killing teammates against the wall to
 get kills, or players who plasma themselves to death against the wall
 just when you are about to kill them.

 3rd space scum: People who bomb or take planets in 3rd space to give
 them a planet advantage.

 Robot scum: Players who bring in a 3rd space robot to give them an
 initial advantage if they get genocided, or else attract the
 Terminators or Hunterkillers over into enemy space to wreak havoc.

 Message scum: People who send nasty or insulting messages to
 individuals or teams to intimidate or scroll their screen so they
 can't read useful stuff. Especially applies to those robots.

 Faker scum: People who do things like fly their SB at warp 1 when it's
 not damaged, or pretend to be damaged so you'll chase them and they
 can waste you.

 Newbie scum: Merciless players who target Ensigns and other newbies
 and waste them several times to rack up kills so they can do whatever.

 Ensign scum: Good players who log in as guest or a new Ensign
 character so people will think they are clueless, until they promptly
 get wasted. Especially fun to do against the Newbie scum above.

 Name scum: Similar to Ensign scum, people who play under a different
 name then they are accustomed to. Often involves switching terminals
 with a teammate to confuse the enemy or give an advantage. E.g. a good
 dogfighter gets a kill and switches terminals with the team planet
 taker.

 Clueless scum: People on your own team who do stupid things that don't
 help it any, including but not limited to: giving the enemy kills,
 picking up your only armies and then promptly dying, not listening to
 messages, etc.

 Terminal scum: People who kick you off that nice color xterm because
 you're playing games and they want to use it to get some work done.

 ...

 Of course I like that one definition I read on this group a while
 back, that a ___ scum is someone who does ___ more than I do. :)

 Hi all,
    Ok, you want the origin of "Ogg", I'll give it to you.  This
 is THE official, 100% proof, everyone-else-is-full-of-it story.

     Back in, I believe, November/December of last year I use to
 play netrek much more than now.  At the time, I was probably only
 Flt Captain Sun Tzu, maybe even just a Captain.  A group of us,
 which included Jay Hui (TheSlug), Byron Sinor (Krang), and Steve
 Russel (Khelik) were playing netrek with Terence.  The three of us
 were Feds, Terence was Orion.  It was a full game, and Terence had
 come in as Og <== (beginning to get how it happened :> ).  At this
 time, suiciding people with kills *NEVER* happened.  Dogfighting
 rained supreme, and cloaking was used only for planet taking, that
 is until Terence decided to teach us CMU boys a'lesson.  Steve had
 accumulated a 3, 4 kill ship and had taken Spica (or El Nath, I
 don't remember) and Terence chased him and tried to mutual with him.
 Steve killed him, but was left at ~90% internal.  As he wiggled towards
 Fed. space he watched the galactic map as Og reappeared and began
 to move rapidly in his direction.  I will never forget how his voice
 shattered the calm of the cluster with yells of "It's OGGGGGGGG. HELP!
 HELP!!!!!!!!!.  It's OOOOOOGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!".  His final words were
 something to the effect of "AAAAAAAAAArrrrrrrgggggghhhhhh, I've been
 Ogged!!".  Jay and I immediately picked up on the effectiveness of
 suiciding people, and had Terence show us how to do it better.   That
 is how Ogging started getting popular, and how the name spread
 through Netrek History.

     The :-* is reserved for hitting a carrier with plasma.  One uses one *
 for every army.

 Note of style:
     One is not allowed to post SMACK!, DOOSH! etc for a carrier who has
 succeeded in thier mission even parlially (dropped 2 armies on a
 non-agri, etc.).
     If you have been gloating and a carrier DOES manage to take a planet
 under you, he is allowed to post a DOOSH! message or :-* face after the
 planet's name (Romulus :-***).
     If you are killed by a player phasering your own plasma in your face
 she may post !KCAMS.
     It is in poor taste for a base to post a SMACK! message for a cloaker,
 although for non-cloakers, it's OK.
     DOOSH! messages for less than 3 armies are pathetic.  For three or
 four, they still show insecurity.
     One should only post army motel messages for players who you fear will
 really take you planets.  Posting a message about an actual army hotel is
 kicking someone when they'e down.  A true army hotel will pick up and
 run around for a long time, hopefully calling for escort, being too
 afraid to drop.  A true army hotel is someone who you would prefer if
 they pick up than if they left the armies scattered on random planets.

 Last Planet Stand. If the enemy is down to a few planets, it's useful
 to try to get the hardest ones first (like the home planet) while they
 are still uncertain which planet you're planning to take: i.e. you
 can fake an attack on a different planet in hopes of drawing away
 some defenders. If it gets down to an LPS on the hardest planet, it's
 much harder to take since the enemy knows exactly where you're going.

 If you set your galactic map to show armies ('B') then when you see
 a ship with kills headed to a planet with armies, it's a good bet
 they're picking up...you can get info on the planet before and
 after, count up the difference, and that's how many they carry.

 > I'm not sure where DOOSH came from.

 As far as I know, it came from guys (Ginger, Freeman, Duck?) playing
 netrek from e260 here at Berkeley.  Duck used to make phaser sound-effects
 when he would decloak and fire while ogging.  Freeman (I think) would
 make a quiet "doosh" sound when he successfully ogged someone ('doosh'
 is an onomatopoetic sound representing the explosion.)  But Freeman got
 kind of loud at times, and he (and others, because it was fun) started
 yelling "doosh!" after particularly difficult or important oggs.

 > It means to kill another player who is carrying armies.

 Actually, this is sort of oversimplified.  It means to kill an important
 carrier who is carrying a reasonable number of armies.  Any kill of a
 base that has been effective in gameplay is a doosh, whether the base
 was carrying armies or not.  

 There are some other odd spots where "doosh" applies.  Any particularly
 large display of carnage (such as two fleets meeting at a planet and going
 up in an 8-ship chain explosion) certainly qualify.  Also, even if a
 starbase were very weak and innefective, any base ogg where 6-7 ships
 uncloaked simultaneously from well-spread angles such that it is very
 clear that the base hasn't got a snowball's chance in hell, is quite
 clearly a "Doosh!"


 I sort of find the servers with "in-server autodoosh" annoying.  If someone
 is on the front line and picks up two armies to keep them from getting
 bombed and expects to die anyway, and someone comes up and kills him,
 that is by no means a doosh, but the server will announce "doosh" anyway,
 which is silly.

 Of course, the word has evolved even more.  "Doosh doosh!" is often used
 verbally as an interjection celebrating success.  Also, the gerund
 "dooshing" is often synonymous with "playing netrek" (along the same lines
 as "trekking", but with more violent connotations.)

 Hmm. I have to admit I've helped cause the problem somewhat.  My
 standard playing tactic (now...) goes something like this.
 1) Look at the players on the other team, anyone who has kills dies.
 2) When all the players having more than 2 kills and all 1 kill assaults
 are dead then hop in a scout/destroyer and go deep bombing until they
 have no armies
 3) goto 1
 Subject to the following "interrupts"
 0) At any point in the above if we happen to find myself with >1 kill
 grab some armies and take a planet until we get ogged to death.
 1) Stop and defend some newly taken planet since it may only have 1 army
 on it and is too easily taken (by the way this is a great opportunity
 for ogging the guy who is coming in to take the planet back.....)
 2) Ogg the enemy SB if he's hurt/too deep in my territory
 3) At a random point in time when the enemy team is on a low ebb, play
 conservative to gain 2 kills then play the old Quar technique (be a
 general planet-taking/runner scum.... :-) )

 As it happens I'm not too concerned about who I'm ogging in step #1 so
 anybody with kills becomes a target.  Though as time progresses I stop
 ogging people when they show a lack of interest in taking planets.  Why
 ogg the dogfighters?  But it usually takes 30 minutes before I sort out
 who's who....

 P.S.  We could always take planets, but now I ogg respectively, though I
 still can't dogfight worth shit against the "good" players.  But I'm
 still learning..... QUAR WITH THE 1.0 OFFENSE!!  (:-))

 I find the best way to defeat the oggers is to run at max warp anywhere
 from head on to right angles to the ogger this causes him to fly by and
 it is easy to pour torps into him and a phaser burst or two to finish
 him off.  This takes timing though for starting to early you get at to
 far a range and the kill probability is to low and starting too late the
 ogger's chance to kill you, especially in a BB with those #@(%!*%
 Phasers, dramatically increases.  Leaving the planet at anything greater
 than 90 degrees is usually fatal, because of the ogger's explosion.

 with all due respect, the easiest way to escape any ogger is to do two

 2)  Max warp out of there in any direction.

 It's that's simple.

 Subject: Help File 12 - Ogging

 Greetings all,
   Here's the Help-File on Ogging and How to Avoid being Ogged.  Since
 everyone's been wondering I decided to post it, as well as send it to
 the people who asked me.  (Note:  This is a long post).

 Chapter 12:  Ogging and How to Avoid Being Ogged.

   The act of ogging is the suiciding of your ship with the sole intent of
 killing a specific enemy ship (hereby refered to as the target).  An
 ogger does not care if he lives or dies and often tries to utilize his
 explosion as a form of attack on the target.  An ogger only cares if his
 target dies.

 NON-SB  TARGETS

 Choosing Your Ship:
   You can ogg in any ship (except SB's), with BB's and CA's being optimal
 due to their excellent phasers and tractors.  BB's and CA's are also the
 best ogging ships because of their fuel supply and their ability to take
 more damage than other, smaller ships (this extra damage often allows
 you to get one more phaser off, or allows you to close to where your
 explosion will also kill your target.)  AS an ogger, you want to use
 your ship's explosion as a weapon.  You want to keep tractoring your
 target so that he cannot escape the additional 100 points of damage you
 will cause him (70 if you are in a scout).  If your target is flying a
 fast ship, you probably do not want to fly a BB.  If your target is a
 scout, you don't want a CA either.  (The only exception to this is an
 inexperienced target who will not run-away from a cloaker/ogger.  In
 this case, the BB/CA's phasers will destroy the smaller ship of the
 target).  If the target is a DD or SC, I would suggest trying a DD 
 (using a SC if you are adept at them).  If you choose one of these
 smaller ships, you must make sure you are as close as possible before
 attacking, since it is doubtful you will get a second shot off.  The
 only other time you chose a fast ogging ship is if you have just failed
 an ogg, and left the target at warp 3 or less.  In this case, you want a
 scout inorder to minimize the amount of repair and running that the
 target can do.  

 Knowing When to Ogg:
   The best time to ogg is while the target is engaged in a dogfight or
 has other opponents on his tactical screen.  An inexperienced target
 will almost never be watching his galactic at times such as these (Note:
  good players ALWAYS watch the galactic, even while dogfighting...but
 this is the time when they are most susceptible to being ogged).  Try to
 conserve fuel on the approach, avoiding enemy ships who wish to
 dogfight.  Remember that your sole task in the world is to kill the
 target...not some joe-schmoo who happens to get in your way.  There are
 two approaches to ogging:       
   1) You fly max warp as soon as you appear, and refuel before the ogg if
 necessary.  Often you do not even refuel, but simply fly max warp right
 at the target.  
   2)  Conserve fuel by flying at your ships cruise speed.  Wait for your
 target to pick his planet that he wants and intercept him.  A variation
 of this theme is to wait until your target is "dogfighting" someone (see
 above) and then begin your ogg wave.

 The Ogg:
   Once you choose to begin your ogg wave (which is as soon as you come
 out in case 1 above..), you should do the following.  First, don't lock
 onto the target, you will slow down at an inopportune time if you do. 
 Wait until the last possible moment before you cloak.  This will become
 clear with time, but you obviously don't want to cloak while they are on
 the screen.  Good players will recognize an ogg if you cloak while off
 the screen.  In this case, you should cloak even farther back.  Again,
 you will have to get the feel of when to cloak depending on who the
 target is.  While cloaked, fly max warp towards target.  Do not fly
 straight at target, or straight behind if you can avoid it.  If the
 target turns and begins to run, uncloak ASAP.  If you do not uncloak and
 hose him immediately, he will simply make you run out of fuel.  Try to
 uncloak as close to the target as possible.  The closer you are, the
 more damage your phasers will do, the less likely he will dodge your
 torps, and the greater the chance that you will be able to blow up on
 him.  When you uncloak, immediately do ALL the following (yep, ogging is
 not easy....)
         1) tractor the enemy
         2) phaser the enemy
         3) fire torps at the enemy
         4) det the enemies torps if they are going to hit (you often det
         anyways since you should be almost right on top of them and     
         you will assume that his torps will hit...)
         5) get your ship as close to his as possible (which may require
         turning, slowing down/speeding up, or both...)
 Once you are able to master this, you should be able to begin ogging
 effectively.  The most important thing is to know when to ogg.

 ABORTED OGGS
   Sometimes you will simply not be able to reach your target.  Either he
 will run too quickly, you'll be too damaged, or you will have run out of
 fuel.  In cases such as these it is important to give your kill to
 someone who can not use it.  Use the following chart while deciding who
 you will let kill you.  (NOTE:   You want them to kill you since that
 way you can grab another ship and ogg the target agian.  Good oggers
 never give up, though you may have to change targets). 
         1)  The enemy SB.  (SB's can't do anything with thier kills except
         look at them...)
         2)  HunterKiller (it doesn't matter if the robot gets kills).
         3)  Let the target have your kill (he already has kills, so one more
         won't help him any....)
         4)  A clueless Ensign on the other team.  (he'll probably die before
he
         ever uses your kill....)
         5)  Enemy Planet (This will work on if you are badly damaged).
         6)  Any person on the other team with 2 or more kills (They can
         already carry enough armies to take a planet so one more kill   
         won't give them any advantage).
         7)  Someone who is very hurt (you might be able to kill them with
         your explosion).

 SB OGGS

   Ogging a SB is much different than ogging a normal player.  A SB is not
 going to run away from you (at least not at a speed you need to worry
 about.....).  SB's will also be concentrating on cloakers, since that is
 their main threat.  In order to do an effective SB ogg, you should
 never** lock onto the SB since you will slow down to warp 2 unless you
 continue to hit a higher warp key.  The approach is the most important
 part of the SB ogg.  There are three possible ways to approach the SB. 
 (NOTE: You are cloaked in the first two approaches, uncloaked in the
 third.)
   1)  Fly at max warp, but NOT DIRECTLY AT HIM.  If you fly directly at
 him, you will almost certainly die, either by plasma or a stream of
 torps aimed at your ?? marks.  If you approach this way, aim at a point
 1-2 inches to the side of the base.  Uncloak BEFORE you are along side
 him, and tractor him into you.  This makes you a harder target to hit,
 but you will probably not blow up on him.  
   2)  The other approach is to lower your speed to approx. warp 4 (to
 dodge plasmas and torps).  Choosing your time to uncloak is the tricky
 part.  The best time to uncloak is immediately after the SB has fired a
 stream of torps that will miss you.  By doing this, the only weapon he
 can use is his phaser, unless he det's his own torps.  This might allow
 you to get off two phasers and two torp streams, though it is still
 unlikely.  Once you uncloak, you should immediately tractor, phaser and
 torp.  You probably do NOT want to det his torps, since the only chance
 you have of living long enough for another phaser is if he misses with
 his torps.
   3)  This approach works best against inexperienced or hurt bases. 
 Simply grab a BB (CA's might work as well....), and fly max warp
 straight at the base.  As soon as the base is on your screen begin to
 tractor, phaser and shoot torps.  If you KNOW you are not going to be
 able to dodge his torps, det them.  Otherwise, try to get as close as
 possible before exploding.  

   Do not expect to kill the SB with one ogg, you must be willing to
 simply put as much dmg as possible into him with your ship, and hope
 that everyone else can finish him off.  Remember that you can also grab
 another ship and attack him again before he can move very far (though SB
 repair rates are higher than normal ships....).  

 EFFECTIVE SB OGGS (ie, COORDINATION)
   Against an experienced SB, one person ogging will never kill him.  If
 you wish to cause any sort of damage to him, you must be able to
 organize your team for a multi-person ogg.  In this case, you want to
 attack from as many sides as possible. 

 ***NOTE:   Never fly on top of, or directly behind another ogger.  This
 will allow the SB to fire at two guys at once, often killing the second
 with the explosion of  the first.  YOU MUST SEPERATE!  Having more than
 one ogger blow up with one torp spray is the reason why many SB's have
 lived.  It CAN make that much of a difference.  Since you know this, it
 is up to you to move your ship so that you are not in the same line of
 attack as another teammate.  Remember...seperate, and kill.   **

   It will often require more than one ogg wave to kill a good SB.  In
 this case, you must be willing to sacrifce a planet or two if you know
 the enemy SB if almost dead.  (A good indication is if he is at warp 1
 ,which indicates that he has 300+ internal).  In coordinating SB oggs,
 it is often effective to combine a type 1,2 ogg with a type 3 ogg.  This
 will make his escorts shoot at the uncloaked person, increasing the
 chance that the cloaked oggers will get in.  

 AVOIDING OGGS
   There are many ways to avoid being ogged.  I will simply list them
 since they should be self explanitory.

         1) cloak and run at a 90 degree angle to the incoming ogg
         2) simply run at a 90 degree angle to the incoming ogg
         3) run directly away from the ogger
         4) cloak and fake a run, but then fly directly by the ogger
         5) slow down until you think he's just about to uncloak (don't let
         him get too close, though....) and then accelerate.  Fire torps
         and phasers as soon as he uncloaks....
         6) run to your SB and let him kill the ogger
         7) run straight at him (though this is very dangerous against good
         oggers....)
         8)  cloak and run striaght at him (still dangerous, but less so....)
         9)  fly to a pack of friends and let them get the free kill.....

   The best defense against an ogg, is either #1 or #2.  In either of
 these cases, always fire torps behind you in the hopes of pinpointing
 the oggers location.  Once you know roughly where he is, try to phaser
 him inorder to attract the attention of your teammates.  NOTE:  Do not
 do this if you are low on fuel.  It is more important for you to avoid
 the ogg, than to kill the ogger.  
         
 Note 2:  If you should ever find yourself unable to avoid the ogg
 completely, remember to pressor the ogger ASAP!  You should also try to
 just cripple him, since you will then have some time to take a planet,
 repair, or refuel before he is either killed, or repairs sufficiently. 
 If necessary det his torps, since he will generally have less fuel than
 you.  Remember....always watch your galactic map!

 Subject: Duck's Secret to Reaming a Base
 Date: 28 Oct 91 01:00:41 GMT
 Sender: usenet@agate.berkeley.edu (USENET Administrator)

 Since I hate starbases I am divulging one my best starbase ogging 
 secrets. All it takes is a good partner to really hurt the base on your 
 first run and then the second run usually finishes him off, but by then
 the whole team know the base is in trouble so it is usually a goner.

 Basically, the whole key to a joint ogg is timing, you want the first ship
 to be appear next to the base just a split second before the next ship appears

 which adds the most fright to a base pilot. This is rather difficult to 
 achieve since one must tell the other when he goes in for the ogg and
 how fast he is going. Thus lost time in typing, a couple of valuable 
 seconds that can make the difference. 

 Solution:
         Use your galactic map! A signal given by the designated leader is
 the best bet to go in once you see it. Cloaking is the signal that I use
 since you can see a cloaker on the galactice map. Why use the galactic map?
 Cuz you want your partner to ogg from the opposit direction, not on your
 local map, to have the starbase's torps more spread out. Usually, one ship
 from the left and one from the right. But in order ot be effective both
 ships must be close to equidistant from the base when the leader cloaks.
 And both must max warp at it and the closer you get to the base the more of
 your personal skill you use to get as close to the base as possible. As you
 can see however both ships will arrive at the base at pretty much the same
 time and you allow one ship to uncloak first which will send most of the
 bases's torps at him while the next uncloaks pretty much on top giving it
 all she has. Freeman and I (Koh) on CMU ogged Tufu behind Rom using this
 tactic even with all that delay. I ask Gundam to experiment with me on
 bezier on some pretty good base, it only took us 2 runs togehter to get it.
 And we did it 3 times that game. So far on average a successful ogg like
 that put about 600 damage since usually 260 comes from 2 battleship
 explosions and the rest phaser fire major torps. As for the personal touch
 of getting in close to a base alone, Ronnie Lott will not give away that
 secret. Heheheh.

 Subject: Re: Locking & Clockers
 Date: Tue, 07 Apr 92 06:23:13 GMT

 I use this feature VERY often - when ogging & for planet defense.
 Hate to give away something that can be used against me, but here goes
 ....

 When ogging a person who cloaks a lot: Just before you cloak, lock on
 to him.  As you approach and he cloaks, immediately uncloak to save
 fuel.  Watch the galactic map.  If it appears he is changing
 directions, slow to warp 1 or 2 ASAP and you will track him.  When it
 looks as if he finished his manuver, max warp - thats what he'll
 probably do.  Speed control via careful watching of the galactic map
 is critical in order to track him but not lose him.  Throw out one or
 two phasers directly in front of you to try for phaser lock.  If you
 get it, phaser mercilessly and rely on the phaser lock.  More often
 than not, you'll get him.  You can do the slow-auto-turn manuver while
 cloaked if he has defenders, uncloaking as soon as you've got a true
 bearing, but don't spend too much time cloaked - watch your fuel.  If
 you have to dodge torps, do it - and you're no worse off than not
 getting the lock.  You win if you don't have to doge.

 When ogging a person who doesn't usually cloak:  Forget the lock -
 going straight at him usually means a torp stream in the face.   But
 you won't need it since he's not cloaked.  For someone who fires a
 stream first and then cloaks, wait for him to fire and then establish
 the lock.  He's toast (hopefully) if he cloaks.  Know you're enemy's
 tactics.

 Planet defense: You know who the army carriers are - there should be
 very few of them.  Stay at a planet warp 0, establish lock on the most
 threatening person.  Just sit there until he is about to orbit, then
 fire like crazy directly in front of you.  Most effective against
 pesky scouts who usually zoom in without escorts.  They can be in and
 out before you can hunt him in the normal method.

 Some other food for thought:
         When ogging and the carrier has escorts that you have
 difficulty penetrating - forget the carrier and ogg one of the
 escorts.  You want to get rid of as many escorts as possible before
 the group gets to one of your planets.  You are relying on the rest of
 your team to take out what's left.  Often, you can get two or three
 attempts at your primary target before he reaches the planet he is
 going after.
         When ogging, you WANT to die.  First, you are counting on your
 explosion to cause additional damage.  Second, you don't want to waste
 time repairing/refueling - you want to come back immediately and
 resume the pressure.  HOWEVER, you MUST take out your target, and get
 killed by ONLY him - don't leave a kill behind.  If you do, you have
 another target to add to your list.  A very effective tactic I
 recently picked up from MUCUS PIG is to intentionally drop your
 shields when you KNOW you will kill him.  Ogging is used for kill
 management - you defeat your purpose if you give away kills.
         When ogging and your target runs deep into his own space and
 you are doubtful that you can get him, ogg someone else.  You've
 accomplished your mission - prevent him from taking a planet/dropping
 armies.  Don't let someone else get an easy kill while you
 single-mindedly go after your primary target.  Once he comes forward
 again, go after him again.  You gain precious time for your own
 planets to pop in LPS situations, and the rest of the time you are
 effectively slowing the enemy's expansion.  Runner scums are the least
 threat to your team - they can't take planets if they are always
 running.
         Watch what Val (can't spell his full name), ensign, MUCUS PIG
 and other good oggers do when they ogg you, and learn from them.

 Just some ramblings that I hope will be usefull.......

 Subject: Re: Strategy---how do you know??

 Some notes from Quar:
   If I'm ogging ensign clueless (hope no-one is using that name...) I can
 usually live and have a little fuel left.  The trick is if I can die and
 get back to the front line faster than I can by going to a fuel planet
 and refueling then I want to die.  If you decide the game needs a
 dedicated ogger (my favorite!) then consider declaring peace with your
 enemy if the game is fairly even or your loosing.  If you miss in an ogg
 or have to chase someone too far you can always refuel at their planets
 then.....  Unfortunately you can't bomb so you give up that option, but
 one can't have everything.
   I'm not positive but I think I invented the shield drop ogg as well as
 the det once past just incase the guy missed you!!!  The det also has
 the added benefit of injurying someone who is real close to your
 intended target plus if anyone else fired at you your det will injury
 the target.
   The greatest and most careful oggs are those I achieve under the nose
 of a SB.  There is nothing like ogging someone next to a base (this is
 where I usually kill the guy with a DET and "phasor of death" since I
 may not even fully decloak before I'm pulverised.  - you can det while
 cloaked so det those SB torps on your victim and use your explosion to
 finish him off).  Note: ogging someone next to a really cluefull SB
 (i.e. Balton/Kevin) is really hard and I suggest waiting for the guy to
 leave before ogging him, but if he's only ferrying to the SB then "go
 for it".
   The art: to die right on top of your target.

 >or a starbase)? Lock on target flying at max warp doesn't work.

         Maxwarp is mostly useful for getting generally near the target befor
 she wanders off.  Once you are actually in shooting range, you will
 probably want to be going slower.  Watch your fuel.  While a kill can be
 made with just over 1000 fuel + your own explosion, most succesful Oggs
 require ~3000 fuel after coming out of cloak.
         Know when to uncloak.  Know what to do when you do.  There is a good
 deal of just pure practice involved, but here are some rules of thumb:

 1) Uncloak where they don't expecet you.  If you've come in from the
 back, try to slide past to the side.  This makes it harder to hit you
 with a planned stream of torps.

 2) Try to find your target unready.  If she's fighting, running from
 someone else, or going to orbit, she's probably not ready to be Ogged.

 3) Det.  You should assume that your target expects you, and will fire. 
 You will take some damage.  Minimise it.

 4) If they know exactly where you are, you might as well uncloak.  You
 will probably wipe out, but at least you can do some damage.

 5) Tractor works befor your other weapons do.

 6) If she runs straight away at maxwarp, she'll probably get away. 
 Chase her off, and the retreat or die and be ready to try again.

 7) If you have to die (and sometimes you do), give the kill to a player
 who can't use it.  Normally, whoever you're ogging is the best choice,
 but most SBs are more than willing to kill you.

 8) If your target runs deep into third planet space, uncloak and Shark
 Ogg her.  Don't get too close (practice again).  Cut her off whenever
 she tries to go home, and dodge her torps, but you don't need to attack
 until the time is perfect.  Try to get her to a wall, or better, a
 corner.  When she tries to turn arround, use the heavy end of the hammer.

 9) Make sure you die.  Turn your sheilds off, and get right on top of her.

 Subject: Re: SB stuff

     First of all, 90% of SB Oggs are pointless and should not be attempted.
 Don't call for the Ogg unless you are a) Sure to do it in one wave b)
 certain that the SB is of critical immediate importance (ie. LPS) or c)
 certain that your team won't do anything useful until it's gotten base
 Ogging out of it's system.
     Having determined that Ogging *is* worth it, you must then determine
 what you have to Ogg with and against.  I will assume that it is not a
 clued SB with a clued defense at it's home planet, because this would be
 impossible to Ogg, and therefore not worth the effort.  Find out who all
 is reading your message bboard.  If you have a fair number who answer
 messages quickly, you have a fighting chance at an Ogg.  
     What to write:  Let your team know that you are in for the Ogg.  Try to
 pick a time when they are not carrying armies.  Give them a good
 estimate of when the Ogg will hit the SB.  60 seconds is a good amount
 of time.  It is also good to post a few times after that so that people
 know about how long it's been since the first post.  60, 40, 20, 10, is
 probably good.  If you get sidetracked on the way in, hope that the team
 goes in anyway.
     Always assume that your team will take a no-optimal line in.  This
 means that you will lose a lot of teammates.  YOU should try to be
 behind the SB on the assumption that your teammates won't be.  Hit the
 base a moment before or a moment after the rest of the team does.  This
 forces the base to either presser toward your teammates or toward you,
 in either case, it takes extra damage.  Only cloak to avoid escorts. 
 The base has only one presser beam, and she's going to use it on
 someone. Save your fuel for doing damage.  Try to blow up on the base,
 but not until you've hit it a bunch at range.  Your explosion is only
 worth 3 torps.

 What I want to see is:

 F0->FED  base og soon?
 F4->FED  i'll og base with my next ship
 F6->FED  me too
 F7->FED  ogging, synching with F4

 so far without anybody firing a shot or even looking threatening so as
 to scare the base; you don't want it to retreat, and you especially don't
 want it to get escort.  The feds that are ogging should watch each other
 on the galactic map, especially watching F4, so they all arrive simultaneously
 from different angles, and uncloak together.  As the synch man, F4 should
 ideally be starting from far away and moving steadily towards the target.
 to make it easy for people to tell how long they have to get there.  If
 F4 gets held up or killed, you can still synch with his ghost, i.e. pretend
 he was able to continue.  For the next wave, use a scout if you need to
 catch up to F4, and if you have extra time, go around to attack the base
 from behind.  After two waves, the og may be detrimental, in which case
 you need some leadership to say:

 F4->FED  last wave
 ...
 F4->FED  CEASE OG
 F4->FED  3++ 8++ 

 The team is never going to completely agree on when to og, and when to
 stop, so you've got to somehow have a leader that people heed.

 Another tough question is whether to scum planets while your team
 is ogging the base, or to help with the og instead.  In most cases I'd
 say keep on scumming, but it's a touchy point.  Against an LPS where
 the defenders have a base, always go for the planet if you can; the
 base og is most valuable as a distraction to help you take the planet.
 In an even game, you should perhaps help with the base og instead,
 if only to show team spirit.

 No, I don't think it's reasonable to expect to be able to instruct
 newbies on this or any other difficult aspect of the game over the
 message board during a game.  But once you have the good players
 coordinated, maybe they'll figure out how to join up with the attack wave.
 It probably won't really matter; it's the first wave which does
 the most damage, and only clue and timely message-reading is going
 to give you a good synchronized first wave.

      You've got a bad attitude, son.  _Any_ base can be squashed.

      You're too far out, if you're going warp 7.  Tighter spirals are
 necessary to actually get to the base.  A good baser will peg you with
 phasers if you spend too much time flying on the periphery.

      And ah... I see why people criticized you.  I _never_ lock on to bases
 _this_ far out.  I'll finish with your list, then say where I'd do it
 differently.

      You're getting way too specific here.  It's impossible to judge what
 will happen at this point.  You just have to react.  That's why warp 5 is
 also too fast.  Try warp 4 when you're "fairly close"  A psychic CA can

      Okay... it seems Roger has the right idea, for the wrong reasons.
 Let's go visit FillInTheBaseOgg and see what he thinks about this (not that
 any of you give a flying Philadelphia, but it's my post, so there..)

      The locking function is very useful..  when you're practically on top
 of the base.  After you've weaved your way through the torps at warp 3-4,
 follow this procedure (modifying as necessary).

      1) Aim past him to the side, and increase to warp 5-6.
      2) Raise shields if they're not already up (they should be up:).
      3) Wait until you're just about next to him, then...
           LockonUncloakTractorPhaserTorpTorpTorpTorpTorpTorpTorpTorpPhaser
         If he had people on or near him, insert liberal detting in with
         the weapons firing, in the hopes of taking someone with you.

      The reason for the lock on and tractor, is that at warp 3-4 you can
 pull a tight circle on top of him, and since you're not really allowed to
 dock, you'll just drop to warp 2 and flit back and forth across his
 surface.  Even against the best bases this can cause a few of their weapons
 to miss.  You don't have to change your aim, of course..  Just keep the
 mouse on his center and slam those weapons.

      Some quick hints :

           Against the better bases, drop your shields on top of them.  Die
      before they get the opportunity to pressor you away.

           If there are people on top of him, treat it just like you're
      ogging them.  If they try to get away, tractor/pressor them right back
      onto the base, while you're firing all your weapons.  Explosions are
      pretty..

           Don't worry about losing fuel..  You won't be needing more than
      5000 when you hit the base.  So you'll spend about 2000 crusing to
      the base at maxwarp, shields down, then another 3000 getting in close,
      cloaked.  With 5000 left, you'll have enough for a full round of 
      weapons, tractors, and a det.

           The Tractor, inserted between the Uncloak and Phaser in the
      sequence I presented earlier, is a necessity, and has no penalty
      associated with it.  There's the delay between uncloaking and firing
      that you can't avoid anyway, so make use of it by tractoring and
      even dodging a little.

           Don't clump your torps if you're firing from a distance.  Use a
      nice spread, so he can't get them with one det.

           Phasers are _nasty_ at close range.  If you get on top of the
      base fully uncloaked, you should do a _minimum_ of 200 damage between
      your phasers and explosion.  If he's a pressor base, make sure you
      drop your shields in the hopes of exploding before you get too far
      away.

           When you're coming en masse, always have one person uncloak a
      little earlier.  Make sure he is your best dogfighter, with the
      ability to phaser plasmas and dodge torps.  Have him uncloak at
      about maximum phaser range for him, and then try to proceed toward
      the base at warp 4, detting and phasering.  Torping is optional.  It
      can be used by the base to blow up your teammates, but if they're on
      top of him like that, you _want_ them to explode;)


      Ack.. I've gotta run to a meeting.. more later.

     You say that the only time you use a scout is to ogg difficult DD's. 
 Perhaps that's the point that people are trying to illustrate.  Against
 average Joe Schmo's the DD is a good ogger, but against good INL calibre
 players (read : difficult DD's and scouts) you need to use a scout
 (which is what 5150 does).  I find it hard to believe that against a
 *harder* opponent you would use a ship that would be worse at ogging
 (and hense decrease your chance of killing him).  

     My personal preference really depends on the location of the carrier,
 who he is, and what ship type he is in.  All of these play into what
 ship type and what tactic I use (Escort type and number also play into
 what tactic).  

 Enemy                   Me              Me if enemy has good escort
 SC (near front)         SC/DD           SC/DD and a prayer
 SC (backfield)          CA              CA
 DD (front)              SC/DD           SC/DD and a prayer
 DD (back)               DD/CA           CA
 CA (front)              SC/DD/CA        DD/CA
 CA (back)               CA/BB           CA/BB
 BB (front)              CA              CA/BB
 BB (back)               SC/CA/BB        CA/BB
 AS (front)              SC/DD/CA        SC/DD/CA
 AS (back)               CA              CA

     Basically, I prefer ogging in a CA since the combined phaser power and
 maneuverability makes it (IMNSHO) the best ogger.  If you uncloak and
 phaserlock any ship on the first shot you probably have a 80+% chance of
 killing it no matter what escort is around (assuming you are within
 30-40 point phaser range).  Against good planet takers this probably
 drops to around 50% and if you miss your first phaser I'd say it's more
 like 40%/20% for average/good planet takers, respectively.  Everyone is
 going to have their own opinion, so argueing the merits of one over the
 other is not exactly an easy thing to do :).

 Exploding on a base does 100 points of damage(provided you live long
 enough to get RIGHT on top of him, and you aren't in a SC or SB).  Thats
 3 undetted torps worth.  Surely you can do more than that just by
 plinking the base.  I've always thought that explosion damage is a
 rather negligible portion of the damage that is needed to kill the base.
 DD's are useful for base ogging because they have more range capacity
 and manuverablity, not because they have the same explosion damage.  If
 you feel that to be an effective base ogger, you need to blow up on the
 base, then you wouldn't consider many of the games best base oggers to
 be effective.

 Lone oggers can kill bad bases, and can even drive good ones back.

 Plinking can kill bases much easier than oggs can, but plinking is much
 slower.  Often times there is a small window that you need to kill the
 base within (or, say, his escort arrives).  If you miss this window, you
 probably can't kill the base...and this is why base ogging is more
 useful than base plinking.  This is also why base plinking works less in
 very clueful games than in clueless games....because the windows are
 smaller.

 The only real thing I want to add about base oggs is this:  I encourage
 diversity on base oggs.  I love to see an ogg with 1 SC, 2 AS's, 1 CA, 1
 BB, and 1 DD.  An important part of a good base surviving base oggs is
 to estimate damage to kill a cloaker...using different ships makes this
 very difficult.

 I disagree about the det comment.  It WILL decrease damage when done

 So the base doesn't det properly, and doesn't watch the galactic while
 being pelted.

 Depends on how good my team is.  I can move away (with pressor) from 4
 plinkers, and with occasional dets and torp streams keep damage down.
 Meanwhile my team has a 7 on 4 advantage.

 What is the best use of time?  Fuel is free...

 > Against good players, cloaking is just a waste of fuel anyway.
 NO!  It will take a few extra shots to locate you (minor advantage).
 He can't see exactly where everyone is when aiming weapons (moderate
 advantage), and he can't TP you (HUGE advantage).  

 Even if you're plinking, allowing the base the pressor of someone to
 move away is negating a large portion of the advantage you've attained
 by staying at range.

 I've seen large number of potentially crushing ogg waves broken up
 because someone came in uncloaked, and the base pressored them (and
 they kept coming).  Wonderful, now the base is moving away (so you
 burn more fuel/time to catch up to him), it's easier for him to dodge,
 and he's getting closer to his friends.

     Ogging a base is, in essense, petty simple.  Just do 1100 damage,
 and it's gone.  One CA can do this on one tank of gass if everything is
 perfect.

 Probelm:  It's never perfect.  It's never even close.

     Normally, when Ogging the base, 2 or 3 players do the VAST majority
 of the damage.  All of the Other Oggers do a little damage, but more
 importantly they open up the opportunity for those 2 or 3.  When Ogging
 the base, as with any other time, play like a team player.  Sure, if you
 get the chance to unload, you should, but if you can open up the hole
 for a team-mate, do so.  You can help by:

 1)  Ogging an escort (unless you're right at his homeworld).
 2)  Plinking from behind so that he can't retreat.
 3)  Plinking while he's trying to repair between Oggs.
 4)  Running around cloaked to raise his w-temp  (It's very useful to
     get phasered at 20 point range in an AS.)
 5)  Tractoring team-mates off of eachother.  You'd be surprised by how
     many Oggs are ruined because two people are on top of each other.
 6)  Drawing off his escort by taking Cet (agri).
 7)  Bomb or take a planet really near him.

 Subject: Defending planets against bases

 All too often, I see something like this:

 Team A is busily flying around Doing Stuff.  Team B's base moves over to the
 nearest enemy agri with some escorts, and they take the planet with the base
 supporting.

 Team A then goes wild trying to ogg the base, which is already retreating as
 fast as it can.  Naturally, they fail.

 Whenever I see a base heading toward an agri, I start posting "BASE is moving
 to Arc" messages on the team board.  IMnsHO, *THIS* is when the base ogg
 should begin, when it's a bit over halfway between home and the front.  It
 doesn't have to be a full ogg, just 3-4 guys synchronized enough to get in
 past the escort or two and do a few hundred points of damage to the base...
 enough to make it think twice about trying to escort all the way to the
 planet.  One of the escorts probably has a couple of kills, so one of the
 oggers can nail the escort instead.

 It all depends on what else is going on, of course, but I'd like to see a
 bit more "preventative base ogging".

   I'd like to point out to those who are new to SBs that I've found that
 there are three things that massively help in survival.
 1) Team mates who help spotting/killing cloakers.
 2) Clueless opponents.
 3) Heavy use of the pressor beam.

 I had a lot of help from #2 last night and occational very important
 help from #1 (Thanks to Sun Tzu for the drag when I was DEAD).  When the
 going is tough, remember that a starbase moves faster with a
 tractor/pressor beam than at full warp.

 I'd also like to point out that I only got about 50 kills.

 You left out a few things that SBer's should know....
   4) Be patient..   don't tractor in every enemy you see.  Examine the
 situation first... if your not going to be pulled (remember, he'll run
 and drag you at warp 7 towards the home planet...) into trouble, kill
 the guy.  Otherwise just be patient and fire torps (unless he's a fool
 an gets really close.... :-> )
   5) Hope you have someone willing to tow you to safety.  I can't mention
 the number of times I've been over 500 internal, only to survive because
 a teammate (or enemy.... if they fly by, I tractor them but don't kill
 them to let THEM tow me back..) towed me to a repair planet.

   I do have to admit that Hugh played really good last night, though I
 only wish I had had fuel when those two last cloakers came in... I might
 have been able to kill one before he got to yah, Hugh. :-(

   While I'm on the subject of SBing, if a SB needs to be towed.  LET THE
 SB USE THE TRACTOR!!!  You (the ship) just go warp 7, and let the SB
 tractor.  His w temp will NOT overheat, while yours would in a very
 short time.  I try to tell people this and it always comes off in a
 negative conotation (ie, as if I'm angry with them; which, of course,
 I'm not.)   Just me two bits worth..

 Subject: Starbases and Other Trivial Things

 Hi guys!
 I read with keen interest the articles on bases. A key factor is that a
 cooperative team is essential for a base to perform properly. If
 teammates do not help a base when required, the base has no use. This
 includes responding to distress calls, bringing armies to the base (if a
 guy is at rigel and say earth pops a few) etc. That night when I raked
 up the kills my teammates were helping me a lot. It would have been
 impossible for me to handle 3 cloakers for a planet simultaneously. A
 bad experience is when an enemy player is cloaked on you, and a clueless
 guy (or someone in for cheap kills) blows him up on you. This can send
 your damage skyward if you don't have full shields.
 Thanks for listening........
 Adios

 A couple other SB notes:
   If a SB seems to be holding an opponent with the tractor and your in
 the area kill him!  I often hold others (and eat/det their torp spreads)
 in an effort to give players kills - this goes out there to those
 players who just think I'm playing with the guy for fun.  NOTE: if I
 give you a kill DON'T go ogg the next guy on the screen and die - not
 after I just took 100+ damage for you!  If I'm giving people kills then
 its probably the case that I have armies and want you to take a planet,
 or ferry armies to me, etc.....
   Flash your shields if heavily wounded and the SB will try to protect
 you.  NOTE:  if you do this when opponents are on the screen the'll
 probably come after you....
   If the SB is getting ogged (always look at galactic when docked) fly
 away and shoot torps/phasor!  Don't make me pressor you since then I
 can't pressor the ogger.
   If the SB doesn't look like he's fighting but is being attacked HELP
 him!  Its probably the case that his WT is way high and he can't fight!
 Its also the case that your SB is way more important to you team than
 you are since it probably has more armies on it!
   Respond to distress calls that a SB sends out even if it looks like
 he's not hurt.  Often I'm caught in the situation where I'm way forward
 and I have no wingman and there are 3-4 oggers coming in.  This is BAD
 NEWS usually!  OR the distress call was for someone to take a planet the
 SB is near - either way respond...
   If your going to take a planet and the SB is there let him know ahead
 of time.  I'm happy to "orbit" a planet and det torps for you, plus kill
 oggers....

 Howdy,

    A few things I have noticed while SBing recently is the general lack
 of cluelessness when it comes to docking... Because of this, I figured
 now would be a good time to explain a few things about using your local
 friendly Starbase. Although every SB has his own style (vive la

 everyone...
