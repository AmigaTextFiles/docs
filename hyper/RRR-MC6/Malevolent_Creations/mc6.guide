    We take absolutely no responsibility whatever the buttons below may
 cause to your health, sanity, grandma or something else, if you press 'em.
    If you are not interested in your life as it is now, just go ahead.
                    You will never be the same. Never.

                           YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Bones Goes To Hollywood " system "data/0a.dat data/61.dat blank reltime 5"}

 The Undead have penetrated the defenses of united states and terrorize the
 crucified hollywood world! No low quality or tasteless romance comedies
 produced anymore but lots of bone munching horrors. Shiver me timbers!
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" JouluYo " system "data/0a.dat data/62.dat blank reltime 5"}

 The halluciogenic reindeers ride the skies of doom as the world
 (as we once knew it) is sinking to the bottomless pits of chaotic
 eternity. Even Santa Claus has gone under a perpetual transformation
 process. The rotten fruits from the forbidden tree will contamine
 the souls and genetic structures of our children... for evermore!
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" KeskusHangaari " system "data/0a.dat data/63.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Unarmed helicopters waiting for crash, as their fuel runs out. There
 is no change for refuel as the Aliens have conquered the base, constantly
 producing their own unhealthy devices. For us humans, victimized that is.
 Carved, bruised, hacked, slashed and burned to infernal death.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" KolmioDraama " system "data/0a.dat data/64.dat blank reltime 3"}

 When the humanity and the spawn of the Ancient Ones will recognize each
 other, there is no survivors in this Triangle of Madness. This vision
 sadly demonstrates how we pathetic, jealous humans can never participate
 with the Aliens looking for long-lasting relationships. For the poor
 Alien, there is no way but to try to get rid of the jealous humans. Only
 never ending Gehenna awaits our extincting races.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Merry Madness " system "data/0a.dat data/65.dat blank reltime 8"}

 Bloodstained metal structures lure the Aliens and long-gone Spirits
 to their vicinity. In this territory humans are just feast for the
 shredders and occult symbols of Ancient China dominate the balance of
 jolly horror and morbid happiness.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Run Back... " system "data/0a.dat data/66.dat blank reltime 8"}

 Curse of the Pharaohs this is. The rape of their very graves is finally
 being avenged. Wicked spells from other dimensions twisting the reality of
 our time. Spineless humans vibrating like jelly, as slimy, brainsucking
 Insects rule the world. You touched, you stole - You disturbed the
 Dreaming Gods. It's the long-awaited retribution time.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Shampoo Dreams " system "data/0a.dat data/67.dat blank reltime 10"}

 The new designs of Vidal Sassoon in their way to new world order.
 Getting halluciogenic from the Shampoo, destroying your mental
 capacity until there is nothing left. Cunning is the way of this
 new drug to the unsuspecting customers, horrifying is the way your
 braincells rot. This is the future Multinational Corporations behold.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" V{riLeikki " system "data/0a.dat data/68.dat blank reltime 8"}

 Do you remember "Them" from Epsilon Eridani? Their ghostly dances
 and Their hollow chants? Well, Their peace was disturbed and now
 They enjoy Their existence in a brand new Binary System. Watch this
 show of inhuman harmony. Ancient it was when the earth was still young.

@node story "A meeting in the Park"
@toc menu
Thursday 6th October 1994
(C) JIP

TG's note: This is the very first publicly released play by JIP the
           adorable. It's copyrighted, but you are allowed to make it real
           for non-profit purposes. For example, if you need to arrange a
           play at your school, you may use this script.

           I'm not going to tell you how dangerous this insane meeting
           is. See for yourself.


                A Meeting in the Park
                        (a play)


The scene is the Kaisaniemi park in Helsinki. A hot-dog stand is visible,
whose owner is busy kicking bacilli out of his ears. The hot-dogs are
chanting "15 Men on the Dead Man's Chest, etc". The trees are constantly and
seemingly endlessly dropping their leaves. Mairiam arrives on the scene with
Sven the Hen.

Mairiam: Ooh, isn't it such a lovely day? (glances at watch) I mean night.
Sven the Hen (amiably): #*+@
Hot-dog vendor: Greetings, my dear lady.
Harlequin Harry appears out of a bus, which suddenly explodes in a massive
nuclear blast.
Harlequin Harry: Heellee, Meereem eend Sveen thee Heen.
Mairiam: Ooh, it's Harlequin Harry, I've read SO much about you.
Sven the Hen (bored): +*@#
Harlequin Harry: Heev yee eendeed? Theet's streeng, beecees neetheeng hees
been wreetn eebeet mee.
Mairiam: Ooh, but that's just a phrase, isn't it?
Sven the Hen (dumbly): *#+@

The Sun sets, and the Moon rises. The luminance level of the park decreases
drastically.
Mairiam: Ooh, it's cold here.
A bunch of Neo-Nazis arrive. They seem to be kicking invisible noses and
shouting vulgarities in Hindi.
Harlequin Harry: Wee'd beetteer deeg ee heel heer, see wee ceen bee seef
freem thees Nee-Neezees.
Sven the Hen (excited): #+@*
Mairiam, Harlequin Harry and Sven the Hen dig a hole. As they do so, the
Kaisaniemi park changes to le Place Dauphine in Paris.
Neo-Nazi one: Punar vadatiti kanya apagacchati.
Neo-Nazi two: Nrpasya asvodattam.

Mairiam: Ooh, but that didn't help, did it? The park's changed.
Sven the Hen (frustrated): +@*#
Harlequin Harry urinates into a small cavity one of his hairs has created.
The urine disrupts the delicate structure of space-time and causes the Dark
Emperor to appear.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Mairiam: Ooh, if it isn't the Dark Emperor. I've read SO much about you.
Harlequin Harry: Deen't leek nee, beet eet's thee Deek Eempeereer.
Sven the Hen (gaily): #+@*

The Dark Emperor and Harlequin Harry are having tea together in the hole.
Ottoman Ibn bounces into the hole and smashes the teacups.
Harlequin Harry: Nee jeest leek eet wheet yee'v deen.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Sven the Hen (idiotically): +#*@
Ottoman Ibn: Oh, I'm sorry. (scrubs a finger. The teacups dance a wild dance,
and mysteriously turn intact again.)
Mairiam: Ooh, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but shouldn't we get out of this
hole?
Ottoman Ibn: Well, yes.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Ottoman Ibn lifts a finger, and the hole fills with dirt. The Place Dauphine
changes to Olympos Mons on Mars.

Mairiam begins to grow peas on the Martian surface. The peas grow happily
enough, save for a vivid cyan colour.
Mairiam: Ooh, aren't these peas just lovely? (Eats a pea) Mmm... aah!
Ottoman Ibn: Let me try some. (Eats another pea) Well, yes, they're good.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Sven the Hen (jollily): +#@*
Harlequin Harry: Wheet eer wee deeng een Meers? Sheeldn't wee geet beeck tee
Eerth?
Mairiam: Ooh, I would say so, yes.
Ottoman Ibn: I'll fix that.
Ottoman Ibn twirls his hair backwards, and the Olympos Mons changes to Hyde
Park in London.

Ottoman Ibn: Well that fixes that.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Sven the Hen (lovingly): #*+@
Mairiam kicks the Dark Emperor in the knee. The Dark Emperor remains intact
but the act causes the fake Dark Emperor to appear.

Fake Dark Emperor: Hullo, wee laddies and lassies.
Mairiam: Ooh, but who is he? The Dark Emperor is by my side.
Ottoman Ibn: That is the fake Dark Emperor.
Fake Dark Emperor: What are ye a-doing in these parts, me hearties? (pours
honey out of his bagpipe)
Mairiam: Ooh, we're just visiting here.
Harlequin Harry: Yees, eendeed wee eer.
Sven the Hen (musingly): +#@*
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Fake Dark Emperor: Will ye shut up? (Points to the Dark Emperor) I be
a-conversating with these here English people.
Ottoman Ibn: I'm not English, I'm from Turkey.
Mairiam: Ooh, and I'm not English either, I'm French.
Harlequin Harry: Ee eem neet Eengleesh. Beet ee deen't knee mee
neeteeneeleetee.
Sven the Hen (nauseatingly): #+*@

Ottoman Ibn: Hey, you there! (Points to the Fake Dark Emperor) Is there a
way out of this mad place?
Fake Dark Emperor: Aye, indeed thar be one. Would ye like to use it?
Ottoman Ibn: Well, we'll have to vote on that.
Mairiam: Ooh, I want to get out of here.
Harlequin Harry: Mee tee.
Sven the Hen (oppressively): +#@*
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Fake Dark Emperor: Fine then, me lad. We shall get out of this here place
and back to the good auld Highlands.
The Fake Dark Emperor waves a finger, and Mairiam, Sven the Hen, Harlequin
Harry, Ottoman Ibn, the Dark Emperor and the fake Dark Emperor all disappear
in a fluff of smoke. The hot-dog vendor and the Neo-Nazis come back.
Hot-dog vendor: Well that sure was mysterious. But now I shall go to bed.
Neo-Nazi one: Yatha vrksastatha phalam.
Neo-Nazi two: Na gardabo gayati siksito 'pi.

The End.
