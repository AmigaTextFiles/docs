Welcome to the preview issue of "Vexx Digital Comix"... This is planned to
be a continuing saga starring all the great characters created by Danny
Santos AKA Vexx. In this particular issue, none of Vexx'x characters are
used, instead "skid <Richard Lugo AKA Skid Vis>" And "Xen <Edgardo Ortiz
AKA Xen>" are used instead, further issues will include these and MANY
original characters created by Vexx, Skid, and Xen. We hope you enjoy this
preview.
