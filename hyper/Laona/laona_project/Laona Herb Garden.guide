@{b}PANO AKOURDALIA CHRYSELEOUSA HERB GARDEN@{ub}

Welcome ...  to our collection of aromatic and medicinal plants of @{"Cyprus" LINK "Pix/Cyprus/Main" 0}.

There  are over forty species planted in the garden of the restored village
school-house,  and  with  the  exception  of  only  four,  these are plants
indigenous to  @{"Cyprus" LINK "Pix/Cyprus/Main" 0}, found growing naturally on the island.  Indeed, six
of the plants are endemics, @{"Cyprus" LINK "Pix/Cyprus/Main" 0} being their only natural home.

The main text of this guide consists of a description for each plant in the
garden, covering the appearance, habitat in @{"Cyprus" LINK "Pix/Cyprus/Main" 0}, and medicinal, culinary
and  other  properties or uses of each plant.  Please do not try any of the
medicinal  recipes  quoted,  as many of these are based on folk-lore rather
than  medical  science!   In the garden, each species is signposted, to aid
identification.

Most  of  the  plants in the garden are aromatics, they manufacture oils of
rich fragrance which have a function in helping them survive the hot summer
drought  of  the  Mediterranean climate.  The oils act to reduce water loss
from  the  leaves  by  slowing  evaporation  and  coating the leaves with a
protective  film.   The  oils  also seeem to retard the growth of seedlings
near  the  plant,  thus ensuring that there are no competitors for precious
soil  water  in  its  immediate  surroundings.  These same oils also afford
protection   from   grazers,   as   most  animals  find  them  distasteful.
Appropriately,  concentrations  of  these  essential  oils  peak during the
stressful summer season.

Aromatic  plants are common in thickets of tall shrubs with scattered trees
(@{i}maquis  vegetation@{ui})  or  areas  of  scattered,  low, spiny vegetation with
patches  of bare ground in between (@{i}garigue@{ui}) where conditions are too harsh
for  forest  growth.   Man's  activities  in  clearing forests, burning and
introducing  grazing  animals  have  served  to greatly increase maquis and
garigue vegetation, at the expense of forest, in @{"Cyprus" LINK "Pix/Cyprus/Main" 0}.  Suitable habitat
for aromatic  plants is thus probably more common now in @{"Cyprus" LINK "Pix/Cyprus/Main" 0} than under
the natural, original, conditions of more forest cover.  None the less, the
habitats  of  many  of  the  plant  species in the museum are threatened by
modern  development, fire, overgrazing, overcultivation or re-afforestation
with  non-native  trees.   The conservation of these plants is vital to the
maintenanced if a high biodiversity, and thus produtivity and stability, in
the  Cypriot ecosystem.   These plants also have great potential for use in
medical science.

Herbs, defined by herbalists as plants with medicinal properties, have been
used by man since the days of hunter-gathering.  Their primitive "trial and
error"  use  of  herbs  developed further with the birth of agriculture and
through trade and scholarship.

Herbs  were  widely  used  by  the  ancient  Egyptians,  Greeks and Romans.
Herbalists  were  prominent  in  the middle ages, publishing many 'Herbals'
referring to the medicinal properties of plants.  The use of herbs declined
with  the  beginning  of  the Industrial Revolution, but today their use is
having  a  revival  as  part  if  the  growing interest in natural medicine
(@{i}including  atomatherapy@{ui}).   Many  old  herbal  remedies  have  been proven
invalid,  while  others have been revived.  Herb extracts are still used in
modern medicine.

To the back of the garden museum is the Pano Akourdalia communtiy herb plot
where  lemon  balm, thyme, oregano, peppermint, sage and lavender are grown
to be dried and sold in the old school-house.  At the back of the guide are
some recipe ideas using these herbs.

The  Chryseleousa Herb Garden is owned by the Pano Akourdalia community and
was set up with the aid of the @{"Laona Project" link "Laona Project" 0}.

@{b}THE LAONA PROJECT@{ub}

The  Laona  Project  was  conceived  by  Friends of the Earth (@{i}@{"Cyprus" LINK "Pix/Cyprus/Main" 0}@{ui}) to
demonstrate the feasibility of ecologically sound development in an area of
outstanding  natural  beauty,  the  Akamas  Peninsula  and the nearby Laona
Plateau.

Securing  the  interests  of  the  local  people is vital to the successful
protection  of  this  unique  and beautiful region, so the Laona Project is
seeking  to  revitalise  the  declining  economies  of  nearly  villages by
introducing sustainable development.

Rather  than  constructing new mass-tourist complexes which would devastate
this  fragile environment and swamp traditional cultural and social values,
the project is pioneering an alternative strategy in which local people are
offered  technical  and  financial  assistance  to  enable  them to restore
traditional   properties   in   existing  villages,  for  uses  as  visitor
accommodation  and for associated small-scale industry.  The Project itself
is also seeking to improve the local agricultural base.

Responsibilty  for the Project rests with the Foundation for the Revival of
Laona,  which  is  funded  by  the  European  Commission (@{i}DGXI, MEDSPA\LIFE
Programme@{ui}), the A.G.Leventis Foundation and other Cypriot supporters.

@toc "Plants"

SUMACH (@{i}Rhus coriaria@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Rhus_coriaria/Main" 0}: This  is  a  shrub  1-3 metres tall, with toothed leaflets
smooth above and velvety  below,  reddening  in autumn.  Branches and leaf
stalks are hairy. Juice  is  milky  and  flowers whitish in long dense erect
spikes appearing from  June to July.  Fruit clustered in a spike of globular
berries, brown, purple and hairy.

Habitat: Locally  common  in  the  Troodos  range in vineyards and on stony
mountain sides from 2,000 ft to 6,000 ft.

Uses\Properties: The fruits of the sumach are eaten like capers in the
Eastern Mediterranean and  also  used  as  a  spice,  in for example
souvlaki.  Dried fruits used against  diarrhoea  and in the treatment of
dermatitis.  Tons of leaves are collected  every year and processed for the
production of a tan used in the preparation  of  leather  and  for the
making of a natural yellow dye.  The juice of this plant is poisonous.

@node "Terebinth" "Terebinth"
@toc "Plants"

TEREBINTH  (@{i}Pistacia Terebinthus@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Pistacia_terebinthus/Main" 0}: A  deciduous shrub with compound shiny leaves with a strong
resinous smell. Leaves of 4-5 pairs of leaflets and, unlike the similar
Pistacia Lentiscus, a  terminal  leaflet.   Flowers,  which  appear between
March and April, in close  compound  clusters,  reddish-purple  in  colour
growing from end of previous  years  shoot.  Fruit small, globular nutlets
which are brown when ripe.

Habitat: In  Cyprus the Terebinth is found growing on dry rocky slopes and
hillsides or  in  pine  forests, particularly in the Troodos and Kyrenia
ranges, from just above sea level to 4,000 ft.

Uses/properties: The fruits are used in the baking of a speciality village
bread.  The plant is  rich  in  tannin  and  resinous  substances  and has
been known for its aromatic  and  medicinal  properties  since  classical
times, Theophrastos described  the resin as having excellent fragrant and
setting qualities.  A mild  sweet scented gum can be produced from the
reddish bark and the large reddish  horn-like  galls  often  found  on  the
plant are used for tanning leather.  Terebinths are traditionally planted
over Armenian graves.

@node "Lentisk" "Lentisk"
@toc "Plants"

LENTISK OR MASTIC TREE (@{i}Pistacia Lentiscus@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Pistacia_lentiscus/Main" 0}: An  evergreen  shrub  or small tree with dark green leathery
leaves.  Whole plant  has  strongly  acrid  resinous  smell.  Flowers are
catkin like, and appear  between  February and May.  The fruit is a red then
black pea-sized berry.
  Habitat: Found  growing abundantly all over the Island from sea-level to
2,000 ft on sand  dunes,  dry  rocky  slopes and hillsides and in lowland
pine forests. Common member of maquis community.

Uses\Properties: Mastic,  used as a chewing gum for sweetening the breath
and preserving the gums  since  classical  times, is the resin of this
plant.  An oil used for illumination  and  cookery  is produced from the
berries in Arab countries, and  is also used in making "Masticha", a popular
sweetmeat and "Mastiche", a liqueur.  In Cyprus, the fruits are used in
sausage making and the leaves and  stems  are burned to smoke meats.  The
Lentisk is probably the balm of Genesis.

@node "Lemon Balm" "Lemon Balm"
@toc "Plants"

LEMON BALM (@{i}Melissa officinalis@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Melissa_officinalis/Main" 0}: An  erect  perennial  with  slightly  downy  lemon scented
leaves.  Whitish flowers tinged lilac in a lax flower head appear from May
to September.

Habitat: Found  in open rock-rose garigue, by roadsides or on cultivated
ground, but mostly in damp thickets or by stream sides from sea-level to
4,500 ft.

Uses\Properties: Extracts from lemon balm are said to have stimulant,
digestive and sedative properties,  and  to act as a tonic for the heart,
brain and peptic system. Lemon  balm  tea  is reputed to have blood pressure
normalising properties. In cooking, lemon balm is used for stuffings and in
egg dishes.  Though the flower  tubes of lemon balm are too long to allow
bees to forage, bees find a  paste  made  from  crushed  leaves
irresistible.  A swarm of bees can be attracted  to  a convenient locate by
smearing such a paste onto an object. Rubbing  the  hands  with lemon balm
prevents bees from stinging.  A strong decoction  of  fresh  leaves,  either
with other herbs or on its own adds a lovely  fragrance  to  bath  water. An
infusion of lemon balm soothes and softens  irritations of the skin and
smooths wrinkles.  Juice of leaves for bites.  Dried leaves in pot-pourri.

@node "Sideritis" "Sideritis"
@toc "Plants"

SIDERITIS (@{i}Sideritis perfoliata@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Sideritis_perfoliata/Main" 0} An  erect  perennial,  with  woody  rootstock,  which  smells of
poppies if bruised.  Stems are tetragonal and clothed in long and short
hairs.  Leaves are  lance-shaped  and a crowded flower head of pale yellow
flowers appears between May and July.

Habitat: A  rare plant encountered in the Troodos and Limassol areas amongst
garigue or in vineyards on open chalk hillsides from 2,500 ft to 3,600 ft.

Uses\Properties: The  plant  has  been  used  as a substitute for tea and is
reputed to have tonic and anti-anaemic properties and also helps to induce
perspiration.

NOTE:   The generic name Origanum derives from Greek and means, "Joy of the
Mountains", relating to its usual habitat.
@endnode

@node "Oregano" "Oregano"
@toc "Plants"

OREGANO (@{i}Origanum dubium@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Origanum_Dubium/Main" 0}: A tetragonal stemmed, aromatic, perennial herb with small,
gland-dotted and egg-shaped  leaves with slightly toothed margins.  Flowers
appear from June to  September  in  a  dense  terminal  flower-head.   The
petals  are pale yellow-pink and form a two-lipped flower.

Habitat: Amongst  garigue  on  stony  dry hillsides and in mountainous
areas, always grows on igneous rocks from 2,000 ft to 4,000 ft.  Locally
common on Pyrgos and Akamas.

Uses\Properties: Oregano  for  medicinal  or culinary use is best collected
between July and October  when  the  fragrant  oil (@{i}olio origani@{ui})
concentration reaches its' maximum.   Olio  origani  contains  80%
carvacrol, 15% thymol and tannins. Oregano  is  used as an expectorant,
tonic, digestive and as an infusion in cases  of  respiratory  infections.
It  can  also  be used externally for massage  and  leaves  and  flowers  in
hot bath water are very relaxing and beneficial  for  the  skin.   In
cooking it is used to add flavour to meat dishes,  sausages, most Italian
dishes but particularly pizzas, salads, egg and vegetable dishes.

CYPRUS OREGANO (@{i}Origanum cordifolium@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Origanum_cordifolia/Main" 0}: An  aromatic  perennial  sub-shrub
with  wide, smooth, gland-dotted leaves often purplish in colour.  Flowers
purple or pinkish appearing between June and August.

Habitat: This  is  a  rare endemic plant of Cyprus, growing in moist rocky
gorges by mountain streams on igneous rocks between 1,500 ft and 3,000 ft.

Uses\Properties: Unknown, but probably similar to those of other origanums.
@endnode

@node "Marjoram" "Marjoram"
@toc "Plants"

MARJORAM (@{i}Origanum majorana@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Origanum_majorana/Main" 0}: An  aromatic  perennial much branched herb with dense compact
shape.  Small egg-shaped  grey-green  highly  aromatic  leaves.   The
flower-head  which appears  from  May  to October is terminal, the flowers
are reddish pink in colour and two-lipped.

Habitat: An  endemic  plant  of  Cyprus  growing  amongst  garigue on dry,
limestone hillsides or in open pine forests from sea level to 3,000 ft.

Uses\Properties: Marjoram   yields  the  essential  oils  terpineol  and
terpinene.   "Tsai Sapsishia"  which  is an infusion made from dry marjoram
leaves is regarded as very beneficial in cases of pharyngitis, tonsillitis
or the common cold. Also  used  as an expectorant and against dyspepsia. The
dry stems of this plant  are  used for making brooms in Cypriot villages.
Marjoram has a more subtle  taste  than oregano and is used similarly in
cooking.  Dried leaves are  often  added to pot pourri.  A fable has it that
Amaracus, perfumer or possibly  son  to Cinyras King of Cyprus,
metamorphosed into marjoram after his untimely death.

@node "Thyme" "Thyme"
@toc "Plants"

THYME (@{i}Thymus capitatus@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Thymus_capitatus/Main" 0}: A compact aromatic cushion-like shrublet with narrow glandular
leaves.  The pink  flowers  appear  between  May  and  October  grouped in
dense rounded terminal heads.

Habitat: Thyme is one of the dominant plants of garigue vegetation and is
common all over  Cyprus  from  sea  level  to  2,900  ft on dry rocky slopes
and waste ground,  occasionally on sand dunes or rocks by the sea.  The
rounded shape of  the plant acts to reduce water loss to a minimum allowing
it to survive long periods of drought undamaged.

Uses\Properties: Thyme  is  an  excellent  honey-yielding  plant.   The
plant was used as an incense  in  temples,  and  in  fact  its  name derives
from the Greek name "thymon"  which  means  to  fumigate.  Thyme is rich in
volatile oil (@{i}thyme oil@{ui})  and  has  been  widely  used  in medicine and
perfumery since ancient times.   It  was  used  by  the Egyptians as an
aroma and for embalming the dead.   Roman  soldiers  hoped  to  gain courage
and strength by bathing in water  containing thyme.  A beer and thyme soup
is reputed to be a cure for shyness.  The antiseptic properties and pleasant
smell of thyme oil make it an  ideal  ingredient  for cough syrups,
toothpastes and soaps.  It is also widely used in modern perfumery and
cosmetics and as a culinary herb.

CYPRUS THYME (@{i}Thymus integer@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Thymus_integer/Main" 0}: A  gnarled  aromatic  perennial  cushion-like subshrub.  Leaves
stalk-less, linear  with  long white hairs.  The flower-head, a small
terminal spike of pink  tubular  flowers, appears between March and June.
The whole plant is less than 10cm high.

Habitat: This  endemic species is common on the Troodos range and in the
Akamas area growing  on  rocky  hillsides,  in  cultivated land and under
pine trees on igneous formations from 300 ft to 5000 ft.

Uses\Properties: Like  T.capitatus,  T.integer  is  a good honey yielding
plant, rich in the ethereal oil thymol.  Its medicinal properties are thus
similar to those of T.capitatus.  Infusions from this plant can be used as
anti-pyretics and in cases  of  dysentery  and  diarrhoea.   Thymol  is  a
good  antiseptic and bactericide.

GERMANDER (@{i}Teucrium micropodioides@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Teucrium_micropoidoides/Main" 0}: A  mildly  aromatic  white  felted  perennial shrublet with a
compact domed shape.   Leaves  are  small and cottony.  The flowers, which
appear between April and July, are purplish or reddish in colour forming
dense, stalk-less heads.  Fruit egg-shaped nutlets .

Habitat: A  rather  common  endemic  species that grows in dry rocky areas,
derelict land,  clearings  in  forests  and,  less commonly, on sandy
seashores from sea-level to 2,800 ft.  Another member of the garigue.

Uses\Properties: Widely  employed  in Cypriot folk medicine.  Stomach aches
were helped with an  infusion  prepared  from  leaves  and  flower heads.
Also used against jaundice  and  liver  bile  disorders.   Its  medicinal
properties  can be attributed  to  its  high content of tannin, essential
oils, balsamatic and other aromatic compounds.

CALAMINT (@{i}Calamintha incana@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Calaminta_incana/Main" 0}: A  low  aromatic  perennial with tetragonal stems covered in
whitish hairs. Leaves  rounded  and hairy on both surfaces with a very
strong aroma.  From June  to  December pink or mauve flowers with purplish
nerves and a tubular shape appear.

Habitat: Grows  on  dry  rocky  ground, fallow fields, roadsides and
occasionally on sand dunes or by dried up streams and irrigation channels
from sea-level to 4,900 ft.

Uses\Properties: A  Cypriot  folk  remedy for nephritis and other kidney
disorders is, "boil one  handful  of  dry  leaves  in one oke of water
administer by mouth four times a day to sufferer for at least one week".
Kidney pain and colics can also be treated by rubbing externally with boiled

@node "Rosemary" "Rosemary"
@toc "Plants"

ROSEMARY (@{i}Rosmarinus officinalis@{ui})

@{"Appearance" LINK "Pix/Melissa_officinalis/Main" 0}: This is a dense, evergreen, aromatic, perennial shrub.  Leaves
are leathery and   folded   inwards  along  the  margins,  green  and  rough
above  and white-felted  below.   Flowers  which appear from January to
March (@{i}all the year round in cultivated varieties@{ui}) lilac pink in lax
clusters.

Habitat: Very  rare  as  a  wild  plant in Cyprus but is probably indigenous
between Yialousa  and  Ronnas  bay  on  the Karpas Peninsula, on maritime
rocks and fixed  sand  dunes  near  sea  level,  though  it  is  possible
that it was introduced  there  ,  accidentally,  in the remote past.  Widely
cultivated elsewhere on the island..

Uses\Properties: The flowers of rosemary are very attractive to bees and the
famous Narbonne honey  is  derived  largely  from  this  plant.   The
flowers and leaves of rosemary  are  rich  in  the  essential  oil,  olio
rosemarini, which is an essential  ingredient  of  Eau  de  Cologne, hair
lotions, cold creams etc. Plant  has antiseptic, tonic and insecticidal
properties.  An infusion from the  leaves  can  be  used  as  a  digestive.
Leaves  boiled  in wine are traditionally  used for bruising or arthritis.
In the middle ages "Hungary water",  a  preparation  for  rheumatism  using
rosemary invented for Queen Elizabeth  of  Hungary was extremely popular,
especially after it proved so revitalising  to  the  Queen  that  the  King
of Poland proposed marriage! Rosemary  was  also  used  to  fumigate
hospital wards in the Middle Ages. Rosemary  is  also  supposed to
strengthen the memory.  Students in ancient Greece  would  wear  garlands of
it around their heads during exams.  There may  be  some truth to these
theories as rosemary is now known to stimulate local  circulation.   In
modern medicine rosemary is used as a stimulant to the  circulation  and  a
tonic  to  the nervous system being excellent for relieving  headaches  and
migraines.  Externally it is useful in rheumatic complaints  and  for aiding
blood flow to the scalp in conditions of hair loss  or  dandruff. Rosemary
has always been seen as a plant of graves and cemeteries  in  many cultures
and  civilisations.   The Greeks and Romans regarded  it  as important  in
religious  ceremonies  and  as a symbol of fidelity.   In cookery rosemary
is sometimes used as a conserve or for jam making and also with roast meats
in stuffings marinades and egg dishes.  It is  also  good with sweeter
things such as jelly and fruit drinks and as a tea.

The  current  trend of "green" or natural living has subsequently led to an
increased usage of commercial herbal cosmetics, however, it works out to be
a lot cheaper if you make your own pure beauty products.

The following herbs can be used for face packs (@{i}see instructions below@{ui}) and
aid various skin conditions, with the following beneficial effects:

-  Lemon balm helps smooth wrinkles.

-  Thyme helps to clear acne and spots, it is also reasonably astringent.

-  Mint is excellent for cleansing ingrained dirt and spots. However, it is
   a  strong astringent so only half the recommended amount of herbs should
   be used in packs for sensitive skin.

All  of  the  above  herbs  also leave your skin feeling well refreshed and
cleansed.

- Face packs. These are easy to make and simple to use using the following
method:

1.  Chop 3-4 handfuls of fresh herbs.
2.  Put  them into a saucepan with boiling water with just enough to cover
    the herbs.
3.  Leave to simmer until the herbs form a thick mash.
4.  Leave to cool slightly.
5.  While mixture is still warm apply to face withcotton wool.  (@{i}NOTE:
    avoid applying to eyes and mouth@{ui}).
6.  Leave on for 10-15 minutes or until dry. 7.  Rinse off with lukewarm
    water and pat skin dry.

Do not expect instant results.
