 Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right.
 Jacking themselves off polyester.

 Fiberglass insulated, the sky is cotton candy.
 Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate.
 Feeling can't help me romp
 Bill just fuck me, take me anal

 She's only five weeks late,

 more chances to remember some things
 so I couldn't have so much pressure on my...
 on my...on my, um...ah, on my...um...um...head.
