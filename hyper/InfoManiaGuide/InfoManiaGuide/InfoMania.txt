1.	InfoMania command guide

 infobot@infomania.com

Welcome to the new InfoMania information-by-mail server.  This server is a
complete replacement for the one that ran at netcom.com.  In addition, it is
acting as a job-tracker for InfoMania customers.

To send personal e-mail to the previous owners of this server:

	e-mail jfesler@crl.com for Jason Fesler
	e-mail dlangley@crl.com for Doug Langley

To comment about this server, you will want to direct your comments to

	jfesler@infomania.com instead.


InfoMania customers:

E-mail status@infomania.com with your job number on the subject line.  The
current status of your job will be returned back to you.  You are also more than
welcome to experiment with the other mail-server functions documented below.

If you know of other easy-to-get information on the Internet, that's only a
small command away, and would like to see it added to the list of commands
above, send me e-mail -- if it's reasonable, I'll add it in!

Note, that these files are available at ftp.netcom.com:/pub/jfesler/ ...  If you
have ftp abilities, please use that method instead of the mail server, as the
overhead is far less.

3.	The ACRONYM command

 Acronym {word or acronym}

	This function will check a server that contains many of todays often
used acronyms.	You can search for a word (i.e., big, large, etc), or a specific
acronym.


4.	The ARCHIE command

 Archie {options}

	This function has been removed due to archie servers world wide failing.
The load caused by the failing archie servers has been unacceptable :-( .  Use
the ARCHIE function to get info on where to send e-mail.


5.	The ALMANAC command

 Almanac

	This command "finger"s copi@oddjob.uchicago.edu to do it's dirty work.
A lot of interesting information that changes from day to day is here.


6.	The AREA command

 Area {city or country name, or telephone code}

	This function accesses a server which contains most, if not all, of the
telephone area codes and country codes around the world.  Example searches would
be AREA 916 or AREA NETHERLANDS.  Good way of finding out what area code someone
is in, also a good way of finding out where someone lives by their telephone
number.


7.	The CALLINFO command

 CallInfo

	Returns information about the ham radio call-sign lookup server being
operated via telnet callsign.cs.buffalo.edu 2000...


8.	The CALLHELP command

 CallHelp

	Returns help instructions on ways of narrowing down your searches with
the ham radio functions.  It mentions how to limit by location, name, etc.


9.	The CALLNAME command

 CallName {partial name of ham radio operator}

	Looks up the ham radio call sign database for anybody with the name that
you specify.


10.	The CALLSIGN command

 CallSign {ham call sign}

	Looks up a ham radio call sign, and tells you who it belongs to, where
they live, etc.  Handy if you hear an unfamiliar call over the radio.


11.	The CALLZIP command

 CallZip {zipcode}

	Looks up all ham radio users for the zipcode that you specify.


12.	The CHEF command

 Chef {msg body}

	Thees veell cunfert yuoor messege-a budy tu meke-a it luuk leeke-a it
ves perheps vreettee by zee Svedeesh Cheff, frum zee Mooppets.	It cun teke-a
uny sereeuoos text, und toorn it intu a rezeer hoomuooruoos ferseeun ooff zee
ooreeginel.  Bork Bork Bork!


13.	The DIG command

 Dig {options}

	Runs the name service lookup program.  You may either specify options on
the subject line, or may use the message body; in the second case, InfoBot will
pretend you were typing all of that stuff straight into dig.  Mainly for
sysadmins who want to confirm their own name service dæmons are working
correctly.  To get instructions on it's syntax, e-mail man@infomania.com, with a
subject of "dig".


14.	The FINDCD command

 FindCD {searchString}

	This function allows you to search for your favorite author or title
through a catalog of CD's.  Only one search string is allowed per search
(hopefully, I'll make a real program to handle this later).  An example would be
FINDCD Pink Floyd or FINDCD Dark Side.	Search results will be limited to 40k;
also, you'll get an advertisement at the end on how to get the complete catalog
via ftp, as well as how you can order some of these CD's via a local merchant.
The rates are usually pretty decent compared to the local stores, and this guy
delivers...  :-)  The entire catalog can be FTP'd from
ftp.netcom.org:/pub/recplace/ ...


15.	The FINGER command

 Finger {user}

	This command will allow you to "finger" any user or site on the Internet
that is fingerable.  The results will be sent back as e-mail.  This is
primarilly for people who have only mail access to the Internet; many good
things are available, but only by fingering various addresses.	For more
information, e-mail infobot@infomania.com, subject: man finger


16.	The FX command

 FX

	If you want the latest copy of FX-UUCICO,along with any associated FAQ
files, etc, sent to your e-mail address, use this command.  You will need a copy
of uudecode to interpret these messages.


17.	The GEEK command

 Geek

	This command returns the current version of the Code of the Geeks.


18.	The JARGON command

 Jargon {word}

	This command will check the Hacker's Jargon File v2.99 [April 1992], for
the word you specify.  Most entries are of humourous nature.  One such word you
want to try is JARGON pizza ...

	If you do not specify a word, this function will return back an index of
all searchable keywords.  Use this if you are just browsing.


19.	The LOAD command

 Load

	This command is useless for anyone who is not at Infomania.  Why it's
made public, I have no idea.  Really!


20.	The MAN command

 Man {programName}

	This is an extremely redundant one.  Most people who have need for the
man pages, will have access to a "man" command on their system.  However, just
in case this proves useful to someone...  You can ask for man pages via e-mail.
A sample request would be MAN sz to get help on the "sz" program.


21.	The NSLOOKUP command

 NSLookUp {options}

	Runs the name service lookup program.  You may either specify options on
the subject line, or may use the message body; in the second case, InfoBot will
pretend you were typing all of that stuff straight into nslookup.  Mainly for
sysadmins who want to confirm their own name service dæmons are working
correctly.  To get instructions on it's syntax, e-mail man@infomania.com, with a
subject of "nslookup".


22.	The PDIAL command

 PDial {searchString} [Defaults to returning ENTIRE PDIAL list]

	This command will allow you to retrieve the latest PDIAL public access
list maintained by Peter Kaminski (kaminski@netcom.com).  If no options
specified, the entire list is sent back (circa 70k).

	You are allowed to specify a search string, such as an areacode.  If
given, you will be given only the relevant providers related to the search.
I.e., PDIAL 916 will return all 916 area providers.  PDIAL 212 SLIP will return
all SLIP providers in the 212 area code.  PDIAL NETCOM will return info about
netcom.com.

	Peter Kaminski has given his express permission to use his list via this
function.


23.	The PI command

 PI

	This function will return to you via e-mail the value of PI, to several
hundred digits accuracy.  The resulting message will be approximately 20-30k
long.


24.	The PING command

 Ping

	Tells infomania.com to "ping" another site on the Internet.  Useful for
administrators trying to make sure that their site is reachable when the
connections are questionable, i.e. after wide area route reconfiguration, etc.
(Note: traceroute is not available, please don't ask.  Sorry!).  To get
instructions on it's syntax, e-mail man@infomania.com, with a subject of
"ping".


25.	The ROOT2 command

 Root2

	This function will return to you via e-mail the value of the square root
of 2, to several hundred digits accuracy.  The resulting message will be
approximately 20-30k.


26.	The STATUS command

 Status {job number} [This is only for customers of InfoMania]

	This function will allow you to check on the status of a scanning or
output job that we are doing for you.  You will see a journal log of who has
worked on your job, with any discertations that may have been made.  On request
and at no additional charge, this same information can be e-mailed to you
whenever we make an update to your job's journal.  Ask us for details, or write
down your e-mail address on your order form in the "Special Instructions" box.


27.	The TOPTEN command

 TopTen

	The David Letterman Top Ten List; sends back the latest list actually
broadcast by the television network.


28.	The WEATHER command

 Weather {abr} WX {abr}

	Include a 3 letter city abbreviation, or a 2 letter state abbreviation.
This works on USA and Canadian locations.  Specify WEATHER HELP or WX HELP if
you would like help instructions.  Various things from current conditions and
forcasts to ski reports and earthquake data are available.


29.	The WEBSTER command

 Webster {word}

	This command will allow you to look up any word in the English language.
If you have a list of words, you may instead leave the {word} field blank, and
use the message body (one word per line, no blank lines).  If you can not get
the list method to work, go back to a single message per request.


30.	The WHOIS command

 WhoIs {options} {siteName}

	This command will run the standard "whois" client program, querying the
InterNic for the domain name registration information for the given site name.
For more details, e-mail infobot@infomania.com, subject "man whois".


31.	The HELP command
