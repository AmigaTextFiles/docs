Welcome to the new InfoMania information-by-mail server.  This server is a
complete replacement for the one that ran at netcom.com.  In addition, it is
acting as a job-tracker for InfoMania customers.

To send *personal email* to the previous owners of this server:
    email jfesler@crl.com for  Jason Fesler
    email dlangley@crl.com for Doug Langley
To comment about this server, you will want to direct your comments to 
jfesler@infomania.com instead.

InfoMania! Customers:

Email "status@infomania.com"  with your job number on the subject line.  The
current status of your job will be returned back to you.  You are also more
than welcome to experiment with the other mail-server functions documented
below.

if you have ftp abilities, please use that method instead of the mail
server, as the overhead is far less.

Extra Notes:

ACRONYM {word or acronym}
  This function will check a server that contains many of todays often used
acronyms.  You can search for a word (ie, big, large, etc), or a specific
acronym.

ARCHIE {options}
  This function has been removed due to archie servers world wide 
failing.  The load caused by the failing archie servers has been 
unacceptable :-(.  Use the ARCHIE function to get info on where to send
email.

ALMANAC 
  This command "finger"s copi@oddjob.uchicago.edu to do it's dirty work.  A
lot of interesting information that changes from day to day is here.

AREA {city or country name, or telephone code}
  This function accesses a server which contains most, if not all, of the
telephone area codes and country codes around the world.  Example searches
would be AREA 916 or AREA NETHERLANDS.  Good way of finding out what area
code someone is in, also a good way of finding out where someone lives by
their telephone number.

CALLINFO
  Returns information about the ham radio call-sign lookup server
being operated via telnet callsign.cs.buffalo.edu 2000..

CALLHELP
  Returns help instructions on ways of narrowing down your searches with 
the ham radio functions.  It mentions how to limit by location, name, etc.

CALLNAME {partial name of ham radio operator}
  Looks up the ham radio call sign database for anybody with the name that
you specify.

CALLSIGN {ham call sign}
  Looks up a ham radio call sign, and tells you who it belongs to, where
they live, etc.  Handy if you hear an unfamiliar call over the radio.

CALLZIP {zipcode}
  Looks up all ham radio users for the zipcode that you specify.

CHEF {msg body}
  Thees veell cunfert yuoor messege-a budy tu meke-a it luuk 
leeke-a it ves perheps vreettee by zee Svedeesh Cheff, frum zee Mooppets.  
It cun teke-a uny sereeuoos text, und toorn it intu a rezeer hoomuooruoos 
ferseeun ooff zee ooreeginel.  Bork Bork Bork!

DIG {options}
 Runs the name service lookup program.  You may either specify options ont
he subject line, or may use the message body; in the second case, InfoBot
will pretend you were typing all of that stuff straight into dig. Mainly for
sysadmins who want to confirm their own name service daemons are working
correctly.  To get instructions on it's syntax, email man@infomania.com,
with a subject of "dig".


FINDCD {searchstring}
  This function allows you to search for your favorite author or
title through a catalog of CD's.  Only one search string is allowed per
search (hopefully, I'll make a _real_ program to handle this later).  An
example would be FINDCD Pink Floyd  or  FINDCD Dark Side.   Search results
will be limited to 40k; also, you'll get an advertisement at the end on how
to get the complete catalog via ftp, as well as how you can order some of
these CD's via a local merchant.  The rates are usually pretty decent
compared to the local stores, and this guy delivers.. :-)   The entire
catalog can be FTP'd from  ftp.netcom.org:/pub/recplace/ .. 

FINGER {user}
  This command will allow you to "finger" any user or site on the internet
that is fingerable.  The results will be sent back as email.  This is
primarilly for people who have only mail access to the internet; many good
things are available, but only by fingering various addresses.  For more
information, email infobot@infomania.com, subject: man finger

FX 
  If you want the latest copy of FX-UUCICO,along with any associated FAQ
files, etc, sent to your email address, use this command.  You will need a
copy of uudecode to interpret these messages.

GEEK
  This command returns the current version of the Code of the Geeks.


JARGON  {word}
  This command will check the Hacker's Jargon File v2.99 [April 1992], 
for the word you specify.  Most entries are of humourous nature.  One such
word you want to try is JARGON PIZZA ..
  If you do not specify a word, this function will return back an index of
all searchable keywords.  Use this if you are just browsing.

LOAD
  This command is useless for anyone who is not at Infomania.  Why it's made
public, I have no idea.  Really!

MAN {programname}
  This is an extremely redundant one.  Most people who have need for the man
pages, will have access to a "man" command on their system.  However, just
in case this proves useful to someone.. you can ask for man pages via email. 
A sample request would be MAN sz  to get help on the "sz" program.

NSLOOKUP {options} Runs the name service lookup program.  You may either
specify options ont he subject line, or may use the message body; in the
second case, InfoBot will pretend you were typing all of that stuff straight
into nslookup. Mainly for sysadmins who want to confirm their own name
service daemons are working correctly.  To get instructions on it's syntax,
email man@infomania.com, with a subject of "nslookup".

PDIAL {searchstring}    [Defaults to returning ENTIRE PDIAL list]
  This command will allow you to retrieve the latest PDIAL public access
list maintained by Peter Kaminski (kaminski@netcom.com).  If no options
specified, the entire list is sent back (circa 70k).  
  You ARE allowed to specify a search string, such as an areacode.  If
given, you will be given only the relavant providers related to the search. 
Ie, PDIAL 916 will return all 916 area providers.  PDIAL 212 SLIP will
return all SLIP providers in the 212 area code.  PDIAL NETCOM will return
info about netcom.com.
  Peter Kaminski has given his express permission to use his list via this
function.

PI 
  This function will return to you via email the value of PI, to several
hundred digits accuracy.  The resulting message will be approximately 20-30k
long.

PING
  Tells infomania.com to "ping" another site on the internet.  Useful for
administrators trying to make sure that their site is reachable when the
connections are questionable, ie after wide area route reconfiguration, etc.
(Note:  traceroute is _not_ available, please don't ask.  Sorry!)
To get instructions on it's syntax, email man@infomania.com, with
a subject of "ping". 

ROOT2
  This function will retiurn to you via email the value of the square root
of 2, to several hundred digits accuracy.  The resulting message will be
approximately 20-30k.

STATUS  {job number}      [This is only for customers of InfoMania]
  This function will allow you to check on the status of a scanning or
output job that we are doing for you.  You will see a journal log of who has
worked on your job, with any discertations that may have been made.  On
request and at no additional charge, this same information can be emailed to
you whenever we make an update to your job's journal.  Ask us for details, 
or write down your email address on your order form in the "Special
Instructions" box.

TOPTEN
  The David Letterman Top Ten List; sends back the latest list actually
broadcast by the television network.

WEATHER {abr}     
WX {abr}        
  Include a 3 letter city abbreviation, or a 2 letter state abbreviation. 
This works on USA and Canadien locations.  Specify WEATHER HELP or WX HELP
if you would like help instructions.  Various things from current conditions
and forcasts to ski reports and earthquake data are available.
 
WEBSTER {word}
  This command will allow you to look up any word in the English language. 
If you have a list of words, you may instead leave the {word} field blank,
and use the message body (one word per line,  _no_ blank lines).  If you can
not get the list method to work, go back to a single message per request.

WHOIS {options} {sitename}
  This command will run the standard "whois" client program, querying the
InterNic for the domain name registration information for the given site
name.  For more details, email infobot@infomania.com, subject "man whois".

HELP  
  You're reading it!

If you know of other easy-to-get information on the internet, that's only a
small command away, and would like to see it added to the list of commands
above, send me email -- if it's reasonable, I'll add it in!
