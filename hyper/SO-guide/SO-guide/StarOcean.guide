    Welcome to a comprehensive Amigaguide for Star Ocean the second
    story. First, I must make clear that this is a compilation of
    several other FAQs available on the web, and in particular
    gamefaqs.com . I am not ripping off other people's work! I have
    just decided to 'AmigaNise' those FAQs into something a little
    more useful for us!

    Please proceed to the @{"INDEX" link INDEX} to skip the boring
    update stuff.

    Also, I've added some @{"pictures" link PICTURES} for effect!

    This is the first release of the AmigaGuide to StarOcean.
    Still left to do:
                     Add the other half of the Claude FAQ.
                     Add the Rena FAQ.
                     Clean up some more of the text.

Notes:

-------


This is the preliminary version of my Star Ocean: The Second Story 

Claude's Scenario Walkthrough for the North American version of the 

game. This version covers the entire North American version of the 

game, and everything should be correctly translated. Make sure to 

let me know if anything is translated incorrectly for the English 

version of the game.


I have written an entire FAQ for Star Ocean: The Second Story in 

addition to this walkthrough. Make sure to get the FAQ along 

with this walkthrough, as it covers all of the things that are 

needed to know about the game, including Item Creation data, and 

such. I have translated my FAQ from the FAQ I originally made 

for the Japanese version of the game, so some things could still 

be translated incorrectly. I want to be as exact as possible, so 

contact me if I have made any mistakes. 


Also, I made both the Claude and Rena scenario strategy guides at 

the same time, so a lot of information is copy and pasted from 

here to there, as I made the walkthrough for Claude's scenario 

first. Since the game is very similar besides a few plot twists, 

there is a fair ammount of differences, but not too many. If you 

want to correct any false information I have given, please tell 

me as soon as possible.


I have made my Star Ocean: The Second Story FAQ to accompany this 

walkthrough. You can get my Star Ocean: The Second Story FAQ from 

one of two locations:


http://gannex.simplenet.com

http://www.gamefaqs.com


Many of the sections here are not complete yet, so I'm expecting 

having to update this guide very often, as I plan to make the 

most complete guide for this game on the internet. I welcome 

submissions to this guide, and if you would be kind enough to 

give me information that you have and I don't.


For any submissions you wish to make, be sure to mail me at 

<exdeath@earthlink.net>.


-There are many Pickpocket items that haven't been translated. It's 

very harde to find all of the items that can be pickpocketed, and 

until I pick up the official guide, I won't be able to translate 

them myself, because I don't have any idea what some of the items 

will be translated as. If you know what the proper translations are 

for any of the items I don't have the proper name for, please mail 

me. I appreciate any help I can get with this.


-I have started what will become a very large Private Actions List. 

I intend on finding all of the unique Private Actions in the game, 

and recording them here. If you have any *unique* Private Actions 

(ones that can only be done in certain parts of the game), please 

submit them to me. It is pretty small so far, but I have a lot of 

the more important Private Actions. Help on this section would be 

really great.

@NODE C-INTRODUCTION "Intro"

                               @{JCENTER}--------------


                                Introduction:


                               --------------


@{" image " LINK "extras/TITLE.ilbm/MAIN"}

@{JLEFT}Star Ocean: The Second Story is a unique Role Playing Game for the

Sony PlayStation console. Star Ocean: The Second Story is unique 

in its combat system, skills system, emotional system, and story. 


Star Ocean: The Second Story is actually the second Star Ocean 

game, the original Star Ocean was released on the Super Famicom 

in Japan in 1996. The original Star Ocean was a 48 megabyte cart, 

and used the full abilities of the Super Famicom. Star Ocean was 

made by Tri-Ace, and published by Enix (who is famed for many 

popular games including the tremendously popular Dragon Quest 

series of games). 


Star Ocean was one of the unique games, simply because it was so 

original for a Role Playing Game. Almost every Role Playing Game 

to date has used a turn-based type of system in combat, but Star 

Ocean came through to create a very unique active-time system in 

which everyone attacks and uses their abilities at the same time, 

making strategy in location a big aspect in battles.


Star Ocean: The Second Story begins 30 years after the original 

Star Ocean left off, when Ratix and his friends destroyed Jie 

Revors and restored peace to the world, and cured the Roakians 

of the stone disease. Claude is the son of Ronixis, who was made 

a hero by the Federation for his work with Ratix in destroying 

Jie Revors. The story begins when Ratix is on his father's ship, 

and later on an away team.


Star Ocean: The Second Story was made by Tri-Ace. Tri-Ace has 

made other great games like Tales of Phantasia. Tri-Ace has a 

great page that gives a lot of information about their games. 

Check their page out:


http://www.tri-ace.co.jp


Also, please note that Claude's name in the Japanese version of 

the game is Crawd. This is a translation I really don't agree 

on, but if I make any mistakes through this walkthrough and call 

him Crawd, please tell me. The reason I think this is a stupid

translation since at the end of the Japanese game in the credits 

it actually says his name is "Crawd" in English, so I don't really 

know what Sony was thinking when they made his name "Claude".

@NODE C-SO-GLOSSARY "Meet the Terms"



---------------------------------------


Star Ocean: The Second Story Glossary:


---------------------------------------


Star Ocean: The Second Story contains many Japanese terms that 

could confuse the player. Star Ocean: The Second Story is a big 

game, and you'll probably need to know most of these terms for 

the game, especially if you care about your character's ratings 

toward the other characters.


Aijodo (Love Level): The variable that measures a character's 

love toward another character. This value is used to determine 

pairings of opposite-sexed characters in the many endings.



Kanjodo (Emotion Level): The variable that measure's a character's 

feelings toward the other characters in the group. Encompasses 

Aijodo and Yujodo.


Kobutsu (Favorite): Favorite food or drink. The special foods 

and drinks can be used on the characters, and if it's their 

favorite, it will usually heal them to full HP every time.


Hissatsuwaza (Killer Moves): Refers to a special technique in a 

specific fighting style. They are gained through level-ups. Only 

the fighting-type characters can use Hissatsuwaza.


Item Creation: Star Ocean boasts a unique system of making your 

own items by mixing or customizing different other items. There are 

many different kinds of Item Creations, check the "Item Creation" 

section for more info.


Jukurendo (Proficiency): The level of each Hissatsuwaza and 

spell. Each time you use a Hissatsuwaza or spell, this number 

goes up by one, excluding the spells that don't increase at all.


Jumon: An individual spell. Pretty much the same as Monshojutsu.


Monshojutsu (Crest Skill): This is what magic is called in Star 

Ocean: The Second Story. The magic of the Star Ocean world. 



Private Action: A special part of the game in which characters 

split up and move into towns on their own, so you can associate 

with your own characters.


Skill Points: Points that each character gains after gaining a 

level. You can distribute these points on skills. Sometimes 

Preferred to as SP.


Super Tokugi (Super Specialty): A skill that characters possesses, 

Super Specialties are different because every party member helps 

to contribute to each individual use of a Super Specialty.



Tokugi (Specialty): A single skill a character possesses.


Zokusei: The type of attack/defense an item/weapon/armor/spell has, 

like Fire or Ice. 


Yujodo (Camaraderie Level): The variable that determines how

friendly characters are toward each other. This also has effect on 

the endings, it determines pairings of same-sex characters at the 

end.

@node CC-1 "The Beginning"


@{JCENTER}-------------

Walkthrough:

-------------

@{JLEFT}Here is the complete walkthrough for the North American version

of Star Ocean: The Second Story. This is obviously going to be 

the biggest section of this guide, and it should tell you all 

of the information you need to know about beating the game.



@{JCENTER}--Chapter 1: The Beginning of a Journey--



@{JLEFT}"The vast expanse of the universe caught the imagination of 10

billion people, and presented an unlimited number of possibilities 

to them. From these were born an uncountable number of dreams and 

aspirations. Of course, some of them are evil. That fact was confirmed 

in Sector Gamma when intelligent life forms from Planet Rezonia 

started a war with the Earth Federation and drew them into a violent 

series of battles. Universal Year 342. In that year, a man on the 

battleship Calnus led the way to victory against the Rezonia forces.

In Universal Year 342, he went to the undeveloped planet Roak, solved 

an incident involving a mysterious virus, and stopped the leader of 

Planet Fargett, Jie Revorse, who was controlling Rezonia behind the 

scenes. In reward for his merits, at the young age of 38, he was 

promoted to Admiral. I respected my father for that more than anybody. 

I grew up believing that being an officer of the Federation was a 

wonderful thing to do. But I am myself. I am not just a puppet of the 

Federation as the son of Admiral Ronixis J. Kenni. But, here I am 

now..."




After watching the opening cut scene and spoken text, the game opens 

with Ronixis, Claude, and other crew members investigating a newly 

found planet, Mirokinia. The crew finds that there is a very large 

energy field on the planet. The crew's ship, the Calnus, fires many 

rays at the planet, but it is absorbing them all. Ronixis talks to 

Claude about what is happening and gives you a Phase Gun Killer Move. 

Ronixis and Claude decide to take an away party and beam down to the 

planet to investigate. The away team beams down to the planet, and 

Ronixis decides that the crew should take a look at a large dome.



When upon reaching the dome, the party splits up and attempts to look 

for a way to open the door. Walk to the control panel and press the 

action button. Claude calls Ronixis about it, and the officers attempt 

to work on opening the dome. The crew eventually is able to open the 

huge dome, and steps inside. Walk towards the dome. Ronixis warns 

Claude to not go any farther, but Claude goes ahead anyway. Claude 

finds a pod of some sort. The pod emits a bunch of coordinates and 

says "Opening gate". Claude gets sucked into the pod and is taken 

from the planet. Ronixis and the chief science officer run up to the 

place Claude was, and Ronixis blames himself.


Claude finds himself in a forest. Claude calls around, but none of 

the others are there. Claude even attempts to contact the ship from 

his communicator, to no avail. Claude realizes that he is in trouble, 

and that he needs to figure out where he is. Claude believes that 

this planet is fairly a non-technological planet, because of all of 

his surroundings. Claude just beings to walk out of the forest area 

when he spots a girl with blue hair, and he sees that a gorilla is 

about to attack the girl from behind. Claude runs forward and engages 

in attack with the gorilla.




Boss: Gark

HP: 2,000

No strengths or weaknesses



This isn't really a boss, but you cannot damage Gark with your normal 

attack. Just use the Phase Gun Killer Move that Ronixis gave you on 

the Calnus. Just keep shooting the Phase Gun until Gark is gone, as 

it will only take about three shots.



After slaying Gark, Claude realizes that he used his Phase Gun and 

begins to worry that he has broken the "Underdeveloped Planet 

Protection Treaty". Claude asks if the girl is alright, and the 

girl eventually becomes scared and runs away. Go to the next screen, 

and the girl apologizes to Claude for running away, and tells Claude 

that she was just very scared. The girl introduces herself as Rena 

Lanford, and Claude introduces himself to her. Claude asks where he 

is, and the girl is very confused. 



The two start walking about to town. On the way back, @{" RENA " LINK "extras/Rena.ilbm/MAIN"} asks where

Claude is from, and Claude says that he is from Earth. Rena asks what 

he is talking about, and Claude tells her not to mind, and just says 

that it is in a far off land. When the two enter the town, Rena tells 

Claude that this is her hometown, Arlia. Rena tells that she is going 

back to her house, and tells you to visit around the town and get to 

know the place that she lives in.




Arlia

*Items in Arlia: 

Rose Hips, Leather Armor, 200 Fol, Resurrection Bottle, Strawberry 

Jam, Blackberry



*Pickpocket Data: 

Blackberry, 10 Fol, Rainbow Diamond, Sour Syrup, 100V, Blueberry, 

24 Fol, Stone, Ichigo Jam Resurrect Bottle, Fried Eggs, Vegetables, 

Necklace, 100 Fol, Silver Cross, 120 Fol, Idaten Ship.



*Village Information:

Arlia is a pretty average town, and no one in the village knows 

anything about anything that Claude has to talk about. The people 

pretty much only talk about how you look different and how Arlia 

is very average.


Go around through the village, collecting the various treasures 

make sure to look in the houses as well), and talking to all of

the people here. 



Next, go to Rena's house. Rena is just talking to her mother when 

you enter. Rena is surprised that you are here, and Claude just 

said he ended up at her house. Rena welcomes Claude into her home 

and introduces him to her mother, Westa. Westa talks about how 

she told Rena not to run away, but often does anyway. Rena offers 

to give Claude a tour of the town, and Claude accepts. Now, if you 

go into the various houses in the village, Rena will tell you about 

the different areas of the village and what she does here. 



After you are finished, go back to Rena's house. Westa makes a meal 

for Rena and Claude to eat. After you are finished eating, Rena 

talks to Claude about how her mother made too much food, and then 

she goes downstairs to help her mother with housework. Claude thinks 

about trying to find out where he is. Once you walk around, Westa

will come upstairs. Westa will ask if Claude liked the dinner, and 

Claude says that he enjoyed it. Westa calls Claude the hero, and 

Claude wonders what she is talking about. Westa doesn't say a word, 

and then runs downstairs, sweating. You hear that Weata is upset 

because she accidently referred to the hero in front of Claude. You 

wonder what is going on around the village. The elder of the town, 

Regis, introduces himself, and thanks Claude for saving Rena in the 

forest. Regis asks Claude where he is going from Arlia, and Claude 

says that he is uncertain. Regis suggests that Claude is a hero, and 

not actually a traveler, and Claude is very surprised. Regis thinks 

that Claude is the hero since he had foreign clothes and the "Sword 

of Light". Claude insists that he's not a hero of any kind, and Regis 

tells Claude about the "Sorcery Globe", a large orb that hit down on 

the northeastern continent. Regis believed that Claude was the "hero" 

because of the timing of this disaster, the people believe that a 

hero will emerge in strange clothing a a "Sword of Light". Regis then 

says that if Claude insists it strongly, that he actually isn't the 

hero. Claude says that he didn't come here on his own will, and then 

Claude apologizes for not being the "hero" of the people. Rena then 

leaves, disappointed. Regis tells Claude to leave Rena alone for a 

bit. Regis tells Claude to not use the "Sword of Light", because the 

people of the world will be uneasy about it. Claude agrees, and puts 

the "Sword of Light" (the Phase Gun) away. Regis says that you can 

stay at his home for awhile, so go to Regis' home (the one of the far 

right), and stay the night.



When Claude wakes up, Regis says that you should go to Salva to get 

more information, and then gives you a Longsword. Go the Shingo 

Forest, and Rena will be in her hiding place. Rena apologizes for 

all of the trouble that Claude has been in, and Claude apologizes 

for not being the actual hero. Rena then tells Claude to leave her 

alone for awhile. As you leave, there will be a boy by the gate 

that will warn you that if you stray from the road on the way to 

Salva, you will be attacked by monsters. I recommend getting used 

to fighting outside, though, so just equip your Longsword and go 

out and fight a few enemies. Once you feel strong enough, head to 

Salva.



Salva

*Items in Salva:

Heavy Ring, Rena's Hairpin, Portrait B


*Pickpocket Data: 

Spectacles, Pet Food, Resurrect Bottle x 2, Dummy Doll, Gold Idol,

24 Fol, Triple overfermented sake, Liquor Bottle, Gold, Ruby, 

Magical Clay, 5 Fol, 12 Fol, Apple Jam, Mental Pot, Iron Greave, 

Silver Idol, 500 Fol, Blurry Photo, Wine, Artemis Leaf, Silver, 

Trikabut, Resurrect Bottle, Falsified Account book, Paralyze 

Check x 2, Idaten Ship, Crystal, Orgol



*Village Information:

Salva is a mining town that digs for rare ores to sell. The mine is 

closed because of the reoccuring earthquakes. The mayor of the town, 

Burns, is the chief excavator. Burns is on a journey currently, so 

his son Alen is in charge for the time being. People come to trade 

various items in Salva. People note that Alen hasn't been acting 

very normal lately.



Walk around town, and talk to everyone. Go into the weapon and armor 

shops to buy Claude some new equippment, as he'll need it for the 

coming dungeon. If you leave Alen's house, Claude will complain

about not being able to get back to the Calnas. Now, head back to 

Arlia.



Right when you return to Arlia, Westa, Regis, and the town's priest 

are very worried, because Alen came to town and abducted Rena. 

Regis explains how Alen brought soldiers in and made Rena go along 

with them back to Salva. Claude wonders why the village people 

aren't doing anything to help Rena, and they say that they wouldn't 

risk putting Arlia in a counter-attack situation. Claude then offers 

to go and help Rena. Westa thanks Claude, and Regis says that he'll 

be alright since he has the "Sword of Light".


Go back into Salva. Everyone in town is talking about how Alen is 

going insane, and how he abducted Rena. Go to Alen's house, and 

the door will be locked. Claude will blast the door with the "Sword 

of Light", and then you can go inside the home. Indoors, Rena isn't 

anywhere to be found. Enter the door to the right on the first floor 

to find Rena's hairpin. Go to the statue in the room in the corner 

to find a secret passage. You will find a wounded man within the 

passage. The man says that Alen took Rena down into the mine to go 

to a strange alter, and tells you to find her. Go into the mine.


Salva Mine

*Items in Salva Mine:

Rose Hips, Blackberry x 2, Iron, Gold x 2, Spectacles, Blueberry



*Enemy Info:

Funnythief, Kobold, Lizardaxe, Vopatbunny



It is advisable that you are at least level 4 when entering the 

Salva mine. This is the first dungeon in the game, but it isn't a 

long one. Walk around for awhile to get used to the enemies here, 

and to gain a few levels. None of the enemies are very tough here, 

just use Kuhazan if you have to attack from far away. Otherwise, 

just use normal attacks the entire time.



Travel through the mine until you get to the alter in which Rena has 

been tied town. Alen will tell Claude to back off, and Claude tells 

Alen to leave Rena go. Alen plans to marry Rena in the mine, and 

Rena begs Claude to help her. Claude frees Rena from the altar. Now, 

Alen creates a shockwave that knocks Rena and Claude back. Alen 

transforms into a hideous monster, and you must fight him.



Boss: Alen-Tax

HP: 400

Strength: Darkness 

Weakness: Light


Alen is a very easy boss, just because his HP are so low. If you 

use three Kuhazan attacks in a row on him and they connect, he will 

be gone. Don't use Rena to attack him, as she has less of a defense 

power than Claude. If you don't have enough MP to use the three 

Kuhazans, just run up to him and attack him. You might lose some HP, 

but Rena will be there to heal you.


Once you have defeated Alen, Claude asks if Rena was hurt, and she 

says that she is fine. Rena says she has no idea why Alen is acting 

this way, as Alen seemed obsessed about something. Claude wonders 

how a human can take such a hideous form. Rena casts a heal spell on 

Alen, and he wakes up, not knowing where he is. Alen is totally 

oblivious to what just happened. Claude, Rena, and Alen all return 

to Salva. Claude and Rena tell Alen what he did, and Alen is very 

sorry about everything. Alen says that when he saw the stone, it 

gave him a rushing feeling. Claude and Rena then return to Arlia.



Regis thanks Claude once again for saving Rena, and wonders what 

happened to Alen. Claude explains the whole story about how Alen 

was changed because of the rock. They talk about how the rock is 

much like the Sorcery Globe in that it turns people into monsters. 

Claude apologizes for using the Phase Gun again on the door, but he 

says it was neccesary to save Rena. Regis asks Claude if he will go 

and investigate the Sorcery Globe. Regis thinks that Claude would 

be the best one to investigate it since it might help him find a way 

back home. Claude agrees to help Regis, and Rena asks if Claude will 

take her. Regis thinks it would be a good idea if Claude would take 

Rena because of her special healing powers. Claude says that he will 

take Rena only if Westa allows him to.


Go back into the house, and Regis will ask to talk to you before you 

go to bed. Regis tells Claude that he was expecting for Rena to go

along with you, and Regis notes how Rena has special healing powers 

that no one else does. Regis tells Claude that Rena was found when 

she was very young, abandoned, and Westa took care of her. Regis says 

that no one has told Rena about this yet. Regis also notes that Rena 

was wearing a special pendant when she was found. Regis then tells 

you that you may go to sleep. As Claude is sleeping, he hears a knock 

on the window. If you go out onto the balcany, Rena will be there. 

Rena says she wants to talk to you. Go outside the house.



Rena says that her mother was very surprised when hearing that she 

wanted to go along with Claude. Rena says that Regis came in before 

Westa could answer Rena, and Regis said that it would be a good idea. 

Rena also says that she wishes to find her real mother in the world, 

and has a new quest to undertake. Rena tells Claude about how she 

was found, and then you get to see a flashback to when Rena's father 

died. Rena wonders why she had a pendant when she was found, and then 

says that she thought her mother was caring for her when she was given 

it. Rena says that Westa has done a great job of taking care of Rena, 

but Rena would like to find her real mother. Also, Rena would like to 

know why she has special healing magic. 



Before leaving the next day, Regis says that Claude and Rena should go 

to Cross Castle to meet the king so that they can get permission to go 

to Ell and locate the Sorcery Globe. Leave town and go north. Once you 

get to Salva, talk to Alen, and you will tell him that you are going 

to be investigating the Sorcery Globe. If you talk to him again, he 

will give you a Happiness Ring. Get any equippment you haven't gotten 

yet, and head north.

@node CC-2 "TREASURE HUNT"





                  --Chapter 2: The Treasure Hunt--





You are now on the main part of the Cross continent. You can now travel 

to all of the villages on the continent, but the main destination will 

be Cross Castle. If you'd like to purchase equippment from the other 

villages, though, that is also a good idea. Your next destination is 

Cross Castle. It's a huge castle that is slightly north of Salva. Head 

there.



Cross Castle

*Items in Cross Castle:

Wooden Shield, Leather Helm, 500 Fol

*Village Information:

Cross is the center for most major trade and government on the Cross 

continent. It is a huge, bustling castle/town that has many shops, 

people, and a friendly kingdom.



*Note: In order to get Opera/Ernest to join the party, you must have seen 

the special Private Action here. To see it, just execute a single Private 

Action, and walk north, toward the castle. When you are in front of Cross 

Castle, a man with three eyes runs into you. He excuses himself, then runs 

off again. This is all you need to do, although you will need to do other 

things later.



You will want to buy the new weapons and armor here, but you will be 

getting some money from the king, so don't worry if you don't have 

enough money at the moment. Head to the castle, north of the village 

part of Cross.



When you get into the castle, Rena will register your names at the 

front counter so you can have an audience with the king. The girls at 

the front counter tell you that you will have to wait your turn, so 

you can go around to the different places in Cross Castle for the time 

being. Now, go around through the castle. There are three chests here, 

including 500 Fol, which you will need to buy some good armor later. 

After you've walked around through the wings of the castle, go back to 

the first level of the castle, and head north. The guards will now let 

you through to talk to the king.



When you talk to the king, the king will greet Rena. You will be able 

to ask him a few questions. Once you have asked the king all three 

questions, he will give you 600 Fol and a Passport to get to the El 

continent. He tells you that you should investigate the Sorcery Globe 

as soon as possible. Now, head out of the castle. 



When you get back to to the village area, you will see a fight going 

on in town square. Claude and Rena stop to watch. You will see that 

two magicians are having a fight over a map that the female magician 

apparently had. The male magician threatens the female magician, and 

Claude runs up to try to settle the fight. The male magician becomes 

angry, and starts to cast a spell. The female magician quickly casts 

a fire spell, and the male magician runs away, telling her that she 

will regret it. Claude now goes toward the female magician. Claude 

stops to see if the female magician is alright. She thanks Claude for 

helping her. She tells you that she got the map to look for a secret 

treasure in Cross Cave, and she wants Claude and Rena will go along. 

You have to go on this mission, so choose the first option. She now 

introduces herself as @{" Celine " LINK "extras/Celine.ilbm/MAIN"} Jules, and joins your party.



Now is a good time to buy new weapons and armor for your characters 

in the stores west of the village area. There is also a skill shop 

here, and you'll also eventually want to buy all of the first sets 

of skills. Make sure you have everything you need, and head to Cross 

Cave, it's a mountain with a cave opening. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Cross Cave

*Items in Cross Cave:

Blackberry x 2, Iron, Cure Poison x 2, Lavender x 2, ?Mineral (Rock), 

Magic Canvas, Tri-ball, Artemis Leaf, Sweet Syrup x 2, 700 Fol, ?Item 

(Aquaberry), ?Jewlrey (Reverse Doll), Green Beryl, Heart Barriers, 

Ancient Writings, Resurrect Mist, Feather Pen



*Enemy Info:

Alraune, Armedknight, Landworm, Slime


The enemies in Cross Cave not very tough at all. Most of them can be 

taken out fast with just a few normal attacks from Claude. You really 

shouldn't need to gain many levels here, but if you're feeling weak, 

go ahead. The area has many useful treasures and is pretty large, and 

is kind of like a small maze. 



When you get to the northeast area of the maze, you will find a dead 

end. Your party wonders what you should do. Claude points out that 

the map says to cast a certain spell. Celine casts the spell at once, 

and part of the cave opens up. Your characters say to move on. Save 

at the save point, and continue on. In the next room, there are five 

treasures. Grab all of the treasures. Make sure you say the treasure 

to the north for last, though, since opening that will make you fight 

the boss. Once you have all of the other treasures, save on the save 

point in the previous room again, and open it. You don't even have to 

fight this boss, really, but it's useful for experience and Fol.



Boss: Gargoyle (2)

HP: 1,500 (each)

Strength: Darkness

Weakness: Light


The Gargoyles shouldn't be too hard. Just keep using Claude's normal 

attacks. If you need to, use the Shooting Stars Killer Move if you 

want to attack from a range. This will also give Rena time to heal

Claude if he needs it. Celine can use Ray here, which also does a 

large amount of damage to them. Just keep pounding away on them one 

at a time with Claude, and they should be gone.


After you win, you will be able to leave Cross Cave. When you are at 

the exit, the party will split up. Celine thanks Claude and Rena for 

helping her so much, and Claude tells her that it was no problem at 

all. Claude suddenly asks Celine if she will join Rena and he. The 

characters are surprised, and Celine says she'll think about it. Now, 

Celine tells you that she will come along with you if Rena says it is 

alright with her. You now can pick from two options:

@{FG fill}1) Come with us, Celine!

2) It isn't a good idea after all@{FG text}

This is basically your choice to keep Celine throughout the rest of 

the game. I strongly suggest taking Celine, since she is a strong

spell-caster, and unless you plan on having both Opera and Ernest 

join the party, you won't even be able to fill your party to the full 

eight members. I highly suggest you pick option 1.



Your next destination is Clik, a port town on the north edge of the 

continent. You will have to go over a bridge to get there, and it is 

a fairly long walk from Cross Cave.

@{"NEXT CHAPTER" link CC-3}

@ENDNODE

@NODE CC-3 "THE FATE OF CLIK"





                   --Chapter 3: The Fate of Clik--

Clik


*Items in Clik:

Lyre, Vegetables, Grain, Seafood



*Pickpocket Data:

800 Fol, 500 Fol, Breeze Earrings, Today's Menu, Flash Pot, Aquaberry, 

Graneshezo, Artemis Leaf, 100 Fol, Dummy Doll, Gatagata Knuckle, Beer,  

Wrecked Knuckle, Yasai, Hotcake, Extend Card, Discovery Card, Feat 

Symbol, Kokuryu "Ishidaya", Herbal Oil, 50 Fol, Senchuyasaku, Berserk 

Ring, Apple Crepe, Silver Cross, Ruby, Orange Sherbet, Silver Charm, 

Batlayer Ring, Egg Sandwich, 500 Fol, Weird Clothing, Robe, Magical 

Clay, Mandrake, Sapphire, Anklet, Iron, Fountain Pen



By the pickpocket data, it is obvious that there are very many awesome 

items you can steal from people in Clik. You normally won't have the 

41,800 Fol you need to buy the Bandit's Glove, nor the special Pickpocket 

Specialty at this point, so you will probably pass these things up. If 

you do build your money up to 41,800, and get the glove, you can even 

steal from Philia in the Private Action, which gives you a certain item 

in which you can three random items. This can be extremely useful, so if 

you are a completist, go for it. :)



Head to the captain of the ship. He will say that you that you will need 

a special Passport to leave on the ship with the crew. Claude shows him 

the Passport, and he is very surprised. Claude tells him how he got it 

from the king of Cross himself. The captain tells you that you can ride 

with them to Lacour continent, but they are packing at the moment, so it 

will be delayed a bit. He tells Claude to look around in the village for 

awhile for the time being. 



Go into the main square of the village. Claude says that he wants to sit 

down on one of the benches there. When your party starts to walk toward 

the bench, a boy runs past quickly, knocking you down. The party is now  

fairly angry for being knocked down. Claude notices that his wallet is 

gone! Your party must now find his wallet. The party members now describe 

him as being a small boy with blue hair. You will now have to look for 

the him to get your money back.


Talk to the villagers, specifically the kids playing near the docks. One 

of them tells you that he is near the bar. Go to the bar, in the first 

part of town (the part you entered from). You will find the boy, face to 

the wall. Claude stops him, but lets him go to talk. He says he is a rich 

boy, and he only stole your money so that the other children would think 

he was cool, and so he could surprise everyone. Claude is slightly mad, 

but he will forgive him. The boy now gives back your wallet. Claude says 

that he will let the boy go if he shows them around town, so the boy now 

agrees. The boy introduces himself as Ketil, and he joins the party (he 

cannot fight, of course). 



There are about five things you can do in town while you have Ketil in 

your party:

-After feeling a small earthquake, Ketil will ask you if you know about 

the fountain in the square. You can say yes or say that you don't. Ketil 

will tell you about the stores in the square if you tell him you don't 

know about it.


-Go into Ketil's house, and he will try to sneak up on a servant. Ketil's 

mother now comes in. His mother suspects that you are trying to kidnap 

Ketil, but his mother soon leaves.


-Go into the resturant. The cook gives you a food sample for free. All 

three are unique Japanese dishes.


-Go to either the ice cream shop or the crepe shop. You can now buy Ketil 

either a vanilla ice cream from the ice cream shop, or a banana crepe at 

the crepe shop.


-Go to the clothing store. Ketil will get various clothes, and ask one of 

your characters to try them on. You now get to pick which character you 

want to wear the clothing (you can pick from Claude, Rena, or Celine). No 

matter which character you choose, the other characters will laugh at that 

character, but then apologize.


Once you are done, go to the other children at the docks. Claude, Rena, 

and Celine get Ketil to play with the other children. The other children 

will now accept Ketil as a friend, and play with him. Now, you can go to 

the boat. Head to the captain.


The captain will tell you that they still have some last-minute packing to 

do, so he tells you to gather your items that you need. Now, walk into town 

square. A huge earthquake will occur, and you get to watch an awesome scene 

showing Clik's destruction! You end up on a hill, with the survivors. The 

captain tells you that he can't do anything since he doesn't have a boat, 

and gives your Passport back. Now, go north a little. You see what was left 

of Clik being washed away by a title wave (this town isn't very lucky). Go 

head north, and you will find Ketil. Ketil will tell you that he found one 

of his friends, but couldn't find the other. He will also say he doesn't 

know where his mother his, but he knows she will be alright. The next real 

destination is Mars, a town to the east, but not as far east as Herlie. 

@{"NEXT CHAPTER" link CC-4}

@ENDNODE
@NODE CC-4 "ABDUCTED"




                  --Chapter 4: Abduction at Mars-- 


Mars


*Items in Mars:

Sour Syrup, Purple Mist, Silense Card, Silk Robe



*Pickpocket Data:

Robe, 120 Fol, 200 Fol, Ring of Sorrow, Boots, Fairy Glass, Ruby Wand, 

Magic Rock, Kokumotsu, Silence Card, Rotten Milk, Legendary Box, Rose 

Hips, Wine, Angel Statue, Silk Robe, Herbal Oil, Magical Hat



Right when you get into the village, head to the house directly to the 

northeast. Celine's mother, Labe, notices her, and tells her to sit down 

and listen to the incident the elder is talking about. If Celine is not 

in your party, Celine will already be sitting down here. The elder tells 

everyone at the table about what happened. The night before, all of the 

village's children were found to be missing. The elder tells you that a 

messanger came to tell the people of Mars that some bandits had kidnapped 

the village's children, and are holding them for a ransom of 50,000 Fol 

and one of the village's sacred books, "Book of Secret Seals". Celine's 

father, Egras, tells you that that the forest was surrounded by a magical 

barrier, so if the bandits broke through the barrier, they must be quite 

strong. The party asks what the elders are going to do about it. They say 

that they hired a swordsman, Dias, to help save the children, because he 

is training for a special tournament in Lacour (the Lacour Tournament). 

The party then tries to persuade the elder to let them help handle this 

situation. Dias now gets made because he was offered to finish the job 

first. Dias leaves the room, hurling an insult at Celine. Celine now gets 

very mad at Dias, saying how he is very rude. 



Now, you will see Claude and Celine standing outside of the house, waiting 

for Rena. Claude tells Celine that he admires Dias' strength, but he thinks 

that he and Celine should go on without him. Claude suggests that they get 

to finishing the job before Dias can. Rena will now come back. Rena urges 

to let Dias join the party. Claude tells Rena that Dias is bent on doing 

things himself, so he doesn't want to let him join. Rena gets rather angry 

at Claude, saying "Claude may not need Dias, but I need Dias." Rena asks 

why Claude would say such a thing, and Claude tells her how he isn't about 

to let Dias join. Rena gets mad, and then leaves to join Dias. Celine tells 

you to get the equipment you need, and then head back to the elder's house. 



Go to the weapon/armor shop to the south. There are many new and powerful 

weapons and armor here, but you probably won't be able to afford it all. 

Get everything you can that increases defense and offense, but don't get a 

Flame Sword for Claude (because you can find one in the forest). Also, buy 

as many Blueberries as you can. You won't have a healer, as you only get 

Claude and Celine, so your HP will probably run down pretty fast. 



Go back to the elder's house to get some rest. In the morning, the village 

elders wish Claude/Celine off. Celine tells Claude that they will do their 

best to protect the village. Claude is thinking about something, and then 

realizes that Celine is trying to talk to him. Egras thinks that the group 

thing is foolish, saying that you all should have gone together. Egras says 

to remember that it isn't a competition, it is for the sake of the children. 

Egras tells you to help Rena and Dias if they get in trouble. Celine asks 

Claude if he was thinking about what Rena said, but Claude remains silent 

and enters the forest. You will now be in the Heraldry Forest.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Heraldry Forest

*Items in Heraldry Forest:

?Herb (Rose Hips), Amber Robe, Smelling Salts, Dummy Doll, Flame Sword, 

Mandrake


The Hardldry Forest is one of the hardest areas in Claude's scenario. The 

enemies here are very difficult, and since you don't have a healer, you 

will have to rely on your healing items only. Most of the random battles 

are not too hard, but some of the mages here will cast multiple Starlight 

spells, doing quite a lot of damage to both Claude and Celine. You will 

also run into several groups of bandits in the forest, each of which have 

500 HP. These bandits are very hard because they will often get their hits 

in before you have a chance to hit them, and sometimes multiple hits. 



When you get the the third group of bandits, they will be extremely angry 

at the party for coming this far. You will learn that Dias and Rena have 

made it through while fighting bandits at this point. 



When you make it through to the second save point in the forest, save and 

heal. Eventually, the Master of Heraldry comes. He says that since he has 

been helping the people of Mars, he has came here to help you. Claude now 

says that Dias and Rena probably beat them to finding the children. Rena

asks Master of Heraldry how the bandits are, and he says "they're doing 

fine". Rena asks him what he means, and he reveals himself as Vermillion, 

the boss of the bandits, and tells Celine that he has killed her father. 

You must now fight Vermillion.


Boss: Vermillion

HP: 3,000

Strength: Darkness

Weakness: Fire, Light

Vermillion won't be very much of a problem if you're level 15 or so. Have 

Celine cast Ray continuously on Vermillion, and have Claude fight up close 

with his Killer Moves or normal attacks. If you have enough MP, you can 

probably even keep unleashing Air Slash Killer Moves until he dies. If you 

have the Flame Sword, it won't take many hits to kill him.



When you beat Vermillion, Celine tells you that you should go to help the 

children. Claude tells Celine that they should go back to the village first 

to see if everyone there is doing fine. Rena and Dias will now enter. They 

explain that they fought through the forest, and found the children in a 

cabin at the end of the forest. Dias sees Vermillion on the ground, dead, 

and asks Claude if he killed it. Claude says that he did, and Dias says to 

Claude, "I guess what Rena said was really true." Claude wonders what he 

means, and Dias tells Claude that he must be a good swordsman. Dias says 

that he sees that he and Claude will fight in the future. Dias now leaves. 

You must now go back to the village.


You are now in Celine's house. Claude asks if Egras is alright, and the 

elder tells him that Rena's healing magic will probably help him, and it 

looks like he will pull through. The elder is very surprised that Rena has 

such strong healing magic. Rena now tells Claude that it was amazing how 

he beat Vermillion by himself. Claude tells Rena that it wasn't just him, 

he had great help from Celine. Rena then tells Claude that it must have 

been a lot of work for Claude, then, because Dias praised him sword skills. 

Claude says that it isn't surprising that Rena likes Dias. Rena tells him 

not to get the wrong idea, and that Dias is like a brother to her. Claude 

then tells Rena that he hopes she finds her real mother.


In Celine's house, in the back room, Egras is lying down. He thanks Rena 

for using the healing magic on him. You now mention that you are headed 

to Herlie so you can get to El continent. Claude then asks Egras about 

the Sorcery Globe, and Egras thinks that the Sorcery Globe is causing the 

animals of the world to turn into monsters. Egras tells you to get more 

information first, though. 


Later, Claude will be alone with Egras in his bedroom. Egras tells Claude 

that he thinks Claude is actually the hero, even though Claude denies it. 

Claude explains how Celine and Rena are also helping to fight. Egras will

now leave. 



In the morning, Claude will ask Egras where you should go first on the 

continent of El. Egras tells Claude that they should visit Lacour Castle, 

and the village of Linga to get their Ancient Writings translated, since 

Linga is known for its excellent scholars. He tells you to make a first 

stop at Lacour Castle, though. Your next destination is Herlie, to the 

east. It's the port town.

@NODE CC-5 "Getting Ashton"




                         --Chapter 5: Ashton--


@{" Ashton's Mug Shot " LINK "extras/ashton.ilbm/MAIN"}

This chapter is totally optional. If you want Opera to join your party, 

or if you don't want Ashton to join your party (you can't have both Opera 

and Ashton in the same party), head to the ship going to Lacour by boat, 

and skip this chapter. If you want Ashton in the party, read on. 


When you first enter into Hilton, talk to the two men near the entrance. 

They will tell you that a two-headed dragon has appeared in the Salva 

Mines. Rena comments about Alen, and Celine asks who he is. Claude will 

ask the people for details, the men say that several warriors have gone 

to try to defeat the dragon. They will tell you to stay away from Salva 

Mine because it is dangerous. Head back to Salva Mine. ^_^



In the mine, a soldier will tell you that the mine is off limits because 

of the danger. Claude boasts his strength, and the soldier eventually 

lets you enter. The soldier tells you that another warrior just went in, 

and not to get in his way. Rena wonders if that warrior is Dias.



Go into the new section of the mine that you couldn't go into earlier. 

It's to the west of a sign on the west side of the mine. The monsters 

here are much tougher, so make sure to be at full HP/MP.



Salva Mine

*Items in the new area of Salva Mine:

Maple Syrup, Brigandy, Iron, Aquaberry, Gold Pierce, Cinderella Glass, 

Diamond, Star Ruby


Go farther into the mine and collect the treasures. You will eventually 

see a warrior in a blue robe walking around. Claude asks who that man 

is and Rena says that it must be the warrior that entered before them. 

Follow the man. Keep going the way that the warrior has gone through the 

mines, and you will see him fighting with the dragon. Claude tells you 

that the passage is way too small that everyone can fit in. Your party 

members basically just cheer the warrior on. ^_^ The man turns around 

and asks you to be quiet. While the warrior has his back turned, the 

dragon sneaks up on the man, and graf its two heads on the man's back! 

Ashton looks around, wondering what happened. The party tells him that 

the dragons are on his back! The warrior gets mad, and blames you for 

distracting him while he was fighting. He forces the blame on you. Rena 

wonders what you can do to help him. The warrior tells you to search 

with him for a way to get the dragons off. You then get a choice:



1) Take responsiblity

2) Don't take responsibility



If you take option 1, the man is very surprised, and thanks the party 

for understand him. The warrior introduces himself as Ashton Anchors, 

and joins your party.



If you take option 2, Rena says that it isn't your fault, since it was 

him who turned around to you. Ashton is angry, and asks the party if 

they really think it was his fault. Claude says that it probably was. 

The dragons will start fighting, and Claude tells the party to go run 

away from here. You can now leave the mine. If you go back to the man, 

though, you can still get him to join the party, and he introduces 

himself as Ashton Anchors.



Now, leave the town. Claude asks Ashton if he knows of any way to free 

the dragons. Now, the dragons begin to start talking. Rena stards to 

like the dragons. Rena asks if she can name the dragons. Rena names the 

dragons the blue one Ururun, and the red one Gyroro. Ashton now wonders 

what to do. Rena thinks that you may be able to find some information 

in a book. Rena says that there's many books at the elder's house in 

Mars. 

@{"NEXT CHAPTER" link CC-6}

@endnode
@node CC-6 "Subquesting with Ashton"


                  --Chapter 6: Ashton's Subquest--


This is where the actual optional part comes in. You can either go right 

to Lacour or continue the quest in trying to remove the dragons from the 

back of Ashton. This area is completely optional, but there are great 

items to be found, and a good place to gain some levels. I strongly urge 

you to do the subquest. If you want to go on the subquest, go to Mars. 

If you don't, then skip the rest of this chapter.



When you go into the elder's house, you will find numerous books on the 

shelves. You want to look at the "Book of Detachment". Claude reads it, 

and the book says that you you need to have a "tear of the flying lord" 

in the "holy silver goblet" to detach the dragons. Crawd reads on, and 

he finds out that the silver goblet sleeps near the water in an ocean. 

Claude says that this could be referring to Coll Lake at the northwest 

end of Cross continent. Rena also suggests that the area inside in the 

ocean could be the Mountain Palace near the lake. Claude reads on, and 

realizes that to get the "tear of the flying lord", you must climb the 

neccessary mountain and face a large monster. Claude suggests that the 

book may be referring to the bird that lives on the top of that mountain. 

Celine says that a demo lives on top of Lasgus mountain, to the west of 

Cross Castle (I don't know what happens if Celine isn't in your party). 

Claude says that the book states that once you have the tear, you have 

to recite the lines listed in the book. Ashton is very happy because he 

now knows how to get the dragons off. Claude says that once the dragons 

have been taken off, though, that they will be destroyed forever. Celine 

says that they should go as far to killing Ururun and Gyoro. Claude and 

Rena will agree, and Ashton starts to feel sorry for the dragons. Claude 

suggests to go to the Mountain Palace.



Go south of where Clik was, on the opposite side of the river. Climb to 

the very top of the mountain. When you get to the Mountain Palace, there 

is a guard standing who won't let anyone without permission of the king 

enter. 



Return to Cross Castle. Go to the castle, and talk to the king. You will 

explain the situation you've gotten into, and the king will eventually 

give you permission to enter, and 3000 Fol. Go to the Mountain Palace now 

and you will be able to enter.



Mountain Palace

*Items in the Mountain Palace:

Lunar Tablet, Crystal, ?Herb (Artemis Leaf), Resurrection Bottle, ?Jewelry 

(Shiny Earring), Cure Stone, Sweet Syrup, Crest Rod, Amber Robe, ?Mineral 

(Damascus), Trikabut, Fairy Toilette, Damascus, Emerald Ring, Fairy Statue, 

Cestus, ?Mineral (Orihalcum)



*Enemy Info:

Archer, Hood, Hounddog, Petragerell, Punnythief, Sandglass, Slimepool



The enemies here are pretty tough. It's a very good area in the game to 

build levels, though, since there is a guard that will refill your MP and 

HP if you talk to him like an inn. This is the first large area you will 

have Ashton in, too, so it is wise to gain some levels for him. Here are 

a few of the enemies here:



*Slimepools: Use Claude's "Shotting Star" Killer Move at close range, since 

  they can't move very fast. The Slimepools are especially dangerous since 

  they paralyze your characters often, and you probably won't have the needed 

  remedy items like Liquor Bottles or Cure Potions at this point. 

*Archers: Use Claude's normal attack on them quickly. The Archers are really 

  dangerous since they shoot a barrage of arrows, and can pick off the spell 

  casters (Rena and Celine).

*Sandglass: Shouldn't be too hard, use two normal attacks and they should be 

  gone. Once you hit them, they become engraged, and use a powerful normal 

  attack that does a lot of damage even if you have good armor.



Keep going through the dungeon until you find the Silver Cup. Ashton starts 

to get very happy, but Ururun and Gyoro are very sad. The rest of the party 

gets mad at Ashton because he said that in front of the dragons. :) Once 

this scene is over, an enemy drops down, and you must fight it.



Boss: Nightmare 

HP: 9,000

No strengths/weaknesses


Nightmare is a pretty hard boss. She's fast and powerful, and Tetanus Wind is 

a very powerful spell. Keep nailing Nightmare with a barrage of the best close 

up Killer Moves you have. Ashton's Leaf Slash and Claude's Shooting Star Killer 

Moves will work well here. Leaf Slash is incredibly effective because Ashton 

can execute it quick, and before Nightmare can cast Tetanus Wind. Keep using 

the best Killer Moves you have, and healing with Rena. You shouldn't have too 

many problems unless you are at low levels.



After you win, the party stops. Clude asks the dragons if they hold a grudge 

against the party for trying to find a way to get them off of Ashton's back. 

Ashton says that the dragons are in an awkward position. When you leave, the 

party wonders who the "lord of the air" could be. The party says that you 

should check Lasgus Mountain, west of Cross. Go there.



Lasgus Mountain 

*Enemy Info: Pylesherry, Shout



is a very short dungeon. The battles here are very hard, and you probably 

won't have Ashton at very high levels yet. The Pylesherry enemies cast 

Blood Suck, so you'll want to rush up to attack them at the very beginning 

of the fights. The Shouts will drain your MP very fast, but can't hurt you. 

They're a very annoying enemy in these respects. Try to avoid battles with 

them. Head up the mountain, it won't take very long to get to the top.



At the top of the mountain, you will find a huge nest. Nothing at all is 

here though. Ashton says that the "tear of the lord" should be here. Now, 

a huge demonic bird falls down near the party. Ashton apparently knows the 

monster. The party realizes that Ashton is not speaking, but the dragons 

are. Jin says that the dragons aren't powerful when attached to Ashton. 

Ashton (the dragons) then challenge Jin to a fight. You will now have to 

fight Jin.



Boss: Jin

HP 20,000

Strength: Fire, Wind



Jin is one of the toughest bosses in the game. Don't fight Jin unless you 

are at least at level 26 or so. Jin is very large and fast, and can fly 

across the screen at very high speeds. Jin also casts Master Attack, which 

is a powerful attack spell that will almost kill one character. If you see 

Jin gathering power, run up and attack him quickly, because that is the 

sign that he's going to use "Master Attack". Jin also casts Light Cross, 

which will do a decent amount of damage to the party. "Head Splitter" is a 

great Hissatsuwaza to use. Celine should continuously cast Energy Arrow on 

Jin. Before Celine does attack magic, though, make sure Celine casts the 

spell of "Reflection" on every character, as this will raise your defensive 

powerful to a higher amount. This battle will likely take a long time to 

complete, so keep using your Blackberries on Celine and Rena if neccessary. 



After you defeat Jin, Jin bashes Ururun and Gyroro for attaching to Ashton. 

Ururun and Gyoro say that they were individual before, but now they know 

what it's like to have a good friend. You received the Demon-Bird Tear. 

Ashton is now himself (as opposed to being dragons ^_^). The party says 

that Jin must have really been jealous of the dragons. Ashton is really 

confused about what happened, and Rena asks if Ashton really wants to get 

rid of the dragons. He will eventually say "yes", but he is hesitant. You 

say to return to Salva and the mine there, since you must return to the 

place where the dragons originated to detach them.



Now, go to the first area that Ashton joined you. You say that all Ashton 

will need to do is chant the words in the book. Ashton starts to say the 

words, but the dragons start becoming sad. Ashton continues until the last 

line of the chant, but then he stops. Ashton says that he can't remove the 

dragons, since they have become a part of him. The dragons become happy 

again. Rena says that Ashton should join the part for good, so Ashton will 

join the group.

Now, head to Herlie.

showing up for the competition.







Go shopping for the weapons and armor you need. The shops here have many 



new items and minerals. You will likely have a lot of money here, so feel 



free to spend away. When you're ready, go to the in. During the night, 



Claude wakes up, and goes outside. Rena secretly follows him. Claude tries 



to use his communicator again, but it is just static. Now, Claude looks up 



into the sky, and wonders if one of the stars there is Earth. Rena hides, 



and Claude walks back to the room. Rena then follows.







Do whatever shopping you need, and walk to Lacour Castle. It is a very 



large castle area, even bigger than Cross Castle was.

*Village Information:



Everyone is very excited about the upcoming Lacour Tournament, which is 



to be held shortly. Many people talk about how people fighting must select 



a sponsor and enter fights according to the weapons and armor that the 



sponser offers. The weapon and armor shops here will not sell you things 



because they will only show their wares during the tournament to the  



fighting in the Tournament. Others hint atthe game's features like Item 



Creation and Specialties. Some hint about a young boy who is helping to 



develop a secret weapon.







When you first enter the castle, go to the castle area, and speak to the 



woman at the bottom of the counter. Rena asks about seeing the king, but 



the women say that audiences won't be accepted because the king has been 



boggled down with the tournament. Claude eventually asks Rena what she 



would think if he entered the tournament. Claude says that he heard that 



Dias would be fighting in this tournament, and he wants to see how strong 



he really is. Rena is somewhat shocked, but eventually agrees. The woman 



at the bottom of the front castle area (the receptionist) will sign you 



up for the tournament. The recpeptionist now tells Claude to find one of 



the weapon/armor sponsors before the tournament. It is a few days before 



the actual tournament now. Now, you will have to choose one of the four 



sponsors to fight with in the tournament. If you win, you get all of that 



sponsor's items, and some reward money, and you'll be able to meet with 



the king. 







The sponsors are as follows:







*Counterpunch:



Equipment: Sinclair Sabre, Brigandine, Buckler, Plate Helm, Silver Greaves



Items: Sweet Syrup, Mixed Syrup, Blackberry



-Attack: 100



-Defense: 99



-Evade: 30







*Knockout:



Equipment: Long Edge, Leather Armor, Wooden Shield, Leather Helm, Leather 



  Greaves



Items: Sweet Syrup, Mixed Syrup, Blackberry



-Attack: 285



-Defense: 16



-Evade: 50







*Straight:



Equipment: Gusguine, Banded Mail, Knight Shield, Banded Helm, Plate Greaves



Items: Sweet Syrup, Mixed Syrup, Blackberry



-Attack: 250 



-Defense: 46 



-Evade: 60







Slayer:



Equipment: Waloon Sword, Ring Mail, Round Shield, Iron Helm, Iron Greaves



Items: Fruit Syrup, Fresh Syrup, Attack Bottle, Violent Pill



-Attack: 240 



-Defense: 59 



-Evade: 60











Keep in mind that if you make it to the championship match in the actual 



tournament, you will get to keep all of the items your sponsor provided 



you with. I recommend the "Knockout" sponsor highly. If you sign up with 



Knockout, you get the Long Edge, the best sword for a long time. Although 



the armor you get is fairly crappy, you will probably still be at least 



fairly powerful defensively anyway. "Slayer" is the most well-rounded of 



the sponsors, but the Waloon Sword isn't even much better the the current 



sword you have, and your prize after the battle won't be very good. Sign 



up with a sponsor.







The sponsor you signed up with confirms your sponsorship. Now, leave and 



go to the main part of the town, and the party will split up. The party 



says that you should just enjoy the town until the time of the fight. Go 



outside if you want to gain any levels. When you're ready for the actual 



tournament, go to the inn. 







Inside of the inn, you can decide whether to wait awhile or get ready for 



the tournament immediately. If you decide to go straight through with the 



tournament you will go into your hotel room. In the room, Ashton (if you 



have him) says that he regrets being able to enter the tournament due to 



technical difficulties (the dragons). Rena starts to wonder wheter or not 



Dias will really be entering. Rena tells you that she's going on a walk, 



and leaves the room. Ashton and/or Celine say that Rena has probably just 



been worrying about Claude. Your party goes to sleep for the night. 







The screen fades away, and you will now see a message saying about how 



Rena always seemed to be very preoccupied with something during the days 



before the tournament. The next day, you will view the outside of the 



castle. Claude tells about how many people from all across the world came 



to view the tournament. 







You will now wake up inside of the inn, and everyone is set to leave for 



the tournament. Go north, to the castle area. The receptionist will tell 



you to head to the battle area on the second level of the castle.







When you talk to the person at the counter, the receptionist takes all of 



your weapons and armor, and gives you the equipment from the sponsor. You 



now must wait in the waiting room until your match starts. You now get to 



see Dias walk in. Dias asks if his equipment is ready, the receptionist 



says that he should check the store. Rena tells Dias that Gamgee's stuff 



isn't ready yet. Dias tells Rena that it isn't any of her business. Rena 



gets slightly mad at Dias, since she was the one that introduced Dias to 



Gyamgee. Dias now tells you that it was all a coincidence, and leaves the 



arena area. Claude now gets upset at Rena for giving help to Dias in the 



tournament rather then himself. Rena tells Claude that she is going with 



Dias, and Claude gets rather upset. Claude wonders which side Rena is on, 



and Rena wonders why Claude would say such things about her. Claude says 



"It's because of the things you do!", and Rena runs out, sad. Ashton and 



Celine (assuming they are in your party) will berate Claude for what he 



just did.







Enter the waiting room and talk to a few of the fighters here. After you 



speak with three fighters, a soldier comes in and calls for two fighters,  



"Amon Rau" and "Claude Kenni". Your first match is now coming up. Your 



characters will now split up and encourage Claude, and your party members 



will be watching Claude. You can now check your equipment and items. You 



can also assign Killer Moves to Claude now. I suggest "Air Slash" and 



"Shooting Stars". You will now enter your first battle of the tournament.







*Note: It is very important to get to the last round of the tournament. 



If you don't get there, you can't get the weapons/armor you got from your 



sponsor, and you can't get the Sharp Edge. You will really *need* Sharp 



Edge because by using Customize with it you can make the best weapon in 



the game, and you can't get it any other way in the game. It is possible 



to proceed with the game if you loose immediately, but you will really 



want to get to the last round with Dias so you can get all of the items.







Amon Rau



HP: 2,000



No strengths/weaknesses







Amon Rau is really easy. Just keep doing normal attacks. If you're getting 



damaged on him, just keep using the Air Slash Killer Move. He should really 



be incredibly easy, though, so if you're taking big damage, you might have 



a tough time with a few of the future arena battles.







After you win your first fight, you will be able to wander around the area 



and find out what happened to Rena. Walk back to your party members that 



were watching you fight. Rena will arrive here just before Dias wins his 



match. Now, a guard will come in and tell Claude that it's his turn to 



fight, and the party will wish him luck. You can no check your equipment 



and items before you start the fight.







Dol Adan



HP: 2,750



No strengths/weaknesses







Dol Adan is also quite easy. Just keep using Air Slash Killer Moves at 



him from a distance, or Shooting Stars if you're in close. Try not to 



get too close to him, though, since he has a special punch that makes 



you dizzy. Get rid of him as soon as possible with all your long range 



Killer Moves. He's pretty strong, though, and if you took Knockout for 



the Long Edge, it could be quite hard. Just keep your distance.







You will now go straight for the third fight. You only have a chance 



to check your weapons and items, then you will have to go fight. This 



fight is the hardest one so far.







Worzay Durahan



HP: 4,000



No strengths/weaknesses







This enemy is very tough. Dish out all Killer Moves that you can at 



him. Shooting Stars is very useful here. Keep Air Slashing until he 



comes near you, then dish out Shooting Stars when he is just in range 



for the long range Shooting Stars. Keep this up and you should win. 



He is much faster than Dol Adan, though, so be careful. If you need 



to use your healing items, do so now.







*Note: If you are playing Galaxy or Universe mode, the enemies that 



  Dias fights are so incredibly tough that they can actually *kill* 



  Dias! Nothing special happens, though, and the game passes as if 



  Dias always won, but it's a fairly weird bug.







Now you will get a large break to explore the arena once more. Talk 



to a few people, then go back to your party. You will watch as Dias 



wins another battle very easily. Claude starts to get worried about 



fighting Dias, but he doesn't show it to the other characters. He 



will now get called back for the final match with Dias. You will get 



to fight Dias. Dias warns you that he will not hold back at all when 



he is fighting you.







Dias



HP: ????







You cannot win against Dias no matter how hard you try. You always 



do 0 damage to him, so don't waste your time. About the only thing 



you can do is keep using your Killer Moves so you can build up the 



Proficiency. ^_^ Just go down like a good sport.







Dias is announced as the winner. Rena runs out of the spectator area 



to find him. The rest of the party follows Rena. Your party will now 



end up in the waiting room, where Claude is stunned and has fallen. 



Claude will wake up, and he will wonder what happened, saying that he 



doesn't remember anything that happened at all. The party informs him 



that he lost to Dias in the final round. Dias will now enter, and the 



party will wonder what he wants. Dias tells Claude that it has been a 



long time since he had to get serious in a fight, and that Claude was 



a good fighter. Rena gets slightly angry because the two are fighting, 



and Dias leaves. Dias says that they will meet again if the time comes. 



The party will suggest that you pick up your runner-up prizes at your 



sponsor, and Claude will suggest that the party get going. You won't 



be able to collect the prizes if you lost before fighting Dias, though, 



and it's imperative that you get to Dias, so it wouldn't be a good idea 



to proceed without getting to Dias. Anyway, head to the weapon shop in 



which you were sponsored.







Go to your sponsor, and they will give you whatever that shop's prize 



was. If you picked Knockout, you will now get to own the Long Edge, and 



that will be the best weapon in the game for quite awhile. Now, heas to 



the west side of town, and go into the lone house in which you couldn't 



enter before because a girl sent you away. You can now talk to Gamgee 



at his house, and he will talk to Claude about the tournament. He tells 



you that Dias left something for you, and he gives you the Sharp Edge. 



(Do *not* get rid of this sword! Don't sell it, don't make anything else 



out of it until you have Mithril! Don't sell it!!!) I hope I've gotten my 



point across, because the best weapon in the game can only be made from 



this sword. Several people seem to either sell the sword, or not even go 



to see Gamgee in the first place, so whatever you do, do not get rid of 



it.







Now, the quest continues, and your new mission is to try to translate the 



Ancient Writings that you found way back in Cross Cave.

@node CC-8 "Opera's Subquest"



                     --Chapter 8: Opera's Subquest--



@{" Opera's Centerfold " LINK "extras/Opera.ilbm/MAIN"}



This chapter is about the task you have to go through to get Opera in 



your party. If Ashton is in your party, or if you don't want Opera at 



all, just skip this chapter and go to Chapter 9. For information on 



getting Opera, read on. To see any of the events that occur in this 



chapter, you must have seen the Private Action in Cross in which your 



characer bumps into a three-eyed man. You cannot get Opera or Ernest 



at all if you haven't seen this Private Action. If you have missed that 



Private Action, skip this chapter.







Go back to Hilton. Go to the bar there, and you will see a scuffle with 



a man and a woman. The woman was in a drinking contest with the man, and 



the man answers the woman's question and says he hasn't seen anyone with 



three eyes. The woman eventually begins to leave the place, but then she 



bumps into your party. The woman asks you if you've seen a three-eyed man. 



Claude answers "Yes, I have." The woman says that she didn't think you 



would have seen him. But then, the woman perks up again, and says "Oh, you 



said you did see a three-eyed man!". The woman is very surprised, and she 



asks you where you saw the man. Claude tells her that he saw the man in 



Cross. The woman thanks you and introduces herself as Opera Vectra. She 



now leaves the bar. To get her, you must follow her. Use the boat to the 



Cross continent and go to Cross Castle.







Talk to the king of Cross. You can now ask him a fourth question, about 



a woman with three eyes. The king tells you that she came here and left 



for the Mountain Palace after hearing about the three-eyed man. Claude 



says that it is a palace by the large lake of Coll. Claude asks the king 



permission to enter the Mountain Palace, and the king allows it. The king 



tells you to be careful, though, since the enemies in the Mountain Palace 



are tough. Before you leave, the king gives you 10,000 Fol. Now, head to 



the Mountain Palace. It's on top of a ridge near the large body of water. 







Mountain Palace



*Item Info: Lunar Tablet, Crystal, ?Herb (Artemis Leaf), ?Jewelry (Shiny 



Earring), Resurrection Bottle, Cure Stone, Sweet Syrup, Crest Rod, Amber 



Robe, ?Mineral (Damascus), Wolfsbane, Fairy's Cologne, Damascus, Emerald 



Ring, Fairy's Statue, Cestus, ?Mineral (Orihalcon)







*Enemey Info: 



Archer, Funnythief, Hood, Hounddog, Petrogerell, Sandglass, Slime Pool







The king wasn't telling you the truth about the enemies in the Mountain 



Palace. The enemies here are the same that you've seen around Lacour and 



Hilton, and if you were fighting on the field on Lacour continent, you 



won't have trouble at all. Just make sure you have the best equipment on 



each character from Lacour. The Petrogerells are slightly fatal though, 



since they can Petrify. The Slime Pools are also especially dangerous 



since they can Paralyze. If you don't have Dispel for Rena, make sure to 



bring several Cure Stones and Cure Paralyzes.







If you proceed on the east side of the cave, you will find Opera near a 



broken pillar. Opera is surprised that you were sneeking up on her, and 



she reacts by pulling out her large bazooka. Opera then realizes who it 



is, and asks you what you're doing here. Claude pulls Opera aside and 



asks her if she's really from this planet. Opera realizes that Claude is 



from another planet as well, and Claude wonders why Opera is here because 



it breaks the Interplanetary Protection Treaty. Opera really doesn't know 



what to say, and Rena asks what you are talking about. Opera chuckles a 



bit, and says that she's here looking for her boyfriend, Ernest, who ran 



away to conduct research. Opera says that Ernest probably broke through 



here and is probably deeper in the cave. You now can choose whether or 



not you want to join Opera in the cave.







1) Yes, let's go together.



2) Maybe it isn't such a good idea.







Pick option 1 and Opera will join your group. This is basically the choice 



you have of having Opera stay in the group. If you pick the second option, 



Opera will go in the cave alone, and you won't be able to get her again.



If you pick the first option, Opera then joins the party.







When you venture deep into the cave, you will come across two red lizards 



that are on the ground. Claude and Opera say that Ernest probably came 



through here and killed them. Opera goes close to the lizards, and they 



suddenly begin to move. Claude notices their movements and is surprised. 



You will now have to fight the two Flarelizards.







Flarelizard (2)



HP: 5000 



Strength: Fire, Lightning



Weakness: Ice







The Flarelizards are a very tough battle, one of the toughest you will 



have to face in the entire game, actually. You should be at a pretty 



high level here, and Opera should probably have at least some strength 



enhancing skills before you fight them. It's a wise idea to level up a 



lot before you do this battle, because this battle is even slightly 



unbalanced. Anyway, it is a very bad idea to fight the Flarelizards 



straight on with normal combat. They use a fire breathing attack that 



can kill characters outright, especially if you aren't at high levels. 



Give Claude Head Splitter and Shooting Stars Killer Moves. You will be 



using Head Splitter the most, as you can avoid damage from the area of 



the battlefield. The Flarelizards are very big enemies, and you will 



hit with Head Splitter often for a lot of damage. Opera won't be very 



valuable at all for this battle, but give her the Flame Launcher Killer 



Move anyway. The Flarelizards are strong to fire, but it's better than 



nothing. Make Celine continuously casting Energy Arrow. Focus on one 



Flarelizard at a time, and keep using Head Splitter. Try to avoid being 



in front of the Flarelizards. Once you destroy one, sandwich the other 



immdediately and keep belting away with Shooting Stars or normal attack. 



It's a tough battle, but if you're at the right levels, you'll make it.







After you kill the Flarelizards, Rena starts to feel sorry for them since 



they were probably just protecting their home. Opera tells her that she 



can't feel sorry for each thing she's killed. Head in the east door and 



proceed farther into the cave.







The last room in the cave is empty, but it looks like it has been used 



fairly recently. It looks like a scientist of some kind has been here, 



and Opera says that it could be Ernest. Opera starts to wonder where she 



should look next, and Renas suggests that Opera joins your party to look 



for Ernest.







You can go to Linga now, but there is a special little subquest to get 



a special weapon you will use much later in the game. If you want to do 



this little quest, read on. If you don't want the special weapon, go to 



the next chapter. 







Go to Salva. You will find a traveler in a white outfit there, and he 



will say that he is lost, and wonders where Herlie is. Tell him that it 



is to the north. Now, go to Mars. He'll be lost again in the town. Tell 



him that Herlie is even more to the east. Now, go to Herlie and take a 



ship to Hilton. You will find Radol there again, and he'll still be lost! 



Tell him to take a ship back, and the city he comes to is Herlie. :) If 



you go back to Herlie, you can find him in a room in the inn, and he will 



thank the party and give you the Funny Slayer. You will not use the Funny 



Slayer for a *long* time in the game, as it has attack power of 1, and 



will be utterly useless for the normal game. It comes into effect late in 



the bonus dungeon, though, as it kills all enemies named "Funny" in one 



hit, no matter how much damage you do. 







Your next quest is to get the Ancient Writings translated. Head to Linga, 



it's to the east of Lacour Castle.

Linga is a small and quiet town, but it is known for its University in 



which many people from around Expel are attending. The scholars here are 



studying many types of sciences, and Keith Klaser the famous linguist is 



home to Linga.







Make sure to do your shopping here first. The skill guild here has new sets 



of skills, and you'll want to pick them all up. The item shops here also 



carry many special items for Item Creations, so you'll want to pick some up 



here as well. Also, get a few Resurrection Bottles if you have enough Fol. 







Go to the translator's house. It's in the center of the village on the left 



side. When you go in, a man will stop you from going farther. You say that 



you need a translator to help you translate the Ancient Writings, and the 



man says that Keith is busy. He tells you that you need an apointment to 



visit with Keith, and it will be about a month before you will actually be 



able to speak with him. Your party is slightly mad, and the man forces you 



out of the house.







Go to the north end of town. Go to the small shop on the left side, and 



talk to the man there. Your party asks the man if he knows a translator. 



The man says that he knows Keith. Your party asks the man if he could 



help them talk to him, because they don't want to waith a month because 



they are on the run. The man says that Keith has been busy translating 



scrolls and can't talk to people right now. Claude asks if a scroll from 



Cross Cave is good enough for him to translate. The clerk now  introduces 



himself as Bowman Jean. He says that if you can find a unidetified herb



for him in the Sanctuary of Linga he will bring you to Keith. Claude is 



slightly surprised, wondering how he's ever going to find an herb that 



hasn't been identified yet. Bowman warns the party that there are many 



tough monsters there, but the party decides to go, since it's the only 



way. Go to the Sanctuary of Linga. It's the cave area right across from 



Linga village. 







Sanctuary of Linga



*Item Info: 



Ruby, Might Chain, Mixed Syrup, Rainbow Diamond, Poison Check, Rose Hip,



Twin Edge, ?Guard (Rune Buckler), Cinderella Glass, Spring Water, Bubble 



Lotion Lavender, Aseras, Mandrake, Artemis leaf, Wolfsbane, Straight Punch 







*Enemy Info: 



Blackhound, Killerrabi, Mandrake, Ooze, Shynesslady, Wolfhead







If you went on either Ashton's Subquest or Opera's Subquest, the enemies 



here won't be too hard. This is a very good dungeon to gain experience 



in, and if you just acquired Opera, you'll want to build up her levels 



and skills here. This is also a good place to start building Killer Move 



Proficiency, because you will start to heal MP with stamina and you can 



keep taking trips back to Linga to heal. Both Mandrakes and Oozes can 



paralyze and petrify you, but it shouldn't be a problem now because you 



are sure to have Dispel for Rena now. The dungeon is shaped quite weird, 



and there are many twists and turns here that you can get lost in. It's 



wise to stop for awhile to gather the treasures and gain levels, and then 



go toward the end in one trip. 







There are two types of herbs you can bring back to Bowman. The Clarisage 



and the Dillwhip. You can get the Clarisage very early in the cave, but 



you will have to venture far into the dungeon to get Dillwhip. I don't 



think it matters at all which herb you get, but the Clarisage has already 



been discovered, and the Dillwhip has not. It doesn't matter which herb 



you bring back to Bowman, though, because the story will proceed as usual 



and Bowman will still take you to Keith no matter which herb you get. 







Fighting the boss at the end of this dungeon is optional, but to fight it, 



you must head through a wall in the northeastern area of the dungeon, and 



it is pretty tough to spot normally. You will have to fight three Visseyers. 







Visseyer (3)



HP: 10,000



Strength: Void



Weakness: Light, Lightning







The Visseyers are pretty abnormal for bosses. They're not strong, but they 



have several strange attacks. Number one, they can poison you, but that 



shouldn't be too much of a problem because Rena will use Antidote on the 



party members that are poisoned. They can also eat your characters whole 



if you get to close to them. When a character is eaten, you will have to 



wait for the other characters to hit that Visseyer before your character 



can get out again. Your best bet here is to keep using long range Killer 



Moves, and Celine's attack spells. It shouldn't be too hard if you are at 



the right levels. Claude's Shooting Stars, Ashton's Leaf Slash, Opera's 



Flame Launcher are all useful Killer Moves to use here.







Once you've beaten the boss, Rena notes that this is probably a graveyard 



for many old creatures. You can now take the herb back to Bowman.







When you bring back the Clarisage, Bowman won't be too surprised because 



that herb has been discovered, but he will still take you to Keith because 



you are strong and your cause is good. If you brought back the Dillwhip, 



Bowman is very surprised because you are very strong to have found it in 



the cave with the monsters. Bowman will now take you over to Keith's house 



to talk to him.







When you get to Keith's house, Bowman will tell the man at the front to 



let them talk to Keith. The man goes in the house and comes back moments 



later, and allows your party in. Keith is working on translations, and 



is surprised when he sees how many people have entered his room. Bowman 



tells Keith that your party needs to get a certain scroll translated that 



they found in Cross Cave. Keith tells you that he will work on your scroll, 



and Rena hands it to him. He says that the scroll is written in an ancient 



language that is different than normal. Keith says that he will be glad to 



translate your scroll, but it may take time. Keith then thanks Bowman for 



giving him the scroll, and the entire group laughs because someone as high 



and important as Keith is thanking someone.







Bowman now asks the party to stay at his house that night. You will then 



end up in Bowman's house. Go upstairs and into the bedroom, Bowman will 



be there. Bowman is surprised that you are researching the Sorcergy Globe, 



and Bowman tells Claude that he might need someone with experience and 



knowledge of science, and basically asks to join the group if you didn't 



pick up Precis earlier through the Linga Private Action. You then have 



two choices.







1) Please join us!



2) But what about your wife?







If you want Bowman in your party for the rest of the game, choose the 



first option. If you're trying to make a decision here, I suggest *not* 



taking Bowman. In my opinion, he is the least useful of all characters 



in the game.







*If Bowman is in your party:



Your party wakes up and is ready to leave. If Bowman joined the group, 



a party member will say that he should say goodbye to his wife. Bowman 



says a general and casual goodbye to his wife, and tells your party 



that you should head to Lacour Castle to see what is going on. Claude 



says that you could probably get a ship to El continent from there.







*If Bowman is not in your party:

You are waiting outside the door of Bowman's house. Bowman tells you 

to be careful on your journey. Bowman also tells Rena to look after 

Claude on the adventure. Rena hints at visiting Lacour continent. She 

says that you could get a boat from the king of Lacour to El continent. 


Now, head back to Lacour Castle, and the adventure continues...

@node C-PRIVATE-ACTION "Private Actions"

---------------------

Private Action List:

---------------------


************************  @{FG fill}GO ON TO THE@{FG text} @{"CITY LIST" link CITYLIST}  ****************



Every character in your party has his or her own affections for 



each of the other characters in the party. Characters with higher 



affection toward characters will assist that person more in the 



game through combat situations, like having an Anger Explosion 



more often. The main factor that affects the emotional levels 



of the characters is through Private Actions. Here is a list of 



all of the one-time Private Actions in the game for Claude, and 



the results of each of the choices. If you have found a Private 



Action that I haven't, I would really appreciate if you would 



submit it to me, as I am sure I am missing many Private Actions 



since I have not gotten all possibly combinations of characters, 



nor have I gone to every village at every point in the game.



Also, if you do give me a submission, make sure it is unique. I 



am not looking for Private Actions that can be done through the 



entire game.







Here is the key I will be using to note how much of a change 



in emotional level occurs:







5: Big increase in emotional level.



4: Slight increase in emotional level.



3: No change in emotional level.



2: Slight decrease in emotional level.



1: Big decrease in emotional level.







The corresponding number will be placed beside each choice you 



make. The name in parenthesis that follows this number notes 



who the character(s) is that will be affected by the choice.

HEY, HOW DO I USE THOSE NUMBERS?
I'll now explain to you how to alter you characters, so you can get the
groups and couples you want in the 1 out of 87 endings you will recieve.
First, here is how the computer tabulates endings-
1-Game checks for characters with relationship points 10 or above.
2-Totals the values.
3-The pair with the most relationship points becomes a couple for your
ending.
4-Then the game does the process over again, until all the people with
10 or above are linked up, and all eligable pairs are made ending
couples.
It is kind of complicated, but you will get used to it. Also please note
that same-sex end couples are like best friends, while different-sex
couple get together, so don't go thinking you can get Rena and Precis
"together", cause you can't, you just can't you pervert.
WHAT IF IT IS A TIE?
If more than 2 people have the same amount of relationship points, the
computer will sort them out by this TIE Breaker Table-
1-Claude
2-Rena
3-Celine
4-Bowman
5-Dias
6-Precis
7-Ashton
8-Leon
9-Opera
10-Ernest
11-Noel
12-Chisato
OH MAN! NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
Easy-I'll use the example from the Prima Guide. If Claude, Rena, Opera,
and Chisato end the game with the same relationship points, the
ending-couples would be sorted Claude+Rena and Chisato+Opera. It goes in
the order of the list.
SOME MORE. . .
Note that some ending couples have different versions of that couples
ending. This is determined by whose points are greater for the other.
So, if Claude and Opera are an ending-couple, you'd get a different
ending if Claude had more points, and a different ending if Opera had
more points. Easy, right?
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE LEVEL OF TWO PEOPLE, WHEN ONE IS NOT A MAIN
CHARACTER?
Ah, this is where it gets difficult, but not impossible, and with
practice, you'll be able to pick you endings with relative ease. Here
are some helpful things you can do to try to help you get the ending you
want.
Books-Using the Super Specialty "Publishing" any character can write a
book, and have it published. Each character can write two books, one
rare and the other common. The common books increase(or decrease,be
careful!!!!!)the reader's FRIENDSHIP level toward the author to 8
points, and the rare books do the same, but with you ROMANTIC level. If
you want to have a REALLY REALLY good chance at picking your endings
easily, learn "Publishing as early as you can. Machinery and Writing
skills create Publishing. I usually learn Perserverance to lv.10
first(you always should!), then increase writing to lv.5(it will take 5
skill points with perserverance maxed out). Next, just keep devoting
points to mech knowledge and mech operation to get good at machinery. It
is not that hard to get publishing early in the game. Until you get some
Fountain Pens, keep your Private Actions to a minimum. Once you get a
good flow of publishing, just get the rare book for you character, and
let whoever you want to love you read it. Their level will now be
automatically 8 for your love(which will also fix any Private Actions
you messed up^_^). This is a good way to set up the characters you want
to hook up. After you accomplish this successfully, you can just have
these 2 love birds fight in about 200 battles together, and they will
both be at 10 for their love level, but what if they are not in you
battle party?! or if you don't want to walk around for 6 hours fighting
to get 2 people to hook up?! Okay, okay, hold on. Be aware that if you
have you main character be mean to both of the characters you want to
get together, it really, really, increases chances. I'm pretty sure the
less the people like the main character, the more points get put toward
other people. For example, if you are Rena, and you want Claude and
Celine to get together, just be real mean to them both. Pick the option
in Private Actions you think will reduce Relation points the most. For a
short time after eating their favorite food, a character seems more like
to be nice and build points toward another character, and also if you
have orchestra playing during private action scenes important to your
chosen ending pair you are trying to hook up, the points increase is
more effective, and more so if that character has their favorite
instrument in you inventory somewhere. Also, most people that are not
Claude or Rena have at LEAST one or two Private Actions where they talk
and stuff, and the trick is to be as unhelpful and mean as you can, and
force the two characters to help themselves, and raise points.(I don't
know why the best weapon is there, it just looked good) Overall, though,
fighting together seems to be the most affective in hooking up non-main
character couples together. Also, it appears that if you show a lot of
attention to another character, the character with the highest number of
points for you will start to decrease, so this means that you don't have
to be a jackass the whole game just to get people together, just be a
jackass to them.
OKAY, THEN HOW DO I HOOK UP MY MAIN CHARACTER MORE AFFECTIVELY?
Easy-Private Actions. All the tricks above will work, and work well, but
you have the private action advantage! There is no reason NOT to end up
with who you want ot end up with concerning your main character. Just be
nice to them, and mean to everyone else. You can't pair with more than
one person, afterall. I have seen so many of my friends be nice to every
character when Claude, and then complaining when he got with Rena again,
in the same way. I tell them, and they say "I know, but I can't be mean
to Celine, Rena, etc."WELL YOU HAVE TO BE!!!
FINAL WRAP-UP AND A LITTLE NEW THING
The little new thing is just an explanation that may help you. For every
Private Action choice, there are 5 ways it will affect the other
characters feelings for you.BIG AFFECT=2 point increase, SMALL AFFECT=1
point increase, EH. . . . =no change,POO-HEAD=1 point lost,
POO-POO-HEAD!!!!=2 points lost. Every choice you make in a PA will fall
into one of these categories. The Fav-Food thing, and the Orchestra will
always be positive, so they increase everything 1, and if they are
happening at the same time, it will be two points. So if Claude eats
steak, then plays on his Silver Trumpet in the Orchestra, you CANNOT
decrease you points(which as you know by now, can be good, or bad!). Oh
yeah!!! I got a couple of weird endings. As Rena, Celine can do 3
Private Actions outside of Cross, eventually leading here to marry the
Prince of Cross as here ending. Doing this closes here off as a
character for an end-couple. As Rena again, the same thing can be done
for Ashton and Eleanor, with 3 PA's outside of Herlie. And if you have
Opera, but don't take the steps to get Ernest, her ending will be her
waiting for him to return to her. Again, this cuts here off as an
end-couple, so just get Ernest because Claude and Opera's endings are
cool! There might be more of these strange endings I missed, but I doubt
it.
IN CLOSING. . . .
Well, I sure hope after reading this(maybe, just maybe, understanding it
fully your first time)you can start picking your ending couples. It will
take a few time through(after I went through about 8 times, I really got
a good hold of it, and for my 9th ending, I saw everything I wanted.
This was my first FAQ, and I enjoyed writing it, and I hope it helps you
find your soul mate, no matter how many hearts you have to cruely
crush.^_^C'YA!!!!!

their properties in the next update.  Also, all Characters except Ernest 
should have items in the next update(forgot to get him, I'll have to 
wait until universe mode for his items).


*************************
2. Metalworking Overview
*************************

In order to be able to work with the metal, a character must learn the 
skills Craft(Technique 2), Esthetic Sense(Sensibility 1) and 
Mineralogy(Knowledge 1).  The secret talents "Originality" and 
"Dexterity" may be unlocked through metalwork, unlocking the talents of 
a person gets you 100 skill points for that person.  If a character 
doesn't know these skills, usually if you use a Super Specialty 
Orchestra and choose Item Creation => Metalwork, a character has a 
better chance of learning because Orchestra increases you chance of a 
successful session.  While it is possible to make items with a skill 
level less than ten, it is recomended that your level be ten.  Most 
common metals can be bought in tool shops, with the exception of: 
Moonite, Sage's Stone, Star Ruby and Rainbow Diamond which can be 
created through alchemy, or bought in level six of the Heraldic 
Cave/Secret Dungeon from one of Santa's Associates which randomly 
appears there.

**************************
3. Blacksmithing Overview
**************************

To be able to blacksmith your party members must know the specialties 
Customize and Alchemy.  You must also have the item Smith's Hammer.  
Mithril, Sage's Stone, Meteorite, Damascus, Moonite and Orichalcum must 
be bought in level six of the Secret Dungeon.  Some enemies rarely drop 
these also.

Blacksmithing, being a super specialty, requires that as many people in
the party as possible have maxed levels of the specialty, for a higher
success rate.

*******************
4. Metalwork Items
*******************

These are the items each person can produce from the skill metalwork.  
Iron is omitted due to the lack of usefulness of the items I was able to 
create with it(Paralyze/Stone/Poison Checks if your lucky).  Precis, 
Dias, Ernest and Opera will be added at a later time, I am not far 
enough in my games to be able to make their items yet.  Each character 
is able to make about 4 different items(I'm guessing four for each gem, 
but I haven't been able to get them all)from each gem.  Using the Super 
Specialty Orchestra increases the chance of a successful session.  The 
sayings are what the person says when they mess up.

***********************************
6. SP Building Tips/Getting Metals
***********************************
The fastest way to get SP is to fight in the battle arena in Fun City,
in Nede. If you go through the solo duel battles, on the highest level,
the last creature you fight is one of those large green things that you
normally encounter in the tower of the wise men. It'll net you about
75,000 exp.

        If you go through the bully mode, on the highest level, you'll not 
only
level once (I leveled once every time through it, until I broke level 95
or so), but you'll also score 100 SP at the end for completing the bully
battle. Good way to earn double SP for a while.

        So what do you do to keep from getting slaughtered in those modes? 
Hope
you stole a lot while you were pickpocketing earlier .. there's an item
called the Battle Suit, it's 500ac armor, you steal it from one of the
people on board Ronixis' ship when you get beamed there. It makes Claude
(or whoever wears it - everyone can, sadly it isn't copyable)
practically invincible to physical attack. Creatures won't be able to
harm him until you're dealing with the wisemen, heraldry, or things in
the wisemen's tower.

In any case. Needing rare materials?

        Go to Giveaway. Hang around outside and fight the creatures on 
that
island. Sometimes they give nothing, but more often (and I mean -often-,
this won't even take five battles to find) they drop multiple pieces of
Meteorite and Orihalcum. It seems to be really popular.

        On that same island, you can make heavy use out of the Survival 
skill.
Walk into the wooded areas on that island and use the skill repeatedly.
I don't know what talents help the skill, everyone in my party seemed to
do it pretty well (when they were at the same level). From that island,
using survival, I've netted moonite, meteorite, damascus, orihalcum,
sage's stones (two back to back, once), and even one piece of mithril
(which, by far, seems the hardest stuff to acquire).

Heya guys, first I wanna let u know that this is ma first FAQ.
So, lets get to the point, shall we ?

To do this, at least you have reached Fienal and already went to the save
point before fighting Indalecio. Save there, and go to the Fun City.
At the "Battle Square" you should find an old man with a green clothes.
He should be in the back of the Colloseum. Talk to him, and he will ask you
about reuturning past memories. Choose "Yes" twice and POOF! Youe should be
back at Arlia. Yeah, Expel's Arlia. Go outside and u will find your Synard
waiting for you outside. Now go to the Island at the lower left at the map.
Some kind of "Desert" type island. There should be a dungeon there.

This is Star Ocean 2's bonus dungeon. At Star Ocean 1 this kind of bonus
dungeon exists too. But beware ! NO SAVE POINTS ! And the enemies here are
EXTREMELY powerful. I came here at the level 101, and the enemies killed me
a few times here. And without proper equipments, they should beat you like
"Stealing a lolipop from a baby" thing. Err.. you should stock up 
Blueberries
Ressurection Mists, Ressurection Bottles, Blackberries, oh yeah.. you better
master the skill "Herbal Medicine" and "Compounding", plus buy Lizard Flask,
Lavenders, Acerasses and Artemis Leaves.
With compounding Lavender + Aceras = Ressurection Mist, etc
                 Artemis Leaf + Aceras = Ressurection Mist, etc

Oh yeah, I forgot something. At [Energy Nede] there's two big Ice Islands.
One is "The field of power" And another one is an island with "Giveaway"
town in it. Between those islands there should be two small islands. Land
at the "Stick"-like island, and start searching the island. There's a secret
shop "The Fake Gallery" selling Mithril Armours, Helmets,and "Magical Rasp"
an item that took a great part at creating items from "Blacksmith".
B U Y   T H O S E   I T E M S !  Those Armors should be your best equipments
for now. Then you can safely raid the "Cave of trials"-the name of the bonus
dungeon.

Well, I add some items that you could create from Blacksmith and Customize,
but I think I'll put it after the FOL trick.

OK, this is the FOL trick.

First, you have to learn the skill "Tool knowledge" so your selling prices
will increase, this skill MUST be as level 10, so you better learn "Preser-
verance".

Second, learn "Metalwork" and "Identify" specialties

Metalwork requirements : Mineralogy, Craft and Esthetic Sense
Identify  requirements : Mineralogy, Tool knowledge and Herbal Medicine

Work 'em out so those skills are on level 10.

Third, work out your FOLs so that you have at least 2.000.000 FOL
You can do this easily by publishing books, and go to Lacour.
A publishing company is opening a branch there. Sell your books, the rarer,
the better. Each character can create 3 kind of book.
One is the normal book, one is the rare book, and the other is a
"Crumpled Paper" heheheheheh-just joking :>

Name : Normal book - Rare book

Claude  : Planet of the winds - Ocean of stars
Rena    : I can only see you  - Falling in love
Precis  : Buy it.... OK ?     - A maiden's secret
Celine  : The world is mine   - Lady in Red
Chisato : But one truth !     - Killer's book
Ashton  : Mr.No               - "Haven't discovered it yet"
Leon    : "Haven't discovered it yet"
Ernest  : Countdown           - "Haven't discovered it yet"
Noel    : Living with animals - "Haven't discovered it yet"
Opera   : "Haven't discovered it yet"
Dias    : The Bloody Path     - Live

You should earn a LOT of Fol after doing this, but you can get more.
After selling those books, wander around a little while, build up levels
then go talk to the man, he will say something about CopyRight Money, and
he will hand you the money. Talk to him once again, this time BUY your books
buy each book 5, and go back to [Energy Nede]. Back to Central City and go 
to
the Nede Publishing Company and do the same thing again.

Fourth, customize your weapons. Here's the customizing list :
Note : [Weapon] + [Ore] means you can choose any weapon and any ore to 
combine
       (Weapon) + Orihalcum means u can choose any weapon and Orihalcum to
       combine


*Claude:
Eternal Sphere: Minus Sword + Mithril
Minus Sword: Sharp Edge + Mithril
Silvance: (Weapon) + Orihalcon
Aura Blade: [Weapon] + [Ore]
Grandsting: Sharp Edge + Damascus

*Rena:
Empresia: Kaiser Knuckle + Moonite
Sorceress Knuckle: Magical Glove + Rune Metal
Kaiser Knuckle: [Weapon] + [Ore]

*Bowman:
Ashura: Titan Fist + Rainbow Diamond
Kaiser Knuckle: [Weapon] + [Ore]
Moon Fist: Rune Full Moon + Diamond
Titan Fist: Hecatonkale + Iron, Giant Fist + Rainbow Diamond

*Ernest:

Invisible: Light Whip + Mithril

*Dias:
Whirlwind: [Weapon] + Meteorite
Crimson D:  [Weapon] + Star Ruby
Hard Cleaver: Breeze Hope + Rainbow Diamond
Soul Slayer: Hard Cleaver + Damascus
Ruins Fate: Minus Sword + Damascus

*Leon:
No no Kozo: [Weapon] + [Ore]
Ankoku no Sho: [Weapon] + Damascus
Konton no Sho: Ankoku no Sho + Damascus
Monshojutsu Riron: [Weapon] + Rune Metal
Monshojutsu Daijiten: Monshojutsu Riron + Moonite
Kodai no Shomotsu: Konton no Sho + Damascus

*Noel:
Tiger Fang: Felpar Nail + Crystal
Platinum Nail: Tiger Fang + Mithril
Serpent Tooth: Eagle Claw + Sapphire
Dragon Claw: [Weapon] + Moonite
Grizzly Clasp: Dragon Claw + Iron

*Chisato:
Flame Gun: [Weapon] + Star Ruby
Flare Gun: Flame Gun + Meteorite
Freeze: Shock Gun + Sapphire
Electron: [Weapon] + [Ore]
Cracker: [Weapon] + Damascus
Psychic Gun: Cracker + Kenja no Ishi
Shock Gun: [Weapon] + Mithril

Sorry I used Japanese b'coz I copied it from Exdeath (tm)'s FAQ, but I add
some new Items.

And the blacksmith list for your armours

*Note: Most Blacksmith armor depends on whether or not you have the
Magical Rasp support item. With the Magical Rasp, you can create better
armor than you would be able to normally.

Iron: Ring Mail, Knight Shield, Plate Greave, Plate Helm, Banded Helm
Orihalcum : Neo Greave, Barrier Shield, Barrier Armor, Hermit Helm, Rare 
Gauntlet
Damascus: Bloody Armor, Bloody Helm, Chaos Mail,  Core Plate
Moonite: Jeannie's Helm, Jeannie's Shield, Jeannie's Armor, Witch Boots
Mithril: Mithril Coat, Mithril Dress, Mithril Shield, Mithril Mesh
Meteorite: Star Cloak, Star Greave, Star Guard, Star Necklace
Rune Metal: Wizard Met, Wizard Mail, Rune Shoes, Rune Buckler

With the Magical Rasp:
Iron: All-purpose Knife, Plate Mail
Orihalcon: Odin Helm, Reflection Mail
Damascus: Duel Suit, Duel Helm, Algol
Moonite: Ishtar Robe, Isis Tiara, Kali Hand
Mithril: Pallas Athena
Meteorite: Sylvan Mail, Sylvan Helm, Sylvan Boots
Rune Metal: Mirage Robe, Taka no Hagoromo

Thats it, with the equipments above you will have the most deadly arsenal in
the whole RPG world.

Fifth, go through the "Cave of trials" until you reached "The Burglar's 
Nest"
you can find a "Door to Door"-Santa here, and he sells DAMN GOODIES to buy
think about it, all Minerals, including Damascus, Moonite, Meteorite, 
Mithril
Sage's Stone, Rune Metal, ==> Tri-Emblems <== , Go-Home Frogs, etc
here's the FOL trick :

* First, set your Identify All ! to "Give Discount"
* Buy Sage's Stone as much as you can
* Then, set your Identify All ! to "Raise Price"
* Sell the Sage's Stones

That's it !!
You bought them for 35000 FOL, then you sell 'em for 80000 FOL
there, count your profits ! You can earn 1.000.000 FOL each time.
Think if you can buy 'till 99... too bad you can only buy 20.

sell 80000 x 20 = 1.600.000
buy  35000 x 20 =   700.000  _
-----------------------------
profit          =   900.000

The Santa says "You just make your best decisions" or something like that
after you buy em, heheh I said "You just make yourself bankrupt" :>
after all he seems to have an unlimited pouch full of FOLs.

OK, tis's the end of my FAQ.
Mail to crescentsaber@hotmail.com for comments, critics and CASH :>
