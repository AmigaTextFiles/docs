@node "ACCEPT"

 ACCEPT

 Germany's Accept were never going to be as successful as their countrymen
 the Scorpions, but what they did achieve during their halcyon days was
 nothing short of spectacular. Formed in 1977, the band's classic line-up
 consisted of one Udo Dirkschneider (vocals), Wolf Hoffman (guitar),
 Hermann Frank (guitar), Peter Baltes (bass), and Stefan Kaufmann (drums),
 and they came together, it seems, with the express desire to be some sort
 of German @{"Judas Priest" link "JUDAS PRIEST"}. Certainly, they supported the Brummie metallers,
 and some of that polished chrome style rubbed off of them. Very much to
 the fore, the Accept sound boasted Dirkschneider's impossibly shrieked
 and snarled vocals and the bombastic twin riffing of Hoffmann and Franks.
 With this combination already in place, all that was required was some
 serious speed in the rhythm department and you had a proto-thrash band.
 Well, almost, because although their influence on the burgeoning thrash
 scene was evident, this lot trod a more controlled and melodic path.
 This was best exemplified by a stunning clutch of albums - 'Restless
 And Wild', 'Balls To The Wall', 'Metal Heart', 'Russian Roulette' -
 in the early to mid-'80s, which put them at the peak of their game.
 Sadly, Dirkschneider began to think his bandmates were going a little
 soft and he went solo in 1987, leaving them to flounder somewhat with
 a series of different singers. They split in 1989 and then reunited for
 a number of unspectacular metal efforts in the '90s.

@node "AC-DC"

 AC/DC

 Emerging from some of the roughest, toughest bars in Sydney back in 1973,
 these formidable Aussies have become virtually the biggest hard rock 'n'
 boogie band on the planet. Best known for the visual gimmick of lead
 guitarist Angus Young being dressed as a schoolboy - he literally was at
 school at the time they started - their reputation was, nevertheless,
 sealed by a string of classic albums in the '70s, featuring the unique
 whiskey-soaked rasp of vocalist Bon Scott. For simple, honest-to-goodness
 party-time boogie, AC/DC are, indisputably, the business, as can be
 witnessed on such cracking outings as 'Let There Be Rock', 'Powerage' and
 the world-shaking masterpiece that is 'Highway To Hell', where Scott's
 penchant for lewd 'n' crude, tongue-in-cheek lyrics achieved new heights
 - or should that be lows? - of un-PC vulgarity. Sadly, with the band
 teetering on the cusp of true worldwide recognition, the hard-living
 frontman's rocker lifestyle resulted in his alcohol-related death in
 February 1980. The band continued with ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson
 for what would become one of the all-time classic albums in rock history,
 'Back In Black'; a weighty, brilliant record the band have struggled,
 somewhat, to match over more recent years.

@node "AEROSMITH"

 AEROSMITH

 Few bands epitomise the mythical rock 'n' roll lifestyle with quite the
 same degree of conviction as Aerosmith. The legendary exploits of singer
 Steven Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry - let alone the other members - have
 passed into rock lore and led to them being dubbed the Toxic Twins for
 obvious reasons. Naturally, this would mean nothing were it not for the
 fact that, despite propping up half the Latin American economies through
 their chemical excesses, their hell-raising activities led to some damn
 fine records. Influenced by the blues, early r 'n' b and Motown, these
 five skinny white boys reinterpreted pretty much everything they heard
 as pure, sleazy hard rock, very much in the vein of their heroes the
 Rolling Stones, with a panache that would later be half-inched by the
 likes of world-conquerors @{"Guns N' Roses" link "GUNS N' ROSES"}. Their most successful attempt
 to capture their hedonistic attitude in the '70s was with 'Toys In The
 Attic' - a very loaded album title indeed - and the unsurpassable 'Rocks'.
 Despite a rocky patch in the early '80s, when Perry left to form the
 Joe Perry Music Project, the band reunited and on the back of mega-hit
 'Walk This Way' (with a little help from rap stars Run DMC), relaunched
 themselves. The superbly diverse 'Permanent Vacation', and the slick
 'Pump' saw them rein in the excesses somewhat and reinvent themselves
 as the hard rock band of choice for the MTV generation.

@node "ALICE COOPER"

 ALICE COOPER

 Alice Cooper the man - aka Vincent Furnier, born the son of a preacher
 - will forever be associated with the timeless teenage rampage of the
 1972 smash hit 'School's Out', but delve a little deeper and you'll
 discover a career punctuated with era-defining moments of hard rock
 genius. Originally Alice Cooper (taking the name, apparently, from
 a 17th century witch) was the name of the entire band - a moniker,
 they used to love telling people, which had been chosen for them by
 a ghostly spirit during a particularly spooky seance. As if that wasn't
 provocative enough to get moral guardians' blood boiling, they pioneered
 a style of trashy, glammy, shock rock, which has since been hijacked
 and bastardised by numerous pretenders to the throne, most notably
 @{"Marilyn Manson" link "MARILYN MANSON"}. Chief among these reputation building albums was the
 deliberately offensive 'Billion Dollar Babies', a mad splurge of brilliance
 celebrating the tacky decadence of '70s society. By 1975, however, the band
 had parted company and ol' Vince adopted the misanthropic Cooper persona
 himself. With legendary producer Bob Ezrin also on board, the usual
 revelling in the depravity of modern culture was sidetracked and they went
 for an overt horror slant instead. The result was the concept album,
 'Welcome To My Nightmare', one of the classiest rock albums to emerge from
 the '70s. The subsequent ten years brought a variety of different styles
 and records of varying quality. but it took 1989's ultra-commercial 'Trash'
 and hit single 'Poison' to brand Alice on the minds of the MTV generation,
 along with a superb cameo appearance in 'Wayne's World'. Since then, albums
 have appeared at regular intervals, the latest, 'Brutal Planet', being
 released in June 2000.

@node "ALICE IN CHAINS"

 ALICE IN CHAINS

 Often unfairly lumped in with the grunge phenomenon, not least because
 they emerged from Seattle in the late '80s, Alice In Chains did, in fact,
 enjoy something of a glammy origin as Diamond Lie around 1985. With those
 pretensions quickly subsumed by a much darker, brooding sound, captured
 most succinctly by guitarist Jerry Cantrell and the bleak vocal and lyrical
 rumblings of Layne Staley, they were clearly a very troubled bunch of lads
 who had obviously been dabbling rather too much with class A narcotics -
 in particular, smack. Whatever their chemical recreational habits, their
 'Facelift' debut was a solid enough affair, but their most dazzling opus
 was 1992's 'Dirt', featuring a number of songs which had already been
 given something of a decent test drive round the club circuit over the
 preceding years. These songs, including 'Dirt' and 'Rooster', would prove
 to be their most enduring, even after the grunge wave began to subside.
 Unfortunately, despite their obvious musical flexibility and creativity
 - witness the weirdly wonderful five-song EP 'Sap' - and their
 protestations that heroin chic was not their bag any more, it now appears
 that drug-induced instability has put the band into effective suspended
 animation for the time being.

@node "ANTHRAX"

 ANTHRAX

 Bermuda-shorted cartoon metal buffoons or long-running, defining
 progenitors of thrash? Or both? One of the most enduring bands of the '80s
 thrash wave, Noo Yoikers Anthrax experienced a very dodgy career launch
 with vocalist Neil Turbin and the execrable 'Fistful Of Metal' before
 ditching the loser, adopting the histrionic wail of Joey Belladonna and
 forging ahead at the vanguard of thrash. By the middle of the decade,
 this self-deprecating outfit ranked up there with the likes of @{"Megadeth" link "MEGADETH"}
 and @{"Metallica" link "METALLICA"} and their tough, street-level blitz resulted in such genre
 classics as the aptly titled 'Spreading The Disease' and 'Among The
 Living'. Their songs, inspired by everything from futuristic comic book
 cop Judge Dredd and various Stephen King novels (favourite author of
 songwriting guitarist Scott 'Not' Ian) to world peace and the plight of
 native Americans, marked them out as somewhat unique among their peers.
 Indeed, their dabblings with rap - the hit single 'I'm The Man' and the
 Chuck D assisted 'Bring The Noise' - indicated that they were far more
 inventive and flexible than most standard thrash outfits. With Belladonna
 out of the loop in the '90s and ex-Armored Saint singer John Bush as
 frontman, they continued to turn out tough gritty rock albums - such as
 'Sound Of White Noise' and 'Stomp 442' - despite a downturn in their
 fortunes.

@node "ASIA"

 ASIA

 Though this well-seasoned supergroup continued well into the '90s - with
 the albums 'Aqua' and 'Aria' after a break in the mid '80s - Asia never
 again achieved the same degree of success that greeted them when they
 first formed during the heady days of pomp rock. Back in 1981, Asia
 consisted of well-travelled rockers bassist John Wetton (ex-King Crimson),
 guitarist Steve Howe (ex-Yes), drummer Carl Palmer (ex-Emerson, Lake &
 Palmer) and keyboard player Geoff Downes (ex-Yes and, believe it or not,
 Buggles!). As you would expect from such a motley collection of old-school
 talent, they had a penchant for prog rock noodling par excellence with
 gloriously technical musical passages bringing to mind the genre excesses
 of the '70s. Fortunately, there was also a polished commercial edge to the
 songs and the ultra-smooth AOR pop of their 1982 eponymous debut kicked
 off with the hit single 'Heat Of The Moment'. The pop hits continued to
 flow with follow-up 'Alpha' and singles 'Don't Cry' and 'The Smile Has
 Left Your Eyes', but third album 'Astra' suffered greatly due to the
 disruption caused by line-up changes, a situation they never fully
 recovered from.

@node "ATARI TEENAGE RIOT"

 ATARI TEENAGE RIOT

 Speed metal, punk, techno, hardcore, acid house, drum 'n' bass - the list
 goes on and on and on. If you can think of a musical sub-genre, then
 chances are that Berlin noise-art terrorists Atari Teenage Riot have
 probably deployed it in their politically radical stance against racism
 and what they see as the general right wing shift in Western politics
 following the destruction of the Berlin Wall. Formed back in 1992 as
 a direct response to the genre and racial apartheid creeping into Germany's
 youth culture, Alec Empire, Hanin Elias and MC/DJ Carl Crack formed the
 Riot to openly challenge what they saw happening at a street level.
 Their sound featured enormous guitar riffs, impossibly speedy breakbeats
 and a great deal of edgy shouting. Their first single was the remarkable
 'Hunting For Nazis' and immediately marked them out as a band with true
 punk credentials who were in serious danger of giving the protest song
 genre a major shot of badly needed creative energy. Having released
 a number of singles under, ironically, major label Phonogram, they left
 when it became clear the label wanted more straight ahead techno-rock
 from them. With the leftover cash from their advance, in true punk
 fashion, they created Digital Hardcore Recordings and unleashed the
 albums 'Delete Yourself' and 'The Future War', as well as nurturing
 like-minded acts on the new label. The cool cult cache that came with
 such single-minded determination resulted in an inevitable growth in
 stature and support slots on tours with the likes of left-field artist
 Beck. As if confirmation of their staggering originality were need,
 1999's '60 Second Wipeout' was yet another bafflingly intense and
 confrontational blast of adrenalised noise.

@node "BAD BRAINS"

 BAD BRAINS

 The outright collision of punk and reggae sounds fairly unlikely as an
 approach to successful music, but if The Clash and their peers could pull
 it off, then why not? That, at least, was the theory behind Bad Brains,
 the outfit created by jazz fusion guitarist Dr Know (aka Gary Miller),
 after being inspired by the rank amateurism of punk and the political
 stance of Bob Marley. With such a radical approach to their sound and the
 volatile nature of street level culture in their hometown of Washington DC
 in the late '70s, Bad Brains quickly stirred up major interest on the
 underground punk scene. They would completely baffle their audiences by
 ripping through such classic early singles as 'Pay To Cum' and 'Big
 Takeover', then slow things down to a truly spiritual pace with some
 seriously heavy reggae, a gear shift ably controlled by vocalist HR's
 impossible vocal gymnastics. And if this approach foxed some people,
 then that was as nothing compared to the confusion caused by their apparent
 inability to release and distribute albums. Their full-length eponymous
 debut was a cassette-only release and it took until 1983's Ric Ocasek
 (The Cars) produced 'Rock For Light' for them to venture on to record.
 Even then, their next album 'I Against I' took almost four years to hit
 the shelves. Such erratic appearances in the public arena were already
 frustrating, but then the inevitable 'musical differences' took their toll,
 with half the band wanting to follow the reggae route and the other half
 opting for rock. The clash eventually led to a number of line-up changes
 from which the group, sadly, never fully recovered, but their overtly
 political influence and daring approach to punk rock is still evident
 in many of today's leading hardcore outfits.

@node "BAD COMPANY"

 BAD COMPANY

 Not many bands can boast a career quite as lengthy as Bad Company who
 formed back in 1973 from the disintegrated hard rockers @{"Free" link "FREE"}. With a
 line-up boasting the legendary Paul Rodgers (vocals), Simon Kirke (drums),
 ex-Mott The Hoople fella Mick Ralphs (guitar) and veteran Boz Burrell
 (bass), the band was often unfairly labelled as a soulless version of
 Free, but was actually a lot more successful; witness worldwide hit
 'Can't Get Enough' and superb albums such as their eponymous debut,
 'Straight Shooter' and 'Run With the Pack'. Hugely admired by @{"Led Zeppelin" link "LED ZEPPELIN"},
 they supported them on tour and eventually signed to their famed Swan Song
 label. With their tough, raw, bluesy sound, they effectively pioneered the
 slick and melodic hard rock sound that was polished to a commercial gleam
 by such AOR legends as Foreigner. Unfortunately, the late '70s and early
 '80s brought internal friction and a loss of momentum, even though they
 continued to be a major commercial success. Rodgers left to work with
 Jimmy Page in the Firm and the band continued with an ever-shifting
 line-up until last year, when all the original members were reunited for
 an extremely successful tour.

@node "BAD RELIGION"

 BAD RELIGION

 Southern California's Bad Religion are one of those rare entities -
 a hardcore punk band that have actually retained their underground
 credibility, while at the same time reaching massive audiences by
 eventually signing a major label deal. Formed back in 1980, the band was
 typical of the hardcore scene at the time, although there were inklings
 that their sheer talent and brazen attitude would take them well beyond
 their competent debut, 1983's 'Into The Unknown'. Interestingly, guitarist
 Brad Gurewitz established Epitaph Records around this time in order to
 release the band's product, with the result that it is now possibly the
 biggest punk label in the world (thanks mainly to the hit album 'Smash'
 provided by the @{"Offspring" link "OFFSPRING"}). Back in the '80s, the label was just a means
 to an end - it allowed the band to remain independent and creatively sharp,
 a fact borne out by their righteously angry polemics aimed squarely at the
 ills of modern society. By the early '90s, the band had progressed
 considerably to incorporate a slightly more rock-oriented sound, and
 signed to a major label. 1993's 'Recipe For Hate' album was originally
 released on Epitaph, but was re-released with help of Atlantic.
 The result was that Bad Religion were an 'alternative' band sitting
 happily in the mainstream. Whether this relaxation of musical demarcation
 lines was due to the grunge wave is, in a sense, irrelevant, because it
 allowed the band to reach a much wider audience without diluting the power
 of their convictions.

@node "BIOHAZARD"

 BIOHAZARD

 Tattoos, anger, lots of shouting, a wall of guitars, more tattoos, more
 shouting - if you're looking for smoochy, lighter-raising ballads and
 smooth pop rock, look away now. Because Biohazard bring the whole weight
 of modern urban decay with themselves into the studio whenever they record.
 And when we're talking about decay, we mean the roughest, most bruising
 experiences you can imagine from their formative area, Brooklyn, Noo Yoik.
 Formed back in 1988, they were driven by the social injustices they
 witnessed every day and their early sound was very similar to other
 New York hardcore stalwarts and heavily influenced by the likes of @{"Anthrax" link "ANTHRAX"}.
 However, naturally open to the sounds on the street, hip-hop gradually
 seeped into the mix and their 1990 self-titled debut found them
 experimenting gamely with their songwriting. By the time of 1992's
 indignantly enraged 'Urban Discipline', the synthesis of thrash and beats
 was virtually complete. Subsequent albums, 'State Of The World Address',
 'Mata Leao' and live album 'No Holds Barred', merely thrashed the already
 tightly honed intensity into yet more and varied permutations. It seemed
 almost impossible for the band to maintain such a ferociously focused
 attack and yet in 1999, they released possibly their most confrontational
 album yet, 'New World Disorder'. While there is injustice in the world,
 it seems that there will always be a niche for Biohazard.

@node "BLACK SABBATH"

 BLACK SABBATH

 With their roots in the heavy blues scene of the late '60s, the band that
 effectively defined heavy metal in the '70s originally rejoiced under the
 unlikely moniker of Earth. Taking their name from a horror movie based on
 a Dennis Wheatley novel, they set about making a name for themselves by
 adopting an overtly extreme (for the period) horror stance as a stark
 contrast to the hippy-drippy excesses of the '60s and early '70s.
 Guitarist Tony Iommi rapidly developed a reputation as a human riff machine
 and with the bowel-loosening rhythmic engine of bassist Geezer Butler and
 drummer Bill Ward at their core, their sound set the standard all other
 metal bands would seek to emulate. Of course, the fact that one of rock's
 original mad men, the peerless @{"Ozzy Osbourne" link "OZZY OSBOURNE"}, was on vocals gave them an
 undeniable head start and the band blazed a trail with a series of
 doom-laden classics: their eponymous debut album, 'Paranoid' (featuring
 that hit single), 'Master Of Reality', 'Volume 4', 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'
 and 'Sabotage'. In 1978, with the pressure of narcotics and success
 weighing heavily upon them, Osbourne left to pursue a solo career while
 the band continued with singer @{"Ronnie James Dio" link "DIO"} (ex-@{"Rainbow" link "RAINBOW"} and Elf).
 Sadly, the line-up fractured further until Iommi was the only original
 member at the creative helm of a number of decidedly average albums in
 the '80s and '90s. More recently, however, with hatchets firmly buried,
 the original line-up reformed to perform once again to unanimous worldwide
 acclaim.

@node "BLUE OYSTER CULT"

 BLUE OYSTER CULT

 Baffling, bombastic, beguiling - all these and many more seemingly
 incongruous qualities can be attributed to New York's Blue Oyster Cult;
 after all, who else could write songs about sex, sci-fi and Godzilla
 and make some of the most absurd lyrics sound like poetry? After a shaky
 start in 1969, sneakily began to adopt the accoutrements of mysticism
 and the occult so readily associated with them now; the chaos symbol, the
 deliberately ironic lyrics and an intentionally provocative approach to
 their artwork. Throughout the '70s, under the guidance of writer/producer
 Sandy Pearlman, the band found themselves not only admired by headbangers
 worldwide, but by anyone who appreciated their particularly arty brand
 of metal - especially anyone turned on, bizarrely, by the lyrical
 contributions of punk poetess Patti Smith who was going out with keyboard
 player Alan Lanier, a paradox that must still confuse anyone who likes
 their music easily catagorised. Without doubt, the one single song that
 catapulted to international stardom was their massive hit '(Don't Fear)
 The Reaper' which took the US by storm in 1976 and the UK charts in 1978.
 And the mid '70s was definitely their most creatively successful period,
 featuring such idiosyncratic masterpieces as 'Secret Treaties' and
 'Agents Of Fortune'. Sadly, their lucky star began to wane and the
 albums gradually became patchier through the '80s and '90s, though they
 courageously continue to play live.

@node "BODY COUNT"

 BODY COUNT

 At first it seems highly unlikely that a successful and credible hip-hop
 star such as Ice-T would dabble with the hoary old world of hard rock
 and heavy metal. After all, if everyone loves you for being (at least
 musically) the cool antithesis of cliched rock, why change? Nevertheless,
 Ice-T first met guitarist Ernie C at Crenshaw High School and continued to
 consul him whenever a vicious guitar riff was required as their respective
 musical careers got underway. As a result, Body Count officially came into
 existence in 1989 and were blowing people away on the very first
 Lollapalooza tour before they'd even recorded an album. When 'Body Count'
 emerged, it was an amazing amalgamation of thundering metal and Ice-T's
 brazen, tongue-in-cheek lyrics honed from years of the hippest hip-hop.
 As a crossover album, it was unique, but nothing could have prepared the
 band for the song that really broke them into the popular consciousness.
 While some of the tracks were just throwaways, one of the more serious
 songs provoked outrage and made it the most notorious tune to ever
 (dis)grace a record. 'Cop Killer' had the moral guardians and political
 authorities up in arms and eventually provoked the record label to remove
 the tune from the album after the band and label personnel received death
 threats. Subsequent albums 'Born Dead' and 'Violent Demise: Last Days'
 were more of the same, only without any tunes garnering the same degree
 of outrage, and the band have been relatively quiet of late.

 BON JOVI

 A strict adherent to the don't-bore-us-get-to-the-chorus school of
 songwriting, Jon Bon Jovi (a softening of family name Bongiovi) was a
 desperate individual trying to get a solo career launched in the early
 '80s. With his photogenic good looks and penchant for self-marketing,
 however, it was just a matter of time before the world took notice.
 With school pal David Bryan (keyboards) on board, they then gathered
 Richie Sambora (guitar), Alec John Such (bass) and Ticco Torres (drums)
 around them, and all the pieces were in place for international stardom.
 An eponymous debut and follow-up, '7800 °F', failed to get Bon Jovi
 anything more than a few decent reviews and a whole lot of indifference,
 but all that would change in 1986, when top producer Bruce Fairburn began
 to shape their third album with the help of some major songwriting talent,
 most notably Desmond Child whose slick tricks with lyrics and melody were
 legendary. In the decade of spandex, glitzy silk scarves and poodle perms,
 Jon had it all - and now he had the solid gold album he craved.
 'Slippery When Wet' was pure commercial dynamite - 'You Give Love A Bad
 Name', 'Livin' On A Prayer', 'Wanted Dead Or Alive' - it was packed with
 anthemic pop rock gems, and Jon was now the mythical cowboy troubadour,
 charming everyone with his stadium-filling antics. The follow-up,
 'New Jersey', proved to be yet another album in this tried-and-tested
 mould.  Inevitably, grunge took its toll on the band in the early '90s,
 and with a series of publicly reported disagreements about royalties
 between the man himself and Sambora, the band looked ready to split.
 A situation not helped by the release of Jon's soundtrack to 'Blaze Of
 Glory - Young Guns II', which contained the smash hit 'Blaze Of Glory'.
 However, Jon was nothing if not a supremely cunning businessman, and the
 band re-emerged in 1992 with 'Keep The Faith', sporting fashionably
 shorter hair cuts and a tougher, yet still hugely commercial, sound.
 Since then, band work has alternated with solo outings, and they are set
 to release 'Crush' in summer 2000.

@node "BOSTON"

 BOSTON

 This extraordinary melodic hard rock band, led by the musical perfectionist
 Tom Scholz, were one of the least prolific, yet most highly influential,
 bands of the '70s and '80s. Formed in the mid '70s by studio technician
 and multi-instrumentalist Scholz, Boston's main artistic thrust was the
 creation of perfectly crafted songs through the deployment of technology
 in the studio, and debut album 'Boston' (1976) is a testament to this
 meticulous sonic engineering. The album was brimful of solid harmonies
 and driving guitar, nowhere more apparent than on its monster smash hit
 single 'More Than A Feeling'. The effect of this melodic marvel was
 extremely far-reaching - as has been often pointed out, @{"Nirvana" link "NIRVANA"}'s 'Smell's
 Like Teen Spirit' owes just as much to that famous riff as to any number
 of obscure punk bands. The irony of the Boston situation, however, is
 that Scholz's notorious perfectionism got the better of him and while
 1978's follow-up 'Don't Look Back' was also a hit (albeit on a lesser
 scale), it took until 1986 and 'Third Stage' for the band to release
 another album. Although this record gave them the US No. 1 hit single
 'Amanda', Scholz had succeeded in alienating his band and record label
 along the way. In 1994, they got around to releasing their fourth album.
 'Walk On'. and who knows when they might release a fifth?

 from London. Formed in 1992, the line-up included Nigel Pulsford (guitar),
 Dave Parsons (bass) and Robin Goodridge (drums), and they toured and
 played the way fledgling rock bands do, without anyone taking the blindest
 bit of notice. Until an American record executive spotted their grunge
 potential, and Bush were suddenly major stars in the US within the life
 cycle of a single album. That record, 1995's 'Sixteen Stone', gave the
 band a major hit single in 'Everything Zen'. The advance radio play of
 that song alone ensured the band were well on the road to platinum sales
 long before the year was out and they made a sudden leap from playing
 clubs in London to stadiums in the US. Follow-up album 1997's 'Razorblade
 Suitcase' made the band look even more like Nirvana copyists to their
 critics as they opted to record with Steve Albini (he had recorded
 Nirvana's last album 1993's 'In Utero'), and 1999's 'The Science Of
 Things' merely emphasised the fact that when it comes to tuneful misery,
 Bush have got that vital commercial pop touch.

 CANNIBAL CORPSE

 'If you want blood - you've got it!' sang @{"AC/DC" link "AC-DC"}'s Bon Scott many years
 back and with Cannibal Corpse, you've definitely got it. Lots of it.
 Splashed all over the place. Along with brains, entrails, and a still
 pumping heart. Possibly one of the most deliberately offensive and deeply
 unpleasant death metal bands to ever commit aural butchery to tape,
 Cannibal Corpse first rose from the dead in Buffalo, New York, in 1988.
 The city's underground metal scene was humming with activity and none were
 more active than this lot who pinched the nastiest, speediest bits from
 Slayer and proceeded to add their own unique flourishes to the sound.
 As if the unadulterated brutality of the music weren't enough, the band
 revelled in the most obscenely indecipherable lyrical matter their twisted
 little minds could conjure up. Hence they penned charming little ditties
 like 'Entrails Ripped From A Virgin's Cunt', 'I Cum Blood' and 'Meathook
 Sodomy'. These playful tunes could be found on albums such as debut
 'Eaten Back To Life', 1991's 'Butchered At Birth' and 1992's catchily
 titled 'Tomb Of The Mutilated'. Not happy with just aural violence,
 the sleeve artwork also featured all manner of hideous splatter and gore,
 which inevitably resulted in various albums being banned from major
 retailing chains. Naturally, a cult following was inevitable with
 successive albums and, bizarrely, they can even be seen as a club band
 in the Jim Carrey comedy 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'!

@node "CARCASS"

 CARCASS

 A suitably graphic name for a seriously graphic band. In terms of extreme
 music, Carcass were pioneers in the thrash sub-genre known as grindcore,
 a style developed from the short, sharp shocks churned out by the likes
 of Napalm Death, topped off by larynx-ripping guttural roars. In fact,
 the band shared guitarist Bill Steer with Napalm Death until their third
 album, when he became singly devoted to the cause of hardcore gore.
 In terms of subject matter, all they needed to do was raid a medical
 textbook for some of the most stomach-churning imagery imaginable,
 absolutely guaranteed to get your bile rising with its technically precise
 terminology. As for their artwork - well, that concentrated on ironic
 splatter too, and graced such gloriously grotesque outings as their 1988
 debut 'Reek Of Putrefaction', follow-up 1989's 'Symphonies Of Sickness'
 and 1991's absurdly twisted 'Necrotism: Descanting The Insalubrious'.
 Sitting proudly on these albums, the avid gore freak would find such
 tender-hearted singalongs as 'Excoriating Abdominal Emanation',
 'Crepitating Bowel Erosion', and the catchily named 'Cadaveric Incubator
 Of Endo-Parasites'. Gradually the band began to move away from outright
 brutality and introduced such radical concepts as melody and accessibility.
 Unfortunately, this shift in ideals signalled that the end was in sight
 and founding member Steer departed after 1996's 'Swansong' album.

 CATHEDRAL

 Napalm Death isn't exactly the type of band one would expect to figure in
 the formation of the UK's foremost doom 'n' stoner outfit. Nevertheless
 when vocalist Lee Dorrian formed Napalm Death he always nurtured a love
 of stoned-out riffs and monster flares, and it was this infatuation with
 all things tackily 70s that motivated the man to create Cathedral in 1990.
 'Forest Of Equilibrium' was their fine debut of 1991 and proved to be
 a cornucopia of fantasy and sci-fi inspired lyricism nailed down by
 a knowing sense of gloomy rhythm and a healthy dose of self-deprecating
 irony. Follow-ups, 1993's 'The Ethereal Mirror' and 1995's 'The Carnival
 Bizarre' - along with some fine EPs and singles - placed them firmly at
 the top of the doom heap, with Dorrian's lyrical obsessions knowing no
 bounds, encompassing everything from black magic to a love of Hammer
 horror movies. With 1996's 'Supernatural Birth Machine' and 1998's
 'Caravan Beyond Redemption' the band's previously Sabbath-esque sound
 had evolved to include everything from splashes of heavy funk to -
 bizarrely - disco death. Quite extraordinary.

 CELTIC FROST

 Not many thrash outfits of the mid '80s could claim to be particularly
 innovative when it came to musical direction, but for Swiss outfit Celtic
 Frost, led by the enigmatic Tom G Warrior, invention was the very life
 blood of creation. Formed in 1984 from the wreckage of the distinctly below
 average Hellhammer, Celtic Frost would go on to become something of both
 a commercial and critical success. At first, they adopted a fairly standard
 studs 'n' leather stance, completed with some judicious application of
 make-up, for 'Morbid Tales'. Warrior deployed his famous death grunts to
 terrific effect and the songs were suitably gothic while possessing all
 the chaotic energy of thrash. Follow-up 'To Mega Therion' contained further
 stabs into art rock territory, but with 1987's 'Into The Pandemonium',
 Warrior and his cohorts had created something unique. There were sections
 of poetry present alongside orchestration, Eastern prayer chants and,
 even more bizarrely, rap! This was imagination run riot - not bad going
 for a band that had started off in the mould of Slayer. Unfortunately,
 1988's 'Cold Lake' went for a more mainstream glam style sound, which
 alienated many of their fans, so when they reverted to type with
 'Vanity/Nemesis', the damage had already been done and they split
 a little while later. Most recently, Tom Fischer (Warrior's real name)
 has masterminded the creation of cyber-metallers Apollyon Sun.

 CHEAP TRICK

 Bands with even a fraction of Cheap Trick's style and intelligence are,
 sadly, extremely thin on the ground. This four-piece from the appropriately
 named Rockford, Illinois, first emerged in the mid '70s and at the pinnacle
 of their success were admired just as much by devout fans as by other
 musicians.  With an image that was equal parts sex appeal (vocalist Robin
 Zander and bassist Tom Petersson) and court jester (drummer Bun E Carlos
 and guitarist Rick Nielsen), these lads brought both humour and style to
 their music - an aspect personified by the madcap Nielsen in his trademark
 goofy jumpers, bow tie and baseball cap. Naturally, this would all be as
 nothing were it not for some marvellously hooky hard-rocking albums;
 in particular, 1977's 'In Color', and '78's 'Heaven Tonight'.
 Of particular note was their glorious gig document 'Live At Budokan',
 where all the seemingly disparate elements of the Trick combined to
 staggering effect. In the '80s, the band were, unfortunately, less
 successful and, somewhat ironically, it took a bunch of outside songwriters
 to give them some commercial clout again with 1988's super-smooth
 'Lap Of Luxury' and their first ever US No. 1 'The Flame'. Since then,
 it fair to say that, though the band have bravely continued, they seem
 to be merely treading creative water.

 CINDERELLA

 More glam than an explosion in a glitter factory, with a name like
 Cinderella you knew exactly what you were going to get with this good-time
 party outfit. Formed in 1984 and led by vocalist/guitarist Tom Keiffer
 this four-piece put in many a sweaty night in the bars and clubs of
 Philadelphia before being championed by one @{"Jon Bon Jovi" link "BON JOVI"}. At this point
 precisely the band became dead certs in the big-haired 80s and debut album
 'Night Songs' (1986) was a quintessential product of the times. It took
 the trash ethics of @{"Motley Crue" link "MOTLEY CRUE"} gave them an @{"AC/DC" link "AC-DC"} twist and, with the
 likes of MTV hit 'Shake Me', lit the blue touch paper. They were loud,
 raucous and the perfect tour accompaniment for the likes of @{"David Lee Roth" link "DAVID LEE ROTH"}
 and Bon Jovi. Follow-up 1988's 'Long Cold Winter' showed a greater
 diversity and it was this desire to move away from pop metal that
 ironically converted the critics but lost them their fans, who obviously
 loved the no-brain rockers more than their carefully wrought third album
 'Heartbreak Station'. The band were now going for a more flexible, bluesy,
 Rolling Stones sound which obviously baffled anyone who simply wanted to
 get their rocks off. Since then Cinderella have faded considerably with
 only 1994's 'Still Climbing' a solid reminder of their 80s glory days.

 COAL CHAMBER

 Edgy, disturbing, bizarre - just a few of the many, and valid, ways of
 describing LA angst-fiends Coal Chamber. Formed in 1994 by Dez Fafara
 (vocals) and Miguel 'Meegs' Rascon (guitar), who met by answering
 a classified ad, they added Mike Cox (drums) and Rayna Foss (bass) before
 building up a reputation for impassioned and cathartic live shows at venues
 such as the Roxy and Whiskey A-Go-Go. Their demo tape also garnered a great
 deal of interest, not least because it was championed by @{"Fear Factory" link "FEAR FACTORY"}'s
 Dino Cazares. When their eponymous 1997 debut emerged, it finally became
 clear why Coal Chamber had struck a nerve with such accuracy. The record
 was by turns spiteful, angry and fearlessly innovative - it also contained
 a major alternative hit in 'Loco'. It borrowed the grungy downtuned fire of
 acts such as @{"Korn" link "KORN"}, threw in some cool hip-hop influenced rhythmic twists,
 all finished off with Fafara's decidedly unique vocals. This was the sound
 of trauma committed to tape. It was also very, very heavy indeed. Always
 keen to remain industrious, the band then toured for what seemed like an
 age before returning with 'Chamber Music' (1999), and a direction that
 adopted a more arty, gothic feel to their already fearsome sound.

 CORROSION OF CONFORMITY

 A very apt name for a band who perform with such ingrained integrity,
 Corrosion Of Conformity have actually been working their way towards
 a heavy 'stoner' style vibe ever since their inception as a hardcore band
 back in the very early 80s. Back then founding member, guitarist Woody
 Weatherman created a band intent on delivering the hardest, toughest
 politically charged polemic they could, but the band's sound was never
 quite satisfactory even though albums such as 'Animosity' and 'Technocracy'
 still sound solid today. It took the addition of New Orleans-raised
 Pepper Keenan (guitar/vocals) and his unique musical voice to give COC the
 necessary push into a new creative direction. COC didn't exactly become
 a 'stoner' band as such - not for them the flares and unequivocal love of
 all things 70s - rather they adopted the sludgey, fuzzy power of, say,
 @{"Black Sabbath" link "BLACK SABBATH"} but twisted it to a very 90s template with albums such as
 'Blind', 'Deliverance' and, their real breakthrough record, 1996's
 devastatingly powerful 'Wiseblood'. With it came COC's jump up into the
 general rock consciousness and the band enjoyed major exposure supporting
 the likes of @{"Metallica" link "METALLICA"} on their 'Load' world tour. Since then things have
 become relatively quiet, though Keenan's love of 'timeless' rock can also
 be sampled on 'Down', a project which also included @{"Pantera" link "PANTERA"}'s Phil Anselmo.

 CRADLE OF FILTH

 When it comes to the blackest of black metal the UK's Cradle Of Filth
 could give some of the nastiest Scandinavian outfits a real run for their
 money.  Formed in 1991, in Ipswich, the one constant feature of the band
 throughout a series of personnel changes is the guiding leadership of
 vocalist Dani Filth. With his eardrum-savaging vocal style - somewhere
 between a cat's screech and a terrier's yap - Filth has shaped the
 direction the band has taken right from their first forays into gothic
 thrash right up to their latest conceptual album, 1998's 'Cruelty And
 The Beast'. In the interim the band have released such dark delights
 as mini-LP 'Vempire Or Dark Faerytales In Phallustein' and the album
 'Dusk & Her Embrace'. In building up to 'Cruelty...' - surely some kind
 of artistic pinnacle for the genre - the band have developed from overt
 thrash roots to incorporating a more considered and deliberately arty
 orchestral approach to their tales of satanic debauchery. In particular,
 they have taken the hitherto underground goth vampire image and given the
 myth a commercial twist by adopting the look themselves for the fashion
 conscious 90s, and in the process spawned a whole slew of imitators.
 Not only that, but Filth's literary tastes have given the band a definite
 edge when it comes to lyrics and concepts; some of the wordplay may be
 self-consciously painful but it has ensured that Cradle Of Filth are
 streets ahead of the competition.

 CRO-MAGS

 When hardcore was emerging from the underground back in the early '80s,
 New York's Cro-Mags were one of the main outfits that exemplified the
 tight, brutal noise of righteous indignation and championed a positive
 personal philosophy. Not that you'd think it to look at them. Lots of
 tattoos, fists and plenty of macho shouting - while hardcore provided
 the key to their modest success, it was the incorporation of elements
 of thrash metal that really launched them as influential movers and
 shakers. Two members that will forever be connected not only with the
 Cro-Mags - incidentally, that's short for Cro-Magnon man - but to the
 hardcore scene in general, were bassist/bandleader Harley Flanagan and
 lead singer/shouter John 'Bloodclot' Joseph. What's more, they were
 members of the Hare Krishna sect; hence the spiritual positivism espoused
 in many of the songs. When debut album 'The Age Of Quarrel' was released
 in 1986, the band had in one fell swoop established an uncompromising
 identity for themselves, but, unfortunately, the line-up was very volatile
 and so failed to maintain momentum for any meaningful length of time,
 although 'Best Wishes' did follow three years later. Work eventually began
 on 'Alpha-Omega', but it took a split and reformation before it was finally
 finished for release in 1992. In the end, 1993's 'Near Death Experience'
 proved to be the band's swansong as the various members effectively fell
 out with each other for the last time.

 Originally the frontman for cartoon gore-hounds the @{"Misfits" link "MISFITS"} (the same lot
 that so influenced @{"Metallica" link "METALLICA"} in their early years), Glenn Danzig had first
 spent some time as the force behind Samhain before launching his own
 eponymous rock band. Eschewing the schlocky hardcore noise of his
 formative years, Danzig instead opted for a more basic blues thunder,
 and with his muscular frame and rich crooning vocals came across very much
 as a kind of demonic Elvis figure, both on stage and on record. With a band
 consisting of Eerie Von (bass), John Christ (guitar) and Chuck Biscuits
 (drums), Danzig created the dark menace of his self-titled debut album,
 a cross between gothic horror and hard-rocking blues. Refining the Satanic
 horror schtick for album number two, 'Danzig II: Lucifuge', it was finally
 with 'Danzing III: How The Gods Kill' that all the elements of melody,
 primal power and raw emotion finally coalesced in a truly satisfactory way.
 Subsequent releases - 'Danzig IV', 'Danzig 5: Blackacidevil' and 'Danzig
 6:66 Satan's Child' - have found him moving towards more of
 a spine-tingling industrial sound to complement his icy blues howl.
 A chillingly influential and uncompromising artist.

 to the point, just how to dish it up. Fronting one of the biggest rock
 bands in the world, the awesome @{"Van Halen" link "VAN HALEN"}, had taught him a thing or two
 over the years, so when he went solo in 1985 with his 'Crazy From The
 Heat' EP, he just concentrated on what he knew best - entertainment -
 delivering fun and glitz in vaudeville and Broadway fashion. His style,
 best typified by 1986's gloriously dynamic 'Eat 'Em And Smile' album,
 was so colourful many people thought he would long outshine his former
 bandmates. He had the charisma and the wit, he looked and sounded
 fantastic, and he didn't care who knew it! With the phenomenal guitar
 talents of @{"Steve Vai" link "STEVE VAI"} at his side, he turned out yet another magical set
 of tunes in 1988's 'Skyscraper', all dazzling fretwork and big, bold,
 chest-beating choruses. Sadly, however, though the records were solid

 DEATH

 The name says it all really. Formed back in 1983, the architect of the
 Death sound was one Chuck Schuldiner who, over the years to come, would
 prove to be the single constant member of the band, often referred to as
 a dictator surrounded by hired hands. Formed at the inception of the
 thrash metal genre, Death marked themselves out as unique by being the
 most single-mindedly intense outfit in the violence stakes.
 The concentration on all things deathly eventually led to the coining
 of the 'death metal' sub-genre and, although it took them four years to
 release an album - they built their reputation solely through brutal live
 performances and a series of underground tapes - when 'Scream Bloody Gore'
 finally emerged in 1987, Schuldiner and co had created something of a
 thrash masterpiece. Subsequent albums concentrated on the same bloody
 template with the playing gradually becoming increasingly refined and
 relatively technical, until, by the time 'Individual Thought Patterns'
 was released in 1993, the band had actually embraced melody. Well, sort
 of. Definitely an outfit hard to beat in terms of outright, relentless
 thrash, they never made the same commercial impact as some of their peers,
 but remained underground heroes of the genre.

 DEEP PURPLE

 Yes, that guitar riff! Right up there with @{"Led Zep's" link "LED ZEPPELIN"} 'Stairway To Heaven',
 possibly the most mangled song in rock history and favourite of sad musos
 who hang out in guitar shops - the immortal 'Smoke On The Water'.
 The initial Mark I Deep Purple line-up - featuring legendary guitarist
 Ritchie Blackmore and keyboard player Jon Lord - created three rather
 dated-sounding albums in the late '60s, but this period did give them
 another live favourite in their cover of Joe South's 'Hush'. The Mark II
 line-up - featuring the golden larynx of Ian Gillan - was quite spectacular
 by comparison and turned out consistently superb albums such as 'In Rock',
 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head' (home to the classic 'Smoke On The Water').
 Blackmore's frenetic guitar style was perfectly complemented by both Lord's
 massive washes of Hammond organ and Gillan's piercing operatic voice.
 However, even as the band were rapidly becoming one of the hottest acts
 in the world with their powerful bluesy brand of rock, internal friction
 - often blamed on 'moody' Blackmore - had them foundering. Hence the first
 Mark III album to feature David Coverdale (vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass)
 was 1974's magnificent 'Burn'. But Blackmore was still not happy and so
 left to be replaced by the mercurial guitar talent of Tommy Bolin for just
 one Mark IV studio album, 'Come Taste The Band' (1975). Sadly, the band
 very soon after imploded and Bolin died of a heroin overdose. From this
 mess, of course, such phenomenal outfits as @{"Whitesnake" link "WHITESNAKE"} and @{"Rainbow" link "RAINBOW"} were
 born, but the Purple were not completely dead yet. The fan clamour for
 the band to reform grew year on year until the Mark II line-up could resist
 no longer and 1984 brought 'Perfect Strangers'. Though subsequent years
 have resulted in albums and tours of varying quality, the line-up has
 shifted several times since and now features Steve Morse on guitar.

 DEF LEPPARD

 One of the few bands to truly epitomise the MTV-friendly style of stadium
 rock of the '80s, Sheffield's Def Leppard are one of the biggest bands of
 the last twenty years and though their star faded somewhat in the early
 '90s, their current return to hard-rocking form bodes well for the future.
 Starting out in 1977 as Atomic Mass, and influenced by the likes of @{"Queen" link "QUEEN"}
 and Mott The Hoople, the band famously used a disused spoon factory for
 rehearsals as they developed their sound, finalised their line-up and
 changed their name to a more familiar Deaf Leopard. With the now classic
 'Getcha Rocks Off' EP, the band suddenly found themselves catapulted to
 the forefront of the burgeoning New Wave Of British Heavy Metal.
 A quickly recorded debut, 'On Through The Night' (1980), with @{"Judas Priest" link "JUDAS PRIEST"}
 producer Tom Allom, captured the band's sparky youth perfectly and landed
 them US support slots with the likes of Priest and @{"Ted Nugent" link "TED NUGENT"}. This
 apparent defection to the States irritated many of their early fans, but
 the Leps made their first foray into MTV with 'Bringin' On The Heartbreak'
 from the Mutt Lange produced album 'High 'N' Dry'. Lange's production work
 was still relatively unknown, but his obvious skill with a commercial sound
 helped to give the Leps their big break which came, finally, with another
 Lange collaboration, 'Pyromania', a world-conquering smash in 1983.
 With its slick production, massive singalong choruses and keen ear for
 commerciality, 'Pyromania' broke the band to a worldwide audience, but
 disaster was to keep them from releasing a follow-up for four years. First,
 pre-production work with producer Jim Steinman worked out badly and then
 a real catastrophe occurred, when drummer Rick Allen was involved in an
 horrific car accident which severed his left arm. Allen, nevertheless,
 remained in the band, playing his part on a synthesised drum kit operated
 mainly by pedals. When 'Hysteria' was finally released in 1987, the band
 had truly entered the superleague, only to be almost thwarted again when
 guitarist Steve 'Steamin'' Clark was found dead in early 1991 from a lethal
 cocktail of pills and alcohol. His replacement was veteran six-stringer
 Vivian Campbell. 1992's 'Adrenalize' was their last great album in terms
 of profile as the nascent grunge scene overshadowed the Leps and many
 of their peers. After a couple of less notable recent efforts, 1999's
 'Euphoria' marked a return to their classic melodic sound.

 and hardcore to create a truly unique sound which was not only extremely

 was very aptly titled and contained blast after blast of carefully honed
 noise. Their obvious proficiency in the studio was enhanced by a reputation
 for enormously energetic live shows, with singer Moreno literally throwing
 himself bodily into each performance with such fearless abandon he was in

 Any thrash fans out there who feel that @{"Venom" link "VENOM"} are a bunch of pansies or
 that @{"Slayer" link "SLAYER"} are just a little too soft these days ought to try Deicide on
 for size. Formed back in 1987 as part of the ever-growing Florida death
 metal scene Deicide were a bunch who walked it just like they talked it.
 Taking the early cartoon Satanism of bands like Venom to new extremes,
 band leader, bassist and vocalist Glenn Benton set about creating one of
 the most brutally unpleasant thrash bands currently upsetting sensitive
 people in the world today. It wasn't enough just to throw a few infernal
 images around the place or to have your picture taken surrounded by skulls
 and pentagrams, you actually had to be in league with the horned one
 downstairs. Hence, Benton took to branding an inverted cross on his
 forehead and claimed he and his band were genuine, blood-drinking,
 virgin-sacrificing Satanists. His real media coup came in 1992 when he
 claimed to torture animals as well, which resulted in all sorts of threats
 from enraged animals rights groups. Still, however dubious some of the
 man's claims may have been, when it came to the music, Deicide were very
 much a unique prospect, as can be witnessed on their 1990 self-titled
 debut. They were fast, very fast. And savage. And downright nasty.
 All qualities which were sharpened on subsequent releases, such as
 'Legion' and 'Once Upon The Cross'. Although all the albums featured
 graphic Christian-baiting imagery, the latter had one of their most
 extreme sleeves: a picture of a crucified Christ on an autopsy table.
 The only thing that may stop Deicide from pursuing their deranged campaign
 against decency is death, although even that is unlikely - Benton claimed
 he wanted to be dead by the time he was 33. He's now past that age, and
 the band just keep on going.

 DIAMOND HEAD

 Some bands are destined to be huge on the world stage, and some end up
 providing the inspirational fuel to get them there. Diamond Head would
 appear to fall into the latter category. They never sold millions of
 records, they never embarked on worldwide sold-out live tours, but their
 ferociously original style of metal was to influence some of the biggest
 bands currently playing today and as such, demand some serious
 investigation. The original line-up of Sean Harris (vocals), Brian Tatler
 (guitar), Colin Kimberly (bass) and Duncan Scott (drums) originally met at
 school in the mid '70s. Through a series of classic live shows and
 independently produced and solid releases, they rapidly became national
 rock heroes. Early singles included highly collectible masterpieces such
 as 'Shoot Out The Lights/Helpless' and 'Sweet And Innocent/Streets Of
 Gold', and their first album was a white label promo effort called
 'Lightning To The Nations'. In their brashness, they even once famously
 compared themselves to the mighty @{"Led Zeppelin" link "LED ZEPPELIN"}, but their boldness was
 well justified, what with Tatler's gargantuan guitar talent and Harris'
 awesome lung power, they were naturals in the New Wave Of British Heavy
 Metal. Having signed to MCA, however, things began to go a little
 pear-shaped. The label didn't really know how to manage them and their
 first 'proper' album, 'Borrowed Time', took too long to release, while
 other bands such as @{"Iron Maiden" link "IRON MAIDEN"} already had a headstart on them.
 New album 'Canterbury' followed in 1983 and was some way distant from
 their metal beginnings. That and a poor performance at the Donington
 Monsters Of Rock Festival didn't help. Sadly, it all went downhill
 thereafter, and the band were dropped by MCA and split in 1985. In the

 DIO

 The little man with the big, big voice, singer Ronnie James Dio is,
 ironically, one of the biggest players in the world of metal. His lengthy
 career stretches back into the '60s, but his first real taste of success
 came fronting the preposterously monikered Electric Elves, later sensibly
 shortened to the more economical Elf. His major break came in fronting
 Ritchie Blackmore's @{"Rainbow" link "RAINBOW"} in the '70s, where his soaring operatic voice
 and penchant for ridiculously overwrought lyrics, usually including
 references to rock 'n' roll children and rainbows, began to develop with
 a vengeance. Having filled in for a departed @{"Ozzy Osbourne" link "OZZY OSBOURNE"} in @{"Black Sabbath" link "BLACK SABBATH"}
 (in the late '70s), he went on to form a metal outfit in his own image,
 a band that would actually commercially outstrip Iommi and cohorts in the
 '80s. Much of Dio's success can be laid not only at Ronnie's door, but the
 magnificent musicians he surrounded himself with. Guitarist Vivian Campbell
 was responsible for some of the crunchiest riffage this side of
 @{"Judas Priest" link "JUDAS PRIEST"}'s Glenn Tipton, and the powerful metal stance of albums
 such as 'Holy Diver' (1983) and 'The Last In Line' (1984), topped off
 by Ronnie's huge voice, are classics of the genre. Unfortunately, the
 mainman's constant dabbling with ludicrous fantasy lyrics and absurd
 stage shows (where he fought giant dragons!) made him look increasingly
 dated and he actually rejoined Black Sabbath for the dull 'Dehumanizer'
 album in 1992. Subsequent albums have been patchy at best, but his latest
 effort 'Magica' has been hailed as some sort of return to form.

 ELP

 Or Emerson, Lake and Palmer - a trio of super-talented musos who came damn
 close to making the prog rock genre their own in the '70s. The band was
 a supergroup when it first formed: keyboard player Keith Emerson (ex-Nice),
 vocalist/bassist/guitarist Greg Lake (ex-King Crimson) and drummer Carl
 Palmer (ex-Atomic Rooster). And when they hit the 1970 Isle Of Wight
 Festival amid exploding cannons, a bombastic musical legend was born.
 Largely known for incorporating classical leanings into their overblown
 prog mayhem - all parping keyboards and seemingly endless compositions
 - large scale success came in the form of 1971's 'Tarkus', an unlikely and
 gloriously mad concept work about a battle between a manticore and a giant
 robot armadillo no, really! Just goes to show what crazy things you could
 get away with when immersing yourself in the heady waters of prog rock.
 More synthesisers and overwrought arrangements followed in its wake with
 the major success of 'Pictures At An Exhibition' and 'Trilogy'. 1977 saw
 the band enjoy one of their biggest hit singles in their inspired cover
 of Aaron Copeland's 'Fanfare For The Common Man'. With punk a burgeoning
 movement and their ill-advised attempt at a pop album (1978's 'Love
 Beach'), their success gradually began to wane and they split until a
 slight comeback in the early '90s where they performed three hugely
 successful shows at London's Royal Albert Hall and recorded 'Black Moon'
 (1992).

 EMPEROR

 Purveyors of the blackest in black metal, Norway's Emperor were always
 guaranteed a place in metal's hall of infamy. Not only were the band -
 featuring long-standing founding member vocalist/guitarist/keyboardist
 Ihsahn - steeped in the traditions of thrash metal, but they brought
 a whole new dimension to the genre through a desire for musical innovation
 hitherto unconnected with metal. Not only was the music malevolently dark
 and blisteringly fast, but it featured a major interest in the brooding
 majesty of Norwegian folk music and the sombre shadings of classical
 traditions. The resulting gothic thunder enhanced the satanic horror of
 the lyrics to terrific effect, a sound which immediately garnered a major
 cult following upon the release of 1994's 'In The Nightside Eclipse' and
 which has subsequently been developed on 1997's 'Anthems To The Welkin At
 Dusk' and most recently, on 1999's 'IX Equilibrium'. Unfortunately, the
 band were not only noted for their musical experimentation, but also for
 their overtly anti-Christian sentiments, which spilled over into various
 criminal deeds, including acts of violence and arson on churches.
 The various members' apparent inability to rein in the worst excesses of
 violence eventually led to a fatal stabbing incident and the subsequent
 conviction of drummer Faust.

 Big hair and teeth - lots of shiny white teeth! - and girls swooning all
 over the front row. Yes, indeed, Europe singer Joey Tempest must be in the
 house. For a band that won a national rock competition in their native
 Sweden, they have come a very, very long way indeed. Officially formed
 in 1982, their prize was a recording contract and, boy, did they capitalise
 on the chance they'd been given. A self-titled debut was recorded and duly
 exploded into Sweden's Top 10. With an Epic record deal, 1985 brought
 'Wings Of Tomorrow', a sound- and image-friendly record. But it was
 1986 that saw their finest hour - well, four minutes or so, actually.
 'The Final Countdown' was yet another lush and smooth-sounding rock album,
 but nestling in its oh-so-wholesome grooves was the smash hit title track,
 featuring a huge drum sound and an even huger, parptastic keyboard refrain.
 And then, of course, there was the charismatically anodyne Joey Tempest
 and his lovely perm. In a pop rock climate that had catapulted @{"Bon Jovi" link "BON JOVI"}
 heavenward, how could such a soft-rocking gem fail? The album went triple
 platinum and then some. Sadly, with such meteoric success, the danger is
 of not being able to repeat the feat and Europe fell victim to it with

 The success of Extreme in the early '90s can pretty much be attributed to

 @{"Queen" link "QUEEN"} pretensions to the fore, but were going nowhere until Bettencourt
 showed up in 1986 and 'Play With Me' ended up on the 'Bill And Ted's
 Excellent Adventure' soundtrack. With 1991's 'Pornograffitti', however,
 things began to take off with real momentum. 'Get The Funk Out' was a
 cheerfully cheeky @{"Red Hot Chili Peppers" link "RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS"} rip-off that smoothed off any
 rough edges to form a squeaky clean radio-friendly sound and killer chorus.
 It was with the super-smoochy ballad 'More Than Words', however, that their
 fate was sealed as MTV faves to mothers and daughters alike. In 1992, they
 wore their influences literally on their sleeves when they turned in a
 staggering performance at the Freddie Mercury Tribute concert at Wembley
 Stadium and then released 'III Sides To Every Story'. A new single 'Tragic
 Comic' was a less resounding hit and then things started to slide with
 'Waiting For The Punchline' (1995). Since then, lead vocalist Gary Cherone
 turned up as replacement to Sammy Hagar with Eddie and co. for '@{"Van Halen" link "VAN HALEN"}

 FAITH NO MORE

 True originals are few and far between in the world of rock; some bands
 find their niche as fine imitators of their heroes, others pioneer a whole
 new sound and experience. Faith No More definitely fit into the latter
 category. Not many bands would dare to cover both Bee Gees and Dead
 Kennedys songs, dabble in death metal and funk, and still make it all
 sound seamless and natural. Formed in San Francisco in the early '80s,
 the original Chuck Moseley-fronted incarnation of the band came to
 prominence with the cataclysmically catchy funk rap of 'We Care A Lot',
 a rehashing of a tune from their eponymous 1985 debut. The ironically
 titled follow-up, 'Introduce Yourself', was just as much a peculiarly
 eclectic mish-mash of styles, as much a product of keyboardist Roddy
 Bottum's lush playing as, say, guitarist 'Big Sick Ugly' Jim Martin's
 penchant for @{"Black Sabbath" link "BLACK SABBATH"}. It was with a new singer, however - the
 scatalogically porn-fixated Mike Patton - that they truly blossomed.
 He could sing everything from rap to cod-metal opera, and the band simply
 erupted musically in all directions with the awesome commerciality of
 'The Real Thing', and the menacingly dark masterpiece 'Angel Dust'.
 The hit single cover version of the Commodores' 'I'm Easy' sealed their
 fate as one of the most perversely unique rock acts of the '90s, while
 'King For A Day - Fool for A Lifetime' and the diversely accomplished
 'Album Of The Year' kept defying expectations. In the end, though, the
 band fizzled out, due to lack of commitment from various members, leaving

 FEAR FACTORY

 Call them cyber-metal, call them industrial metal, call them just plain
 old heavy metal - LA's Fear Factory are all these things and more, their
 innovative stance and sound going some way toward influencing the current
 crop of so called nu-metal bands. Formed in 1990, the aim behind Fear
 Factory was to take the basic sound of death metal and introduce the icy
 precision of industrial and electronic textures to counterpoint the band's
 enduring fascination with technology and man's relationship to it.
 Arguably, the main creative force lay with guitarist Dino Cazares and
 vocalist Burton C Bell, who put together both the brutal music and the
 chillingly bleak lyrics between them. The result of this unique artistic
 vision was 1992's 'Soul Of A New Machine', a pummeling and intense journey
 through some very dark musical noisescapes. In order to show that they were
 interested in the creative impetus provided by new technology, they allowed
 some of the tracks to be remixed for 1993's 'Fear Is The Mind Killer'. This
 experiment put them at the forefront of metal's crossover with less guitar
 based styles of music and encouraged other bands to be equally open-minded
 about their music. This pattern was repeated for 1995's 'Demanufacture',
 which was remixed into 'Remanufacture (Cloning Technology)' a couple of
 years later by a number of notable techno-oriented artists. Never ones to
 stretch themselves in terms of work rate, Fear Factory also found time to
 dabble with a number of side-projects before returning to their cyber
 manifesto with the conceptual sci-fi of 1999's 'Obsolete'.

 It is virtually impossible to categorise the diverse and powerful sound of
 Filter, a fact that is all the more fascinating when one considers that the
 band is actually the vehicle for just one man to exercise his own unique
 artistic vision. Multi-instrumentalist and programmer Richard Patrick was
 originally a member of the touring incarnation of @{"Nine Inch Nails" link "NINE INCH NAILS"} back
 in the early 90s and as such was obviously immersed in the sounds of
 industrial and dance-based music, as well as the profound possibilities
 technology held for the aspiring musician. The first Filter record, 1995's
 'Short Bus', also featured the talents of a like-minded musical adventurer
 in Brian Liesegang. The remarkable thing about 'Short Bus' was that, true
 to the ethic that technology could free up creativity, it was recorded in
 a small house rather than an expensive studio, and its expansive
 soundscapes and energy are the direct product of just two people's musical
 imaginations. The record became a hit thanks to the alternative radio
 single 'Hey Man, Nice Shot' and, though Liesegang left in 1997, Patrick
 continued to pursue the Filter ethic with the mindstretching moods and
 textures of 'Title Of Record'.

 FOO FIGHTERS

 What the hell is a Foo Fighter? It's apparently the name given to
 mysterious UFO-like lights spotted by US air force pilots during World
 War II. And also the clever name adopted by ex-@{"Nirvana" link "NIRVANA"} drummer Dave Grohl
 for the outfit he formed in the wake of Kurt Cobain's suicide in early
 1994. Grohl had always nurtured a latent musical talent away from his
 customary drumkit, and a low-key example of his songwriting can be sampled
 as the b-side to Nirvana's penultimate single 'Heart Shaped Box'.
 'Marigold' may be unspectacular, but was indicative of a talent waiting
 to blossom, and blossom it did with the Foo Fighters' self-titled debut
 in 1995. Comparisons with his former band were inevitable, and some
 dismissed his work as Nirvana lite, but in its headlong rush of melodic
 power pop, it was so much more life-affirming than Nirvana's introspective
 musings. This was perfectly evident with the storming single 'This Is A
 Call', all blistering riffs, cryptic lyrics and a huge chorus. Follow-up
 album, 'The Colour And The Shape' (1997), proved that the first album had
 been no fluke. More of a band effort, rather than Grohl working through
 demos, the pop hardcore of the debut had metamorphosed into a diverse and
 immensely satisfying soundscape. Since then, Grohl has dabbled in several
 side-projects - composing music for films for some of the time - but the
 Foo Fighters returned in late 1999 with another powerful album, 'There
 Is Nothing Left To Lose'.

 FOREIGNER

 If you want big ballads, then Foreigner are the band for you. But that
 really is only half the story, because this superlative bunch of musicians
 are not only responsible for getting those lighters waving and the radio
 playing in slick AOR fashion, they could also kick out some seriously
 belting rock tunes when the mood took them. Formed back in 1976, rock
 veteran guitarist Mick Jones recruited some seriously talented individuals
 in Ian McDonald (multi-instrumentalist), Dennis Elliott (drums),
 Ed Gagliardi (bass), Al Greenwood (keyboards), and last, but definitely
 not least, Lou Gramm (vocals). In Gramm, the band had a singer of immense
 skill and flexibility, the kind of larynx technician who could do justice
 to both the softest ballad and the grittiest rocker. So, following in the
 bluesy tradition of outfits such as @{"Bad Company" link "BAD COMPANY"}, the band took melody to
 their hearts and polished it to the point where radio stations the world
 over couldn't resist them. The late '70s brought hits both in the UK and
 the States, but it was always in America that they found their sound to be
 best appreciated. However, it was with production whizz Mutt Lange at the
 helm of 1981's '4' that the band went stratospheric. The hits flowed
 easily, most notably 'Waiting For a Girl Like You', a huge radio single.
 1984's 'Agent Provocateur' went seriously for the heavily keyboard-oriented
 rock sound of the mid '80s and spawned another mega-hit with 'I Want To
 Know What Love Is'. Love 'em or loathe 'em, you couldn't escape 'em!
 This was undoubtedly Foreigner's glory period and subsequent albums and
 incarnations of the band have been markedly less successful, with only a
 recent 'best of' album, featuring a few new songs, being of major interest.

 This stunning blues rock outfit may only have been in existence for five
 years, but during that time, they carved out a body of authentically
 passionate work that still sounds fresh and convincing today. Formed back
 in 1968, the classic line-up consisted of Paul Rodgers (vocals), Paul
 Kossoff (guitar), Andy Fraser (bass) and Simon Kirke (drums).
 Blues veteran Alexis Korner suggested they adopt the name Free and they
 wisely fended off an attempt by their label (Island) to rename them,
 believe it or not, The Heavy Metal Kids - a suggestion presumably down to
 the fact that they were still teenagers at the time. The late '60s rock
 scene was still heavily influenced by the blues and 1968's 'Tons Of Sobs'
 revelled in the sound, with Rodgers, in particular, developing a rich and
 soulful style. With the follow-up, 1969's 'Free', Rodgers and Fraser were
 becoming something of a writing superteam, and by the time of their third
 album, 1970's 'Fire And Water', they had come up with their most enduring
 song to date, the raw romp of 'All Right Now' - amazingly a UK hit five
 times in three different decades - making them household names the world
 over. The summer of 1970 saw them at the peak of their powers and playing
 to over half a million herbally relaxed punters at the Isle Of Wight
 Festival. As ever, the high couldn't last and internal friction was
 exacerbated by the relative failure of 'Highway', their second album
 of 1970. At this point, the band split and then reformed briefly in '72,
 but the magic was long gone.

 But in reality, the outfit was the brainchild of @{"The Smashing Pumpkins" link "THE SMASHING PUMPKINS"},
 Sonic Youth and @{"Nirvana" link "NIRVANA"} producer Butch Vig and a couple of other
 knob-twiddling cohorts who were fed up by their behind-the-desk personas

 a number of false starts with various groups over the preceding years,
 finding Manson was a blessing, because she would become the focus of the
 group, bringing all manner of dark, brooding facets to the band's sound
 and direction. When the band's first self-titled album appeared in 1995,
 their success inevitably had critics reaching for the N-word. 'Garbage',
 however, was a lot more than old formulas rehashed - it had a gothic,
 industrial flavour to the all-pervading angst, more of a @{"Nine Inch Nails" link "NINE INCH NAILS"}
 than a Nirvana. Most importantly, it spawned a number of hits, thanks to
 the clever pop production values. The single that truly broke the band was
 the cheerfully miserable 'Only Happy When It Rains', with Manson doing
 a fine look-at-wretched-little-me act, a ploy that worked very well on
 follow-up single, 'Stupid Girl'. With new album 'Version 2.0' (1998),

 is still best loved in the far heavier incarnation from his early years.
 Moore's career first took off with @{"Skid Row" link "SKID ROW"}, not Bon Jovi's pet project
 featuring Seb Bach, but the Irish band with more traditional rock roots.
 He recorded two albums with them ('70's 'Skid' and '71's '34 Hours')
 before a solo effort, 1973's 'Grinding Stone'. His real leap into the
 limelight came, however, when he joined Phil Lynott and @{"Thin Lizzy" link "THIN LIZZY"} - he
 was with the band for only a few months in 1974 before truly making his
 name on the Lizzy classic, 1979's 'Black Rose'. One of the band's finest
 records it was a superb showcase for Moore's mercurial lead work, but
 being an uncompromising musician he jumped ship just as real fame
 threatened. Lizzy proved to be a perfect springboard into his most
 metallic and enjoyable period of the early 80s. 'Back On The Streets'
 gave him his famous signature track of 'Parisienne Walkways' before the
 likes of 'Corridors Of Power' and 'Victims Of The Future' made him a major
 influential rock attraction in his own right. This period of 80s success
 was sealed with a storming UK Top Five single hit with 1985's 'Out In The
 Fields', a song performed alongside Lizzy's Phil Lynott. Finally, with

 like poetry. A low-key debut, 'Keep The Faith' (1985), was just the
 beginning for what would prove to be a fun, if short-lived, reign as

 boogie approach to songwriting, 'Keep The Faith' was fine, but it was
 the major hit single 'Keep Your Hands To Yourself', with its lazily
 drawled vocals and charming swagger that put them and their eponymous
 1986 album at the top of the heap. Here was a band not afraid to mimic
 the greats and liberal splashes of the Rolling Stones and Faces peppered
 the record; they even covered Rod Stewart's 'Every Picture Tells A Story'.
 Follow-up albums, 'Open All Night' and 'In The Land Of Salvation And Sin',

 Few all-female rock bands are spoken of with quite such high regard as
 South London's Girlschool, a powerhouse of grinding guitars and staunchly

 their classic line-up consisted of Kim McAuliffe (guitar/vocals), Enid
 Williams (bass/vocals), Kelly Johnson (lead guitar/vocals) and Denise
 Dufort (drums) and with their brash biker metal sound, they set about
 convincing the macho world of rock that the girls could be just as tough
 as the boys. Famously, @{"Motorhead" link "MOTORHEAD"}'s Lemmy championed the band early on,
 helping them sign to Bronze Records and allowing them a support slot on
 an early Motorhead tour. Not that they necessarily needed the favours,
 because early albums such as 'Demolition' and 'Hit & Run' were speedy
 raucous albums of solid and powerful hard rock. The band's most memorable
 period, however, is doubtless their tongue-in-cheek collaboration with
 Motorhead for 1982's 'The St Valentine's Day Massacre' EP, which resulted
 in the two outfits covering each other's songs and playing the old Johnny
 Kidd classic 'Please Don't Touch' on 'Top Of The Pops'. This period is
 often looked upon with great affection, because thereafter a series of
 personnel shifts and a general feeling of disillusionment began to colour
 subsequent releases. Though the band continue to this day - they apparently

 Named after a shark known for taking the odd bite out of human flesh, you'd

 a reputation for hard-rocking blues, a style no doubt developed from long
 and hard study of the @{"Led Zeppelin" link "LED ZEPPELIN"} and Rolling Stones songbook. And with
 frontman Jack Russell a past master at whipping up a crowd, they were
 a superb good-time party outfit. Their debut was the Don Dokken-produced
 'Out Of The Night' EP, which got them a deal with EMI, but resulted in
 a poorly received debut album in 1984, and their subsequent split from
 the label. Their next EP, 'Shot In The Dark', is regarded as one of their
 finest and the album that came after it, 1987's 'Once Bitten...',
 is something of a minor classic, featuring a brace of highly melodic but
 rough 'n' ready belters, with Russell sounding particularly powerful.
 Subsequent recordings have been patchy, but the band clearly know where
 their strengths lie, and 'Recovery...Live' (1988) effectively captured
 the band at their best - that is, in a live context. The band continue

 This cheerful Californian trio can pretty much lay claim to having created
 the present pop punk format so carelessly thrashed around by so many bands
 these days. Forming back in Berkeley in 1990, the band originally traded
 under the unlikely named of the Sweet Children before they adopted their
 equally unlikely present name. Their first album, '39/Smooth', was
 completed, amazingly, in just one day and started them off on the road to
 three-chord punk heaven. By the time of 'Kerplunk' (1992), the so-called
 classic line-up of original members Billy Joe Armstrong (guitar/nasal
 vocals), Mike Dirnt (bass/slightly less nasal vocals) and new drummer
 Tre Cool (aka Frank Edwin Wright III) was in place. At this point, the
 band really began to borrow all the best bits from their punk forefathers.
 Their sound was unashamedly bright and poppy, but contained sufficient bite
 to be cool - a formula which went a major way to making 'Dookie' (1994) one
 of the most consistently enjoyable rock records of the '90s. The songs
 betrayed a touch of teenage angst here, a little sensitivity there, but the
 emphasis was on fun throughout. It was simple stuff and over 10 million
 people thought it was fantastic enough to buy! Having established the

 Few bands have the reputation of being genuinely dangerous - the Gunners

 Emerging from the LA sleaze scene in the mid '80s, Axl Rose (vocals),
 Slash (guitar), Izzy Stradlin' (guitar), Duff McKagan (bass) and Steven
 Adler (drums) enjoyed something of a bad boy reputation, even before they
 set foot in a studio. These guys almost literally lived on the street and
 did whatever they could to survive. Their suitably tacky 1986 debut
 'Live ?!*@ Like A Suicide' gave some indication of their worth, but it was
 with the unparalleled toxic charm of 'Appetite For Destruction' that the
 monster was truly spawned. This was rock 'n' roll at a visceral level.
 Ripping off the best moves from a number of obvious influences, ranging
 from the @{"Sex Pistols" link "SEX PISTOLS"} to @{"Aerosmith" link "AEROSMITH"}, 'Appetite...' gave them a string of
 hits ('Welcome To The Jungle', 'Paradise City', 'Sweet Child O' Mine')
 and let the band loose to trash hotel rooms and cause riots the world
 over, with Axl and his rampaging rock star ego leading from the front.
 They courted controversy with the semi-acoustic 'G N' R Lies' and its
 apparent attacks on ethnic minorities and homosexuals (the infamous
 'One In A Million'), and inevitable line-up changes due to drugs (natch).
 Come the early '90s, and with a massive world tour behind them, they
 returned with the monumental blow-out that was 'Use Your Illusion I & II',
 a bloated two-part epic - their attempt to make a 'Physical Graffiti'.
 Another massive bout of touring and an album of cover versions
 ('The Spaghetti Incident') later, and the band began to disintegrate,

 not for the exuberant carnival of bad taste the band indulge in while on
 stage. The individual members enjoy such absurd names as Oderus Urungus,
 Balsac The Jaws Of Death, Slymenstra Hymen and The Sexecutioner.
 And there's at least another four, all of them performing the most
 heinously twisted rock theatrics to complement the obviously deranged
 tunes. Dressed in alien barbarian costumes that would make Manowar think
 twice about where some of the spikes might end up by accident, they gleeful
 chuck around copious quantities of stage blood, luminous green semen and
 a variety severed limbs while bashing through their mutant metal.
 Unsurprisingly these antics have succeeded in getting them banned from
 venues all around the globe.

 HANOI ROCKS

 It's strange to think that one of the bands to follow on from the '70s
 legacy left by the likes of the New York Dolls would hail from Finland,
 but that's exactly where this bunch of hard-living maniacs called home.
 Formed back in 1980 and fronted by the androgynously charming Michael
 Monroe and his finely honed cheek bones, this ramshackle glam punk outfit
 pinched all the best bits from Bowie, the Stones, the New York Dolls -
 hell, the list is almost inexhaustible! - and splurged it out in a sleazy
 style which has since found favour with the likes of Backyard Babies and
 the Hellacopters, among other modern Scandinavian rock types. Their trash
 ethic was bound to make them stars if the likes of 'Back To Mystery City'
 (1983) and 'Two Steps From The Move' (1984) were anything to go by, were
 it not for the tragic fate that befell their drummer, Razzle.
 While touring the US in 1984, Razzle took an ill-advised car ride with
 a drunken Vince Neil, singer of @{"Motley Crue" link "MOTLEY CRUE"}, and the resulting car smash
 cost him his life. Hanoi were devastated and though they managed to
 continue for a short while afterward, the shock was too great and they
 eventually split.

 HEART

 The story of sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson is basically one of dedication
 and an almost unbelievable degree of self-belief. Heart started off in
 1974 as an essentially folky outfit. Not that they sang with one finger
 jammed in their ears, but their @{"Led Zeppelin" link "LED ZEPPELIN"}-inspired brand of rock was
 tempered by a gentle, whimsical nature. It was a rich mixture of influences
 and while Nancy was a superb guitarist, Ann's vocals were soaringly
 powerful. This early period for the band was characterised by debut album
 'Dreamboat Annie' and singles such as 'Crazy About You' and 'Magic Man',
 both US Top 40 hits. 1979's 'Dog And Butterfly' album was, perhaps, their
 most successful at capturing the complexities of melody and powerful
 guitarwork. Come the early '80s, however, and with serious personnel and
 legal problems dogging the band, they found themselves reduced to a duo
 and in desperate need of reinvention. At this career nadir, a new Heart
 was born, with a little help from MTV and a couple of superlative soft
 rock albums. Their eponymous 1985 album contained major hits 'What About
 Love?' and 'These Dreams', and 1987's 'Bad Animals' contained such smashes
 as 'Alone' and 'Never'. 1990's 'Brigade' did more of the same, and the
 plush soft rock template Heart stamped with their own inimitable identity
 proved to be their most enduring incarnation.

 HELLOWEEN

 German five-piece Helloween were always a little bit strange. When the rest
 of the thrash scene were busy riffing like demons and festooning their
 cover artwork with gore and skulls, they went for a sort of chirpy-style
 speed metal and, um, smiley pumpkins. Presumably in an effort to ape
 @{"Iron Maiden" link "IRON MAIDEN"}, Helloween adopted Pumpkinhead as a mascot and proceeded
 to borrow some of Maiden's galloping twin-guitar style too.
 First album 'Walls Of Jericho' was a tough-sounding speedfest, but they
 soon polished off the rough edges and streamlined the speed to conjure
 up the magnificently overblown 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys Part I'.
 The guitars were devastatingly precise and thunderously heavy, with the
 songs addressing everything from the nuclear arms race to the full-blown
 epic fantasy title track. And all the way through, there ran a weird
 streak of whimsical Teutonic humour. The follow-up, 1988's imaginatively
 titled 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys Part II', was more of the same, and the
 band won the opening slot at the Donington Monsters Of Rock Festival on the
 back of their 'Dr Stein' single. Following their initial run of success,
 however, key guitar genius Kai Hansen departed to form Gamma Ray, and the
 band lost momentum with 'Pink Bubbles Go Ape' and 'Chameleon'.
 Most recently, they have dabbled with a bunch of disparate cover versions
 on the decidedly odd 'Metal Jukebox' - presumably more of that German
 sense of humour shining through.

 HELMET

 Sometimes inappropriately lumped in with the grunge scene, New York's
 Helmet absolutely refused to have anything to do with the nascent grunge
 scene when they first formed back in 1989. They were less about jeans and
 flannel shirts and more about the disciplined intensity of noise.
 They began life in typical cult indie style by releasing a bunch of tough
 singles and EPs on the Amphetamine Reptile label and though their guitar
 violence shared some of the appeal of grunge for them, this was more by
 accident than design. Their aim was to keep arrangements to a minimum,
 thus exploring the true head-removing power of a single solid and violent
 riff, a blueprint followed to staggering effect with 1990's 'Strap It On'
 - a mean, pummeling record of primal garage mayhem. 1992's 'Meantime'
 found them dabbling with Steve Albini and his militantly raw recording
 values in the studio, and 1994's 'Betty' was really about as experimental
 as they would ever get. That is, not very. Around this time, the band were
 arguably at their commercial peak and recorded songs for inclusion on the
 soundtracks to 'Judgment Night' ('Just Another Victim' with House Of Pain)
 and 'The Crow' ('Milquetoast' recorded by production whizz Butch Vig).
 By the time of 'Aftertaste' (1997), they were back doing what they knew
 best - unleashing succinct chunks of ear-bleeding noise with an almost
 careless disregard for public safety.

 HENRY ROLLINS

 Henry Rollins is without doubt one of the most industrious artists
 currently working on the music scene. He has several books to his name
 (under his own publishing imprint), he is an actor, an accomplished spoken
 word show veteran and also one of the most intense recording artists to
 ever commit noise to tape. Henry's recording career began when he joined
 highly influential hardcore band Black Flag in 1981. He stayed with the
 band for five years and became their longest serving singer, all the while
 developing the manic persona that would become his trademark over the
 ensuing years. By 1986, he felt the time was right to go solo and he put
 a band together to record 1987's 'Hot Animal Machine'. It was raw and
 energetic, but vast improvements would be made to the hard 'n' heavy blues
 based rock sound Henry wanted to experiment with. 'Life Time', 'Do It'
 and 'Hard Volume' went some way to realising Henry's goal with tighter
 production values, but it was the start of the '90s that really catapulted
 Rollins into the limelight. The band landed the opening slot for the
 Lollapalooza tour of 1991, bringing them nationwide exposure, and for the
 first time mainstream rock fans could experience the full-scale breezeblock
 intensity of Rollins giving his all in performance. His career was almost
 cut short later the same year when he and friend Joe Cole were caught in
 a mugging; his friend was killed, but rather than take a break as any
 normal individual would to recover, Rollins worked through his emotions on
 tour. Both 'The End Of Silence' (1992) and 'Weight' (1994) were incredibly
 tough albums, exceeded only by his latest vein-bulging slabs of lyrical
 catharsis, 1997's 'Come In And Burn' and the classic hard rock influences
 of 2000's 'Get Some Go Again'.

 HOLE

 Hole's leading primal force, the often difficult and downright scary
 Courtney Love, has been many things in her life - an exotic dancer, an
 actress, but most successfully, the captain of one of grunge's most
 successful female-fronted groups. Hole actually began life in Los Angeles
 in 1989, but it was with a move to Seattle and the release of a couple of
 singles on the supercool Sub Pop label that Hole really began to take off.
 Their first album, 1991's 'Pretty On The Inside', was an uncompromising
 and raw collection of feminine angst, betraying at turns an aching
 vulnerability and a screeching harridan fury. It ripped and shredded with
 an unrestrained, but hugely appealing, sense of anger and loss, not least
 because of Love's lyrical phrasing which came damn close to a kind of
 barbed poetry. This style put her in the same creative arena as @{"Nirvana" link "NIRVANA"}
 and in 1992, she famously married Kurt Cobain, with whom she had a child,
 Francis Bean. 1994's 'Live Through This' found the Hole sound adopting
 more poise and melody, but the huge creative progressions were somewhat
 swamped by Cobain's suicide in the same year. A mere two months later
 Hole's bassist, Kristen Pfaff, died of a heroin overdose. Since then,
 Hole's output has been as erratic as Love's volatile temperament and
 a series of stopgap releases allowed her to indulge in acting once more
 and to begin making in-roads into modelling. Hole's most recent album
 'Celebrity Skin', however, proved that they were still a major musical
 force when it was released in 1998.

 IRON MAIDEN

 Leading lights of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal in the late '70s,
 the band dubbed themselves after the notorious medieval torture device
 and forged a suitably brazen and powerful sound to justify the name.
 With the solid direction provided ostensibly by bassist Steve Harris,
 they adopted the shock-haired, cadaverous Eddie as band mascot and
 unleashed their eponymous debut onto a rock scene still trying to absorb
 the shock of punk. With their modern, aggressive stance and singer
 Paul Di'Anno's growling style, they soon proved to be more than a match
 for the musical amateurism of that genre. It was with a new vocalist,
 Bruce Dickinson, however, that the band's obvious musical prowess began
 to lead them progressively upward. With Harris' punchy, galloping bass
 underpinning the tunes, Dickinson's famed air raid siren voice to the
 fore and epic songs that covered everything from straightforward horror
 stories to historical figures such as Alexander The Great, Iron Maiden
 rapidly became one of the biggest metal acts of the '80s. Consistently
 in the singles charts - no mean feat for a rock act - each successive
 album propelled them still higher. 1982's 'The Number Of The Beast' was
 their first world class effort, followed by 'Piece Of Mind' and
 'Powerslave', until with 'Somewhere In Time' and 1988's 'Seventh Son Of
 A Son', they were poised to leap into the rarefied atmosphere of rock's
 superleague. Then the inevitable happened. First, valued songwriter
 Adrian Smith left and then Dickinson. With guitarist Janick Gers and
 vocalist Blaze Bayley in their stead, the '90s were successful, but didn't
 match the unique world-conquering momentum they had mustered ten years
 earlier. Nevertheless, by the late '90s, yet another personnel sea change
 resulted in both Smith and Dickinson being reinstated to create a unique
 triple guitar attack and a stomping new album, 'Brave New World'.

 JANE'S ADDICTION

 Art and rock aren't usually linked in an equal relationship, but with
 Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell, the link was not only natural,
 but absolutely essential to the creation of a musically unique entity.
 Early live show experiences of the band were, by all accounts, like
 visiting some sort of nightmarish freakshow, an atmosphere readily evident
 on their self-financed eponymous live debut. Their wilfully perverse and
 skewed rock vision found its most fully realised conduit in 1988's
 magnificently strange, but superbly hard-rocking, 'Nothing's Shocking'.
 Still considered their finest album, its blend of thrash, punk, rock and
 funk seemed to taunt the closed-minded. The heady psychedelic barrage was
 led by Perry's shrill and surreal vocals and guitarist Dave Navarro's
 scorching six-string talents. The songs were about sex, romance, death,
 sex, power and, er, sex. Furthermore, the cover featured a Farrell
 constructed sculpture of naked Siamese twins with their heads on fire.
 The result? Instant notoriety and the album being sold in a tastefully
 ribbed rubber sleeve. A similar fate befell the superb follow-up, 'Ritual
 De Lo Habitual', again with a sleeve guaranteed to have the self-appointed
 moral guardians howling for rock star blood. It was sold in some places in
 a plain white sleeve with the US constitution's First Amendment printed on
 it. Again, musically, it was incredibly astute and dazzling with the
 stand-out cut being the staggering ten minute rush of 'Three Days'.
 Sadly, with such thoroughly intense and volatile characters in the band,
 things soon disintegrated in a very public and extremely rock 'n' roll
 fashion, with Farrell and Navarro exchanging punches on the Lollapalooza
 festival stage.

 JETHRO TULL

 Naming your band after an eighteenth century agriculturalist may not
 seem like the most sensible thing to do when forming a rock group, but then
 Jethro Tull were no ordinary band, preferring to indulge their own creative
 whims than to pander to what other people expected of them. Starting out
 as a blues outfit in 1967, their initial line-up was somewhat fluid, as
 the band began to establish a musical direction for themselves. The result
 of the first few years' toil was a move into progressive folk rock, a genre
 that Tull would soon make their own, mainly due to the single-minded
 creativity of songwriter Ian Anderson. A self-taught flautist and lyricist,
 he was arguably the band's visual focus as, wearing a prominent cod-piece,
 he took to histrionic flute-playing live, while often standing
 flamingo-like on one leg. As for the music, it may have been folky,
 but there was nothing fey about it, as Anderson's barbed and satirical
 lyrics were stinging in their accuracy and candour. The early '70s was
 arguably their creative peak and albums such as 'Stand Up', 'Benefit',
 but most famously 1971's 'Aqualung', featured innovative arrangements and
 a peculiarly English wit. The latter record, in particular, was a fine
 concept piece detailing the story of a tramp. Subsequent albums found the
 band adopting all sorts of concept ideas to varying degrees of critical
 success, but by the time of punk, they were looking decidedly wrong-footed
 as their style of rock became rapidly unfashionable. However, never ones
 to care much about fashion, the band have continued to release albums and
 tour successfully to this day.

 A truly influential and innovative technician Satriani's incredible skill

 originally found Satriani teaching the likes of @{"Steve Vai" link "STEVE VAI"} and @{"Metallica" link "METALLICA"}'s
 Kirk Hammett among many lesser known six stringers, but his first foray
 into solo recording came with an eponymous EP in 1985. It was with the
 albums 'Not Of This Earth' and 'Surfing With The Alien', however, that
 Satriani really made headway as a solo artist. He was capable of
 encompassing many different styles - often within the space of a single
 composition - and with various tunes he also displayed a sly sense of
 humour, a very tricky quality to express through the six strings of
 a guitar. 1989's 'Flying In A Blue Dream' was the record that truly broke
 his talents on both sides of the Atlantic and actually featured the man's
 vocal talents as well. Despite this departure from the established pattern
 the album proved to be a major showcase for his talents and the singles
 'Big Bad Moon' and 'I Believe' even received attention from MTV. This was
 the main period of Satriani's success and, even though he continued with

 jazz fusionists. Originally put together by guitar genius Neal Schon,
 who had played in Carlos Santana's band way back in 1972 the band
 unsurprisingly struggled to make a name for themselves and were actually
 threatened by their record label to get a singer or be dropped! With the
 arrival of phenomenal vocalist Steve Perry in 1977, they began to develop
 their smooth melodic hard rock sound with albums like 'Infinity',
 'Evolution', and 'Departure'. By the early '80s, they were already
 a platinum-selling act, following, essentially, in the melodic rock
 footsteps of pioneers such as @{"Free" link "FREE"} and @{"Bad Company" link "BAD COMPANY"}. However, with the
 addition of excellent keyboardist/guitarist Jonathan Cain, the Journey
 sound suddenly became massively successful. His songwriting boost gave
 them their all-time classic album in 1981's 'Escape', from beginning to
 end a polished AOR masterpiece; the sound of American radio rock had been
 officially established. 1986's 'Raised On Radio' repeated the mega-selling
 trick, and Journey went into the history books as one of the biggest,
 boldest and most melodic of rock bands ever. Period. Since then, the band
 has split, reformed and undergone some major personnel shifts, but they

 departed for a solo career. After a quiet period, the band returned in the

 One of the few truly pioneering artists to fuse rap and rock in a
 convincing manner, Kid Rock (aka Bob Ritchie) grew up in the small town
 of Romeo, Michigan, a suburb of the sprawling Detroit metropolis.
 During the early 80s the Kid was a veritable musical magpie absorbing
 every style of music that inspired him from Johnny Cash, to @{"Lynyrd Skynyrd" link "LYNYRD SKYNYRD"},
 to the pumping beats of Run DMC. This totally natural synthesis of diverse
 influences - and an unequivocal love of the rap star's hedonistic life
 style - inspired the Kid to spin the wheels of steel himself. The result
 was 1990's 'Grits Sandwiches For Breakfast' and a controversial hit in
 'Yodelling In The Valley'. The first of many expletive-fuelled raps,
 the oral sex subject matter and accompanying swearfest was just too much
 for the broadcast regulation authorities and a local radio station was
 slapped with a huge fine for playing it. There is, naturally, no better
 form of publicity and the Kid returned with two more sinfully exuberant
 albums packed with metallic rip offs and stolen samples - 'The Polyfuze
 Method' (1993) and 'Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp' (1996). The Kid was a bad
 to the bone, foul-mouthed, skirt-chasing exhibitionist and he didn't care
 who knew it. With this successful fusion of styles came his biggest hit
 yet, the breakthrough 'Devil Without A Cause'. The metal was potent and
 the raps eye-wateringly perverse, and just to deliver this with no small
 degree of authenticity the Kid put together his own group - the Twisted
 Brown Trucker Band - to bring a truly live KO punch to the sound.

 Surely one of the loudest, glammiest, trashiest rock bands ever to

 result of masterminds guitarist Paul Stanley and bassist Gene Simmons'
 desire to create a mythical rock legend in the mould of the Beatles:
 a gargantuan outfit with four distinct personalities making up the ranks,
 providing ample marketing opportunities for merchandising in the process!
 Formed back in 1972, it took the addition of guitarist Ace Frehley, drummer
 Pete Criss and a ton of greasepaint to launch Kiss in the guise most people
 revere them in. Since their spectacular rise in the States in the mid '70s,
 the band have gone through various line-up changes and recorded a fair few
 dodgy albums in their attempts to stay ahead of their public's fickle
 tastes, but it is for their initial period of success that they will
 forever be lauded. Starting with their 1974 self-titled debut, Kiss were
 rock gods of the decade, singing about girls, sex, rock 'n' roll,
 and more sex in a salacious and theatrical style that left nothing to the
 imagination - this was heavy metal turned into a Las Vegas cartoon.
 Their stage shows became the stuff of legend, what with the fire-breathing
 and various other cheesy stunts. 'Hotter Than Hell', 'Dressed To Kill',
 'Alive!' 'Destroyer' - hell, pick just about any of their mid '70s
 catalogue to experience huge riffs and ridiculously catchy choruses
 celebrating rock hedonism. Come the late '70s and punk, however, and it
 all started to go wrong as each member individually released a solo album
 which stiffed. The early '80s weren't much better and the band decided to
 'unmask' themselves. By the late '80s, with their popularity waning once
 more, the band decided that what the '90s needed was greasepaint again.
 Hence, for the last few years, Kiss have enjoyed something of a resurgence
 in fortune, especially with the release of 'Psycho Circus', an album
 praised as being a return to the magic Kiss formula of the '70s.

 Progenitors of nu-metal, this relatively young Californian outfit have been
 at the forefront of the latest rock trend to sweep through the world of

 outfit LAPD's musical core with Sexart singer Jonathan Davis, Korn were
 unique right from their inception. In Davis, they had a singer not afraid
 to recount the most harrowing and unsavoury of episodes from his personal
 and family life, and his style would often range from outright shrieking
 to a machine-gun rattle of rap and rage. The lyrical angst was augmented
 by a brutal, downtuned sludge style of metal, with Davis also pitching in
 with hideous squalls of bagpipe noise! For some reason, this rhythmic style
 was unimaginatively dubbed 'funk metal' at first, but by the time of Korn's
 first self-titled album in 1994, it was quite clear they had forged a
 unique sound for the '90s which incorporated the coolness of hip-hop with
 the thunder of powerful rock. Not only that, but they were uniquely aware
 of their street level appeal, and they adopted their now-ubiquitous sports
 wear theme. Follow-up album 'Life Is Peachy' sounded even more painfully
 intense than the debut and by the time of 'Follow The Leader' in 1998,
 the band had become fully fledged MTV rock stars at the top of the metal

 Southern California, Kyuss were just such a band. Formed back in the very
 early '90s by guitarist Josh Homme, vocalist John Garcia, bassist Nick
 Oliveri and drummer Brant Bjork, they made name for themselves in their
 local area as a ferocious live act. Their first album, 1991's 'Wretch',
 failed to capture their sound, but they did grab the attention of Chris
 Goss, singer/guitarist of Masters Of Reality. He had been attracted by
 Kyuss' organic shaping of that classic '70s rock sound, the fuzzy riffage
 of Blue Cheer, the doomy melancholy of @{"Black Sabbath" link "BLACK SABBATH"} and those distinct
 undercurrents of barely restrained psychedelia. The album he produced with
 them would become the benchmark by which 'stoner' rock would be judged in
 the '90s. 'Blues For The Red Sun' was superbly heavy and strikingly
 innovative, even though it recycled the standards of the past. Sadly,
 even as the stoner phenomenon had found its stylistic template, Kyuss
 began to fall apart after the monumental 'Sky Valley' album. 'And The
 Circus Leaves Town' suffered from being produced by a band in its death
 throes and with that, they all split to form various similar outfits such

 should go down like a lead zeppelin'. Whatever the genesis of the name,
 it would have meant nothing had the music been less than magnificent.
 At first using a heavy blues approach the band's sound developed rapidly
 during the '70s to incorporate everything from funk to reggae, and with
 it - under the guidance of manager Peter Grant, often dubbed the fifth
 member - their stature grew as they became one of the biggest, most
 outrageous acts in the world, a name synonymous with rock star excess.
 Not only was their lifestyle flamboyant but the albums became ever more
 ambitious and lavish. Most famous for the mystical classic 'Stairway To
 Heaven' on the gloriously diverse 'Led Zeppelin IV', their expansive and
 overtly experimental approach is best captured on the monumental,
 fantastically overblown double album extravaganza 'Physical Graffiti' in
 1975. Despite the obviously rock dinosaur-culling power of the '70s punk

 LIMP BIZKIT

 Yet another band somewhat loosely lumped in with the fresh nu-metal
 phenomenon, there's really a lot more to the Limp Bizkit game plan than
 simple angst and a penchant for gut-churning, downtuned guitars.
 Somewhat bizarrely, the band began life in that haven of southern rock,
 Jacksonville, Florida. There was nothing even remotely 'southern' about
 the style of music vocalist Fred Durst and bassist Sam Rivers were
 interested in making, however. Theirs was a uniquely '90s brand of rock,
 suffused with the street cred of hip-hop and the punk attitude of grunge.
 Most importantly they knew how to deliver with intensity. Famously,
 post-gig, Korn's bassist Fieldy and guitarist Head found themselves in
 Durst's tattoo parlour, where the ambitious frontman befriended them,
 and they passed his band demo tape on to legendary metal producer Ross
 Robinson. Hence support slots with the likes of House Of Pain resulted
 and when those hip-hoppers called it a day, the Bizkit grabbed their
 DJ Lethal. The Limp Bizkit picture was now complete. With DJ Lethal
 providing a vibey, infectious groove by using his turntable skills like
 another instrument, it was just a matter of time before this modern
 rock-rap hybrid caught the attention of the MTV generation. 1997's 'Three
 Dollar Bill Y'All$' was a major hit. By the time of 1999's follow-up,
 'Significant Other', Durst was fulfilling his ambitions to become
 a major influence in the world of entertainment, and the album, as
 a result, features a plethora of big name performers, ranging fro

 LITA FORD

 When all-girl band @{"The Runaways" link "THE RUNAWAYS"} crashed and burned at the end of the 70s
 only two of the members went on to anything resembling stardom. One was,
 of course, Joan Jett (with her Blackhearts) and the other was blonde
 bombshell Lita Ford. Ford had actually started to learn the guitar at the
 tender age of eleven, so by the time of the early 80s all she had to do
 was develop her singing voice in order to launch a solo career.
 The direction she took was slightly removed from the punky glam bad-girl
 rock of her previous outfit, however. For the 80s a more streamlined sound
 was de rigeur, but 1983's 'Out For Blood' album was, nevertheless, a fine
 showcase for her guitar talents, proving that when it came to rock she
 could play as tough as any man. Despite this obvious success the 80s
 proved to be rather patchy and she eventually went on to record
 'The Bride Wore Black' for RCA, a record that was never released.
 Towards the end of the decade, however, rock had found a mainstream
 presence in the pop charts and 1988's 'Lita' was her biggest and most
 successful album containing hit singles in both 'Kiss Me Deadly' and her
 famed duet with @{"Ozzy Osbourne" link "OZZY OSBOURNE"} 'Close My Eyes Forever'. The latter gave
 both artists their first ever US Top Ten hit. For some reason best known
 to Ford she then went on to marry @{"WASP" link "WASP"} wild man Chris Holmes before
 realising the error of her ways, and as an artist suffered greatly in the
 grunge explosion of the early 90s.

 LIVE

 Just as punk brought a few really innovative and influential outfits to
 the fore in the 70s so grunge brought a few worthwhile bands to prominence
 in the early 90s, and Pennsylvanian four piece Live have proved to be one
 of the most musically adventurous and stylish bands to remain once the wave
 subsided. Choosing themselves such a confusing name may have betrayed
 a certain nave charm, but 1991's 'Mental Jewelry' was actually, in complete
 contrast, a surprisingly accomplished debut featuring elements of a heavier
 REM and the knowing classic sound of, say, @{"Pearl Jam" link "PEARL JAM"}. However, if 'Mental
 Jewelry' had placed Live at least in the rock audience's consciousness
 then 1994's 'Throwing Copper' would take all the band's sophisticated
 qualities and amplify them a thousand fold. In short, it was an artistic
 and commercial masterpiece, not least because the band had forged a cast
 iron MTV hit in 'I Alone' and its Jonathan Demme-directed video. Curiously
 the album hung around the chart for around a year before actually crawling
 to the number one slot, but part of its success must be attributed to
 a superior talent in songwriting displayed by lead singer and guitarist
 Ed Kowalczyk. Unfortunately, 1997's 'Secret Samadhi' was a rather lumpen
 affair compared to the muscular power of its predecessors but with 1999's
 'The Distance To Here' the band had rediscovered their muse to terrific
 effect and the results were stunningly diverse.

 LYNYRD SKYNYRD

 Possibly the finest ever southern rock band to take the stage, the
 influence and musical grandeur of Skynyrd is quite incredible considering
 the tragic history of the band. Since their inception in Jacksonville,
 Florida, in 1965, they have become synonymous with Dixie rock of a very
 distinctive, southern-fried flavour which incorporated both power and
 sweet, sweet melody in almost equal measure. Influenced by the likes of
 Cream, the Rolling Stones, and the Allman Brothers their classic period
 was doubtless the early to mid 70s when they recorded such wondrously
 hard-rocking gems as 'Pronounced Leh-nerd Sky-nerd', 'Second Helping'
 'Nothin' Fancy' and 'Gimme Back My Bullets'.
 Their debut, 'Pronounced...', also gave the band one of the world's most
 enduring rock anthems to the hard-living rock 'n' roll lifestyle in the
 monumental 'Freebird', complete with its epic triple guitar lead break.
 This halcyon period of rollicking honky tonk rock came to a sudden end
 in 1977, however, when the band, having just released the fine 'Street
 Survivors' album, were involved in a plane crash which killed singer
 Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, his sister, backing singer
 Cassie Gaines, and personnel manager Dean Kirkpatrick. It took a very
 long time and several line-up and name changes before an outfit displaying
 anything like the power and charm of the original incarnation could evolve.
 But with Ronnie's brother Johnny as the vocalist the band are finally doing
 justice to the memory of their previous incarnation.

 MACHINE HEAD

 When it comes to modern heavy metal, straight and pure, then California's
 Machine Head are the triumphant leaders in the brutality stakes. Led very
 much from the front by guitarist/vocalist Robb Flynn, the band first
 formed around 1992 with the express desire to be the heaviest, most intense
 metallic experience on the face of the planet. They succeeded. In the wake
 of such pioneering acts as @{"Metallica" link "METALLICA"} and @{"Megadeth" link "MEGADETH"}, it was inevitable for
 the new generation to bring something new to the mix and Machine Head did
 so with a touch of hip hop style and a whole lot of angst, which was
 perfect for the grunge period. Expect that Machine Head had nothing to
 with grunge and everything to do with intense emotional pain delivered
 with the punch and precision of a jack hammer to the temple. The band's
 live shows rapidly became the stuff of legend for sheer, brain-shredding
 power while Flynn's tales of inner torment and anguish added an extra
 abrasive edge. This intensity was accurately captured on their 1994 debut
 'Burn My Eyes', and 1997's 'The More Things Change...', both of which
 lodged Machine Head at the vanguard of the nu-metal explosion. 1999's
 'The Burning Red' opened up their sound somewhat, with a greater emphasis
 on melody but with no less weight to their musical muscle.

 MANOWAR

 'Death to False Metal!' was their battle cry - and they definitely meant
 it. When Manowar formed in 1980, their sole aim was to rid the world of
 wimpy false metal and to lead their troops into metal heaven. Or Valhalla.
 Or wherever it is that true metal resides. Led by bassist Joey DeMaio and
 the huge personality of guitarist Ross The Boss, they were such an
 exaggerated outfit that they really didn't require anyone to talk them up.
 They would wear loin clothes, they would play on 11, they even signed their
 record contract in blood! Their magnificently over-the-top image was
 compounded by the music. 1982's glorious debut 'Battle Hymns' was a
 triumphant blow in their epic fight for the music they loved (it even
 featured a guest appearance by Orson Welles on 'Dark Avenger') and 'Into
 Glory Rides', 'Hail To England', 'Fighting The World', 'Sign Of The Hammer'
 and 'Kings Of Metal' were among the albums of the '80s that took the band
 to their peak. They were aggressive, theatrical and totally devoid of a
 sense of irony. The latter album, incredibly, did not feature the sting
 of Ross The Boss, who had left in 1988, but instead featured Death Dealer!
 The band have continued into the '90s and beyond, but have concentrated
 mainly on Europe where their fans - The, er, Army Of The Immortals - are
 most vociferous.

 @{"Alice Cooper" link "ALICE COOPER"} may have pioneered the whole shock rock movement in the 70s,
 but for the MTV-dependent 90s and the new millennium Marilyn Manson (aka
 Brian Warner) is definitely the icon of choice among discerning metal fans
 keen to upset their parents and teachers. Warner's career actually started
 out in the realms of music journalism which doubtless gave him the
 incentive to launch his career as the androgynous gothic freak nightmare
 of Marilyn Manson. Starting out as Marilyn Manson And The Spooky Kids,
 before becoming simply Marilyn Manson, the band rapidly formed something
 of a major reputation in their home locale of south Florida,
 the conservative nature of the area highlighting their deliberate mission
 to offend any self-appointed moral guardians. Winning a supporting slot
 with @{"Nine Inch Nails" link "NINE INCH NAILS"} the band signed to Trent Reznor's Nothing Records,
 the perfect home for their sub-industrial glam grind. Their 1994 debut
 'Portrait Of An American Family' was a solid enough stab at skewering the
 values of middle America but with 1996's 'Antichrist Superstar' and its
 slew of MTV hit singles - aided by some dazzling video work - Manson became
 public enemy number one. As if it were possible, 1998 follow-up 'Mechanical

 MC5

 Along with bands like Iggy And The Stooges, the Motor City 5 - so-called
 because they were formed in Detroit, Michigan - were pioneers in the garage
 style of rock, a genre which led to the punk explosion of the 70s and is
 still cranked out to this day by the likes of Backyard Babies and
 Hellacopters. When the band was first formed back in 1965 by the nucleus
 of Rob Tyner (vocals), Wayne Kramer (guitar) and Fred 'Sonic' Smith
 (guitar) they had limited success with a couple of singles releases,
 but under the guidance of the politically radical DJ and jazz critic
 John Sinclair they became a major musical force by adopting a free-style
 jazz approach to their feedback-drenched thrashes. Espousing revolution
 and political struggle rather than any hippy drippy sentiments of the
 flower power generation they recorded a stunningly powerful live debut
 in the classic 'Kick Out The Jams'. When first released in 1969 the
 record was banned from many retail outlets because of the infamous and
 much-sampled intro rap from Brother J C Crawford which featured the battle
 cry "Kick out the jams, motherfuckers!". Despite the bans the record went
 on to become an iconic release of the time. The band, however, decided to
 go a more commercial route thereafter, soundwise at least, and they parted
 from Sinclair to record 'Back In The USA', another hard-hitting slice of
 primal revolutionary rock. Unfortunately, third album 'High Time' only
 enjoyed a limited success and the band split in 1972.

 MEGADETH

 Having been unceremoniously booted out of @{"Metallica" link "METALLICA"} just as they were
 on the verge of breaking through with their first album, guitarist
 Dave Mustaine became a man driven by the urgent need to be successful
 - just to show his former bandmates that he could do anything they could,
 only better. With the burgeoning thrash scene forming the perfect backdrop,
 Megadeth's career began to parallel that of Metallica's as Mustaine put his
 previous songwriting experience to good use and came up with the chirpily
 titled 'Killing Is My Business And Business Is Good'. The sound was rough,
 but with 1986's 'Peace Sells But Who's Buying', that glitch was ironed out
 and the chunky, speedy, technical style of riffing Megadeth would become
 known for was born. 1988's 'So Far So Good So What?' brought in yet more
 line-up changes as Mustaine kept toying with the make-up of the band.
 The '90s incarnation of the band saw them slowing the pace somewhat and
 with the addition of guitar virtuoso Marty Friedman, the quality of the
 writing became more melodic and considered, though Mustaine was as reliably
 pessimistic as before, dealing with a range of heavy topics such as
 environmental catastrophe and nuclear extinction. With 1999's 'Risk',
 however, Mustaine led the band into almost melodic rock territory.
 The result of this unexpected shift in direction has yet to be determined.

 METALLICA

 If one had to choose a band that defined the thrash era of the mid-'80s,
 yet had it in them to re-forge their identity for the more media-conscious
 '90s, then these Bay Area reprobates will feature at the top of any
 credible list. Formed ostensibly by drummer Lars Ulrich in 1981, a Danish
 national who had fallen in love with rock music ever since being taken to
 a @{"Deep Purple" link "DEEP PURPLE"} concert by his jazz musician father, Metallica were the
 leading lights of thrash in the '80s and became one of the biggest
 mainstream rock bands of the '90s. Their overtly uncompromising and speedy
 approach to metal led to 'Kill 'Em All', 'Ride The Lightning' and 'Master
 Of Puppets', with the latter 1986 album still considered as one of the most
 inventively intense albums in modern metal. Every single one of these
 records displays the stamp of a band very much steeped in the metallic
 traditions of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal and influential outfits
 such as @{"Diamond Head" link "DIAMOND HEAD"}. The band's inexorable rise to the top was almost
 derailed by the death of bassist Cliff Burton in a freak road accident
 while on tour in autumn 1986. His replacement was ex-Flotsam and Jetsam
 bassist Jason Newsted and with a revitalised line-up, the band went on to
 release one of the most important albums of the early '90s, their infamous
 eponymous 'black' album. Containing a number of hits singles, including
 'Enter Sandman', this more mid-paced and commercially polished effort
 gave the band license to stretch themselves in all manner of creative

 This supremely talented guitar player actually formed the @{"Scorpions" link "SCORPIONS"} with

 touring with British hard rock legends @{"UFO" link "UFO"}. During this period, the
 eccentric guitarist made a huge name for himself for frenetic and
 impassioned playing - he wasn't so much a technical wizard, as thoroughly
 able to whip up a storming vibe. His UFO highlights are best sampled on
 albums such as 'Force It' and 'Lights Out', but when it was no longer fun
 playing alongside singer Phil Mogg and his alcohol-fuelled bandmates,
 Schenker jumped ship and formed the Michael Schenker Group in 1980.
 One self-titled debut album later, and he had re-invented himself as the
 leader of one of the finest hard rock outfits of the '80s. With 1981's
 confusingly titled follow-up 'MSG', he effectively wrote a theme tune for
 himself with 'Attack Of The Mad Axeman'. At this point, vocalist Gary
 Bardens was replaced by the infinitely more powerful talents of ex-@{"Rainbow" link "RAINBOW"}
 singer Graham Bonnet, and the band's future looked set to be very bright.
 Unfortunately, come the mid to late '80s and the band's line-up seemed to
 involve a revolving door policy as the band became known as the McAuley
 Schenker Group when Far Corporation singer Robin McAuley joined the ranks.
 The quality of the albums became, at best, mundane and Schenker has most

 MINISTRY

 Delving back into the dim and distant past of some outfits it can be
 remarkable what you'll find, and so it is with Chicago's Ministry. The
 band's current incarnation, and the one they are doubtless best known
 for, casts them as industrial metal pioneers, who along with the likes
 of @{"Nine Inch Nails" link "NINE INCH NAILS"} introduced dance beats and overt use of technology to
 create a bleak and intensely dark sonic assault. When Ministry first came
 into existence, however, in 1981, it was a vehicle for multi-instrumentalist
 Al Jourgensen. The initial Ministry sound was also a lot closer to 80s
 pop bands like Thompson Twins or Depeche Mode. By 1985 this direction had
 changed radically as Jourgensen adopted the harsher sound of Euro-dance
 influences. The late 80s brought many side projects, including Revolting
 Cocks and Lard (with Jello Biafra of Dead Kennedys), which reflected this
 tougher more metalized sound. In the early 90s bassist Paul Barker,
 drummer William Rieflin and occasional vocalist Chris Connelly joined.
 From then on the Ministry machine pumped out dense, aggressive techno-metal
 which has since influenced a whole new generation of industrial style rock
 bands, including, most notably, @{"Marilyn Manson" link "MARILYN MANSON"}. 1988's 'Land Of Rape And
 Honey' started this revolution, followed by 'The Mind Is A Terrible Thing
 To Taste' and the era-defining 'Psalm 69' (1992). Despite the pioneering
 and successful nature of the music Jourgensen still managed to loose
 ground by getting arrested for heroin abuse and it took four years for
 'Filth Pig' to emerge, and another three for the ironically titled
 'Dark Side Of The Spoon' to see the light of day.

 It is probably fair to say that had it not been for some high level

 @{"Guns N' Roses" link "GUNS N' ROSES"}, then the legendary gorehounds would have languished as
 forgotten underground punk heroes. As it is their raw and succinct hardcore
 bludgeon coupled with a love of b-movie horror flicks has proved to be
 a potent formula, obviously influencing some very notable artists over the
 years - pretty good going, considering the atrocious quality of some of
 the recordings. Originally formed in the mid 70s the most stable personnel
 in the line-up were one Glenn @{"Danzig" link "DANZIG"} (vocals) and Jerry Only (bass).
 A variety of guitarists and drummers came and went, and the band amassed
 a cult following by churning out a series of highly collectible singles
 and EPs. These would eventually be collected into compilations such as
 1985's 'Legacy Of Brutality' and the band only really ever recorded one
 proper album: 'Walk Among Us' (1982). They called it a day in 1983 and
 Danzig went on to form first Samhain then his own eponymous outfit.
 Meanwhile the cult of the Misfits grew throughout the 80s and 90s, thanks
 to various cover versions by the previously mentioned megastars, and then,
 in 1996, Jerry Only decided it was time for the dead to walk again and so
 the chilled corpse of the band was wheeled out of deep freeze and
 re-animated. The results were quite spectacular. With Michael Graves

 Formed back in 1989 with their space cadet leader guitarist/vocalist Dave
 Wyndorf at the helm, Monster Magnet were one of the first modern bands
 to define the currently trendy 'stoner' sound, along with the likes of
 @{"Kyuss" link "KYUSS"}. More fuzzed up than Blue Cheer, heavier than @{"Black Sabbath" link "BLACK SABBATH"}, more
 psychedelic than the Summer Of Love, these guys were so reckless and
 deranged they actually tried to dose an audience with acid and were almost
 killed in the ensuing chaos. 1991's 'Spine Of God' was the first full
 length album to mark them out for special attention both critically and
 among the growing 'stoner' cognoscenti. Subsequent LPs 'Superjudge' and
 'Dopes To Infinity' were, if anything, heavier and more acutely honed
 with Wyndorf musing on all manner of unsavoury and cosmic subject matter
 over a welter of concrete slab riffs. The band's most recent adventures
 into mind-expanding hi-fi, however, 'Powertrip', has catapulted them from

 One of the major formative influences on the Florid death metal scene the

 in order to bring some real artistry to the more brutal excesses of the
 genre. Still well-respected on the underground scene, the band have
 maintained their cult status, yet brought a great deal of finesse - well,
 as much as is possible! - into their area of expertise. Following the
 occult tenet espoused by Anton LaVey, NDo what thou wilta the band did
 not allow the rules of the genre dictate what or how they could achieve
 anything. When they first started their own sense of quality control kept
 them refining their sound through various gigs and demos for four years
 before they recorded (but never released) 'Abominations Of Desolation'.
 Their first full album was the brutal thrash benchmark 'Altars Of Madness'
 (1989), and since then successive albums - 'Blessed Are The Sick',
 'Covenant', 'Domination' and their most recent studio effort 'Formulas

 MOTLEY CRUE

 Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll - a perfectly succinct way to sum up this true
 behemoth of sleazy rock. When Vince Neil (vocals), Mick Mars (guitars),
 Nikki Sixx (bass) and Tommy Lee (drums) came together in LA, in 1981, their
 only grand design was to party. And party they did, often in the most
 controversial and dangerous manner possible - whether it was picking fights
 and fuelling feuds with @{"Guns N' Roses" link "GUNS N' ROSES"}, ODing on heroin or driving a car
 while so drunk that a crash kills you passenger. The latter incident
 involving Vince Neil not only ended the life of @{"Hanoi Rocks" link "HANOI ROCKS"} drummer Razzle
 (and, effectively, the Rocks' youthful career), but it almost finished
 Crue off too. Meanwhile the former incident (involving Sixx, and supposedly
 inspiring the song 'Kickstart My Heart') is only surprising in that no one
 from the band has actually died yet. Still, such a catalogue of bad boy
 behaviour is not that far removed from the music which right from debut
 belter 'Too Fast For Love' was a manifesto for hedonism, a dumb-ass
 nightmare of NY Dolls and @{"Kiss" link "KISS"} trash dressed up in leather and spandex
 and kept erect with far too much hairspray. Crue were immensely derivative
 and yet hugely influential at the same time. Follow-up, 1983's 'Shout At
 The Devil' ensured their status as possibly the world's most dangerous
 band while '85's 'Theatre Of Pain' was a weak blip they'd surely rather
 forget. If those albums at least marked them out for fame then 1987's
 'Girls, Girls, Girls' and 1989's 'Dr Feelgood' are the records for which
 they will be best remembered as down and dirty rockers with a voracious
 appetite for mayhem. Subsequent years have been less than salubrious for
 the band, however, as Neil was ousted for one album before being
 re-instated (in time for 1997's 'Generation Swine'), just in time to see
 Lee bizarrely leaving to pursue a rap career in Methods Of Mayhem.

 When it comes to full-on pulverizing power, Motorhead have always been,

 self-confessed speedfreak Lemmy (aka the tamer-sounding Ian Kilmister),
 the all-time classic line-up consisted of the appropriately monikered
 'Fast' Eddie Clarke (guitar) and Phil 'Philthy Animal' Taylor (drums).
 This titanic trio was responsible for some of the finest rock albums of
 the '70s and '80s. Never less than utterly brutal, they captured the
 speed of punk and harnessed it to the power of more traditional blues
 based metal to produce a uniquely British sound brilliantly captured on
 the likes of 'Overkill', 'Bomber', and the marvellous mayhem of the live
 album 'No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith'. Meanwhile, 'Ace Of Spades' - featuring
 the definitive title track and spoof spaghetti western cover - remains
 a standard to which other rock bands can only aspire. A decidedly dodgy
 patch in the early '80s - due to management problems and line-up changes
 - nevertheless saw Lemmy score again with the likes of 'Orgasmatron' and
 '1916', the latter boasting all manner of experimental touches alongside
 the standard issue brain shredders. With their future as an enduring

 Although industrial music's roots can be traced way back into the 70s,
 it is without doubt the work of a few noted artists in the 90s that has
 made the genre into such a success. Nine Inch Nails is one such outfit,
 but it is in reality very much a one man band, a vehicle for musician
 Trent Reznor to delve into the dark and tortured recesses of his tormented
 psyche. It was with 1989's 'Pretty Hate Machine' that the Nails phenomenon
 was launched and through repeated MTV play of the single 'Head Like A Hole'
 Reznor soon became the coolest producer of abrasive sounds. A couple of
 very accomplished EPs followed, cunningly titled 'Broken' and 'Fixed'
 respectively and Reznor's status as angstmeister for the MTV generation
 was assured. Reznor was then asked by film-maker Oliver Stone to create
 the soundtrack to the controversial Natural Born Killers in 1994, and
 Reznor's own second album 'The Downward Spiral' was released in the same
 year. Yet again the music was violent and traumatic with the likes of
 singles 'March Of The Pigs' and 'Closer' bringing a somewhat incongruously
 commercial pop edge to proceedings. The fact that the album was recorded
 in the house that Charles Manson's Family murdered actress Sharon Tate
 and her friends added a certain depressing cachet to the already bleak
 catalogue of anguish. A full five years later 'The Fragile' emerged as
 a plush double CD of bile and fury underlining the fact that although
 Reznor is not one of the genres most prolific writers he is, nevertheless,
 one of its most fiercely innovative artists.

 If there was one band that epitomised the sound of grunge then it had to be

 in 1986. Comprised of Kurt Cobain (guitar/vocals) and Chris Novoselic
 (bass), they went through a succession of drummers before finally settling
 on ex-Scream member Dave Grohl. With something of a landmark album already
 to their name - the fuzz-drenched 'Bleach' emerged in 1989 - the band took
 mainstream rock influences and twisted them beyond all recognition for what
 was to become the most important release of the 1990s. If Cobain had hinted
 at a melodic pop sensibility beneath the grimy production of 'Bleach' then
 'Nevermind' (1991) stripped away the filth and presented his songwriting
 abilities to an unsuspecting public. Unwittingly, Cobain had tapped into
 the zeitgeist of the time. Overtly punk influenced the band turned the
 accepted view of rock upside down and helped create a movement that
 virtually wiped out the bloated big-haired excesses of '80s rock.
 The media coined the phrase Generation X to describe disaffected youth of

 by vocalist John Spence and brother and sister team Eric (keyboards) and

 - not least because Spence actually committed suicide not long after the

 singularly failed to make major headway. When they entered the studio in
 1994 to record 'Tragic Kingdom' (eventually released 1996), things looked
 decidedly shaky and they funded their own sessions. When the album was
 released, however, their timing couldn't have been more perfect.
 With the mid '90s rock scene entertaining such pop-punk acts as @{"Green Day" link "GREEN DAY"},
 No Doubt's punky ska hybrid slotted very nicely into people's expectations.

 (guitar) and Greg Kriesel (bass), they eventually added Ron Welty (drums)
 for a thoroughly unremarkable self-titled debut in 1989. They struggled as
 any good punk band should, desperately trying to land a decent recording
 deal. Having signed to Epitaph in the early '90s, their songwriting skills
 having been thoroughly honed in the intervening years, they were ready to
 release 'Ignition' in 1992. The difference between the new Offspring and
 the old was astonishing - but still not astonishing enough to break into
 the wider consciousness. Sure, the playing was tight and powerful; sure,
 Holland's nasal whine was perfect for tales of youthful alienation and
 delivering satirically barbed lyrics; but a little more polish was
 required. In the mid '90s, the climate was just right in the wake of
 grunge for more alternative style bands to bleed into the mainstream
 and with the likes of @{"Green Day" link "GREEN DAY"} already softening up the charts, the
 Offspring's time had come. 'Smash' literally was that - a ripping set of
 hooky punk complete with singles such as 'Come Out And Play' and the UK
 Top 40 hit 'Self Esteem'. Follow-up 'Ixnay On The Hombre' simply gave the
 kids more of what they wanted, but the best was yet to come with 1998's
 'Americana' album and its UK No. 1 hit single, 'Pretty Fly (For A White
 Guy)'. One thing's for sure, they may still have respect in some quarters
 of the hardcore underground, but to everyone else, they're rock stars now!

 OZZY OSBOURNE

 Rock's most likeable loony, Ozzy Osbourne has made a career out of
 acting like a total and utter nutcase. With his early years spent in
 @{"Black Sabbath" link "BLACK SABBATH"}, Ozzy had already experienced the fraught intensity of
 working in a band, so when he took flight for a solo career in 1978, all he
 wanted to do was make music on his own terms. And, boy, what a fine legacy
 he's left the world of rock. Whether he was creating electrifying rock 'n'
 roll or chewing on doves and live bats, no one could escape the man's
 influence! Although he has continued to record right up to the present day,
 and become the figurehead of one of the most successful touring operations
 of recent years - the enormous Ozzfest experience - his albums have become
 relatively solid and reliable, rather than dazzling. This, however, is in
 stark contrast with his early solo output. With a classic line-up of
 drummer Lee Kerslake (ex-@{"Uriah Heep" link "URIAH HEEP"}), bassist Bob Daisley (ex-@{"Rainbow" link "RAINBOW"}) and
 a certain guitar whiz known as Randy Rhoads (ex-@{"Quiet Riot" link "QUIET RIOT"}), Ozzy created
 some of the finest hard rock albums of the '80s. When 'Blizzard Of Ozz'
 was released in 1980, it was packed with classic tunes, many of which
 still figure in Ozzy's show today; 'Crazy Train', 'Mr Crowley', 'Suicide
 Solution' - the list goes on. With not a single filler in earshot, it was
 a stunning blend of Ozzy's daft sense of humour and the band's incredible
 musical prowess, a feat that was repeated with 1981's marvellous 'Diary Of
 A Madman'. Tragically, Rhoads was killed in a plane crash while on tour in
 the US and although Ozzy deeply mourned the loss of such an immensely
 talented musician, he eventually found another very different, but highly
 skilled individual. Jake E Lee's first Ozzy album was 'Bark At The Moon'
 and he played right through the band's commercial peak during the mid '80s,
 until he was replaced by Zakk Wylde on 1988's 'No Rest For The Wicked'.
 Most recentl,y Ozzy's solo career has been on hold due to the Black Sabbath
 reunion tours, but who knows when rock's original crazy man will strike
 again?

 PANTERA

 These original, self-dubbed 'Cowboys From Hell' are surely one the
 tightest, heaviest metal acts stalking the stages of the world's arenas
 today. But it wasn't always so, because back in the big-haired '80s,
 Pantera were actually closer to a glam band than they might feel
 comfortable admitting to now, with spandex, poodle perms, the works.
 Still, with over five years work - and a brace of albums - already behind
 them, it was with a change of vocalist that they began to mutate into the
 extreme metal titans they surely are today. Singer Phil Anselmo joined
 'Dimebag' Darrel (guitar), Rex Brown (bass) and Vinnie Paul (drums) in
 1986 and 'Power Metal' (1988) was their last flirtation with their
 Kiss-addled past. And if this album already displayed a more marked
 aggression, then that was as nothing compared to the squealing, riffing
 monster unleashed with 'Cowboys From Hell' (1990). The boys, it seemed,
 had only just embraced thrash, but they were to take the genre to hitherto
 unexplored areas. With each successive album, they became increasingly
 angular and brutal; 1992's 'Vulgar Display Of Power' at least contains
 some melody, whereas, say, 1996's 'Great Southern Trendkill' sacrifices
 most of its tunes to the great God Of Riff and Anselmo's barely controlled
 rage. Over more recent years, the band's work rate has dropped off
 somewhat, not least because of Anselmo's near-fatal brush with heroin
 addiction in 1996, but their most recent album, 'Reinventing The Steel',
 at least proves that this particular monster is never going to die easily.

 PARADISE LOST

 Few bands can develop so far from their roots and yet retain a sense of
 authentic credibility; Paradise Lost have not only managed to do this with
 great finesse, but with great imagination also. Formed in 1988, in Halifax,
 Yorkshire, the band originally set out as a standard death metal style
 band, all brutal riffs, speed and attitude. But by the time of their 1990
 self-titled debut, they had already ditched the lyrical touchstones of the
 genre for a distinctly arty approach to their existential misery. Chief
 architect in this was vocalist Nick Holmes, whose dour and reflective vocal
 style was infinitely more suited to lyrics of depth and bleakness.
 Keyboards - a definite faux pas for a thrash band! - became more integral
 to their gothic musings and by the time of 1995's 'Draconian Times', they
 were rapidly starting to sound like a very heavy metal Depeche Mode.
 It was 1997's lush and seductive 'One Second' that really clinched the
 transformation, however. Its sleek, dark compositions, featuring electronic
 touches and layers of orchestrated guitars and strings, was a glorious goth
 metal journey through the shaded workings of Holmes' psyche. By the time
 of 'Host', Paradise Lost had established themselves as one of the most
 innovative metal bands of the '90s.

 PEARL JAM

 Not many bands can claim to being formed as a result of a serious accident
 and Seattle's Pearl Jam probably come closest to this unlikely scenario.
 The accident in question was the unfortunate demise of Mother Love Bone
 singer Andrew Wood. His long-time friend Soundgarden's Chris Cornell put
 together a tribute project called Temple Of The Dog, during which time the
 various members of the would-be Pearl Jam got roped in to perform their
 parts. With the TOTD project in the can it seemed natural for the various
 members - including Eddie Vedder (vocals), Stone Gossard (guitar), Mike
 McCready (guitar) and Jeff Ament (bass) - to continue playing while Chris
 Cornell returned to @{"Soundgarden" link "SOUNDGARDEN"}. The result was the birth of a modern rock
 phenomenon. The grunge wave was just peaking at the time and Pearl Jam's
 troubled lyrics fitted in well with grunge's complaining punk vibe.
 The music was, however, more akin to rock of the old school bringing to
 mind the firey guitar work of such musical giants as Jimi Hendrix. 1992's
 'Ten' was a massive hit, giving the band a number of MTV supported singles,
 and follow-ups 'Vs' and 'Vitalogy' introduced more than a hint of punk
 anger. This was doubtless the period that gave the band their best loved
 songs, as they took on the corporate might of the Ticketmaster booking
 agency and indulged their every creative whim with a series of diverse
 side projects roping in the likes of Neil Young (for 'Mirror Ball') along
 the way. More recently their star status has allowed Pearl Jam to release
 albums with less frequency and their output, while always intriguing, has
 never quite matched the melodic accessibility and passion of their early
 work.

 POISON

 Could these super-sleazy kings of bouffant hair be single-handedly
 responsible for depletion of the ozone layer through excessive hairspray
 usage? Possibly, judging by their ridiculously glammed up publicity photos
 of the mid 80s. And to be fair, that was all Bret Michaels (vocals),
 CC DeVille (guitar), Bobby Dall (bass) and Rikki Rockett (drums) ever
 wanted when they formed in 1984 - to be adored. With immaculate timing
 Poison's brainless bubble gum metal hit the spot of a nation still reeling
 from the glitzy successes of bands like @{"Motley Crue" link "MOTLEY CRUE"} and @{"Ratt" link "RATT"}.
 1986's 'Look What The Cat Dragged In' sounded absurdly dumb in places but
 there was no denying the exuberant fun of hits like 'Talk Dirty To Me' and
 its accompanying video. Almost as soon as they had been accepted as
 pop-rockers they decided that longevity lay with being taken seriously and
 1988's 'Open Up And Say...Aah!' contained its fair share of throwaway hits
 and the mega-ballad 'Every Rose Has It's Thorn', a sort of sub @{"Bon Jovi" link "BON JOVI"}
 strum-along bringing to mind lonesome, lovelorn cowboys. With 'Flesh And
 Blood' and 'Native Tongue' in the early 90s the band were straining to
 look credible when all anyone ever wanted them to do was churn out pop
 hits. Since they split and began dabbling in various side projects

 Primus are a challenge to any lover of great music; there is no doubt that
 the band harbour great talent, but they persist in being wilfully,
 deliberately avant garde when it comes to writing songs. In short, they
 don't. Primus formed back in 1984, but they were always more about
 bassist/vocalist/songwriter Les Claypool's talent than anything else.
 They took the musical prowess of, say, @{"Rush" link "RUSH"} and threw in a whole load
 of Frank Zappa style zaniness to create a bass-popping monster, with
 Claypool's bizarre nasal twang adding that final sonic twist. They didn't
 so much write songs as noodle around with arrangements for a joke.
 At first, they were, naturally, cult heroes, but by early '90s, they had
 developed a reputation to the point where 1993's 'Pork Soda' actually made
 it into the US album charts at No. 10. More recently, their albums 'Tales
 From The Punch Bowl', 'The Brown Album' and 'Antipop' have all turned them
 into bizarre musical stars. Their reputation for overt daffiness even
 landed them the job of creating a theme for hit comedy series 'South Park'.

 PRODIGY

 The fusion of rap, rock and hip hop may be a relatively standard feature
 of many of today's bands, but not many outfits have successfully adapted
 to more recent popular cultural groundshifts such as rave and techno music.
 The Prodigy, however, have straddled both dance and rock camps with some
 ease over recent years. Starting off in the Essex clubbing heartland back
 in the very early 90s, Liam Howlett was busy demoing material from his
 bedroom. With dancers Leeroy Thornhill and Keith Flint on board and Maxim
 providing some much needed MC talent, they had an underground hit with
 'What Evil Lurks' before 'Charly' - a single based on samples of an old
 public information film - became a top ten hit. At this point the outfit
 were exclusively dance orientated and 'The Prodigy Experience' was a
 massive hit on the rave scene. Howlett - incidentally, the only one of the
 four actually signed as the Prodigy - was already bored by the limited
 scope provided by dance and began to incorporate a more metallic direction
 into 1994's 'Music For The Jilted Generation'. The rockier sensibilities
 fused to the almost punk-like aggression of the beats gave the band a tough
 modern sound quite unlike anything in the charts at the time. By 1996 the
 rock crossover was complete with the release of single 'Firestarter',
 which was stamped with Keith Flint's vocal and visual persona - the video
 showed the dancer in full-on punk freak mode - and ensured the band courted
 plenty of vital publicity. The claustrophobic single 'Breathe' followed and
 the album 'The Fat Of The Land' proved to be a revelation of styles and,
 above all, attitude. Here was music born of the latest anti-authoritarian
 musical movement adapting the styles and focus of punk for the new
 millennium. Howlett, however, ever concerned that the Prodigy should not
 become diluted by over-exposure announced they would cease to exist once
 they had finished touring with the Lollapalooza festival line-up. For the
 time being, at least, the Prodigy appear to be on ice.

 QUEEN

 A totally original and unique rock act, Queen not only brought a great
 amount of gut-level energy to their sound through guitarist Brian May's
 distinctive signature sound, but in singer Freddie Mercury they had a
 flamboyant and completely irreplaceable showman. At times whimsical and
 deliberately off the wall Queen were, nevertheless, a superb heavy rock
 band combining considerable power with a very commercial sense of song
 and melody. First coming to prominence in the mid 70s Queen had actually
 formed in 1970 but had assiduously concentrated on building up a live
 reputation. The 'Seven Seas Of Rhye' single proved to be the breakthrough
 in 1974 and the album it came from - the imaginatively titled 'Queen II'
 - led to the band's classic period as with follow-ups 'Sheer Heart Attack'
 and 'A Night At The Opera' they defied expectation by not only being
 stupendously heavy but by throwing in a number of jokes along with
 accomplished classical and operatic flourishes. The latter album is most
 notable for giving the world of music one of it's best-loved tracks in the
 faux operatic 'Bohemian Rhapsody', a single that also kickstarted the
 videos phenomenon through its innovative promo clip. Subsequent LPs
 featured some fine moments and, bar a dubious disco phase with 'Hot Space'
 at the start of the 80s, for much of the big-haired rock decade Queen were
 immensely popular especially after their stunning Live Aid appearance in
 1985. Sadly, by the late 80s rumours about Mercury's poor health were
 beginning to circulate and in 1991 the larger-than-life showman died of
 AIDS. The following year's star-studded tribute concert at Wembley Stadium
 was a testament both to the band's popularity and the esteem in which the
 man was held.

 QUEENSRYCHE

 The Seattle scene may have been most recently the home of grunge, but in
 the mid '80s, the predominant sound was metal. But not just any kind of
 metal for Geoff Tate (vocals), Chris De Garmo (guitar), Michael Wilton
 (guitar), Eddie Jackson (bass) and Scott Rockenfield (drums) - theirs was
 a titanic, futuristic style of rock, which borrowed heavily from sci-fi
 and fantasy, particularly the '80s 'Mad Max' phenomenon. Hence, after
 releasing their eponymous debut EP and a solid but unexciting debut
 called 'The Warning', Queensryche suddenly found themselves persuaded to
 done the most preposterously over-the-top outfits in an attempt to add
 a suitably visual dimension to their hysterically overblown sound.
 Fortunately, the big hair, make-up and wide-load shoulder pads didn't last
 long, but the music was another matter entirely. With 'Rage For Order',
 they experimented with a gleamingly polished production and with 1988's
 'Operation: Mindcrime', they did the unthinkable: they created a masterly
 metallic concept album that wasn't just good - it was terrific. In fact,
 it was more than that, it was a classic with its story line of revolution,
 futuristic dystopias and evil megalomaniac professors. Follow up 'Empire'
 aspired to equally great heights, as did subsequent less successful albums.
 Most recently, the band have been re-grouping and re-defining themselves
 following the departure of key songwriter De Garmo shortly before the
 recording of their latest album 'Q2K'.

 QUICKSAND

 To most people hardcore is simply about lots of shouting over a barely
 competent musical background, but to New York's Quicksand it was always
 a springboard into deeply heartfelt lyrical sentiments - about love, loss,
 childhood, politics - firmly harnessed to a more progress sense of melody
 and song structure. When the band first formed in the late 80s the line-up
 consisted of true hardcore veterans: vocalist/guitarist Walter Schreifels
 had been a member of Youth Of Today and the legendary Gorilla Biscuits,
 guitarist Tom Capone had been a member of Bold, bassist Sergio Vega had
 been a member of Absolution, and drummer Alan Cage had been a member of
 Beyond. With these punk and hardcore credentials it was natural for the
 band to churn out the hardest, heaviest music they could, but Quicksand
 rapidly became noted not just for their power but their subtlety. Theirs
 was a more groove-based sound, often likened to Helmet for its heaviness.
 Their constant touring in the early 90s with the likes of Helmet, Rage
 Against The Machine, and Fugazi ironically led to them signing to major
 label Polydor and a fine debut album in 'Slip'. The textures of the debut
 were expanded upon with 1995 follow-up 'Manic Compression', an all together
 more complex record which stretched hardcore's generic sound to the limit.
 Though the band seemed to run out of steam and split for a while to pursue
 other musical goals, they reconvened in 1998 and toured with the @{"Deftones" link "DEFTONES"},
 promising that an album would follow.

 Some bands are destined to be of interest because of who used to play in
 their ranks rather than for any major musical merit of their own, and so
 it is with these LA rockers, who originally formed in the '70s but enjoyed
 their success in the '80s. The band had always had commercial leanings to
 their glitzy hard rock sound and in the '70s they were fortunate enough to
 enjoy the talents of a remarkably talented guitarist: Randy Rhoads. The two
 albums Rhoads featured on are highly prized now by collectors and by all
 accounts, this legendary guitarist's talents are very much in evidence.
 Rhoads, however, famously jumped ship to join @{"Ozzy Osbourne" link "OZZY OSBOURNE"}'s band in
 1979, and Quiet Riot were left to remould themselves, which they duly did,
 and proceeded to enjoy the most successful period of their careers.
 They brought in a touch more melody, threw in a belting chorus or two and
 came back with 1983's 'Metal Health', which hit the No. 1 spot and sold
 over 5 million copies on the back of some sparky singles action, not least
 their crackling cover of the old Slade classic 'Cum On Feel The Noize'.
 It was a remarkable feat of re-engineering, but the momentum didn't last,
 and, though subsequent albums sold respectably, they never attained the
 same degree of success. The band split in 1988, but vocalist Kevin DuBrow
 has attempted too resuscitate Quiet Riot a couple of times since.

 Some bands have to slog around for years before they make their mark either

 gold in both senses virtually from their inception. Formed in 1992 by
 Zack de la Rocha (vocals), Tom Morello (guitar), Timmy C (bass) and
 Brad Wilk (drums), they took the fashionable tenets of hip-hop and rap,
 threw in some wild funk and blasted it all out in proud heavy metal
 fashion. It was a sound and style which hit its mark with unnerving
 accuracy. Their self-titled 1993 album was a howling tirade of abuse
 and fury aimed at authority in whatever guise that may appear and struck
 a chord with the disaffected and alienated the world over. Chief among the
 rabble-rousing anthems was the expletive-strewn 'Killing In The Name',
 which soon had moral guardians calling for them to be banned. Adding more
 fuel to the fire of controversy were singles 'Bullet In The Head' and
 'Bombtrack'. Following this period, the band spent time aligning themselves
 with various worthy causes, proving that when it came to protest, they were
 a lot more than just mouth pieces for empty political rhetoric. Still, all
 this activity outside the studio mean that it was 1996 before 'Evil Empire'
 emerged, and another three before 'The Battle Of Los Angeles'.
 Nevertheless, both albums proved that when it came to self-belief and

 One of the definitive hard rock bands of the '70s, Rainbow was actually

 for himself that he could control himself. Elf had supported Purple on
 a previous tour and their frontman, @{"Ronnie James Dio" link "DIO"}, was a man with
 a voice tailor-made for metallic opera. All Blackmore did, in effect,
 was to hire all of Elf... except their guitarist! Under the catchy name
 Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, they released a self-titled debut in 1975
 and with the guitarist's classic leanings and Dio's love of fantasy lyrics,
 a classic was born. Trimming the name to a more pronounceable Blackmore's
 Rainbow, the world got 'Rainbow Rising' in 1976, one of rock's finest
 albums featuring stage faves like 'Tarot Woman' and the epic 'Stargazer'.
 1978's 'Long Live Rock 'N' Roll' proved to be the last album Dio would
 appear on. In fact, several other band members also found themselves on
 the wrong end of Blackmore's notorious perfectionism - or should that be
 irascible moodiness? Whatever, with new singer Graham Bonnet, the revamped
 line-up enjoyed their greatest commercial period as 'Down To Earth' brought
 Top 10 hits with 'Since You've Been Gone' and 'All Night Long'. And then
 Blackmore decided things still weren't right and Joe Lynn Turner found
 himself as vocalist for 1981's 'Difficult To Cure', which contained hit
 single 'I Surrender'. However, by this point, Blackmore was trying to make
 the band a slicker, tighter, melodic hard rock band, rather than the
 neo-classic outfit it had originally been. 'Straight Between The Eyes'
 and 'Bent Out Of Shape' were fine in themselves, but couldn't match the

 In German Rammstein literally means a battering ram. A ram made of rock.
 Very appropriate when you consider what this intense sextet from East
 Germany actually sound like. Formed in 1993 the band quickly developed
 a unique voice similar in some ways to the marching metallic thunder of,
 say, KMFDM, which principally piled layers of regimented guitar over
 a rigidly pumping rhythm section finished off with the baritone operatic
 growl of singer Till Lindemann. The fact that Lindemann was once an Olympic
 class swimmer might explain where he gets such awesome lung power.
 In addition to the intimidating potency of the music Rammstein also
 incorporated elements of perverse theatrics into their set. It wouldn't be
 unusual for Lindemann to sing his bizarre tales of lost love while totally
 on fire. This provocative combination of freak art and rock 'n' roll was at
 the focus of debut LP 1995's 'Herzeleid' (Heartache), a record strange
 enough to attract the attention of film maker David Lynch who was suitably
 impressed enough to include two tracks in his Lost Highway film.
 The industrially stark discipline of the Rammstein sound was even more
 pronounced on follow-up 'Sehnsucht' (Longing) which entered the German
 chart at number one and almost repeated the feat in Switzerland and
 Austria. Strangely, doubtless helped by MTV, the Rammstein phenomenon
 also appears to be gathering pace in America where the band's overt blend

 a punk sound - complete with touches of '60s pop (which they loved) - that
 would heavily influence the world of rock pretty much for ever.
 They specialised in short, sharp, shocking blasts of buzz saw guitars,
 lyrics that dealt with some of the dumbest subjects you could possibly

 the @{"Sex Pistols" link "SEX PISTOLS"} (they were apparently Sid Vicious' favourite band) to

 such classics as 'Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue' and 'Blitzkrieg Bop' with
 its chantalong 'Hey ho let's go!' refrain. Every single album that followed
 stuck rigidly to this philosophy: make 'em dumb, make 'em catchy, make 'em
 fast. In fact, on stage the songs were played even faster. The years ticked
 by and the Ramones continued to turn out the classics, although their '70s

 Sleaze, glamour, spandex, hair - welcome to the superficial world of LA's

 the line-up of singer Stephen Pearcy, guitarists Robbin Crosby and Warren
 DeMartini, bassist Juan Croucier and drummer Bobby Blotzer would go on to
 major success in the glitzy '80s. Typically, a self-financed eponymous
 debut led to a major deal and 1984's 'Out Of The Cellar', a huge hard
 rock success with single 'Round And Round' securing the band airplay on
 radio-playlists across America. They were at their best during this period,
 with basically every single song concentrating on the business of sex and
 fun. Follow-up 'Invasion Of Your Privacy' (1985) delivered more of the same
 and turned the band into arena-filling superstars. Into the late '80s,
 the Ratt formula continued virtually unchanged with a relatively constant
 level of success, even though the critics began to pan everything the band
 did. On the one hand, Ratt were shallow and limited, but on the other,
 they satisfied a craving for instantly catchy pop rock tunes.

 RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS

 Funk and punk - an unlikely combination of genres, but one which this
 bunch of Hollywood reprobates would make their own, virtually creating
 a genre in itself and spawning thousands of imitators who wanted to
 groove with the same degree of aplomb. Originally conceived back in 1983,
 their first self-titled album was a curious hotch-potch of sleazy funk
 and shin-chewing punk which suffered from the fact that, for reasons far
 too complicated to explain here, only two of the real band members were
 present for the recordings - singer Anthony Keidis and bass monster Flea!
 1985's 'Freaky Styley' was far more successful with production duties
 being handled by the arch-funkmeister himself George Clinton. But these
 relatively smooth and funky sounds were revved up to a sexually charged
 maximum with subsequent albums, most notably 'Mother's Milk' and their
 all-time classic 'Blood sugar sex magik' (1991). With the latter, they
 achieved their intention of creating a full-blooded, pumping, funk punk
 hybrid, featuring both their sensitive side ('Under the Bridge') and their
 debauched side ('Suck My Kiss'). It was a triumph which would overshadow
 their subsequent albums, even though the quality was always high.
 Most recently, 1999's 'Californication' has seen the band reach new highs,

 a style best described, rather loosely, as a kind of art rock. Their
 initial forays into lyric writing involved basic fantasy themes, but with
 Peart's love of literature and all things scientific and intellectual, the
 songs eventually began to reflect his interests. Musically, also, they were
 unparalleled for their dedication and professionalism, a fact which was
 borne out consistently by their epic concept pieces, most notably the
 brilliant '2112' album. In fact, it was this peak period of the '70s and
 '80s that best marked out the band's talents. 1977's 'A Farewell To Kings',
 1978's epic 'Hemispheres', 1981's punchy, hard rocking 'Moving Pictures'
 - all these, and the albums in between, show a band capable of both
 stunning musical performances and almost endless amounts of invention.
 Rush have now, understandably, reached the point where they can ease off
 in terms of work rate, and do pretty much whatever they want musically.
 But whenever a Rush album is expected, the event is always momentous and
 fascinating.

 SAMMY HAGAR

 These days, curly-haired all-American boy Sammy Hagar is best known for
 doing the nigh on impossible and stepping into the enormous empty shoes
 left by @{"David Lee Roth" link "DAVID LEE ROTH"} when he agreed to front @{"Van Halen" link "VAN HALEN"} back in 1985.
 This remarkably successful period of rock history aside, Hagar's career
 actually stretches back to the early '70s and a couple of stonking albums
 he recorded with Montrose where in he was the vocalist, and writer of some
 of the best songs the band had in their set. 'Montrose' (1973) and 'Paper
 Money' (1974) contained such Hagar-attributed classics as 'Bad Motor
 Scooter', 'Rock The Nation' and 'Space Station No. 5'. With his ability
 to pen superbly powerful rock songs proven, he went solo in 1975 and made
 eight studio albums, beginning with the cheekily titled 'Nine On A Ten
 Scale'. Commercial success was elusive at first, but then finally arrived
 with '79's 'Street Machine', which, true to type, featured yet more songs
 about cars, girls, cars, love, and, erm, did we forget to mention the cars?
 He even wrote a song about his beloved Trans Am! During the period right up
 to his joining Van Halen, he was well-known but it was this amazing career
 move that actually made his name on a global scale.

 SAXON

 Some bands just will not die, and the honest-to-goodness metal ethic
 espoused by this tough outfit from Barnsley, Yorkshire, is a testament
 to their undying love of rock music. Originally formed as Son Of A Bitch,
 Saxon came to prominence during the late '70s and early '80s as one of
 the chief bands at the vanguard of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal.
 There was nothing fancy about their down 'n' dirty brand of rock, it was
 all about girls, rock 'n' roll and excitement - the lyrics were often
 ridiculous, but you couldn't faults the ballsy riffing provided by
 guitarists Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver. Their no-nonsense style was
 stamped all the way through such wondrous albums as 'Wheels Of Steel',
 'Strong Arm Of The Law' and 'Denim And Leather'. It was a simple template,
 but one that would influence literally thousands of copyists.
 Arguably at their peak in the early '80s, their attempts at cracking
 America led them to experiment with a smoother sound, and with the
 invention of thrash metal, they found themselves somewhat alienated.
 This led to a general decline in their fortunes, although they have
 continued to churn out the albums - with a notably tougher sound than
 some of the late '80s fare - and continue touring to this day.

 SCORPIONS

 For all their love of metal, it's a little odd to think that Germany has
 only produced one lasting world-ranking rock band: the mighty Scorpions.
 Originally formed in 1971, this Teutonic outfit began by dabbling in all
 things psychedelic to varying degrees of success, but they gradually
 shifted away from those roots to become one of Germany's premier metal
 acts. Beginning with 1976's 'Virgin Killers' (and its extremely dubious
 sleeve art - a feature they would become noted for), they headed down the
 road of revved up axes and chunky hard rock. The very peak of this period
 is best displayed by the headbanging fury of 1979's 'Lovedrive' and 1980's
 'Animal Magnetism', both of them housed in suitably strange sleeve art yet
 again. What made this lot so successful was their unerring ear for a hooky
 tune, but, most importantly, the ability to ram the point home with no
 uncertain degree of enthusiasm. Their infectious energy was always apparent
 in concert, and live albums like 'Tokyo Tapes' and 'World Wide Live' are
 a testament to this fact. What truly broke the band on a global scale,
 however, was the, frankly surprising, 'Wind Of Change' hit single, complete
 with whistling solo! To this day, the band continue to tour and record,
 though with less success after the advent of grunge.

 SCREAMING TREES

 Always lumped in with the Seattle grunge crew, in reality, this very fine
 rock band were formed and based in Ellensburg, Washington. They were also
 very little to do with grunge - they just happened to be in the area when
 it all happened. They had actually formed back in 1985 and brought together
 a variety of influences ranging from '60s psychedelia and punk through to
 heavy metal and, dare we suggest, a hint of blues and country. The latter
 aspects can be seen shining through on singer Mark Lanegan's superlative
 solo work, but when they first began, his morose lyrical phrasing and the
 band's wall of riffs fitted in quite nicely with the alienation of grunge.
 Three solid albums passed before their Chris Cornell (@{"Soundgarden" link "SOUNDGARDEN"})
 produced 'Uncle Anaeasthesia' (1991), and it all suddenly made sense.
 The songs were lush, powerful, passionate and appeared to plumb the very
 pits of despair - this was beauty found in mental and spiritual anguish.
 With time taken out to pursue solo projects, 1996's gorgeous 'Dust' was,
 eventually, the perfect amalgamation of all their disparate elements;
 there were splashes of '60s and '70s style rock, touches of country,
 tales of sin and redemption. Since then, the band have effectively been
 in suspended animation with Lanegan seemingly the most industrious as he
 continues to record diverse and soulful rock records in grand style.

@node "SEPULTURA"

 SEPULTURA

 Possibly the only world class thrash band to emerge from Brazil, Sepultura
 were one hell of a noisy crew when they formed in 1984, in Belo Horizonte.
 Their initial line-up featured brothers Igor (drums) and Max Cavalera
 (guitar/vocals), along with Jairo T and Paulo Jnr (bass), and they were
 immensely influenced by the likes of @{"Metallica" link "METALLICA"}, @{"Venom" link "VENOM"} and @{"Slayer" link "SLAYER"}.
 In fact, they borrowed wholesale from the latter and rapidly made a name
 for themselves as the fastest, most brutally aggressive thrash band on the
 continent, with songs steeped in cod satanic imagery at this time and
 themes of horror and insanity running throughout.
 Debut album 'Morbid Visions' (1986) was solid, but uninspiring, and
 'Schizophrenia' did little to dispel the idea that they were copyists.
 With new guitarist Andreas Kisser replacing Jairo T, however, the band
 gradually began to develop into a seriously talented outfit. 1989's
 'Beneath The Remains' took on more of a political flavour as Max began
 exercising his lyrical brains beyond demons and devils.
 With 'Arise' (1991) and 'Chaos AD' (1993), the band effectively paved the
 way for what would be their finest, most diverse work. Already hints of
 tribal rhythms and experimentation were prevalent, but in 1996, they
 shocked the world of metal with the raw splendour of 'Roots'. It featured
 plenty of guitar and vocal violence, but the inclusion of traditional
 Brazilian percussive elements and instrumentation made it truly unique.
 In addition, the aggressive and bass-heavy grind they had been developing
 was finally perfected, a style which has been adopted wholesale by many
 so-called nu-metal bands. Although Max has now split off from the rest of
 the band to form his own outfit @{"Soulfly" link "SOULFLY"}, Sepultura continue to record and
 tour with new singer Derrick Green.

@node "SEX PISTOLS"

 SEX PISTOLS

 Were they created by manager Malcolm McLaren or would they have happened
 anyway? This type of question has been brought up time after time when
 trying to analyse the shocking punk phenomenon that was the Sex Pistols.
 Ultimately, though, who cares? The fact remains that, for a short period
 of time, Johnny Rotten (vocals), Steve Jones (guitar), Paul Cook (drums)
 and first Glen Matlock, then Sid Vicious (bass), were the most important
 rock band in the world. Their influence can be seen in everyone from
 @{"Guns N' Roses" link "GUNS N' ROSES"} to @{"Nirvana" link "NIRVANA"}. They only recorded one album, the all-time punk
 classic 'Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols', but with this
 single record to their name, they changed the face of modern music forever.
 It was a raucous, toxic, gleefully rebellious record simply brimming over
 with bile and poison. It gave them a number of UK hit singles and succeeded
 in getting them banned just about everywhere they tried to play. Perhaps
 the most salient point to make about a band with such a small body of work,
 but with such a huge influence, is that they were, effectively, the focal
 point of a nation in crisis. The wasteland of mid-'70s Britain was a bleak
 place to be if you were a teenager and the music scene seemed to be
 populated with bloated rock star gods who were very far removed from
 the fans that elevated them to that status. The Pistols cut through this
 bullshit, questioned authority and made enemies out of just about anyone
 they crossed paths with - including several record companies, who actually
 paid the band to get them off their labels. Inevitably, with such
 a volatile bunch of musicians, and Sid Vicious' spiralling heroin
 addiction, the band were destined to self-destruct in spectacular
 fashion. And they did so while on tour in the US in 1978.

 Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and anyone listening to
 Australia's silverchair wouldn't be far off the mark in assuming that
 school friends Daniel Johns (guitar/vocals), Chris Joannu (bass), and
 Ben Gillies (drums) had more than a passing acquaintance with the Seattle
 grunge scene. The actual story behind the band is the stuff of fairy tales;
 three friends win a national radio station competition and the prize is
 a recording session. This led to a hit single, and fame beckoned with their
 first album 1995's 'Frogstomp'; the band were still at school and they were
 rock stars already, with their parents as managers. The remarkable thing
 about 'Frogstomp' was its very professional and imitative qualities.
 While it was true that the band owed a great deal to their parents' old
 record collections (they used to practise old @{"Black Sabbath" link "BLACK SABBATH"} and @{"Deep Purple" link "DEEP PURPLE"}
 songs when rehearsing), the angsty, downtuned metallic grind was immensely
 reminiscent of the Seattle sound. The clinching factor was Johns'
 remarkable, though allegedly unintentional, Eddie Vedder (@{"Pearl Jam" link "PEARL JAM"}) -
 style vocals. Needless to say, their re-creation of this already familiar
 sound made a huge impact on the US, and 1997's 'Freak Show' did nothing to
 dispel the comparisons with @{"Nirvana" link "NIRVANA"}. Even their choice of song titles -
 'Abuse Me', 'Slave', 'Freak' - seemed to ape the grungers. The band's most
 recent record - 1999's 'Neon Ballroom' - has been something of a surprise,
 with a hitherto unexpected degree of maturity and musical variety marking
 out a definite path for the future.

 SKID ROW

 The story of New Jersey band Skid Row's entry into the world of rock is
 something of a legend now. Originally guitarist Dave 'Snake' Sabo and
 @{"Jon Bon Jovi" link "BON JOVI"} grew up together and they vowed that should one of them hit
 the big time in show biz he would come back and give the other a little
 help. Bon Jovi, of course, became mega stars and so Jon duly helped his
 mate's fledgling outfit get started. Had he not helped, however, it's
 highly likely that Skid Row would have got there in the end. Not only did
 they have some fantastically melodic and super-tough rock songs, they also
 possessed hyperactive wunderkind Sebastian Bach on vocals. Songs like
 'Youth Gone Wild' could have been penned with Sebastian in mind and it was
 with tunes like this that their eponymous 1989 debut was packed. Theirs was
 the sound of disaffected youth channeled into music but they also knew the
 value of a good pop tune when they released the likes of ballad 'I Remember
 You'. Their uncompromising nature led to a super-heavy follow-up, 1991's
 'Slave To The Grind', which surprisingly eschewed the commercial path laid
 down by their debut and opted instead for balls-out fury. The punk
 influence evident before finally made itself known in no uncertain terms
 when the @{"Sex Pistols" link "SEX PISTOLS"}' 'Holidays In The Sun' backed a single release of
 'Wasted Time'. Sadly, however, with such a promising start third album
 'Subhuman Race' took a long time arriving (it emerged in 1995) and interest
 in the band fizzled out.

 SKUNK ANANSIE

 Not many rock bands can claim to being successful when it comes to
 political polemic but London band Skunk Anansie can not only claim to be
 successful in that arena but also in terms of artistic creativity and
 commerciality. No mean feat for such a young band. Formed in 1994 by
 Skin (vocals), Ace (guitars), Cass (bass) and Robbie (drums) their
 confrontational style and street-level polemics dealing with everything
 from racism, to personal relationships, to the hypocrisies of organised
 religion landed them a record deal almost immediately. Key to the band's
 spiraling success was Skin's ability to inject virtually every syllable
 with either passion or rage or, most often, both. Not only that but the
 band could also switch into a softer more soulful mode when the mood
 suited them too. This artistic flexibility was very much to the fore with
 1995's debut, the staggeringly accomplished 'Sunburnt And Paranoid',
 a potent combination of sweet but barbed ballads such as 'Charity' and
 'Pity', along with more straight ahead rockers such as 'Selling Jesus
 Again'. Almost immediately the band made friends with the singles charts.
 Follow-ups 'Stoosh' and 'Post Orgasmic Chill' extended the band's obvious
 commercial aspects with yet another brace of powerful singles, but their
 obvious radio-friendly aspects were still acutely balanced against their
 more abrasive and uncompromising side.

 SLAYER

 For some the pinnacle of thrash always was, and always will be, represented
 by the infernal tornado of noise that is Slayer in full, dark flight.
 Formed in Los Angeles in 1981 the classic line-up consisted of Tom Araya
 (bass/vocals), Kerry King (guitar), Jeff Hanneman (guitar) and drummer
 Dave Lombardo. They came together with only one intention in mind: to be
 the fastest, sickest, heaviest metal band on the face of the planet.
 And some would argue they still are. At first their sub-@{"Venom" link "VENOM"} black metal
 stylings were rather lamentable but as their perfectionism grew their
 ability to stun and outrage grew also. Their 'Haunting The Chapel' EP
 (1984) went some way to making their reputation with its blistering thrash
 attack. But their mean-spirited bluster found its full expression on 1985's
 'Hell Awaits', an intense overtly Satanic slab of metal. It got them a deal
 with legendary Def Jam records and producer Rick Rubin was at the helm of
 their finest record to date, an album which has influenced countless
 pretenders to the throne of thrash ever since: 'Reign In Blood'.
 It was less than forty minutes in length but each one of those minutes was
 packed with more poison and spite than most bands can muster over an entire
 career. Fans loved it, the moral guardians hated it. A legend was born.
 Subsequent releases have found the band experimenting more with pace and
 dynamics but still at the core of albums such as 'South Of Heaven' and
 'Seasons In The Abyss' lies a perennial fascination with brutal, naked
 speed and the satanic occult.

 SLIPKNOT

 Up to now Des Moines, Iowa, couldn't really claim to be of any major
 significance in terms of rock and metal until the ear-bleeding tornado
 of noise that is Slipknot came into existence, that is. Back in 1995 the
 band's line-up was very fluid but it didn't take long for the current
 line-up to take shape. Everything about Slipknot is an attempt to pervert
 that natural balance of things, to upset and offend by deliberately not
 conforming to the norm. To this end the band settled on nine members -
 DJ Sid Wilson, drummer Joey Jordison, bassist Paul Gray, percussionist
 Chris Fehn, guitarist Jim Root, sampler Craig Jones, percussionist
 Shawn Crahan, guitarist Mick Thomson, and vocalist Corey Taylor -
 insisting that this was the optimum set-up for the Slipknot aural crusade.
 What's more they decided to wear boiler suits and each band member adopted
 a mask of their own choice to make themselves as anonymous as possible on
 stage, making the music the prime focus at all times. Of course, this
 visual aspect of the band would be meaningless were it not backed up by
 something truly incredible. Through their constant rehearsal and touring
 the Slipknot sound has developed into a full-blown tirade of hip hop, death
 metal, and rap, all of it brought into sharp focus through the tightly
 orchestrated percussive onslaught. Their self-released debut, 1996's 'Mate,
 Feed, Kill, Repeat', attracted the attention of thrash producer
 Ross Robinson and the result was their self-titled debut which has been
 astonishing metal fans (and pretty much everyone else!) the world over.

 Max have to deal with losing touch with the band that he formed with his

 insecurity was to engross himself in music - hence the creation of Max's
 next project, Soulfly. Taking off where he had left Sepultura, the sound
 Max aimed for was just as heavy and just as tribal - capitalising on the
 traditional Brazilian instrumentation used on Sepultura's groundbreaking
 'Roots' album - but also included touches of experimentation hitherto
 unexplored. One particularly bruising song, 'Bumba', for instance,
 utilised samples and was co-produced by Mario Caldato Jr who had

 Never really a grunge band as such, Soundgarden did, nevertheless, form
 in Seattle but their more overtly metallic brand of alternative rock found
 them sitting ill at ease among the new generation of slacker rock. After
 all they had actually been around since 1984 and had very little to do
 with the misery of Generation X, even though their style of music was
 loaded with melancholic power. No, for singer Chris Cornell and crew -
 most notably ace guitarist Kim Thayil - the sound of @{"Black Sabbath" link "BLACK SABBATH"} was
 more of an inspiration and their love of psychedelia is also apparent on
 their 1988 debut 'Ultra Mega OK'. Thayil was a fine craftsman when it came
 to poetic riffs and the superlative musicianship clearly counterpointed
 Cornell's love of the bleak and desperate. 'Louder Than Love' was
 a superbly wrought follow up but with the angsty fire of 'Bad Motorfinger',
 Soundgarden's love of 70s style rock was given a thoroughly modern sheen
 and chart action resulted. This, however, was as nothing compared to the
 dark joys present on 'Superunknown' the album that contained such
 wondrously bleak songs as 'Fell On Black Days' and 'Black Hole Sun'.
 This was thinking man's rock, all introverted moods and subsumed passion.
 By the time of 1996's 'Down On The Upside' they had opened up a little
 - but not a lot - and the claustrophobic genius of early records was still
 in evidence. However, by this point internal friction eventually led to
 the band suddenly splitting in early 1997.

 Formed in 1984 Spinal Tap were the evil brainchild of a group of sharp

 any help from a bunch of comedy actors. Nevertheless, the group were given
 a full history by their creators and Nigel Tufnell, David St Hubbins and
 Derek Smalls were the names of the prime movers in the band. First coming
 to prominence in the 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap, the world of rock gave
 the film ample scope to truly put the steel toe-capped boot into the
 excesses and egos associated with rock. The ageing and failing rock group
 were portrayed as washed up has-beens incapable of telling when their star
 has waned and the set pieces were so accurate that anyone who was unaware
 of the spoof actually thought they were watching a real documentary.
 Pushing the joke even further Spinal Tap also released 'Break Like The
 Wind' in 1992 and preceded its release with the single 'Bitch School'.
 The album and inevitable tour obviously could not match the brilliance
 of the movie but they had their moments. Since then the band have been

 The roots of the band stretch all the way back to 1962 but it was the
 classic line-up of Francis Rossi (guitar/vocals), Alan Lancaster (bass),
 Rick Parfitt (guitar/vocals), and John Coghlan (drums) that recorded their
 first hit the psychedelic 'Pictures Of Matchstick Men' in 1967. It wasn't
 until 1970, however, that they actually began to adopt their hugely
 successful twelve-bar formula with the 'Dog Of Two Head' album. With this
 basic blueprint in mind the Quo boys merely piled on the energy and let
 loose a brace of commercially successful albums which appealed to just
 about everyone and their mothers - 'Piledriver', 'Hello', 'Quo', 'On The
 Level', they all spawned huge chart hits. And the band simply kept rocking
 all the way through punk, with a cover of John Fogerty's 'Rockin' All Over
 The World' topping the chart during 1977! Come the early 80s and a brief
 split led to Rossi and Parfitt being the only original members left, but
 still they trundled on with the hits flowing. While the 70s flavour of the
 band had definitely been hard rock, the 80s gradually turned into something
 all together more dreary signalled by the hideous 'In The Army Now' in

 the great @{"Joe Satriani" link "JOE SATRIANI"} back in the early 70s while playing in a variety of
 teenage rock outfits but his real break came when he joined Frank Zappa's
 band in the very early 80s. During this period he managed one solo effort
 in the shape of 'Flex-able', a diverse and original showcase of his guitar
 virtuosity. A brief spell in hard-rock legends Alcatrazz led first to
 ex-@{"Sex Pistol" link "SEX PISTOLS"} Johnny Lydon's Public Image Ltd then to a two album stint
 with @{"David Lee Roth" link "DAVID LEE ROTH"}. Finally the end of the 80s brought a dazzling display

 superb but ill-suited to such cock-rock shenanigans. While recording the
 latter he had begun work on his own solo project and when it emerged in
 1990 'Passion And Warfare' was a stunningly assured mix of technical
 precision and off-the-wall conceptual humour - clearly his time with
 Zappa had influenced him a great deal. With each successive album -
 'Sex & Religion', 'Alien Love Secrets', 'Fire Garden', 'The Ultra Zone'
 - Vai has attempted to bring different styles and flavours to his work

 As an example of what can happen when rock stars get their hands on too

 well. As ever the band's roots lie back in the mists of time when singer
 Scott Weiland and bassist Robert Deleo were dating the same girl.
 They naturally met and a partnership was struck which eventually became
 Stone Temple Pilots in 1991 with the addition of Robert's guitarist brother
 Dean and drummer Eric Ketz. At a time when grunge was at the height of
 fashion the Pilot's riff heavy melodies and driving punk attitude fitted
 directly into what people wanted and the band rapidly found themselves
 in the same company as @{"Alice In Chains" link "ALICE IN CHAINS"} and @{"Pearl Jam" link "PEARL JAM"}. 1992's 'Core'
 virtually made stars of them overnight with its tales of thwarted romance
 and youthful alienation. Follow-ups 'Purple' and 'Tiny Music Songs From The
 Vatican Gift Shop' provided more stunning MTV-friendly rock with splashes
 of psychedelia colouring the brazenly driving riffage. The band were hugely
 successful with their seemingly effortless mix of melody and heaviosity.
 But even as they appeared to be unconquerable heroes Weiland's drug
 dependency got him arrested and began a period of major uncertainty for the
 band. The rest of the band dabbled with side project Talk Show while he
 sorted himself out and eventually 1999 brought 'No. 4' and a brace of tight
 full tilt rockers mixed with more characteristically melodic material.
 And then Weiland blew it by violating his parole again! Where the band will

 Widely credited as having invented pomp rock this outfit from Chicago were

 'Lady' it signalled the birth of a melodic rock legend. Up to this point
 in the mid 70s the band had been forging a way forward with overblown
 arrangements and a more arty style of rock. With the addition of one
 Tommy Shaw (guitar/vocals) they found the perfect foil to keyboard player
 Denis DeYoung's poppier leanings. Not only that, but Shaw also had a very
 commercial ear when it came to writing and his gradual inclusion in the
 creative process garnered the band their most successful period to date.
 The arrangements were tight and melodic, the vocals were histrionic in
 their intensity - the radio loved them. The likes of 'The Grand Illusion'
 and 'Pieces Of Eight' from the late 70s ensured that Styx would be marked
 as one of the lasting creators of pomp. 1980's 'Cornerstone' gave them
 their first US number one with the super-slick and sugary sweet 'Babe',
 and 1981's 'Paradise Theater' actually went Top Ten in the UK as well!
 This was Styx's most successful period and they would never again match

 themselves in around the Venice area of California, back in the very early
 80s. Led by the characteristically bandana-wearing vocalist 'Cyco' Mike
 Muir, his sense of humour was always present throughout the punishing
 noise, even when he was addressing some very serious social and political
 issues. And although their initial releases were somewhat basic, live they
 were an immensely dynamic and powerful unit - in fact, their shows were so
 edgy they were often banned from playing because of the dangers posed by
 out-of-control crowds. This live intensity eventually translated to record
 properly in the mid 80s when the likes of 'Join The Army' (1987) introduced
 elements of thrash metal to their previously trebly hardcore, and as such
 they virtually invented the speed sub-genre of 'skate-punk'. Later albums
 such as 'Lights, Camera ... Revolution' and 'Suicidal For Life' all
 exemplify this gleefully rampant punk hybrid. The band has continued to
 broaden its scope (despite a brief hiatus in the mid 90s), eventually
 bringing elements of funk, and more traditional metal into the mix,
 and latest album 'Freedumb' proves that when it comes to longevity
 and real talent Suicidal are unique entities on the hardcore scene.

 SYSTEM OF A DOWN

 Could Armenia possibly be the least likely place to spawn a metal band of
 the nu persuasion? Stranger things have happened, but as far as musical
 oddities go then this LA-based band are one of the weirdest and most
 compelling of the fresh faces currently upsetting decent-living folk the
 world over. Back in the mid 90s Serj Tankian (vocals), Daron Malakian
 (guitar), Shavo Odadjian (bass) and John Dolmayan (drums) did what any
 fledgling band do: they hawked around a demo tape. The tape finally got
 them a deal, not least because their freakish sound and, frankly, demented
 live shows guaranteed they already had a major following on an underground
 but global scale. When their eponymous debut album was released in 1998 it
 became clear why the buzz about the band was so fervent. The band were,
 quite clearly, proud of their national heritage and the influence of their
 country's music filtered through theirs. Not that this meant dodgy folk
 metal, rather a series of songs that revelled in off-kilter melodies
 and spine-snapping time changes, all finished off with a torrent of
 bile-fuelled, righteous anger. Quite disturbing and quite unique.

 TED NUGENT

 One of the few guitarists who could actually get away with wearing
 a loincloth on stage - @{"Manowar" link "MANOWAR"} take note! - Ted Nugent is a 110%, red-meat
 eating, guitar-slinging, motor-mouthing nutcase. Famed for his love of
 hunting and complete lack of modesty when it comes to describing his own
 talents, Nugent actually started his career in 60s garage band the Amboy
 Dukes. By the time of the early 70s this had become Ted Nugent And The
 Amboy Dukes before the inevitable happened and he went solo in 1975.
 Vociferously anti-metal, Nugent considers himself a rock 'n' roller and
 when you consider his songwriting talents and accuracy with a rifle you
 can't really argue. The period of his most famous and influential work was
 doubtless the mid to late 70s when his macho posturing and unrestrained axe
 work gave the unsuspecting world the likes of 'Ted Nugent', 'Free For All',
 'Cat Scratch Fever' and the live masterpiece 'Double Live Gonzo'. He was
 lewd, dirty, and most definitely un-PC in just about everything he did.
 Sadly his desire to adopt a more mainstream sound resulted in a distinct
 lack of bite on subsequent releases, and he just seemed to run out of ideas
 as each album began to sound like a pale imitation of its predecessor.
 Fortunately he can still offend with the best of 'em in a live setting and
 his between song raps have lost none of their outrage value.

 TESTAMENT

 Whenever any pioneering wave of creativity crashes through the music scene
 there is always an inevitable second wave - usually the musicians who were
 just old enough to be influenced by their slightly more advanced elders.
 That doesn't mean they're unworthy of attention, merely that they needed
 an initial kick in the right direction. So it was with San Francisco's
 Testament when they formed in the mid 80s after being galvanised into
 action by the path being forged by Exodus, @{"Slayer" link "SLAYER"}, @{"Megadeth" link "MEGADETH"} and @{"Metallica" link "METALLICA"}.
 Called Legacy, when they originally formed, their love of the Metallica
 sound dogged them through their early days, but it is without doubt their
 nave but brutal early period that is remembered with greatest affection.
 Eventually their debut album took their original band name - 1987's
 'The Legacy' - and immediately they found themselves at the forefront of
 the so-called second wave with their speedy and precise attack. Support
 slots with the likes of @{"Anthrax" link "ANTHRAX"} helped cement them into metal fans'
 collective consciousness as one of the heaviest most technically proficient
 units in rock. 1988's 'The New Order' was an equally uncompromising slab of
 focused rage, making much of vocalist Chuck Billy's demented warbling and
 guitarists Alex Skolnick's and Eric Petersons rabid riffing. If anything
 the band became increasingly heavier with subsequent releases but after
 several line-up changes in the 90s their direction seemed a little muddled.
 Nevertheless, 1999 brought a new album in the shape of 'The Gathering'.

 THE BLACK CROWES

 Since their official inception in 1989, The Black Crowes have proved to be
 one of the most musically uncompromising and adventurous hard rock bands of
 recent years. With 99 per cent of the songs being written by brothers Rich
 (guitar) and Chris (vocals) Robinson, the Crowes' sound harks back to the
 '60 and '70s heyday of hard-rocking blues and bar-room boogie. Deep in the
 mix, you can hear everyone from the Allman Brothers and @{"Lynyrd Skynyrd" link "LYNYRD SKYNYRD"} to
 the Faces - good old-fashioned tales of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll served
 up with a hefty home-baked slice of southern-flavoured soul. Most recently,
 the band have been touring and recording with Jimmy Page, but their own
 inimitable style is best appreciated on their debut album 'Shake Your
 Money Maker' and the wonderful evocatively titled 'The Southern Harmony
 And Musical Companion' - the latter, incredibly, recorded in a single week.
 And then the band seemed to lose their way somewhat. Their speaking out
 against the corporate sponsorship of rock - famously leading to their
 dismissal from a @{"ZZ Top" link "ZZ TOP"} tour - was one thing, but they began to embrace
 a strangely directionless psychedelic trip with live jams that never seemed
 to end. Happily, this odd detour into self-indulgence was reined in in the
 studio and subsequent albums 'Amorica' and 'Three Snakes And One Charm'
 displayed a band not afraid to stretch and develop their beloved musical
 traditions. Their most recent album, 'By Your Side', has effectively
 banished the spectres of creative excess and is their tightest rocking
 set yet.

 Not enough credit is accorded to The Runaways, despite the fact that they
 were the first all-female rock band to achieve any kind of prominence.
 Some might argue that this was down to the cynical manipulations of band
 manager, producer and all-round music entrepreneur Kim Fowley. There is,
 however, a case to be made that Fowley would have got precisely nowhere had
 the girls actually been just talentless bimbos. As it stands The Runaways
 suffered a series of line-up changes over their four years of existence
 (1975-79) but proved to be the launch pad for the careers of both @{"Lita Ford" link "LITA FORD"}
 and Joan Jett, who went on to solo career stardom. As far as the music goes
 The Runaways specialised in hugely energetic slabs of pop metal, liberally
 sprinkled with glitter and glam undertones - the overall aim was to create
 a kind of female @{"Ramones" link "RAMONES"} and the music certainly had the required punky
 attitude and economical style. 1976's self-titled debut contained teen
 anthem 'Cherry Bomb' and was a rough 'n' ready statement of intent ably
 expounded upon by their superb 'Queens Of Noise' (1977). 'Waitin' For The
 Night' merely expanded on the themes of teen rebellion but by now the
 line-up problems were becoming insurmountable and the band split after
 releasing 'And Now ... The Runaways'.

 THE SMASHING PUMPKINS

 If any critic of heavy metal tries claiming that the genre is creatively
 bankrupt then they should be directed instantly to the sublime sounds of
 the incomparable The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed back in the late 80s in
 Chicago, by guitarists Billy Corgan and James Iha the band understandably
 fell into the growing grunge scene rather comfortably, what with their
 angsty vocals (courtesy of Corgan) and their heady wall-of-noise riffing.
 Deep within, however, lies a streak of psychedelia which has more in common
 with the rock bands of the 60s and 70s, and a an arty sensibility which has
 little to do with punk. These qualities were evident right from the opening
 strains of 'Gish', an album which brought them almost overnight success.
 It was with their following records that the Pumpkins would really forge
 ahead, however. 'Siamese Dream' was a perfect blend of emotive melody and
 diamond-hard rock, and gave them yet another commercial success. And with
 success comes pointless self-indulgence, or at least it would pointless
 were it not executed with such aplomb. 1995's 'Mellon Collie And The
 Infinite Sadness' was the Pumpkins' 'Physical Graffiti', a sprawling,
 epic, double album which defied expectation with each successive track.
 Inevitably subsequent albums would pale in comparison to 'Mellon Collie'
 and its mad genius excesses. 1998's 'Adore' was a foray into more
 electronic sounds but their most recent 'MACHINA/The Machines OF God'
 appears to have taken the band back to more familiar territory.

 Up there with the likes of @{"Motorhead" link "MOTORHEAD"} as one of the few groups to truly
 personify the rock 'n' roll ethic, Thin Lizzy wrote it like they lived
 it. Formed originally in Dublin by bassist/vocalist Phil Lynott and school
 friend drummer Brian Downey, they first started out with Alan Bell on
 guitar. For the first few years they suffered general public apathy and
 a number of guitarist line-up changes, but it was with 1976's classic
 'Jailbreak' that Lizzy came of age in style. The band had already earned
 a bad reputation as a hard-living outfit and their most enduring anthem
 to this life style 'The Boys Are Back In Town' was a major hit single.
 More line-up changes followed but a string of classic albums - 'Johnny
 The Fox', 'Bad Reputation', 'Live And Dangerous' and 'Black Rose (A Rock
 Legend)' ensured that the band's place in rock history was guaranteed.
 By now their bad habits were taking a serious toll on the band's stability,
 and particularly on Lynott's failing health. The early 80s records were
 solid enough but it was with the frankly superb 'Thunder And Lightning'
 that the band defied expectation by calling it a day. The split allowed
 Lynott to dry out and continue dabbling with his new solo effort called
 Grand Slam which, incredibly, failed to land a record deal. After a hit
 single collaboration in 1985 with ex-Lizzy guitarist @{"Gary Moore" link "GARY MOORE"} on 'Out

@node "TOOL"

 TOOL

 The word 'alternative' is probably the best way of describing this totally
 unique outfit from LA. They have deliberately gone out of their way to
 avoid the machinations of both the music industry and also the accepted
 ways of making music. Formed in 1991 by Tool mastermind Maynard James
 Keenan (vocals) and guitarist Adam Jones their sole aim was to create the
 heaviest, most abrasively experimental form of heavy metal they could,
 while at the same time defying everyone's expectations as to exactly where
 they would head to next. When their 1992 'Opiate' EP first emerged it was
 stunningly heavy sonic experience dubbed by some critics as 'hatecore'.
 As a result the band drew comparisons to just about every single-minded
 noise-making outfit from @{"Helmet" link "HELMET"} to the @{"Rollins" link "HENRY ROLLINS"} Band. If 'Opiate' was
 a taster for what Tool were capable of they delivered something even more
 intense with 1993's 'Undertow' album, and with the grungy atmoshere of the
 time there was a ready market for the band's disturbing musings.
 Henry Rollins himself actually made a spoken word appearance on 'Bottom'
 and tracks like 'Prison Sex' - their comment on child abuse - made for
 particularly bleak, but fascinating, listening. Already the bands
 experimental attitude had garnered huge amounts of both critical and fan
 praise, but it took three years to come up with 'Aenima' and when they
 did the band baffled everyone. Heavy on atmosphere, parts of 'Aenima'
 came dangerously close to prog rock in places - an extraordinary feat,
 considering the band were still bomb heavy too. This unwillingness to
 pander to people's expectations has led them to turn down lucrative
 support slots and TV appearances, to basically defy the rules by which
 bands progress through the music industry. Maynard James Keenan's latest
 twisted career move has been to create another band A Perfect Circle,
 leaving fans of Tools particularly dark brand of arty rock wondering just
 what will happen next.

 TYPE O NEGATIVE

 The doomy, gloomy Type O Negative might seem to be a million miles from
 the hardcore scene of the 80s and yet it was from the remnants of notorious
 New York band Carnivore that bassist/vocalist Pete Steele created this
 miserable outfit. Steele, however, would soon prove to be well beyond the
 two-dimensional thrashing of New York hardcore. He would also prove to be
 something of an enigma when it came to the lyrical subject matter of his
 new band. With 1991's 'Slow, Deep And Hard' debut, the music was slowed
 right down to a dirge-like quality made all the more grinding and powerful
 through some painfully distorted guitar noise. And then there were the
 actual songs which brought all kinds of accusations about misogyny and
 misanthropy. One thing was for sure, Steele's dry and dour sense of humour
 informed pretty much everything the band did. With 1993's 'Bloody Kisses'
 Steele introduced more Beatles-y style melodies to counterpoint his rich
 resonant vocals and depressing lyrics, although it was still hard to tell
 if throughout his tales of misery he wasn't really just playing a massive
 joke on everyone. In equal turns funny and downright serious, by now the
 band were making serious commercial headway and with 1996's gothic
 masterpiece 'October Rust' they began building upon their unlikely pop
 appeal. Steele even went so far as to pose nude in Playgirl magazine.
 1999's 'World Coming Down' merely enhanced the band's reputation as highly
 enjoyable world-class miserablists with a suspect sense of humour.

 UFO

 One of the finest hard rock bands Britain ever produced UFO have influenced
 countless newcomers with their tough and melodic brand of hard rock. Formed
 way back in 1969 the early incarnation of the band was nothing like the
 tight outfit that went on to greatness during the 70s. Their first three
 albums were highly dubious affairs very influenced by the droning
 psychedelia of space rock. It was when they were supported in Germany,
 in 1973, by the @{"Scorpions" link "SCORPIONS"} that UFO finally took off, so to speak. Their
 guitarist @{"Michael Schenker" link "MICHAEL SCHENKER"} helped them out when guitarist Bernie Marsden
 failed to show up for a gig and ended up joining the band.
 Employing Schenker was the smartest move the could have made because his
 firey, passionate style led to a brilliant clutch of albums. Records like
 'Force It', 'Lights Out', and 'Obsession' were packed with punchy, powerful
 rock songs and some superlative guitar work from Schenker. A fine example
 of the band's storming live performances can also be sampled on the
 double-live 'Strangers In The Night'. This period of major commercial
 success, naturally had it's downside - in this case, the band found it
 hard not to live the rock 'n' roll life style to the max. The result was
 an chemical and alcohol intake of stunning proportions and eventual
 implosion. Schenker left, and while the likes of 'No Place To Run',
 'The Wild The Willing And The Innocent', and 'Mechanix' saw the band into
 the early 80s they never achieved those halcyon heights ever again.
 Eventually things just fizzled out in 1983. There have been subsequent
 efforts over the intervening years, most notably by singer Phil Mogg,
 to get UFO flying again, and a new album featuring Schenker appears to
 be in the pipeline at present.

 When Uriah Heep formed in 1968 they had it all, the blues-heavy sound,
 the songs about sword and sorcery, the Roger Dean fantasy cover art.
 The embraced so many rock cliches it was frightening but at the same time,
 despite their lack of irony and genre excesses, the Heep did epitomise
 a certain style of rock, a style that still enjoys many adherents today.
 When they first started rehearsals in 1969, by sheer chance, they found
 themselves next door to @{"Deep Purple" link "DEEP PURPLE"} who were developing their own brand
 of bluesy hard rock. When Heep's debut 'Very 'Eavy, Very 'Umble' was
 released in 1970 some of the Purple influence seems to have rubbed off
 on them. And while Purple's Hammond-dominated sound was very much their
 own, so Heep's identity was unique enough to influence upcoming outfits
 such as Golden Earring and early @{"Scorpions" link "SCORPIONS"}. The band managed to make
 a name for themselves basically by having a couple of truly knock-out
 cuts each album and fans loved the likes of Gypsy (from their debut),
 'Bird Of Prey' (from 'Salisbury') and 'July Morning (from 'Look At
 Yourself'). The songs 'Easy Livin'' and 'Sweet Lorraine' made their two
 1972 albums 'Demons And Wizards' and 'The Magician's Birthday' even more
 successful. Sadly, with punk in the late 70s Heep, as with so many of
 their contemporaries, began to stagnate. That and the thrash movement
 would have killed any less determined outfit. Heep, however, obviously
 don't have the desire to die gracefully and have managed to soldier on
 well into the 90s. Their last album was 1998's 'Sonic Origami'.

 It's funny to think that this immensely successful hard rock band actually

 The suggestion to name themselves after guitarist Eddie Van Halen came
 from singer @{"David Lee Roth" link "DAVID LEE ROTH"} and the combination of their complementing
 talents would take the band to the very pinnacle of success. When the band
 formed back in 1975 they were originally a covers band but soon developed
 a reputation as stars in the making with some inspired performances around
 the California club scene. Given a chance to shine in the studio by
 legendary hard rock producer Ted Templeman and the results were magical.
 Their 1978 self-titled debut was the very essence of vaudeville pizzazz
 (thanks to 'Diamond' Dave) and guitar heaven (thanks to Eddie's
 finger-flinging antics). 'Van Halen II', 'Women And Children First' and
 'Fair Warning', and '1984' were platinum-selling classics one and all,
 displaying an intuitive grasp of both melody and showmanship. And yet
 a band like Van Halen seemingly couldn't be home to two such monumental

 Whether you regard the Geordie metallers as the very musical incarnation

 immense influence Cronos (bass/vocals), Mantas (guitar) and Abaddon exerted
 on the nascent black metal and thrash scenes. Formed in 1980 the band
 legendarily refused to support anyone and so their first gig was apparently
 a headlining slot at the Hammersmith Odeon back in June 1984! Whatever the
 facts are, however, it was with such intense live performances - huge
 quantities of pyrotechnics and a ridiculously loud sound system - that
 the band became immediately synonymous. Not only that, their records were
 equally brutal. 1981's 'Welcome To Hell' was an unsubtle blur of thrashing
 guitars, snarled vocals and tales of infernal damnation. Follow-up album,
 the appropriately titled 'Black Metal', however, is arguably the recording
 from which so many other bands would draw inspiration to explore the genre
 themselves. It was a diabolical masterpiece. 'At War With Satan' provided
 more of the same and then things started to go very wrong indeed with

 Formed back in 1982, Eric Forrest (bass/vocals), Dennis D'Amour (guitar)
 and Michel Langevin (drums), were very far from being progenitors of
 industrial metal despite their name and conceptual stance. In fact, they
 were more punk than anything else, a musical style which seemed at odds
 with their love of sci-fi. During the 80s this love of the fantastical had
 the band leaping off in pursuit of the bizarre and epic tale of Voivod in
 tandem with a dischordant musical style which drew them into the thrash
 scene on the backs of such wonderfully titled albums as 'War And Pain'
 and 'RRROOOAAARRR!'. Their output was self-consciously obnoxious when they
 first began - witness the latter album's unequivocally titled 'Fuck Off
 And Die' track - a style which gradually became less overtly offensive
 and became simply strange with such later albums as 'Nothingface' and
 'Angel Rat'. Most recently the band have been critically lauded for the
 experimentation of 1995's 'Negatron', and their latest album, 'Phobos',
 has them relaunching the Voivod sci-fi epic. Bizarrely it contains

 ex-New York Doll Blackie Lawless in 1982 WASP's raison d'etre was to shock,

 seemingly without trying. Their stage show involved 'torturing' a woman
 on a rack, chucking loads of raw meat and blood around, and, of course,
 there was Blackie's infamous flame-throwing cod piece. Already legends
 on the live circuit around Los Angeles, their tasteless rock circus wasn't
 confined simply to their cod theatrics. They famously signed to major label
 Capitol and then tried to get them to release the unassuming 'Animal
 (Fuck Like A Beast)' as a single! That song would make them, quite rightly,
 stars of the 80s metal scene. The cartoonish brand of schlock horror made
 them prime targets for parents groups like the PMRC and they rose to the
 challenge like true gladiators. 'WASP' was a magnificent debut, but
 subsequent albums 'Last Command' and 'Inside the Electric Circus' proved
 that at heart they were fine commercial songwriters with a keen ear for
 chart gold. The band's late 80s output was no less impressive, but a shift
 away from overt shock rock and a greater desire to explore their potential
 resulted in the more commercial 'The Headless Children'. Meanwhile 1992

 Of all the most successful British rock bands of recent Whitesnake must
 still rate as one of the most influential and thoroughly entertaining.
 They officially came into existence in 1978 with the four-track 'Snakebite'
 EP (actually under the name David Coverdale's Whitesnake), and basically
 provided a vehicle for former @{"Deep Purple" link "DEEP PURPLE"} vocalist David Coverdale to
 exercise his chest-beatingly macho style of bluesy hard rock. At this they
 were quite marvellous, featuring in their ranks such solid rock talent as
 guitarists Bernie Marsden and Micky Moody, bassist Neil Murray, drummer
 David Dowle and keyboardist Pete Solley. The latter was soon replaced by
 Purple's Jon Lord. The band went on to turn out some stunningly powerful
 albums of thrusting hard rock, in particular, 'Lovehunter' (and its
 absurdly sexist sleeve art) and the even less subtle 'Slide It In'.
 However, it was with a certain little album, unassumingly titled '1987',
 that Coverdale's fortunes would soar. The earlier classic blues sound
 had been polished to a commercial gleam and the overall feel was one of
 all-conquering majesty. The band had been re-invented as a major
 stadium-filler for the big-haired 80s. The hits flowed, not least the
 awesome 'Still Of The Night', and the band enjoyed sell out tours
 especially in the US. Unfortunately, a certain creative short-sightedness
 crept in thereafter and 1989's 'Slip Of The Tongue', devoid of the hoary
 old charm of previous outings was an impressive album for all the wrong
 reasons. The songs were solid enough but the technical prowess of guitarist

 Formed at the height of the thrash explosion in 1985, White Zombie were
 at first a fairly generic metal outfit combining battering rhythms with
 frenetic guitar work in a style that differed very little from their
 contemporaries. At the roots of the Zombie sound, however, was the
 demented genius of one Rob Zombie, for whom being yet another death-metal
 style band was simply not enough. Rob Zombie's love of trash culture and,
 in particular, EC horror comics and sub-standard b-grade shock flicks
 provided him with plenty of lyrical avenues to explore in the way of
 schlocky gore and tongue-in-cheek humour. Their first album, 1988's
 'Soul Crusher' featured such joyously titled tales of malevolence and
 perversity as 'Shack Of Hate' and 'Die Zombie Die'. Follow-up, 1989's
 'Make Them Die Slowly' was more of the same although their bass-heavy
 style of grinding metal was heading away from thrash and more towards
 a sort of bouncing groove. A move to Geffen in the early 90s, however,
 provided the funds and time to fully realise Rob Zombie's dastardly
 scheme for world domination. 'La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume I' was
 a rib-crunching beast of a record, all shock horror and sense-swamping
 noise - it was classic sci-fi and comics brought to life. As if to
 underline the fact that White Zombie existed to fulfill Rob Zombie's own

 Steeler. This partnership was shortlived but allowed Malmsteen to immerse
 himself in the LA music scene and so launch a solo career. His new band
 was called Rising Force and it was a blustering heavy metal outfit par
 excellence. No technical extremes were too tough to reach and their 1984
 debut was an unbeatable testament to a man at the peak of his powers.
 Sure, his and the band's style owed much to Ritchie Blackmore and @{"Rainbow" link "RAINBOW"}
 but it was outstandingly, endearingly over-the-top all the same and
 influenced thousands of equally passionate guitarists over the years.
 The remainder of the 80s brought a constantly fracturing line-up and
 several lacklustre albums but the 90s brought various dabblings with
 classical and orchestral styles, plus the added bonus of a burgeoning
 career in Japan.

 ZZ TOP

 Starting out with the unlikely name of the Moving Sidewalks these
 notoriously hairy Sons Of The South - Houston, Texas, to be precise - were
 a phenomenon in their home state long before they shot to international
 acclaim in the 80s. With their dirty, grinding blues sound guitarist
 Billy Gibbons, bassist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank Beard were filling
 stadiums way back in the 70s with such classic albums as 'Tres Hombres',
 'Fandango', 'Tejas' and 'Deguello', every one of them an authentic and
 potent brew of southern boogie and knowing tongue-in-cheek humour.
 It wasn't until the advent of MTV, however, that they found a truly
 international audience as the tried-and-tested girls 'n' cars formula
 catapulted the synth-laden boogie of 'Eliminator' to the top of the charts
 with MTV hits like 'Legs', 'TV Dinners' and 'Sharp Dressed Man'. Things
 continued to go stratospheric with 1985's 'Afterburner' but have appeared
 to dip more recently as the band have tamed their original gritty sound
 increasingly for radio and MTV consumption. Nevertheless, when it comes
 to the perfect accompaniment to an ice cold brew on a steamy summer night
 then these good ol' boys are damn hard to beat.
