Japan goes digital
Japan's first digital TV package started on JCSAT 3 (128°E) today,
initially offering a bundle of 60 TV and radio channels. Future plans
call for an increase to 170 channels.
More than 35,000 decoders for the service called PerfecTV have already
been sold,. Perfect TV Corporation said it expects 300,000 subscribers
by the end of the year and over a million within the next three years.
The price for the reception equipment (decoder and satellite dish)
reportedly is about 50,000 (US$450.)
The company recently doubled its capital to ¥50 billion (US$455 million)
by issuing new shares to a total of 28 companies, 23 of them new
investors such as Toyota Motor, Sony and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp.
The next digital venture is already close at hand. Rupert Murdoch will
launch his JSkyB service next June, co-operating with the domestic
software wholesaler Softbank Corp. while at the same time buying 21.4
percent of the Japanese Asahi TV network. Other companies have announced
digital satellite TV services as well.

premiere breaks even
Germany's one and only analogue pay-TV channel premiere has announced it
will break even this year following a 30 percent surge in revenues. Next
year, profits are expected to surpass the DM10-million mark even though
further investments of some DM100 million are planned.
Recently, premiere recorded more than 100,000 new subscribers within a
period of six weeks. It is of course by no means unusual that such services
attract many subscribers during the Christmas season. And even though
premiere's subscriber base now is at an all-time high of 1.4 million, it
still is just a negligible percentage of Germany's 32.7 million TV
households.

@node "spy"

Openness -- without telling secrets
For the first time, the USA today officially announced the launch of a spy
satellite. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO,) which is in charge of
spy satellite operations, has acknowledged that a Titan IV booster rocket
will lift off from Vandenberg Air Force Base with a reconnaissance
spacecraft on board next Friday. The launch window will be open between
11:30 A.M. EST (1630 UTC) and 1:00 P.M. EST (1800 UTC).
And that was all the Office, which by the way was top secret itself until
1992, was prepared to say. Except that those satellite launches weren't
really secret, of course, because the blast-off of any rocket was unlikely
to go unnoticed. Usually, the U.S. Air Force wouldn't comment on those
unannounced launches "on the grounds of national security," so that
everybody could be sure it was indeed a spy satellite that went up.
So, nothing new really, expect for the fact that those interested in
satellite launches will now know one day earlier that they will be told
nothing.

British government considers sex harmful
Once again, the British government has effectively banned a hard-core
satellite TV channel. French Rendez-Vous Télévision, broadcasting on
EUTELSAT II-F3 (16°E) at 10.987 GHz h, may no longer sell viewing cards in
Britain.
Speaking at the Tory Party conference in Bournemouth, National Heritage
Secretary Virginia Bottomley today declared she would "not tolerate
gratuitous violence and filth on television." Rendez-Vous is the third
porn-channel banned in the UK, following similar measures against Red Hot
TV in 1993 and TV Erotica in 1995.
The opposition Labour Party obviously does not object to the government's
move. Their shadow national heritage secretary Dr Jack Cunningham pledged a
Labour government would tackle pornography on TV. "A Labour government will
definitely act to prevent it."
Rendez-Vous' Roger Kingsbourg accused the government of treating TV viewers
like children, poiting out that "We do not show unnatural situations and we
have a strict policy of only showing adult sex. And we are not in the
business of broadcasting programmes to minors."
British viewers will be able to use their current smart cards until they
expire. After that, there will certainly be other ways of getting hold of
one - it will probably just cost a bit more. In addition to that, Britain
has no legal means to ban unscrambled trailers broadcast by Rendez-Vous and
other porn channels. Usually, these 15-minute trailers are shown before the
scrambled programmes start.

Search warrant against Med-TV
One again, Kurdish Med TV disappeared yesterday -- this time from its
new transponder on INTELSAT 705 (18°W.) The last time the channel
vanished it did so because of uplink problems. This time, the nature of
the interruption seems to be of a more severe nature.
As MSAT satellit's Dr. Dish reported today, police and tax office
agencies searched the station's headquarters in Denderleeuw/Belgium on
Wednesday.
MED-TV is accused of maintaining connections with the Kurdish PKK and of
acting as a money-laundry to clean up drug-traffickers money. 
During a similar raid last year, BFr350 million (US$10 million) were
found. The station, which utilises a British satellite TV license to
reach its audience, is said to be financed mainly by Kurdish businessmen
living in Belgium. Nothing is known about the future of MED-TV at this
time.

EKSPRESS 6 at 80°E
Thanks to Hornedo Rodriguez Gonzalez, Marketing Manager of Intersputnik,
here are some details on the latest EKSPRESS satellite launched on
September 26.
"Intersputnik, the Moscow based International Organisation of Space
Communications, has been authorised by Russian Space Organisations to
operate the main capacity of EKSPRESS 6. 
"EKSPRESS is a new generation of satellites designed to replace the
GORIZONT satellites. The payload consists of twelve active transponders:
One C-band (6/4 GHz) transponder of 40 MHz, nine C-band (6/4 GHz)
transponders of  36 MHz and two Ku-band (14/11GHz) transponders of 36 MHz.
The maximum EIRP of C-band transponders will be in the range of     
38.0-48.0 dBW and for Ku-band 42.0 dBW. 
"EKSPRESS 6 will be deployed at 80°E to replace GORIZONT 24. It will ensure
coverage of the Eastern European continent, Northern Africa, Middle East,
Eurasia, the Indian subcontinent and South Eastern Asia. As soon as
in-orbit tests are over and the satellite becomes operational later this
year, Intersputnik will start reconnecting its existing and new clients to
EKSPRESS 6 according to received booking requests."
Interestingly, NASA has recently given the name of the satellite as
"EKPRESS 12," so don't get confused. Anyway, EKSPRESS 6 (NORAD number:
24435) is already geostationary at 80°E, according to NORAD data from
October 8.

Good bye, digital TV
Digital television in Germany is over before it had really begun. Today,
two of the major players announced independently to abandon their
current plans for digital TV packages.
Media company Bertelsmann said it has put its digital TV project Club
RTL on halt while at the same time considering to leave the Multimedia
Betriebsgesellschaft (MMBG.) This alliance of telecommunications
companies and broadcasters already suffered a heavy blow last Monday
when Deutsche Telekom declared it would leave the consortium and offer
its own conditional access system instead (Sat-ND, 16.9.96.)
Bertelsmann board member Thomas Middelhoff called the prospects of
digital TV "hopelessly overestimated," adding that his company won't
spent billions of Marks that can't be earned back before ten year's
time. Club RTL may still be launched, but not as planned before at end
of the year. According to Middelhoff, Bertelsmann will wait until the
market is ready for another digital package to compete with Leo Kirch's
DF1.
Other companies seem to have come to the conclusion that the German
market with its dozens of free channels will never be ready for pay-TV
on a broad basis. Pro Sieben, ranging number three of the most popular
(free) channels, has entirely sacked its seven-channel package which was
due to be launched on November, 16. "After thoroughly examining the
market, we came to the conclusion that there's no business for us here,"
admitted Georg Kofler, director of the board. He said the company would
still continue its plans to offer digital transmissions for business and
corporate TV.
Ironically, Pro Sieben is not a member of the ill-fated MMBG but instead
of the Kirch family's media empire. As such, it had planned to use
Kirch's d-box for its package. Insiders already claim Kirch is thankful
for every decoder he does _not_ sell in Germany as the boxes are heavily
subsidised.

Digital problems in USA
Even in the USA, where digital TV seems to develop more successful,
first doubts have surfaced. Continental Cablevision Inc. may sell its
stake in Primestar Partners, a cable operator-backed direct broadcast
satellite venture. 
Continental president/CEO William Schleyer isn't at all sure that Direct
Satellite Broadcasting "is a great business going forward." Referring to
the latest reductions in set-top box prices and special offers, he added
"These guys are killing each other with price. So, what kind of business
is it going forward?"

@node "Ariane-1"


SKYNET stays with Arianespace
Arianespace will launch the military SKYNET 4F for the British Ministry of
Defence. A contract signed today by Arianespace and the satellite's
constructor, Matra Marconi Space, calls for a lift in the second half of
1999. 
Skynet 4F is the last in a series of six British military communications
satellites. Built by Matra Marconi Space in the United Kingdom, it will
weigh approximately 1,500 kg (3,300 lb.) at launch and will offer 1.5 kW of
power. Design life is seven years. SKYNET 4F will provide government
communications links for various land, sea and airborne terminals.
Following the launch of SKYNET 4B (53°E) in December 1988 and SKYNET 4C
(1°W) in August 1990, Arianespace plans to launch Skynet 4E and 4F in 1998
and 1999, respectively.
It is the third launch booked by Matra Marconi this year following similar
turnkey contracts with Singapore Telecom/Chunghwa Telecom (Taiwan) and the
Egyptian Radio and Television (ERTU.)
With this launch contract, the 17th of the Year, Arianespace now has 42
satellites on order to be launched.
Arianespace is the world leader in the provision of commercial space
transportation services. Matra Marconi Space is a joint venture between
Lagardere Groupe SA of France and General Electric PLC of the UK.

Ariane sets up satellite bank (well, kind of)
In case you have a satellite but no money go get it up where you want it,
you might as well go ask Arianespace for a credit. It doesn't quite work
out that way, but a newly created Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Arianespace
Finance, will provide up to US$400 million in loans to Arianespace
customers, allowing simultaneous financing for eight to ten customers.
Financing will be provided for three to ten years after the satellite
launch.
Arianespace today said in a press release that "the loans are principally
for customers who do not yet have access to bank financing because their
projects are new and because they wish to finance their projects based on
revenues generated by the satellite.
"These loans will be refinanced by a group of banks led by Credit Lyonnais
(France), The Chase Manhattan Bank (USA), Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau
(Germany) and ING Lease and Structured Finance (The Netherlands). These
banks will also assume a portion of the risk after launch." [What risk? --

@node "Inmarsat-1"



Another INMARSAT launched
An Atlas IIA rocket this morning successfully launched the third of the
new-generation Inmarsat mobile communications satellites into
geosynchronous transfer orbit from Cape Canaveral Air Station. Inmarsat-3
F3 follows the successful launches of F1 and F2 aboard an Atlas from Cape
Canaveral in April and the Russian Proton from Baikonur in September. It
was the 27th consecutive successful Atlas launch from CCAS and the seventh
and final Atlas launch of 1996.
Inmarsat-3 F3 was built by Lockheed Martin, which is responsible for
overall spacecraft design, manufacturing, assembly and testing. Matra
Marconi Space provided the communications payload onboard the satellite.
Once in final orbit, Inmarsat-3 F3 will provide global mobile
communications services on land, at sea and in the air. It will extend the
availability of the Inmarsat-phone service to almost all of the world's
land areas.  
The Atlas IIA is one of four variants in the Atlas family presently
launching satellites for domestic and international customers. The Atlas II
series, consisting of the II, IIA and IIAS, has compiled a perfect record
with 100 percent mission success of each configuration starting with the
Atlas II introduction in 1991, the Atlas IIA in 1992 and the Atlas IIAS in
1993. The Atlas family is capable of launching satellites weighing from
2,268 to 3,696 kg (5,000 to 8,150 lbs). The new Atlas IIAR, which will
begin launching in 1998, expands that performance capability to 4,037 kg
(8,900 lbs).

this is one of the digital services that has started for our german
friends.

Canal + (france) has also started it's digital service. The british satellite
magazine " had a review of the D-BOX they will use and as the bris said - "
when digital televison crashes it does that in a BIG way"

No i will leavy you for now, but will be back with a new guide in feb/mar 97.

This is how those clewer chaps at SES want to build the 19.2° position.

But you don't understand much of this. ?
Let me help you out a bit.

ASTRA 1A will use 11.20-11.45 ghz and backup for 1a is on 1B 11.45 - 11.70

Half-Transponder Note:  Vertically polarized transponders are 
theoretically the only transponders that can be made into half 
transponders.  The downlink frequencies above are center frequencies for 
a full transponder.  To get the approximate lower half transponder 
downlink frequency, subtract 13.5 MHz from the center full transponder 
frequency.  To get the approximate upper half transponder downlink 
frequency, add 13.5 MHz to the center full transponder frequency. 
 
Cross-strapping: C-band transponders 18 and 24 can cross-strap to 
Ku-band transponders 17 and 23.

Half-Transponder Note:  The downlink frequencies above are already half 
transponder frequencies. 
 
Note:  This is an incomplete list of services on Anik E1 Ku-band based 
on contributions.  My location is too far south to receive the 
majority of the channels on this satellite, so contributions are 
always welcome. 
 
Note: Transponders 1-8 are National Beams.  9-16 are Western Beams. 
17-20 are National Beams. 21-32 are Eastern Beams.
