 With Kryten still classed as a woman, he tells the other inmates that he's
 upset because he has to shower with naked, wet and foamy women. Later on,
 Kryten is attacked and reprogrammed so the male prisoners can view this event
 on the pay-per-view prison television channel. Lister and Rimmer have to stop
 him before the appeal against their sentence is revoked.

 After creating a Dinosaur out of the Birdman's pet sparrow, Rimmer, Lister,
 Cat, Kryten and Kochanski have to find it and use the Time Wand to return it
 to its previous state before it completely destroys the ship. Unfortunately,
 the Dinosaur has swallowed the Time Wand, so Lister creates a very hot cow
 vindaloo to help it pass through its digestive system.
