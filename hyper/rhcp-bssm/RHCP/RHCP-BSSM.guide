@node ABOUT "About This Guide & Contacting Me..."
I thought these guides would be a nice to do, giving the Amiga comunity out
there the chance to read the lyrics of their favourite computer (Amiga of
course!). Plus it saves you having to continually take the insert out of
its case, getting it ripped, etc.

Enjoy!

If I've made a mistake anywhere in the guide, please contact me at:-

tarquel@ddyfi.ruralwales.org

or visit my NEW website:-

http://website.lineone.net/~tarquel/

If you are interested in developing Amiga games or have some skills in
programming, graphics, etc., please take a look at the following link:-

The site should explain itself :)...
...Unless I've messed up somewhere (I run the site you see!)

Although there really isn't a need for a history section...who cares, I'm
putting it in anyway!

V1.0 (25-6-99)      I wrote out the words ages ago so I can't remember if
                    they are an exact match or not. When I have I shall

1.  Breaking the Girl

I am a man
Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go
She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged
Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

 Chorus
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you know harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no-one else


Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way
She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home
I don't know what, when or why
The twilight of love had arrived

 (Repeat Chorus)

2.  My Lovely Man

I used to shout across the room to you
And you'd come dancing like a fool
Shuffle step you funky mother
Come to me all warm as covers

Rest with me my lovely brother
For you see there is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon save me a seat

 Chorus
Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no-one can
Ever fill the,
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can


In my room I'm all alone
Waiting for you to get home
Listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back

 (Repeat Half Chorus)

Just in case you never knew
I missed you slim I love you too
See my heart it's black and blue
When I die I will find you

 (Repeat Chorus)

3.  I Could Have Lied

There must be something
In the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me
I don't care-
You see so what if I bleed

 Chorus
I could never change
Just what I feel
My face will never show
What is not real


A mountian never seems to have
The need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling
I got from you
The things I said to you were true

 (Repeat Chorus)

I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never-never-never
Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm mucked up now


But now she's gone, yes she's gone away
A soulful song
That would not stay
You see she hides 'cause she is scared
But I don't care
I won't be spared

 (Repeat Verse 3+4)

4.  Suck My Kiss

Should have been, could have been
Would have been dead
If I didn't get the message
Goin' to my head
I am what am
Most normal people
Dont give a damn
Aw baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man

Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo Peep
Coming from my stun gun
Beware take care
Most normal people
Have a cold hard stare
Aw baby please be there
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

 Chorus
Hit me, you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me
Stick with this
Is she talking dirty
Give it to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss


Look at me can't you see
All I really want to be
Is free from a world
That hurts me
I need relief
Do you want me girl
To be your thief
Aw baby just for you
I'd steal enything you want me to

K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Chicka chicka dee
Do me like a banshee
Low brow is how
Swiming in the sound
Of bow-wow-wow
Aw baby do me now
Do my here I do allow

 (Repeat Chorus)

5.  The Righteous & The Wicked

I can't rest in war
Will you be my friend
Dark ages never change
I can't comprehend

Kiss me we self destruct
Can you hear me lord
Yes I think we're stuck
But I can't rest in war

 Chorus
The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist
Of the human beast
P.o.p.
Prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
I am playing for a better day


Holy mother earth
Crying into space
Tears on her pretty face
For she has escaped

Killing your future blood
Fill her with disease
Global distortion please
That is what she needs

 (Repeat Chorus)

Are we fire flies
Flashing in the night
Big thunder rumble fish
Did you get it right

Headstrong battle song
Exploding souls be gone
Marvin gave my love
Where did we go wrong

 (Repeat Chorus)

6.  Under The Bridge

Sometime I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lovely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on the streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie

 Chorus
I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way


It's hard to belive
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to belive
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

 (Repeat Chorus)

Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away

7.  The Greeting Song

Drivin' around-
I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down-
In the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

Makin' my way-
I brake another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My chevrolet-
Rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love

 Chorus Part1
Who you
You talkin' to
Talk to me you
Sound of music

 (Repeat Part1)

 Chorus Part2
I love you
Swim through me
Good feelings
Come to me


Sought and I-
Found a life of makin' my blood sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound-
The face of God is in sensoround
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

 (Repeat Chorus Part1 [X2] & Part2)

8.  If You Have To Ask

A wanna be gangster
Thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank
He's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head-
Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him in the eye
He's not my kinda guy
Never be
Confusion proof
Pudding's sweet
But too aloof
Orange eye girl
With a backside dew said
Yo home
Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddy wagon
Muckin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
Add a little lust
To the funky ass Flea Bass
Most in the race
Just lose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space
Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some

 Chorus
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky little brothers
Will not be told to go


Dont ask me why
I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets Superfly
In my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand My hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on Vaudeville
I feel so good
Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood

 (Repeat Chorus)

9.  Mellowship Slinky in B Major

I've got a mellowship
I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop 'yo swan' hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No I can not keep my mouth shut
Rockin to the beat of the fabulousforum
My lakers I adore them
Blush my lady when I tell her
That I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink unbrella
Do the dog with Isabella

I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination he's the smartest
Robert Williams stroke and splatter
I attest to your grey matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favourite things

 Chorus
Good god - Where's my sleigh now
Good god - Playing for days now
Good god - Any day now
Good god - Take me away now
Good god - Purple haze
Good god - The baddest of brains
Good god - Any day now
Good god - Ridin' my sleigh now


Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about-
What true men don't do
Killing another creature-
That's kind of blue
Writing about the world-
Of the wild coyote
Good man Truman Capote
Talking about my thoughts
'Cause they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on my porch
'Cause I lost my house key
Pick up my book and read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo

 (Repeat 1st Half of Chorus)
Good god - Deniros insane now
Good god - Rackin' my brain now
Good god - Any day now
Good god - Take me away now  take me away


Me my friends and sex machine
Do unto others like my brother Bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favourite things
