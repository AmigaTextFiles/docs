MathX is an edited version of topaz.  It retains all the common used characters, and replaces the obscure ones with maths characters:

MathX characters: alt-d - ð - Square Root
            shift-alt-d - Ð - pi
                  alt-p - ¶ - enter
            shift-alt-z - ¬ - exponential x

@node P1Polynomials "P1: Algebraic Processing Skills - Polynomials"
@{u}Polynomials@{uu}

A polynomial is an algebraic expression that is a sum of a number of terms.
    eg. 2x³ + 5x² + 6x + 1

The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x (example above is degree 3)

The most number of terms in an equation is [degree+1]
@endnode

@node P1PolynomialsAdd "P1: Algebraic Processing Skills - Adding & Subtracting Polynomials"
@{u}Adding and Subtracting Polynomials@{uu}

When adding or subtracting polynomials, only like terms can be combined.

eg. (3x²+2x+5)+(6x³+x+7) = 6x³+3x²+3x+12
@endnode

@node P1PolynomialsMulti "P1: Algebraic Processing Skills - Multiplying Polynomials"
@{u}Multiplying Polynomials@{uu}

When multiplying polynomials, add the indices

eg. (6x²+2x-3)(2x-4)
  = 12x³-24x²+4x²-8x-6x+12
  = 12x³-20x²-14x+12
@endnode

@node P1PolynomialsFactor "P1: Algebraic Processing Skills - Factorising Polynomials"
@{u}Factorising Polynomials@{uu}

When two expressions are equal for all values of x, the symbol '@{u}=@{uu}' (three parallel lines) should be used.  It is an @{"identity" link P2AlgebraIdentities}.

Commonly occuring identities:

(x+y)²     = x²+2xy+y²
(x-y)²     = x²-2xy+y²
(x-y)(x+y) = x²-y²
(x+y)³     = x³+3x²y+3xy²+y³
(x-y)³     = x³-3x²y+3xy²-y³

To factorise, take out a common factor:

eg. 3x+6 = 3(x+2)

When working with trinomials, you must factorise into 2 brackets:

eg. x²-8x+16 = (x-4)(x-4)

or the longer way:

for an equation ax²+bx+c=0, find two factors of ac which add up to give b.  The bx part of the equation can then be rewritten:

2x²+4x-6=0

Two factors of 2 and -6: -2 and 6

2x²-2x+6x-6=0

Factorise in pairs:

2x(x-1)+6(x-1)=0   »»» THE BRACKETS MUST BE THE SAME «««

Take everything outside into one bracket, and inside into another:

(2x+6)(x-1)=0
@endnode

@node P1Surds "P1: Algebraic Processing Skills - Surds"
@{u}Surds@{uu}

Surds are numbers which cannot be worked out exactly.

A rational number is a number which can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers.  eg. 5, 0.3, 1(1/5), -1.79(-179/100), ð9

Irrational numbers are decimals which repeat (not a fixed length).  eg. ð11, ð2, Ð, e, surds.

@node P1EquationLinear "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Linear Equations"
@{u}Solving linear equations@{uu}

To solve you just re-arrange it collecting x terms on one side and numbers on the other:

eg. 2x+3 = 5
      2x = 5-3
       x = 2÷2
       x = 1
@endnode

@node P1EquationSim "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Solving Simultaneous Equations"
@{u}Solving Simultaneous Equations@{uu}

To solve simultaneous equations, you can use three different methods:

@{"Draw a graph" link P1EquationSimGraph}
@{"Elimination " link P1EquationSimElim}
@{"Substitution" link P1EquationSimSub}
@endnode

@node P1EquationSimGraph "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Simultaneous Equations"
@{u}Solving Simultaneous Equations Graphically@{uu}

Draw graphs accurately, writing down where they cross.
@endnode

@node P1EquationSimElim "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Simultaneous Equations"
@{u}Solving Simultaneous Equations By Elimination@{uu}

Cancel out one of the unknowns by subtracting one equation from the other.

eg. 2x+3y=9   [Eq1]
    4x+9y=12  [Eq2]

Eq1 × 2: 4x+6y=18  [Eq3]

Eq2-Eq3: 3y=-6
          y=-2

Then @{"substitute" link P1EquationSimSub y into the other equation.
@endnode

@node P1EquationSimSub "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Simultaneous Equations"
@{u}Solving Simultaneous Equations By Substitution@{uu}

Rearrange one equation, then substitute it into the other one:

eg. 7x-9y=4 [Eq1]
      x+y=1 [Eq2]

Rearrange Eq2:     x=1-y

Substitute in Eq1: 7(1-y)-9y=4
                     7-7y-9y=4
                       7-16y=4
                           7=4+16y
                           3=16y
@{i}                           y=3/16@{ui}

Substitute y in one of the above equations:

                           x=1-(3/16)
                           x=@{u}13@{uu}

@endnode

@node P1EquationQuad "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Quadratic Equations"
@{u}Solving Quadratic Equations@{uu}

First make sure that the equation is in the form:

    ax²+bx+c=0

You can then use one of the following methods:

@{"Factorisation        " link P1EquationQuadFactor}
@{"Equation             " link P1EquationQuadEquation}
@{"Completing the Square" link P1EquationQuadSquare}
@endnode

@node P1EquationQuadFactor "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Quadratic Equations"
@{u}Solving Quadratic Equations by Factorisation@{uu}

First @{"factorise" link P1PolynomialsFactor} the equation, then make the first and second brackets equal to 0:

eg. (x-7)(x+2)=0

    x=7 or x=-2

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FACTORISE ALL QUADRATICS
@endnode

@node P1EquationQuadEquation "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Quadratic Equations"
@{u}Solving Quadratic Equations using the quadratic formulae@{uu}

Where ax²+bx+c=0, you can use the equation:

@{fg shine}x = @{u}-b ± ð(b²-4ac)@{uu}
            2a@{fg text}

b²-4ac is called the discriminant.

If b²-4ac=0, there is only one solution.
If b²-4ac>0, two solutions
If b²-4ac<0, no (real) solutions
If b²-4ac is a perfect square, the equation will factorise
@endnode

@node P1EquationQuadSquare "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Quadratic Equations"
@{u}Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square@{uu}

x²+6x-12=0

take the "+c" part of the equation over to the other side:

x²+6x=+12

Simplify the equation so the first term is just x² (if needed)

Write the first side as a square.  The second number in the bracket is ½ of the "bx" term:

(x+3)²=12

This is not true.  To make the equation correct you must add the square of the number in the bracket to the second side:

(x+3)²=12+9

(x+3)²=21
   x+3=±ð(21)-3

x=-ð(21)-3 or x=ð(21)-3

@{"Graph" link P1InEqualGraph}
@{"Table" link P1InEqualTable}
@endnode

@node P1InEqualGraph "P1: Equations and Inequalities - Quadratic Inequalities"
@{u}Solving Quadratic Inequalities Graphically@{uu}

Find the critical values by making ax²+bx+c=0.  This can be done by @{"solving" link P1EquationQuad} the equation.  The critical values show where the line crosses the x-axis.

The line crosses the y-axis at the "+c" value of the equation.

You can now @{"sketch" link P1FunctionsSketch} the curve and check to see which values of x satisfy the equation. (cr1<x<cr2 or x<cr1, x>cr2).

Alternatively, substitute numbers between and outside the critical values of x to check whether they satisfy the equation.
@endnode

@node P1InEqualTable "P1: Equations and Ineqaulities - Quadratic Inequalities"
@{u}Solving Quadratic Inequalities using a table@{uu}

Find the critical values by making the equation equal to 0, then @{"solving" link P1EquationQuad}.

You must @{"factorise" link P1PolynomialsFactor} the equation.

Complete the table below, where C1 is critical value 1 and C2 is critical value 2 for the equation (B1)(B2)=0.  Check values of x and write whether they are positive or negative underneath.  In the last column multiply the first two columns together.

@{u}        |  <C1  |C1<x<C2|  >C2  |

  (B2)  |   ±   |   ±   |   ±   |
(B1)(B2)|   ±   |   ±   |   ±   |@{uu}

The last column shows which range of values satisfy the equation (x<C1 or x>C2, C1<x<C2).
@endnode

@node P1Functions "P1: Functions"
@{u}Functions@{uu}

A function is a mapping between two variables, usually:

x: the independent variable
y: the dependent variable

The range of values taken by x is called the domain, and the range of values for y is called the range.

Functions are written:

f: x -> y     or     y = f(x)

y=f(x) is often called the cartesian equation of the function.

All symbols below should be double-lined:

Z: The set of integers

@node P1FunctionsInverse "P1: Functions - Inverse Functions"
@{u}Inverse Functions@{uu}

f:   x -> x+2
f-¹: x -> x-2

For a one-one function f, the inverse function f-¹ exists and ff-¹(x) = f-¹f(x) = x.

The inverse of a function f is the function that undoes f.

The graph of a function and its inverse are reflected in the line y=x.

If a function and its inverse are the same, the function is self-inverse (-x and /x functions are self inverse):

f(x)   = 4/x        f(x)   = 3-x
f-¹(x) = 4/x        f-¹(x) = 3-x

Moment of a force = magnitude of the force × perpendicular distance between
                                             the forces

The turning effect can be clockwise or anti-clockwise this is called the sense of the moment.

If a body is in @{b}@{"equilibrium" link M1Equil}@{ub}, the sum of the clockwise moments equals the sum of the anti-clockwise moments.

A @{i}sample@{ui} is a small group taken from a larger one.  If the large group involves all the people/items that have to be considered in a survey, then the large group is called the @{i}population@{ui}.
You can have a @{i}finite@{ui} population eg. pupils in a school, or you can have an @{i}infinite population@{ui} (unknown number).

A @{i}sampling unit@{ui} is an individual member chosen from the sampling frame.

@{u}Bias in Samples@{uu}

In many populations, there will be natural variations.  It is important when choosing a sampling frame to bear in mind any natural variation that is relevant to a particular survey and to ensure that the sampling frame covers all aspects of this natural variation.  If not, the sample could be biased.

Other ways in which the sample could be biased are:

1. Imposing a subjective opinion when setting up a survey
2. If a postal questionnaire was sent out, there will be a group of people who do not respond.  You need to consider the reasons for this non-response to check if it brings bias into the results.
3. It is important to put impartial questions in questionnaires to avoid bias.

For grouped data: The median should be at the (n+1)÷2 th item.  But, because with grouped data, n is large and we have already introduced inaccuracies by grouping the data, we take the approximation (n+1)÷2 = n÷2.

The median can also be calculated using the formula:

MEDIAN = b+[(½n-f)÷fc]×c

where, b = lower class boundary

We can see that they both have the same mean of 5, but pupil A is more consistent.  To measure this consistency, we have to look at a measure of dispersion or spread, such as the range.  For A, range = 0.  For B, range = 10.  The greater the measure of spread, the less consistent or reliable the results are.

Variance and standard deviation are measures of dispersion about the mean.  x - µ is the deviation of an individual score from the mean.  This is squared to overcome the problem of minus signs.  We then take the mean of these squared deviations to get the variance, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

For individual items of data:

(Z is supposed to be a summation sign)

variance = @{u}Z(x-µ)²@{uu}
              n

standard deviation = ð[@{u}Z(x-µ)²@{uu}]
                          n

For grouped data:

variance = @{u}Zf(x-µ)²@{uu}
              Zf

standard deviation = ð[@{u}Zf(x-µ)²@{uu}]
                          Zf


Alternative formulae:

Variance = @{u}Zx²@{uu} - µ²                     Variance = @{u}Zfx²@{uu} - µ²
            n                                       Zf

Standard deviation = ðvariance

Mean: The @{"sample mean" link T1Mean} is a good estimate of the population mean.

@{"Variance/standard deviation" link T1SD}: A better estimate for population mean is found by dividing by n-1 instead of n.
