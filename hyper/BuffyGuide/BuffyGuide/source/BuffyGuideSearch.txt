Inroduction
-----------
This program was created to be used in conjunction with Chris Sheffields
Buffy.guide, a truly outstanding collection of buffy info. Anyway various
diffrent methords were used to try and get a decent search engine into
the guide, using LASAGS and Chris's own custom ARexx code, however none
of these really worked well, so i wrote a better version.


Usage
-----
This search engine is basicly a cut down version of my regular expression
engine, but the useage is much simpler. The best way to do it, is just to
click on the search button in the guide. However it can be used seperatly
like this..

cd BuffyGuide/
BuffyGuideSearch Buffy.guide -s

where -s should be used if you want case sensitive search, or
-h for help, or -v for verbose (lots of) output, or -d for the internal
debug mode, which is probably best left alone, UNLESS you find a problem.


Requrements
-----------
An Amiga, with a 020+ CPU and OS 3.x at least 20k of ram (yes 20k).
You will of course need Chris Sheffields Buffy.guide, which can be found
on aminet.


Compilation
-----------
This code compiles for amiga gcc and dice, and borland c for windows, it
should work with others, but i cant test it. If you want to look at the
code please feel free, if you want to compile it try...

Then type,...

make -f makefile.amiga.gcc
or
dmake -f makefile.amiga.dice

and your program will appear in a few seconds.


Extras
------
There is a port of the AmigaGuide system to windows (on aminet), so you can
re-compile this code to be used with Chris's guide on windows systems if
you really want to, you will have to make a project file yourself, but the
sources have been coded so that support for BorlandC is in there.


Bugs
----
My code does not have bugs,.. no honist it dont,.. but the exe was compiled
for 68020+ systems an so wont work on A500s.

If you find anything going werid, dont spam Chris cos its not his error,
mail me at the above address and i will see about it.

But please, please give me lots of info, search string, your system (ram,
processor, software versions, patches, background hacks etc). BUT most
importantly a good description of the problem,.. if i cant reproduce it
then i can fix it.


Thanks
------
Chris Sheffield, for creating the wonderfull buffy guide..
Adam Dyer, for helping with a very annoying bug in the code..
Amiga Corp, for letting me have one of the developer boxes..
Buffy, for just being buffy...
