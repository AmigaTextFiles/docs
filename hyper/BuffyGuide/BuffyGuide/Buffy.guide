@{b}Season One Episodes@{ub}

This, along with the second season, is the golden age of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The season was roughly half as long as the following seasons, which added to the pace. Far be it from me to suggest that this season was entirely perfect, but there's something about it that seems really fresh and youthful. It could be the lower budget, the influence of different writers, or just how young the actors look - it was 6 years ago, after all. Saving the world is pretty every-day stuff in Buffy these days but at the end of season one, seeing it for the first time, it was a big deal.

@{b}Season Two Episodes@{ub}

I think everyone who has ever seen a television set has probably seen an episode from this season. Think season two, think Buffy and Angel. Their love story is the backbone of this season, and the influence of it seeps into almost every new Buffy episode - not to mention the Angel series. This really is @{i}the @{ui} classic season and finishes in total cliff-hanger mode: something none of the other seasons really do.

@{b}Season Three Episodes@{ub}

The first season to show signs of the psychological darkness and maturity of seasons 5 and 6, season three is also notable because it marks the Scooby Gang's last year in high school. Faith appears and rapidly develops into a fascinating and dangerous character. The whole show takes on another dimension, 'The Wish' being most indicative of the studio's newfound willingness to experiment with the Buffy formula.

@{b}Season Four Episodes@{ub}

Buffy-mania began to show signs of dropping off around the time of the US airing of season 4, the hubbub slowed down and people viewed the show as a Serious Thing, not just a Next Big Thing. Whether or not the quality of this season had anything to do with that is debatable, but the fact remains this season was very awkward, especially for long-time fans. Buffy goes to college (neat Descendents reference there), Angel's gone, everythings all over the place! The Initiative proves interesting to those of us who thought "but hang on, if Giles can fight a vampire, surely the army could tackle them?"

@{b}Season Five Episodes@{ub}

Buffy's fifth season is easily its darkest yet. Some enjoyable diversions aside - see The Replacement - this season sees the death of Buffy's mother Joyce, and tackles issues such as self-harm and depression in a way that previous seasons really only touched upon - it's almost like a nightmarish document on the human condition. Add the sudden, inexplicable presence of Dawn and you've got a unique new perspective on this battle between good and evil.

@{b}Season Six Episodes@{ub}

Season six might as well be an extension of season five - dealing with the aftermath of everything that went on, not least Buffy's death. This season has easily the most disturbing moment the show has ever seen - Spike's attempt to rape Buffy. Also because Buffy was dead, there was much speculation about whether this season would materialise. Bringing her back would prove hard for Joss & co to pull off while satisfying the fans, and some would rather the show went out with a bang, than being reduced to a kludge like The X-Files has since David Duchovny lost interest. It manages, however, to kick arse in time-honoured fashion.

@node "ABOUTGUIDE" "Buffy.guide: About"

@{b}About Buffy.guide@{ub}

Hey guys... it's been so long I've forgotten how to upload to Aminet! :O) If you still give a shit about this, e-mail me! By way of explanation for my absence, some really nasty shit happened to me last year, plus I left college so my internet access is extremely limited: 15 minutes at the library now and then, which is only up the road now since I @{i}moved out!! @{ui} No more stepdad anymore. Another change is that now I'm using UAE... Miggy's right by my side but I can't afford a gfx card, so UAE & P96 is way faster at the moment, plus my Miggy's RMB is broke :O( It's funny how a PC, sitting idle, crashes sometimes. And AmigaOS runs faster under emulation on x86 than "native" Windows. I also gave up the cider drinking :O) My friend I used to drink with, he's a speed-freak now, so whatever. I had to get away from that fucker.

I'm not sure about the fate of the HTML version... It always looked way nicer than the guide but was much less functional, and I have other things to do like write songs and paint than wade through the most disgusting hypertext ever written. The guide was already a mess by the time of the last release - I had kept on top of the new episodes but neglected areas like character info, so to get it in shape I've probably spent 80 hours... Partly because for season five and six, I've been writing my own outlines. I really don't know why, since it would be quicker to copy them off the Buffy site. Some of the new outlines just lack warmth, they're no fun to read. It takes me at least 100 mins to write one synopsis, sitting here next to the VCR. The outlines I didn't write have still been edited, to clarify some points or to add details. Some mistakes may remain, but they're fixed on discovery.


@{b}How to use this guide@{ub}

Buffy The Vampire Slayer Guide is designed for the AmigaGuide© system. If you aren't familiar with AmigaGuide, try clicking on the Help button at the top of the AmigaGuide window.

There are several ways of navigating around this guide:

@{u}Browsing through the main page@{uu}
The main page has a list of all the Buffy episodes that I currently have information on. Click on the links to read outlines and comments for your chosen episode. @{"Click here" LINK "MAIN"} to go to the main page.

@{u}Using the browse buttons@{uu}
All the episode nodes are in the correct order, so you can read the whole Buffy story from start to finish by using the Browse buttons. Character info nodes are also in alphabetical order.

@{u}Using the index@{uu}
I've supplied an @{"index" LINK "BUFFYINDEX"} for the episode names, so you can search for episodes alphabetically. This can also be accessed at any time using the index button at the top of the AmigaGuide window.

@{u}Using a string search@{uu}
Matthew Fletcher's BuffyGuideSearch tool is included in the archive, which Buffy.guide requires to execute a string search. Click on the @{"String Search" SYSTEM "newcli WINDOW=CON:20/20/400//Buffy from Buffy.guide.cli"} button to start a new search, or on the @{"?" LINK "SEARCHREADME"} button to view Matthew's readme. You should @{b}never@{ub} rename Buffy.guide, because the search tool won't be able to find it. If you have problems using the search, see the troubleshooting section below.

@{u}Using the Major Buffy Events list@{uu}
This is a chronological list of all the events of particular significance in the Buffy story, eg. Angel's first kiss with Buffy. @{"Click here" LINK "EVENTS"} to check it out.


@{b}Other information available in the guide@{ub}

@{u}Character Profiles@{uu}
A collection of profiles, odd articles, etc., on the characters (heroes, villains and otherwise) in Buffy and their corresponding actors. Character Profiles also now includes all the guys from the old Death Row section - I figured if you're looking for a character by name you may not know which side they're on, plus some of them are ambiguous, Spike for instance. @{"Click here" LINK "CHARACTERPROFILES"} to view the Character Profiles page.

@{u}Vamp Vocabulary@{uu}
A Slayer-Speak glossary. Handy if you want to sound like one of the Scooby gang. Accessible via the @{"Main page" LINK "MAIN"}, or @{"click here" LINK "VAMPVOC"} to go to the Vamp Vocab page.

@{u}Buffy Marathon@{uu}
An insane experiment in the immersive experience of Buffywatching. Not one of those scary stalker things, @{"here" LINK "BUFFYMARATHON"} I talk about watching the entire existing backlog of Buffy episodes in one sitting - breaking only to pee - to see if it drives me insane.


@{b}Problems with the guide@{ub}

I cannot possibly test Buffy.guide on every configuration. Although it works great on my Amiga, here is a quick run-down of the problems you could face:

@{b}Problem:@{ub}  The buttons etc. aren't lined up properly
@{b}Solution:@{ub}  You need XHelvetica.font/11 on your system. This is part of the MagicWB package, so I assumed most people have access to that font. If it's not there, AmigaGuide® will fall back to your system default text, which will be fixed-width and mess up the tabs. You can try changing the font tag on line 5 using a text-editor.

@{b}Problem:@{ub}  The search button won't work!
@{b}Solution:@{ub}  Check that:
1.    The files BuffyGuideSearch, Buffy.guide.cli and Buffy.guide.search are in the BuffyGuide drawer
2.    You have MultiView (or a replacement with the same name) installed on your system
3.    You have a 68020 or better processor!
4.    The protection flags of BuffyGuideSearch are set to RWED (default)
5.    You are using the AmigaGuide system to view the guide, as opposed to WinGuide on a PC, which obviously cannot run AmigaOS programs like the search tool
6.    NewCLI is in your path, or in ROM (OS2+). This is the least likely to cause problems.

@{b}Problem:@{ub}  Sometimes depending on the size of the AmigaGuide® window, links dissappear and are replaced by strange symbols!
@{b}Solution:@{ub}  It has happened to me once or twice. A bug in AmigaGuide®, which I, of course, cannot fix! You may also notice that web URLs aren't correctly wrapped, for a similar reason - it's just the way that AmigaGuide® handles wrapping (ie. badly).

@{b}Problem:@{ub}  There's a broken link in your guide!
@{b}Solution:@{ub}  Contact me and I'll fix it (give as much info as possible). I do have a links checker so this shouldn't happen, but it's possible that a link takes you to the wrong page, so keep an eye out for that...

@{b}Problem:@{ub}  The guide looks weird when I view it on Winguide on the PC, or an old version of AmigaGuide®. I also find I can't use the search facility.
@{b}Solution:@{ub}  Winguide has no support for system commands or for wordwrap. Both of these facilities are required to view BuffyGuide at its best. All I can say is that if you give the author some feedback they might be motivated into adding wordwrap... Just use UAE if you really must view it on a PC.


@{b}FAQ@{ub}

@{b}Q:@{ub}  Buffy the what...?
@{b}A:@{ub}  Maybe you're in the wrong place, dude! Well if you're new to the series then you should be able to learn a lot from this guide. Start at the beginning, and read through to the end, I guess...

@{b}Q:@{ub}  Why do you need version numbers for an episode guide?!
@{b}A:@{ub}  The main purpose of the version numbers is so you know whether of not you have the latest version of the guide. I know it seems a little daft, but as a measure of how Buffy.guide has evolved, it works. I won't pretend I know the first thing about version numbers :O)

@{b}Q:@{ub}  Where can I find information on what might happen in the future of Buffy?
@{b}A:@{ub}  Visit @{u}www.buffyslayer.com@{uu}, go to the postings board and there's usually someone around there looking in a big crystal ball. Or probably talking to their aunt Mildred who works in the make-up department...

@{b}Q:@{ub}  How can I help you with the Buffy guide?
@{b}A:@{ub}  Thanks for asking. I need someone to tell me how to link to individual sections of an AmigaGuide node when line numbers don't work because it's driving me insane. Also does anyone know how to wordwrap in FrexxEd? Any incorrect information that you spot in the guide, I'd like you to email me about. Don't just think everyone else will because unfortunatly then no-one does. If you are my best friend ever, you will send any of this info to @{u}chris.sheffeild@talk21.com@{uu} !!

@{b}Q:@{ub}  How do I install Buffy.guide?
@{b}A:@{ub}  Buffy.guide is best kept with all it components, in a drawer called BuffyGuide, which can be kept wherever you like. When you unpack BuffyGuide.lha, LhA should create a drawer called BuffyGuide, and you should be able to drag this drawer wherever you like.

@{b}Q:@{ub}  Are you a Buffy expert?
@{b}A:@{ub}  No way! The only Buffy expert is Joss, man.

@{b}Q:@{ub}  Are you infringing copyright by making an AmigaGuide® of this information?
@{b}A:@{ub}  I sure hope not. There's an X-Files guide doing the rounds and as far as I know there have been no objections to that. As for using other people's episode descriptions... Well, I included all the credits that were on the web (unlike the author of certain other guides, no names mentioned!) so I don't see any problem. Besides, I'm promoting Buffy :-)

@{b}Q:@{ub}  How do I write to one of the stars?
@{b}A:@{ub}  Their Name, c/o Buffy the Vampire Slayer, c/o The Warner Brothers Television Network, 4000 Warner Blvd., Burbank, CA 91522

@{b}Q:@{ub}  Can I link to the Buffy website? How?
@{b}A:@{ub}  Use this code to link, using the button on the Buffy server:

@{fg shine}<a href="http://www.buffy.com"><img src="http://www.buffy.com/bronze/buffybanner.gif" width="468" height="60" alt="Visit The Buffy the Vampire Slayer Official Web Site" border=1 ></a>@{fg text}

@{b}Q:@{ub}  Who are the people who post at the Buffy website who seem to be connected to the show?
@{b}A:@{ub}	@{u}Screen Name@{uu}			@{u}Identity@{uu}

	joss				Joss Whedon - Creator of Buffy
	Ty King				Ty King - writer
	Jeff Pruitt			Jeff Pruitt - stunt coordinator
	RD				Secret guy from David Greenwalt's office
	Seth Green			Seth Green (Oz) - actor
	Alyson (Willow)			Alyson Hannigan - actress
	Apollo - Buffy Web Support Team	Webmaster of the site
	Erika Amato (Velvet Chain)		Lead singer of a band appearing in Buffy
	SCOUT				Secret person from the show

I don't know who the secret people are... I've never personally seen any of them post either.

@{b}Q:@{ub}  I don't like all the American spellings. You should correct them to real English.
@{b}A:@{ub}  Cue my old left-wing English student rant: Oh, "Real" English?! Why is 'Colour' any more correct than 'Color'? Spelling is entirely arbitrary (look at the word Knight and then try telling me you pronounce it exactly as it's spelt!) and therefore not worth arguing about. Plus it's an American show, for crying out loud!

@{b}Q:@{ub}  That's a weird attitude, since you're an ex-English language student!
@{b}A:@{ub}  As a linguist, I describe; I do not prescribe. Dude. But don't worry, English spellings like "mum" and "arse" will appear in the bits I write. Because I am from England!


@{b}Suggested soundtrack to this guide:@{ub}

Minor Threat, Deicide, Q And Not U, Nirvana, Angels In The Architecture, Aina, Tribute To Nothing, Maple, The Get Up Kids, Life Of Agony, Texas Is The Reason, Million Dead, Rival Schools, Fugazi, Hell Is For Heroes, Small Brown Bike, Twelve Hour Turn, Thrice, Sepultura, Jimmy Eat World, Garrison, Dead Kennedys, Zeidun, Fishtake, At The Drive-In, Green Day, Hot Water Music, Poison The Well, Bluetip, Voivod, Onelinedrawing, Taproot, Alice In Chains, Annalise, Carcass, Weezer, Glassjaw, Rites Of Spring, Deftones...

@node "BUFFYTHEMOVIE" "Buffy.guide: Buffy The Vampire Slayer (Movie)"

@{b}Buffy The Vampire Slayer@{ub}
(The Movie)

Surprisingly few people know about the Buffy movie (released in 1992, four years before the series started) and fewer have watched it so I've decided to write a synopsis for the film. Viewers hoping for one and a half hours of big-screen Sarah Michelle Gellar will be greatly dissappointed (Buffy is played by Kristy Swanson), and of course there's no Willow, Xander or Giles.

Joss Whedon wasn't happy with the way the film eventually turned out because it was so far removed from his original vision. Critics view the film as a major flop and it's screened only when Channel 5 run out of things to play for the 9 o'clock movie slot. So if you can't get hold of it (or would rather imagine Sarah doing Buffy's vamp-dusting deeds) here's the basic outline...

...Uh, sometime soon. *Cough* Y'know, during my hiatus i saw this for sale on DVD. Didn't buy it. Stoopid! Here's a little blurb I found from Blackstar.co.uk in the meantime...

The movie that started it all. Blonde, bouncy Buffy (Kristy Swanson) is your typical high school cheerleader - her goal is to "marry a star and die" and nothing gets in her way when its time to shop. But all that changes when a strange man (Donald Sutherland) informs her she's been chosen by fate to kill vampires. With the help of a romantic rebel (Luke Perry), Buffy is soon spending school nights protecting L.A. from Lothos, the vampire king (Rutger Hauer), his sidekick, Lefty (Paul Reubens), and their determined gang of bloodsuckers. It's everything you'd expect from a teen queen in the valley.

@{b}Buffy The Vampire Slayer@{ub}
(Pilot episode)

@{i}Thanks to Antony Dzeryn for writing this synopsis and accompanying information.@{ui}

At night, two teenagers break into Sunnydale High.  The boy, a former student, takes the girl he is with into a drama theatre, where they kiss.  However, the girl is jumpy, and seems convinced that someone is watching them.  When they have made sure that there is no-one around, her face suddenly becomes distorted.  She reveals herself to be a vampire, and kills him by sucking his blood.

The next morning, we are introduced to the cast, one by one, as we follow bubblegum-blowing Buffy through her first day in a new school.  She is met by Principal Flutie, who tells her some of the school's regulations, in-between repeatedly forgetting her name.  Next we meet Xander, who is immediately attracted to her, describing her as "new and improved" with a lascivious glint in his eye.  Rupert Giles, the librarian, is then introduced.  Buffy tries to ask him for some books to help her catch up with her classes, but Giles produces an ancient book bearing the legend "Vampyr".  She tells him that she is "way sure" that she was not looking for that book, before running away.

Next we meet short, dumpy, but intelligent Willow, and the superficial Cordelia, who is constantly surrounded by two other equally vapid girls.  This meeting ends prematurely when Buffy learns that a boy has been murdered and dumped in the girl's locker room.  Buffy investigates, and finds two small puncture marks on the corpse's neck.  She runs back to the library, but only to tell Giles that she is not interested in vampires, and that in coming to a new town she hoped to leave them behind her.  Giles retorts by reminding her that she is the Slayer, and thus it is her duty to slay not only vampires, but also whatever other demons present themselves.  Buffy says she is still not interested, and leaves, as the camera cuts to a confused Xander behind a bookcase.

Later, queuing for the Bronze, Xander tells Buffy that Willow has a date with a pale boy, dressed like Lionel Richie.  Buffy guesses that it is a vampire, and runs back to the school, where she rescues Willow from a gang of the undead.

In the final scene, Giles berates Buffy for letting one of the vampires get away, for revealing her identity as the Slayer, and for simply being a "teen thing".  Buffy tells him not to worry, and expertly throws her stake into the centre of a poster of Nosferatu.

@{b}Bad Things@{ub}

This episode is difficult to describe in terms of plot, as what little plot it has is very basic.  It is more of a "let's meet the characters" episode than a plot-driven one.  American shows generally have four plots which run concurrently; an "A" plot, which is the focus of the episode, a "B" plot, which is the main sub-plot, and "C" and "D" plots, though the "D" plot is often omitted.  This episode contains just the "A" plot, the invariably weak "meet-the-characters" part (see the first episode of "Crusade" for an equally excruciatingly-bad example), the "B" plot, the dead boy, and a skeletal "C" plot, the "hey, I'm the Slayer" part.  The finished episode fleshed out the "C" plot, by having Giles meet Buffy in the Bronze, and the introduction of Jesse.  It also added the "D" plot, the Harvest.

Fundamentally, this episode is "Welcome to the Hellmouth" with all of the Buffy goodness taken out; it is like a dress-rehearsal.  It does not have any incidental music, the actors' delivery of their lines is very flat, and they have not yet managed to entirely develop their characters.  Buffy's character is darker than it is in the series; though no mention is made of her burning down her old gym, there is the suggestion that she has seen and done much worse.  Giles is either slightly more mystical, or simply more wimpish, depending on your reading of the character.  Xander and Cordelia, on the other hand, just need a little more confidence in themselves.  Willow is a different matter entirely.  The actress' interpretation of the part bears no resemblance to the real Willow.  Her acting is wooden at best, and the episode suffers enormously from Alyson Hannigan's absence.

The writing has also yet to mature.  This episode forms the bridge between the occasionally cringingly-bad film and the generally superb series, as the standard of writing wavers erratically. The on-going gag, that Flutie cannot remember Buffy's name, is rather embarrassing.  However, in the same breath he sympathetically describes his feelings about the dead boy as "that thing like when you burp and you got that vomity taste in your mouth", which is classic Whedon and should have made it into the episode proper.

The effects are similarly poor, though this, like the absence of incidental music, is understandable.  Why waste money on a series that might not get made?

@{b}Good Things@{ub}

The "vomity taste" exchange makes the episode worth seeing, and it is interesting to have seen what might have been, had Alyson not been cast as Willow.  There is also a scene where Xander points out all of the different social groups in the school to Buffy, including the "Howzers", who would be "genuine hard-core gangsters, 'cept for the upper-class white-guy stigma", the "way-gesturey" theatre club (visual gag only), and the film club, who spend their time "deciding that every movie is an existential meditation on Freudian sexuality" (the same is true of English degree students).

Finally, there is one stand-out shot where Buffy somersaults from the top of the spiral staircase in the library to the floor below.  Rather than just show her begin to jump, and then her feet landing, as is often the case in the series, the whole stunt is shown.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Willow is played by a different actress.
The episode only lasts approximately 25 minutes, as opposed to 45 minutes for a "proper" episode.
Principal Flutie is played by a different actor.
There is no Master, Darla, Jesse or Angel.
Several of the supporting cast are present, though, including Harmony and Jonathan.
"Dingoes Ate My Baby" are playing at the Bronze.
Principal Flutie's forgetfulness regarding Buffy's name is possibly a reference to the fact that the studio bosses were not happy with the unusual name "Buffy".
The library set is different.  It looks like the set for the Bronze, complete with metal spiral staircase, and must have been re-dressed before "Welcome to the Hellmouth" was made.

"If we don't find her, there's gonna be one more dead body in the morning." - Buffy

Sixteen-year-old @{"Buffy Summers" LINK "ABOUTBUFFY"} has moved to Sunnydale from L.A., hoping to leave her troubled past behind. But Sunnydale High librarian @{"Rupert Giles" LINK "ABOUTGILES"} knows who Buffy is: she is The Slayer, the one girl in all the world with the strength and skill to hunt and kill vampires. He knows about her past because he is her new Watcher - the person whose destiny it is to train and guide Slayers on their path. Buffy quickly makes two friends: the shy, bookish @{"Willow" LINK "ABOUTWILLOW"}, and the goofy but loveable @{"Xander" LINK "ABOUTXANDER"}, who is instantly attracted to Buffy.

When a student is found dead in a locker - with bite marks on his neck and completely drained of his blood - Giles enlists Buffy's help. She resists, trying to get out of the slaying game for good, but Giles insists that a crucial mystical upheaval is about to occur. Little do they know, a bewildered Xander overhears their conversation - Buffy's secret is out. Later, in a dark, eerie chamber, we see a vampire who seems to be confirming Giles' prophecy. The vampire, Luke, kneels in front of a pool of blood and says, "The sleeper will awaken. And the world will bleed."

On her way to the Bronze, Sunnydale's hippest (and only) club, Buffy is followed by a handsome, mysterious stranger. He tells her she must be ready for the Harvest, and gives her a small cross. Giles meets her at the Bronze and she tells him about the encounter. Giles convinces her to use her power, and wants her to try to sense if there are any vampires in the room. She does sense one and finds him talking to Willow, but the two have walked away. Trying to catch him unawares, she grabs a makeshift stake, turns a corner and attacks... @{"Cordelia" LINK "ABOUTCOR"}, the snootiest girl in school, who already thought Buffy was a loser for hanging with Willow. Now she thinks Buffy's certifiable. We see Jesse, Xander's buddy, chatting with a girl we saw in vampire garb earlier, but who now appears as a normal student, Darla. Back to the pool of blood, something breaks through the surface and rises: the demonic Master Vampire. He is hungry and weak, and asks Luke to bring him something young.

Outside the Bronze, Buffy enlists Xander's help in finding Willow, who's already been lead to a mausoleum by the vampire. Willow's happy to find Jesse there, until she sees that Darla has already bitten him in the neck. Buffy and Xander enter, and Buffy promptly kills the vampire boy. Now Willow is finally in on the secret. While Darla tries to attack Buffy, Xander and Willow lead a weakened Jesse out. Luke joins the battle and throws Buffy across the room. When Buffy tries to get up, Luke pounces on her and tries to bite into her neck... @{"[to be continued...]" LINK "THEHARVEST"}

@{b}More Information@{ub}

Welcome to the Hellmouth is a typical introductory episode which spends more time familiarising the audience with the main characters, and explaining the premise. The series picks up more or less where the @{"Buffy The Vampire Slayer movie" LINK "BUFFYTHEMOVIE"} ended, but sensibly assumes that the viewer won't have seen it. All the various elements are juggled with consummate skill. Writer Joss Whedon still finds time to work in plot strands that will be taken up in the next episode, while admirably driving the narrative forward.

First impressions are very favourable. The main characters are appealing, and the show's premise is commendably unusual. This is hardly surprising, as most of the bugs were worked out by the @{"feature film" LINK "BUFFYTHEMOVIE"}, and an elusive untransmitted pilot episode. At this stage, the characters seem fairly stock, (the computer nerd, the stuffy British librarian, etc), but they're quickly fleshed out in the next couple of episodes. Even in the era that's given us The X-Files and countless inferior spin- offs, there's no show that's directly comparable to Buffy.

@{b}The Harvest@{ub}
4V02

Follows on from @{"Welcome to the Hellmouth" LINK "WELCOMETOHELLMOUTH"}.

As Luke tries to bite Buffy in the neck, he burns his hand on her cross, giving her a chance to escape. She finds her friends struggling with several vampires. Buffy impales one and the others flee. Meanwhile, Jesse has been taken to the Master, who hears about Buffy. By her strength, he can tell that she's the Slayer. The Master knows that Buffy will come looking for Jesse, and then she will be his.

Giles enlists Willow to check the internet for more information about the Harvest, while Buffy decides to go look for Jesse. At the mausoleum, she runs into the stranger again, whose name is @{"Angel" LINK "ABOUTANGEL"}. He warns that the Harvest will be that night. Then Buffy is shocked to find Xander has followed her. They find Jesse, who tries to lead them out, until he turns to face them and they discover he's become a vampire. More vampires surround and chase them, but they manage to escape to the street through a grating. The Master is furious that the Slayer has escaped. But he allows Luke to feed from him as a way of gaining strength for himself. He dabs some of his blood on Luke's forehead and paints a three-pointed star.

Willow's research explains that on the night of the Harvest, the Master Vampire can draw power from one of his minions while it feeds and then can break through from their reality to ours. The minion is called the Vessel, and bears the symbol we saw painted on Luke.

Xander guesses the vampires will converge on the Bronze, since it's always filled with young people. That night, a newly confident Jesse strides into the Bronze and hits on Cordelia, who actually allows the former loser to dance with her. Soon, a gang of vampires takes over the club, with Luke at the helm. By the time Buffy, Giles, Xander and Willow get there, the suckfest is in full swing, with the Master gaining strength from each victim. Buffy manages to kill a few other vampires, then Jesse winds up impaling himself on a stake a frightened Xander was holding. Buffy breaks a large window, trying to make Luke think the streetlight is daylight, which will destroy him. He buys it for a second, and she takes advantage of his confusion by driving a stake through his back. Now the Master is too weak to break through to the other side, and Sunnydale has been spared. This time.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

This episode continues on from @{"Welcome to the Hellmouth" LINK "WELCOMETOHELLMOUTH"} (the first two 45 minute episodes were shown together when the series premiered in the US). With the introductions out of the way, things begin to settle down, and this is much more like a typical episode in structure, carefully balancing a well-developed plot with rich character development.

The Harvest has more time to breathe, giving writer Whedon room for his witty Clueless-like patois and for interesting set-pieces, like the scene where Willow and Xander catch themselves discussing vampires as casually as they might once have debated that day's lunch menu.

This episode also steps up a gear, with the show's first proper fight scene (not counting the fight scene in the @{"pilot episode" LINK "PILOT"}), when Luke and Buffy tangle. These beautifully choreographed stunt sequences are always exciting, and, if shot properly, the visceral payoff to many episodes. It's hard not to love a show where one of the undead is decapitated by a cymbal thrown like a Frisbee. It's obvious that the series is still developing at this stage, but the characters are already well-sketched. Giles, struggling with the concept that Buffy and her entourage might be humanity's last line of defence against the forces of darkness, sighs that "The Earth is doomed!"

4V03

Buffy, in an attempt to bring some normality into her complicated life, decides to try out for cheerleader. When she goes to the big tryout, she meets a quiet girl named Amy. As one girl auditions, she gets more and more into her routine, and suddenly her hands begin to smoke. Buffy knocks her to the ground and puts the girl's smoking hands out. Amy tells Buffy that her mother was a cheerleading star and she feels pressure to make the squad. When Amy leaves, Willow says it's a lot more than pressure - she thinks Amy's mom is a tyrant. Neither Amy nor Buffy is chosen as part of the regular squad - both are alternates. Amy is distraught when she is only chosen to be third alternate - with Buffy as first alternate.

In a spooky attic with a cauldron, someone is casting spells with dolls. The next day, snooty Cordelia Chase, who has made cheerleader, is temporarily blinded while taking her driving test. Giles thinks Amy's a witch, but the only way to prove it is to form a potion and pour it on her - if her skin turns blue, she is a witch. Buffy, Xander and Willow join forces to test this theory in chemistry class, and Giles is proven correct. Then another cheerleader has a mysterious accident, and when Amy reacts to it with horror, it makes Buffy doubt whether Amy realizes what she's doing. Amy comes home in a huff to find her mother on the couch watching TV. She tells her mother to write her history report. We see that Amy is holding an ID bracelet which Xander gave Buffy for good luck at the cheerleading tryouts - Buffy will be Amy's next victim.

As first alternate, Buffy is now on the cheerleading squad, and starts acting strangely during practice. When she tosses another cheerleader across the room, it's time for the next alternate to come in - Amy. Buffy suddenly becomes weak, and Giles says the only way to keep her from dying is to get Amy's spell book. Willow and Xander stay at school to keep an eye on Amy. Giles and Buffy force their way into Amy's house, and Buffy discovers that the woman they're speaking to is not really Amy's mother but Amy herself. The mother switched their bodies so she could relive her glory days as a cheerleader. Giles finds the spell book, and they all troop off to school, where "Amy" is getting ready to cheer. As Giles chants, "Amy" becomes weaker as the transformation begins. "Amy" charges out of the gym to find Buffy and kill her. Just as she's about to get her, the transformation is complete. "Amy" is now the real Amy, and the mother goes berserk. She starts to cast an evil spell on Buffy, but Buffy deflects it with a mirror and sends it back to the mother, who disappears. Everything seems to be back to normal, until we catch a glimpse of the mother's cheerleader trophy in a school display case. Its eyes are moving...

@{b}More information@{ub}

An episode featuring Sunnydale High's cheerleaders was an obvious one, but here it's given a typical Buffy The Vampire Slayer spin to create something more unusual than you might find under similar circumstances in other teen-based shows. The allusions to the cheerleaders being a cult are particularly pleasing. Sadly, it's a rather predictable episode, blessed with only one significant plot twist. The first signs of the Buffy / Willow / Xander love triangle appear here. Xander is becoming besotted with Buffy, whilst sidelining Willow with the unintentionally dismissive "you're my guy for the knows-about-girls stuff." Dana Reston's script doesn't sparkle like Whedon's two episodes, and often lacks subtlety. One element that does work well is the contrast between Buffy's relationship with her mother, and Amy and hers.

The depiction of witchcraft, replete with bubbling cauldrons and voodoo dolls, is surely a rather Hollywood concoction, reminiscent of the pseudo-magic in movies like 'The Craft'. The results are rather gruesome but well within the usual television restrictions: Amber's hands erupting into flame; Cordelia's blindness; and their classmate struck dumb are all rather simply accomplished, but nonetheless effective. Cordelia is given her first real exposure here, (following her brief introduction in @{"Welcome To The Hellmouth" LINK "WELCOMETOHELLMOUTH"}), in a nice character-building scene. When Giles asks "Why would someone want to harm Cordelia?", Willow has one suggestion: "Because they met her?"

The best scenes, though, belong to the light-headed Buffy, who must be great fun at a party!

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Pop Culture: There's a reference to the Nickelodeon TV program 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' by Buffy: "The test was positive, she's our Sabrina."

@{b}Chris's Notes@{ub}

On the BBC website and (I think) the Buffy Website, this episode is named 'The Witch' (hence its name in this guide)... but according to the season one box-set the title is simply 'Witch'.

@{b}Teacher's Pet@{ub}
4V04

Buffy's kindly biology teacher, Dr. Gregory, is attacked after class by a giant praying mantis, but as far as the students know, their teacher is just missing. The mysterious Angel appears at the Bronze that night to warn Buffy about a pending attack. His arm looks as if it was cut by a tiger's claw. The next day, Dr. Gregory's class is being taught by a substitute teacher - the pretty Miss Natalie French, who drives Xander ga-ga. She tells the class about the science fair, and asks for volunteers to help her create a model of a praying mantis egg sacks - after school. As expected, Xander's hand shoots up, as does football heart-throb Blayne's and every other boy in the class. Miss French decides that Blayne can be her assistant that afternoon, and Xander the next. Later in the cafeteria, Cordelia opens the fridge to discover Dr. Gregory's headless body. Buffy speculates that Angel's warning and his unusual wound have something to do with Dr. Gregory's gruesome murder, so she stakes out the park. She sees a vampire with one arm that has three sharp claws where the hand should be. The creature approaches Miss French, who is walking by with grocery bags, but instead of pouncing on her, he sniffs her and runs away in terror.

Buffy catches the teacher turning her head around - all the way around. Buffy finally figures it out: Miss French is a praying mantis! Following her lead, Giles tries to get in touch with a friend in England who's an expert in the field - the only catch being that the man is institutionalized. Meanwhile, hacker par excellence Willow has found that Blayne's mother has reported him missing. Since it's Xander's turn to work with Miss French this afternoon, Buffy warns him, but he thinks Buffy is just jealous. Miss French gives Xander a drink as soon as he shows up. As he's getting dizzy, he thinks he hears someone calling, but she ignores it. She takes his hand, and her arm turns into a praying mantis' foreleg. He promptly passes out, and he is dragged away by Miss French. When he comes to, he finds himself in a cage in Miss French's cellar, with Blayne in an adjoining cage. Surrounded by headless bodies in cages, he calls to Miss French, who has now completely converted into her giant-mantis form.

After talking to his strait-jacketed friend, Giles confirms there is a creature called a She-Mantis, who lures male virgins to her nest. An extremely powerful foe, it was the She-Mantis who put Giles' friend into his deranged condition. Buffy suggests that Giles record some bat sonar from the video library - playing that for the She-Mantis will disrupt her nervous system. Exhausting other methods, Buffy decides to enlist Claw Guy to help her sniff out the She-Mantis. Going from door to door, he finally winces when they reach the correct house. Turning on her, he tries to attack Buffy, who promptly kills him with a fence slat. Buffy enters the basement and uses a few blasts of the insecticide to send her scurrying off, then plays the bat sonar. The tape has the desired effect on the crazed insect, enabling Buffy to hack it to death with a machete. We think this is the end of the She-Mantis until we catch a glimpse of the inside of Dr. Gregory's classroom closet, where a glistening egg sack is stirring at the bottom.

@{b}More information@{ub}

With a kooky plot, Teacher's Pet struggles to tread new ground, as if the producers were having trouble coming to terms with a story that wasn't simply about Buffy and the vampires. It's also uncomfortably paced, with several elements that seem to have been tagged on to a short script, to bring it up to the regulation length. The plot strands involving the fork-handed vampire, the diversion to visit the real Miss French, and Xander's guitar-playing daydream (They don't think it's kind of a clue that Xander is falling in love with Buffy? - Ed) all seem superfluous. David Greenwalt's script brings some new dimensions to Xander's character, but emphasises the more buffoonish aspects. To compensate there are a few delightful moments, including Cordelia explaining that some good has come of Doctor Gregory's death, (the discovery of his headless body in the canteen refrigerator has put her off her food and she's lost seven ounces!), and the mental image conjured by Giles' description of his strait-jacketed colleague, Carlisle.

The effects for the She-Mantis are very effective, helped no doubt by the dingy lighting in Miss French's basement. It would have been more satisfying though if there had been more interaction between the She-Mantis and Buffy during the episode's finale.

"She is the strangest girl!" - Giles, Owen

In the middle of a late-night sparring session at the cemetery, Buffy and Giles discover a ring with a mysterious engraving in it. The scene shifts to the Master Vampire's lair, where the Master explains that the Anointed One - the Master's greatest warrior and the Slayer's greatest foe is due to rise from the ashes of five dead. The next day, Buffy is asked out by a handsome, poetry-loving classmate named Owen who she is smitten with. Buffy's good mood is spoiled by Giles, who's connected the engraving in the ring to a violent prophecy which is about to be fulfilled... that night. Buffy very reluctantly joins Giles at the cemetery, but nothing happens there. Meanwhile, an airport van crashes and although the five passengers - including a burly, tattooed man who's been ranting incoherently - survive the wreck, they die when the van is overtaken by vampires.

The next day, Owen and Buffy decide to try again, much to Giles' (and a very jealous Xander's) chagrin.

As Buffy prepares for her date, Giles comes over with the news: five people were killed the night before, just as the prophecy described, and one of them - the tattooed man - was wanted for murder. This leads Giles to believe that he is the Anointed one. Buffy insists on going on to the Bronze with Owen, but Willow and Xander agree to go along with Giles to the Sunnydale Funeral Home so he can check the bodies for clues. Giles is greeted by vampires, and though Willow and Xander try to help him, they realize this is Buffy's domain. They run off to the Bronze to fetch her, but she's already hooked up with Owen. Unable to blurt out their news, they merrily suggest to Buffy a jaunt to the funeral home.

Once they get there, they're shocked to find Owen has followed them. As Buffy looks around for clues, the tattooed man - now a vampire - arises from a gurney and tears the place apart. Buffy kicks him, knocking him on a gurney, which hits the cremation oven and slides him right in. The next day, Owen is pumped up about the previous night's adventures and can't wait for the next date. Realizing she almost got him killed, Buffy reluctantly gives him the "let's be friends" speech. Giles commends her on her maturity, and reminds her that she did prevent a disaster. But all is not resolved. We see the Master in his lair, welcoming the Anointed one: it is an eight-year-old boy from the van accident, who smiles to reveal a mouth full of fangs.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

A somewhat doom-laden episode is spiced up with some interesting contrasts, and a number of very amusing scenes which compensate for the absence of an involving plot. Highlights include Xander trying to throw a spanner in Buffy's plans as she prepares for her date with Owen. The episode takes an age to get started: nothing of note happens in the first half of the episode, although we are granted an insight into the sorry state of Buffy's love life. It's hard to form any sort of relationship when you're likely to be called away at any moment to tackle the forces of evil. It seems that only people who are privy to Buffy's double life can get close to her.

The siege situation, where the team are defending the funeral home against hordes of the undead, is reminiscent of Assault on Precinct 13 and, more pertinently, the classic 1968 horror movie Night of the Living Dead. Sadly, director David Semel doesn't manage to fully exploit the full dramatic potential of the situation. Better staged is the vampire attack on the crashed bus which is very atmospheric. This is an episode that concentrates on underlining Buffy's responsibilities as the Slayer. Giles explains that he too has had to make sacrifices. In following the family tradition as a Watcher he had to abandon his cherished plans to become either a fighter pilot or, rather bizarrely, a grocer.

4V06

The students of Sunnydale High school are spending the afternoon at the zoo. Besides the standard zoo animals, this facility has a special new hyena exhibit, marked "Positively No Admittance." This piques the interest of Sunnydale's obnoxious cool crowd, who have already had their fun tormenting Buffy and a shy, bookish student named Lance. After grabbing poor Lance's notebook, they enter the forbidden hyena house, forcing him to follow. Xander, worried about his timid classmate, decides to come to his rescue. As they wait for Xander, Buffy and Willow meet an eccentric zookeeper, who claims the hyenas can understand human speech - they learn people's names, call out to them, and then eat them. Meanwhile, the crowd in the hyena house starts to get rough with Lance, but suddenly their eyes start flashing yellow - apparently, they've stepped into a mystical circle on the floor and a transformation has taken place. We see the eyes of one student who never meant to be there, and they're flashing yellow, too. It's Xander.

Back at school, Principal Flutie proudly introduces the students to Herbert, the Sunnydale Razorbacks' new mascot. Not quite as menacing as the team's namesake, Herbert is a actually a little pig. Xander elicits a strange reaction from Herbert when the two exchange a glance. Since returning from the zoo trip, he is more confident, more aggressive, and generally not the same old Xander. His love-sick puppy stares have turned to animal leers - he has even taken to sniffing Buffy.

Willow brings the news to Buffy and Giles that Herbert is dead - the pint-sized porker has been eaten by the hyena-possessed students. Buffy tries to confront Xander, but he becomes even more aggressive and pounces on her. They scuffle for a while, but Buffy finally decks him, and locks him into a steel book-return cage. When it is discovered that the pack is responsible for Herbert's demise, Principal Flutie is up in arms. He summons the group to his office to reprimand them, but doesn't get the chance.

The news horrifies everyone - Principle Flutie has been eaten! The "official" story is that a pack of wild dogs did it, but Buffy, Willow and Giles know the truth. Since Xander was with Buffy when the incident occurred, she is relieved that he was not involved. Giles has figured out that in order to restore order, the spirits of the hyenas must be taken from the students and put back into the animals. While Buffy and Giles go to the zoo, Willow offers to watch over Xander. The zookeeper, well-versed in these matters, offers to help with the "transformation," and says that all the students must return to the mystical circle in the hyena cage. But one member of their pack is missing - Xander - and Buffy and Giles realize, to their horror, that they will seek him out, leaving Willow vulnerable to their attack. When they do just that, Xander breaks free from the cage, but Willow hides. They escape the school grounds and Buffy leads them all to the zoo.

While everything seems to be going according to schedule, it turns out that the zookeeper's plan is to absorb all the hyena's spirits himself. He does, and grabs Willow in order to perform a predatory act which is part of the ritual. Xander, back to his old self, reacts to seeing his friend in jeopardy and dives on the zookeeper, freeing Willow. When the zookeeper goes after Buffy, she hurls him into the hyena cage, where he is promptly devoured.

This is a highly inventive episode with an unusual premise, albeit one that is somewhat difficult to believe. The supernatural elements are clumsily handled, and the Primals ability to transfer their spirits into their human hosts are not adequately explained. The ending seems rushed and muddled. It would have been nice if the story could have been stretched to allow scenes where the human hosts became even more animalistic but this would probably have necessitated elaborate - and expensive - make-up, and might have earned the episode an X-certificate. As it is, it comes pretty close to the knuckle anyway, with scenes that must have sent the censors scurrying for their rulebooks. The cannibalism element is not gratuitously exploited but it seems likely that viewers will be rather more saddened by the death of Hubert the pig than the demise of Principal Flutie.

Pop Culture: Buffy's line, "I can't believe that you of all people are trying to Scully me!" is a reference to Dana Scully, Agent Mulder's partner on 'The X-Files'. Scully is the most sceptical of the pair and was assigned to work with Mulder to keep his investigations grounded in reality.

4V07

On her way home from the Bronze, Buffy encounters three vampires, who've been sent to avenge the death of one of the Master's minions. Just as they're about to attack her, Angel appears and they begin to fight. Angel and Buffy manage to make it safely to her house, where she repairs the wound he got in the scuffle. He spends the night in her bedroom, sleeping next to her bed. The next day at school, Giles identifies Buffy's attackers as warrior vampires, and steps up her training in case a more serious melee takes place. Later that day, Buffy and Angel share a passionate kiss, but then to her horror, she sees that he is a vampire!

Angel meets up with Darla, who was his lover and partner in crime hundreds of years earlier. She chastises him for spending time with the Slayer. Meanwhile, Giles identifies Angel as a 240-year-old vampire who came to America 80 years ago, living alone and never killing again. Darla, anxious to do Buffy in, goes to her house and pretends to be a student planning to study with her. Buffy's mother, Joyce, lets her in and Darla promptly bites her in the neck. Angel enters the house and tells Darla to let Joyce go. Darla passes Joyce to him and he is tempted to bite her, but doesn't. When Buffy enters, she sees Angel holding her mother and, assuming he is the one who bit Joyce, she tosses him out the window. This finally gives her the impetus to kill him, and she meets him at the Bronze with a crossbow. He explains that he did many heinous deeds over the course of his lifetime, but his soul has been restored and he is now haunted by them. Darla finds them together and tries to shoot Buffy. Angel impales Darla from behind and she turns to dust. When the Master finds out that Darla, his favourite, has been slain, he goes berserk, but the Annointed One comforts him.

Back at the Bronze, Angel and Buffy agree that despite their strong feelings for each other, it's not realistic for them to pursue any kind of relationship. They kiss goodbye and when Buffy walks away, the imprint of her cross has been seared into Angel's chest.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

This episode begins with a nice piece of misdirection which suggests that the story will be about the three armour-plated vampire warriors. A less kind interpretation is that this part of the plot is simply padding. It's not long before this story is hastily abandoned, and the focus moves firmly to Angel.

At the beginning of the season, Angel seemed simply to be some sort of shadowy plot device who would turn up to drop hints to Buffy when the team had exhausted whatever leads they'd been pursuing. From this episode on, the redefined relationship between Angel and Buffy forms the backbone of the series. The revelations about Angel's past are only a taste of what's to come and it quickly becomes apparent that his relationship with the Slayer is going to be a troubled one. There's obvious chemistry between all the actors, not least between Gellar and Boreanaz, who start to smoulder in this episode.

The story is cleverly constructed, with several plot threads developing in parallel. At times the switching between the different settings becomes tiresome, and the pace seems to be maintained at the expense of frustrating the viewer. Two scenes are especially well handled: Darla stalking Joyce Summers, ("Would you like something to eat?"), and the kinetic, John Woo-style battle at the end of the episode. It's a shame to see Darla written out, especially as she was responsible for making Angel a vampire. "Angel" is a pivotal episode, rich in character-building detail, and one that serves the long-term interests of the series, but nevertheless it is rather mundane.

4V08

In the Middle Ages, a young man approaches a horned demon, who smiles at him and then breaks his neck. Later, a group of monks, outraged by the deed, chant in Latin, open a book and the demon is sucked into it - its pages now filled.

Back in the library, Buffy opens a crate and finds the long forgotten book. Along with Xander and Willow, the school's two computer experts are helping scan books: Fritz, a menacing looking bruiser, and Dave, a geekier kid. Also present is Miss Calendar, the computer science teacher, who rides Giles about his fear of technology. As Willow scans the ancient book, the characters disappear from its pages. When she looks away, words appear on the screen: "Where am I?"

A week later, Willow tells Buffy about Malcolm, a boy she's having an online romance with. Buffy, worried about her naive friend enlists Dave's help to try to find out more about Malcolm. Dave tells Buffy to leave Willow alone. Meanwhile, Miss Calendar stumbles upon the ancient book and asks Giles about its blank pages. When Giles notices the horned demon on the cover, he suspects trouble. Dave gets Buffy to look for Willow in the girls' locker room but when she gets there, Fritz has rigged up some wires in the shower to try to electrocute her. A puddle reaches the exposed wires and Buffy is sent flying into the locker room - the soles of her shoes smoldering. A shaken Dave tells the computer he can't kill Buffy. Angry at his disrespect, it types up a suicide note for him. Back in the library, Giles explains to Buffy and Xander that in the Dark Ages, the souls of demons were sometimes trapped in certain volumes, where they remained harmless until the pages were read aloud. When Willow scanned them, the demon, Moloch, was unleashed into the computer, and now has access to any computer in the world. Moloch preys on impressionable minds, which makes both Fritz and Dave vulnerable to his power. Buffy tries to delete Willow's files, hoping to "delete" Moloch along with them, but Moloch appears on the screen warning Buffy to stay away from Willow.

Looking for Willow in the computer lab, she finds Dave's body hanging, with the suicide note pinned to it. Fritz goes to Willow's house, chloroforms her and brings her to a mysterious warehouse where Dave had been spotted earlier. A desperate Giles asks Miss Calendar for help and discovers she has extensive knowledge of the mystical realm. She helps him repeat the spell the monks had chanted while she links up a configuration of different computers around the world. Meanwhile, Buffy and Xander try to save Willow at the warehouse. By the time they arrive, Moloch has left the computer and appears as a robotic incarnation of the horned demon that was back in the Dark Ages. He breaks Fritz' neck and is about to break Willow's when the spell takes hold, immobilizing him. Injured, but fighting, he lunges at Buffy, but she ducks and he punches a high-voltage junction box and dies of electrocution.

Although the plot is rather tired and seems to belong to the Cyberspace-obsessed eighties, it's given a unique Buffy The Vampire Slayer spin or three to create a very satisfying episode. There's an excellent pre-credits teaser which contrasts very nicely with the technological elements later in the episode.

"I Robot..." has a nice underlying message about the dissemination of information and how technology threatens to replace the printed word. Given later developments, it's surprising that Miss Calendar would advocate replacing books with data. Giles sums it up nicely: "If it's to last, the getting of knowledge should be tangible".

Willow gets a raw deal in an episode that centres on the character. It seems that her relationships both inside and outside the group are ill-fated. Alyson Hannigan gives a great performance in the first episode that gives her something meaningful to do.

The two versions of Moloch, the lizard-like original and the scrap metal variation, are superbly executed, imposing and magisterial. Making the library an integral element of the plot, rather than just somewhere where the gang congregate to chew the fat, is a refreshing change.

@{b}Chris's Notes@{ub}

Don't bother spending too long pausing your videos to get a glimpse at Buffy's birthdate (you thought I was gonna say ass, didn't you!)... two seperate dates are shown on-screen during the episode, 05/06/79 and 10/24/80. I don't know if her birth date is available anywhere (I probably wouldn't know if it was in this guide) but these probably weren't meant to be noticed.

"Did I mention that I hate this school?!" - Xander

Giles has been roped into supervising Sunnydale's talent show. When Buffy, Xander and Willow stop by to tease him about it, the new principal punishes them by insisting they come up with an act.

One of the dancers in the show is found dead, with her heart removed. The last person she was seen talking to was Morgan, a strange, awkward student who is a ventriloquist in the talent show with his dummy, Sid. When Buffy tries to question Morgan, he gets nervous and rubs his head. Sid seems to have a mind of his own, and Morgan talks to him as if he were real. Still suspicious, Buffy goes to check out Morgan's locker, but finds only the empty puppet case. When Buffy goes to sleep that night, Sid is outside her window. She feels him enter the room but when she screams and turns on the light, he's gone.

The next day, Giles tells Buffy, Xander and Willow about a brotherhood of demons who need human organs to maintain their humanity. Although this sounds like Morgan may have killed the dancer for her heart, these demons have super strength, while Morgan has been growing weaker. Willow discovers a book which says that dolls and mannequins are capable of becoming human by harvesting organs. Buffy, looking for Morgan in the prop room, finds him dead, with his brain removed. A light rig suddenly comes crashing down on her, and Sid is next to her with a kitchen knife. They have each mistaken the other for a demon. Sid explains that he was a human, but then was cursed, and he thinks the demon who cursed him is in the talent show. If he can kill that demon, he'll be free. Backstage at the talent show, Morgan's brain falls from the catwalk - apparently the demon has rejected it. Willow researches Morgan's records and finds out that he had brain cancer.

This means the demon is still going to be looking for a healthy, intelligent brain. We find Giles in the auditorium, innocently helping Marc, a student performing a magic act in the talent show. Marc convinces Giles to fill in for his assistant and lie down in a guillotine. Just as Giles realizes he's about to get his brains removed, Buffy runs in to save him. Marc changes into a demon, and Sid finally stabs him in the heart. Now that the demon is dead, the animated Sid turns back into a normal puppet. Suddenly, the curtain opens as a stunned audience attending the talent show looks at the dumbfounded gang on stage.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

The key to making this episode work is that the viewer should never be certain whether Sid is alive or not, and whether or not he is the killer. Ellen Pressman's surefooted direction means that this is handled with considerable skill. For example, the shot where Sid shifts position, as Morgan stows him inside the trunk, is subtle and could as easily be dismissed as a minor continuity blunder.

Unfortunately Pressman isn't entirely above cheating. The knee-level, point-of-view shots of the killer advancing towards Emily in the locker room are purposefully misleading. It's about two thirds of the way through the episode when the truth about Sid is revealed, releasing some of the tension, but giving the situation an extra twist that is typical of the series.

The running gag about Buffy, Willow and Xander being forced to participate in the talent show is very funny, and cements the episode's various elements together very nicely. 'The Puppet Show' is a very inventive episode, and one of the best of the first season.

Armin Shimerman is a wonderful addition to the series' semi-regular cast, bringing a cynicism that's all too often lacking in American shows.

"Could I be seeing his asteroid body?" - Buffy

Buffy has a nightmare about being attacked by the Master. Later in class, a student opens his book and spiders emerge and attack him, while a young boy stands outside the classroom window. In his lair, the Master explains to the Anointed One that fear is the most powerful force in the world, and changes are about to take place.

Buffy, Willow and Xander question the spider boy, who says he's had recurring nightmares about such attacks. Later, Buffy finds out from Cordy that there's a history test she's totally unprepared for. As soon as she starts writing, she glances at the clock and sees almost the entire hour is up, and the lesson is over before she has the chance to write her name on the paper. Again, the boy appears. Later, a girl goes into the school basement and is attacked by a huge Ugly Man. Questioned in the hospital, Laura is able to provide one clue: the attacker said the words "Lucky Nineteen" before attacking her.

Xander enters a class with Willow to find everyone staring at them - he's suddenly wearing only his boxer shorts. Buffy finds a newspaper picture of the boy who keeps appearing. The article says he's in a coma after falling down the steps after a little league game. Buffy notices his uniform number: 19. Giles says even though the boy's in the hospital, perhaps Buffy has been seeing his astral body, which can travel through time and space. Buffy's father picks her up at school and explains he left home because Buffy caused so much trouble and was a disappointment to him. He leaves Buffy in shock - and the boy appears again. Willow and Xander talk to Giles, who explains that their nightmares have been coming true, leaving everyone vulnerable to all sorts of danger. Buffy finally confronts the boy, who explains that Ugly Man wants to kill him. Suddenly, the Ugly Man appears and starts to attack Buffy, who is no match for him.

Giles warns Xander and Willow that Buffy's nightmares could be fatal, and they must find her. Willow's attempt leads her into her own nightmare: she is onstage in an opera for which she is woefully unprepared. Xander's search leads him to yet another nightmare: a clown he feared from childhood chases him with a knife. Buffy and the boy manage to escape Ugly Man by literally jumping from school during the day into a cemetery at night. The Master appears and shoves Buffy into an open grave. Willow, Xander and Giles need to find Buffy - unless Billy is woken up, all reality will become nightmares within hours.

They notice a cemetery - in darkness - is across the street, and go to investigate. Seeing Buffy's headstone, Giles laments not protecting her better, until Buffy emerges - as a vampire. Giles says it's reversible, if only Billy could wake up. They go to the hospital and Ugly Man appears again. Buffy manages to attack him. She asks the little boy to finish the job - he walks up to him and peels something off his face. In a flash, Buffy returns to normal, and the real little boy awakens from his coma. His little league coach enters and is shocked to find the boy awake. Buffy confronts him about beating up the boy for losing a game - when he tries to flee, Xander grabs him. Buffy's dad shows up after school and cheerfully greets her - another happy ending at the Hellmouth.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

In delving into the innermost fears of the main characters, we hope that whole new layers of their personality will be revealed as their nightmares are realised. But what is it that these fearless vampire killers are most afraid of? Buffy fears that she'll do badly in her exams. Xander is most concerned that he'll be humiliated by turning up for class in his boxer shorts. And Willow is petrified of performing as the world's finest soprano. Pretty mundane stuff.

Buffy's fear that she'll become one of the creatures she most hates is a nice idea, but is soon thrown away. By far the best scenes are those between Buffy and her estranged father, Hank. It may be manipulative, but it's hard not to be affected by scenes which pare away at one of the few normal relationships that Buffy has. The episode is not as dark as it might have been. It's brightened by Willow's stage appearance, which is one of the funniest scenes of the series. David Greenwalt's script provides a rugged framework, bonding together the various set-pieces, which otherwise might have seemed rather inconsequential.

4V11

As the Spring Fling dance nears, Cordelia's new boyfriend is mysteriously beaten up at school - by a baseball bat with no one attached to it. The attacker leaves a cryptic message on the locker, which leads Buffy to believe it wasn't an ordinary monster. Giles suggests it might be an invisible creature or a ghost.

Another attack finds Cordelia's friend Harmony flying backwards down a flight of stairs, with no apparent outside force. After hearing a girl's voice, Buffy pursues the invisible attacker to no avail. Buffy enlists Willow's help in trying to get a list of missing kids - perhaps this invisible girl is one of them. Meanwhile, Angel appears at the library and says he's worried about Buffy - he knows that something big is about to happen but he doesn't know what.

Shock of shocks - Cordelia is elected the May Queen for the school dance. Buffy is convinced Cordelia is the link between the two mysterious attacks. She finds a girl in Willow's printout, Marcie Ross, who she thinks might be the one. Marcie was in the band, and the invisible girl keeps hiding in the ceiling above the band room. Buffy follows her there to find a nest of sorts where the invisible girl has been hiding. Another attack occurs: Cordelia's teacher is almost suffocated.

Further investigation reveals that Marcie was in everyone's classes, but no one seems to even remember that she existed. Giles says she simply became invisible because she was perceived that way - it's all due to physics, helped along by living above a Hellmouth.

Marcie's goal seems to be to destroy Cordelia, who is already wigged out by the attacks on people close to her. Cordelia's coronation as May Queen that evening would be the perfect place for Marcie to attack, but Cordelia is none too thrilled about being used as bait. As Cordelia gets ready at school for the dance, Marcie yanks her up through the ceiling. Meanwhile, Giles, Willow and Xander hear some haunting music and try to follow it, hoping to find Marcie. The trio is led to the boiler room where they are overcome by gas fumes. Marcie anesthetizes both Buffy and Cordelia, brings them to the Bronze and ties them up. Marcie, armed with an arsenal of creepy surgical instruments, explains to Cordelia that she intends to give her a face no one will ever forget. She slices Cordelia's cheek, but Buffy manages to free herself and a scuffle ensues. Buffy finally knocks Marcie out, just as a pair of FBI agents arrive to take Marcie away. Angel saves the unconscious gang in the boiler room, but Giles tells Buffy it was a janitor - he doesn't want to remind Buffy of her lost love. Cordelia acts grateful to the gang, but becomes her normal obnoxious self when her newly-healed boyfriend and her cooler-than-thou friends show up.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

Ashley Gable and Thomas Swyden's clever script, based on a story by series creator Joss Whedon, is jam-packed with clever dialogue, which other writers would do well to use as a model. It also has a carefully-polished plot, which makes good use of the theme of alienation. That said, it's not the most original story, and it can be no coincidence that Willow is wearing a Scooby Doo T-shirt is some scenes. All the series needs is a pooch and a van, and Hanna-Barbera would be consulting their lawyers!

This episode thrusts Cordelia into the spotlight, and Charisma Carpenter proves to be more than up to the challenge. It's a pivotal episode for her character, redefining her relationship with Buffy and the gang, and mellowing her haughty attitude. After opening her heart to Buffy, Cordelia is practically one of the Slayerettes by the end of the episode, even though there is still some animosity. ("Buffy, I know we've had our differences, with you being so weird an' all, and hanging out with these total losers... I know that you share this feeling that we have for each other, deep down.", blubbers Cordelia. "Nausea?!", suggests Willow.)

It also brings a new dimension to Angel's relationship with Giles, as he retrieves the book about Slayer lore that will play such an important part in the series' finale. The explanation for Marcie's invisibility (the result of people's indifference combined with energy from the Hellmouth) is particularly inventive, and deftly bypasses the obvious potions and scientific experiments.

"By the way, I really like your dress!" - Willow, The Master, Angel...

At the Bronze, Xander rehearses asking Buffy out to the prom by trying his speech out on lovesick Willow. Meanwhile, Buffy is having a closer call than usual with her vampire attackers. Giles reads a frightening prophecy about the Master and the Slayer, and an earthquake hits Sunnydale.

Buffy tells Giles about her attack, and lets him know that she's starting to get scared. When Xander finally gets the nerve to ask her out, she turns him down, saying she doesn't think of him "that way" and doesn't want to spoil their friendship. In the library, Giles and Ms. Calendar discuss the prophecy: the earthquake, along with several strange occurrences in Sunnydale, seem to confirm that the apocalypse is near. Buffy overhears Giles telling Angel, "Tomorrow she'll face the Master and she will die." Buffy freaks out and tells Giles she wants to quit. More signs of the end appear: a roomful of students, including Cordelia's new beau, are found dead at school, totally unnerving Willow, who discovers their bodies. Buffy decides that even though she's afraid, only she can try to save the world by facing the Master. She goes out with a crossbow, and the Anointed One leads her to the Master. Meanwhile, Xander enlists Angel's help in trying to protect Buffy.

The Master bites Buffy, and she drops into a puddle. This allows him to break through to the "other side." Xander and Angel find Buffy, and Xander is able to revive her using CPR. Meanwhile, Cordelia, Willow and Ms. Calendar find themselves driving through a sea of vampires in the streets. They try to escape to the library, but the undead follow them. As they try to fight them off, a huge, horrific monster comes up through the floor and attacks them. Buffy makes it back to the school and fights the Master on the roof. She throws him through the roof window and he falls through, getting impaled on the way down. He disintegrates, and the monster and the vampires disappear with him. "We saved the world. I say we party," exclaims Buffy.

There's a dark cloud hanging over this episode which gives the proceedings a different, quite sinister tone. It brings the first season to a very satisfying conclusion even if many questions, in true cliff-hanger style, remain unanswered. The episode showcases the acting abilities of its regular cast members, and puts the characters in unusual scenes. Buffy's tense "I quit!" moment revealing Buffy at her most insecure ("Giles, I'm sixteen years old. I don't want to die."), and Xander finally plucking up the courage to ask Buffy for a date.

Prophecy Girl is a very important episode, not least because it's the one where Jenny Calendar is finally integrated into Buffy's circle of confidantes. ("How come she's in the club?", moans Willow). Paradoxically, it now seems that the team is finally complete even though the episode contains several scenes where their relationships seem to be crumbling away - Buffy rejecting Xander, Willow rejecting Xander, Buffy rejecting her father figure, Giles. As cosy preconceptions about the dynamics between the characters are shattered, the sense of disintegration is almost palpable.

Despite superficial appearances (those intentionally written into the script), there's no sign that the show itself is tiring. Indeed, the special effects in this episode are among the best the show has to offer and foreshadow even greater things to come in the second season.

After spending the summer with her dad in L.A., Buffy returns to Sunnydale, well, very unsunny. It seems her prom night massacre of the Master - during which she died and came back to life - gave her more of a wiggins than she admitted at the time. And to make matters worse, the Master is not quite as dead as everyone had hoped. His minions assemble with the Anointed One and plan to try to bring the Master back. This can be done by assembling those who were with him when he died - Willow, Cordelia, Giles, and Ms. Calendar, the computer teacher who Giles is stuck on. Angel warns Buffy about the Anointed One's powers, but she ignores him. Besides being rude to Angel and nasty to Cordelia, she is cold to Willow and Xander. She even tries to make Angel jealous by dancing seductively with poor Xander, who buys her act. Xander finally tells Buffy off when the vampires beat him up and start assembling the foursome they need for their mission. Buffy rescues Willow, Cordelia, Giles and Ms. Calendar, who are hung upside down and about to be killed. In order to finish off the Master, Buffy crushes his bones.

After this final act, Buffy is purged of her fear and anger and starts sobbing as Angel holds her. The next day at school, she apologizes to Giles for behaving so badly, and is mortified when she realizes how rotten she's been to her friends. But once she gets to class, Xander and Willow are quick to forgive her, and the Three Musketeers - or is it the Three Stooges? - are together again.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

Following the Summer break, and her dramatic encounter with The Master, Buffy returns to Sunnydale. Likewise, the show returned to American screens, looking revitalised and exhibiting a new-found confidence. 'When She Was Bad' is another excellent episode written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon. It begins by showing that the events at the end of the last series had long-lasting consequences (see @{"Prophecy Girl" LINK "PROPHECYGIRL"}). This is a style that's becoming increasingly rare in television drama, which normally tends to live in the moment and assumes that viewers are too fickle to follow plot threads across more than one episode.

The episode does a good job tying up the loose ends left at the end of the first series and toys with the viewer's expectations that The Master might not really be dead. In fact, it's Buffy that might not really be alive or, at least, not fully recovered. Before long, though, it becomes obvious that she's back to fighting fitness, and by the end of the episode, Buffy has exorcised her remaining demons. Sarah Michelle Gellar handles the changing moods of her character very skilfully, bringing added depth to confrontational scenes with Cordelia, Angel and Xander.

Cordelia is finally integrated into Buffy's club of confidantes during "When She Was Bad". This changes the dynamic relationship between the lead characters - keeping the show fresh and giving the talented Charisma Carpenter new nuances to work with.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Being the first episode of the second series, 'When She Was Bad' features a revamped title sequence, with added credit for David Boreanaz (Angel). Since the second season was shot six months after filming wrapped on the first, several cast members have different hairstyles. (In Sunnydale at least several weeks have passed since the events in @{"Prophecy Girl" LINK "PROPHECYGIRL"} so it makes sense that there would be differences).

The body of a dead cheerleader is dug up from the cemetery, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer is officially back in the saddle. Cordelia accidentally stumbles upon a bunch of body parts in a dumpster, and the parts add up to three people - the dead cheerleader and her two friends who were killed in the same car accident - only some of the parts are missing.

Giles suspects zombie activity, and clues lead to Chris - a science whiz who's been quiet and withdrawn since his brother Daryl's death. We discover Chris, with his buddy Eric, has been secretly assembling a woman from these body parts for Daryl, so he won't have to be alone through eternity. The only part they don't have yet is a head - the cheerleader's heads are unusable because the formaldehyde used to preserve dead bodies causes rapid deterioration of brain cells. There are currently three live head donors being considered: Buffy, Willow and Cordelia. Daryl votes for Cordelia, but Chris doesn't want to kill anyone, and Daryl becomes enraged. Meanwhile, Giles is courting Ms. Calendar, and their first official date is to the school's football game. That night, Eric decides to kill Cordelia, since Chris can't bring himself to do the deed, but Buffy arrives just in time to save her. As Buffy struggles with Daryl, a can of gasoline spills. A fire starts and Xander, who has arrived to help, pushes Cordelia to safety. Chris###todo-check, seeing his headless fiancee is about to perish in the fire, throws himself on top of her and pledges his undying love. Angel and Buffy finally talk things out - he admits he was jealous of her attention to Xander, and he feels left out of her life since he can only be with her at night. They walk off together as we see Daryl's tombstone.

Adding a typically Buffy-esque twist to a well-worn theme, (previously explored in John Hughes' 1985 teen flick 'Weird Science', itself a reworking of mes Whale's 1935 masterpiece 'Bride of Frankenstein'), makes 'Some Assembly Required' a very entertaining episode. Ty King's witty script contains lots of gleefully black humour, and even manages to generate some sympathy for its most villainous characters.

The episode is also kept buoyant by the charming scenes between the flirtatious Jenny Calendar and the stuffy Giles, who finally plucks up the courage to ask her out. This is the culmination of a lot of very funny advice that Giles receives from his students.

In the tradition of the great Universal Studios horror films of the 1930s 'Some Assembly Required' ends with a laboratory fire started during a struggle between the heroes and the villains, (who are, of course, engulfed in the inferno!).

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

From this episode onwards the short narration that opens each episode is now spoken by Anthony Stewart Head (Giles), and it now has a different underscore. This episode is the first to reveal Miss Calendar's first name: Jenny.

5V03

The leaves are changing color, the air is cooler, it must be time for... the Night of St. Vigius. Once again Buffy's life is in danger as the Master's minions seek to gain extra power by killing Buffy during a sacred holiday. But Buffy's mind is not on slaying. She and Sheila, a perpetually bad student, have been threatened with expulsion by Principal Snyder. The only chance they have of staying in school is to help organize Parent Teacher Night.

While Buffy plans this evening, a new demon is in town - Spike, a 200-year-old vampire who has actually killed two slayers over the past century. Giles urges Buffy to take this challenge seriously, but she is preoccupied with her school project and trying to cover for the never-present Sheila.

When Parent Teacher Night arrives, Buffy unsuccessfully tries to keep her mother away from Principal Snyder. But things become a bit more serious when Spike and some other vampires crash the event. The faculty, and Buffy's mom, think these are just some gang kids on angel dust. Buffy convinces her mother to stay hidden while she faces the vampires. Giles tries to help Buffy, whose biggest worry is about her mother's safety. No- show Sheila finally arrives and - surprise! - she's a vampire too. Angel tries to help by pretending he's on Spike's side and offering up Xander's neck for a snack. Spike isn't fooled and becomes enraged. Buffy continues to battle Spike until her mom's maternal instincts overtake her fear and she whacks Spike with an axe. Spike flees. Much to Buffy's relief, Mom is not angry about Principal Snyder's assessment - she's proud that Buffy is so resourceful and thoughtful of others in a crisis.

When Spike returns to the lair without having killed Buffy, the Anointed One is angry. Spike throws the child into a cage and raises it up to the light. Suddenly the cage is empty and we see only a puff of smoke, as Spike and his main squeeze Drusilla go off to watch TV.

Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt's action-packed script, which takes it's title from the classic Bruce Willis movie 'Die Hard', is primarily concerned with introducing the two new main characters, and with establishing them as worthy opponents for the Slayer. The comedy elements, most notably Buffy's efforts to keep her mother and Principal Snyder apart, fall a little flat, but the wealth of rich character-driven scenes more than compensates.

There is growing friction between Xander and Angel, who have a number of memorable scenes together. We are also reminded how easily Angel is able to switch to the dark side.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

In this episode we discover that Principal Snyder and the authorities may know a lot more about the Hellmouth and the supernatural forces gathering there than was previously realised.

We also find out the first names of two regular characters: Joyce Summers (Buffy's mother), and Principal Bob Snyder.

5V04

Sunnydale High is boasting a new cultural exchange program - students from other countries being hosted by local families, and a celebration of culture's dance is being plan. Everything is swell until Xander finds out that Buffy's student is a guy. At a school museum trip, a 500-year-old mummy, holding a cursed seal which serves as a warning to any who wake her, is on exhibit. When everyone leaves, dimwitted student Rodney tries to take the seal. It breaks, and the mummy arises, grabs him, kisses him and mummifies him. When Rodney turns up missing, Buffy, Giles, Xander and Willow go to the museum to look for clues and find him mummified, and a man with a knife jumps out at them. Giles tries to decipher what's left of the seal, but they are ancient pictograms.

Buffy's exchange student arrives at the bus station, only to meet the same fate as Rodney. From this latest kiss, the 500-year-old mummy transforms into Ampatta, a beautiful Peruvian teenage girl who pretends to be the exchange student. Xander goes gaga over her and Giles asks her to help him decipher the seal. She says the picture of a man with a knife represents a bodyguard. As Xander hangs out with Ampatta, the knife guy shows up again, looking for the rest of the seal. Ampatta, shaken, tells Giles to destroy it, but Giles wants to go back to the museum to find the missing parts. Knife guy returns in the ladies' room, and Ampatta finally kisses and mummifies him, too. Xander takes Ampatta to the school dance, and Buffy discovers the real exchange student's mummified corpse in her trunk. She and Giles realize Ampatta's the mummy. It seems she was in a similar situation to Buffy's - she was chosen to defend her people, and was killed at 16. Meanwhile, things are getting hot and heavy at the dance with Xander and Ampatta, but she is starting to turn back into a mummy. She must kiss someone quickly or it will be too late. She runs away from Xander and goes to the museum to try to break the seal that Giles is about to restore.

Buffy saves Giles before Ampatta kisses him, but gets thrown into the tomb. When Willow tries to help, Xander intervenes and offers his own life instead. Buffy escapes from the tomb just in time to pull the now-mummified Ampatta off of Xander, and the poor guy's dance partner breaks into pieces.

There seem to be a few too many elements in 'Inca Mummy Girl', which uses the 'Buffy' setting to breath fresh life into a very tired stock theme. The story is overcomplicated, and might have been better focused if one entire thread had been eliminated (perhaps the whole sub-plot involving Ampatta's bodyguard?). This episode is a good example of how throwing a disruptive element into the mix can generate some friction between the regular characters without doing any long-term damage. In this case Ampatta's arrival causes each of the main characters to reassess their relationships with each other (particularly the tentative one between Willow and Xander). Matt Keine and Joe Reinkemeyer's witty script contains a lot of sharp dialogue which acknowledges that the audience is usually a couple of steps ahead of Buffy and the gang.

5V05

A young woman is chased to a cemetery by a bunch of men wearing monk's robes. But Buffy and her merry band are unaware of this, and are delighted about the recent lull of activity on the Hellmouth. Giles frets about this, telling Buffy she shouldn't get lax about her training, but Buffy is ready to let her hair down a little. Meanwhile, Cordelia is dating a fraternity man, Richard - intrigued mostly by his wealth and society connections. When smarmy Richard comes to pick her up at school, his sweet frat brother, Tom, charms Buffy. But Buffy doesn't want to go to their frat party. As far as she's concerned, she's "seeing" Angel - if only in the dark. When Buffy tries to get Angel to go out with her, he says their difference in age is a problem, as well as the fact that his demon side tends to take over when he becomes passionate. Dejected, she decides to join Cordelia at the frat party, which requires lying to ever-vigilant Giles about her evening's activities. Buffy and Cordelia are both drugged at the party and chained in the basement with the young woman from the cemetery. Back at school, a broken, bloody bracelet Buffy found at the cemetery is traced by Willow and Giles to the woman who had been chased.

Willow's hacking skills lead to more info - a year earlier to the day, three other women disappeared and were never found. They go to the frat party with Angel and Xander just as the three women are about to be offered up as a sacrifice to Machida, a snake-like demon who arises every year and is worshipped by the frat boys. Buffy manages to break loose and a scuffle ensues. Tom, who turns out to be way wicked, is about to cut Buffy's throat, but she grabs the sword and defeats Machida. Cordelia, messy but undaunted, chides Tom as he is led away with a typically pithy remark: "You're going to jail for fifteen thousand years!" Giles forgives Buffy for her lie, and Angel shows up at the Bronze and asks Buffy out for coffee. She grins and takes a rain check, as any self-respecting slayer would, and all is well again at the unpredictable Hellmouth.

Let's face it: there's always something nasty in the cellar. If it isn't Beryl Reid and Flora Robson's deformed brother ('The Beast In The Cellar', 1971) or a clergyman's cannibal son ('The Ghoul', 1974), it must be a fraternity's reptile god! Writer David Greenwalt's script adds some new twists to a well-worn theme, but it proved to be a bit too ambitious for Greenwalt the director. He made some changes to the end of the story, reducing Machida's interaction with the frat boys and keeping the creature lurking in the shadows. Because of this it's not made apparent until the last moments of the episode that Machida has been supporting the college for decades - an interesting idea which isn't given any time to develop.

British viewers are likely to feel a little alienated by the fraternity system so beloved by American colleges and American filmmakers. It's all rather baffling, and perhaps prevents a fair evaluation. However, it's evident that 'Reptile Boy' is a scrappy and uneven episode which never quite strikes the right balance between the light and dark elements of the plot. Fans might derive some pleasure from seeing Xander dressed as a woman, or Buffy dancing, but the episode never maintains a consistent tone.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

The actor playing Machida, Robin Atkin Downes, is perhaps better known for his regular role as the telepath Byron on 'Babylon 5'.

The leader of the fraternity, Richard, is played by Greg Vaughan, who also played Charisma Carpenter's boyfriend in the short-lived Aaron Spelling drama series 'Malibu Shores'.

"Buffy, you may be hot stuff when it comes to demonology or whatever, but when it comes to dating, I'm the slayer!" - Cordelia

It's time for Buffy and Angel's first actual date and she's late - she's been off slaying, while, unbeknownst to her, an undead bystander has videotaped her actions for Spike to study. But other matters need attending to - Buffy, Willow and Xander have been shanghaied into being trick-or-treat chaperones for Halloween. Buffy's disappointed, as this is the one night she has heard on which the undead like to chill, and she was looking forward to doing nothing. Buffy and Willow realize they know very little about Angel's personal life, and decide to steal Giles' watcher journals. They stumble upon a picture of a beautiful noblewoman from 1775 - when Angel was 18 - and Buffy feels extremely inadequate. While costume shopping, Buffy finds a dress just like the one the noblewoman wore. Xander decides to wear army fatigues, and Willow goes for a cheesy ghost costume. Meanwhile, Spike is off watching the video of Buffy and his girlfriend Drusilla predicts Buffy will become weak on Halloween from some new outside force - the costume salesman, who we see chanting to a statue by candlelight.

On Halloween, Willow dresses like a hoochie mama. Buffy is delighted, but Willow chickens out and is a ghost once again. While Buffy the noblewoman, Willow the ghost, and Xander the soldier are out with their little trick-or-treaters, things start changing, thanks to our chanting costumer, and the three become the characters they were pretending to be. Now that Buffy is no longer the slayer, Spike goes to kill Buffy. Giles figures out that the costume shop is somehow involved, and discovers the chanter - who is actually an old friend, Ethan. Ethan threatens to reveal secrets about Giles to Sunnydale, but Giles decks him and demands to know how to break the spell. As Giles shatters the statue, as instructed by Ethan, Spike is just about to kill Buffy. In the nick of time, she returns to being Buffy the Vampire Slayer and pummels Spike, who runs off. Once they're finally alone, Buffy tells Angel she dressed like that to please him, but he admits he hated those noblewomen - he wanted someone exciting and interesting. They make out at last - who said the undead don't like to have fun on Halloween? The next day, Giles returns to Ethan's store, which is bare except for a note which says, "Be seeing you."

@{b}More Information@{ub}

It's odd that the American tradition of Trick or Treating, which seems so much fun, hasn't been more heartily embraced this side of the Atlantic. 'Halloween' provides a backdrop rich in potential. Carl Ellsworth's clever script takes full advantage of the situation, and even makes time to expand our knowledge about Angel and, especially, Giles. There are one or two underdeveloped elements: Spike and Drusilla's appearance is rather perfunctory, for example, and shifts the focus away from the episode's villain du jour, Ethan.

It's obvious that everyone had a lot of fun making this episode. The script gives all the main actors a chance to expand their range a little, even if they have to do it dressed in silly costumes. Although Alyson Hannigan puts up some stiff competition, Sarah Michelle Gellar steals the show as the prim and proper 1775 noblewoman: "I was brought up a proper lady. I wasn't meant to understand things. I'm just meant to look pretty, and then someone nice will marry me, possibly a Baron!"

There's a wonderful dark side to 'Halloween' which seems to underpin all the best episodes. Scenes of the children morphing into monsters and demons are great fun, but it's the scenes between Ethan Rayne and "Ripper" that are the most intriguing. They open up new avenues of potential which are sadly only touched upon in subsequent episodes.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

According to the book in Giles' library, Angel was eighteen in 1775, and still human. British actor Robin Sachs appeared as Heinrich in the 1971 Hammer movie "Vampire Circus". He's also featured in "Jurassic Park - The Lost World" and a couple of episodes of "Babylon 5".

At the cemetery, Buffy spies Angel talking to a strange girl - who we recognize as Drusilla, the evil Spike's spaced-out paramour. The next day at school, Buffy runs into an old friend, Billy Fordham. "Ford" has transferred to Sunnydale from their old school (from which Buffy was suspended). Later at the Bronze, Ford admits that he knows she's the slayer. We see him enter a building which is crawling with ghoulish people and find out he is plotting something with them.

Angel, who's gotten a bad vibe from Ford, enlists Willow's help in investigating the kid on the Internet. Meanwhile, Buffy and Ford encounter some vampires on school grounds, and as she runs off to slay one, Ford tells a girl vampire he'll spare her if she'll give him information. When Buffy returns, he pretends that he killed the girl. Even though Willow doesn't find any incriminating evidence against Ford, Angel's still sure he's bad news, and he, Willow and Xander go to Ford's hangout. It seems all these creepy kids are not really undead, but just vampire wannabes. Concerned that the vampires have come to Sunnydale High, Buffy beeps Giles, who's out on a date with Miss Calendar. They all meet at the library, and Buffy spots a picture of Drusilla in Giles' book. Suddenly, a girl vampire runs in, grabs the book and flees - the vampire Ford said he killed. Back at Spike's lair, Ford enters and offers His Evilness a deal - if he'll turn Ford into a vampire, Ford will give him Buffy.

Angel finally warns Buffy about Ford. When she confronts him about Dru, he reluctantly reveals that he was responsible for her death - he had been obsessed with her, and he tortured and killed her. Buffy finally trusts Angel, and agrees to go out with Ford to set him up. When she goes to his hangout he and his friends lock her in. She tries to explain to them that becoming a vampire doesn't mean living eternally, but Ford takes her aside and confides that he has only 6 months to live, and this is the best alternative to death he can find.

At sunset, Spike, Dru and company bust in and start ravaging the group. Buffy grabs Dru and tells Spike she'll kill his girl unless everyone is released. The wannabes are released and Buffy escapes, but leaves Ford inside to the death he prayed for.

As Buffy and Giles chat at the cemetery, Ford pops out of his grave and she slays him as if swatting a fly and goes back to her conversation.

Another episode with sinister overtones from series creator Joss Whedon, who seems incapable of writing a bad story. This episode demonstrates two of his greatest strengths as a writer: the ability to create interesting and memorable characters very economically (here, for example, there's the foppish Diego - formerly Marvin! - and the fawning Chantarelle, whose wish to join "the lonely ones" is totally believable); and his seemingly effortless skill at creating snappy dialogue.

There are countless examples of this throughout the episode, and barely a line is wasted. Whedon makes it seem like other writers finish their scripts before adding in the wisecracks and teen-talk. His dialogue rarely seems contrived or out of place, and brings real personality to his characters.

There's a terrific piece of dialogue at the end of the episode which smartly captures the tone of this episode. Giles is consoling Buffy after she was forced to stake Billy: "It's terribly simple. The good guys are always stalwart and true. The bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats. We always defeat them and save the day. No-one ever dies, and everybody lives happily ever after." Buffy's response is swift and tinged with bitterness: "Liar!"

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Make-up supervisor Todd McIntosh appears as the vampire who Giles, Willow and Xander meet on their way to the Sunset Club.

The film that Billy Fordham mimes along to is the 1973 TV movie version of 'Dracula', directed by the creator of long-running vampire-themed soap opera 'Dark Shadows', Dan Curtis. The Count was played by Jack Palance.

Giles reveals that Drusilla was killed by an angry mob in Prague, and was thought to be dead. Angel admits that of all the evil things he's done since becoming a vampire, Drusilla was "the worst": "I made her insane; killed everyone she loved, visited every mental torture on her I could devise."

5V08

A man tries to get into the library to see Giles but is killed by a female demon. After killing him, she turns into a puddle of green goo. At school, Giles tells Buffy to meet him later at the hospital for a blood delivery, which attracts vampires. Back at the library, a detective is waiting for Giles - the dead man had Giles' address on him. Giles identifies the body as an old friend from London. The body has a tattoo on it, which Giles says he can't identify.

Shaken, Giles doesn't meet Buffy at the hospital, and she battles the vampires alone until Angel shows up. When Buffy goes to Giles' house to see what happened, he's dishevelled and sends her away. He calls another friend in London and finds out that she's dead, too. As he rolls up his sleeves, we see he has the same tattoo as his friend. Meanwhile, the dead friend, Phillip, comes back to life in the morgue, his eyes flashing, and escapes. Saturday, Willow, Xander, and Cordelia meet with Jenny Calendar - Giles' girlfriend - for a computer class. Buffy shows up to express her concern about Giles' behavior.

Cordelia mentions the police visit to the library, which slipped her Cordelia-centered mind. In the library, Buffy finds Ethan, the costume shop owner and Giles old friend who tried to kill her on @{"Halloween" LINK "HALLOWEEN"}. As she calls Giles, Ethan mentions the "Mark of Eyghon." Giles says she's in danger, and the dead Phillip enters. A panicked Giles shows up and, after a scuffle which leaves Jenny unconscious, Phillip turns into the green goo. Some of it gets on Jenny and when she comes to, she seems normal but we see her eyes flash. Research freak Willow discovers the "Mark of Eyghon" in a book: Eyghon possesses the body of a dead or unconscious host. They figure out that he's jumped from Phillip's body to Jenny's.

Possessed Jenny, looking and sounding like a demon, tries to seduce Giles. When Buffy comes to the rescue, Jenny jumps out the window. Giles explains to Buffy that he ran with a bad crowd when he was young, and they used Eyghon as a temporary high - directing him in and out of each others' bodies. But one friend died, then later the girl who killed Phillip, and now it seems the rest of the group will die, too. Buffy goes to the deserted costume shop to try to help Ethan but he knocks her out, ties her up and tattoos her. He pours acid on his own tattoo so that Eyghon will take Buffy instead of him. Jenny enters, a full-tilt demon, and Buffy breaks free. Angel enters suddenly and chokes Jenny: the spirit leaves her body and enters Angel's, since he's really dead (Willow's plan: you go, girl!) It passes through Angel, and Jenny's back to normal, but Ethan escapes.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

We discover a little more about Giles' murky past in this episode, but it soon becomes clear that it's not quite as ominous as @{"Lie To Me" LINK "LIETOME"} perhaps suggested, and, by the end of the episode, it seems that there's little more to be mined from this particular seam. There's some compensation to be found in the palpable chemistry developing between Giles and Miss Calendar, and she is given a lot more to do, including some fun scenes when she is in her "weakened state".

The return of @{"Halloween's" LINK "HALLOWEEN"} Ethan Rayne is no surprise, but it seems unfortunate that the producers seemed in such a hurry to bring him back. This episode is so muddled that it is unable to focus on the character, and what potential there was in having him return is lost.

The tension between Giles and Buffy is nicely played, culminating in the scene where Giles selflessly offers to take Buffy's place as Eyghon's next host. 'The Dark Age' is an important episode, especially for Giles and Jenny. It draws Cordelia and Jenny closer to Buffy and her work as the Slayer, and leaves all the characters changed to some degree or other.

"Something's coming Buffy, and whatever it is, I can guarantee it's not good." - Giles

It's Career Week at Sunnydale High for everyone but Buffy - her fate as the Slayer has already been sealed. While Buffy is bummed, Spike seeks out a cure for Drusilla by having a transcriber go through a book stolen from Giles. They realize the book is in code, and through tarot cards, they can figure out what to do. While at the cemetery, Buffy enters a mausoleum and sees the transcriber and another vampire - she's able to kill the vampire, but the transcriber eludes her. When she returns home, Angel is waiting for her and warns her of trouble. She's still upset about Career Day, and reveals her secret childhood obsession with ice skater Dorothy Hamill.

Giles worries about the missing vampire and what was taken from the mausoleum. We see Spike with a coffin pillow adorned with a cross - part of the cure. He knows if Buffy keeps interrupting, he'll never get the key to curing Drusilla, so he decides to summon bounty hunters - the most savage of killers. Giles chastises Buffy as they examine the mausoleum together and Giles finds the name "duLac" - he was the author of the stolen book Spike has; a book of evil spells written in archaic Latin. They realize the cross has been stolen from his crypt, and it is the tool which will allow Spike to wreak havoc - Giles says he must decipher the book first in order to save them. Meanwhile, we strangers start hitting town and doing their damage - one is a door-to-door cosmetic salesman, one is an evil-looking guy, and one is a beautiful woman.

Buffy blows off the deciphering session to go skate with Angel, but Evil Guy is already there. Angel tries to save her but she's able to cut the guy's throat with her skate blade. Angel wigs when he sees the guy's ring - Giles identifies it as the symbol of the Order of Teraka - the deadly assassins. These are not the ordinary vamps; they'll stop at nothing to kill everything in their paths. Buffy freaks and goes to Angel's house while Angel goes to a local bar, trolling for information about the bounty hunters. The beautiful woman arrives and attacks Angel, locking him in a cage where he'll be vulnerable to deadly sunlight within hours. While working with the transcriber, Spike has finally found the answer to curing Drusilla. As Xander and Cordelia go looking for Buffy at her house, Cordelia lets the cosmetics salesman in. Back at Angel's house, the beautiful woman tries to kill Buffy with an axe, identifying herself as Kendra, the Vampire Slayer... @{"[to be continued...]" LINK "WHATSMYLINE2"}

Noxon and Gordon use the two-episode format to unravel their tale at a leisurely pace, allowing this episode to gradually build up to the intriguing cliffhanger. It also affords them the opportunity for some very nice character development.

Drusilla - if you'll forgive an inappropriate metaphor - really comes to life this episode, adding a cruel streak that nicely counterpoints the series' occasional drift into syrupy Mills and Boon-style romance, (this episode's scenes at the deserted ice rink, for example). Spike's dedication to finding a cure for Drusilla is rather touching and endearing, a good indicator that the characters have become well established. The career fair theme is used to nicely focus the episode's wider discussion of fate and destiny. There are some nice parallels between Drusilla's tarot interpretations and the career fair's prediction that Buffy - seemingly doomed to a career in law enforcement - and Xander have bleak futures ahead of them. Buffy, however, is doubtful that she will ever have a career other than being the Slayer, a nicely played scene that reminds viewers of Buffy's unhappiness: "A whole week of "What's My Line?" only I don't get to play."

If you're wondering where you've seen Kelly Connell (who plays insect monster Norman Pfister) before, it might have been in the cult TV series 'Picket Fences', where he played Chief Pathologist Carter Pike, M.E.

This episode introduces three recurring characters: Dalton, the scholarly vampire employed by Spike to translate ancient texts, Kendra, the "other" vampire slayer, and Willie, the "sleazoid" bartender at the as-yet unnamed Alibi Room. The episode's most bizarre moment occurs when Willow is woken up, muttering "Don't warn the tadpoles " Her fear of things amphibian is later revisited in 'Killed By Death'.

Oz and Willow are introduced to each other in this episode, when they're both chosen as candidates for careers with "the world's leading software concern". The one-eyed assassin doesn't get an on-screen name, but in the episode's official synopses he's called Octarus.

@{b}What's My Line - Part Two@{ub}
5V10

Follows on from @{"What's My Line - Part One" LINK "WHATSMYLINE1"}.

Buffy freaks as Kendra identifies herself as the Slayer. They realize that Kendra was summoned as the new Slayer when Buffy died - temporarily drowned, that is. Kendra, too, knows that evil is coming. Near death at daybreak, Angel is dragged from the cell by the guy from the bar - he dumps him in a sewer and turns him over to Spike and Drusilla. When the new moon comes that night, they will perform the ritual they figured out from the transcriber and Angel will die.

Giles seems to be bonding with Kendra, making Buffy feel left out. Now that there's a spare slayer, Buffy considers giving up the business. At Buffy's house, Cordelia chats merrily with the cosmetics guy until she realizes he has bugs crawling all over him. He turns into a huge pile of them, sending Cordelia and Xander into hiding, and they fight over what to do. In the heat of the argument, they kiss passionately (?!). They manage to escape and speed off in Cordy's car. At Sunnydale High, Willow chats with Oz, her male computer nerd counterpart, about their similar Career Fair paths. A police woman supervising the fair suddenly opens fire on Buffy and accidentally shoots Oz, but Kendra comes to Buffy's rescue. When the gang assembles in the library, Giles announces he's figured out the ritual: Angel will die that night. Buffy and Kendra go to the bar to try to get help finding Angel, but Kendra bails, convinced that Angel is evil. Meanwhile, Drusilla is having a field day with her ex-tormentor Angel, dousing him with holy water and watching him writhe in pain. The Bar Guy leads Buffy to the church, which is filled with evil Tenaka bounty hunters. Buffy watches in horror as Drusilla holds onto the tied-up Angel, sapping his power. As the policewoman assassin goes to shoot Buffy, Kendra enters to save her. Willow, Xander, Cordelia and Giles burst in and help, too. Xander and Cordelia wait for Bug Guy to, well, bug out, then they pour glue all over him and stomp on the helpless creatures. Buffy releases Angel, but Spike sets the room on fire and grabs Dru. Before they're able to escape, Buffy hurls something at them and sends them crashing into a huge organ, squooshing them both. The charm-free Kendra leaves town, and Buffy is the Number One Slayer once again. But all is not well. Emerging from the rubble in the church is Drusilla, now fully vamped out and strong enough to carry the injured Spike to safety. She's back, and she's bad.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

The arrival of Kendra is something of a distraction, and temporarily collapses the momentum of the story. It also serves to punish inattentive viewers, who wouldn't remember that, since Kendra is not one of the three assassins, there was still one assassin unaccounted for! There's a palpable feel of déjà vu about the basic plot outline (the vampires summon help to destroy the Slayer, who is interfering in their plans for world domination). It's becoming a recognisable formula for too many episodes. With the luxury of two episodes at their disposal, Gordon and Noxon should perhaps have delivered something rather more ambitious and substantial.

There are two plot ideas that are particularly rewarding. The contrast between Kendra and Buffy, who have radically different approaches to their role as Slayer, is nicely realised, especially when Buffy has to admit to and justify her relationship with Angel. The differences between Buffy and Kendra serve, too, to more closely define Buffy's ethics and methods. They also provide some clues about how Giles and Buffy's relationship might have developed under different circumstances.

Also notable is the odd ménage a trois evident between Spike, Drusilla and Angel. Her vindictive torturing of Angel reveals a lot of back-story, and perfectly sets up the episode's coda, where Drusilla rises from the wreckage of the showdown with the Slayers, her strength - if not her sanity - restored.

Xander and Cordelia's blossoming relationship is a welcome addition, correcting an imbalance in the Scooby gang's group dynamic created when Buffy crushed Xander's hopes that their friendship would lead to a more adult relationship (in @{"Prophecy Girl" LINK "PROPHECYGIRL"}).

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Buffy warns Kendra not to watch the in-flight movie if it's got Chevy Chase in it, perhaps a sly reference to the 1988 film 'Funny Farm', which featured Sarah Michelle Gellar in a tiny role as a student.

Willow and Giles both kill vampires for the first time in this episode. (Xander accidentally killed his friend, Jesse, who had become a vampire, in @{"Welcome To The Hellmouth" LINK "WELCOMETOHELLMOUTH"}).

The third assassin, the Policewoman at the career fair, is named Patrice.

5V11

"Beg to differ, little lady!" - Ted

Buffy's mom Joyce's new beau, Ted seems too good to be true. He cooks and he's a computer specialist - making him an instant hit with both Xander and Willow. At school, Giles awkwardly chats with Jenny Calendar, but she says his concern about her well-being (since she's recovered from being a demon) is getting on her nerves. Ted continues to charm the gang, until he talks to Buffy alone at the mini-golf course and reveals a decidedly dark side. Buffy puts on her Angela Lansbury hat and checks out Ted's place of business. She finds out from a co-worker that he's engaged. She asks Joyce and Ted at dinner if this is true, and Ted denies it - but he's certainly hoping to ask Joyce to marry him if all goes well. Buffy leaves and returns through her window as usual, only to find Ted snooping through her things. He sees her slayer journal, and threatens to show it to Joyce if Buffy doesn't toe the line. She talks back to him, and he pummels her. A fight ensues and one of her blows knocks him down the steps - killing him.

Buffy goes to school in a daze - she's never killed someone who wasn't already undead. Knowing Buffy wouldn't have tangled with someone just because he was dating her mom, Xander, Willow and Cordelia try to figure out what Ted was up to. Xander's extremely concerned, but suddenly says, "Don't sweat it." This is a big, honking clue to Willow, and she realizes what's caused Xander's change of attitude - he's eating one of Ted's homebaked cookies. Analysis shows the cookies contain a tranquilizer. Then Cordelia investigates further and finds out Ted has had four wives. Meanwhile, at the cemetery, Jenny apologizes to Giles for being short with him, but their warm fuzzy moment is interrupted by a vampire who attacks Giles. Jenny tries to shoot the demon with Giles' crossbow, but hits Giles by accident. Giles removes the bow and kills the demon. Buffy discovers the dead Ted in her room, looking remarkably healthy. She stabs him with a nail file and discovers he's a robot. Xander, Willow and Cordelia continue their sleuthing and stumble upon what's left of Ted's ex-wives in his closet. Back at the Buffy's, Ted approaches Joyce, who is freaked to see him, then glad to see him, then completely wigged when he starts short-circuiting and revealing his intent to dominate her. Buffy whacks him with a frying pan, exposing his robot face and killing him (although on this show you never know...). At school, it's just another ordinary post-slaying day at Sunnydale, until the gang discover Giles and Jenny making out.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

'Ted' taps into some dark territory, and explores the feelings of alienation and betrayal experienced by many children whose divorced parents start dating someone new. Or, as Buffy more succinctly puts it: "Seeing my mother Frenching a guy is definitely a ticket to Therapyland!" Buffy's dislike and distrust of Ted runs counter to her friends' experience of him, which effectively isolates her from them, too, so it's hardly surprising that she runs straight to Angel when she needs a sympathetic ear! There are plenty of sly hints about Ted's true identity in Greenwalt and Whedon's fully developed script, an uncomplicated mystery story - albeit one with the usual 'Buffy' slant - packed with events that conjure interesting emotional responses from the main characters. As well as Buffy struggling to come to terms with her Mother's new partner and her role as "the dutiful daughter", we have Giles rebuilding his fragile relationship with Jenny, following her possession in @{"The Dark Age" LINK "THEDARKAGE"}.

Ted's apparent death is an excellent plot twist, and for a while it seems that Buffy's judgement is highly questionable. Joyce's reaction, and the subsequent police investigation, which raises some serious real-world issues about domestic abuse, both provide rich dramatic potential that the writers are able to casually discard without detriment to their robust story.

'Three's Company' star John Ritter seems strangely miscast as Ted, and oddly out of sync with the series' established tone. It's a role that requires the range to convey rapid mood swings and subtle nuances, and would have proved a challenge for even the most experienced actor.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Pop culture: the conversation about The Captain and Tennille refers to a famous pop duo whose career began as backing singers for the Beach Boys. In 1975 their Neil Sedaka-penned song "Love Will Keep Us Together" became their first hit as a duo, selling more than a million copies. Their singing career flourished for nearly five years before they moved into television, where they had their own series.

Pop culture #2: The "Stepford" mention refers to 'The Stepford Wives', the story about a town in Connecticut where all the women, who lead lives of blissful domesticity, turn out to be robots. Ira Levin's novel was turned into a film in 1975, starring Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss, which spawned two awful TV movie sequels.

5V12

"Please! Like Angel and I are endless slaves to passion! Grow up!" - Buffy

Buffy runs into a cowboy vampire at the mall, then returns to her mom Joyce, who is becoming increasingly annoyed about her daughter's lack of responsibility. The next day at school in health class, the students are asked to take care of an egg as if it were a baby, to teach them how much responsibility it takes to be a parent. Giles warns Buffy about the vamp she ran into - Lyle and his brother Tector, the Gorches, are cowboy vampires, but he's not sure why they've been drawn to Sunnydale at this time. But Buffy's head is not into slaying or egg-raising these days - she's ever more into the dreamy Angel, and her nights at the cemetery have become nothing more than make-out sessions with her undead man. When Buffy returns from her non-productive investigation of the Gorches, she finds her egg baby shaking - she's wigged. A gross scorpion-like slimy creature bursts from it and attacks her, but she manages to stab it to death with a pair of scissors. She calls Willow to let her know what's happened, but Willow says her own egg baby is fine, and there's nothing to worry about. But we see that Willow is lying, because her own egg is indeed broken apart, and she has a spaced-out look on her face. When Joyce enters Buffy's room and finds her fully dressed, she thinks she's getting ready to sneak out and grounds her.

The next day at school, Willow gathers the gang for a monster autopsy. But she and Cordelia, whose egg has also spawned a creature, wind up decking Buffy and Xander and dragging them into a broom closet. Then, Willow, Cordy and a bunch of other students and teachers head zombie-like to the basement with shovels and axes. Even Joyce gets possessed, when she comes to school to fetch her grounded daughter and instead finds a spaced-out Giles, who throws one of the creatures onto her.

When Buffy and Xander come to, they find Giles' book which explains what's going on. There is a creature in the basement called a Bezoar, whose offspring attach themselves to human hosts and take control of their motor functions. They follow a possessed student, Jonathan, to the basement and discover Willow, Cordy, Giles, Joyce, and a bunch of others harvesting eggs from a gigantic slimy parasite. As Buffy looks for a weapon big enough to toast this mama Bezoar, the Gorch brothers show up. Tector approaches the Bezoar, and his brother Lyle can only look on in horror as it drags him down into the pit. An angry Lyle pushes Buffy over to the monster, whose tentacles drag her under too. The possessed humans stop working and gather round the Bezoar as Buffy battles it in the pit. We see the Bezoar's eye close and suddenly all the babies fall off of their human hosts, who then fall to the ground.

Somehow Buffy emerges victorious and Lyle gets his coat. Giles stumbles for an explanation for what's happened to everyone, and tells the student body there's been a gas leak. Once Joyce gets her bearing, Buffy is more grounded than ever. She's not allowed to leave her room, but that doesn't stop her from making out with Angel, who she kisses from her window as he is perched outside.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

This tepid 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' rip-off is one of the weakest episodes of the series, with many scenes that seem almost entirely superfluous, and others whose importance is undermined by their brevity. The sub-plot about the two vampire brothers, Lyle and Tector Gorch, initially seems promising, but soon fizzles out, playing second fiddle to the story about the egg creatures. The scene at the beginning of the episode, where Joyce chides Buffy for forgetting her dress, is amusing, and gives Buffy the chance to tell her mother that she's distracted by "saving the world from vampires".

Another funny scene is the first teenage health class, where Xander and Cordelia score points from each other, at the same time revealing a little more about their relationships than perhaps we needed to know! Generally, though, this is an episode short on laughs. The Gorches might have provided some light relief, but their comedic potential is barely developed in Marti Noxon's script.

Anyone wanting to check out this episode's antecedents is advised to read Jack Finney's 1940s novel 'The Body Snatchers', (or see any of the three movie versions adapted from it), and Robert A. Heinlein's hugely influential 1950 novel 'The Puppet Masters', (turned into a movie in 1994 after being plundered for its ideas for decades). If you enjoyed the tense scene where Buffy's egg hatches and the creature attacks her, seek out James Cameron's 1986 movie 'Aliens', which contains a very similar sequence.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Fox's official episode synopsis contains a number of minor differences: Buffy uses a letter-opener to stab the egg creature, not scissors (They look like scissors to me - Ed); Buffy is bumped into the Bezoar pit by Lyle; Tector is knocked in too.

@{b}Surprise@{ub}
5V13

Buffy's nightmare about Drusilla killing Angel gives her a major wiggins. She tells Angel about it, afraid that Drusilla might still be alive, but he thinks there's nothing to worry about. They kiss a lot. That morning at school, Buffy is all swoony about Angel, and Willow encourages her to move their relationship to the next level. Willow works up the nerve to talk to Oz, the guitar-playing cybernerd who's been mooning over her, and he asks her out for the following night - where he'll be her date for Buffy's surprise 17th birthday bash. When Buffy tells Giles and Jenny Calendar about her dream, Giles says it's possible that Drusilla is alive, and to be on alert. Sure enough, we see Spike and Dru at the factory. Spike is scarred and in a wheelchair but as evil as ever. Dru is planning a party, too, but it's a safe bet there'll be no chips and dip at this one.

A strange man approaches Jenny in class - it is her uncle, and we discover she is actually a gypsy whose entire family was killed by Angel when he was the superevil Angelus. The uncle says it's not fair for Angel to have any happiness, so it's Jenny's duty to keep Buffy away from him. Jenny offers to take Buffy to meet Giles off campus, and they discover some vamps making trouble - one of whom is the transcriber who once worked for Spike.

As Buffy and one of the vamps scuffle, they go flying through the window of the Bronze where the surprise party awaits. Newcomer Oz is startled to see Buffy slay one of them, and now he's officially part of the gang. They open the box the vamps were carrying, and it contains an arm which reaches out and chokes Buffy. Angel explains there was a creature called The Judge who destroyed everyone who was righteous. He was finally dismembered by an army, but his parts still exist, and reassembling him would bring on Armageddon. Angel says he must take that arm to the other side of the world, and must leave by boat immediately. Buffy joins him at the dock to say goodbye, and he gives her a claddagh ring as a token of his love. As they say goodbye, the vamps are back and the arm is stolen.

Dru's party is in full swing, and The Judge is the main attraction. His first conquest is the transcriber, who he ignites with just a touch. When Buffy and Angel go to the factory to see if they can find any more parts, they see it's too late, and The Judge spots them. They escape to Angel's pad, where he finally tells her he loves her. They make love and go to sleep. An undressed Angel awakens with a start and runs outside, suddenly fully dressed in black, and collapses. He calls Buffy's name but she stays asleep... @{"[to be continued...]" LINK "INNOCENCE"}

@{b}More Information@{ub}

After the nightmares that the return of the Master caused Buffy in @{"When She Was Bad" LINK "WHENSHEWASBAD"} you'd think that the Slayer and her buddies would have made more effort to ensure that Drusilla was really dead (at the end of @{"What's My Line" LINK "WHATSMYLINE2"}), especially when, from that episode's closing scene, she wouldn't have been too difficult to find! Never mind, this episode sees the welcome return of Drusilla and Spike, who, heavily scarred, is now confined to a wheelchair.

The gradual shift towards turning the series into a romantic soap opera, perhaps in an attempt to broaden its demographic appeal to more female viewers, is halted in its tracks with this terrific episode, which re-writes the 'Buffy' rulebook. Buffy and Angel have finally done the dirty deed, and now they're going to pay for it. The two-part stories have traditionally tackled important events, and this is no exception. Marti Noxon's first solo script is a perfect example of good writing, and is replete with sharp dialogue and meaningful character development. Director Michael Lange (who has also helmed episodes of 'The X-Files' and 'American Gothic') handles every aspect of the production perfectly; getting perky performances from his cast, and creating contrasting moments of genuine tension and cosy intimacy.

Oz becomes a fully in-the-know member of the Scooby gang in this episode, graduating with his cool reaction to the news that vampires are real, and that a lot of them live in Sunnydale: "Actually, it explains a lot!"

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

This is the episode where Angel gives Buffy the claddagh ring. It's also the source of the clip in the third season's title sequence with Willow and the monkey.

Willow and Oz officially start dating, after she invites him to Buffy's birthday party. Brian Thompson, who appeared as the Master's servant, Luke, in the @{"Welcome To..." LINK "WELCOMETOHELLMOUTH"} and @{"The Harvest" LINK "THEHARVEST"} returns as The Judge.

'Surprise' reveals Jenny Calendar's true reason for being in Sunnydale, and introduces her gypsy uncle, played by unforgettable character actor Vincent Schiavelli, whose lengthy list of credits include appearances in 'Tomorrow Never Dies' as an urbane torturer, the subway ghost in 'Ghost' and as Salieri's valet in 'Amadeus'.

Fancy a coat like Spike's? Start saving, because in it's new state - before it was "distressed" (dirtied down) by the costume department - it cost about £1000.

@{b}Chris's Notes@{ub}

The scene in Buffy's dream at the beginning of the episode, when Joyce turns to Buffy and says "Do you really think you're ready?" could have two meanings. The first is explained later in the episode - Buffy wants to starts driving. It could also be a reference to Buffy and Angel's relationship, which reaches it's climax (cough, so to speak) later on in the episode.

5V14

Follows on from @{"Surprise" LINK "SURPRISE"}.

Buffy awakens to find Angel gone. Angel is in the street, still calling her name. A woman stops to see if he's in trouble, and he slays her. He's Angelus again. Meanwhile, the gang at school, who pulled an all-nighter trying to track down The Judge's parts, are worried about Buffy. She shows up and tells them what they just figured out - The Judge is already assembled. Angel returns to the factory, and The Judge can't kill him, which confirms that he's pure evil once again.

Xander and Cordelia's secret smooching is witnessed by Willow, who's completely crushed. Buffy finally finds Angel in his apartment, but he's distant, snotty and generally obnoxious. She is devastated. Jenny's uncle says that if Angel experiences one moment of true happiness, his soul will be taken and Angelus will return. This freaks out Jenny, who realizes that many people will die. As Willow and Xander try to make up, Angel appears at school and asks Willow to approach him. Jenny shows up with a cross and Angel grabs Willow, trying to bite her. Buffy enters and he kisses her, then shoves her and leaves. Giles says some event must have triggered this transformation, but Buffy won't say, leaving Willow to figure out that they must have made love. Buffy goes home and sobs. She dreams of her special night with Angel, then of a funeral where Jenny is in black. She busts into Jenny's class, demanding to know what she knows. Jenny admits she's a watcher sent to keep Angel from happiness, so he'd pay for what he did. Buffy tells her to restore his curse to make him human again. Xander decides that even though no forged weapon could kill The Judge, that was way before today's technology, so he sneaks in an army base using what he learned when he became a soldier on @{"Halloween" LINK "HALLOWEEN"}. Buffy, Giles and Jenny discover her uncle's body - Angel killed him. The Judge, who was weak from all those years of not killing, is finally ready to take over the world. The gang wonders where he'll find the crowds he wants, since the Bronze is closed, and Oz suggests the movies at the mall. The Judge is there, preparing to vaporize everyone. Wielding the biggest, baddest gun imaginable, Buffy shoots The Judge. He's toast - well, at least dismembered again - and the crowd is saved. But Angel still wants to kill Buffy. She doesn't have the heart to slay him, but gives him a wicked kick in the groin, which knocks him to the floor.

Giles warns Buffy that Angel is sure to keep pursuing her in his new evil incarnation, but he doesn't scold her for what happened. She and her mom have a belated birthday celebration, but Buffy doesn't even want to make a wish on her candle, and just forlonly puts her head on her mom's shoulder and watches a romantic old movie.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

When you've followed 'BtVS' for a while you'll notice that once or twice a season the producers like to stir things up, like a small boy poking a stick into an ant's nest. This two-part story is outstanding. By the end of it there's hardly a character whose life hasn't undergone some emotional turmoil or a dramatic upheaval. Whedon's script, which ruminates on friendship, loyalty, trust and betrayal, has beautifully honed dialogue, and exhibits his customary command of the dynamic relationships between the lead characters.

Angel's reversion to the dark side is a wholly welcome dramatic masterstroke, and introduces some tantalising sexual rivalry between Spike and Angel for Drusilla's affections. As the revitalised Angel David Boreanaz is finally given something more to do than mope about looking sulky, and makes the threat he now poses to Buffy seem quite tangible: "She made me feel like a human being. That's not the kind of thing you just forgive."

It's Juliet Landau as Drusilla who steals the show, though, with a mesmerising portrayal of madness. There's a magical moment when she tells Spike she's named all the stars: "But I've named them all the same name, and there's terrible confusion."

If there's one disappointing aspect to 'Innocence', it's that The Judge, whose ominous reputation had been trumpeted throughout @{"Surprise" LINK "SURPRISE"} turns out to be a rather impotent villain, and this deflates some of the episode's power. The way he is dispatched, though, is satisfying, and amusingly confounds the audience's expectations.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

The shopping mall scenes were shot inside a Los Angeles department store. Elaborate preparations included constructing a trench to stop the water from the sprinkler system from flooding the shop. The mall's cinema is heavily featured in the episode, and posters for 'Quest For Camelot', a film being promoted by Warner Brothers at the time, are featured quite prominently!

The film Buffy's watching at the end of the episode is 'Stowaway', a 1936 musical starring Shirley Temple, Alice Faye and Robert Young.

5V15

Willow meets up with Oz in front of one of the school's trophy cases. He has been checking out the moving eyes in one of the cheerleading statues, the same one in which Amy's mother, the witch, is trapped. They discuss their date the previous night, before Willow spots Buffy and walks outside with her. Willow is worried because Oz hasn't tried to kiss her yet, although she is happy that he is being so nice and respectful. Later that night, Xander and Cordelia make out in her car, which is parked in the woods. Xander hears a noise but Cordelia, having not heard the noise, continues to make fun of him and his relationships with Buffy and Willow. Then suddenly the hairy arm of a werewolf breaks through the roof of the car. Cordy throws the car in reverse then brakes, sending the werewolf tumbling off of the car. They then drive out as fast as they can. The next morning, Xander tells Giles that they encountered a werewolf. Giles is quite excited, for he has never personally dealt with a werewolf case before.

In gym, the class is studying self-defence. Xander's latent jealousy of Oz's relationship with Willow is becoming more and more obvious. Buffy tries to pretend she's a normal girl, but when Larry grabs her behind during a throw session, Buffy flips him over her shoulder and onto the mat. Back at the library, Giles has learned that a werewolf goes on the prowl on the night of the full moon and the two nights surrounding it, making that a total of three nights in every month.

Later that night, one of Buffy's classmates, Theresa, is walking home alone when she bumps in Angel, who offers to walk her home. Meanwhile, Buffy and Giles investigate Lover's Lane in the woods, hoping to find the werewolf and bring it back alive, for it is still a human twenty-eight days out of the month. Buffy gets trapped in a net that lifts her to the top of the trees. As she calls for help from Giles, a poacher named Cain appears with a shotgun. After realizing that his catch is not a werewolf, he cuts the net down, and Giles helps Buffy out. Cain explains that he hunts werewolves to make money. He then asks them if they know where else the teenagers might hang out, since werewolves are attracted to sexual heat. Buffy feigns ignorance, so Cain leaves and goes off on his own.

Buffy and Giles then drive towards the Bronze, which fits Cain's description perfectly. As they arrive there, dozens of frightened teens evacuate the Bronze, for the werewolf has already arrived. Buffy runs inside by herself and pulls a chain out of her backpack. She tries to tie up the werewolf, but it breaks free of the chain and escapes. While Buffy and Giles deal with Cain, who is upset that she tried to capture it instead of kill it, the werewolf wanders down the alleys when it discovers Theresa's body. There are two bite marks on its neck, and all the blood has been drained from its body. The werewolf looks up and sees Angel. The two growl at each other, but do not attack. Angel eventually backs off and disappears.

Early next morning before sunrise, Buffy and Giles hear on the radio that Theresa was found dead, and her murder may be linked to the werewolf. They now have only night left before the werewolf goes into remission for the remainder of the month. As the sun rises, the werewolf slowly transforms back to human form while it is sleeping. Once all the hair fades away to reveal flesh, we see that the werewolf is Oz. After waking up and realizing that he is naked in the woods, Oz suspects that he may be the werewolf. He goes home and calls his aunt. Oz asks her about his cousin Jordy, who bit him recently. Apparently, his aunt knows that Jordy is a werewolf, and since he bit Oz, the curse has been passed along. Oz goes to school that day in a daze, and he is horrified to learn that he may have killed Theresa the previous night. Xander suspects that Larry may be the werewolf, so he leaves to question him in the locker room. Willow invites Oz to help her do some research later that night, but Oz refuses and runs off, leaving Willow upset over his apparent change of heart. In the locker room, Xander confronts Larry in the locker room. Xander tells him that he knows the secret that Larry has been hiding, only to find out that Larry's secret is his homosexuality. Misunderstanding Xander's words, Larry now believes that Xander is also gay, but assures him that their secret is safe between them. Feeling relieved and better about himself, Larry thanks Xander and walks off.

Realizing that the police reports never mentioned anything about Theresa being mauled, Buffy and Xander visit the funeral home and inspect Theresa's body. Sure enough, they find two bite marks on her neck, signifying death by vampire. While Buffy signs the guestbook, Theresa suddenly gets up behind her, only now her face is that of a vampire. In the middle of their fight, Theresa throws Buffy off guard by saying that Angel sent her. Luckily, Xander is able to stake her through the back before she can take advantage of Buffy's disoriented state. After being helped up, Buffy embraces Xander for a short while, expressing her fear of Angel's relentlessness. She then realizes her position, gathers herself together, and leaves, with Xander following behind. Elsewhere, Oz knows that he must not be able to leave the house that night, so brings out a box of chains and shackles.

Before Oz can lock himself up, Willow knocks on the door. She is obviously upset by his decision to stay home and do nothing by himself instead of spending the time with her. Oz tries to warn her of the danger, but it is too late, for his transformation has already begun. Willow screams and runs out of the house, while the werewolf chases her down the block and into the woods. Before he can attack Willow, a different scent catches the werewolf's nose, so he leaves Willow alone. She runs off to the library, where Giles is loading up a tranquilizer gun. Willow tells Giles and Buffy that Oz is the werewolf, so they rush out to the woods. Buffy kicks the shotgun out of Cain's hand just before he pulls the trigger. After knocking Cain down, Buffy fights the werewolf, which prevents Giles from getting a clean shot. Buffy is then knocked into Giles and Willow. As the werewolf charges them, Willow grabs the tranquilizer gun and shoots him, causing him to stumble back and collapse. As Cain gets up, Buffy bends his gun with her bare hands, then orders him to leave.

The next day, Oz tells Willow that he'll be fine, as long as he locks himself up around the full moon every month. To his surprise, Willow is still interested in continuing their relationship. As she leaves, Willow kisses Oz for the first time.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

The first half of this episode is a relatively straightforward whodunnit reminiscent of the kitsch 1974 movie 'The Beast Must Die', (based on a story by James Blish called 'There Shall Be No Darkness'), and it's only once the identity of the werewolf has been revealed that the story begins to sparkle. If anything the story is rather too incident-packed. There are several plot threads all competing for space, and sadly a few of them don't get enough to screen time to work satisfactorily. Cain, the macho werewolf hunter, suffers most from attention deficit disorder, and is rather underwritten. (Incidentally, he's given a first name - Gib - in the episode's official synopsis, probably indicating that there may have been some scripted scenes featuring him that were dropped from the final version).

Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali's fourth script for the series has real depth, and gently plays with gender roles without becoming dull, or undermining the main thrust of the drama. Bruce Seth Green is a director with a lot of experience with genre shows, and he handles the difficult action and the human-to-werewolf transformation scenes very ably. The special effects team deserve credit, too, for creating a werewolf costume that wouldn't disgrace a well-budgeted feature film. If you enjoyed this episode, check out Joe Dante's excellent 1981 movie 'The Howling'!

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

The episode opens with Oz admiring the cheerleading trophy that was featured in @{"The Witch" LINK "THEWITCH"}. There are lots of other continuity references in the episode, including allusions to @{"The Pack" LINK "THEPACK"}, @{"I Robot You Jane" LINK "IROBOTYOU"} and @{"Teacher's Pet" LINK "TEACHERSPET"}

Bruce Seth Green's credits include episodes of 'American Gothic', 'Babylon 5' and 'V'. More appropriately, he has also directed as episodes of 'Airwolf' and 'The She Wolf of London'! He's not related to Seth Green (Oz), in case you were wondering.

"The only way you could get other girls to like you would be witchcraft!" - Cordelia

The night before Valentine's Day, Xander shows Buffy his V-Day gift for Cordy: a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant. After cracking a few jokes, Buffy assures Xander that Cordy will love his gift. She then slays a vampire which rises from its grave, and they continue on with their conversation.

The next morning, Harmony and her friends are shunning Cordy from their discussion groups. They mock Cordy for dating Xander, whom they perceive to be one of the biggest losers in Sunnydale. Elsewhere, Amy asks Willow and Buffy if they plan on attending the V-Day party at the Bronze later that night. Willow is going to see Oz play in the band, while Buffy plans on staying home. As everyone leaves and hands in their assignment, Xander notices that Amy does not have a paper to turn in. To his surprise, he watches as Amy stares at Miss Beakman, the teacher. Miss Beakman then reaches out her hand, as if she is taking Amy's paper which doesn't even exist. Amy then turns and leaves. Xander catches up with Buffy and Willow, telling them that he suspects Amy of messing around with witchcraft. Buffy and Willow remind him that it was Amy's mother, Catherine, who was the witch, and that Amy would never fool around with it. Giles spots Buffy and approaches her. Jenny Calendar sees them and walks over, but Giles brushes her off, saying that he and Buffy are busy at the moment. In the library, Giles warns Buffy that Angel has a long past of committing horrid acts on Valentine's Day. He refuses to tell Buffy any specifics, however, but he does suggest that she be careful. Meanwhile, in the factory, Spike and Angel give Drusilla their V-Day gifts. Spike gives her a necklace, while Angel gives her a freshly torn-out heart.

That night, Buffy receives a box of roses, which were left at her doorstep. Buffy opens the box and finds a card with only one word written on it: "Soon". At the Bronze, Xander sees Cordy and walks over to give her his gift. After admiring the necklace for a moment, Cordy breaks up with him. Xander is righteously furious, and it only gets worse for him the next day, as everyone in school seems to know that they broke up. Xander then notices Amy walking around, so he runs over and tells her that he knows she's practicing witchcraft. With the upper hand, Xander strikes a deal with Amy: help him cast a love spell on Cordy, and nobody will have to know that she's a witch. After arguing the idea for a while, Amy concedes and tells Xander that she needs a personal item of Cordelia's.

Xander finds Cordy near her locker and demands that she return the necklace he gave her. Cordy says it's in her locker, but when she opens it, she hides behind the locker door so she can remove the necklace from her neck without Xander seeing. Meanwhile, Buffy walks into the library and shows Giles the "Soon" card. Buffy demands that Giles tell her everything she needs to know about Angel and Valentine's Day, so Giles sits her down and proceeds to read various anecdotes from his books.

In a darkened room, Amy and Xander perform the spell that should cause Cordy to fall in love with him. However, Xander soon finds out that the spell had no effect on Cordy. He walks into the library where Buffy is still listening to Giles read his books. Buffy consoles Xander, then suggests that they spend some time together that night. Buffy's suggestions get increasingly lurid, but before they get too close, Amy walks in and tells Xander that she needs to have a word with him. Outside in the hall, Amy tells Xander that the spell didn't work. Xander could care less know, seeing how his dreams of Buffy and himself are finally being fulfilled. However, Amy then suggests that they spend some time together later that night, without the spells and other witchcraft. Xander grows suspicious, and his fears are confirmed when another girl approaches and asks him to accompany her that night. Xander realizes that the spell actually worked. However, instead of affecting Cordy, it zapped every other girl in Sunnydale. Xander goes home to avoid everybody, only to find Willow waiting for him in his bed. Willow wants to him to take her right there in his bed, and when things get a little too steamy between them, Xander pushes her off and runs off.

The next day, every single girl in the school ogles Xander as he walks down the hall. He quickly enters the library and tells Giles everything that's going on. Before Giles can process the information, Jenny walks in and tells Giles that they need to talk. However, her attention quickly shifts to Xander, proving that the spell affected not only the girls, but every single female in town. Giles gets between the two and berates Xander for causing all this to happen. He then leaves Xander in the library, dragging Jenny along with him. After they leave, Xander tries to barricade the entrance to the library, but Buffy simply walks in, wearing nothing but a raincoat. She seductively asks Xander to undress her, but he can't, for he knows that what Buffy is doing is not out of attraction for him, but simply a result of the spell. Just then, Amy arrives and tells Buffy to leave. Instead, Buffy punches her to the floor. Angered, Amy gets up and casts a spell on Buffy, turning her into the small rat. Giles and Jenny return just then. While Xander and Giles try to catch the rat, Oz walks into the library and punches Xander for whatever he did to depress Willow. While Xander assures Oz that nothing happened, the rat escapes through the partly-opened library door. Realizing that the rat is gone, Giles commands Xander and Oz to find the rat while he tries to get Amy to reverse the spells. Giles soon determines that Amy must have made a mistake in the casting that caused Cordy to be protected by the spell instead of affected by it.

In the hallway, Xander notices a fight breaking out. To his horror, he sees a mob of girls beating on Cordy. The mob is angry at Cordy for breaking Xander's heart. Rushing in through the love-crazed girls, Xander pulls Cordy out of the pack and runs away with her. They run outside, only to find Willow and dozens of other girls. Willow is wielding an axe, for she would rather see Xander dead than with Cordy. While the mobs of girls battle each other, Xander and Cordy escape through the commotion and end up at Buffy's house.

Joyce lets them in and, after sending Cordy upstairs to get some bandages, starts seducing Xander. Cordy is sickened by this, so she pushes Joyce outside. Joyce punches through the door window and struggles to unlock the door, so Xander and Cordy run upstairs and hide in Buffy's room. Thinking they're safe, Angel suddenly arrives and pulls Xander through the window and throws him to the ground below. Before Angel can kill him, Drusilla arrives and protects Xander. While Angel leaves, Dru offers immortal life to Xander. Before she can sink his teeth into his neck, the mob of girls finally track them down. They pull Xander away from Dru and pile up on top of Xander. Cordy runs out and pulls Xander out from the pile before quickly running back inside. All the girls chase them into the house. That is, everyone except Dru. Angel reminds her that she can't get in without an invitation. Xander and Cordy run into the basement and lock themselves in there. Meanwhile, Oz tracks the rat into the school basement. The rat is first menaced by a cat, then approaches a mouse trap. Upstairs, Giles and Amy perform the reversal spells. They first reverse the spell on Buffy, causing her to transform back to her human self. She quickly realizes that she is completely naked, so she asks Oz to find her some clothes.

While Giles and Amy work on reversing the love spell, the mob of girls break open the basement door. Xander and Cordy run downstairs, but there's nowhere to go. Soon, all the girls gang up on top of them. Finally, Giles and Amy complete the reversal spell, and everybody returns to normal. All the girls look around, completely confused as to what's going on. Cordy makes up an excuse that they had just finished a scavenger hunt.

The next day, Buffy thanks Xander for not taking advantage of her the previous day. It seems that everybody retained their memory of what occurred during the run of the spell. Xander then bumps into Harmony, who is walking with Cordy and the rest of their friends. After Harmony mocks Xander, Cordy has had enough. She rips on Harmony and tells everybody that she can date whoever she wants to date. Cordy then walks over to Xander and takes his hand. Cordy is horrified by what she's just done, but Xander comforts her, and the two of them walk off, together again.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

Of all the regular characters, it's Xander that's least likely to be the focus of any particular episode. He plays an important role in every episode, providing much of the humour that's made the series so popular and accessible, but he's a follower rather than an instigator. 'Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered' is a formulaic episode that seems to have been created as some kind of loyalty bonus for Nicholas Brendon, who manages to carry things very adeptly.

Marti Noxon nails the spurned Xander's motivation for starting the trouble in this episode in one line: "I want her to want me desperately, so I can break up with her, and subject her to the same hell she's been putting me through". Thanks to Amy and the lovelorn Xander we get to see a whole new side to several characters, most notably the sultry version of Willow!

The episode is enlivened by Christophe Beck's wonderfully energetic score and, especially, by James Contner's imaginative direction. Contner manages to bring a sense of momentum that probably wasn't apparent from the script, and also instils the episode with a sense of creeping terror. He also draws winning performances from the cast, who probably haven't had this much fun since @{"Halloween" LINK "HALLOWEEN"}.

Noxon's witty script contains a lot of sparkling dialogue, including one sly line that qualifies as one of the series' best, when Angel delivers a still-warm human heart to Drusilla, as a Valentine's Day present: "I found it in a quaint little shop girl." The episode's official synopsis contains a minor detail that didn't make the final edit: when the love potion spell is broken, Amy hands her spell book to Giles. Its omission is possibly a sign that the series' producers aren't quite finished with Amy yet...

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

It's rather apt that it's Oz who finds the naked Buffy in the school basement, after her spell as a rat, since it's a predicament he must have found himself in many times before, as in @{"Phases" LINK "PHASES"}. For an amusing elaboration of this scenario, see John Landis' superb 1981 movie 'An American Werewolf In London'.

"Sorry Jenny... This is where you get off." - Angel

Buffy wakes up in the morning to discover a piece of paper sitting on her pillow. She unfolds it to discover a sketch of her face while she was sleeping. Buffy knows that Angel must have been in her bedroom during her sleep. At the library, Buffy pleads to Giles that he find a spell that would reverse the invitation into her home. Buffy and Giles then stop by Jenny Calendar's computer class to meet Willow, who has just been assigned by Jenny to fill in as class teacher the next day for the first few minutes. As Buffy and Willow leave, Jenny does her best to apologize to Giles, who insists that Buffy is the one who deserves the apology. Jenny also gives Giles a book that she has been reading since Angel lost his soul. That night, Buffy tells her mother during dinner that Angel has been sort of stalking her lately. Buffy asks Joyce to never invite him into the house. Later, Buffy talks to Willow over the phone. During their conversation, Willow notices an envelope on her bed. She opens it and discovers that all the fish from her aquarium have been removed and strung along a wire, which she slowly pulls out of the envelope. Willow quickly retreats to Buffy's house to spend the night.

At the factory the next morning, Spike grows increasingly tired of Angel's presence. Their argument is interrupted by Drusilla, who falls onto the table in pain, for she senses something going on that may endanger them. What she senses is Jenny's visit to the local craft shop. Jenny purchases an Orb of Thesulah which she needs to restore Angel's soul. The shopkeeper warns her that the transliteration annals have been lost for many years, but Jenny tells him that she's working on a computer program that could translate the text. The next morning, Giles gives Jenny's book to Buffy and points out the revoking spell that he just found. Buffy and Willow first help Cordy perform the steps on her car. The three of them then perform the spell in Willow's house. While there, Cordy notices a piece of paper left on Willow's bed. Willow unfolds it, then hands it to Buffy. It is a sketch of Joyce, asleep and completely unaware of Angel's presence. Buffy and Willow race to her house to perform the spell. Joyce soon pulls into the driveway, where Angel waits for her to get out of the car. Angel pleads with Joyce to help him get Buffy back, and he eventually mentions the night they made love. Joyce finally unlocks the front door and enters the house. Angel tries to follow her in, but a force holds him back. He then sees Buffy and Willow coming down the steps, and the door is promptly slammed in front of him. Back in Jenny's classroom, Giles walks in. She tells him that she may have some good news, so Giles invites her to stop by his house later. Meanwhile, Drusilla visits the shopkeeper after hours and asks him what he's been up to with Jenny Calendar.

Jenny finally completes her program. She saves the translated text on a floppy disk which she removes from the disk drive. As she prints out the text, she notices that Angel is sitting in the classroom. He destroys the Orb of Thesulah, her computer, and the print-out. Angel then chases Jenny through the school halls before finally catching her in front of the second floor window. In a single instant, Angel snaps Jenny's neck, then drops her to the floor.

Meanwhile, Giles stops by Buffy's house to pick up Jenny's book so he can perform the revoking spell at his house. Upstairs, Joyce talks with Buffy about her irresponsibility. When Giles gets home, he hears opera music playing and finds a rose on his door. He enters and finds chilled wine, glasses, and a note that simply reads "Upstairs". He follows a path of roses up the staircase, but what he finds is everything but romantic. Jenny's dead body lies in his bed, and Giles drops the glasses and wine to the floor. Giles stares blankly ahead as the coroners take Jenny's body out of the house. The cops then ask Giles to come with them to the police station to answer a few questions. Giles asks if he could first use the phone. As the phone rings at Buffy's house, Angel watches from outside, through the windows. He watches Buffy's face as she gives the phone, then slowly collapses against the wall behind her. Willow immediately bursts into tears, and Joyce runs in to console her. After a while of recovery, Xander and Cordy arrive to give Buffy and Willow a lift to Giles' house. At this very moment, Giles stuffs his weapons into a duffel bag and takes off for the factory. Buffy and the others arrive too late, but they know where he's headed. At the factory, Giles throws a flame bomb into the middle of the floor, setting it ablaze.

Before Angel can run, an arrow pins him against a post behind him. As he pulls it out, Giles ignites a club in the flames and proceeds to beat Angel repetitively with it. Finally, Angel grabs Giles by the neck and picks him up, but Buffy arrives just in time to take over the fight. Their battle carries on to the catwalk above, but before Buffy can finish Angel off, he reminds her of Giles, who remains collapsed by the rapidly spreading flames. He then throws Buffy over the rail, but she lands on her feet and rescues Giles, thus allowing to Angel to escape once again. Outside, Giles is furious at Buffy for interfering in his fight, but she punches him and tells him to never leave her alone.

Another day, another morning, Giles and Buffy stand over Jenny's grave. Buffy has finally realized that she is ready to finish Angel. In the computer classroom, Willow takes over as substitute teacher until the new teacher can arrive. As she arranges Jenny's desk, she unknowingly drops a disk through a crack between the desk and a file cabinet. There the disk lies, the key to Angel's restoration.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

With its gloriously morose voice-over narration, 'Passion' is a terribly sombre episode, darker in tone than any other in Season Two. Much of the episode is typical of the series, but it plummets into previously unexplored depths. For the first twenty-seven minutes it's all doom and gloom, and then it gets even worse.

It's a cruel episode, one that takes its cue from Angel's "gag gifts". It plays with the audience's expectations, setting them up for one thing, and then delivering another. Its pivotal event - Angel killing Jenny - is genuinely distressing, and completely shocking. It marks a turning point in the series, and for several of its characters, ending the entente cordiale between Angel and Giles. It's a scene that's perfectly shot and beautifully mounted by director Michael Gershman, giving the series one of it's most memorable sequences.

Ty King's grim tale doesn't quite achieve the balance between horror and humour, and some of the more comedic touches fall flat, like tasteless jokes at a funeral. Nevertheless, it's a compelling story, and one that will confound anyone who thinks that the series was going soft. There are numerous almost incidental elements that make 'Passion' so enjoyable: the character of the Juju man ("I just love those New Agers, they helped to send my youngest to college!"); the increasing sexual tension between Spike, Angel and Drusilla; Willow's temporary conversion to Catholicism; and "the talk" between Joyce and Buffy.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Pop culture: Xander's line "If Giles wants to go after the fiend who murdered his girlfriend, I say 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'" is a reference to Russ Meyer's 1966 kitsch classic 'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill'. The film also inspired the name of a punk rock band.

Director Michael Gershman more usually serves as the series' Director of Photography.

Jenny's computer disk falls between two desks at the end of the episode, but don't think that will be the last you see of it.

@{b}Killed By Death@{ub}
5V18

The flu has been spreading around Sunnydale High, and Buffy's one of the unlucky souls who's got it. While on a routine patrol through the cemetery, Buffy runs into Xander, Willow, and Cordelia. Before she can get them to go home, Angel appears and attacks Cordy. Buffy fends him off, but the flu has made her too weak to fight him effectively. Angel nearly bites Buffy when the others come to her aid and thwart him back with their crosses. After Angel leaves, Buffy collapses and lies on the ground, unconscious.

The gang brings Buffy to the emergency room of Sunnydale General. Giles and Joyce soon arrive, and they wait for Buffy to be moved to another room so they could see her. On the way to room, Buffy realizes that she's going to be there awhile, so she tries to get out, screaming that she has to kill the vampires. Dr. Wilkinson injects a tranquilizer to calm her down. Soon, Buffy is asleep in her new room while the others wait outside in the hall. Joyce tells everyone that Buffy has been afraid of hospitals ever since she saw her cousin Celia die in a hospital when they were both very young. The group goes home while Xander stays behind to protect Buffy in case Angel shows up. That night, Buffy is still overcome with her fever when she notices a young boy standing in her doorway. As the boy walks away, Buffy sees a tall, demonic man following the boy. He is dressed in black clothes and a black hat, and his fingers are long and pointed. Buffy gets out of her bed to follow them, but she soon finds herself in a flashback to a time when she was much younger, walking down a similar hospital hallway. As her young self walks into a room and approaches the bed curtains, Buffy wakes up, realizing that she was just dreaming.

She then gets out of bed and walks down the hall. She stops outside of a door from which a body of a recently diseased girl is being wheeled out of. Buffy eavesdrops on Dr. Wilkinson talking with another doctor, Dr. Stanley Backer. Dr. Wilkinson is arguing about some kind of experimental procedure that Dr. Backer has been performing on the children. Buffy then notices two children standing before her. One of them is the same boy she saw earlier, who tells her that Death is coming for them, and that he can't be seen by grownups. Elsewhere, Angel walks into the hospital, holding some flowers for Buffy. Xander blocks his path and challenges him to a fight, but Angel simply points out Xander's apparent jealousy of Angel for getting to Buffy first. Angel then turns around and leaves.

The next morning, Buffy's fever has gone down, and the gang pays her a visit. Buffy tells them about the apparent demon she saw walking the halls, the one that grownups can't see, but also notes that she may have just been delusional from her fever. She also tells them about the girl who died and Dr. Backer's experiments. Giles and Willow return to the library to do some research while Xander and Cordy snoop around the hospital for more info. They find nothing, so Xander decides to stay behind and watch after Buffy. Cordy is upset with him for his obvious attraction that he still holds for Buffy, but she later returns with donuts and coffee to keep Xander company. In the meantime, Giles and Willow concoct a theory that the kids think they're seeing Death, but they're really seeing Dr. Backer. Willow researches his background, but can't find much to convict him of anything.

Later that night, Buffy sneaks out of her room again. She heads for the children's ward, where Dr. Backer is preparing to inject a sleeping girl with an unknown solution. He then hears something, but it is too late, for an invisible force attacks the doctor, slashing away at his body. The young boy, Ryan, wakes up and watches in horror as Dr. Backer is slashed to death by the demon. Buffy looks in and sees Dr. Backer being attacked, but she can't see the attacker. His lifeless body is then thrown out of the room, and before Buffy can reach it, she is knocked back by the unseen force. She lies against the wall, unconscious, while Dr. Backer's body is dragged down the hall and out of sight.

The next morning, Buffy tells the gang that Backer is no longer their suspect, then shows them a drawing that Ryan made of the demon. Joyce arrives and tells Buffy that she's been cleared to go home, but Buffy makes up an excuse that she's still not feeling well so she can stay in the hospital and fight the demon. Willow stays to help Buffy investigate Dr. Backer's office for clues as to why he was killed, while Xander elects to stand guard at the hospital. This leaves Giles to reluctantly work with Cordy in the library. In Dr. Backer's office, Willow finds a log proving that Backer was innoculating the kids with the same virus they were infected with in an attempt to raise their temperature and burn out their fever. According the log, the process was starting to work, so Backer really was helping the children all along. At the library, Cordy notices that a picture on the cover of a book resembles the picture that Ryan drew. She calls Buffy and tells them that the name of the demon is Der Kindestod. Giles then tells Buffy that Kindestod kills its victims by sitting on top of them and pinning them on their backs. It then sucks the life out of them somehow.

Buffy suddenly has another flashback to her earlier years. The younger Buffy walks into the room and opens the curtains, only to see Celia screaming with her hands in front of her, as if she is trying to push some invisible object off of her. Buffy realizes that her cousin Celia was killed by Kindestod. After hanging up the phone, Buffy realizes that the only time she was able to see the Kindestod was when she was still under the effects of her fever. Willow and Buffy sneak into Backer's office again. Buffy opens the refrigerator and removes a test tube that contains the same virus strain that Backer was using in his experiments. Willow dilutes it with water before Buffy drinks it. Sick again, Buffy stumbles to the children's ward with Willow's help. However, all the children are no longer in their room. Buffy then sees Kindestod walking around inside the room, then entering a door labelled "Basement Access". The door is locked, so Buffy needs to find another way to the basement. Dr. Wilkinson walks into the hallway and tries to get Buffy back to her room, but Buffy pushes her away, and she and Willow run for it. Two security guards stop them, but Willow throws an imaginary fit to divert the guards while Buffy slips by. She finds Xander, and the two of them head down to the basement. They find Ryan pinned to the floor by Kindestod, while the rest of the children sit together screaming. Buffy fights Kindestod while Xander moves the others to safety. Before Kindestod can drain Buffy of her life force, she grabs his head with both hands and snaps his neck, killing him instantly.

The next morning, Buffy is back in the comfort of her own bedroom. Xander and Willow are also there, keeping her company while she recovers from her fever again. Joyce brings Buffy a letter that just arrived in the mail. It's from Ryan, and Buffy opens it to find a drawing of Buffy standing victoriously over the body of Kindestod, it's neck cracked open and blood spurting out.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

'Killed by Death' is a very disappointing episode that blatantly "borrows" from Wes Craven's 1984 horror classic 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' for its ideas, and even some of its imagery. Moving Buffy into the hospital diminishes the group dynamic that energises most episodes, and seems to merely be an excuse to use young children as the prey of a supernatural serial killer.

Genuine highlights are few and far between, but pairing up Giles and Cordelia provides much-needed humour in an otherwise gloomy episode ("Boy, there's a demon for everything!"), and the tension between Xander and Angel when they meet at the hospital is rather satisfying ("It must just eat you up that I got there first").

Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali's script is littered with idiotic contrivances, and obvious plot holes. There are signs that this episode had a troubled production. Established character actor Richard Herd (the alien leader in 'V') has a throwaway role, and barely any dialogue, as Doctor Stanley Backer; Buffy's fight with the Kindestod is poorly directed, and needed a couple of clumsily-added lines of dialogue to explain what happened; and the last scene seems so superfluous it draws undue attention to itself. It's all a bit of a mess really.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Willow feigns fear of frogs to distract the guards and Doctor Wilkinson, a phobia she first mentioned in @{"What's My Line? - Part One" LINK "WHATSMYLINE1"}. In the original script it was "bats" that were climbing all over here.

Pop culture: when discussing Death, Xander says "If he asks you to play chess, don't even do it, guy's like a whiz!" This is a reference to Ingmar Bergman's wonderful 1957 film 'The Seventh Seal', in which a Knight returning from the Crusades encounters Death, and stalls the Reaper by offering to play chess with him. (If he wins, Death will spare his life. If he loses, Death can take him without a struggle). The scene is iconic, and was mercilessly parodied in the 1991 movie 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey' (amongst others).

5V19

A night at the Bronze does nothing to improve the Slayer's morale, as Willow notices when she sees Buffy reject a guy. Willow tries to help her friend out, but Buffy opts to stop by the school and see if Giles has any work for her to do. Unbeknownst to her, a boy is fighting with a girl in the school hallway. He holds up a gun, and the girl tries to leave the scene. The boy then shouts, "Don't walk away from me, bitch!" Buffy arrives at the school just in time to stop the boy from shooting the girl. Buffy knocks the gun out of his hand, and the boy soon returns to his senses. While he and the girl try to figure out what just happened, the school janitor points out that the gun is nowhere to be seen.

The next morning, Principal Snyder calls Buffy to his office to let her know that he'll be keeping an eye on her. After he leaves the office for a minute, a book mysteriously falls out of the bookshelf. Buffy picks it up, noticing that it's a yearbook from the Sunnydale Class of '55. Meanwhile, Giles stops by the computer classroom, where Willow is still serving as the substitute teacher. She tells Giles about some of the files and pagan websites she found on the computer, then gives him a rose quartz that once belonged to Jenny.

Elsewhere, Buffy has a dream in one of her classes that she's in the year 1955. She watches on as one of the students approaches the teacher. They start to hold hands when someone else interrupts them. Just then, Buffy wakes up from her dream and notices the teacher writing "Don't walk away from me, bitch" on the chalkboard. He doesn't even notice it until the students start laughing. In the hallway, Buffy tells Xander what happened. When they reach his locker, a rotted arm reaches out of it and grabs Xander, trying to pull him in. Buffy helps him loose, and the creature disappears. When Giles finds out about this, he deduces that this is some form of paranormal activity.

Later that night, one of the teachers, Ms. Frank, passes by George the janitor on her way home. Suddenly, they begin to reenact the same conversation that the boy and girl held the night before. While this goes on, Giles is working in his office when he hears a female voice call to him. He believes that it is Jenny's voice. When he walks out to investigate, he sees George and Ms. Frank outside. Before Giles can do anything, the gun goes off, sending Ms. Frank over the edge and onto the steps below. George tries to flee the scene, but Giles tackles him. After the gun is knocked out of George's hands, it suddenly vanishes into thin air. George has no idea what just happened, so Giles fills him in.

The next day, Giles tells the others that he believes the ghost is Jenny. They don't see how the pieces fit, but Giles remains set in his belief. In the computer classroom, Willow looks up any previous shooting victims in the school. She finds a record from 1955, when a student shot his teacher, then himself. Buffy recognizes the faces from her dream, so she grabs a 1955 yearbook and looks them up. The boy was James Stanley, and his teacher was Grace Newman. Buffy determines that they were having an affair. However, Buffy feels no remorse for James's fate, for she feels he deserved whatever punishment there was after shooting Grace.

In the cafeteria, Cordy complains about the upcoming Sadie Hawkins dance when another paranormal event occurs. This time, all of the food transforms into snakes, sending the entire school population into panic. One of the snake bites Cordy's cheek before she swats it away. After they evacuate the school, a team is sent in to clean out the snakes. Principal Snyder talks with his friend on the police force, Bob. Snyder knows that they're on a Hellmouth, but Bob demands Snyder to control the situation, otherwise the mayor would have to get involved. That night, Willow sets up a plan to exorcise the spirit from the school. To do so, Buffy, Xander, Cordelia, and herself need to chant from different locations in the school at midnight, forming what is called a Mangus Tripod. Buffy elects to take the center position, since that is where the most danger would likely occur. After they split up in the school, Willow runs into Giles by the library. He is trying to contact Jenny's spirit, so Willow leaves him alone. As midnight approaches, Buffy sees a vision of James dancing with Grace in the band room. Cordelia inspects her wound in the bathroom mirror, then watches in horror as the whole side of her face turns red and swollen. Willow is suddenly pulled into the floor by an arm, but she is saved by Giles. Buffy watches as James's face is replaced by a rotted skull, which tells her to get out. The clock finally strikes twelve, so the group does the chant simultaneously. However, it doen't work like it's supposed to. A swarm of wasps invades the hallways, and everybody makes a mad dash for the exit. They run to the street, then turn around to witness the swarm surround the entire school.

At Buffy's house, Giles deduces that it is James spirit which is haunting Sunnydale High. He is apparently trying to seek forgiveness from Grace, but that can never happen since she dies before she can possibly forgive him. So, he is doomed to repeat this scenario over and over again. While they try to figure out a solution, Buffy hears a male voice call to her. Without telling the others, she sneaks off to the school. The wasps part to allow her access, and she walks right in. Inside, Buffy meets Angel, who has come to finish things off. However, James spirit possesses Buffy, and she begins to act out the scenario.

Confused for a moment, Angel approaches and is suddenly possessed by Grace's spirit. It all plays out the same way, only this time, Grace (in Angel's body) gets up after being shot and falling onto the steps below. In the band room, James (in Buffy's body) prepares to shoot himself, when Grace stops him. She forgives him, and they share one last kiss before their souls finally cross over, leaving Buffy and Angel in an embrace, kissing like they once did in the past. When Angel realizes what he is doing, he pushes her off and escapes.

Back at the Summers home, Buffy realizes that James never meant to shoot Grace. Apparently, Buffy and James had more in common than she realized, for they were both tormented by guilt. Meanwhile, at their new home in an abandoned garden, Angel tries to cleanse himself from the vile kiss he shared with his enemy. He takes Dru out with him to find some blood, leaving Spike alone. After they leave, Spike rises from his wheelchair and kicks it on its side, knowing that the time for his comeback is nearer than anyone else thinks.

Until the third and final act 'I Only Have Eyes For You' follows a familiar formula, and rehashes old ideas. There are plenty of distractions from the core story: the snakes and the bees are cheap scares; the whirlpool that threatens to swallow Willow, and Cordelia's infection are also rather irksome. They pollute what might otherwise have been a classic story.

Despite that, once all the pieces fall into place, it's impossible not to be charmed by the whole picture. The wonderful ending, where Buffy and Angel re-enact James and Grace's final moments, is such a compelling twist that it suddenly seems that the rest of the episode was written to explain the finale, rather than the other way around. It's an exhilarating and thrilling ending that conjures a wonderful sense of destiny at work: how else could the spell have been broken? A great deal of the credit must go James Whitmore Jr for his masterly narration, but it's also the result of a sparky script by writer Marti Noxon, who turns a straightforward ghost story into a morality tale, and one with fascinating parallels to the current state of Buffy and Angel's relationship.

The episode's last scene, Spike's return to health, is an ill-judged addition: although a very welcome development it drags the episode back to normality, breaking Noxon's carefully woven spell. It sets the scene for the season finale, 'Becoming', but might have been used more effectively as the pre-credits teaser for a subsequent episode.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

When Willow suggests an exorcism, Cordelia replies "Are you crazy? I saw that movie: even the priests died!", referring to the notorious 1973 movie 'The Exorcist', recently released on video in the UK, after being banned for more than fifteen years.

"You just went O.J. on your girlfriend" is a reference to former American Football superstar O.J. Simpson, who was tried for killing his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, in June 1994. After a lengthy, racially devisive and very public trial, the "not guilty" verdict in October 1995 divided pubic opinion in the US. In February 1997 Simpson was found liable for the murders, in a civil trial brought by Goldman's relatives.

This episode can be seen as the beginning of Willow's interest in witchcraft. (There were signs before this, but in this episode Willow has started to explore "paganism and magic and stuff" websites, and says it's "really interesting"). After a few previous hints, (notably in @{"School Hard" LINK "SCHOOLHARD"}), it's revealed that Principal Snyder knows that the school is on the Hellmouth, and is in collusion with the mayor and the authorities.

The episode's title comes from a song by The Flamingos, a rhythm and blues group famous for tight harmonies. It's the song that James and Grace are dancing to, recreating the events of 1955. The only trouble is that the song wasn't recorded until 1958, and wasn't released until 1959, when it became a top 20 hit.

5V20

The beach is the site for the victory party of the Sunnydale High swim team, and everyone's celebrating except Buffy. One of the team members, Cameron, approaches the lonely Slayer and keeps her company. Another team member, Dodd, mocks Jonathan in front of everybody, so Buffy steps in to stop the foolishness. Dodd and fellow member Gage then leave the party and walk along the shore. Suddenly, Dodd disappears without Gage even noticing. He smells a strong odor coming from somewhere, so he decides to return to the party. He doesn't hear Dodd quietly scream in agony, nor does he notice the scaly creature walking away from Dodd's remains.

The next morning, Principal Snyder stops by the computer classroom to talk to Willow about one of her students, Gage. He is currently getting an "F" in the class, and Snyder encourages her to work his grade into a passing one. Meanwhile, Cameron gives a Buffy a ride to school, then tries to put the moves on her. She retaliates by busting his nose on the steering wheel. Principal Snyder sees this and calls the two of them to Nurse Greenliegh's office. The swim team coach, Marin, meets them there, and they discuss their chances for winning the state title. In the library, Buffy learns that Dodd's insides were eaten from some mysterious creature, leaving only his skin behind. Hours later, Xander takes a study break and heads to the vending machine. He bumps into Cameron, who is on his way to the cafeteria. Cam notices a foul smell when he enters the cafeteria, and a horrific scream follows soon after. Xander follows the sound, but he's too late, for all that remains of Cameron is his skin on the cafeteria floor. Xander then turns around and encounters the scaly creature that most likely killed Cameron.

Later, Xander explains to Giles and Cordy that the creature got away before he could get a good look at it. Without Cameron gone, Giles determines the pattern of the killing is connected to the swim team ranks. Dodd and Cameron were the first and second best swimmers on the team, respectively. Since Gage is the third best, he would most likely be the creature's next target. Buffy decides to keep an eye on Gage, while Willow interrogates Jonathan, who has tried out for the team several times but never made it on. All Willow learns is that Jonathan peed in the pool. Later that night, Gage confronts Buffy about her spying on him. She tries to come up with a good excuse, then simply tells Gage what's really going on. He doesn't buy it, so he turns and walks out. Outside, he meets Angel, who promptly sinks his teeth into Gage's neck, hoping to turn him into a demon. Buffy arrives on the scene just in time to witness Angel suddenly withdrawing his fangs from Gage's neck and spitting the blood out. He tosses Gage's weakened body at Buffy and makes his escape, all the while spitting out the blood in disgust. Gage believes Buffy now, so he asks her to walk him home.

At swim practice the next day, Buffy tells Willow and Cordy about Angel's distaste for Gage's blood. She believes that Gage may have been taking steroids, which might have turned Angel off. Willow then considers the possibility that the steroids might be what's attracting the creature. They then find out that Xander has joined the swim team. The position was open due to the recent deaths, so Xander took it as an opportunity to spy on Gage when Buffy couldn't. After spending some time in the steam room, Xander gets dressed and meets Buffy outside of the locker room, telling her that Gage is still inside.

She soon hears Gage screaming and runs inside, where she sees the creature standing in front of Gage. She gets between the two of them, but something's wrong with Gage. To her horror, Buffy watches as Gage tears away his own skin in agony before emerging as the same type of creature standing behind her. Gage's former skin drops to the floor, and he quickly attacks Buffy. The two of them are too much for Buffy, and when her guard drops, one of them bite into her arm. Coach Marin arrives to pull Buffy out of danger, and the two creatures escape through a hole in the floor. Buffy and Giles question Coach Marin, but he denies any knowledge of substance abuse in his team. They can't figure out what's going on, so Buffy assigns Xander to learn more about the team's drug use while she and Willow talk to Nurse Greenliegh. However, Nurse Greenliegh is already being led to her doom by Coach Marin, who won't listen to her pleas to stop the experiments. He drops her into the sewer below, where the fish creatures quickly feed on her.

In the steam room, Xander learns from one of the other members that the steroids are in the steam itself. This means that Xander has been exposed to the same substance that transformed Dodd, Cameron, and Gage. He tells the others that he's already been in the steam room three times, so Buffy talks to Coach Marin. Eventually, he tells her about Russian experiments with fish DNA on their Olympic swimmers. He then draws a gun and orders Buffy to drop into the sewer so his boys could satisfy their "other needs". After dropping down, Buffy sees the chewed-up remains of Nurse Greenliegh floating in the murky water. Upstairs by the pool, Cordy mistakes a newly-emerged fish creature for Xander. She expresses her sorrow for his fate, but Xander shows up again, just in time to save her from the creature's attack. They return to the library, where Giles has locked up the remaining members of the swim team. Xander then goes to see Coach Marin, and they engage in a struggle over the gun. Down below, Buffy fends off the creatures until they finally surround her from all angles. Xander knocks Coach Marin down and extends his arm through the hole for Buffy. She leaps up, grabs Xander's hand, and is pulled to safety.

Coach Marin gets up for one last strike, but Buffy is ready this time. She sweeps him off his feet, sending Marin into the sewer with his swimmers. They converge on him, leaving Coach Marin with nothing to do but scream. Later, Xander tells the others that he has to get a blood transfusion along with the rest of the team, hoping that will prevent them from changing. As they speak, the fish creatures swim out into the ocean, against the current.

There is an interesting theme at the core of this episode: that schools, particularly American schools, treat their more athletically adept pupils differently in order to bolster the school's reputation. There's probably less competition between UK schools, and certainly less pressure on them to better their rivals, but the point is well made.

We see several examples of how the swimming team works to a different set of standards: members playing solitaire - solitaire??! - in Willow's computer lesson, bullying fellow students, and even Cameron attempting to rape Buffy, all of which are virtually ignored to make sure the school's success at sports isn't jeopardised.

We also get to see exactly how far the team members themselves will go in order to win.

It's not surprising that Cordelia has some sympathies with this Nietzsche-like system: "Certain people are entitled to special privileges. They're called winners, That's the way the world works".

All of this would be a little too prosaic to sit comfortably with the series' format, if it wasn't for the fantastical elements, which add interest, and give the episode a modicum of much-needed levity. There are few laughs: Cordelia's rambling speech to Sean, who she mistakes for Xander, is a rare moment of deft humour. It doesn't really sparkle, but Charisma Carpenter delivers it beautifully.

The sea creatures are atypically unimpressive when you see them in close-ups, but they do look pretty svelte underwater. Traditionally similar stories involve situations where humans are invading the domain of the sea creature, and where they are literally out of their element. This episode rarely mines the potential of such situations, and is nowhere near as suspenseful as, for example, the scene in 'Aliens' where a child is standing in a pool from which an alien could appear any moment.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

We knew that Sunnydale had docks (it's where Buffy Angel went to dispose of the Judge's hand, in @{"Surprise" LINK "SURPRISE"}), but here we discover that Sunnydale is a coastal town. So, how come it took thirty-two episodes before there was a scene on the beach!? Pop culture: Xander's line "This was no boating accident" echoes a famous line from 'Jaws', Steven Spielberg's 1977 movie about a killer shark. Xander also makes a reference to the dire 1983-1987 TV series 'The A-Team'.

Willow has a line: "Like an Oreo cookie, except for, you know, without the chocolatey cookie goodness". Oreos are American cream-filled biscuits, which you can also find in some British supermarkets! What you might not know is that Alyson Hannigan (Willow) once appeared in an advert for Oreos.

If you liked this episode, you might want to check out Jack Arnold's great 1954 movie 'The Creature From The Black Lagoon', a film which certainly influenced the design of 'Go Fish''s monsters.

@{b}Becoming - Part One@{ub}
5V21

Galway, 1753 - On his last day as a mortal human, the man who will become Angelus encounters a beautiful, blonde woman on the streets at night. Her name is Darla, and she seduces him closer to her. She sinks her fangs into his neck, then uses her nails to make an incision on her chest, just above her breasts. Immediately, Darla pulls the man's mouth onto her bleeding cut, turning the man into a demon of the night.

Sunnydale, Present - Angel watches Buffy from afar as she battles a pair of vampires. She orders one of them to take a message to Angel, saying that she's taking the offensive. The vampire doesn't comply, so Buffy finishes him off. The next day, Giles pays a visit to the museum, where a newly-discovered stone artifact has been discovered. It is a few feet taller than Giles, and it contains some form of text on the side. Giles asks the man in charge, Doug Perren, if they attempted to open it yet, but Doug didn't notice the crack running down the side of the stone until Giles pointed it out. Giles then asks Doug to refrain from opening it until he can decipher the text. At school, Buffy declares to her friends for the umpteenth time that she's ready to face Angel, despite the fact that final exams are approaching. Willow offers to tutor Buffy in chemistry during one of their free periods.

London, 1860 - Before she became a demon, Drusilla was a young Catholic woman who only wanted to follow the right path in life. She enters a church and steps into the confessional booth, failing to notice one of the priest's arms reaching out in desperation before being pulled back in. Drusilla does not realize that Angelus has just murdered the priest and is now acting in his place behind the confessional screen. After Drusilla tells him of her problem with her visions of the future, Angelus torments her by claiming that she is a child of the devil. Drusilla does not want this to be true, and pleads for help. Finally, Angelus lets her go with a request for Hail Mary's and an act of contrition.

Sunnydale, Present - Drusilla, Spike, and Angelus read about the museum's new artifact in the newspaper. Angelus knows what it is immediately. Back in Sunnydale High, Buffy hopelessly tries to solve a chemistry problem when she accidentally drops her pencil. It rolls off into the desk and falls on the floor, right next to Ms. Calendar's disk which has remained their ever since the night of her murder. Buffy pulls the disk out and hands it to Willow, and pops it into the disk drive to check out its contents. What they find is Jenny's final project: the curse for the restoration of Angel's soul. Meanwhile, Dru, Angel, and several other vamps go to the museum to retrieve the stone, killing Doug Perren in the process.

Rumanian Woods, 1898 - The dead body of a gypsy girl lays stretched out on the ground next to a fire, while an elder gypsy woman chants the curse of restoration. Glowing beneath her is an Orb of Thesulah. While she chants the curse, Angelus flees through the woods, trying to escape the scene of the crime, for he is the one responsible for the girl's death. The elder woman completes the curse, and Angelus is stopped in his tracks. He falls to his knees, and his eyes glow as his soul returns to his body for the first time in over a century. A gypsy man steps out of the woods and explains to Angel that he is being punished for the countless murders he has committed.

Sunnydale, Present - Buffy and Willow show Giles a printout of the restoration curse. Giles claims that the curse would require a great knowledge of the black arts, and Willow feels that she's up to the challenge. While everyone talks of Angel's salvation, only Xander is upset, for he feels that Angel must pay for his murders with his life. Xander gets into an argument with Giles over Jenny's last wish before telling Buffy that she's willing to forget all about the murders in order to get her beloved Angel back. Elsewhere, Angel tells Spike the story of a demon named Acathla. This demon possesses the power to literally swallow the Earth into Hell, but he was stopped by a knight centuries ago. His body turned to stone with the sword still embedded in it, then was concealed in the stone tomb and buried deep beneath the ground. With that, two vampires open the tomb, revealing the body of Acathla inside. Only someone worthy can remove the sword from Acathla's body, freeing him to reign terror on the world. Later that night, Buffy finds the claddagh ring that Angel gave to her before he lost his soul. She goes outside for a walk and encounters Kendra, who has returned to take care of another dark force in Sunnydale. At the library, Kendra shows them a valuable weapon that she brought with her. It is a sword that was blessed by the same knight who stopped Acathla. If Angel succeeds in reviving the demon, it may be their only chance to stop it. Buffy asks Willow to perform the curse as soon as possible, but they need an Orb of Thesulah first. Luckily, Giles already has one in his office.

Manhattan, 1996 - Angel stumbles through the streets of Manhattan, living like a bum ever since he regained his soul. He is approached by another demon named Whistler who says he too is on the good side. Whistler offers Angel a chance to pick himself up from this foul life and become someone important in the world. But first, Angel has to see something before he can make his decision.

Los Angeles, 1996 - A car with windows painted black parks outside of Hemery High, and Angel rolls the window down just enough to see what he came there for: the Chosen One. He observes Buffy's first meeting with a Watcher, then follows her to the cemetery where she first learns the truth about vampires and her destiny in life. Angel also follows Buffy to her home, where her mother is upset because Buffy got home late. Buffy goes to the bathroom and listens to her parents arguing with each other. Having seen enough, Angel asks Whistler to help him to a better life, teach him to become somebody.

Sunnydale, Present - A human sacrifice is brought before Angelus, who promptly feeds on his blood, making sure to spread some on the palm of his right hand. Angelus then approaches the body of Acathla, reciting the incantations for the ritual of his revival. Angelus grabs the sword and pulls it with all his might, but he fails. Spike is amused at Angelus's failure, and Dru is very upset. Angelus then swears that they will turn to an old friend, and then succeed.

The next day, Buffy and the others take one of their final exams, unaware that a concealed vampire is walking down the hallway toward their classroom. The vampire steps into the room, and smoke begins to rise from her body as the rays of sunlight hit it. She warns Buffy that more will die if she does not meet Angel that night. As she finishes the message, her body disintegrates. Buffy tells Willow to perform the curse, leaving Kendra behind to stand guard. Buffy finds Angel at the cemetery, and they begin to fight. Meanwhile, a group of vampires invades the library during the restoration ritual. Back at the cemetery, Buffy realizes that her fight with Angel is merely a diversionary tactic, so she turns and runs towards the school as fast as she can. While Kendra battles one of the vampires, another one pushes a bookshelf over, crushing Willow underneath. Xander fights another one, but it brutally breaks his right arm before he can shake him off. After Kendra slays a vamp, she attacks another that has knocked out Giles. As they surround her, Cordelia escapes from the library, while Willow lays unconscious under the bookshelf. Drusilla then enters and takes on Kendra one-on-one. Kendra is no match for Dru, who defends all of her attacks before hypnotizing the Slayer into an immobile trance. Dru then slashes a cut in Kendra's neck with her nails. Kendra falls to the ground as blood pours out of her neck.

Taking Giles with them, the vampires leave the library only moments before Buffy bursts into the school hallways. She finally makes it to the library, but it is too late. She runs over to Kendra's fallen body, but there's nothing she can do. Suddenly, the police arrive to see Buffy over the body of a dead woman. One of them aims a gun at Buffy, ordering her to freeze. Buffy's disastrous night has just gotten worse... @{"[to be continued...]" LINK "BECOMING2"}

Joss Whedon's two-part season finale is a treat for long-term viewers. It's loaded with continuity references, as well as presenting on screen for the first time events mentioned in previous episodes: Darla turning Angel into a vampire in 1753 Galway (@{"Angel" LINK "ANGEL"}), Angel's mental torture of Drusilla @{"Lie To Me" LINK "LIETOME"}, and Angel being cursed by the gypsies (@{"Angel" LINK "ANGEL"}, @{"Surprise" LINK "SURPRISE"} and @{"Innocence" LINK "INNOCENCE"}). We also get to witness Buffy's tentative first staking, which is an episode highlight, and see Merrick, Buffy's original Watcher, for the first time in the series, (the character was featured in the movie version, where he was played by Donald Sutherland). There's also a real sense of déjà vu about this episode, as elements of @{"Innocence" LINK "INNOCENCE"} and @{"When She Was Bad" LINK "WHENSHEWASBAD"} are brazenly recycled. It must all be rather for confusing for casual viewers!

Buffy's fellow Slayer, Kendra (from @{"What's My Line" LINK "WHATSMYLINE1"}), and Darla (the Master's minion, who was killed in @{"Angel" LINK "ANGEL"}) return, but sadly, neither is given much to do. Bringing Kendra back only to have her killed off, seems rather a waste, particularly as the death of a Slayer could have been the theme of a whole episode.

There's also a new character to complicate things: Whistler (played by Max Perlich, better known as the photographer, Brodie, in 'Homicide - Life on the Street'). Whistler is a meddlesome demon, and it's not clear what his motivations are for becoming involved. This is perhaps intentional - after all, he does say "Nobody understands me, that's my curse!" - but it remains rather perplexing. Writer Joss Whedon seems more than usually preoccupied with plotting, resulting in an episode that lacks his usual vitality.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

This episode presents another date in the Angel chronology, and one that doesn't sit easily with ones mentioned in previous episodes. It's here established that Darla turned the adult Angel into a vampire in 1753. @{"Halloween" LINK "HALLOWEEN"} has him being eighteen years old in 1775, which makes his date of birth around 1756. This episode also contradicts the date that Angel's soul was restored. In @{"Angel" LINK "ANGEL"} it was implied that it happened in the 1920s. Here it's stated as having taken place in Romania, in 1898.

Buffy and Willow find Jenny's computer disc, the one that was misplaced at the end of @{"Passion" LINK "PASSION"}.

If the building for Hemery High, Buffy's previous school, looks familiar, it may be because it was also used as the clock tower in the 'Back To The Future' movies.

Pop culture: Buffy mispronounces Acathla as 'Alfalfa', the name of a cheeky child character from Hal Roach's long-running series of 'Our Gang' movies, (they began in 1922, and ended in 1944). The Alfalfa character, played by Carl Switzer, appeared in the series from 1935 to 1942. In 1955 the series was re-titled, for legal reasons, to 'The Little Rascals', and sold to American television, where it has remained a popular staple ever since.

5V22

Follows on from @{"Becoming - Part One" LINK "BECOMING1"}.

Two police officers rush into the library. From the looks of things, they believe that Buffy has just murdered Kendra. They take her outside, where Principal Snyder arrives with several more cops. Before one of them can cuff her, Buffy knocks the guy down and flees the scene. After disguising herself in a coat and black cap, Buffy goes to the hospital and runs into Xander, who is now wearing a cast on his right forearm. They go to Willow's room, where she lies motionless in a coma. Cordelia arrives, and Buffy learns that Giles was neither with her or in the hospital. Giles has been taken to the vampire's mansion hideout, where Angel hopes to force the necessary info concerning the ritual out of the Watcher. Meanwhile, Joyce learns from the police that her daughter is suspected of murder and that she's a fugitive from the law. Buffy goes to Giles apartment to see if he's there, but instead meets Whistler, who has been waiting inside. He tells Buffy that Angel was destined to stop Acathla, not revive him. However, Buffy's relationship with Angel changed all that. Buffy leaves before Whistler can tell her how to stop the demon. Outside, a patrolling officer recognizes Buffy and orders her to freeze. Suddenly, Spike arrives and beats the cop into unconsciousness. He wants Buffy's help in stopping Angel so he can have Drusilla back the way she used to be, in exchange for his leaving town with Dru and never returning. After some hesitation, Buffy decides to take him back to her house so they can plan their attack. They get there just as Joyce is pulling into their driveway. As Buffy tries to make up an excuse for Spike's presence, a vampire that has been spying on them attacks. Right in front of Joyce's eyes, Buffy stakes the vampire spy, turning him to dust. Realizing what she has to do, Buffy confesses to her mother that she is a vampire slayer.

At the hospital, Xander pleads to Willow for her to wake up. She finally snaps out of her coma just as Xander says that he loves her. The first word out of her mouth is Oz's name, who arrives to greet her back to consciousness. Meanwhile, Giles refuses to divulge the information that Angel needs to properly perform the ritual, so more torture ensues. Back at the Summers home, Buffy and Spike agree to work together, but only on the conditions that Dru can leave with Spike, and that Giles survives. After Spike leaves, Joyce begs her daughter to explain everything that's going on. Buffy tells her mom that there's no time to explain it all, which furiates Joyce. Joyce doesn't want her daughter to be in charge of saving the world, to which Buffy responds that she never wanted the duty in the first place. Joyce tries to restrain her daughter from leaving the house, but Buffy pushes her back against the kitchen counter. Joyce tells Buffy to never come back should she walk out the door, but Buffy leaves anyways.

At the hospital, Willow tells the others that she is going to try the curse again. Buffy returns to the library to retrieve the sword that Kendra brought. Principal Snyder finds her there and promptly expels her due to all the trouble she's been involved in. After Buffy leaves, Snyder calls someone to tell the Mayor that he has good news. Meanwhile, Drusilla tricks Giles by making herself look and sound like Jenny Calendar in his eyes. Giles says that Angel's blood is the key to the awakening ritual. Homeless and expelled, Buffy has only one path to follow now. She returns to Giles apartment and asks Whistler how to use the sword. He tells her that only Angel's blood can open and close the vortex to Hell. With one blow, both Angelus and the demon Acathla would be sent back to Hell, and the vortex would be closed.

Xander catches up with Buffy on her way to the mansion. She tells him to concentrate on freeing Giles and escaping. Xander does not inform Buffy that Willow is attempting the curse again. Inside the mansion, Angel slices his hand and approaches the sword in Acathla's chest. Suddenly, the ritual is interrupted by Buffy's arrival. Angel doesn't even notice Spike rising out of his wheelchair from behind. While Spike brutally beats Angel to the floor, Buffy takes one of the other vampires in the room. During this battle, Xander unties Giles and gets him safely outside. Spike doesn't get too many hits off before an enraged Drusilla jumps into the fray, tackling Spike. While they fight, Angel manages to get back up and run to Acathla. Just as Buffy drives a stake through the vampire's heart, Angel grabs the sword with his bloody hand and finally pulls it out. Swords in hand, Buffy and Angel engage in a sword duel. Elsewhere, Willow, Cordy, and Oz perform the curse of restoration. Suddenly, Willow loses control of her actions and seemingly becomes possessed by some spirit. Cordy and Oz watch in fright as Willow performs the curse herself in perfect Latin. Spike subdues Drusilla and takes her with him as he escapes from the mansion in his car. After the long duel, Buffy finally backs Angel up against Acathla.

Just as she is about to deliver the final blow, Willow completes the curse, restoring Angel's soul to his body. Buffy lowers her sword as she realizes the change, and the two lovers are finally reunited. However, it is too late, for Acathla is now awake. Buffy looks over Angel's shoulder and sees Acathla's mouth creating a vortex to Hell. Angel has no idea what is going on, so all that Buffy can do is give her lover one last kiss before driving the sword through his stomach, thus releasing the blood needed to close the vortex and send the two demons back to Hell. Shocked, Angel reaches out towards Buffy with his right hand, but nothing can be done now. Buffy watches as the vortex closes around Angel, leaving the demon Acathla as nothing more than a silent statue once again.

Buffy goes home and packs up her belongings without Joyce ever knowing she had returned. When Joyce enters the room, she finds a farewell letter from her daughter left on the bed. At Sunnydale High, nobody knows what happened to Buffy and Angel. Some believe that Buffy had to kill Angel before the curse was completed, while others believe that Angel has been restored and they were taking time off to be alone together. Unbeknownst to them, Buffy is standing far away by one of the trees, giving her school and her friends one last look before hopping on a bus. The bus heads out of Sunnydale, and Buffy faces an unknown future.

Joss Whedon shepherds his story back on course. As usual he takes some pleasure in creating havoc for his characters, and in doing so creates another pivotal episode. There doesn't seem to be any good reason why Spike and Drusilla should be written out, especially as they've become heavily integrated into most storylines since Angel became evil again.

There must be plenty of mileage left in their characters. Juliet Landau (Drusilla) has been a constant delight in every scene she's been in. James Marsters, although rather short-changed by being stuck in a wheelchair for most of the season, has been a brooding presence that's helped maintain the crucial balance between the day-to-day antics of the Scooby gang and the show's darker elements.

After the multifarious delights of the last episode, (most notably all the flashbacks depicting events we'd only previously heard about), this episode seemed a little dull. More interesting than the routine plotting, the highlight of the episode was the beautifully written and acted scene where Buffy revealed the truth to her mother: "What do you think has been going on for the past two years? The fights, the weird occurrences  How many times have you washed blood out of my clothing, and you still haven't figured it out?"

As a season cliffhanger 'Becoming - Part 2' is not nearly as thrilling as @{"Prophecy Girl" LINK "PROPHECYGIRL"}, but it has taken the show and given it a thorough shaking. Or, as Spike so eloquently puts it:

"Goodbye Piccadilly, farewell Leicester bloody Square!"

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Some sources have the title of this episode as 'The Whistler', but this doesn't seem to be officially sanctioned.

Xander finally confesses his love to Willow in this episode, and this key phrase is perhaps what wakes her from her coma. Unfortunately for Xander, the first name she calls out for is Oz.

A couple of times this season we've seen vampires driving around town in cars with blacked out windows, (Angel's arrival in Sunnydale in @{"Becoming - Part 1" LINK "BECOMING1"}, and Spike and Drusilla's departure in this episode). If this idea tickles your fancy, then find yourself a copy of Kathryn Bigelow's funky 1987 movie 'Near Dark', a thoughtful look at what it might be like to be a modern-day vampire.

Joyce and Spike are reacquainted, after their brief encounter in @{"School Hard" LINK "SCHOOLHARD"}. Of course, Joyce has only a vague recollection of their meeting, due to Sunnydale's usual wave of collective amnesia.

@{b}Chris's Notes@{ub}

The Mutant Enemy monster shown at the end of each episode of Buffy usually groans as he wobbles past. This time he "needs a hug" - probably a bizarre reference to the sniffle-worthy end of the season.

The double episode is named 'Becoming' after Angel's speech: "I wanna become someone."

@{b}Anne@{ub}
3ABB01

Sunnydale Cemetery. Evening. A body once known as Andrew Hoelich rises from its grave, ready for a new life as a creature of the night. Standing in his way is not the Slayer, but rather her closest friends: Willow, Xander, and Oz. Unfortunately, without the powers that make Buffy special, the three friends are unable to kill the vampire before it can escape into the night. Afterwards, the group prepares themselves for the new school season, which begins the very next day. They also wonder if and when Buffy will return to Sunnydale after her unannounced absence since saving the world from the Acathla threat. What they don't know is that Buffy is currently living alone in an apartment in downtown Los Angeles. Buffy's dreams are haunted by Angel, reminding of her of what she had to do in order to stop Acathla.

The next morning, Willow learns that Oz flunked his senior year and needs to repeat it, Xander and Cordelia's anticipated reunion has no sparks whatsoever, and Giles gets the latest in a long line of leads concerning Buffy's possible location. Meanwhile, Buffy is working as a waitress in a diner, under the alias of Anne. During work, she serves a romantic couple of runaways. The girl's name is Lily, while the guy's is Rickie. They both have each other's name tattooed to their forearms. When Lily recognizes the waitress, Buffy denies any familiarity with the girl. At one point, Rickie says to Lily the exact same words that Buffy heard from Angel in one of her dreams. The next day, on the way to work, Buffy passes by an old homeless woman who repeatedly says, "I'm no one." Back in Sunnydale, Giles pays Joyce Summers a visit to inform her that his latest search turned up empty-handed. Joyce expresses her resentment toward Giles, blaming him for Buffy's distance from her own mother.

On her way home from work, Buffy runs into Lily again. Lily gets Buffy's attention by calling her by her real name, then reminds Buffy that she once went by the name of Chantarelle and was involved in a vampire-worshipping cult. Buffy explains that Anne is really her middle name. During their conversation, an old man rudely bumps the both of them aside as he walks towards the street. When asked if he's okay, the old man turns to them and says, "I'm no one." With that, he walks into the middle of the street, then stops in the path of an oncoming car. Buffy dashes into the street and pushes him aside just in time, but not before the car collides and sends her slamming into the pavement. A few locals offer to help her and call an ambulance, but Buffy quickly leaves the scene without even a limp. On the way, Buffy meets a relatively clean-cut man. His name is Ken, and he's handing out flyers for a shelter called the Family Home. Meanwhile, in the Bronze, Xander chats with Willow and Oz about their failure at vampire slaying. Seeing Cordelia enter the Bronze with a few of her friends, Xander hatches a plan to use her as bait.

The next day, Lily visits Buffy at work and tells her that Rickie's been missing for a while. Buffy reluctantly agrees to help, and they first visit the local blood bank where Lily and Rickie often donated in order to make some money. According to the doctor, Rickie hasn't been there in the last few days, so Buffy and Lily agree to split up and meet up later at Buffy's apartment. During a search in an abandoned building, Buffy finds a dead old man with a bottle of Drain Cleaner next to his head. Since the bottle is empty, the old man must have killed himself with it. However, that's not the most disturbing thing: Buffy notices a familiar tattoo on the man's forearm. It says "Lily", which means that this dead old man was Rickie. Back at her apartment, Lily cannot believe the news. She blames Buffy for bringing along some evil from Sunnydale, causing her boyfriend's untimely death. Lily exits the apartment and meets Ken, who tells her that Rickie is alive and staying at the Family Home. Relieved, Lily follows Ken to the shelter. Determined to get to the bottom of things, Buffy breaks into the blood bank after closing hours and finds Rickie's personal file. Alarmed by the word "Candidate" stamped in it, Buffy questions the doctor, who has just arrived on the scene. Buffy gets the info that leads her to the Family Home, where she finds Lily alone with Ken in a room. Before Buffy can find out what's going on, Lily is pulled into the floor through a strange black pool. Buffy struggles with Ken before they both fall into the pool. On the other side of it, they crash down hard on the floor. While Buffy takes care of Lily, Ken removes his mask to reveal the face of a demon underneath. He calls the guards, and Buffy grabs Lily and tries to escape. As the guards give chase, Buffy and Lily run into an enormous factory room. Hundreds of missing runaways work slave labor, while the demonic guards watch them, whips in hand. Ken and the guards catch up to them. With a swift swing of his club, Ken knocks Buffy unconscious.

Back in Sunnydale, Xander, Willow, and Oz try to dust the vampire again, this time with Cordelia as bait. While everyone assumes their hiding positions, Xander and Cordelia argue over what they did or didn't do during the summer. Their fight is interrupted by a scream, for the vamp has snuck up behind Willow and attacked her first. Oz runs in to the rescue, but the vamp quickly knocks him to the ground. Xander tries to drive his stake into the vampire's chest, but they get their arms locked up, preventing Xander from thrusting the stake any further. Cordelia charges the vampire from behind, and all three of them fall to the ground. The vampire lands into the stake, and immediately explodes into dust. This causes Cordelia to fall into Xander's arms. They finally give in to their desires and kiss right then and there.

Buffy regains consciousness inside a prison cell. Lily, who's sitting inside the same cell, believes they're in Hell. Buffy denies this, but that becomes irrelevant as Ken explains their situation. Apparently, they are in some alternate dimension outside of Earth, and time passes differently here. According to Ken, one day on Earth equals one hundred years in this dimension. Buffy puts the pieces together and realizes that the disoriented old people she saw on the street must have been former slaves in this dimension, including Rickie. Buffy, Lily, and several other runaways are then led into a room. A demon guard tells them that they no longer have any individual identities. He then asks a boy to identify himself. When the boy responds with his own name, the guard beats him with a club. Lily's next, and her answer is "no one". A few more slaves respond in the same manner. The guard then asks Buffy. Instead of giving the expected answer, Buffy finally comes to terms with who she is and responds with her true identity, that of the Slayer. With that, Buffy proceeds to fight and subdue the guards in the room. After telling Lily to lead the others to the exit, Buffy runs out into the middle of the factory and battles an endless number of demon guards. One after the other, Buffy defeats them, until Ken grabs Lily and threatens to slice her throat with a knife for Buffy's disobedience. Surprisingly, Lily pushes Ken off the balcony while his back is turned, enabling Buffy to fight off the guards holding her and climb to safety. At the exit, they encounter a heavy gate which Buffy uses all of her strength to lift. Just as she's about to escape herself, Ken tackles her. As he does so, Buffy is knocked towards the outside of the gate, which comes crashing down on Ken's legs. Buffy then takes Ken's club and smashes it onto his skull. After Buffy, Lily, and the other runaways climb through the black pool, it seals itself.

Deciding it's time to go back home, Buffy gives her apartment and her job to Lily. Buffy is confident that Lily can take care of herself from now on. Before Buffy leaves, Lily asks her if she can use Buffy's middle name, Anne, as her own. Buffy agrees and leaves. Back in Sunnydale, Buffy knocks on the door to her home. After Joyce opens it, they stand there, completely speechless. Finally, they embrace. For Giles and the rest of the Sunnydale, the Slayer has returned. For Joyce Summers, someone more important is finally home: her only daughter.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

If season two started with an episode that made it seem like the programme had been completely revitalised by the break, then the third season begins with an episode still deeply rooted in the somewhat depressing finale to the previous episode. More than five months have passed between the climactic end of @{"Becoming - Part Two" LINK "BECOMING2"} and our return to Sunnydale in 'Anne', and the stagnation caused by Buffy's departure is acutely felt. Willow, Oz and Xander seem woefully ill- equipped to tackle the town's vampire population and must have been lucky to survive the summer break!

For some time it feels like Joss has completely forgotten how the series works. Buffy's self-imposed exile has upset the careful balance that usually exists within the team. What's more, Cordelia's awkward reintroduction after her Mexican holiday artificially distances her from the rest of the gang. It creates another impediment to returning to the status quo.

One element of the episode that does work very well is the gradual shift in Buffy's spirits. We first encounter her working anonymously in a diner, her mental scars far from healed. Her reawakening is gradual, spurred on by her empathy for the waifs and strays sleeping rough on the streets of the city. Between Sarah's acting, and Joss's script and direction it's beautifully depicted. Her eventual realisation that she must return to Sunnydale ends the general atmosphere of malaise. If there was any doubt that the show was veering off the rails, it is dispelled by Buffy's defiant message: "I'm Buffy. The Vampire Slayer, and you are?!"

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

The new season sports a new, updated title sequence, and a slightly different arrangement of Nerf Herder's theme music. The final shot of the new sequence, a moody close-up of Buffy holding a sickle-like axe, comes from this episode. The new titles include credit for Seth Green, who is promoted to a regular cast member from this episode.

Several cast members featured in previous episodes return here, including Larry Bagby III as Larry, (the jock that Xander outed in @{"Phases" LINK "PHASES"}. Also notable is the return of Chanterelle, the vampire wannabe from @{"Lie To Me" LINK "LIETOME"}, here reincarnated as 'Lily'.

Ken is played by Carlos Jacott, who has also appeared in the hit TV sitcom 'Frasier' as Matt, the producer of a morning TV show that Frasier presents for a week. Confusingly, he later appears in an episode of 'Angel' as a completely different demon.

We discover that Buffy's middle name is Anne, a fact curiously omitted from her tombstone, which appeared in @{"Nightmares" LINK "NIGHTMARES"}.

@{b}Dead Man's Party@{ub}
3ABB02

After unpacking the last of her belongings, Buffy stops by her mom's bedroom to announce that she's heading outside. Joyce hangs up a Nigerian mask that she got from a friend at her art gallery, then hesitantly gives her daughter permission to go find her friends. Later, in a dark alley, Buffy notices a shadowy figure roaming the alleys.

Suspicious, she follows him and accidentally draws his attention by stepping on an aluminum can. The figure spins around and thrusts a stake at her, which Buffy easily blocks. As she grabs the stake out of the man's hands and turns it towards him, she realizes that it's Xander. Before either of them can say much, a vampire appears and attacks the both of them. During the struggle, Buffy hears Cordelia's voice on a walkie- talkie attached to Xander's waist. Soon enough, Cordy, Willow, and Oz arrive on the scene, all decked out with stakes and crosses. Buffy is surprised to see her friends work as a team to get the vampire off of Buffy. One by one, though, they are knocked to the ground by the powerful vampire. Finally, Buffy jumps in and finishes the job, reducing the vampire to a pile of dust. After Buffy greets her bewildered friends, they head over to Giles' apartment. The Watcher is emotionally overcome with joy from seeing his Slayer safe and sound, although he doesn't fully express it until he's alone in his kitchen. In the living room, Buffy avoids discussion topics relating to what she did over the summer. She then makes plans with Willow to meet somewhere the next afternoon.

The next day, Joyce and Buffy visit Principal Snyder in his office. Despite Joyce's protests, Snyder refuses to readmit Buffy back into the school. Afterwards, Joyce drops Buffy off at a coffee shop where she plans to meet Willow. However, Willow never shows up. Buffy heads home, and as she heads towards her front door, a woman steps out. She introduces herself as Pat, a friend of Joyce's at the book club. Inside, Joyce tells Buffy that she invited Giles and her friends over to dinner the following evening. Buffy goes into the basement to get their fancy company plates. There, she finds a stray cat that has been dead for a while. Buffy and Joyce bury it outside. Later that night, after both Buffy and Joyce have fallen asleep, the eyeholes of the mask in Joyce's bedroom begin to glow. As they do so, the stray cat works its way out of the ground as if it had never died.

Overnight, Buffy dreams that she is walking around the Sunnydale High campus. Nobody else is there, except for Angel. She then wakes up and heads to the kitchen. The stray cat reenters the Summers home, shocking both Buffy and Joyce. Giles arrives shortly with a cage to capture the cat and bring it back to the library for further study. After finding the cat in Joyce's bedroom, he notices the Nigerian mask on her wall. He then informs Buffy that she is no longer allowed on school grounds. At the library, Giles studies his demonology text while the rest of the Slayerettes make plans for the dinner that evening. By the end of their discussion, the intimate dinner has become a full-blown party, complete with pot luck snacks and Oz's band. During the discussion, Giles careless flips past a page without looking at it. On this page is a picture of the same mask hanging in Joyce's bedroom.

That evening, Pat comes over to visit Joyce. Merely moments after Buffy shuts the door, Oz's band, Dingoes Ate My Baby, arrives. Buffy was not notified in advance that they had planned a huge party, but that's exactly what she gets before long. After wading through dozens of people she's never even met before, Buffy finds Willow near the band. Buffy pulls her over to a quieter area and asks Willow if she's been avoiding her. Willow denies this, then immediately leaves Buffy alone and heads back to where the band is playing. On her way upstairs, Buffy briefly talks to Xander and Cordelia, who are lost in their own world of nonstop smoochies. Buffy then stops outside the kitchen, where Joyce and Pat are talking about having Buffy back home. Buffy overhears her mom talking about how much more difficult it is now that Buffy's home. Unable to take much more animosity from her closest friends and family, Buffy goes up to her bedroom and starts packing her bag again. Meanwhile, Giles finally finds what he's been looking for in his texts: the picture of the Nigerian mask. Horrified by what he reads, he calls the Summers home, but one of the partygoers answers the phone, and the music is too loud for him to fully understand what Giles is saying. Giles gives up and drives towards Buffy's home. On the way, he accidentally hits a man in the middle of the road. Upon getting out and inspecting the body, Giles realizes that this man died long before he ever wandered onto the road. The corpse grabs Giles and shoves him against the car. Giles watches in horror as he sees several more zombies appearing from the shadows. All over town, corpses arise from crime scenes, hospital beds, and even their graves, all with one destination in mind: the Summers household. Giles finally fends off the zombies and gets back in his car, but is forced to hotwire it when he realises he's dropped his keys outside.

Willow finds Buffy packing her bag in her bedroom. Not long after they argue over Buffy's decision to run away, Joyce enters the bedroom. Her reaction to seeing Buffy's packed bag is much more heated. Buffy tries to get out of the house, but Joyce stops her right in the middle of the main floor. As everybody gathers around and watches, Joyce drops all her restraints and angrily chews out Buffy for what she did (and didn't do) over the summer. Buffy tries to defend herself, but Xander joins in and offers his own cold remarks. Just as it seems that everybody is against Buffy and her whole world is caving in, the zombies invade the household. They quickly and brutally attack and kill several of the guests, while everybody else runs for their lives. Many try to keep the doors and windows blocked off, while others just panic in general. One of the zombies grabs Pat and drags her off down a hallway. While Buffy, Joyce, Xander, and Willow run upstairs, Oz and Cordelia hide in a downstairs closet. Upstairs, Joyce finds Pat lying flat on the floor. They help her to her feet and into Joyce's bedroom. While the group tries to keep the zombies from forcing the door open, Willow checks Pat's pulse and realizes that she's already dead.

Several moments later, Oz and Cordelia step out of the closet and notice that all of the zombies are now upstairs. They run into Giles, who has just arrived. He explains that the mask contains the power of the zombie demon named Ovu Mobani, or Evil Eye. All the zombies are after it, and whoever puts it on will become the demon. Upstairs, nobody notices Pat as she suddenly gets up. Surprised to see that her friend is alive, Joyce runs over, only to be knocked to the floor by the zombie Pat. As Joyce and Xander look on, Pat puts the mask on, which immediately molds to her face. Pat begins to speak, except it isn't her voice anymore. It is the voice of the demon Ovu Mobani, and the zombies that were previously trying to get into the room are now paralyzed with fear by Mobani's presence. Buffy tries to attack the demon, but it turns its head and flashes a brilliantly white light which stuns Buffy. Unable to move, Buffy takes the powerful blow of the demon hard. The demon then stuns Willow and moves in for the kill, but not before Buffy recovers and pushes Mobani through the second story window, along with herself. After they crash onto her backyard, Buffy tries to avoid the demon's gaze by covering her eyes. Giles tells Oz to warn Buffy that attacking its eyes is the only way to defeat Mobani. Oz runs out and immediately falls victim to Mobani's stun flash. Buffy uses this moment to her advantage and thrusts a shovel directly into the demon's eyes. It cries out in horror, then vanishes, along with all of the other zombies. After everybody regroups inside, nobody can bring themselves to spite Buffy any longer, as she finally embraces Willow after so long.

The next day, Giles visits Principal Snyder's office and threatens to contact state officials if Buffy isn't readmitted. When Snyder doesn't believe his threat, Giles applies a little brute force to get his message across. Later, Buffy and Willow meet at the coffee shop. Willow discusses her experiments with witchcraft. They understand what each other has been feeling during the past few months, and like the true friends that they are, accept it.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

If you were to ask a casual viewer to sum up the plot of this episode no doubt they'd focus on the Ovu Mobani mask and the zombies that gatecrash Buffy's welcome home party. But, as is often the case with BtVS, appearances can be deceptive and this episode has perhaps the most superficial veneer of any to date.

The first clue as to what lies at the heart of Dead Man's Party is that the action follows straight on from the end of the previous episode, @{"Anne" LINK "ANNE"}, with Buffy unpacking her clothes after returning home. Dead Man's Party deals primarily with Buffy's reintegration into Sunnydale life and healing the rifts caused by her time away. Marti Noxon wisely concentrates on making the viewers empathise with Buffy's disorientating feelings of alienation. The zombies are a distraction; a lazy sop to viewers expecting a fix of thrills and spills.

This is really a "taking care of business" episode that ties up most of the loose ends left over at the end of Season Two, notably the problem of how to get Buffy back into school. It presents the perfect excuse to reintroduce Snyder, who appears in a couple of nice scenes and is the target of a few choice barbs even when he's not on screen.

@{b}Trivia @{ub}

The name of the demon, Ovu Mobani, is Nigerian for "Evil Eye". It's not entirely clear in the finished episode, but the demon was supposed to have the power to paralyse his victims with a flash from his eyes.

The episode's title, Dead Man's Party is perhaps a reference to the 1985 Oingo Boingo song, which can be found on their album of the same name.

Listen carefully to catch another sign of Giles' misspent youth: when he hotwires his car after losing the keys in a scuffle with the zombies, he mutters "like riding a bloody bicycle!"

@node "FAITHHOPETRICK" "Buffy.guide: Faith, Hope & Trick"

@{b}Faith, Hope & Trick@{ub}
3ABB03

A limo pulls into the drive-thru at Sunnydale's Happy Burger restaurant. Inside the limo are not your ordinary customers, but rather vampires in search of the Slayer. One of them has cloven hooves in place of hands. On the way to their new hideout, one the vamps, Mr. Trick, picks up a diet soda... and the drive-thru employee himself. Later that night, Buffy dreams that she is dancing with Angel in the Bronze. During their dance, Buffy's claddagh ring slips off her finger and falls to the floor. Angel picks it up and clutches it in his hand, so tightly that blood starts to pour from his fist. As Buffy watches in horror, more blood seeps from Angel's chest in the exact same spot that she drive the sword through months ago.

The next morning, Principal Snyder finally re-admits Buffy into Sunnydale High, due to orders from the school board itself. Buffy needs to follow a few conditions, one of which being her ability to pass make-up exams for all the classes she missed last school year. A student again, Buffy visits the library with Willow, where they find a variety of spell ingredients on the counter. Giles tells Buffy that he needs to perform a binding spell on Acathla to make sure the demon remains dormant. In order for the spell to work, Giles needs to know the exact details of how Buffy defeated Acathla and Angel. Buffy lays out the basics, leaving out the part where Angel's soul was restored. Later that night at the Bronze, Buffy turns down a dance offer from Scott Hope, a fellow student who's had his eyes on Buffy for a while. Cordelia points out an interesting couple on the dance floor. As Buffy watches them dance, she begins to suspect that the guy may be a vampire on the prowl. As they head out of the Bronze, Buffy and her friends follow them out. Sure enough, the guy is a vampire. What does take the group by surprise is the girl's handling of the situation. Instead of screaming and trying to run for her life, the girl proceeds to beat the crap out of the vampire, stopping momentarily to greet Buffy by name and introduce herself as Faith. This new Slayer then takes the stake out of Buffy's hand and finishes off the vamp before heading back inside. While the group listens to Faith's wild stories, Cordelia finally puts the pieces together and realizes that Faith was called forth in response to Kendra's death. Faith is unlike Buffy, but she's different than Kendra also. Kendra was always uptight and on the defensive, while Faith is much looser and a little wild. During their conversation, Faith informs Buffy that her Watcher is currently at an annual retreat.

Unaware of this Watchers' retreat, Buffy takes Faith to the library to meet Giles, who apparently has never been invited to any of the retreats. Buffy invites Faith to dinner at her place. While Buffy takes one of her make-up exams, Xander and Willow give Faith a tour of their school, pointing out all the hot spots where they brushed with death. Elsewhere, in an abandoned building, Mr. Trick explains to Kakistos how they could stay in Sunnydale and still operate around the globe, thanks to the internet. Kakistos has no interest in these matters. His only goal is to kill Faith, who caused the huge scar running over his right eye.

At the Summers home, Joyce is as impressed with Faith as the rest of Buffy's friends are, if not more so. Buffy excuses herself from the dining table to talk with her mom in the kitchen. Joyce suggests to Buffy that Faith could take over her duties as the Slayer, but Buffy reminds her that it's her job until she dies. Joyce is not happy to hear this, but she's slowly learning to accept it. After dinner, Buffy and Faith patrol for vampires. During their patrol, they get into an argument over Buffy's attitude towards Faith and the apparent fact that she's holding something in. Suddenly, several vampires attack the two Slayers. During the fight, Faith loses control on one vampire and repeatedly pummels it without even thinking of finishing the job with a stake. This leaves Buffy at the mercy of the other two vampires, who have her pinned to the ground. As one of them moves in for the kill, he mentions a name: Kakistos. Buffy succeeds in breaking their hold and killing one of them, while the other gets away. She then pulls Faith off of the brutally beaten vampire and dusts it with her stake. It seems Buffy isn't the only one with personal problems.

Buffy tells Giles about Faith's actions the next morning at school. She also tells Giles what the vampire said to her, and Giles immediately recognizes the name Kakistos. It's Greek for "the worst of the worst". Kakistos is a vampire who is so old that his hands have turned into cloven hooves. While Giles gets on the phone to contact Faith's Watcher at the retreat, Buffy runs into Scott in the hallway. He makes one last stab at trying to get Buffy out on a date. Charmed by his efforts, Buffy finally accepts. Scott then hands Buffy a box, saying it's a gift to represent their friendship. Buffy opens it and finds a claddagh ring inside, exactly like the one Angel gave to her that night on the docks. Overcome with emotion, Buffy drops the ring. As it hits the floor in the exact same fashion that it did in her dream, Buffy backs out of her date with Scott. Giles arrives and tries to help her, but Buffy insists she's okay. Giles then reveals that Faith's Watcher is not at the retreat - Faith's Watcher is dead.

Buffy tracks down Faith to a sleazy motel. Buffy informs her that Kakistos is in town, which causes a look of fear and dread to wash over Faith's face. She immediately starts packing and starts to head out. Buffy stops her by mentioning her Watcher, who was killed by Kakistos. They hear a knock on the door, and Faith opens it. They are greeted by Kakistos, Mr. Trick, and a few of their cohort vampires. Buffy shuts the door and escapes out the back with Faith. The vampires chase them into a building. Seemingly safe for now, Faith explains that she witnessed Kakistos murdering her Watcher. Just then, Faith notices a couple of dead bodies on the floor. Buffy realizes that they didn't escape the vampires, but were instead driven into the building on purpose. As the vampires start to converge on them, Buffy and Faith run into the middle of the floor. Buffy takes on several vampires while Faith goes one-on-one with Kakistos. Paralyzed with fear, Faith can't fight back while Kakistos grabs her by the neck and repeatedly strikes her in the face. Buffy runs over to help, while Mr. Trick and a female vampire decide to abandon their master and head out into town on their own. Kakistos' body is so strong that Buffy's stake has no effect on him. Faith takes a cue from Kakistos' mockery and picks up a huge pointed beam. Before Kakistos can realize what she's doing, Faith drives it straight through his heart, causing Kakistos to crumble into dust.

The next day, the Watcher's council approves Giles' request to watch over both Buffy and Faith until a new Watcher can be assigned to her. Unable to keep her secret any longer, Buffy tells Giles and Willow the whole truth about what happened that night in the mansion. She explains that Willow's attempt at the restoration spell worked, and Angel was cured before Buffy drove the sword through him and sent him to Hell. After she heads out, Giles tells Willow that there never was a binding spell to perform on Acathla. He made the whole thing up so that Buffy would finally vent out whatever's been eating at her from the inside all this time. In the hallway, Buffy finds Scott and revives their plans for their weekend date.

Later that night, Buffy revisits the mansion where Angel, Spike, and Dru once stayed. Back at the scene where Buffy kissed Angel for the last time, she places the claddagh ring on the floor and bids her final farewell to Angel. After she leaves, the floor of the mansion begins to rumble. A bright light appears in the air, and the naked body of a man falls out from it and onto the floor. He lies there, afraid and shivering. It's Angel, who has returned from Hell... somehow.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

The first couple of episodes of this season were mainly concerned with tidying up after Buffy and Angel's climactic battle, a lot of time was spent getting things back to normal. 'Faith, Hope and Trick' injects new energy into the show, restores the status quo and then spins things off in an entirely new direction.

David Greenwalt's script perfectly balances the elements jostling for space: it advances the relationships of the key characters, introduces two important new characters, (mercenary vampire Mister Trick and the deliciously kinky Faith), and manages to throw in a couple of thrilling action scenes for good measure.

Even though we're told very little about Trick at this stage, there's a lot of information to absorb about "the new slayer in town". Even at this stage it's clear that Faith is a very volatile presence, something that's sorely needed to add zest to a show beginning to exhibit signs of running out of steam.

It's a busy episode for Buffy, who restores her relationship with Giles (by admitting that Angel had been cured when she slew him); admits to her mother that she died during her confrontation with The Master (in @{"Prophecy Girl" LINK "ProphecyGirl"}); and has finally let go of Angel... or so she thinks!

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

One of Joss Whedon's ideas for the series is that the older a vampire gets, the more animalistic they become. Two vampires that Buffy has encountered have exhibited signs of this: The Master, whose features were bat-like, and Kakistos, who has cloven feet and hands. It's also worth remembering that traditionally the Devil has been depicted with cloven feet, indeed, he's often goat-like from the waist down.

A third semi-regular character is introduced in this episode: Buffy's new squeeze Scott Hope (Fab Fillipo).

Pop Culture 1: the reference "Makes D.C. look like Mayberry" refers to the setting of the popular CBS TV series 'The Andy Griffith Show' (a.k.a. 'Andy of Mayberry'). It featured the adventures of a small-town Sheriff, and ran from 1960-68 before it's star departed and the show was renamed 'Mayberry RFD'.

Pop Culture 2: Buffy's complaint "I'm the one getting Single White Femaled here" is a reference to the 1992 movie 'Single White Female', which starred Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridget Fonda as flatmates. In the film Leigh's character begins to psychotically copy every aspect of Fonda's life.

3ABB04

It's Oz's time of the month, which means he has to spend three consecutive nights locked in the book cage of the library while someone watches over him. After Xander comes in to relieve Willow of her post, he lies down on the table and falls asleep. At the cemetery, Buffy patrols for vampires with Faith. Neither of them are close enough to the woods to detect a chase, which ends brutally for a boy named Jeff Orkin.

The next morning, Buffy, Willow, and Oz meet up with Scott and two of his friends: Pete and Debbie. Oz offers his old biology notes to Debbie, so they plan to meet up later. Buffy then heads off for her required therapy appointment with the counselor while Willow and Oz go to the library. To both Oz and Willow's dismay, Giles and Xander inform them of the murder that occurred the previous night. The fact that Xander slept through most of the night and the window inside the caged area is open does not bode well for Oz.

Meanwhile, Buffy meets her counselor, Mr. Platt. While she's hesitant to discuss the full details of her reasons for running away, Buffy does come to respect Mr. Platt's helpful manner. After school, Buffy meets the others in the library and learns that Oz may have killed someone while he was a werewolf. Giles tells Willow, Xander, and Cordelia to go to the morgue and inspect Jeff's corpse, while Buffy must be on the look-out for the killer if it isn't Oz. He'll have Faith watch over Oz that night. At the morgue, Willow collects evidence which clearly indicates that Jeff was mauled by a savage animal. She then passes out due to the realization that Oz is the most likely suspect. Outside, Buffy encounters someone running wild through the woods. To her surprise, that someone is Angel.

However, he's not exactly in his right mind, and he immediately attacks Buffy. They fight for a while before Buffy finally knocks him out. She then takes him to Spike and Dru's mansion, where she uses some of Dru's old chains to lock Angel up and keep him from escaping out into the woods. Unable to communicate with Angel, Buffy notices the burnt pattern on the floor that indicates the spot where Angel landed at the end of his return trip from Hell. Unable to spend the rest of the night at home, Buffy goes to the library and takes over for Faith.

Giles finds Buffy asleep in one of the library chairs the next morning. He notices the books she's been reading, which deal with demon dimensions and Acathla. After Buffy wakes up, she asks Giles if Angel could ever return from Hell, and if so, what would he be like. Buffy would rather not tell Giles right away that she found Angel. While Giles doubts the possibilty of Angel's return, he goes on to say that because time moves much faster in the other dimension, Angel would have been trapped there for an incredibly long time. After so many years of torture, he couldn't possibly be the same person mentally that he once was. Later, at lunchtime, Buffy joins Scott, Pete, and Debbie at their table. Unable to straighten out her feelings, Buffy leaves shortly and goes to the mansion. As soon as she rests a hand on Angel's shoulder, he goes berserk. Shaken by how much he's changed, Buffy heads back to Sunnydale High. Inside, Buffy goes to Mr. Platt's office and confesses that she truly needs help with all that's going on in her life. Unfortunately, she won't get any help from Mr. Platt, whom she soon discovers has been murdered, most likely by the same attacker that killed Jeff Orkin.

After school, Pete pulls Debbie into the maintenance room to make out for a while. Inside, he notices that a jar once containing a glowing green formula is now virtually empty. Debbie tries to deny doing anything with it, but she soon admits that she got rid of it in order to help Pete get better. However, Pete convulses and transforms into a hideous, monstrous form of himself, proving to Debbie that he doesn't need the formula anymore. During this phase, Pete strikes Debbie in the face, knocking her to the ground. Pete then regains control of himself and changes back to his normal self before joining Debbie on the floor. Despite being struck by her boyfriend turned monster, Debbie has no problem excusing Pete's actions. Afterwards, Debbie meets Oz by the fountain to get his biology notes. Noticing the bruise on her eye, Oz stops Debbie from leaving right away by lightly grabbing her shoulder and asking if she's okay. From a distance, Pete watches this whole conversation.

With evidence indicating that Mr. Platt was killed during the day, Oz is off the hook. In the library, the group draws a connection between the two victims and Debbie. Oz tells the others about Debbie's bruised eye, which doesn't quite follow with the suddenness of Mr. Platt's death. This leads them to suspect Pete, both for the two murders and for striking Debbie. While Oz locks himself in the cage for the third and final night of the month, Buffy and Willow confront Debbie. Unfortunately, Debbie refuses to help them stop Pete. During the conversation, Angel breaks his chains free of the mansion wall and escapes.

Buffy and Willow have no idea that Pete is in the library at that very moment, ready to kill Oz for touching Debbie. Pete changes into his monster form and rips the door off the cage. After throwing Oz around the library for a little while, the sun finally sets and the moon shines, allowing Oz to turn the tables on Pete. In his werewolf form, Oz is an even match for Pete's ferocity. The sounds of their battle alerts the others to the library. Buffy tries to knock them out with the dart gun, but shoots Giles instead when Debbie pushes the gun off to the side just as Buffy pulls the trigger. While the tranquilizer dart takes Giles out of the action, Oz and Pete break apart and escape into the school hallways. Willow and Faith take down Oz with the dart gun. Buffy chases Pete to the maintenance room, where she finds Debbie dead on the floor, murdered by Pete. Another fight ensues. Just as it appears that Buffy's about to lose the fight, Angel arrives and kills Pete. To Buffy's surprise, Angel manages to say her name before falling to his knees and embracing her.

The next day, Buffy can't find the words to console Scott, who lost two of his best friends without ever knowing the truth about what really happened. Later that night, Buffy watches Angel as he sleeps on the floor of the mansion. He constantly flinches and trembles, apparently suffering from nightmares of his time in Hell.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

What appears to be the series' latest examination of werewolf-lore evolves into a rather ham-fisted interpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic 1886 novella 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. Of course the two are quite closely related, but 'Beauty and the Beasts' lacks the core idea that makes Stevenson's work so compelling (that Jekyll rather enjoys being the bestial Hyde, before he eventually becomes irreversibly transformed).

Instead the episode begins as a rather limp whodunit with Oz under suspicion for a series of animalistic attacks. A great deal of time is wasted before the real story kicks in, and the focus shifts to the more intriguing relationship between Debbie and Pete. Unfortunately the rest of the episode is rather rushed, and routinely plotted.

If there is a message in Marti Noxon's script - perhaps Faith's assertion that "all men are beasts" - it's trampled in the unseemly rush for the finale. Two plot elements deserve to be singled out for special criticism: the awkward scene where Buffy discovers that Platt - a promising character who could have been built up for at least an episode or three - has been "pureed", and Angel's rapid recovery. And - like, hey! - just when did he put those trousers on!?

(I reckon it's Angel's little-known ability to regenerate his clothes... remember when he jumped out of bed in @{"Surprise" LINK "SURPRISE"}, suddenly all dressed in black?!)

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Giles' suggestion that Angel may have been in Hell for hundreds of years - given that time in that dimension moves at a different rate (see @{"Anne" LINK "ANNE"}) - now makes precisely pinpointing Angel's age rather difficult.

Pop Culture: Several movies are mentioned or quoted, including 'The Full Monty' (Xander's "I can handle the Oz Full Monty"); 'The English Patient' (Faith's "Every guy from Manimal down to Mr. I-Love-The-English-Patient has beast in him") and 'The Sound of Music' (Buffy's reference to its title song: "Three-dimensional, Sensurround, The Hills Are Alive..."). Coincidentally all of them were Academy Award winners, and all won Oscars for their music. Sensurround was created by Universal in 1974, to give extra bass rumble to the disaster epic 'Earthquake'. 'Manimal' was an awful TV series about a college professor who could change into any type of animal. It ran for eight episodes in 1983. Platt also at one point says to Buffy "You're bringing me in at the end of the movie here."

3ABB05

With Homecoming approaching, Cordelia plans to start her campaign for the title of Homecoming queen, while the rest of the gang debates on their mode of transportation to the dance. Buffy, however, is still distracted by Angel's recent return, so she takes off for the mansion shortly after Scott asks her to the dance. At the mansion, Buffy assures Angel that nobody else knows that he's back. To Angel's dismay, Buffy also tells him that she's currently seeing another guy. Unfortunately, that statement doesn't hold true for much longer, for Scott dumps Buffy the very next morning. He explains that the down and depressed Buffy he knows now is not the same Buffy he knew before they started dating. After Scott leaves, Buffy wanders around outside of the school alone... and completely unaware of the two German men who are watching her from inside a van. Using state-of-the-art equipment, they transmit their visual to a lavish mansion, where an old man receives the signal and shows the image of Buffy to his boss:
Mr. Trick.

At City Hall, Mayor Richard Wilkins III learns from his deputy mayor that two German brothers with impressive criminal records have recently been spotted in Sunnydale. Their names are Frederick and Hans Gruenshtahler, and they're the same two men who have been spying on Buffy. The Mayor isn't too worried about this. In fact, he's more concerned with cleanliness and personal hygiene, which he displays by closely inspecting his deputy mayor's hands. Meanwhile, at Sunnydale High, the senior class gets its pictures taken in the lounge for their fourth and final high school yearbook. Buffy's a no-show, so Cordelia heads to the library to tell her about the photo session. Before she can enter the library, Cordy is distracted by her Homecoming queen campaign priorities and completely forgets to inform Buffy. Inside the library, Buffy and Faith plan to attend the dance together since Scott is no longer in the picture.

The next day, Buffy asks one of her favorite teachers from the previous school year, Ms. Moran, to write her a recommendation to give to Principal Snyder. Buffy needs the recommendation to fulfill one of the conditions set by Snyder for her readmittance. However, Ms. Moran can't even remember Buffy's name, let alone anything about her to merit a written recommendation. Buffy's woes increase at lunch when she learns from Xander and the others that she missed the yearbook photo session. Upset with Cordy's irresponsibility, Buffy approaches the Homecoming queen candidate and speaks her mind. Naturally, Cordy retaliates with her own special brand of verbal abuse. This motivates Buffy to compete with Cordy and run for Homecoming queen herself. Later that night, Mr. Trick assembles a promising group of hunters at his mansion for an event called Slayerfest '98. Included in this group of hunters: Frawley, a human hunter with a rifle and a set of bear traps; Lyle and Candy Gorch, two recently-married vampires; Frederick and Hans Gruenshtahler, the German brothers who have been tracking Buffy's every move; and Kulak, a yellow-skinned demon who keeps jagged blades inside his forearms. Mr. Trick hopes this Slayerfest will see the end of both Buffy and Faith. Meanwhile, at the Rosenberg residence, Xander helps Willow pick out a dress for the dance while he tries on the tuxedo he'll be wearing. Initially, they discuss their relationships with Cordelia and Oz. However, after Willow puts on her best dress and Xander completes his attire, the only thing on their minds is each other. While Xander gives Willow a brief lesson on dancing, the two best friends lose themselves in the moment and share a kiss. That moment is quickly interrupted when they both realize what they've done, both to themselves and their significant others.

The next morning, Buffy learns that she'll be campaigning alone, since all of her friends have already committed to helping Cordy. Buffy and Cordy kick their Homecoming queen campaigns into full gear, hoping to outdo each other in the race for the title. While Buffy convinces Willow to give her a little help, Frederick and Hans listen in on their conversation. They pay particular attention to Buffy's announcement that the limo will pick up Faith first, Buffy second, and the rest of the group afterwards. Later in the day, Buffy learns that Cordy has been paying some of the students money to get their votes. This leads to another argument between the two candidates, only this one ends on a much harsher note. Distraught, Willow tells Xander that their brief tryst must be partly responsible for the current feud between Buffy and Cordelia. Eventually, Xander and Willow's conversation turns to the bigger problem at hand: what are they themselves going to do now. Later that night, the limo stops at the Summers home to pick up Buffy as planned. Buffy is surprised to find Cordy inside instead of Faith. According to a note written by the gang, Buffy and Cordy will be taking the limo to the dance alone so that they may work out their differences before the crowning of the Homecoming queen.

Included with the note are a couple of corsages. The limo's destination is not the dance, however, but rather the nearby woods. Buffy and Cordy step out of the limo and notice a monitor and VCR set up on a table, along with a sign that informs them to play the tape.

Buffy and Cordy watch a recording of Mr. Trick, who welcomes Buffy and Faith to Slayerfest '98. Apparently, they expected Faith to be in Cordy's place. Before Cordy can clear up the confusion, the monitor explodes, and the hunt begins. The first hunter they run into is Frawley, who Buffy immobilizes by knocking him into one of his own traps. Unable to free his leg, Frawley informs Buffy and Cordy of the rest of the hunter group.

While Buffy and Cordy take refuge inside a cabin, Xander and Willow find themselves guilty and ashamed at the dance, even after Giles commends them on their effort to resolve the feud between Buffy and Cordy. In the cabin, Cordy finds a telephone which Buffy uses to call Giles at the library. Buffy explains to Cordy that she's running for Homecoming queen because she wants a high school memory that doesn't involve her job as the Slayer. Suddenly, Kulak bursts into the cabin and attacks Buffy. During their battle, Frederick and Hans approach the cabin. They are being navigated by the old man, who is tracking Buffy and Cordy with his computer system back at the mansion. The German brothers fire an explosive device into the cabin, which causes Buffy to stop her battle with Kulak and escape with Cordy. Kulak fails in his attempt to get out of the cabin, and he is killed in the explosion. Buffy and Cordy get up from the ground and head back to the library, unaware that Lyle and Candy Gorch have knocked out Giles and are waiting for them to arrive.

While Buffy and Cordy head to the library, a pair of police officers arrive at Mr. Trick's mansion and escort him away, against his will. At the library, Buffy fights with Candy Gorch before dusting her. Enraged, Lyle moves in to attack, but Cordy stops him short and launches into an impressive speech that scares Lyle into taking off. After Giles regains consciousness, he points out that he wasn't aware of the group buying corsages for Buffy and Cordy. Buffy notices small electronic devices in the corsages, which the old man must have been using to track their movements. They hear the German brothers in the hallway, so Buffy binds the bugs together with a bundle of wet toilet paper. After leading one of the brothers into a classroom, she throws the mass of toilet paper onto his back. The old man gives the other brother the coordinates, and both Frederick and Hans proceed to shoot each other dead. Meanwhile, the two police officers bring Mr. Trick to City Hall, where Mayor Wilkins introduces himself. He reveals that he's quite aware that Mr. Trick is a vampire, and he wants his help in eliminating the "rebellious element" from Sunnydale. Mr. Trick realizes that the Mayor is referring to the Slayers.

At the dance, Buffy and Cordy finally arrive, only to learn that neither of them is the new Homecoming queen, for the other two candidates win the election in a tie.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

The Homecoming dance is one of those weird American customs that seems somewhat bizarre to English audiences and 'Homecoming' is based on the strangest aspect of the whole notion: the Homecoming Queen contest, a concept that summons up heady 'Wicker Man'-type images of lambs being led to the slaughter.

The highlight of the episode, and, not coincidentally, the only element of the story that has any lasting resonance, is the kiss between Xander and Willow which revives a storyline that harks back to the groundwork laid out in the series' earliest episodes.

It's a scene that's rather clumsily set up, but it's rescued by David Greenwalt's sharp dialogue and direction and, especially, by excellent comic performances by Alyson and Nicholas. The rest of the episode doesn't seem to know where to settle. There's no real symbiosis between the plot strands about the two parallel contests (the Homecoming Queen competition and SlayerFest), but at least pairing Buffy and Cordelia as the SlayerFest prey re-establishes some of the self-centred rivalry that made Cordelia so sparky. Her confrontation with Lyle Gorch is a joy to behold, as is her dumbfounded astonishment at not being voted Homecoming Queen.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

This episode probably owes a debt of gratitude to the 1932 RKO movie 'The Most Dangerous Game', about a sadistic Count who hunts shipwrecked humans on his own personal Malayan island. The Count eventually met his match when pitted against a big game hunter. The movie was based on a well-known short story by Richard Connell, which has been filmed many times: most notably in 1946 (as 'A Game of Death'), in 1951 (as 'The Black Castle'), in 1954 (as 'The Black Forest'), in 1956 (as 'Run for The Sun') and in 1961 (as 'Bloodlust'). The 1932 movie, made by the same team that created 'King Kong', is by far the best and most popular version. (In the UK it was re-titled 'The Hounds of Zaroff').

Lyle Gorch was one of the vampire brothers that Buffy encountered in @{"Bad Eggs" LINK "BADEGGS"}, during which the other brother is killed by the Bezoar.

After he was mentioned in many previous episodes, 'Homecoming' is the first to actually feature the Mayor, Richard Wilkins III (Ian Abercrombie). It also introduces Deputy Mayor Allan Finch (Jack Plotnick). Look out, too, for Jonathan (Danny Strong), the geek whose vote Cordelia has bought for six dollars ("That buys a whole lotta cupcakes!"). Jonathan has appeared regularly in Buffy (his debut was in 'Inca Mummy Girl'). Keep an eye on him, because one day he's going to be a @{"Superstar" LINK "SUPERSTAR"} !

@{b}Band Candy@{ub}
3ABB06

Buffy's S.A.T. is coming up, so Giles helps her study for it at the cemetery while waiting for any vampires to rise from their graves. At City Hall, Mayor Wilkins enlists Mr. Trick's aid for an upcoming tribute to a demon. Mr. Trick just so happens to know a man who can help them.

The next morning, Principal Snyder enlists students to sell candy in order to raise money for Sunnydale High's marching band, and Buffy and the gang are at the top of Snyder's recruitment list. After Buffy convinces her mother to buy some candy, she revives their long-standing debate over whether or not she can get a license and start driving. Joyce remains uncomfortable with the notion of her daughter behind a steering wheel. Buffy then heads off for the library, telling her mother that she has some more training to do with Giles. Joyce is not pleased with how much time Buffy has to spend working with Giles. At the library, Buffy trains briefly with Giles before leaving early, explaining to him that her mom wants her home early. Buffy then visits Angel at the mansion, bringing along a container of blood from the butcher shop. When Buffy finally goes home, she is surprised to find both her mom and her Watcher waiting for her in the foyer. They both have figured out that Buffy lied to them in order to go someplace else, although Joyce suspects that place was the Bronze. Unhappy with the way she's being treated, Buffy expresses how she can't fulfill both of their demands for the amount of time they want to spend with her. After Buffy goes to her room, Giles and Joyce relax on the couch, curiously eating one candy bar after another. Elsewhere, these same candy bars are being packaged in a factory. Overlooking the whole process is none other than Giles' old rival, Ethan Rayne.

Buffy, Cordy, Xander, Willow, and several other students sit in study hall on Friday, waiting for their supervisor to arrive. The staff member assigned to study hall this day happens to be Giles, who is uncharacteristically late. While the students wait, Xander and Willow engage in a forbidden game of footsie under their table, apparently still hung up over each other after their kiss on Homecoming week. Principal Snyder talks one of the teacher, Ms. Barton, into filling in for Giles. Buffy is both surprised and dismayed to learn that Giles never showed up, but she and the rest of the students are even more surprised when Ms. Barton speaks to them loosely and freely, going so far as to refer to their principal as "Commandant Snyder".

After school, Buffy goes to Giles' apartment to find out where he was, but that soon becomes irrelevant when she notices that her mother is there as well. Giles explains that he and Joyce have been working out a schedule to make it easier for Buffy to spend enough time with the both of them. Joyce then stuns her daughter by handing her the keys to her jeep, telling Buffy to drive herself home. After Buffy grabs the keys and leaves, Giles lights up a cigarette, dropping the charade that he and Joyce were putting on for Buffy when she arrived just now. Not one to pass up on an opportunity like this, Buffy picks up Willow in the jeep and drives off to the Bronze, displaying a horrific driving ability along the way. At the Bronze, Buffy and Willow immediately notice the vast number of adults present, which is unusual for any given night at the Bronze. Even stranger is that all of the adults are acting like rowdy teenagers, including Principal Snyder, who acts like he's just one of the Scooby Gang. While Buffy and Willow try to decipher this phenomenon, Giles and Joyce drink, smoke, and listen to old LP's before heading out into town. Giles and Joyce stroll by the store windows, one of which showcases a coat that catches Joyce's eye. Giles breaks into the window and steals the coat for the new "girl" in his life. A cop tries to stop them, but Giles makes short work of the cop and takes his gun before leaving the scene with Joyce.

Back at the Bronze, Buffy decides that they need to get out and find some answers. As Buffy, Willow, and Oz leave the Bronze and get into the jeep, Snyder follows them into the car. Since time is definitely an issue, Buffy lets him tag along. Meanwhile, adults all over town are acting like teenagers, just like the people at the Bronze. Two guys even get into a drag race, and one of them smashes into Buffy's jeep. After everyone gets out of the car, one man runs by and steals Snyder's candy bar. Buffy realizes that there must be something wrong with the candy. Buffy instructs Willow and Oz to get Xander and Cordelia and head to the library, while she and Snyder drive to the candy bar factory.

Buffy and Snyder arrive at the factory, where a huge mob of adults are gathered around the entrance to get more candy bars. On her way to the entrance, Buffy is distracted by the sight of Giles kissing Joyce right in front of her eyes. Unable to deal with them at this moment, Buffy knocks out the workers and enters the factory, with Giles, Joyce, and Snyder following closely behind. Inside, Buffy finds Ethan, who wastes no time in running away. He tries to lose them in the maze of candy bar boxes, but Buffy eventually finds him. Back at the library, the rest of the gang tries to find some useful information, but they can't do much without a good lead. Buffy learns from Ethan that his job was mainly to divert the adults from the main objective, which is to pay tribute to a demon named Lurconis. Oz and Willow discover that Lurconis feeds on babies.

Unbeknownst to any of them, a group of vampires walk into the hospital nursery and steal four of the infants there. Buffy and the others are too late in getting to the hospital. However, Giles is able to recall that Lurconis means "glutton", and that they should be able to find him in the sewers. They go down into the sewer tunnels and find the babies, along with Mr. Trick, the other four vampires, and the Mayor. As soon as Buffy and Giles arrive, Mayor Wilkinson immediately flees the scene. While Buffy fights the vampires, Giles and Joyce move the babies out of harm's way. During the battle, Buffy throws one of the vampires into a large pool. A large rumbling soon follows, and Lurconis, a huge serpentine creature, emerges from an opening next to the pool and devours the hapless vampire. Mr. Trick challenges the Slayer to a fight, but her Watcher intervenes and attempts to take on the vampire. Mr. Trick easily tosses Giles into the pool and escapes. With Lurconis coming back for seconds, Buffy detaches a fuel line and ignites the open end on one of the torches that the vampires set up, creating a giant blowtorch. As Lurconis emerges from the opening once again, Buffy roasts the demon, sending it back into its dwelling.

Afterwards, Mayor Wilkinson expresses his disappointment in Mr. Trick's failure, warning him not to make the same mistakes again.

The following Monday morning, all the adults in Sunnydale are back to normal. Buffy laments to Giles after school about the disaster that was her S.A.T. They meet up with Joyce by the jeep, which is still wrecked. Buffy is relieved that she was able to stop Giles and Joyce before they went a little too far with their carefree romance... or so she believes.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

There's much to enjoy in this episode, from the terrific pre-credits scene in the cemetery ("I'm going with 'B' - we haven't had 'B' in forever") to the sly final exchange (Buffy's "At least I got to the two of you before you actually did something").

'Band Candy' is an episode with really crackling dialogue and a strong, linear plot, probably the result of the appointment of new Executive Story Editor and this episode's writer - Jane Espenson, who can certainly be forgiven for a rather hackneyed core plot idea. The key storyline reintroduces Ethan Rayne, who has devised an overly elaborate plan to divert attention from his mission to steal infants from the hospital. It's a plot that develops steadily, subtly building hints that the adults are slowly regressing. The episode even finds room to develop the storyline involving the recovering Angel, who has recently been sidelined, and physically separated from the rest of the gang. The icing on the cake is a trio of terrific performances from Armin Shimerman, Anthony Stewart Head and Kristine Sutherland, all revealing aspects to their characters which have previously only been hinted at: Giles the tearaway, Joyce the flirt and Snyder the excitable nerd.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Xander's question to the uncharacteristically cheery Snyder "You weren't visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past by any chance?" is, of course, a reference to Charles Dickens' 1843 novel "A Christmas Carol", in which the misanthropic Scrooge is reformed by four visiting spirits.

Pop Culture: This is an episode stuffed full of pop culture references, many of which will mean very little to British audiences. Buffy's exclamation "Let's do the time warp again!" when they enter the Bronze to find it full of aging adolescents refers to a line from the most infectious song in Richard O'Brien's horror-themed musical "Rocky Horror Show". (Anthony Stewart Head played the lead character, Doctor Frank N. Furter in a West End production of the show, so perhaps it wasn't entirely coincidental).

3ABB07

After Dingoes Ate My Baby finishes its set during a particularly crowded night at the Bronze, Oz joins Willow, Xander, and Cordelia at their table. Hoping to divert attention away from her and Xander's uneasiness around each other, Willow brings up the topic of Buffy acting differently as of late. Cordy suggests that Buffy might have found a new man. Buffy stops by briefly before heading off with Faith towards the cemetery for a rendezvous with Giles. In no time, Buffy and Faith are battling two newly-risen vampires while their Watcher observes. After successfully vanquishing the vampires ("Synchronised slaying - new Olympic category?"), a woman arrives on the scene. She criticizes Buffy and Faith's performance, then identifies herself as Mrs. Gwendolyn Post - Faith's new Watcher.

Upon returning to the library, Gwendolyn Post informs Giles, Buffy, and Faith that she has been sent by the Watchers' Council to serve as Faith's Watcher, as well as report back to the Council about the situation in Sunnydale with Giles and Buffy. In addition, Gwendolyn has information regarding a demon named Lagos, who has come to Sunnydale in search of a deadly weapon called the Glove of Myhnegon. It's apparent from the start that Gwendolyn doesn't have a great deal of respect for Giles' abilities, as she mocks both his resources ("Where is the actual library?!") and his efficiency. After Faith leaves with her newly appointed Watcher, Buffy goes to the mansion for her own training session with Angel. In the heat of the moment, they nearly kiss before Buffy pulls back at the last second. As she leaves, Buffy casually mentions Lagos' name, which brings a look of concern to Angel's face.

Back at the library, Giles' frustration steadily grows due to his difficulty in finding any relevant information on Lagos. He vents that frustration on Xander, demanding that he either help with the research or leave. Xander joins an exhausted Willow in the search through the books, and they settle down behind one of the stacks. One thing leads to another, and Willow is soon madly kissing Xander. Completely lost in their passion, neither of them realizes that Giles is merely a few feet away. His voice breaks them out of their spell and brings them to their feet. Luckily, the librarian is too focused on the book in his hands to notice what Willow and Xander were doing. Giles tells them that he discovered the possible location of the Glove of Myhnegon: inside the Von Hauptman family crypt in Restfield Cemetery. Xander immediately volunteers to go to the cemetery and check out the crypt. Meanwhile, Buffy and Faith decide to call it a night and postpone the rest of their patrol through the numerous cemeteries of Sunnydale. While Buffy heads home to sleep, Faith passes through Shady Hill Cemetery, where she finds the demon Lagos rummaging through a tomb. Faith engages the demon, but she quickly ends up on her back with the wind knocked out of her. She can only watch as Lagos gives up his search through the tomb and walks away. Finding the glove is the only thing on Lagos' mind. Over at Restfield Cemetery, Xander arrives at the Von Hauptman crypt just in time to see somebody walking out of the entrance. To his surprise, Xander recognizes the person as Angel, who is carrying a wrapped object in his hands. Without being noticed, Xander follows Angel back to the Crawford Street mansion and witnesses yet another surprise through the window: Buffy, with her arms wrapped around Angel... kissing him. After Xander leaves, Buffy and Angel break their kiss and regain control of themselves.

Buffy is about to leave when Angel tells her that he has the weapon that Lagos is searching for. He takes her over to the object which he took from the crypt, then unwraps it to reveal the Glove of Myhnegon. Angel stops Buffy from touching it, warning her that the glove cannot be removed once you put it on. At Giles' apartment, Gwendolyn Post relaxes while Giles locates an illustration of the Glove of Myhnegon in one of his books. As they take a tea break, Xander bursts in with an urgent announcement concerning Buffy for Giles' ears only.

Buffy enters the library the next morning with good news about the glove, only to find Giles and all of her friends sitting around the table with serious looks on their faces. Xander vacates his chair so that Buffy can be seated. After she sits down, Giles tells her that her secret about Angel is officially out in the open. Buffy tries to defend her stance, emphasizing the fact that Angel is no longer the uncontrollable murderer that he became after his fateful "moment of happiness". However, her friends refuse to accept Buffy's excuses, especially Xander. Fed up with his accusations, Buffy grabs Xander by the arm and questions his motives for wanting Angel dead. Giles stops the debate and sends everybody back to class before things get out of hand. Buffy follows her Watcher into his office and reassures him that Angel got the glove before Lagos could find it. Giles, however, doesn't want to hear any more of Buffy's excuses. He reminds her of how Angel tortured him months ago. Giles then acknowledges the fact that Buffy was wrong to keep Angel's return a secret from her Watcher, and she has gravely disrespected him by doing so. Meanwhile, Gwendolyn pays a visit to Faith's place. While assuring Faith that her intentions are pure, Gwendolyn alludes to Giles' secret meeting with Buffy and her friends. Faith is not pleased to be left out of that equation. Back at Sunnydale High, Buffy finds Willow at her locker and asks if everything's all right between them. Preoccupied with her own secret, Willow does not hesitate to pardon Buffy for keeping Angel's return under wraps. Buffy then tells her friend that she plans to wait in front of the Von Hauptman crypt and kill Lagos when he arrives.

Later that night, Faith finds Xander at the Bronze, shooting pool by himself. Xander fills Faith in on the news that Angel's back in town, the Glove of Myhnegon is in his possession, and Buffy has no problems with any of this. Faith decides to kill Angel, and Xander is eager to tag along. As they head towards the library, Gwendolyn enters Giles' office and finds out that the Glove of Myhnegon has been found and is currently in the mansion on Crawford Street. Giles then surprises her with a spell he discovered that can destroy the glove. The spell creates a living flame, which can incinerate the Glove of Myhnegon. After Giles turns around, Gwendolyn picks up a statue and bashes him in the head twice, sending him to the floor, unconscious and bleeding. At Restfield Cemetery, Willow is about to divulge her secret to Buffy about her new relationship with Xander when Lagos suddenly appears. After a rough fight, Buffy grabs the axe from Lagos' back and uses it to chop his head off. As they head back to the library, Faith and Xander arrive to collect a few weapons from the armory in the bookcage. On their way out, Xander hears a moan coming from Giles' office. He finds Giles on the floor, quickly losing a lot of blood. Faith believes Angel did this, but Xander points out the lack of bite marks. Faith doesn't care about that detail, and she leaves for the mansion while Xander calls for an ambulance.

Aware of the method for destroying the glove, Angel completes the spell for the living flame. He then turns around to see that Gwendolyn Post has entered the room. She concocts a lie to convince Angel that the living flame can strengthen the glove if the spell was miscast. As Angel turns his back to her, Gwendolyn picks up a shovel and strikes the back of the vampire's head, knocking him to the floor. Meanwhile, Buffy and Willow arrive at the library, where paramedics are in the process of bringing Giles out to the ambulance. Before he is taken away, Giles tells Buffy that she must destroy the glove with living flame. Xander tells Buffy that Faith is already on her way to the mansion, convinced that Angel needs to die. Buffy tells Willow to find the spell for the living flame, then dashes towards the mansion, where Gwendolyn is trying to open the locked chest which contains the glove. Back at the library, Xander and Willow finish the preparations for the spell and head to the mansion. Before Gwendolyn can open the chest, Angel hops to his feet, his face morphed to its vampire state. Gwendolyn breaks the shovel handle in half and tries to stake Angel, but he easily knocks the weapon away and throws Gwendolyn into the wall. As he moves in to grab her, Faith arrives and sees her new Watcher about to be murdered by a vampire. Faith overwhelms Angel and is about to finish the job when Buffy arrives and stops the stake's descent. Buffy tries to convince Faith that Angel is not the enemy, but Gwendolyn urges her Slayer to do her job. Faith and Buffy begin to fight each other. Their battle takes them crashing through a window and into one of the outside courtyards. Xander and Willow arrive in the midst of the fight. Xander tries to stop them, but Faith tosses him aside and continues the fight. Using the Slayers' distraction to her advantage, Gwendolyn opens the chest and pulls out the glove and knocks Willow to the floor with it, then puts on the Glove of Myhnegon, which latches itself to her arm. As she raises the glove above her head and chants in Gaelic, thunder begins to rumble over the mansion. The loud thunder stops Buffy and Faith, and they turn their attention towards Gwendolyn. As they watch on, Gwendolyn screams a command which causes lightning to strike the glove from the sky, then fly out from the glove towards its target. Buffy and Faith dodge the blast, but just barely. As Willow gets up from the floor, Gwendolyn turns and fires a lightning bolt in her direction. Angel runs in and pushes Willow out of the way of the bolt. Faith runs around the room to draw her fire away from Buffy, who picks up a shard of the broken window and throws it at Gwendolyn's gloved arm. The glass cuts right through her arm, causing it to fall to the floor by Gwendolyn's feet. The dismemberment causes the glove to fire again, but since it is now beneath her, the lightning flies down from the sky and strikes Gwendolyn, burning her into oblivion.

The next morning, Oz, Willow, Xander, and Cordy talk in the lounge about Buffy and Angel, as well as destroying the Glove of Myhnegon with the living flame. Xander concedes that having Angel around again will be fine as long as Buffy doesn't repeat the same mistakes that led to the lifting of the curse. Buffy arrives and makes peace with Xander. Giles then walks into the lounge and tells the group that Gwendolyn Post was kicked out by the Watchers' Council a couple years ago. After school, Buffy visits Faith's place. She tells Faith to not worry about trusting her, but Faith still feels betrayed and is not in the mood for conversation. As Buffy turns to leave, Faith begins to tell her something, but decides to keep it to herself for now.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

The success of this episode hinges on one simple deception, one that only really works if you buy into Serena Scott Thomas's mannered performance as the haughty Gwendolyn Post, Faith's new watcher. Douglas Petrie's script cleverly relies on audience expectations. He guesses that it will have crossed most viewers' mind that Giles' unconventional training methods would sooner or later become of concern to the Watcher's Council. This is an arc idea that will be explored again in later episodes.

The episode gets off to a good start with a good pre-credits cliffhanger and continues nicely with scenes of tension between Giles and Post, and Post and her new protégées. Before very long, we're back on a routine quest for some McGuffin or other, which is being sought by yet another nondescript demon. The mundane begins to infiltrate.

Events get really quite depressing when Buffy's friends round on her for hiding the fact that Angel has returned - "What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover?" - causing considerable rifts among the gang. The tension even extends to Buffy and Giles, who is obviously disappointed. He expresses his sadness in a speech beautifully delivered by Anthony Stewart Head ("You have no respect for me, or the job I do.")

However, after Gwendolyn's death, most of the Scooby Gang's differences are resolved to a satisfactory level. One big problem remains however, Willow and Xander's secret relationship. Willow tries to confess to Buffy during this episode, but is interrupted by the approach of Lagos. Faith also appears to have a secret that she isn't ready to tell Buffy yet.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Serena Scott Thomas (Gwendolyn Post) played Princess Diana in a controversial 1993 TV movie based on Andrew Morton's book "Diana: Her True Story". Serena is the sister of "The English Patient" star Kristin Scott Thomas.

Pop Culture: Faith's line "Excuse me, Mary Poppins, you don't seem to be listening" refers to a prim and proper English nanny who had magical powers, created by Pamela L. Travers in her 1934 novel "Mary Poppins". Travers wrote a series of books involving the character, but most people will know Poppins from Disney's Oscar winning 1964 film adaptation, which starred Julie Andrews.

3ABB08

Buffy Summers surprises her friends with her S.A.T. scores, which are a combined total of 1430. While everybody is fairly excited by this news, Buffy herself is more concerned with the fact that she may have to consider her future more seriously. Later that night, a car runs over the welcome sign at Sunnydale's city limits. Completely drunk, a familiar figure tumbles out of the driver's side door: Spike. Spike heads to the burnt-out factory where he originally stayed with Drusilla before Giles' invasion forced them to leave. Spike laments over his recent break-up with Dru as he smashes one of her old dolls.

The next morning, Xander convinces Cordelia to join Oz and Willow on a double date at the bowling alley. Xander notices that Cordy has taped pictures of herself and Xander, along with Oz and Willow, to the inside of her locker door. After confirming the plans, Oz follows Willow to her locker and gives her a pez dispenser with a witch's head on it as an impromptu gift. Overcome with guilt, Willow confronts Xander outside and tries to convince him that the double date is a bad idea. In the library, Giles admires Buffy's S.A.T. scores while he finishes packing for a retreat at Breaker's Woods. Buffy mentions her mother's enthusiasm and encouragement to apply to major colleges across the country.

Giles agrees that Buffy should take advantage of this opportunity, while Faith could keep an eye on Sunnydale. Elsewhere, the deputy mayor informs Mayor Wilkins that Spike is back in town. Mayor Wilkins agrees with his suggestion that they get Mr. Trick to send a vampire committee to take care of Spike. Later, after school, Buffy and Joyce discuss college plans. Joyce continuously mentions out-of-state universities. Meanwhile, Spike goes to the Crawford Street mansion and spies on Angel, who is reading a book inside. Still drunk, Spike passes out on the floor of the garden.

As the sun rises the next morning, Spike is abruptly woken up by the sight and pain of his burning hand, which has been ignited by the sunlight. He goes to a local magic shop in search of a curse to cast on Angel. Spike hides as Willow enters. He looks on as Willow buys a few ingredients for a de-lusting spell, which she hopes will put an end to her affair with Xander. After Willow leaves, Spike feeds on the shopkeeper and formulates a new plan to get what he wants. At the mansion, Angel tells Buffy that she should look into college. This causes Buffy to leave early. Later that night, Xander finds Willow working on some sort of experiment in the science lab. While they wait for Cordelia and Oz to meet them there for the double date, Xander realizes that Willow is actually performing a spell. She tells him about the nature of the spell, and Xander is not pleased with Willow's preferred method of dealing with their situation. Suddenly, Spike appears to kidnap Willow. While Xander fights Spike, Willow attempts to hit the vampire with a heavy object. Spike grabs it out of Willow's hands and strikes Xander directly in the head, knocking him out. Willow and Xander are then brought to the factory and locked in the basement. While Xander lays on a bed, unconscious and bloody, Spike demands Willow to perform a love spell that will bring Drusilla back to him. Willow tells Spike that she still needs a few additional ingredients and the right spell book. Back at Sunnydale High, Cordy and Oz barge into the library where Buffy is training. Worried about Xander and Willow's absence, they take Buffy to the science lab and show her the aftermath of the fight. Buffy sends them to find Giles at his retreat while she goes back to the library to properly equip herself for the search. Before Buffy can enter the bookcage, the phone rings. It's Joyce, and as Buffy listens, Spike enters the Summers' home. As soon as Buffy hears the familiar voice, she drops the phone and runs home as fast as she can.

Joyce makes a couple cups of coffee while Spike tells her his sob story about what happened between himself and Drusilla. Outside, Angel approaches the house. He sees Spike sitting at the kitchen counter with Joyce and tries to run into the house, but can't do so without an invitation. Joyce is terrified to see Angel again, unaware that the real enemy is standing right behind her. Distracted, Spike doesn't even notice Buffy's entrance as she grabs him from behind and pins him to the counter. Joyce watches in confusion while Buffy invites Angel into the house to help with Spike. Spike tells them what he's done with Willow and Xander, but he doesn't say where they are. Buffy and Angel reluctantly agree to help Spike get what he needs for the love spell in exchange for her friends' safety.

Meanwhile, Oz picks up Willow's scent, so he cancels the drive to Breaker's Woods and tries to find Willow and Xander instead. Cordelia is not too comfortable with the fact that Oz still has a few latent werewolf abilities even when it's not that time of the month. Buffy and Angel follow Spike to the magic shop to get the ingredients. While there, Spike mocks Buffy and Angel's attempt to be nothing more than friends. Spike insists that they will forever be in love with each other, just like he is with Dru. At the factory, Xander finally comes to and learns from Willow everything that's happened. Realizing that their situation is seemingly hopeless, Xander and Willow lay on the bed and kiss, unaware of the fact that Oz and Cordelia have just arrived to rescue them. Nobody can believe what they're seeing, and Cordy takes it the hardest. As she runs back up the stairs, one of the deteriorated steps crumbles. Cordy falls through the hole to the hard floor below. When Xander looks down through the hole, he sees that Cordy is impaled on a steel rod, which is sticking up from her torso.

After gathering all of the ingredients, Spike, Buffy, and Angel run into a large group of vampires outside of the magic shop. One of the group's head vampires, Lenny, is not too pleased with Spike's return to Sunnydale. A huge battle erupts on the street.

Outnumbered, the three retreat into the magic shop and seal off the entrances. They miss one of the doors in the back, which is soon opened by the invading vampires. As the battle spills into the magic shop, Spike drives a stake through Lenny's heart, reducing him to dust. More vampires bust through the window, but they are quickly thwarted off by the vials of holy water thrown by Buffy and Angel. Spike is thoroughly satisfied with the emotional rush from the battle, and decides to forget about the love spell and win Drusilla back by being his old self. Spike tells them that Willow and Xander are at the factory, then leaves. Meanwhile, at the factory, Xander climbs down to the injured Cordelia while Oz leaves to get help. Luckily, none of Cordy's organs were punctured by the rod, but her distress over Xander's betrayal is beyond repair. While Buffy comforts Willow about the whole situation, Xander tries his own luck at the hospital where Cordy is recovering. He brings her flowers and tries to apologize, but Cordy simply tells Xander to stay away. Later, Buffy goes to the mansion and tells Angel that she won't visit him anymore. Buffy can't get out of her mind what Spike said about the two of them, so she decides to break off her contact with Angel. While everybody somberly reflects to themselves about what happened during the past few days, a jubilant Spike leaves Sunnydale once again.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

Dan Vebber, making an auspicious "Buffy" writing debut, helps to restore things to normal after some recent out-of-character anomalies (Willow's reluctance to help research and Xander's spiteful attitude in "Revelations", for example). There is still some amusing unfulfilled attraction between Xander and Willow to work through, but otherwise things are just peachy.

There's been very little interaction so far between Buffy and this season's arch villains (the Mayor and Mister Trick, in case you were wondering), so the return of Spike is a very welcome development. Here we get to see a whole new side of Spike, whose drunken, lovelorn ramblings make him more sympathetic than ever. His scenes with Willow and Joyce, in which he recounts his sob story, are well-written and beautifully performed. "She wouldn't even kill me. She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head or set me on fire!".

This is undeniably Spike's episode, culminating in a terrific speech that undermines Buffy's and Angel's relationship, while defending his hopeless love for Drusilla: "You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, children. It's blood, blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it".

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

According to the "Welcome to Sunnydale" sign that Spike knocks over at the beginning of this episode, Sunnydale's population is 38,500 (and, no doubt, getting smaller all the time...)

Pop Culture: Willow's lament that her test scores make her "Cletus, the Slack-Jawed Yokel" refers to a simpleton character in "The Simpsons", who first appeared in the 1994 episode "Bart Gets an Elephant". Cletus is married to his sister, Brandine. They have 26 children and a "smellhound" called Geech. Cletus even got his own theme song in the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield": "Some folks'll never eat a skunk / but then some folks'll / like Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel"!

3ABB09

Ridding Sunnydale of one slimy demon provides little distraction for Buffy, Xander, and Willow, who are still coping with the aftermath of their relationship woes. Cordy is taking it the hardest, ignoring the vast amount of answering machine messages left by Xander while burning all the pictures of her ex-boyfriend.

The next morning, Willow tries once again to patch up her relationship with Oz. Unfortunately, he needs some space and time to make any decisions on the matter. Cordelia arrives at school dressed to kill, but she soon learns that all of her old friends still have no respect for her, even after Xander Harris has left the picture. Harmony introduces Cordy to Anya, a new girl in town, before harshly insulting her former best friend. Anya takes an immediate interest in Cordy's personal troubles. Later that night, Cordy and Anya go to the Bronze, where Xander is also in attendance, along with Buffy and Willow. After getting up to fetch a few drinks, Buffy notices Cordy abruptly exiting, so she follows her into the alley. Before Buffy can get Cordelia to open up and vent her problems, a vampire intervenes. The ensuing fight sends Cordy into a nearby pile of trash. With the last straw exposed, Cordelia identifies Buffy as the source of all of her troubles. As she explains to Anya the next day, none of the bad things in Cordy's life would have ever happened if Buffy never came to Sunnydale. Anya removes her necklace and places it around Cordy's neck. Cordy declares her wish that Buffy never made that fateful trip. At this point, Anya reveals herself to be not quite human and says, "Done." A bright light flashes, and suddenly the Sunnydale High campus is much less crowded than it was a moment ago.

Cordelia quickly realizes that Anya must have granted her wish. However, this new version of Sunnydale is not as ideal as she imagined it would be. There's a city curfew that coincides with sunset. The Bronze is no longer the place to be at night. And Xander and Willow, as Harmony tells her, are dead.

Night falls as Cordelia wanders the deserted streets of Sunnydale. She encounters Xander and tells him that they have to get Buffy. Willow arrives, and Cordy learns that they are now vampires. Before Xander can kill her, a familiar van pulls up to the scene of the inevitable crime. Giles gets out, warding Xander and Willow off with a cross. Behind him, Oz sits in the driver's seat with a crossbow aimed at the vamps. Larry and a girl named Nancy get out of the van and pull Cordy to safety. Giles gets back inside, and the van takes off. Cordelia is brought to the library, which serves as the main base for the resistance against the vampires. Meanwhile, Xander and Willow return to the Bronze, which is now the headquarters for The Master and his minions. The Master orders Xander and Willow to kill Cordelia before she can contact the Slayer and interfere with his latest scheme. Back at the library, Cordy finally comes to and tells Giles about her wish and that they need Buffy. Unfortunately, neither of them realize that Xander and Willow have infiltrated the library. Locked inside the bookcage, Giles can only hopelessly watch as Xander and Willow sink their fangs into Cordelia, draining her of all of her blood. After the vampires leave, Giles uses an axe from his weapons cabinet to bust open the cage. Larry and Oz arrive, informing Giles that Nancy is now dead. As they pick up Cordy's lifeless body to bring to the incinerator, Giles notices her necklace and removes it.

The next morning, Willow plays around with Angel, who the Master has locked up in the basement of the Bronze as punishment. At the library, Giles discovers through his books that the necklace represents Anyanka, the "Patron Saint of Scorned Women". He realizes that Anyanka must have granted a wish that Cordy made which resulted in the world they're living in right now. Giles calls Buffy's Watcher in Cleveland and leaves a message.

While driving down the streets later that night, Giles sees some vampires packing a group of humans into the back of a truck. He wards them off with the cross, enabling the humans to escape. However, he is knocked down from behind. Before the vampires can finish him, another challenger enters the fray. Giles watches the vampires face defeat at the hands of this newcomer, then realizes that this new girl is the one and only Buffy Summers. After taking her back to his apartment, Giles informs her of what he's learned concerning Anyanka. In order to reverse all of her wishes and render her powerless, Anyanka's powercenter must be destroyed. Buffy is clearly uninterested in this, and is more concerned with taking out the Master.

Buffy goes to the Bronze, which is now deserted. In the basement, she finds Angel locked up behind bars. While she doesn't recognize him, Angel knows exactly who she is from all the time he spent secretly observing her in Los Angeles. Angel leads Buffy to a factory where the Master has unveiled a machine that will revolutionize the lifestyle of vampires everywhere. This device can drain a person's body of all of its blood and dispense it into glasses and cups in mere seconds. Buffy and Angel step in to put a stop to the festivities. While Buffy fights the vampires head-on, Angel frees the human prisoners. In the course of the battle, Angel, Xander, and Willow are dusted. While Buffy continues to fight, Giles summons Anyanka and identifies her glowing necklace as her powercenter. As he rips it from her neck and prepares to smash it, the Master overpowers Buffy and snaps her neck, fulfilling the prophecy in the Pergamum Codex in this reality as well. Giles smashes the necklace, and suddenly Cordelia is standing in front of Anya again. Anya realizes that she is no longer able to grant Cordy's wish. As Cordy walks off, she passes by Buffy, Xander, and Willow, who are still alive and well.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

The parallel universe story has a long tradition in telefantasy TV series. In dramatic terms it's a gift to writers: a chance to throw away the rulebook, and an opportunity to explore the kinkier aspects of the series' characters without upsetting established continuity in any lasting way. They also present actors with a golden opportunity to bring new dimensions to characters that they may have been playing for years with little leeway, so it's not surprising that such episodes often end up being fan favourites.

'The Wish' upholds this fine tradition in spades. Before the end of the episode we're offered the return of the Master, vampire versions of Willow and Xander - feasting on Cordelia while Giles watches helplessly, no less - Willow torturing Angel, a cynical, battle scarred Buffy and several regular cast members being killed.

'The Wish' also has another plot device common to most parallel universe stories: fish-out-of-water characters who know that something is amiss (in this case Cordelia and, to a lesser extent, Angel). If all this wish fulfilment wasn't enough, this episode also deals with the fallout from the scene in 'Lover's Walk' where Oz and Cordelia discover Willow and Xander canoodling, (the catalyst for the whole wish scenario).

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

How to trace the history of the parallel universe story? Maybe the first literary example is Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland', which finds Alice in a strange fantasyland populated by characters resembling those that the real Alice knew. (Of course, it could be argued that this is a matter of interpretation, since it's not obvious from an isolated reading of the book). A similar device is used in L.Frank Baum's 1900 story The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

Perhaps the best-known example in cinema is the 1946 classic 'It's a Wonderful Life', which tells the uplifting story of a humble, suicidal man (the wonderful James Stewart) who is shown how the world would have been different if he'd never been born. Many science fiction TV shows have utilised the idea: The 1970 Doctor Who story 'Inferno' saw the Doctor visiting a parallel world where Totalitarianism was rampant. The TV series 'Sliders' used the parallel universe theme. 'Star Trek' has a whole sub-series of parallel universe stories, beginning with the 1967 episode 'Mirror Mirror' and revived and mined for all it was worth by the 90s variant 'Star Trek - Deep Space 9'.

"Take her. Take what you want. Pour all that frustration and all that guilt into her and you will be free." - Jenny Calendar

As Christmas draws near, Angel begins to relive in his dreams the numerous murders he has committed. One of his victims was a young man named Daniel, whom Angel killed in Dublin in 1818. Unable to stay in bed any longer, Angel ventures out onto the streets of Sunnydale and runs into Buffy, who's doing some last-minute Christmas shopping. Angel's attention is soon diverted from Buffy to a familiar face in the distance. Impossible as it may seem, Angel recognizes this person as Daniel, the same man he killed 180 years ago.

After Buffy tells her friends about her encounter with Angel the next day at school, Oz finally decides to give Willow a second chance at their relationship. Later that night, Buffy and Joyce shop for a Christmas tree. While looking around, Joyce suggests that Buffy invite Faith to their place on Christmas Eve. Buffy notices a small group of dead trees that the salesman can't explain. At the motel, Faith turns down Buffy's invitation, explaining that she already has plans to attend a party. Meanwhile, Angel shows up at Giles' doorstep in need of help. Giles invites him in, but not before he grabs a crossbow to protect himself with. Angel wants to find out how and why he returned to Earth, but he is soon distracted by the presence of Jenny Calendar in the apartment. She is invisible to Giles, which adds to his confusion when Angel suddenly runs out the door. Back at the mansion, Angel dreams about another moment in time when he took the life of a servant named Margaret. After drinking her blood, Angel looks up to see Buffy watching the whole event. Angel suddenly wakes up... as does Buffy.

Inside the mansion, Angel is haunted by Jenny, Daniel, Margaret, and visions of his many other victims. Buffy, meanwhile, tells Giles that she shared Angel's dream the previous night. They decide to do some research in hopes of discovering the reason for Angel's return to Earth. Xander and Willow show up shortly to aid in the research. After a while, both Buffy and Angel fall asleep and share another dream in which they make love in Buffy's bedroom. Their romantic moment is interrupted by the vision of a man with no eyes. Before Buffy can figure out what's going on, Angel bites into Buffy's neck, effectively waking both of them up from their slumbers. Angel listens to Jenny as she tries to convince him that losing his soul with Buffy again and killing her will bring him the peace he desires. Giles shows an illustration of three men with no eyes to Buffy, who recognizes the face from her most recent dream. Called the Bringers, or Harbingers, these high priests can summon The First. As Giles explains, The First is the name given to Absolute Evil. Since it is not a physical being, Buffy cannot fight it. Buffy and Xander visit Willy's bar, hoping to get some information on the whereabouts of the Bringers. All they learn is that the Bringers might be underground. Xander decides that they should go home and enjoy Christmas Eve before resuming their search.

With her parents out of town for the evening, Willow invites Oz over to her home to watch a few movies. When Oz arrives, he soon realizes that Willow has made a small change of plans. Willow tells him that she's ready to sleep with him, but Oz knows that she's only doing this as an extreme means of redemption. He turns down Willow's offer, preferring to spend the night in a simpler way, like kissing on the couch. Meanwhile, Faith shows up at the Summers' front porch. Explaining that she thought twice about the party, Faith gives a couple gifts to Buffy and Joyce. While Faith settles in, Buffy goes upstairs to her bedroom to fetch their presents. She is surprised to find Angel in her bedroom. However, he's a little out of it at this point, staring longingly at her neck. Jenny stands behind Buffy, urging Angel to take the final plunge, both symbolically and literally. Angel can't go through with it, and he dives through Buffy's window. Back at the mansion, Angel tells Jenny that he will end his own life, using the deadly rays of the sun to do the deed.

After entrusting Faith with her mother's safety, Buffy goes to Giles' apartment in an attempt to find out where the Bringers are. One of Giles' books contains a passage that indicates the inability of life to grow above or below the Bringers. This leads Buffy back to the suspicious group of dead trees she noticed a while ago. Using an axe, Buffy breaks open a hole in the ground that she immediately enters. Underground, Buffy finds the Bringers and makes short work of them with the axe. However, Buffy isn't prepared to see the figure of Jenny Calendar standing before her. Buffy listens as the vision of Jenny speaks for The First, boasting its legendary might. Buffy has no time to entertain The First, which tells her that Angel will die by sunrise. Buffy runs back to the mansion to find Angel, but he is no longer there. She finally locates him at the top of a hill which overlooks Sunnydale. Buffy tries to get Angel indoors before sunrise, but Angel won't budge. He tells her that he can't go on living, knowing that his very existence presents a threat to the woman he loves so dearly. Buffy refuses to agree, expressing her love for Angel and the self-hatred that goes along with it. Their stand-off is unexpectedly interrupted by several flakes of snow falling from the sky. Soon enough, a steady snowfall envelops Sunnydale for the first time ever, preventing the sun's rays from reaching the ground below and ending Angel's life. Nobody can explain it, but that doesn't matter to Buffy and Angel. Some higher power, whomever or whatever it may be, has given Angel yet another lease on life... on Christmas, no less.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

'Amends' is BtVS' first Christmas episode, (it originally aired in the US on December 15th 1998), so a degree of schmaltz can be forgiven. But even so, chocolate box scenes of snow in Sunnydale are likely to evoke nausea from British audiences for whom inclement weather is a matter of routine.

There's an intriguing idea lurking at the core of 'Amends': Joss's creation of The First, ancient, intangible creatures intent on destruction. Here The First is embodied by a series of 'Christmas Carol'-like spooks, including Jenny Calendar who appears to Buffy and gives her a stark warning: "You think you can fight me? I'm not a demon, little girl. I am something that you can't even conceive. The First Evil. Beyond sin. Beyond death. I am the thing the darkness fears. You'll never see me, but I am everywhere. Every being, every thought, every drop of hate..." It's worth remembering that The First is not defeated here, merely banished by some greater power.

Buffy's rescue of Angel is brilliantly written, acted and directed, but, like the episode itself, it seems to be over all too quickly. The idea that the arrival of snow would somehow prevent the sun rising is somewhat odd, but - hey! - this is Sunnydale, right?

Hey, come on, us in Britain understand totally... cloudy sky, can't see sunlight... - Ed

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

The episode had at least two other titles before Joss settled on 'Amends': 'Old Enemies, Dead Enemies' and 'A Buffy Christmas'.

The 'Mutant Enemy' logo sequence at the end of the credits is given a seasonal twist: the creature is wearing a Santa hat, and there are some jingle bells playing in the background. It's only the second time that it's been changed: the first was at the end of @{"Becoming - Part Two" LINK "BECOMING2"} where, instead of saying "Grrrr...arrrggh!" it said "Oooh, I need a hug!"

Jenny Calendar appears in the series for the second time since being killed by Angel (in @{"Passion" LINK "PASSION"}). The last time she appeared was when Drusilla morphed into her form when trying to get information out of Giles (in @{"Becoming - Part Two" LINK "BECOMING2"}).

Mark Kriski, who appears as the weather forecaster at the end of the episode, is a real-life weatherman, for KTLA in Los Angeles. He's also been in both 'Speed' movies.

On a typical night of patrol and slaying, Buffy's routine is unexpectedly interrupted by the arrival of her mother. Joyce feels that it's time to get a better understanding of her daughter's world by watching Buffy in action. Almost as soon as Joyce arrives, a vampire enters the scene. After Buffy chases him into the thick of the woods, Joyce discovers the bodies of two dead children, one boy and one girl, at a nearby playground. A strange symbol has been enscribed in the palms of their hands. While the police investigate the crime scene, Buffy tries to console her distraught mother.

Buffy tells Giles about the murdered children in the library the next morning. She sketches the symbol she noticed on their palms and shows it to Giles, who believes it implies the handiwork of a cult. Buffy cannot believe that humans are responsible for this as opposed to demons. At lunch, nobody notices Joyce walking into the cafeteria and straight to the gang's table. Buffy excuses herself and takes her mom into the hallway. Joyce tells her daughter that she's organized a meeting at City Hall for that night to discuss the murder.

Dozens of parents attend, including Sheila Rosenberg, Willow's mother. Willow can't believe she's there, considering the fact that they barely communicate with each other. After the Mayor delivers a textbook speech to the crowd, he invites Joyce to the stand to lead them in a moment of silence. Instead, Joyce proposes a call to action, declaring an end to the city's silence concerning the ubiquitous dangers that plague Sunnydale. Later that night, Willow, Amy, and their friend Michael gather together to explore their world of the black arts. On the floor beneath them is the very same symbol that appeared on the two dead children.

At school the next morning, a group of students harass Michael by his locker, stating their belief that witches were responsible for the children's murder. Amy tries to fend them off, but it's Buffy who gets them to back off. Giles finds Buffy and tells her that witches may in fact be the prime suspects. The book that Giles needs to research this further was checked out by Willow, so he asks Buffy to get it for him. Buffy finds Xander sitting in the lounge, who points out Willow's stuff.

As she picks up the book, Buffy notices the symbol drawn on Willow's notebook. She asks Willow to explain it, but their conversation is cut short by the sudden commotion in the hallways. Under Principal Synder's supervision, the local police inspect each and every locker, looking for any signs of materials pertaining to witchcraft. After Amy is escorted to the office, Willow tells Buffy that the symbol is for a protection spell that she wanted to cast for Buffy's upcoming birthday. In other words, the symbol and what it stands for are completely harmless. At that moment, the cops open Willow's locker and ask her to come with them. Buffy runs to the library and discovers a similar scene. As the cops pack up all of Giles' books concerning the supernatural, Buffy tells him about the misleading symbol.

Later that night, Buffy argues with her mother, who is the founder of MOO (Mothers Opposed to the Occult). Buffy insists that this matter be dealt with by the Slayer. However, Joyce doesn't believe that Buffy's work is making Sunnydale any better. After Buffy takes off, the two deceased children appear in the kitchen... very much alive. Joyce listens to them intently as they beg her to make their murderers suffer. Meanwhile, Sheila grounds Willow for getting into trouble at school. She orders her daughter to stay in her room for the rest of the night.

At the park, Angel finds Buffy standing by the scene of the crime, which is now decorated with flowers, candles, and pictures of the children from a time when they were still alive. Buffy has not forgotten her mother's criticism of the Slayer's effectiveness. Angel reassures Buffy that her destiny is not in vain. During their conversation, Angel inadvertently alerts Buffy to a mystery concerning the two children. She heads to the library and finds Giles, Xander, and Oz trying to find any useful information on the internet. Buffy shares her realization that nobody seems to know anything about the two children, including their names or where they came from, and yet their pictures were somehow available for use in MOO's campaign. Oz sends an instant message to Willow, who then begins to search the web for any files or articles relating to the two children. Apparently, the dead bodies of these same two children have been repeatedly discovered once every fifty years, dating all the way back to 1649. The oldest article identifies them as Hans and Greta Strauss.

Unfortunately, Sheila cuts off Willow's computer access at this moment, forcing Giles and the gang to figure the rest out on their own. Giles recalls a theory that many fairy tales are based on actual accounts of the supernatural. Buffy fills in the blanks, recalling the story of Hansel and Gretel, who must have been based on Hans and Greta. Suddenly, Michael bursts into the library and tells everybody that he was attacked by his own family. He also informs them that Amy was taken from her home. Xander and Oz head towards Willow's house while Buffy and Giles race back to the Summers home to warn everybody. Back at the Rosenberg's, Willow answers the knocking at her door and finds her mother... along with a group of angry parents who want nothing but her death. Meanwhile, Buffy and Giles interrupt another MOO meeting. As they take Joyce into the foyer to speak with her alone, the rest of the group sneak up from behind and knock Giles unconscious. Joyce does the same to Buffy with the help of some chloroform.

Buffy, Willow, and Amy are tied to large stakes in City Hall, ready to be burned for the crimes they've been accused of. Willow and Amy unsuccessfully struggle with their restraints, while Buffy remains unconscious. Meanwhile, Xander and Oz burst into Willow's room, which was left a total mess in the wake of the angry parents. As they leave for City Hall, Giles is awoken by an impatient Cordelia, who came to the house to find out what was going on. They hurry to Giles' car and speed towards City Hall. During the drive, Giles has Cordy mix together the ingredients for a spell while he tries to recall the incantation from memory. Back at City Hall, Buffy finally regains consciousness and realizes the situation she's in. Joyce refuses to listen to her daughter's pleas. Amy escapes danger by transforming herself into a rat and bolting out of the room, but Willow and Buffy are still moments away from a fiery death. Just as the fire is about to engulf Buffy and Willow, Giles and Cordy burst into the room. While Cordy extinguishes the fire, Giles casts the spell on the two children, who then combine and change into the true form of a tall, hideous demon. As the parents realize the deception and try to escape, Xander and Oz approach the scene via a ventilation shaft above the ceiling. Without the help of the parents, the demon attempts to kill Buffy and Willow directly and charges them. Buffy breaks the stake she's been tied to in half and leans forward - just in time to impale the demon. The silence that follows is soon interrupted by the sight and sound of Xander and Oz falling down through a weak spot in the ceiling and crashing down onto the floor.

A while after their near-death experience, Buffy and Willow discuss Sheila Rosenberg's convenient memory loss concerning the demon, just like the way Joyce Summers' memory used to operate before learning that her daughter was the Slayer. Willow then makes another attempt at restoring the Amy rat to human form. Unfortunately, Willow is going to need a little more practice before she can pull this one off.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

The pacing of this episode is almost perfect, slowly building an uncomfortable atmosphere of intolerance and hatred. This bubbles over into bullying, overzealous state intervention and ultimately, into mob rule. It's a chilling scenario, made more intense by seeing how the series' most sympathetic and innocent character, Willow, is caught up in wild - if not entirely unfounded - accusations of witchcraft.

The episode regularly strikes a sensitive nerve. The restriction of personal liberties ("Oh man, it's Nazi Germany and I've got Playboys in my locker!"), the formation of vigilante groups ("Mothers Opposed to the Occult...a powerful new group") and the confiscation of books ("He'll get most of them back") provides plenty of dramatic potential, and, given a unique "BtVS" twist, forms the backbone for a fascinating story.

Jane Espensen's script consistently strikes the right tone, coating events with a veneer of humour (The 'MOO' acronym, Xander's Playboy stash and Sheila Rosenberg's reference to 'Bunny' Summers) that prevents the episode from slipping into darker territory. The tense finale, where Buffy, Willow and Amy are tied to stakes and threatened with being burnt as witches, is beautifully staged and directed. In an especially neat touch the pyre is made up of the contents of Giles' library, combining book burning with cruel and unusual punishment. Only the annoying and unnecessary addition of Willow's mother adds a sour note to an otherwise almost perfect episode.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

The Hansel and Gretel story as we know it now first appeared in Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's collection of fairy tales, published between 1812 and 1815. However, Grimm's stories were based on folk tales that had previously been perpetuated by oral storytelling traditions. In 'Gingerbread' the first occurrence of the myth is traced specifically to 1649, but this seems to be where the facts and 'BtVS' version of events part company...

Pop culture 1: Snyder's gleeful "I love the smell of desperate librarian in the morning" is an adaptation of a famous line from Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Vietnam war movie 'Apocalypse Now', in which a hyped-up Lieutenant Colonel (played by Robert Duvall) is supervising an air raid on the Vietcong: "I love the smell of napalm in the morning".

Pop culture 2: Willow and her mother discuss the 'Mister Rogers' puppet show, and one of the show's characters, King Friday. This is a reference to 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood', an educational children's show - and something of an American institution - that has been running since 1965.

"I don't know you." - Buffy

After a training session in the mansion, Buffy and Angel get a little too close for comfort. With her eighteenth birthday almost upon her, Buffy is anxiously awaiting to spend some time with her father at an ice show. Later, at the library, Giles leads Buffy through a study of vibratory stones. Despite being a little fidgety, Buffy manages to concentrate on one of the stones. Afterwards, Buffy battles with a vampire in the park. Just as she is about to deliver the final blow, something surges through Buffy's body, and she suddenly finds herself powerless. The vampire quickly takes the upper hand, knocking her to the ground and turning the wooden stake on the Slayer herself. Buffy panicks, but she is still able to stun the vampire with a headbutt and push him off of her. She grabs the stake and aims it straight up as the vampire leaps onto her. In an instant, the vampire is nothing but dust.

Giles enters the library the next morning to find Buffy practicing her aim with throwing knives. As the random placing of the knives on and around the target shows, the Slayer is not her usual self. Giles ensures Buffy that she'll be okay. Outside, Buffy downplays her friends' enthusiasm over the upcoming birthday, suggesting that a party may not be the greatest of ideas, given her tainted history with such social gatherings. Later that night, Buffy notices a birthday balloon floating in her kitchen with what appear to be an envelope and tickets attached to the string. As Joyce informs her that Hank won't be able to free up enough time to take her to the ice show, Buffy folds up the envelope without even opening it.

Meanwhile, three men are hard at work inside an old, abandoned boarding house. One of the men, Quentin Travers, looks on as his two associates, Blair and Hobson, work on laying bricks in several of the doorways. At the library, Buffy tries to indirectly ask Giles to take her to the ice show, but he is more interested in making her study the vibratory stones. After Buffy finally gives up her futile effort, Giles instructs her to concentrate on the fault inside the large blue stone. As Buffy stares at it, she suddenly loses all touch with the outside world. Giles checks to make sure Buffy's in a trance, then takes an injection kit out of his bag. He injects a strange, green fluid into Buffy's arm. After he finishes the task and puts away the kit, Giles waves his hand in front of the fault, breaking Buffy's trance. Unaware of what just happened, Buffy decides to call it a night and leaves Giles alone in the library.

Outside of school the next morning, Buffy notices a guy harassing Cordelia. Buffy walks up to the guy and grabs him by the arm. However, she suddenly realizes that she doesn't have enough strength to do anything to the guy, who casually shoves her to the ground with that one arm. Buffy finds Giles in the hallway and tells him about her disturbing loss of strength. Giles doesn't show a great deal of concern, although he definitely knows why Buffy is going through this. Giles speaks with Quentin at the boarding house, voicing his disagreement with the Watcher Council's insistence on subjecting Buffy to the Cruciamentum. The Cruciamentum is a test which all Slayers must endure when they reach the age of eighteen in order to prove their instinctual skills and resourcefulness. To do so, the Slayer must survive an encounter with a vicious vampire while trapped inside a small space. In this case, Buffy must defeat an insane vampire, Zackary Kralik, in the confines of this boarding house. After Giles leaves, a loud, painful scream emanates from Kralik's coffin. Blair and Hobson open the coffin and give Kralik his pills. Giles returns to the library, where Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Oz try to find any relevant info in the books that might explain her loss of power. While Buffy continues to search for answers, Kralik's screaming keeps Blair and Hobson from getting any rest. While Hobson takes a break, Blair opens the coffin to learn that Kralik wants more pills. As Blair goes to the kitchen to fill the glass with water, Kralik screams to cover up the sound of his straightjacket ripping at the seams. Kralik then tricks Blair into stepping close to the coffin and grabs him by the throat with his freed arm before sinking his fangs into his neck. At the mansion, Angel gives a book of poetry to Buffy for her birthday. Unfortunately, Buffy is distracted by her power loss to fully appreciate Angel's gift. Buffy fears that she may have lost what made her special. Angel consoles her by confessing that he watched her long before she moved to Sunnydale, admitting that he loved her then every bit as much as he does now. Meanwhile, Blair rises in front of Kralik as a newly-turned vampire. He picks up an axe and frees Kralik from his restraints.

Giles stops by the boarding house to check in on things, but nobody seems to be around. After noticing blood on the stairway railing, Giles grabs a make-shift stake and opens Kralik's tomb. Finding it empty, Giles goes to the kitchen and discovers Hobson's dead corpse. Overcome by the grotesque sight and smell, Giles runs out of the house. He needs to find Buffy, who is walking the streets alone. She runs into Kralik, who grabs her jacket. Unable to fight him as she normally would, Buffy turns and runs for her life. She tries to climb over, then under a fence. Blair shows up and tries to pull her back, but Buffy escapes and runs out into the middle of the street. Giles arrives just in time, and Buffy jumps into his car. Back at the library, Giles tells the whole truth to Buffy, showing her the syringe filled with an organic compound of muscle relaxants and adrenal suppressers. He informs her that the effects of the compound will wear off in a few days, but Buffy is too furious to care about that right now. Giles goes on to tell her that he just invalidated the test by telling her about it ahead of time. Unfortunately, Buffy refuses to listen or forgive him. As soon as Cordelia walks into the library to do some research for a paper, Buffy asks her for a ride home. While Cordelia drives Buffy home, Joyce hears a noise on her front porch. She goes out and sees Buffy's jacket draped over a figure. Assuming it's Buffy, she bends down towards the covered figure. However, it's not Buffy at all, but really Kralik. When Buffy arrives home, she finds a polaroid of her mother and Kralik. She packs a large amount of her slaying supplies into her bag and heads towards the mansion. Tied to a chair and gagged, Joyce can do nothing but watch as Kralik takes countless polaroids of her while rambling about his hatred for mothers. Buffy walks in through the main entrance of the boarding house and looks around. As she realizes that all of the other exits have been sealed by bricks, Blair locks the main entrance, trapping the Slayer inside.

Meanwhile, Quentin visits Giles at the library and tells him that the Cruciamentum has begun. Giles informs him that he disclosed all of the information concerning the test, but none of that matters right now. He leaves Quentin in the library and races towards the boarding house. Buffy encounters Kralik and tries to take him out with her crossbow, but it's no use. He chases Buffy through the house. She takes refuge inside a dark room. When she turns the light on, Buffy sees that the walls are completely plastered with photos of her helpless mother. She runs out of the room, and Kralik finally traps her in the hallway. Buffy attempts to ward him off with a cross, but Kralik is so insane that he actually enjoys the pain it causes. Before he can bite into her neck, Kralik is suddenly seized by his painful need to take his pills. He fishes the medicine bottle out of his pocket. Spotting an opportunity, Buffy grabs the bottle out of his hands and dives through a laundry chute.

Landing in the basement, Buffy finds Joyce on the chair. When Kralik reaches the basement, Buffy tries to flee the scene with his pills. He rips the bottle out of her hands and quickly grabs the nearby glass of water. After swallowing the pills with the water, Kralik suddenly notices a burning sensation inside himself. Buffy holds out an empty bottle of Holy Water. The blessed water soon disintegrates Kralik. As Buffy works on freeing Joyce from the chair, both Giles and Blair crash into the basement. Giles finishes the vampire off, then leaves with Joyce and Buffy.

In the library, Quentin commends Buffy on her successful passing of the test. However, he has bad news for Giles. Since he has demonstrated a relationship with Buffy that the Council has deemed too close, like the way a father loves his daughter, Giles is relieved of his duties as Buffy's Watcher. Quentin then tells Buffy that she will be assigned a new Watcher soon. Struck by this revelation of how much Giles cares for her, Buffy calmly allows him to tend to her wounds. Back at home, Buffy's friends try to make sense of Giles' being fired... especially Willow, who almost refuses to believe the mere possibility of Giles losing his job.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

We all fear the diminishment or loss of our faculties, but Buffy, who relies on hers not only to carry out her responsibilities but also to keep her alive, must fear it most acutely. That's the basis for David Fury's story, which also tests the limits of Buffy's increasingly father-daughter relationship with Giles in some heart-wrenching scenes. To put it bluntly, Giles betrays Buffy in this episode, and seriously endangers the life of his charge in order to placate the Council.

There's little logic in the premise for the test - what would happen if the slayer was killed? Would that mean that they weren't capable of doing the job? Little wonder that Giles has a change of heart about what he calls "an archaic exercise in cruelty" and decides to disobey the Council's orders, although it does raise the question as to why it took him so long! Surely this points to a character flaw in the watcher, not the slayer? This story would have been far more interesting if Faith had been around to stir things up. After a couple of episodes without her - and with no adequate explanation for her absence (sorry, but "unannounced walkabout" just doesn't cut it) - the series seems to be drifting rather aimlessly.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Zackary Kralik was played by an actor with some experience of being a vampire: Jeff Corber appeared in Fox's short-lived 1996 series 'Kindred: The Embraced'.

This episode marks Buffy's eighteenth birthday, explaining the original title of this episode: "Eighteen".

There are several allusions to the Red Riding Hood story, notably Kralik's line 'Why did you come to the dark of the woods - to bring all these sweets to grandmother's house?' and Buffy's red coat (which Kralik uses to hide in - as the wolf in the story used Grandma's clothes).

Buffy's love of ice-skating was an idea introduced in 'What's My Line - Part I'. Her line 'Brian Boitano doing 'Carmen' is a life changer' refers to the American 1988 Olympic gold medallist skater. Boitano has a song devoted to him in 'South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut'.

@{b}Chris's Notes@{ub}

It seems that halfway into the third season, Buffy the Vampire Slayer has entered another one of its dark(er) patches. The Buffy team follow up last week's story, where Mothers Opposed to the Occult decide to burn the town's Wiccan population, with a storyline which sees Buffy lose all faith in Giles, followed by Giles being relieved of his watcher duties. Also, while @{"Gingerbread" LINK "GINGERBREAD"} makes use of classic Buffy humour to brighten the episode's tone slightly, there isn't much of this evident during 'Helpless' until Kralik's death. Even then, Giles' redundancy (though it should be noted, he is of course still the school's librarian) hangs like a rather dark cloud over the Scooby Gang.

"Cordelia, feel free to drop dead of a wasting disease in the next 20 seconds." - Xander

Combining their unique talents and efforts, Giles, Willow, Faith, and Buffy defeat a group of hideous, female demons. Xander, however, can only pick himself up from the ground and commend his partners on a job well done. The others agree that Xander should not be risking his life by constantly involving himself in the battles. Of course, Xander just doesn't want to be left out of the fun.

Outside of school the next morning, Xander accidentally upsets Jack O'Toole, the local psychopath. After successfully escaping the wrath of Jack, Xander runs into Cordelia. She delights in pointing out Xander's insignificance, seeing how all of his friends possess one special quality that makes them fit in. Xander, on the other hand, has nothing to warrant his involvement in the Slayer circle. Inside the library, Giles unloads some bad news on Buffy. Apparently, the demons they fought the previous night belong to an Apocalypse cult called the Sisterhood of Jhe. They intend to reopen the Hellmouth, and there's no telling how soon that event will occur. As for Xander, his main problem concerns finding a special "thing" to help him fit in. The only "thing" that Xander can come up with is a car, which he procures from his Uncle Roary. Unfortunately, this brings little joy to Buffy and Willow, who are preoccupied with the Sisterhood of Jhe's plan. Xander offers to help, which only leads him to the local bakery to pick up some doughnuts. Outside the shop, a beautiful woman by the name of Lysette admires Xander's car. Dumbfounded by his luck, Xander offers to give her a ride. Their impromptu date soon becomes an abyss of boredom for Xander, who learns that Lysette's one and only interest is cars. When Angel enters the Bronze, Xander immediately showers him with warm greetings, desperately in need of an escape from his personal hell. Angel doesn't have time to help Xander, for he's more intent on finding Buffy and warning her about the upcoming danger, and says Xander should stay out of danger. Buffy and Willow, meanwhile, come up empty-handed in the research department. Unable to find anybody on the Watcher Council willing to listen to him, Giles heads to the cemetery to contact the spirit guides for any help. Buffy goes to Willy's bar later, only to find the place trashed and the bartender bleeding on the floor. Willy warns Buffy that the Hellmouth will be opened before sunrise.

Upon leaving the Bronze, Xander has another run-in with Jack. This time, he carelessly crashes his car into another, from which Jack O'Toole emerges. Just before Jack ends Xander's all-too-short life with a really big knife, a police officer shows up. Instead of turning Jack in, Xander tells the cop that everything's fine. The officer appears to be less than convinced but leaves them to it. Impressed by this surprising turn of events, Jack invites Xander to hang out with him and his friends. Back in his car, Xander drives Jack and Lysette to the cemetery where they're supposed to meet up with Jack's friends. Unbeknownst to Xander and Lysette, Jack's friends have a slight case of death. Lysette screams and runs for her life after Jack uses a ritual to raise one of his friends, Bob, from his grave. While Jack raises two more guys, Xander spots Giles, who was unable to get any answers from the spirit guides. Xander offers his help again, but Giles advises him to stay out of it. Xander's new "friends" appoint him as their designated driver, then have him drive them to the hardware store. While they break in and loot the place, Xander sees Willow emerging from a magic shop with a bag full of ingredients.

Once again, he asks if the gang needs any help, but Willow doesn't tell him what he wants to hear. After she leaves, Jack and his friends decide to initiate Xander into their group. However, the sole requirement for initiation is Xander's death. Xander argues that Jack isn't dead, who then proves him wrong by revealing the bullet holes in his abdomen. Fed up with this party, Xander makes a run for it, eluding the zombies quickly enough to get back in his car and speed away. After a short drive, Xander sees Faith battling another Sisterhood of Jhe member. Flooring the gas pedal, Xander rams his car into the demon, then takes off with Faith. They take refuge in her motel room, where Xander discovers that his night isn't over by a long shot. The victory-less battle has left Faith all worked up, and the only thing that can relax her is a physical encounter of a completely different kind. After relocation Faith shoulder and shedding their clothes, Faith does the deed with Xander in bed... then kicks him out of the place as soon as they finish.

Xander notices that the bags left in the back seat of his car contain ingredients for a bomb. He speeds back to the hardware store to Jack and the zombie gang, but they're are long gone. Unsure of what to do next, he seeks out Buffy for help. Xander finds her at the mansion with Angel. Xander senses he's interrupted something, so he leaves them alone to take care of matters by himself. Meanwhile, Willow relocates werewolf Oz, who broke out of his cage earlier and had to be tranquilized, to a safer part of the school. She then returns to the library to help Giles prepare a binding spell which might take care of the Hellmouth demon. Neither of them are aware of the four zombies in the boiler room beneath them.

Jack's gang puts the finishing touches on the bomb and leaves. Xander sees them walking down the street. Needing answers fast, he pulls up between them and grabs one of the zombies before hitting the gas. He learns that the bomb is in the boiler room of Sunnydale High. Before Xander can get the info he needs to disarm the bomb, the zombie's head connects with a mailbox and instantaneously departs from its body. Xander reaches the school and runs inside, completely unaware that the rest of his friends are in a life-and-death battle with the Hellmouth demon in the library... again. The zombies pursue Xander, who succeeds in taking them out one by one. In the boiler room, Xander encounters a knife-wielding Jack, while the bomb timer reads two minutes and counting. Xander dares Jack to let the bomb explode and permanently end his days as one of the walking dead. Jack's not ready to give up his lifestyle just yet, so he disarms the bomb just as it's about to detonate. Xander leaves the boiler room, confident that Jack won't be bothering him anymore. He's proved right, because Jack opens another exit only to have a fatal encounter with werewolf Oz.

The next morning, Buffy, Willow, and Giles look back on their epic battle, while Oz tries to figure out why he's so full. Cordelia makes her usual fun of Xander, but he walks away, happy that now he has a better outlook on his role in the grand scheme of things.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}Notes@{ub}

Somewhere in Sunnydale something very important is happening; something that may even bring about the end of the world. The Hellmouth is opening again, and this time Xander isn't invited. Instead of focussing on this seemingly pivotal event, (one which would form the backbone for any standard episode), we are treated to a parallel story, and granted a significant insight into Xander's character. The Hellmouth story is almost entirely incidental, and the episode may have been more powerful if Xander was the only person having an unusual evening.

The problem is that this episode seems to focus on Xander a little too much, considering the implications of the Sisterhood of Jhe's plans ("This is worse than anything we've ever faced"). Buffy and the gang don't get enough screentime, and it feels odd to see them so bruised and battered at the end when their battle seemed all along to be a sub-plot. It's difficult to tell how the Hellmouth was closed up again, but judging by their conversation, Giles was the hero of the day. Perhaps this serves to remind us of how Buffy and company are in real danger every day.

As Cordelia, ever watchful for a back to stick a knife into, is quick to point out, Xander has been neglected of late, and lacks the special talents granted to his colleagues. (Note, though, that Cordelia conveniently forgets to include herself in her vindictive outburst!) It's interesting to note that it's not merely Xander's ability to handle Jack O'Toole and his zombie pals that's being tested: it's his ability to handle them on his own. Several times during the night Xander encounters friends who would be able to help him, (Giles at the Restfield Cemetery, Willow outside the magic store and Faith after her battle with one of the Jhe demons). He has plenty of opportunity to ask for assistance, but he doesn't, and his character grows stronger because of it. Of course, during his hot and sweaty tussle with Faith he probably had other things on his mind...

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

'The Zeppo' draws its title from one of the four Marx Brothers, a group of irreverent comedians who were huge stars during the 1930s. Herbert "Zeppo" Marx was the group's straight man, the foil for much of his elder brothers' anarchic humour. Hence to be "the Zeppo" is to be the least important member of a group.

Pop Culture: The episode is littered with references, including nods to the 1982 Michael Jackson song 'Wanna Be Starting Something' (on his best-selling 'Thriller' album) and Chuck Norris's CBS TV series 'Walker Texas Ranger'.

There are two references to the 'Superman' comic strip, TV series and movies: Xander's line "But, gee, Mr White, if Clark and Lois get all the good stories I'll never be a good reporter", which he acknowledges as a "Jimmy Olsen joke", name-checks the Daily Planet's editor Perry White, Superman's alter ego Clark Kent, and his colleague Lois Lane. Cordelia's jibe "You must feel like Jimmy Olsen" is another reference to the Daily Planet's bumbling cub photographer.

Acronym alert! 'DUI' stands for 'Driving Under the Influence': something you can be charged with if, like Xander's uncle Rory, you drink and drive. Xander's uncle Rory is constantly referred to in the show, but doesn't appear until Xander's wedding in @{"Hell's Bells" LINK "HELLBELLS"}.

If you liked this episode, check out Martin Scorsese's neglected 1985 black comedy 'After Hours', about a young man who finds himself at the centre of a series of nightmarish events after befriending a young woman he meets in a restaurant.

"Slayer, you think you've won. When he rises, you'll wish I'd killed you all..." - Balthazar

During a typical night of patrolling and slaying vampires, Buffy and Faith encounter a not-so-typical vampire wielding a pair of swords. They successfully reduce the vamp to dust, but Buffy and Faith soon realize that the two swords are nowhere to be seen. The swords have, in fact, been brought to Mayor Wilkins' office by Mr. Trick. After looking them over, Mayor reminds Mr. Trick and his deputy mayor, Allan Finch, of the upcoming dedication and the hundred days which will ultimately lead to the ascension, and that nothing can interfere with it. The next morning, in the school lounge, Willow proudly shows her early admittance packets from several big-name universities to her friends. Meanwhile, Giles listens as Buffy's new watcher boast pathetically that he's faced two vampires himself, "under controlled circumstances, of course." Buffy arrives, and the new watcher introduces himself to her as Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. Buffy says very little except to ask Giles if the new watcher is evil.

When asked about the previous night's patrol, Buffy describes the vampire packing the two swords. Wesley scans through his books and quickly locates some information on a fifteenth-century duelist cult called El Eliminati. They once worked for Balthazar, an ancient demon, before he was apparently killed. In order to explain their current presence in Sunnydale, Wesley theorizes that they may be looking for an amulet that has been hidden in the Gleaves family crypt. Just then, Faith arrives, meets Wesley, then immediately turns and leaves ("Screw that!"). After Buffy catches up with her, Faith tells her that they don't have to follow their new Watcher's orders. Later that night, Buffy searches through the tombs inside the Gleaves crypt. Just as she locates the amulet, she hears several voices approaching from outside. As Buffy hides in one of the other tombs, the Eliminati vampires enter the crypt and take the amulet. After they leave, Buffy gets out of the tomb and is shocked by Faith's unexpected arrival. They go after the vampires, following them underground. In the course of the battle, one of the vampires attempts to drown Buffy in a pool of water. Thinking he has succeeded, he releases his grip, giving Buffy all the opportunity she needs to spring back to her feet ("I hate it when they drown me!") and take the amulet back from the vampires.

The next day in the library, Wesley inspects the amulet while Buffy heads to her chemistry class to take a test. The chem teacher, Mrs. Taggert, leaves her students alone in the classroom, expecting them to follow the honor system. Faith appears outside one of the windows and draws a heart with a stake piercing it, signaling Buffy's early departure. Willow and Xander try to keep their friend from leaving, but Buffy is gone in no time. Faith leads Buffy to a vampire nest, where they give the sleeping demons a rather rude wake-up call. Spirits high, Buffy and Faith head to the Bronze afterwards and tear up the dance floor. Angel arrives and pulls Buffy aside to warn her that Balthazar is still alive.

When Wesley appears on the scene, Buffy takes the amulet from him and gives it to Angel for safe keeping. Later, at an abandoned warehouse, the Eliminati vampires listen to their master, Balthazar, who is a horrendously bloated demon sitting in a pool of water. Upset with one of his minions, Balthazar uses telekinesis to draw the vampire's helpless body closer. Balthazar then crushes the vampire's skull with his own two hands. Balthazar gives orders to his head minion, Vincent. Outside, Buffy and Faith spy on the gathering. In need of weaponry, Faith spots a hunting equipment shop that's closed for the night. Buffy follows as Faith breaks into the shop and proceeds to destroy some display cases containing weapons. Taking Faith's lead, Buffy obtains a dagger for herself. However, their shoplifting spree is cut short by a pair of cops with guns drawn. During the drive back to the police station, Faith talks Buffy into helping her kick the cage into the driver and his partner, causing the car to crash and enable their escape.

The next morning, Buffy checks the newspaper to see if her run-in with the law is mentioned anywhere. Apparently it isn't. Meanwhile, Mayor Wilkins is attacked by Vincent in his own office. After Mr. Trick knocks the vampire out cold, Mayor Wilkins wonders how the vampire slipped past security. Instead of having the vampire killed, Mayor Wilkins orders Mr. Trick to lock him up. Later, Willow is disappointed to learn that Buffy's schedule doesn't include her. Faith arrives shortly to pick up Buffy, leaving Willow alone. At Giles' office, Wesley criticizes the former Watcher for his job performance with Buffy. Their argument doesn't go very far before Giles notices the sudden presence of several vampires outside the office. Elsewhere, Buffy and Faith head to the warehouse to take out Balthazar and his minions. On the way, they encounter several vampires and dust them, one by one. When a hand reaches out and grabs Buffy, Faith throws the guy against a dumpster and drives her stake towards his heart. Buffy realizes that this is no vampire, but it's too late as Faith's stake plunges into the heart of Deputy Mayor Allan Finch. Within seconds, Finch is dead.

Deciding to flee from the scene, Faith and Buffy split up. Buffy runs into Angel, who notices the blood on her hands. They head towards the warehouse, where Giles and Wesley have been brought before the demon Balthazar. Wesley attempts to save his own neck by offering the man who has the amulet to Balthazar. Before any more information can be spilled, Angel and Buffy arrive and battle the vampires. Frustrated, Balthazar uses his telekinesis to bring Angel into his own hands. Thinking quick, Buffy spots a lamp hovering above the pool. She sends it falling into the water, electrocuting the obese demon. With his last breath, Balthazar warns Buffy that a greater enemy's ascension is at hand. While Buffy and the others puzzle over the meaning of Balthazar's dying words, Mayor Wilkins, kneeling in the centre of a pentagram, performs the dedication ritual in his office. After completing it, he orders Mr. Trick to release Vincent from his cage. Once freed, Vincent takes the sword and cleaves the mayor's head into two halves. Vincent then watches in shock as Mayor Wilkins' head reforms itself. Vincent steps back, and Mr. Trick takes his cue, driving a stake into his heart. Mayor Wilkins is now invincible, and he will remain so for the hundred days leading to his ascension.

Buffy visits Faith's motel room the next morning to discuss their crime. Disturbed by Faith's apparent lack of guilt, Buffy tries to convince her that the victim's body will be found eventually. Faith tells Buffy that she returned to the scene of the crime and dumped the body.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

If you've ever stopped to ponder the ethics of what Buffy does - slaying sentient beings, and even the occasional detour into genocide - then "Bad Girls" should give you plenty of food for thought. Throughout this episode Buffy fails to recognise the warning signs being broadcast by Faith, (discussions about how killing gives her a thrill - "tell me you don't get off on this" - and her reckless attack on Balthazar's El Eliminati acolytes), eventually resulting in the death of Alan, the deputy mayor.

His death, a tragic accident that Faith initially seems very disturbed about, is the catalyst that finally allows her to shed her last vestiges of responsibility. What's more tantalising is that Buffy very nearly follows her, a point well made by author Douglas Petrie in what's essentially the first part of a two-episode story. Had Alan not died, how long would it have been before Buffy was just like Faith?

Alan's death is a very powerful scene, and one that signals a fundamental change to a more mature series. With such an important A-story, it's surprising that the Balthazar plot is not underdeveloped, partly because it allows space for the introduction of Wesley, the naïve new Watcher. Alexis Denisof's scenes with Anthony Stewart Head provide wonderful counterpoint to the more grisly aspects of the drama.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

The piece of music playing in the Bronze, as Faith and Buffy party after their attack on El Eliminati base is 'Chinese Burn', by British group Curve, a 1997 single from their album 'Come Clean'. If it seems naggingly familiar, it's probably because Sony used it for a long-running advert for the Minidisc format.

Pop culture #1: There are several references to American newspaper comic strips that British viewers might find puzzling: 'Family Circus' is a cosy strip that's been running for forty years, and is carried by 1,500 newspapers worldwide; 'Marmaduke' is the name of a dog in a strip that's been around since 1954; 'Cathy' refers to a relative newcomer, a strip about a single mother that debuted in 1976.

Pop Culture #2: 'Let Captain Courageous here go, and I'll tell you what you need to know' contains an appropriate reference coming from the scholarly Giles: 'Captains Courageous' is the title of an 1897 novel written by Indian writer Rudyard Kipling. The book, about a wealthy young boy who falls off an ocean liner, only to be rescued by Portuguese fishermen, has been filmed several times, most notably in 1937. Not to be missed is the appearance of the young Mickey Rooney with a squeeze box.

Do Wesley's "three key words for any Slayer: preparation, preparation, preparation" remind you of a certain Prime Minister's 'education, education, education'? (A bit before my time - Ed)

3ABB15

Buffy has a nightmare in which she tries to escape the murky water while the murdered Finch pulls her down by the ankle. Finally reaching the surface, Buffy sees Faith, who immediately pushes her fellow Slayer back underwater. After waking up, Buffy wanders down to the family room, where her mother is watching a news report about the discovery of Finch's body.

At the library, Wesley orders Buffy and Faith to investigate Finch's murder. During their discussion, Cordelia enters the library to check out some books for an assignment. She takes an immediate interest in Wesley, who doesn't realize how old she really is until Giles and the others fill him in. After heading out, Buffy tries to convince Faith into coming clean and confessing their crime. Faith reminds Buffy that they were both involved, so if she goes down, she's taking Buffy with her. Buffy then spots Willow and tries to talk to her. However, Willow is still stung by Buffy's recent behaviour. Meanwhile, Mayor Wilkins shreds all of Finch's files that contain anything related to their dirty work. Mr. Trick listens as Mayor Wilkins wonders if Allan Finch was conspiring against him somehow.

Later that night, Buffy and Faith sneak into Finch's office at City Hall to see if they can find any info that might explain why he was in the alley that night. Buffy suggests that Allan might have been looking for them. They notice that almost all of his files are gone, which leads Buffy to believe that a cover-up may be in the works. Just as they're heading out, Mayor Wilkins and Mr. Trick enter the building on the opposite end of the hallway. Seeing them together, Buffy and Faith duck back into Finch's office, waiting for the Mayor and Mr. Trick to pass by before running for the exit.

Outside, Buffy expresses her concern over Faith's apparently guilt-free conscience. She doesn't believe that Faith is perfectly okay with murdering a man, but Faith says otherwise. Faith believes that their nightly deeds as Slayers should put them above the law. When Buffy returns home, she is greeted by her mother and Detective Stein, who has come to ask her a few questions about the night of the murder. Buffy lies and pleads ignorance to everything related to the murder. Detective Stein leaves and visits Faith at her motel room, where he gets a similar story. Meanwhile, a tearful Buffy tells Willow the truth about everything that happened. Willow advises Buffy to go to Giles. When Buffy arrives at the library, she finds out that Faith has gotten there first and pinned the murder on Buffy. Buffy tries to convince Giles otherwise, but he sends her to his office to deal with her later. After Faith goes home, Giles assures Buffy that he's aware of Faith's lies. While Giles tells Buffy that he has no intentions of involving the Watcher's Council in this matter, Wesley overhears the whole conversation from outside the office. Soon afterwards, he calls the Council in Britain to alert them of the crime.

The next morning, Buffy talks with Xander, Willow, and Giles about what they should do with Faith. Feeling he has a special connection with Faith ever since the night they slept together, Xander volunteers to talk to her. In no time, Buffy, Willow, and Giles figure out what happened between the two of them. While Xander heads towards Faith's motel room, Willow cries in a toilet cubicle over the revelation that her first love has had sex with another girl. At the motel room, Xander tries to help Faith see that what she did was wrong. With no intentions of hearing any more of this, Faith shoves Xander onto the bed and jumps on top of him. Unlike last time, however, Faith's desires are much deadlier. She wraps her hands around Xander's neck and tries to squeeze the life out of him. Before she can kill him, Faith is distracted by a sound at her doorway. She turns her head just in time to see Angel swing a bat right into her face.

Later, Faith regains consciousness in the mansion. Noticing that she's all chained up, Faith tries to come on to Angel. He leaves her there alone momentarily while he goes to talk with Buffy in another room. Angel believes that Faith is more dangerous than ever, now that she's experienced murder by her own hands. After Buffy leaves to patrol, Angel returns to the main chamber to talk to Faith. He tells her how he can relate to her sinful desires. Unfortunately, Faith has no interest in his attempts to help her. Suddenly, Wesley and several other men crash into the mansion. The men subdue Angel while Wesley unlocks Faith's chains. Immediately after unlocking the last chain, Wesley restrains Faith with his own cuffs, informing the Slayer that she will be brought to Britain to face the Council. In the truck, Faith tricks one of the men into getting closer. She then beats him to the ground and threatens to snap his neck unless Wesley frees her from the restraints. Wesley follows her orders. As soon as she's freed, Faith knocks Wesley to the floor and jumps out the back of the truck.

Buffy returns to the mansion to find Faith gone and Angel immobilized on the floor. Shortly, Giles, Xander, and Willow arrive at the mansion. When they try to formulate a plan to save Faith, Willow interrupts with her own objection to the idea of saving a guilty murderer who has just tried to kill Xander. At that moment, a bruised Wesley arrives at the mansion and tells them that Faith has escaped. Having an idea of where she might be, Buffy goes to the docks. Sure enough, Faith is on one of the boats, ready to flee the country. Buffy tries one last time to turn Faith around and get help. They argue again, but this debate is cut short by a surprise ambush. Mr. Trick and several of his vampire cohorts knock Buffy to the ground with a large crate. With Buffy down for the moment, Faith attempts to fight the vampires by herself. As Buffy recovers, Mr. Trick takes advantage of her weakened state to try and kill her once and for all. After dusting the last of the vampire henchmen, Faith sees Mr. Trick about to bite into Buffy's neck. Quickly, Faith rushes over and stakes Mr. Trick's heart from behind, bringing him to a dusty end.

At the library, Buffy talks to Giles about Faith's heroic act. They believe that there may still be hope for Faith. Little do they know that Faith plans on exploring her newly expanded horizons. Mayor Wilkins gets a visit from Faith at his office. With Mr. Trick out of the picture, Faith wants the available job. Intrigued, Mayor Wilkins lets her into the office, shutting the door behind her.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

'Buffy' always walks a fine line when down-to-earth matters impinge on the show's fantasy elements. There is a risk that the carefully nurtured suspension-of-belief bubble will burst completely if exposed to too much reality.

This episode, which, as the title suggests, deals with the fallout from the events of 'Bad Girls', is weighed down with numerous dialogue-laden scenes. There are dizzying changes of location, no doubt designed to introduce a sense of pace. The choppiness is unnecessarily distracting, and perhaps even a little insulting to 'Buffy' fans, who must realise by now that every so often there's a need to clear the air if things are not to stagnate.

Petrie's script deals with some serious issues, especially the underlying thread about Faith's brief fling with 'boy toy' Xander, and how it will affect his relationships with Buffy and Willow, but is terribly preachy in parts. Xander shows remarkable maturity here, but risks being sidelined in future episodes if he's no longer the group's buffoon.

Faith teaming up with the Mayor is a very welcome - if predictable - development. Unfortunately it only emphasises that his partnership with the late, unlamented Mr Trick wasn't working. The new relationship seems rather more potent, and laced with delightfully unwholesome undertones. Combining Faith and the Mayor means that, for the first time this season, Buffy and the gang have some serious opposition...

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Is it really so unusual that a Slayer has killed a human being? It hardly seemed to be a pressing issue in 'Ted', when Buffy thought she'd killed her mother's abusive boyfriend. If demons (like the Mayor) and vampires (like Spike and Angel) are potentially indistinguishable from humans, surely there 's a very strong possibility of mistaken identity accounting for a casualty or two...

There are a couple of continuity points mentioned. Wesley places a call to Quentin Travers, who appeared in @{"Helpless" LINK "HELPLESS"} and is asked for the codeword 'Monkey'. Willow mentions that she's still trying to change Amy back from her rat state (referring to the events at the end of 'Gingerbread').

@{b}Chris's Notes@{ub}

Faith saves Buffy's life towards the end of the episode, but she hardly rushes to the rescue (as the synopsis suggests). Buffy believes that this was a genuine heroic act, but the cynical side in me says it's possible she just didn't want another death on her conscience - also, she subsequently takes Mr. Trick's job.

"This world is no fun!" - Vampire Willow

Fed up with life as a mortal, Anyanka begs a demon named D'Hoffryn to create a temporal fold that would allow her to retrieve her powercenter - the necklace she wore around her neck - before it was destroyed. D'Hoffryn has no interest in helping Anyanka and would rather see her live out the rest of her life as a mortal. Anyanka pledges to find someone who will help her. Outside of Sunnydale High, Willow hones her pencil-floating skills while Buffy prepares for a traditional Slayer evaluation which Wesley is conducting. Later, Willow is called to Principal Snyder's office, where another student named Percy West is also waiting. Percy is one of the star members of Sunnydale High's basketball team who just so happens to be having trouble in history class. Principal Snyder orders Willow to tutor Percy. Afterwards, Willow and Buffy go to the library. While Willow heeds Giles' request to try to access the Mayor's computer files, Faith returns with Wesley from the physical portion of the tests.

Faith takes note of Willow's computer search, and she later reports it to Mayor Wilkins himself during a tour of Faith's new apartment. Decked out with nearly everything she could ever want (every Slayer has use for a PlayStation), the apartment leaves Faith absolutely giddy. Back at Sunnydale High, Willow learns that Oz and his band just returned from an out-of-town gig. Willow tells Oz that she may have wanted to go. Oz replies with the expectation that Willow wouldn't have wanted to miss a school day. Spotting Percy, Willow tries to arrange a meeting time for their tutor session. However, Percy has a different game plan which involves Willow doing all of the work for him. The last straw for Willow comes when Buffy comments on her reliability. Tired of being the goody-two-shoes of the group, Willow stalks off by herself. She runs into Anyanka, who introduces herself as Anya, a friend of Cordelia's.

Willow's mood takes a turn for the lighter when Anya asks for her help in performing a spell to create a temporal fold. Anya explains that she wants to retrieve a lost necklace which was a family heirloom. When Willow and Anya perform the spell, Willow sees visions of the alternate universe that Cordelia visited when she told Anya that she wished Buffy had never come to Sunnydale. Something goes wrong in the course of the spell. Instead of pulling the necklace out of the alternate universe, the vampire Willow is transported out just moments before Oz could dust her on the jagged wood. While Anya futilely searches for the necklace, Willow leaves her alone to try and figure out what she just saw.

Elsewhere, the Willow from the alternate reality awakens. After night falls, she ventures out onto the streets of Sunnydale. Quickly realizing the vast differences surrounding her, Alterna-Willow heads to the Bronze. There, she draws stares from everybody in attendance, including Percy West. Provoked by Percy's arrogance, Alterna-Willow shoves him over the pool table, then grabs him by the throat and tightens her grip. Xander pulls Percy away before noticing Willow's radical makeover. Thinking he's the Xander of her reality, Alterna-Willow pulls him into her arms, and gives him a bit of a shock by running her hands all over his body. It doesn't take long for her to realize that Xander is still a living, breathing human. Buffy arrives and can't believe her eyes when she sees Willow. When Alterna-Willow recognizes Buffy as the Slayer who staked her beloved Xander, she turns and heads for the Bronze's exit. Buffy tries to stop her, but Willow spins around with vamp face on. She then takes off, leaving Xander and Buffy horrified and speechless. Outside the Bronze, Alterna-Willow is attacked by two of Mayor Wilkins' vampire henchmen, one of whom is named Alfonse. They are confused to find that she's a vampire; they'd been sent after a human. With the help of a little sadistic brutality, Alterna-Willow convinces the vampires to work for her and restore chaos to Sunnydale.

Giles gets the word on Willow's untimely death from Buffy and Xander. During their lament over the loss of their friend, the Willow of their reality enters the library. Simultaneously confused and happy, Buffy, Xander, and Giles embrace Willow, who by this point is simply confused. While they tell Willow about her evil twin, Angel enters the Bronze in search of Buffy. As he talks to Oz, Alterna-Willow and her newly-hired cohorts invade the Bronze. After Angel leaves to get Buffy, Alterna-Willow kills and drinks from Sandy, one of the customers. Oz tries to make sense of what's going on, but Alterna-Willow only remembers him as a "white hat" -  one of the human rebels from her reality ("How come you're talking to me like we're friends?"). Anya clears up everything for the lost vampire, telling her that the Willow of this reality is the only one who can bring her back to where she belongs. Meanwhile, Angel reaches the library and walks right up to Buffy, Xander, and Giles. He doesn't notice Willow standing in the corner as he tells the gang that their friend is dead. Willow makes her presence known, sending Angel into the pits of confusion as well. Realizing they have to stop whatever's about to go down at the Bronze, the group leaves the library. Willow, however, is reluctant to kill her alter ago.

Remembering the tranquilizer gun, Willow tells the others to go ahead while she heads back into the library. Before she can get the gun, Willow encounters her mirror image, who has sneaked into the library unnoticed. Intrigued by the idea of occupying a world with her double, Alterna-Willow gets uncomfortably cozy with Willow, who retaliates with a cross. Alterna-Willow then knocks her over the counter. When the vampire circles around the counter, she is greeted by a tranquilizer dart right in the stomach. Buffy and the gang return and lock Alterna-Willow inside the bookcage. Buffy then comes up with a plan to take care of the vampires in the Bronze.

Disguised in the outfit of her other self, Willow prepares to infiltrate the Bronze and trick the vampires into walking outside, one by one, and getting staked by her friends waiting outside. As Willow enters the Bronze, Alterna-Willow wakes up in her prison. While she notices her own change of clothes, Cordelia enters the library. Alterna-Willow tries to talk her into opening the cage, but Cordy opts to use this opportunity to talk about the secret affair with Xander. After an eternity of rambling, Cordy finally opens the cage. Hungry for blood, Alterna-Willow chases Cordy through the halls before cornering her in a restroom.

Before the vampire can close in for the kill, Wesley appears and fends her off with a cross and holy water. Thwarted, Alterna-Willow turns around and leaves. Meanwhile, Anya and Alfonse eventually see through Willow's charade. Willow screams, signaling the others to storm into the Bronze and battle the remaining vampires inside. During the fight, Alterna- Willow arrives and pins Willow on the stage. After dusting Alfonse, Buffy leaps onto the stage and drives a pool cue towards the vampire's heart. Willow screams for Buffy to stop, and the Slayer is able to halt her weapon's descent.

After all of the customers evacuate the Bronze, Alterna-Willow and Anya prepare for another temporal fold. Buffy does not agree with the idea of returning a demon to its own reality where it can kill again. Willow responds by saying that she simply can't kill her. Before Willow sits down to perform the ritual, she says her goodbyes to Alterna-Willow, who says hers in a much more touchy-feely way. Afterwards, Alterna-Willow is returned to the alternate reality... only to be grabbed by Oz and dusted on the jagged wood. The next day, Willow contemplates living up to her good girl reputation and never going out for fun again. When Percy appears with the history paper completely typed out, Willow decides otherwise.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

As Faith settles into her new abode, and into a cosy new power pact with Mayor Wilkins, the protagonist role shifts to Anyanka (a.k.a. Anya), the demon from 'The Wish', a very promising character with an interesting history.

This episode is the flip side of 'The Wish': in that episode the characters from our version of Sunnydale were flung into an alternative universe. Here it's the other way around: a character from the parallel dimension is dragged into our reality, an event that gives Alyson Hannigan the perfect opportunity to have a lot of fun. Joss Whedon's taut script contains elements that would be more familiar in a West End farce, but the episode sizzles with energy, and bubbles with memorable, snappy dialogue.

This is a tour de force for Hannigan, who skilfully manages to play four different roles ('our' Willow, the Vampire Willow, 'our' Willow pretending to be the Vamp Willow, and the Vamp Willow pretending to be 'our' Willow) and she provides the funniest scenes of the season in the process!

On the debit side, there's a strange sense that time is being manipulated to accommodate all the twists and turns that Whedon has created, particularly during the scenes when Willow is trying to hold court as the Vamp Willow, and it's hard not to fault Whedon's decision to stake the Vampire Willow at the end of the episode. Joss may think that the character had run its course, but it's likely that the audience would strongly disagree with him... (She was hot! - Saddo Ed)

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

This episode is a sequel to 'The Wish', so it's not surprising that there are several references back to that episode, including Vampire Willow recognising Oz - even with his black hair! - as a "white hat", a reference to Larry, Nancy, Oz and Giles' white knight activities.

Principal Snyder's "We need a winning year, especially after last year's debacle with the swim team" is a reference to the events in 'Go Fish'.

Xander and Willow refer to 'Old Yeller', a 1957 Disney movie about farm life in Texas in 1869. The film, about an adopted stray dog, has a notoriously sad ending, which was also referenced in the 'Friends' episode 'The One Where Old Yeller Dies'. (Oops, did we give away the plot?)

@{b}Chris's Notes@{ub}

Angel has revealed over the past two or three episodes a bit more about the connection between the personalities of a human and the vampire they are turned into. We already know that they must share memories - Angel lives with the guilt of all Angelus' sins every day of his life. When Buffy tells Willow to remember that vampire Willow has nothing to do with the real Willow, Angel suggests that this isn't the case, but for Willow's sake he stops himself from going into the details.

"You still my girl?" - Angel
"Always." - Buffy

After a rather uncomfortable time at the movie theater, Angel and Buffy remind themselves that they can still love each other completely without going all the way. Their kiss is interrupted by the arrival of Faith, who has been cleared by the Council to resume her Slayer duties. Buffy leaves Angel to join Faith on a nightly patrol around town. In one of the cemeteries, they encounter a demon who offers to sell them the Books of Ascension for the price of $5,000. He mentions the Mayor's interest in the books, which motivates Buffy to stop Faith from killing the demon. Buffy wants to know more about these books and why the Mayor would want them. After Buffy heads home, Faith reports to the Mayor about the demon and his offer. Mayor Wilkins orders Faith to hunt down the demon, kill him, and retrieve the Books of Ascension.

In the library the next morning, Buffy tells Wesley and the others about the previous night's patrol. Following a tip from Willow, Giles locates a passage in one of his texts that refers to the Ascension. On the supposed day of a previous Ascension, an entire town was apparently wiped out. Cordelia enters the library and indirectly asks Wesley out for dinner later that week. Meanwhile, Faith tracks the demon all the way to the apartment where he's been staying. She attempts to kill the demon with one stab of her knife, but the demon doesn't give up so easily. After a rough struggle, the demon finally dies, leaving his blood on Faith's hands. Faith stares at her hands for a moment, visibly shaken. She then collects the books and leaves. Later that night, Faith visits Angel at the mansion. She shows him her hands which are still stained with the demon's blood. Angel listens as Faith expresses her dismay over possibly losing control. Angel embraces her for comfort, leading Faith to try to initiate a kiss. Angel backs off, reminding Faith that his heart belongs to Buffy. As Faith leaves, she gives Angel a small kiss on the cheek. This kiss is witnessed by Buffy, whose arrival at the mansion goes unnoticed. At City Hall, Faith tells Mayor Wilkins that she failed in her plan to give Angel the moment of true happiness required to lift his soul. The Mayor decides to take another course of action.

The next day, Wesley instructs Buffy to take Faith and find the demon. Xander arrives with the demon's address, which he obtained by bribing Willy the bartender. Buffy is reluctant to bring Faith along, who soon shows up and is filled in on their orders. Buffy and Faith enter the demon's apartment and find his dead body on the floor. During their assessment of the scene, Buffy senses something wrong about Faith's behavior. Meanwhile, Mayor Wilkins summons a shrouded man to his office for a special job, one that involves the removal of one's soul. Back at Sunnydale High, Buffy tells Willow what she saw at the mansion between Angel and Faith. Willow assures Buffy that she has nothing to worry about, for Angel would never fall for Faith's moves. Little do they know that Faith is at the mansion at this very moment, putting the moves on Angel once again.

When he places his hands on Faith's shoulders to let her know that everything will be okay, she douses a dark liquid onto the center of Angel's chest. The shrouded man suddenly appears out of nowhere and casts a spell that surrounds Angel in a field of energy. Once Angel falls to the floor, the shrouded man disappears. When Angel gets back up, he's in full vamp-face, hungry for Faith's kiss. After they part lips, Angel knocks Faith to the floor. He thanks her for turning him back into the evil Angelus. Faith whips out her stake and forces Angel to listen to her. When he finally agrees, Faith leads him to the Mayor's office... but not until after they kiss again on the floor.

At the library, Willow notifies Wesley, Giles, and the others that her computer searches for the Mayor's files have turned up as dead ends - they have been deleted. Oz suggests researching the Mayor at the Hall of Records. While Wesley, Willow, Oz, and Cordelia head to the Hall of Records, Xander decides to patrol the streets for any further information. Buffy, in the meantime, heads back home to prepare for an investigation of Mayor Wilkins' office. At the office, the Mayor has a hard time getting Angel's undivided attention. Angel tries to kill Mayor Wilkins with a letter opener. However, the Mayor reveals his invulnerability to the vampire. Mayor Wilkins then orders Angel and Faith to take care of the other Slayer in town. On their way to Buffy's house, Angel and Faith see Xander walking down the street towards them. Xander tries to find out where they've been, but the only response he gets is a right hook from Angel's fist. As Xander falls to the pavement, unconscious, Angel and Faith continue walking without missing a step. Joyce lets both of them into the house. Upstairs, Angel and Faith tell Buffy that they have the Books of Ascension at the mansion, and they want Buffy to be with them when they deliver the books to Giles.

At the Hall of Records, the gang locates an old photograph of Mayor Wilkins that was taken a century ago. As Wesley realizes that Mayor Wilkins must be over a hundred years old, Xander arrives to tell them about the return of Angel's bad self. Wesley suggests that they inform Giles, but Xander's news of Faith's involvement leads them to look for Buffy immediately ("Imagine the possibilities"). Buffy follows Angel and Faith to the mansion. Once there, Angel reveals his recent change in personality to Buffy. Attempting to escape, Buffy finds her exit blocked by Faith. Angel knocks Buffy out cold, then ties her up in chains. When Buffy comes to, Faith explains her reasons for taking the path she's taken. Faith couldn't tolerate being in Buffy's shadow ever since she arrived in Sunnydale. The popular belief that Buffy is superior to Faith has driven the new Slayer to where she is today. Buffy taunts Faith by claiming that she can stop the Mayor's Ascension. Faith laughs this off, telling them that the Ascension cannot be stopped and will take place, as planned, on Graduation Day. With this information out in the open, Angel drops the evil Angelus act, while Buffy drops the chains that were supposedly restraining her. When Faith realizes that it was all a set-up, she shoves Angel to the side and attacks Buffy. Wesley, Xander, and the rest of the gang arrive just in time to see Angel falling towards them. As Angel and Xander go down, Buffy and Faith battle to a stand-still, with a knife held up to each other's throat. Faith calls Buffy's bluff, then runs out of the mansion.

Mayor Wilkins comforts Faith at her new apartment by reminding her that once the Ascension takes place, her broken friendship with Buffy and the others will be irrelevant. At the library, Giles thanks the shrouded man for participating in the scheme to expose Faith and the Mayor's plans. The shrouded man announces that his debt to Giles has been paid. After the shrouded man disappears into thin air, Giles informs everyone that he introduced the shrouded man to his wife - thus, the debt. While Wesley and the others discuss the newly-learned information concerning the Ascension and its date, Buffy reminds Xander that Angel was only acting when he punched him. However, Buffy doesn't seem so sure of her own words. Later, Buffy visits Angel at the mansion. He assures Buffy that he never meant to take the act so far as to hurt her. Disturbed by the harsh reminder of what Angel could become again, Buffy insists that they put their relationship on hold for a while.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

'Enemies' works hard to keep viewers off-kilter, and skilfully manages to use their preconceptions and expectations against them. In this respect the key scene is the mysterious shaman's "lightshow", used by Angel to trick Faith into thinking that he had turned again, and by the writer (Douglas Petrie) and the director (David Grossman, making his Buffy debut) to mislead the audience.

The shaman must have been one of the cheapest demons the show has created, (only the hands and eyes needed to be made up), and yet he's also one of the most effective. It's a pity that his debt to Giles has been "repaid in full", since it would have been nice to see him turn up again.

'Enemies' is very much a "from point A to point B" episode, continuing to explore Faith's pact with the Mayor - just how naive is she? - and finally revealing her as a traitor to her former friends. Petrie uses the lull to successfully flesh out the character of the Mayor, an evil creature who encourages Faith to drink milk for the sake of her bones and teeth, and threatens to subject her to that most hideous of tortures: miniature golf! A dozen episodes have passed since the Mayor was introduced to the series (in @{"Homecoming" LINK "HOMECOMING"}), and until now he's been a rather impotent villain.

Finally, 'Enemies' sees the ongoing Buffy / Angel romance beginning to cool off, a sure sign that the end of the season is rapidly approaching.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Faith's line "All your little lame-ass friends are going to be kibbles 'n' bits" refers to an American brand of dog food.

In a rare cultural reference that dates back further than the '60s, Buffy's line "The girl [Faith] makes Godot look punctual" is a nod to a famous play by Irish author Samuel Beckett, 'En attendant Godot' ('Waiting For Godot'), published in 1952. Beckett's surreal experimental play features two people, Vladimir and Estragon, who conclude that because they exist where they are, they must be waiting for someone; someone they name Godot. Their endless patience is in vain, however, as the continually elusive Godot never appears.

Oz, who has barely anything to do in this episode, has obviously had time to dye his hair blond since 'Dopplegangland', possibly emulating the Scott Evil character in "Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me"...

Miniature Golf, (the activity the Mayor suggests to cheer Faith up), also featured in the second season episode 'Ted'.

@{b}Chris's Notes@{ub}

The way that the gang's plan is revealed towards the end is a shock, and even watching the episode with the benefit of hindsight, there are no real clues given to the viewer. It's nearly as bad as the 'wake up and it's all been a bad dream' scenario.

Another thing - even if Angel had had sex with Faith, would that really have given him a moment true happiness? Surely the guilt of betraying Buffy would weigh too heavily on his mind?

"Sure, we can work it after school, you know, if you're not too busy having sex with my mother!" - Buffy

On a routine night of patrolling, Buffy encounters a pair of mouthless demons. While she kills one of them on a table at the park, the other demon manages to flee the scene. As she leaves, Buffy fails to notice the dead demon's blood on her hand, which quickly absorbs into her skin. The next morning, after learning from Willow that everybody will be attending the basketball game later that night, Buffy decides to check out the itch on her hand that's been bugging her all day. In the library, Giles finds an article on the demon that Buffy killed. In it, he learns that physical contact with the demons can cause an infection, in the form of an assimilation of one of the demon's traits. Later that night during the game, Buffy patrols the streets of Sunnydale by herself. She bumps into Angel, from whom she has been distant ever since the trick they played on Faith.

While talking to her friends the next day in the lounge, Buffy inadvertently hears Xander's own thoughts. On the way to the library, she realizes that she can hear what each student is thinking. At the library, Giles concludes that the demons must have communicated telepathically if they had no mouths. Buffy uses her newfound trait to impress her teacher in English class, much to the envy of a classmate sitting next to her. During the class, Buffy hears some grim thoughts coming from Freddy Iverson, one of the writers for the school newspaper. After class, Buffy visits Angel at the mansion and tries to learn what's going on inside his head. However, Angel informs Buffy that her power can't work on a vampire's mind. He then tries to assure Buffy that he was never tempted by Faith during the entire ordeal that revealed her affiliation with the Mayor.

Buffy returns to the library, where her friends have just learned of the Slayer's new ability. Disturbed and intimidated by this sudden intrusion into their privacy, Xander, Willow, and the others find it tough to be around Buffy. Willow is afraid that she'll become redundant, and that Buffy might soon know Oz better than her, while Xander worries about his mind's pre-occupation with sex. In the hallways, Buffy starts to realize the true downside to her mind-reading ability, for the abundance of thoughts coming from all directions proves to be overwhelming. In the cafeteria, a mental declaration to murder all of the students the next day is heard by Buffy. She tries to identify the source of the thought, but the overflow of thoughts causes her to pass out.

Outside, Buffy regains consciousness and tells the others about the murder plan she discovered. While Buffy goes home to rest, the gang tries to locate the suspect. They try to interrogate all of the prime suspects, but Oz has trouble tracking down Freddy. Meanwhile, Giles and Wesley learn that Buffy needs to consume the heart of the second demon in order to be cured of her mind-reading power. With the Slayer out of action, Giles turns to Angel for help. After hunting down the demon over the course of the night, Angel finally succeeds in obtaining its heart. He brings it to the Summers' home and feeds it to Buffy. Eventually, Buffy wakes up and discovers that she can no longer read anybody's mind.

Back at the school, Xander, Willow, Cordelia, and Oz corner Freddy in the newspaper office. Upon learning that he has nothing to do with the murder plot, Cordelia finds an announcement on the desk from Jonathan that apparently admits to the planned killing ("Death is the only way."). Buffy arrives at the newspaper office just in time to help the gang search for Jonathan. While Xander gets distracted by some tasty treats in the cafeteria, Buffy runs out into the courtyard, where she spots Jonathan assembling a rifle at the top of the clock tower.

Running out of time, Buffy takes the shortest route possible to the roof. Just as Jonathan attaches the final piece, Buffy crashes into the room. Aiming at rifle at Buffy, Jonathan tries to prevent her from getting in the way of his plan. He tells her how fed up he is with how everybody treats and thinks of him. Buffy responds by telling Jonathan that everybody has their own pain, regardless of how good their lives may seem on the outside. When Jonathan finally hands over the rifle, he shocks Buffy by telling her that he intended to kill himself, not the other students.

Inside the cafeteria, Xander witnesses the lunch lady pouring rat poison into a large pot in the kitchen. He runs out and warns everybody about the lethal lunch special. Xander trips and falls to the floor, giving the lunch lady enough time to tower over him with a large butcher knife in her hand. Luckily, Buffy arrives on the scene and puts the lunch lady down for the count.

Willow learns from Buffy that things are going better with Angel, now that some uncertainties about his feelings for Buffy are no longer an issue. After meeting up with Giles, Buffy shocks him by revealing her awareness of his escapades with Joyce while under the influence of the mind-altering candy in @{"Band Candy" LINK "BANDCANDY"}. Giles promptly walks into a tree.

Episode synopsis by Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

'Earshot' is an episode that contains a brilliant premise - Buffy the mind reader! - but the restriction of the 'hour-long' (45 commercial-free minutes in BBC land! - Ed) format dictates that the plot must be advanced, and ultimately resolved, before its full potential has been mined. Still, before Buffy is confined to bed with a bad case of sensory overload there's much to enjoy.

It's a great opportunity for Jane Espenson to highlight some very interesting character traits: Xander worries that Buffy will discover that he has a one-track mind ("Naked girls! Naked woman! Naked Buffy!"), Willow fears that Buffy will soon know more about the inscrutable Oz than she does, and Wesley has his illicit relationship with Cordelia to conceal ("I am a bad, bad man"). Buffy also catches Oz deep in philosophical thought.

Espenson captures Cordelia's shallowness beautifully: she has nothing to fear from Buffy's new ability because she is completely superficial, and simply blurts out whatever crosses her mind.

The fun fizzles out when the episode switches to Scooby gang mode, and the investigation into the "This time tomorrow I'll kill you all" threat takes over. The episode becomes quite mechanical at this point, and quickly loses momentum. The hunt for clues is reminiscent of previous investigations, like those in 'The Puppet Show' and 'Go Fish'. This is a feeling reinforced by the appearance of a couple of suspects that have featured in similar situations before, including a conveniently suicidal Jonathan (Danny Strong), and the now happily out of the closet Larry (Larry Bagby III).

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

The original transmission of this episode was famously delayed because of a tragic real-life shooting incident at the Littleton High School in Colorado. Subsequently this episode has been placed where it was originally to air, between 'Enemies' and 'Choices'.

People with psychic abilities are a science fiction staple, and the subject has frequently been explored in movies, TV series and novels. Most, like 'Carrie', are revenge dramas that deal with telekinesis, (the ability to remotely manipulate objects), or, like 'The Dead Zone', focus on characters who can predict the future. Very few movies have concentrated on the subject of telepathy.

A couple of movies have used telepathic powers to transmit thoughts into others, as in 'Dreamscape' (1983), 'The Sender' (1982) and Michael Reeves' chilling 'The Sorcerers' (1967), but only one about telepathy springs to mind, a 1963 Disney film called 'The Misadventures of Merlin Jones', about a college student who invents a helmet that enables him to read minds.

'Earshot' most closely resembles a 1961 episode of the fantasy story anthology series 'The Twilight Zone' called 'Penny For Your Thoughts', which starred Dick York, (three years before starring in 'Bewitched'), as a meek bank clerk who suddenly discovers that he can read minds, and uses his new skills for career advancement. For a more light-hearted depiction of telepathy in the movies, check out the opening scene of 'Ghostbusters'!

Buffy finally learns that her mother and Giles had sex - twice! - under the influence of Ethan Rayne's drugged chocolate, in 'Band Candy'. Previously this had only been implied.

@{b}Chris's Notes@{ub}

The vast media coverage of the Columbine high school shooting makes Oz's comments about such practices "bordering on trendy" all the more eerie and ironic. Especially since the killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, said they hoped someone would make a film about the massacre.

This episode has a very 'season two' feel to it. This is possibly due to the absence of Faith and the Mayor from the script - and the presence of Jonathan, who appeared often in the second season.

"It's a good fight, Buffy, and I want in." - Willow

Mayor Wilkins needs a favor, and to get Faith to do it for him, he gives her a gift - a beautiful new dagger. He tells her that a package is arriving tomorrow night from South America that is crucial to his ascension, and he wants Faith to pick it up for him. Faith dutifully heads to the airport, where a propeller plane lands in the misty night. A courier steps forth, but before he can deliver the package, Faith shoots him through the back with an arrow. She then gets into a limousine with the vamp-lackey who brought her there and drives off.

Buffy and Angel, meanwhile, are busy slaying a couple of vampires. After they've finished them off, Buffy laments to Angel that she feels she's in a rut. She's beginning to realize that her future with Angel is going to have some limitations. Another limitation she's thinking about is her college choice. Though she's gotten into Northwestern, which makes her mother very excited, she knows she still has obligations in Sunnydale, and doesn't know if she'll be able to go away to college. Willow is also contemplating her college choices, as she has recently received acceptance letters from Oxford, Yale, MIT and Harvard, among others. Xander is thinking about hitting the road, a la Jack Kerouac. Cordelia, as usual, has some snide comments for them all.

Buffy finally decides she wants to leave Sunnydale, and goes to Wesley to tell him. Wesley tells her she can't leave Sunnydale, especially with Faith gone bad and the Mayor's ascension coming up. Buffy asks him if she could go if she can stop the ascension, which would mean Wesley and Giles would only have to take care of the run-of-the-mill stuff, and she could take care of the major stuff when she came home on breaks. Wesley and Giles consider the possibility, but tell Buffy that to consider it seriously, Buffy would have to stop the Mayor's ascension. She suggests taking the fight to them - taking the offensive rather than just waiting for it to happen to them. They all agree that it's a good idea, and Buffy heads off to find out what Faith and the Mayor are up to. She heads to City Hall, where she spies Faith bringing a big box inside. The Mayor is quite excited to see the box. He has the box taken to a room upstairs and secured. Outside, Buffy stops the limo that has just dropped Faith off, smashes through the driver's-side window and yanks the driver through it. She asks him about the box. When she returns to the Library, Buffy tells everyone that the box is the Box of Gavroc. It houses demonic energy, and the Mayor needs to devour its contents before Ascension Day. Xander, Willow, Buffy, Giles and Wesley devise a plan to get the box, and start to work.

To get to the box, they will need a potion to break the shield that protects it. Willow researches a formula, and Xander and Oz concoct the potion. With the potion in hand, Buffy, Willow and Angel climb to the top of City Hall, just above the room where the box lies. Opening the skylight, they peer down at the box below. Willow recites a spell, then sprinkles the potion down onto the box. The protective shield dissolves. Angel then straps Buffy in a harness and lowers her through the skylight and down to the box. When she grabs the box, an alarm goes off - and as Angel tries to pull Buffy back up, the harness gets stuck. Two of the Mayor's vamp-lackeys respond to the alarm and rush into the room. Since the harness is still stuck, Angel drops down into the room to join Buffy in fighting the two vamp-lackeys. After an extended fight, Angel and Buffy knock down the vamps and run out of the room. Racing out of City Hall, they jump behind a bush to hide. When a van pulls up in front of City Hall and then speeds away, the vamps chase after it, thinking Buffy and Angel are inside. The vamps return to City Hall empty-handed, and Mayor Wilkins is not happy to find that the box is stolen. But while he's lost the box, he's gained something - Faith has captured Willow.

Back at the library, the gang tries to figure out what to do about the box - and Willow. Xander proposes an assault to get her back. Buffy suggests they can trade the box back to the Mayor in exchange for Willow. Wesley doesn't think that's a good idea; he argues that thousands of lives are at stake, and that Willow's one life is not worth more. He argues that they must destroy the box and stop the ascension, and find another way to get Willow back. Buffy, who is quite upset, says there is no other way. Oz helps make the group's decision when he slams a pot against the wall. He doesn't say anything. He doesn't have to. They will make the trade.

Back at City Hall, Willow is trapped, and looking for a way out. One of the Mayor's vamp-henchmen comes in, and menacingly readies to take a bite of her. Willow floats a pencil behind him, and before he can bite, she uses the pencil to slay the vampire. She then escapes from her shackles, and begins to roam City Hall. Wandering into the Mayor's office, she finds the Books of the Ascension in his closet and begins to read. She's so engrossed in the books she doesn't even notice Faith walking into the room. Faith is ready to kill her. Willow buys herself some time by talking to Faith about the choices she's made to give up being a slayer, and that those choices have left her alone, but she can still come back to their side if she wants. Mayor Wilkins then walks in the room, interrupting the conversation. He's received an interesting phone call...

A meeting has been arranged for the school cafeteria. The Mayor brings Willow, and Wesley, Giles, Angel, Oz, Xander and Buffy bring the box to make an exchange. Before the exchange is completed, Principal Snyder breaks in on the meeting, with two policemen in tow. One of the policemen, examining the box, opens it - and a giant spider jumps out and gnaws on his face. After snacking on the policeman, it scampers away - and lands on the Mayor's face. Faith wrestles it off him, and since he's impervious to harm, he quickly heals. Principal Snyder doesn't quite know what to make of all of it. Buffy runs over and shuts the box, but not before another of the spiders can escape. One of them lands on her back, and she falls backwards to crush it. Spying another one along the wall, Faith kills it with her dagger. After the exchange, back at the library, Giles asks Willow what she can remember from the books. Willow says she can't remember much - it was a little wordy for her - then with a grin pulls out a few pages she managed to tear from the book. Though they now know more about the Ascension, the Mayor has the Box of Gavroc again, which means they are basically back where they started.

Buffy is still thinking about dealing with the Mayor, but her future is weighing heavy in her mind as well. She tells Willow that she feels she'll never get out of Sunnydale. Willow, though, says that might not be so bad - she's decided to stay at home and go to UC- Sunnydale, and so they'll be able to stay together as friends. Willow explains that she realized she wants to fight evil, and help people, and she feels she can do that best in Sunnydale, which is why she wants to stay. It's a good fight they're fighting, and she wants to keep fighting it.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

There have been admirably few Buffy... episodes where one of the gang is held to ransom by the bad guys; a dramatic device that's served countless movies and TV episodes faithfully since images were first recorded on film. It's a tired idea, inevitably leading to foiled escape attempts and the heroes arriving in the nick of time to rescue their comrade. Sadly David Fury's script adds little to the formula, merely the unbelievable notion that Willow would hang around in the Mayor's office reading the Books of Ascension rather than flee.

There is some nice character interaction in this episode that makes up for the dire plotting: Willow standing up to Faith; Faith's unsettling relationship with the Mayor; the gang teaming up against Wesley; and more signs that the romance between Buffy and Angel is flagging. It's tempting to echo Wes's observation that by the end of the episode, 'we're right back where we started', but it's not true. This episode is the first to really make full use of the Mayor, and finally brings the season's chief villain face to face with the Slayer, (after a series of frustrating near-misses).

'Choices' is a good episode for Willow, giving Alyson Hannigan a few choice scenes that she illuminates beautifully. There's also plenty of time allocated to laying the groundwork for the next season, which will see a couple of characters departing, and a whole new setting for those that remain...

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Pop culture: Xander is reading Jean-Luis ('Jack') Kerouac's 1957 novel "On The Road", a stream of consciousness novel about a group of freewheeling young people travelling nomadically back and forth across the US. It's widely acknowledged as being the first literary product of the 1950's "Beat movement", typified by a reactionary attitude towards authority, and an introspective, somewhat hedonistic lifestyle.

Pop culture 2: Faith chides Willow for "Nancy Drew-ing", a reference to the heroine of a series of children's books about a nosy young reporter. The books, by 'Carolyn Keene', were first published in 1930. Later that decade Warner Brothers turned them into a series of movies, starring Bonita Granville. In 1977 Universal created a TV series, mixing Drew stories with episodes featuring the male characters from a series of similar books by 'Franklin W. Dixon': 'The Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries'. Both series of books were actually the product of a writing syndicate founded in 1906 by Edward Stratemeyer.

Pop culture 3: There are references to a couple of very popular movies. Buffy says that Faith has turned to 'the dark side', a nod to George Lucas' 'Star Wars' series. Later in the episode, Faith tells the Mayor 'I made him an offer he couldn't survive', paraphrasing a famous line from Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 Mafia movie 'The Godfather'. (The original line is 'My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse').

We get to discover a little more about the Mayor in this episode. He once had an Irish setter named Rusty, and he married a woman named Edna May in 1903. Because he never aged, her eventually outlived her.

Buffy has an aunt in Illinois, named Arlene. This is presumably Joyce's sister, since Joyce phones her to share the news about Buffy's acceptance to Northwesten University.

"I bet you would look way 007 in a tux!" - Cordelia

Buffy wakes up to find herself beside Angel, on his bed in the mansion. Exhausted after a night of patrolling, she apparently crashed at Angel's instead of returning home. Before getting up, Buffy reminds Angel that the Senior Prom is quickly approaching. Back at Sunnydale High, Xander is approached by Anya, who has not yet regained her powers. Confused by the wealth of human emotions inside her, Anya asks Xander to be her date to the Prom. Aware of his situation and general lack of alternatives, Xander accepts. While he tells the rest of the gang about this recent development, Joyce pays a visit to the mansion. Angel listens as Joyce tells him about the reality of his relationship with her daughter. Deep down, Angel knows that what Joyce wants is also what needs to be done. Back at the library, Giles futilely tries to keep everyone's mind focused on the Mayor's Ascension plans. However, all Buffy and her friends can think about right now is the upcoming Prom. Elsewhere, a boy inserts a videotape into a VCR for the viewing pleasure of his "pet", a demon beast locked in a cage that goes berserk as the tape begins to play.

Later that night, Angel has a nightmare that begins pleasantly with a wedding between himself and Buffy. After they are wed, they head down the aisle and step out into the sunlight. Angel then watches in horror as Buffy ignites into flames. He can do nothing as the fire consumes her completely. After Angel wakes up, he joins Buffy on a nightly patrol. While tracking down a vampire in the sewers, Angel admits to Buffy that he can't maintain their relationship, knowing what it will mean for her future. Buffy refuses to believe what he is saying, but Angel makes it clear that he doesn't want her to spend the rest of her life with him. As it slowly sinks in, Angel announces his decision to leave Sunnydale after the threat of the Mayor's Ascension has been eliminated. Later, Buffy tells Willow everything that happened. Although they both understand and agree with Angel's intentions, Buffy lets her tears flow instead of hiding her grief. Noticing Cordelia checking out a dress once again in one of the shops, Xander enters the store and pries into the matter. He soon learns that Cordy works there. Cordy's family is now broke as a result of her father committing tax fraud for twelve years. Cordy's verbal outburst is interrupted by the sudden intrusion of the demon beast into the store.

Xander tries to fight it, but the beast tosses Xander aside and mauls a well-dressed boy to death. As soon as its job is done, the beast looks at the remaining customers before quickly exiting the store. At the library, Xander and the others review the store's security video of the event. Cordy makes an observation that the demon beast was seemingly interested in the tuxedoed boy only. During the beast's exit, Oz spots a boy standing outside of the store with what looks like a remote control of some sort. Using the Sunnydale High yearbook, the gang identifies the boy as Tucker Wells. Upon figuring out that Tucker's plan is to set the demon beast - which Wesley identifies as a hell hound - loose on the students at the Senior Prom, Buffy vows to take care of this matter personally and ensure a safe and happy Prom for all.

While everyone splits up to investigate, Buffy goes to a butcher shop since the hell hound eats brains. She gets Tucker's address from one of the employees. Buffy then notices that Angel is also there, buying a supply of blood for himself. Angel tries to talk to her, but Buffy opts to focus her attention on Tucker and his hell hound. She returns to the library and tells the others that it's all in her hands now. After the gang leaves to get ready for the Prom, a concerned Giles wonders what's gotten into Buffy. She tells him about Angel's plans to leave her and Sunnydale. As she clocks out for the night, Cordy finds out that Xander helped pay off the dress she was hoping to wear to the dance. At the Prom, Xander painfully listens to Anya's countless stories of male persecution, while Wesley assists Giles in his chaperone duties.

Cordy enters in her dress, which draws Wesley to her in an instant. Arm in arm, they meet up with Xander and Anya. Cordy subtly thanks Xander for his generosity. Meanwhile, Buffy breaks into Tucker's house and encounters him in the basement. After subduing him, Buffy notices the stacks of teen flicks - some horror, some not - on top of a nearby VCR. Tucker then surprises Buffy by revealing three empty cages in an adjoining room. Buffy races back to the school to stop the three hell hounds from completing their mission. One by one, she kills them off, taking out the last one in front of a bewildered student.

With the hell hounds taken care of, Buffy finally arrives at the dance to join her friends. Later that evening, during the presentation of the class awards, Jonathan steps onto the stage and addresses Buffy in response to an overwhelming number of write-in votes for a new category. Buffy listens in pleasant surprise as Jonathan states the senior class' appreciation for her life-saving deeds over the course of the past three years. Named the Class Protector, Buffy steps up to the stage to receive her reward while the entire class applauds. After the awards ceremony, Angel arrives in a tux for one last dance with Buffy. In each other's arms, they enjoy what little time they have left before the Mayor's Ascension arrives at last.

Episode synopsis by Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

Taking pause to regroup before the season finale, 'The Prom' has some housekeeping to take care of, not least of which is the considerable task of preparing for Angel's departure, the most difficult event that the series' producers have had to tackle so far. This event prompts a couple of memorable scenes: Buffy and Angel's well written and beautifully performed "I can't believe you're breaking up with me" moment; and Angel's wedding dream - which must have given the people who put together trailers palpitations!

Joyce's visit to Angel at the Mansion is an odd and bizarre scene that makes little sense. Nevertheless, it's quite funny - you can easily guess what went through Joyce's mind when she saw Angel's manacles!

The main monster-of-the-week plot seems woefully half-hearted, (a feeling reinforced by Buffy's casual dismissal of Tucker's explanation for his actions - "whatever"), something that no amount of hype from Chris Beck's powerhouse score can disguise.

It's likely that the episode would have benefited from more focus on this, and rather less on the scene where Buffy is given the award for keeping the school's mortality rate so low, which rapidly alternates between being rather touching, to pathetically sentimental.

The rest of the prom scenes are generally successfully handled, and the event seems remarkably well populated (there are signs of thrift elsewhere in the episode, like the Spartan slaughterhouse set). Marti Noxon' s script excels in small intimate exchanges: Giles and Wesley share a couple of witty exchanges, and Anya and Xander's relationship shows considerable promise. The episode culminates in Angel's arrival, for one final show-stealing moment...

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

The tapes in Tucker's video collection, (which he uses to taunt and train the devil dogs), are:

'Prom Night' (1980) - a slasher movie starring "Halloween"'s Jamie Leigh Curtis about a hooded killer who's avenging the death of a bullied young girl.

'Prom Night IV - Deliver Us From Evil' (1992) - pseudo-sequel to "Prom Night", about a homicidal priest who goes on the rampage after waking from a thirty-year coma! (Presumably 'Prom Night II - Hello Mary Lou' and 'Prom Night III - The Last Kiss' were out when Tucker visited Big Lou's video store!)

'Pump Up The Volume' (1990) - campus drama about a high school student (played by Christian Slater) who hosts an incendiary pirate radio show. The film featured Seth Green (Oz) and Juliet Landau (Drusilla).

'Pretty In Pink' (1986) - John Hughes movie about the adolescent struggles of a misfit teenage girl (Molly Ringwald).

'Carrie' (1976) - influential movie about a young woman (Sissy Spacek) whose powerful telekinetic powers are unleashed at the school prom. The film is also a name-checked in Buffy's line "Gotta stop a crazy from pulling a Carrie at the prom". The film is based on Stephen king's first novel, published in 1974.

Several songs are referred to, either directly (Sister Sledge's 1979 hit 'We Are Family'), or indirectly (Prince's '1999' (1982), in Buffy's line "Now I'm gonna lock you in here, and then I'm gonna party like it's ...[1999]"). The song that lures the devil dogs back towards the prom is Kool and the Gang's biggest hit, 1980's 'Celebration'. The song that Angel and Buffy dance to at the end of the episode is The Sundays' 'Wild Horses' (a late addition to their 1992 album 'Blind', 'Wild Horses' is a cover version of a track on the 1971 Rolling Stones album 'Sticky Fingers').

Buffy's assertion that Angel is 243 years old again contradicts the continuity mentioned in 'Becoming - Part One', (which states that Angel became a vampire in 1753, three years out). In @{"Earshot" LINK "EARSHOT"}, @{"Some Assembly Required" LINK "SOMEASSEMBLY"} and @{"Reptile Boy" LINK "REPTILEBOY"}, Angel's date of birth is given as 1755 or 1756.

Cordelia's presence at the April Fools dress shop (in @{"Choices" LINK "CHOICES"}) is clarified, setting up Xander's touching act of kindness later in the episode.

Joyce's line to Angel "You don't drink? Beverages, I mean?" may be a nod to a famous quote from Universal's 1931 film version of 'Dracula', starring Bela Lugosi. In a scene where the Count is entertaining his lawyer, Renfield, he says "I never drink... wine"! The Count himself later appears in the Buffy episode @{"Buffy Vs. Dracula" LINK "BUFFYVSDRACULA"}, and in a completely unrelated note, Bela Lugosi is also name-checked by the world's greatest ever metal band, Sepultura, in their song 'Bela Lugosi's Dead'.

@{b}Graudation Day - Part One@{ub}
3ABB21

Graduation Day has finally arrived, and everybody has a different perspective on it. Cordelia's concerned about the color of their graduation gowns, Buffy doesn't quite get the whole graduation deal, and Xander, who woke up with a bad feeling in his gut, fears he won't survive Graduation Day. He's found out that Mayor Wilkins will be their commencement speaker. Faith isn't concerned about graduation, but she does have an interest in college. She pays a visit to Professor Worth, a professor at the college. The Mayor wants him dead, and Faith handles the job.

While enduring his final classes, Xander mentions the Ascension to classmate Anya, and her ears perk up. She knows about it, and Xander brings her to the library, where Buffy, Giles and Wesley are trying to figure out why the Mayor killed Professor Worth. Xander announces to them that Anya not only knows something about the Ascension... she's the only living person who's been to one.

She tells them that about 800 years ago, in the Koskov Valleys above the Urals, there was a sorcerer there who achieved Ascension. He became the embodiment of the demon Lohesh, and she was there to witness it. Lohesh, a four-winged soul killer, decimated the village within hours; only a small handful of people survived. Anya explains that an Ascension means that a human being becomes pure demon. She tells them that all the demons that walk the earth are tainted, or human hybrids like vampires, but that a pure demon is different. She doesn't think this sounds like Lohesh, though, because the rituals are all different. Just as she says this, the Mayor bursts into the library.

The Mayor begins to talk about how powerful he'll be once the Ascension happens. Buffy makes a remark, and the Mayor responds by saying when the Ascension comes, he'll eat her. Giles, incensed by this, stabs the Mayor with his fencing foil. Of course, this doesn't affect the Mayor, who merely pulls the blade from his chest and walks away, grinning about his commencement address.

With the graduation ceremonies fast approaching, everyone's getting nervous. Anya, who has seen what an Ascension is like, plans to skip town, though Xander tries to get her to stay and help. She proposes to him that he could leave with her, and tries to persuade him to come, but he's committed to staying to help his friends, and declines. Buffy is also anxious, and tries to convince her mom to leave town, saying she won't be able to concentrate on stopping the Mayor if she has to worry about her mom. She doesn't want to leave, but Buffy finally convinces her. Willow, who is researching in the hopes of finding a spell to stop the Ascension, is nervous, too. To help her relax some, Oz plants a passionate kiss on her. Soon they are making love. As they lie together afterwards, they both agree that everything feels different now.

At Professor Worth's apartment, Buffy is investigating, trying to find some information that may be helpful, and Angel comes to help her out. They gather a box of documents, and prepare to take it to Giles. Outside the professor's apartment, Buffy and Angel talk about their relationship, and Buffy expresses her frustration. Suddenly an arrow pierces Angel through the back. We see that Faith has shot the arrow. When Buffy tries to help Angel up, he collapses; he's sweating, burning up. The arrow is poisoned, he tells her. In a panic, Buffy rushes Angel back to the library.

At the library, Giles and Wesley are discussing why the professor's research was of interest to the Mayor. He was doing research in old lava beds near a dormant volcano, and he found a large carcass buried underneath by an eruption. In his paper, Professor Worth suggests that the carcass may be some heretofore-undiscovered dinosaur. Giles thinks that perhaps it could also be a demon, which would explain why the Mayor would want to keep this kind of information secret - if the carcass was a demon, then it means that the demon can be killed, which would mean that the mayor is only impervious to harm until the Ascension. Once he's in demon form, he could be killed.

Buffy brings Angel back to the library for help tended. Willow is summoned to figure out what was on the arrow Faith shot Angel with. Wesley contacts the Council to see if they can help, but he returns to tell Buffy that they said they wouldn't help - it's not Council policy to cure vampires. Buffy is defiant, but Wesley explains that they're talking about laws that are older than civilization. Buffy says she doesn't care how old the laws are, she's talking about watching her lover die. The Council's orders, Wesley reminds her, are to concentrate on the Ascension. Buffy says she doesn't think she's going to be taking any more orders, from Wesley or the Council, and tells Wesley that she's not working for them anymore. Wesley pleads with her, arguing that Faith poisoned Angel to distract Buffy, and now the strategy is working. Buffy replies that she has a strategy of her own, and Wesley is not in it. This is mutiny, Wesley cries. Buffy says she likes to think of it as her graduation.

Willow, meanwhile, has figured out what the poison is - its Latin name translates to "killer of the dead." Oz finds that the only cure for it is to drain the blood of a slayer. Buffy has an idea: she'll get Faith's blood, and she'll kill her first if she has to. No more playing around, she says, she's ready to take on Faith to the death. Opening the closet in the library, she removes a dagger - the one the Mayor gave Faith, the one Faith used to kill one of the creatures from the Box of Gavroc in the cafeteria when the box was exchanged for Willow - and takes it with her. Oz and Willow figure out where Faith's apartment is, and Buffy heads there for the confrontation.

The Mayor, meanwhile, is busy preparing for the Ascension by performing the Ritual of Gavroc. Sitting at his desk in his office, he gleefully devours the creatures from the Box of Gavroc, feeling stronger with each one he eats.

Buffy arrives at Faith's apartment, and the battle soon begins. The furious fight leads them crashing through the window of Faith's apartment and onto a lower roof below. When they land, Buffy slaps handcuffs onto Faith's wrist, and the other cuff is already attached to her own wrist. The fight continues between the two handcuffed slayers until Faith breaks the cuffs apart. Buffy staggers back, and pulls out Faith's dagger. They tangle some more, and the fight moves toward the edge of the roof. As they peer over the ledge, Buffy stabs Faith. Faith, stumbling, steps on to the ledge, leans back and says goodbye, falling back into a passing truck. Buffy rushes to the ledge, but she's too late. The truck, with Faith, and her slayer's blood which Buffy needs to save Angel, is driving away... @{"[to be continued...]" LINK "GDAY2"}

There are definite indications that fatigue is closing in as the series reaches its finale. A strange mood shrouds the first two thirds of the episode: the performances are unusually stilted; the dialogue is peppered with woefully poor lines, and all the show's rhythms seem adrift. (I disagree. The episodes aren't shot one-by-one anyway - Ed). If this was an effort to create an ominous tone, in order to build tension, it isn't terribly successful. It takes an inordinate amount of time before the gears click into place: the pace only begins to pick up as the climactic showdown between Buffy and Faith begins.

Although the individual pieces never quite seem to fit together, 'Graduation Day - Part 1' provides some very memorable scenes to relish: Faith's chilling cold-blooded murder of Professor Worth is an event that would have been almost inconceivable a few episodes ago; "evil girl" Anya's romantic scene with Xander ("When I think that something could happen to you it feels bad inside, like I might vomit") is very funny, and demonstrates the character's potential.

There's a commendable atmosphere of genuine menace during the scene where the mayor ("call me Richard") visits the library. The funniest moment in the episode, though, is the scene in the library, when Giles and Xander unfold the illustration of Olvikan.

'Graduation Day - Part 1' seems half-hearted. For all its hints of what the Ascension might entail, we know that it's eventually going to be something that the show is going to have to achieve with a TV-show size budget.

The episode ends on a note that demonstrates the lack of energy present: Buffy knows that she needs the blood of a Slayer to cure Angel. She's tracked Faith down, has mortally wounded her in a bruising confrontation, and yet she watches, apparently helpless, as Faith quietly escapes on the back of a lorry...

@{b}Trivia @{ub}

Pop culture: Xander's line in the library, as he sees the foldout illustration of the demon Olvikan, "We're going to need a bigger boat" misquotes Steven Spielberg's terrific 1975 movie 'Jaws'. The line is one of the most famous quotes in cinema history. The line is delivered by police chief Brody (Roy Schneider), just after has caught his first glimpse of a great white shark that's been terrorizing a small coastal town: "You're going to need a bigger boat!"

Willow's vain hope that Siegfried and Roy might be the speakers at the graduation ceremony is a reference to a pair of flamboyant magicians who perform in a spectacular Las Vegas show. They are famous for their elaborate costumes, and their menagerie of big cats, including white tigers.

Follows on from @{"Graduation Day - Part One" LINK "GDAY1"}.

After the climactic battle on the roof of Faith's apartment building, Buffy stands alone with the knife that may have killed Faith. As the reality of not being able to use Faith's blood as a cure for Angel sets in, Buffy has a moment of painfully quiet introspection, then leaves, having made her decision internally. Just as Buffy descends the escape ladder, the Mayor and one of his goons search the apartment looking for Faith. The apartment is in a shambles, and although the Mayor tries to convince himself that Faith will prevail in the fight, his fear is written all over his face. Back at the library, Xander and Giles research how to defeat the Mayor in demon form when Cordelia barges in demanding an explanation of why Wesley has decided to leave the country. After Giles explains that Wesley is no longer Buffy's watcher, Xander manages to convince Cordy to join in the fight against the Mayor. Meanwhile, Willow cares for Angel back at his hideout, but things don't look so good for Angel. When he wakes up from a troubled sleep, he mistakes Willow for Buffy. When the real Buffy shows up, she asks Willow and Oz to leave so that she can be alone with Angel.

When they leave, she explains to Angel that the only way for him to survive is to drink her blood. Angel emphatically resists, but after Buffy physically induces his vampire side to come out, he sinks his fangs into her neck and drains her near to death. When Angel comes to and realizes what he has done, he rushes Buffy to the hospital and demands that the doctors treat her immediately.

In the next room, the Mayor grieves over Faith, who lies in a coma. When a doctor comes in announcing another girl with 'severe blood loss' in the other room, he puts two and two together. He walks very calmly over to Buffy and tries to suffocate her, but Angel comes to the rescue. The Mayor warns Angel that at Graduation he will do much worse to Buffy, then storms out. Just as the Mayor exits, Giles, Xander, Oz and Willow meet Angel in the hall. Seeing that Angel's health has been restored, they question Buffy's condition and Angel's sudden recovery, and soon learn that Buffy's blood was the cure for Angel's ailments. While both Giles and Xander both strongly disapprove of Angel's actions, they know they must focus on the Ascension.

In a strange and surreal dream, Faith is alive and well, and gives Buffy some valuable advice: 'human weakness' is the key to defeating the Mayor. Questioning whether Faith's mind or her own mind is creating this fantasy, she drifts out of her sleep and wakes up in the hospital. She wanders over to Faith's bed and gives her an apologetic kiss, then meets the gang in the waiting room. Startled to see her up so soon, they are even more startled when she says that she is 'ready for war.'

At the library, Buffy goes over her plan with Giles, Angel, Xander, Willow, Oz and Cordelia. Wesley unexpectedly walks in, and before Buffy and the gang can ostracize him, he explains that he has not come back representing the council; he is back to help. Meanwhile, the Mayor plans his assault with his vampire goons. The vamps are told to hold the people in the area so that the Mayor can feed on them once the ascension is complete.

Back at the school, the gang goes to work rounding up students to help with the battle. Willow grabs Percy and Xander rounds up Harmony while Wesley and Cordelia share a hilariously awkward romantic good-bye in the library. In another sort of good-bye, Angel tells Buffy that if they survive the Ascension, he will not say good-bye, he will simply leave.

The big day finally arrives, and the students file in wearing their crimson caps and gowns. Anxiety and fear paint the faces of Buffy and the gang while Principal Snyder gives his usual condescending banter, then introduces Mayor Wilkins as the honored guest speaker. The Mayor begins his speech about graduation, ascension and change, but before he can finish, the ascension begins.

The moon eclipses the sun, bringing darkness over the ceremony. And before a stunned crowd, the Mayor morphs into a giant, twenty-foot dinosaur with a vicious set of teeth and a ravenous appetite. But amid the ensuing chaos, the student body is ready. Led by Buffy and a courageous Xander, the students rip off their gowns to reveal an arsenal of weapons. They bombard the demon and his vampire minions with flame-throwers, rifles, arrows, spears and swoads. In the melee, the demon dips down and grabs Principal Snyder between his jaws, and devours him. Buffy sees her chance, and orders the class to retreat. Now one on one with the Mayor, she taunts him with the knife that pierced Faith, and leads him on a chase through the high school. The chase ends in the library, which is rigged with explosives. All the Mayor can say is "Oh, gosh!" as he and the halls of Sunnydale High are blown back into hell.

In the aftermath, Giles congratulates Buffy on the victory, and presents her diploma that he pulled from the wreckage. As Giles leaves to check on the injured Wesley, Buffy spots Angel standing at a distance. They exchange a long, painful look, but before Buffy can approach Angel to say good-bye, he walks away and disappears into the smoky haze. Later that night, Buffy, Xander, Willow, Oz and Cordelia take a moment to reflect on the fact that they have not only survived the battle, but they have survived high school.

If 'Graduation Day Part 2' had been the last ever episode of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer', there wouldn't have been too many fans who wouldn't have gracefully admitted that at least the series ended with a suitably epic finale.

Of course, there was never any doubt that the series would continue, but there must have been some considerable pressure to at least acknowledge that the cast was almost three years older than they were when the series began, and that the series couldn't maintain the status quo indefinitely.

Additionally, there was the imminent prospect of giving Angel his own spin-off series to deal with, so a few loose ends would have to be gathered together before the episode ended. Writer and director Joss Whedon has managed to juggle all these demands most adeptly.

Although the lasting impression is of an action-packed story, it's interesting to note that we don't even get to the Graduation Day arena until half way through the episode.

When the action does eventually begin it's fast and furious, and on a most impressive scale. Whedon's direction is faultless, although there are a few potentially important blink-and-you' ll-miss-it moments that pass very quickly (Larry's death and Harmony being bitten by a vampire, for example).

The most notable scene, however, is one that isn't there: it's to Whedon's credit that he resisted the urge to include a drawn-out, tearful and gushy parting scene between Angel and Buffy. With Ascension Day upon them, there were more important things to focus on.

It's time to make special note of the contributions made by two performers who take their final bow here. As Principal Snyder, an obvious casualty of the series' move to a new venue, Armin Shimerman has been a delight in the all-too few episodes he appeared in.

Harry Groener's character (mayor Richard Wilkins III) was erratically written, but Groener managed to maintain a steadily growing sense of menace throughout, and in this episode he finally steals the show.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Culture references: Faith's line "Miles to go. Little Miss Muffet counting down from 7-3-0", which Buffy says is a riddle, contains two references. "Miles to go", which also appeared in 'The Prom' (written by Marti Noxon), is a quote from "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening", a poem by American writer Robert Frost (1874-1963), who is best known for his portraits of rural life in New England.

"Little Miss Muffet" is from the nursery rhyme, of course, and may have been a reminder of the mayor's spider-eating habits. Various theories have been proposed to explain "7-3-0", since it has not been clarified in the context of the series. The most credible note that 730 is two times 365, and it may teasingly refer to something that will happen in two years' time.

Several continuity references are made during the episode. Xander's memories of being "soldier guy" come from his adventures in 'Halloween'; the reference to a rocket launcher relates to the gang's method of killing The Judge, in 'Innocence'.

The most intriguing reference is arguable, since it may simply be coincidental. When Buffy visits the comatose Faith in hospital, she kisses her forehead. Something similar happened in 'Enemies', at the climax of a fight between Buffy and Faith. (Faith tells Buffy "What are you gonna do, B, kill me? You become me. You're not ready for that yet!" She then kisses Buffy on the forehead, and runs away...)

At the end of the episode the Mutant Enemy Inc logo creature is wearing a mortarboard. This is the third time that there's been a deviation from the norm: the other two were in @{"Amends" LINK "AMENDS"} and @{"Becoming - Part Two" LINK "BECOMING2"}.

"I don't know what the hell's going on!" - Oz

With their first semester at the University of California - Sunnydale almost upon them, Buffy waits in the cemetery for a vampire to rise while Willow helps her register for classes. One class they're taking together is a psychology course taught by Professor Walsh, who has an impressive reputation. Distracted with course selection for a moment, Buffy fails to notice her intended target rising out of his grave. The vampire attempts to sneak up on Buffy and Willow from behind, but the sight of their arsenal of stakes, arrows, and crosses forces him to find a meal elsewhere.

On the morning of her first day of college, Buffy finds herself overwhelmed by the sheer size of UC-Sunnydale. While wandering around in a vain attempt to find a building, Buffy bumps into Willow, who is considerably more excited with the college experience. Soon after, they find Oz standing about. Having played on campus several times with his band, Oz has gotten fairly acquainted with the setting, enough to know more than a few faces walking around. Buffy and Willow check out the library, which is enormous in comparison to Sunnydale High's. On the way there, Willow updates Buffy on what Giles and Xander have been up to over the summer. While Xander set out on a mission to drive across America, Giles has been enjoying his unemployed status. After the library, Buffy and Willow head to the bookstore. There, they meet Riley, one of Prof. Walsh's T.A.'s for the psych class they're taking. Willow impresses Riley with her present knowledge of the subject. Riley leads her over to another section of the bookstore, leaving Buffy with nothing to do but tag along. Afterwards, Buffy returns to her dorm room and meets her roommate, Kathy, who has just moved in. Although a fairly nice person, Buffy finds her to be a little too enthusiastic. She also isn't too thrilled with the Celine Dion poster that Kathy puts up on the wall. That night, Buffy learns the hard way that Kathy is an obnoxiously loud sleeper.

The next day, Buffy attends a pop culture class that she hasn't registered for yet. While asking a nearby student if there are any openings left in the class, Buffy attracts the attention of Prof. Riegert, who makes it crystal clear that Buffy has no chance of getting into the class. He then orders her to leave the room immediately. On her way to psych class, Buffy runs into Riley just outside the classroom. Although he remembers Willow perfectly, Riley has trouble recalling meeting Buffy the previous day, let alone her name.

Inside, Buffy takes a seat next to Willow and Oz. At the start of class, Prof. Walsh informs the students that her class is anything but a blow-off course. Later that night, Buffy meets another student by the name of Eddie. Besides taking Psych 105 together, what Buffy and Eddie also have in common is their general discomfort with college life so far. While they walk towards their respective dorm rooms, Buffy and Eddie discuss security blankets that get them through the daily grind. For Eddie, it's a copy of "Of Human Bondage" that he always keeps near his bed. After they part ways, Eddie has an unfortunate run-in with a gang of vampires, led by a blonde named Sunday. Shortly after, the vampires rob Eddie's room of all of his belongings. They leave a forged good-bye note on the bed before splitting.

At psych class the next day, Buffy tries to find Eddie in the class, but to no avail. She goes to Eddie's residence hall. Eddie's R.A. takes Buffy to the room and shows her the space that's completely empty, save for the note on the bed. Buffy reads the note while the R.A. tells her that it's fairly common for some freshman to take off this early. Before she leaves, Buffy finds Eddie's copy of "Of Human Bondage" in his nightstand. Meanwhile, Sunday and her vampire lackeys sift through Eddie's stuff. Disappointed with their findings, Sunday decides that she needs someone else to find a better victim, and the just-turned Eddie is her choice for the job. She heads to Giles' apartment for help, but soon learns that Giles is not alone in the apartment. Dressed only in one of Giles' dress shirts, an old friend named Olivia greets Buffy as she enters the apartment. When Giles steps out, Olivia leaves the two of them alone in the living room. Buffy tells Giles about the missing student. In response, Giles reminds her that without a Watcher officially assigned to her anymore, Buffy will have to take care of such matters by herself. Later that night, Buffy sees Eddie walking around the campus. When she catches up with him, Buffy realizes Eddie is no longer the human student she met the previous night. After a short fight, Buffy finishes Eddie with a stake to the heart. The Slayer soon realizes that she has an audience.

Spinning around, Buffy meets Sunday. While the rest of the vampire gang surrounds Buffy, Sunday battles the Slayer one-on-one. In no time, Buffy realizes that this fight is much more difficult than she expected it to be. When Sunday gains the upper hand by snapping her opponent's left arm, Buffy decides to retreat. That night, the unbearable pain in her arm makes it impossible for Buffy to sleep. The next morning, Buffy sees Willow and Oz having a pleasant conversation with another student. Instead of joining her friends, Buffy turns the other way and heads home. Joyce is surprised to see her daughter home this early in the semester. After Buffy learns that her room has been filled with her mother's crates from the gallery, the phone rings in the kitchen. Buffy answers the phone, but no voice comes from the other end of the line.

Buffy hangs up and goes back to her dorm room, only to find that all of her stuff has been stolen. A good-bye note similar to Eddie's rests on her bed. Down in the dumps, Buffy heads to the Bronze. For a split second, Buffy thinks she sees Angel standing at the bar, but a second glance reveals it to be a complete stranger. Suddenly, Xander surprises Buffy with his unannounced presence. Xander tells Buffy the story of his summer vacation, which involved a road trip that pretty much never happened, his car dying in the middle of nowhere, and a job at a ladies' club that, for one evening, forced Xander to join the ranks of male strippers. Realizing that Buffy shouldn't even be in the Bronze, Xander gets her to confess her troubles at school. Knowing that her self-confidence is shot, Xander tells Buffy that she's been nothing but a magnificent inspiration, and that he considers Buffy his hero. With her spirits lifted, Buffy uses Xander's assistance to track down Sunday to an abandoned fraternity house. They spy on the vampires through a skylight on the roof. Unable to see her weapons chest, Buffy sends Xander back to her dorm room to retrieve the necessary equipment. After Xander takes off, the skylight gives way under Buffy's weight, sending the Slayer down onto the hard floor below.

While Buffy tries to fight Sunday again, Willow and Oz read the note on Buffy's bed while Kathy wonders what's going on. Fearing that they somehow drove Buffy away, Willow drowns herself in guilt. Xander suddenly arrives and subtly hints to Willow and Oz that Buffy is in trouble. Unable to find the weapons chest in the room, they head for Willow's room to get supplies. Back at the frat house, Buffy spots her weapons chest in the corner of the room. Before she can reach it, Sunday steps in front of her and holds up the Class Protector award. When Sunday breaks it, Buffy goes into overdrive, using a flurry of kicks and one-armed attacks on the hapless vampire. The rest of the gang tries to make a run for it, but Xander, Willow, and Oz arrive just in time to reduce them to dust. After taking the fight out of Sunday, Buffy sends the vampire flying across the room with a punch from the same arm that Sunday thought was broken. Xander, Willow, and Oz watch as Buffy hurls a stake right through Sunday's heart. After gathering all of Buffy's stuff, the gang heads outside to see Giles running towards them, carrying several weapons in his arms. Giles apologizes to Buffy for trying to teach her a lesson in independence. He vows to help the Slayer out in any fight that comes her way. While the gang heads back to Buffy's dorm room, one of Sunday's vampire lackeys that managed to escape roams through the park. Suddenly, he is hit by a couple of taser shots. The electric volts send him to the ground, immobilized. As the vampire watches, an anonymous team approaches him, dressed in black and carrying rifles.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

It's rather appropriate that BBC TWO have begun the fourth season of "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" straight after the third, because it only heightens the dizzying sense of disorientation that "The Freshman" seeks to convey; a feeling that will be familiar to anyone who's ever had to acclimatise to a new environment. American audiences may have had the luxury of a three-month hiatus since their transmission of "Graduation Day - Part 2" (albeit one interrupted by the overdue transmission of "Earshot") but they also had the advantage of being more familiar with the lobster quadrille that seems to accompany starting college.

So much has changed since the gang graduated that the reorientation process takes up great chunks of this episode. Considerable time is devoted to laying the foundations for this season's arc story, too, so it's to Whedon's credit that he still manages to find space to work in a robust story, with interesting characters, (how many people were surprised when Sunday and her gang got dusted at the end of the episode?)

The change of venue, the advent of new characters (Kathy, Riley, Professor Walsh and Olivia) and the newly stirred-up relationships between the lead characters is initially quite giddying. Many fans will be disappointed that the established status quo has been shattered, but most will accept the inevitability that the series has to move on if it's to remain fresh and vibrant.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Pop culture #1: Xander refers to the 1991 movie "Grand Canyon", a film directed by Lawrence ("The Big Chill") Kasdan, and starring Steve Martin, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover. Despite what Xander has to say about it, it's generally regarded as a pretty good film.

Pop culture #2: Xander's line about the "purple mountains majesty" of America quotes from Katharine Lee Bates' stirring 1893 hymn "America the Beautiful", which contains the lyric:
@{i}O' beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain @{ui}

Pop culture #3: Xander's "anger leads to hate" speech misquotes the concerns voiced by Yoda (Frank Oz) in "Star Wars - Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace". The final line Xander was grasping for is "hate leads to suffering". The line "first you get the women, then you get the money" misquotes Brian De Palma's 1983 movie "Scarface", which contains the following line delivered by Al Pacino's character, Tony Montana: "[In] this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the woman". (Incidentally, in an earlier draft of the film's script, Tony's line is "To get women you gotta get the Money first, then you get Power and when you got Power, then you get Women...")

The scene where Sunday rummages through Buffy's belongings raises a number of continuity references: Buffy's cuddly toy pig, Mr Gordo, was introduced in "What's My Line - Part 1". The gold parasol presented to Buffy by her fellow students in "The Prom", in recognition of her role as class protector. Buffy's diary was featured in "Ted" and "Angel". Meanwhile, over in "Angel"...: the scene where Buffy picks up the telephone, but there's no-one on the other end links this episode of "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" with the "Angel" pilot episode "City of", where Angel rings Buffy, but does not speak to her.

@{b}General comments on season four@{ub}

Despite the transition from high school to college and the relocation of Angel and Cordelia, the beloved Scooby Gang is still the close-knit group of guardians against the evils of the Hellmouth that we have come to know. After the near-apocalypse of the Mayor's Ascension, Buffy and Willow moved to the bigger and brighter halls of UC Sunnydale for their first taste of college life, where they joined Oz, who had previously adjusted to new campus with the success of his band, Dingoes Ate My Baby. After returning from a relatively uneventful and equally unlucky summer road trip, Xander returned to Sunnydale, only to move into his parents' basement and try to mingle with the college crowd without being recognized as a "townie." Giles, after the untimely destruction of the Sunnydale High School library, decided to live a bachelor's life and do what he always wanted to do: not work (reluctantly considered a valid lifestyle by the rest of the Scooby Gang).

The introduction of college life has brought many new people and challenges into the life of Buffy and the Scooby Gang, including the Teacher's Assistant-by-day and secret-military-commando-by-night Riley Finn and the ex-revenge-demon-turned-Xander-obsessed Anya, along with many others. And while the Scooby Gang may not look exactly like they did a year ago, their purpose remains the same: to protect the unknowing inhabitants of Sunnydale from the evils of the Hellmouth (and hang out at the Bronze).

4ABB02

After hearing Cher's "Believe" for the umpteenth consecutive time, Buffy decides it's time for her nightly patrol. She tells Kathy that she's going out for a cup of coffee. Before Buffy can make it out of the room, Kathy mentions that some of the milk in their fridge is missing. Buffy confesses and takes off from Stevenson Hall. Outside, Buffy meets up with Willow, who listens to her friend talk about the trials of living with a new roommate.

While Buffy and Willow part ways, a demon with orange wrinkled skin and glowing green eyes watches from behind the bushes. A sound nearby kicks Buffy into alert mode, but she soon realizes that it's only Kathy, who has decided to join Buffy for a drink. Suddenly, Buffy hears what is undoubtedly a growl. She pushes Kathy out of the way just as a demon attacks her. Buffy fights back, finally forcing the demon to retreat. As Buffy helps an unsuspecting Kathy out of the bushes, the demon rejoins his partner. They believe that they have finally found the one they've been after.

The next day, Buffy visits Giles at his apartment. After she describes the demon to Giles, he wonders why Buffy is there instead of at school. Buffy admits that she's staying out of the dorm until Kathy goes to class. Meanwhile, Kathy futilely attempts to remove the stains on her sweater from the previous night. Giving up, she decides to take a look through Buffy's closet. Kathy finds a sweater to her liking, then notices Buffy's weapons bag on the floor of the closet. Later, Buffy cuts into the cafeteria line in an attempt to avoid Kathy, who is standing further down the line. The student whom Buffy cut off, Parker, decides to introduce himself. He gives Buffy a lesson on how to effectively utilize their meal cards. At the end of the line, Parker heads towards his friend's table, while Buffy joins Willow, Oz, and Xander at the other end of the dining room. During their conversation, Kathy takes it upon herself to join the group at their table, uninvited. Buffy quickly recognizes what Kathy's wearing, who believes that it's only fair since Buffy caused the stains on her own sweater. As Kathy tells the others about herself, Buffy watches in horror as a glob of ketchup falls from Kathy's hamburger onto the sweater.

That night, Willow tries to talk on the telephone while her roommate throws a party at the same time. On the other end of the line, Buffy throws out more complaints about her roommate. Hearing Kathy just outside the door, Buffy hangs up. While Kathy sits on the bed and flosses her teeth, Buffy tries to fit her apple into the stuffed fridge, in which every item is labeled with Kathy's name, including each individual egg. When Buffy turns around, she realizes that Kathy has closed her window. Buffy opens it back up and hits the sack. After falling asleep, Buffy has a dream about a demon placing a scorpion on her stomach, pouring blood down her throat, and sucking a mysterious light out of her mouth.

In the morning, Buffy tells Giles and the others about her dream. Kathy appears and tells them about a dream she had the previous night. While Giles and the gang are shocked to hear a description of the exact same dream, Buffy is more concerned with her growing irritation and hatred for Kathy. Later that night, the two green-eyed demons stand before a fire and begin to summon another named Tapparich. When Buffy returns to her dorm room, she finds Parker talking to Kathy inside. Apparently, they have been talking and getting to know each other for quite some time before Buffy walked in. After Parker leaves, Buffy and Kathy face off once again. This time, Buffy decides to help herself to as much of Kathy's carton of milk as she can handle. Elsewhere, Willow worries about Buffy steady change in personality. Oz tells her that he'll go find Buffy and see what's up. On his way to Buffy's patrol route, Oz passes by a group of students. One of them, a short girl, draws Oz's attention for a brief moment. As Oz looks back, the girl also does a double take with Oz, sensing something. Figuring it's nothing, Oz continues forward, failing to notice the army of rifle-carrying soldiers running towards the girl and her friends. During the patrol, Buffy tries to put her hatred for Kathy into words, but she only ends up destroying a park bench with a kick of pure hatred. Before going to bed, Buffy tries to get some reading homework done. However, Kathy's toenail clipping proves way more distracting than it should be. In retaliation, Buffy starts tapping her pencil. What follows is Cher's "Believe", Buffy's earmuffs, and the torturous crunching of Kathy's hard-boiled egg shell. Having had enough, Buffy goes to bed and has the same nightmare she had the previous night.

Buffy wakes up the next morning to see Kathy squirming in her bed, apparently having the same dream. Later, Willow talks to Kathy in the dorm hallway about Buffy. Seeing Buffy approaching, Kathy takes off. Willow then listens in fearful concern as Buffy declares that Kathy is evil and must be killed. Buffy tries to explain that she took a sample of Kathy's toenail clippings and realized that they continued to grow by themselves. However, Willow has already concluded that her friend has gone off the deep end. Willow tells her to talk to Giles, then calls him up to warn him of Buffy's arrival. Buffy enters Giles' apartment and is greeted by a falling net from above. Giles, Xander, and Oz rush out to restrain Buffy with ropes, fearing that her murder plan must be stopped at all costs. Buffy leads Giles to the toenail clippings in her bag and tries to convince them that she's right.

However, Giles believes that Buffy has been possessed by the demon she fought in the woods. While Xander and Oz take positions as watch guards over the restrained Slayer, Willow tries to warn Kathy about Buffy's intentions. Kathy's response of Buffy's come- uppance only scares Willow more, and she leaves shortly after getting a call from Oz. Back at the apartment, Buffy frees herself from the ropes and tricks Xander and Oz into coming close enough for her to knock them out.

Buffy returns to the dorm room in hopes of finishing Kathy once and for all. When Kathy lands a hard backhand against her roommate's face, Buffy grabs her by the face and pulls with all her might. The human skin comes off, revealing the same kind of demon that Buffy encountered several nights ago. While they battle, Xander and Oz regain consciousness just as Willow arrives at the apartment. Back at the dorm, Kathy informs Buffy that she escaped from another dimension, and now her elders have followed her in hopes of bringing her back. The only way they can recognize one of their own is by sensing the absence of a soul, so Kathy has been sucking out Buffy's soul the past few nights. Giles learns of this Ritual of Mok'tagar through research and quickly checks the toenail clippings. Confirming their continuing growth, Giles goes out into the living room to tell Willow, Xander, and Oz what he has learned. Since Buffy has already escaped, Giles decides that he and Willow must perform a spell that will reverse the effects of the ritual. While Xander and Oz head towards the dorm, Buffy and Kathy tear up their room in the name of beating the crap out of each other. Just as Kathy attempts to finish her assimilation of Buffy's soul, Giles and Willow complete the spell. Buffy's soul leaves Kathy and returns to its original host. Suddenly, the demon Tapparich appears in their dorm room. Kathy tries to plead her case, but Tapparich has heard enough. He opens a portal that sucks Kathy and himself back into their own dimension.

Now that Kathy is officially no longer a student at UC-Sunnydale, Willow decides to leave her party-crazed roommate and move in with Buffy. Things are finally looking up, although a forbidden bite from Buffy's sandwich drives the Slayer to focus her evil eye on Willow.

Episode Synopsis by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

Films like 'Fatal Attraction', 'Pacific Heights' and 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle' helped popularise a sub-genre of thrillers featuring seemingly normal characters that turned into raving psychopaths. These were often referred to as the '...from Hell' movies (as in 'the mistress from Hell', 'the tenant from Hell', etc).

Now, with 'Living Conditions', writer Marti Noxon has taken the concept to its logical conclusion: having the character in question actually be a demon from another dimension! Dagney Kerr's nicely paced performance as Kathy helps sell the premise, but the story needed much longer to unfold, forcing Noxon to use many shortcuts to convey Buffy's creeping sense of paranoia. The result is a story with a rushed ending, short on subtlety and sorely lacking the wonderful dialogue nuances that characterise most episodes of the show.

It's encouraging to find the regular cast so casually back together again after the worrying indications in the last episode that it would be difficult for the writers to find reasonable excuses for them to continue working as a team. This episode generally dispenses with explanations, and flows better because of it.

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Pop culture #1: The scene where Oz and Xander discuss Buffy's flirty encounter with Parker contains several references to the two 'Terminator' movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. These include allusions to famous quotes from the films, including "hasta la vista, baby" and the ominous promise "I'll be back".

Pop culture #2: For a more measured approach to the 'roommate from Hell' story check out Barbet Schroeder's 1992 film 'Single White Female', starring Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh.

How many of you noticed that Oz was wearing a sheepskin coat?

4ABB03

While Dingoes Ate My Baby performs onstage at the Bronze, Willow listens to Buffy discuss her relationship with Parker, who is playing a game of pool not too far away. On his way out, Parker offers to walk Buffy back to the dorm, and she readily accepts. Outside, while Devon and Oz load their equipment into the van, Willow encounters Harmony for the first time since graduation. Suddenly, a sharp pain strikes Willow's neck as she discovers that Harmony is now a vampire, feeding off of her former classmate.

Before Harmony can take too much blood, Oz pulls her off of Willow, who immediately raises her cross. Harmony takes off, but not before warning Willow and Oz that her own boyfriend is going to be fairly upset. Meanwhile, Parker and Buffy discuss their pasts while walking to Stevenson Hall. When Parker notices the scar on her neck, Buffy tosses out a cover story about an angry puppy. Parker then tells Buffy that his father died a year ago. Stopping for a moment, Parker asks Buffy to join him at an upcoming party at one of the frat houses. Upon finally arriving at room 214 in Stevenson Hall, Parker and Buffy move in for a goodbye kiss. Their lips never touch, for Oz and Willow rush down the hallway to tell Buffy about Harmony. After Parker leaves, Willow describes the event while Oz cleans the wound and applies a band-aid. Little do they know that Harmony's boyfriend is none other than Spike.

The next morning, deep beneath the streets of Sunnydale, Spike goes over the city plans, planning his next course of tunneling. Frustrated and bored, Harmony persuades Spike to take her to a party for some fresh food. Later that night, while working a part-time job at Giles' apartment, Xander gets a surprise visit from Anya. Under the impression that they're a couple, Anya tells Xander about his constant presence in her dreams. Shocked and confused, Xander tries to convince Anya that they don't have a relationship. At the party, Parker and Buffy run into Spike and Harmony. After some brief introductions, Spike flees the scene. Buffy follows him outside and gets into a sparring-and-trash-talking session. Harmony arrives shortly, explaining that Drusilla left Spike once again. Before Spike can retreat, Harmony mentions the Gem of Amara. Furious, Spike grabs Harmony and leaves.

Buffy heads to the nearest phone and calls Giles to tell him about Spike, Harmony, and the Gem of Amara. Giles describes the gem as "the vampire equivalent of the Holy Grail", but he also explains that it doesn't actually exist. While Buffy heads back inside to find Parker, Anya visits Xander once again, this time in the basement of his house. When Xander reaches into the fridge to offer her a drink, Anya drops her dress to the floor while his back is turned. Paralyzed by what he sees after turning back around, Xander can only listen as Anya describes her plan to get him out of her mind once and for all: to have sexual intercourse with him. Xander tries to resist, but he soon crumbles and gives in to Anya's demands. Back at the party, Parker talks to Buffy about his beliefs on fate. Going with her instincts, Buffy passionately kisses Parker, then follows him back to his room for the night.

Buffy wakes up the next morning to find that she's alone in Parker's bed. As she tries to gather all of her clothes, Parker walks in with a few cups of coffee. Before Buffy leaves, Parker promises to give her a call later in the day. Buffy returns to her room, only to find Giles at the computer with Willow. Giles brings Buffy up-to-speed on his research concerning the Gem of Amara. From what he's learned, the gem may not only be real, but it could also be located in Sunnydale. After Giles leaves, Willow demands details about Buffy's night with Parker. At the Harris residence, Anya tells Xander that she's finally over him. When Xander mutters a simple "okay", Anya gets upset and leaves. Meanwhile, Harmony wakes up Spike by writing a love note on his back. In the tunnel, Spike and his vampire cohorts realize that they're close to the crypt they're looking for. As hours, then days, go by, Buffy constantly checks her answering machine, never getting a single message from Parker, while Spike finally drills through the ground of the crypt.

Inside the crypt, Spike approaches a beautiful necklace with a shining emerald in the middle of the room. While he puts it on, Harmony tries on various rings and tiaras. Spike reaches for a nearby cross, believing that the Gem of Amara has rendered him invincible to all vampire weaknesses. However, a burning pain accompanies Spike's handling of the cross. Fed up with Harmony's constant rambling, Spike tries to dust her with a make-shift stake. However, the hole in her chest quickly reseals. Spike immediately identifies the Gem of Amara on the ring that Harmony put on. He takes it from her and heads up to the surface, where the sun is still shining. While walking around campus, Buffy finds Parker telling the story of his deceased father to another pretty girl. Pulling him aside, Buffy tries to find out what's been going on. Parker informs Buffy that she mistook a little fun for a serious commitment. Crushed and dejected, Buffy watches Parker as he walks off. A familiar voice gets Buffy's attention, and she turns just in time to see Spike's fist. While they fight, Giles and the others follow a lead from a news report to the tunnels beneath Sunnydale, while Xander goes to Stevenson Hall to find Buffy. There, he runs into Anya, who he quickly brushes off due to current circumstances regarding Buffy's whereabouts.

Underground, Giles, Willow, and Oz question a distraught Harmony, but she flees before divulging Spike's location. Back above ground, Spike assaults Buffy both physically and verbally, ridiculing her failed relationship with Parker by likening it to the aftermath of her passionate night with Angel. Xander finds them and tries to help out, but Spike handles him effortlessly by throwing him into a nearby post. Buffy finally gains the upper hand and removes the Gem of Amara, causing Spike to suddenly retreat from the burning rays of sunlight.

Back at Giles' apartment, Buffy announces her decision to give the Gem of Amara to Angel. With a planned gig in Los Angeles, Oz agrees to take the ring with him. Later that night, Buffy tries to figure out with Willow what went wrong between Parker and herself. Deciding she needs some time alone, Buffy lets Willow go an ahead to the dorm room. Buffy silently walks down the sidewalks of UC-Sunnydale, confused and dejected.

Unbeknownst to Buffy, Anya and Harmony are doing the exact same thing. As the moon illuminates the otherwise dark campus, the lonely trio continues along, their paths never crossing.

@{b}More Information@{ub}

You can often tell a lot about where an episode of 'Buffy's priorities lie, and where the padding has been added, by dissecting its structure.

In this episode, for example, there's a pivotal scene almost exactly half way through, when Buffy sleeps with Parker. The first half of the episode leads up to the scene, and the rest deals with the fallout.

Spike's return is a welcome development. If the revelation itself is disappointingly understated, his beautifully written and performed scenes with Harmony more than live up to expectations.

If you were to remove this week's McGuffin (the gem of Amara) and the resultant daylight fracas between Spike and Buffy, you'll find a nicely-studied examination of the relationships developing between three odd couples:

Anya and Xander, Parker and Buffy, and Spike and Harmony. The fling between Parker and Buffy is a sharp contrast to her relationship with Angel, so who could blame viewers for unfavourably comparing the new with the old...?

@{b}Trivia@{ub}

Pop culture: Harmony asks: "Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?" Well, he was in the 1994 film adaptation of Anne Rice's 'Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles', which also starred Tom Cruise. In the film Banderas played Armand, a 400 year-old vampire who runs a theatre, where the vampire killings are passed off as stage illusions.

The album that Oz holds up when he says "More important than this one?" is the last Velvet Underground album to actively feature Lou Reed, 1970's 'Loaded'.

Continuity: There are plenty of notable continuity references. Harmony and Buffy chat about the "big snake" that threatened to spoil @{"Graduation Day - Part Two" LINK "GDAY2"}. It was during the melee at the end of this episode that Harmony was bitten and turned into a vampire.

Anya and Xander began dating in @{"The Prom" LINK "THEPROM"}, and the last time he saw her ("fleeing in terror") was in @{"Graduation Day - Part One" LINK "GDAY1"}. The scar on Buffy's neck - now you see it, now you don't - was the result of Angel's feeding, in @{"Graduation Day - Part Two" LINK "GDAY2"}. When Buffy tells Parker that she nearly drowned, she's referring back to 'Prophecy Girl'.

@{b}Fear, Itself@{ub}
4ABB04

On the night before Halloween, during a pumpkin-carving get-together at Xander's place, Buffy leaves the gang a little early to spend some time alone. Outside, Buffy knocks a demonic-looking figure to the ground. Still recovering from Parker's rejection, she barely reacts to the realization that it was merely a guy in his Halloween costume.

At school the next day, the sight of Parker drives Buffy out of the cafeteria just minutes into the lunch period. Willow tries to help out, but Buffy prefers the easy way out. Her growing preoccupation does not go unnoticed by Professor Walsh, who threatens to kick Buffy out of the class if she has any more absences. Riley suggests to Buffy that she should take a break from her worries and just have fun for Halloween. Meanwhile, Josh and Edward, two members of the Alpha Delt fraternity, prepare their house for a haunted party. While Josh puts the finishing touches on a knife-wielding skeleton, Edward hands over a bag of fake spiders, as well as a book that contains an appropriate symbol to add to the party's freaky ambience. When Josh complains about their stereo system's quality, Edward offers to call Oz to remedy the situation. After school, Oz brings his stereo over to the Alpha Delt house, with Xander tagging along. As Oz sets up the new sound system, Xander notices the symbol being painted on the floor of the attic by Chaz, another fraternity member. Oz accidentally cuts his finger while trying to tweak the sound quality by trimming the speaker wire. When he shakes some blood onto the floor, the painted symbol sends a rippling shockwave throughout the house that nobody notices. Suddenly, what was once a fake, plastic spider resting on the floor is now a living, walking creature.

Without a date of her own, Buffy feels left out as she accompanies the gang to the party. After being swayed from patrolling by Giles, Buffy wears an old Little Red Riding Hood costume, thanks to some last-minute alterations by Joyce. Willow embodies the persona of Joan of Arc in her medieval garb, while Oz completes the picture with his name tag reading "God". Sporting a James Bond-esque tuxedo, Xander tells the others that Anya, whom he invited earlier that day, will be a little late on account of costume-finding difficulty. The gang's stroll to the party is momentarily interrupted by the sudden appearance of masked commandos armed with rifles. They quickly turn and run, leaving the gang to mistake them for average Halloween celebrators. While Buffy and the others make their way to the fraternity house, the guests at the party soon realize that something is obviously not right. Bloody eyeballs, dead guests, and other horrific sights send the partygoers into chaos. In a rush to get away, Josh takes a fatal tumble down the main staircase, snapping his neck at the bottom step.

Moments later, Buffy, Xander, Willow, and Oz arrive. Real spiders and bats that appear to be fake at first quickly alert the gang to the trouble that lies ahead. Hidden inside a closet, they find Chaz huddled in the corner, too scared to come out. While trying to get any information from Chaz, Buffy fails to notice the skeleton that approaches from behind, the knife still in its hand. A slash at Buffy's back sends her into automatic pilot, flooring the enemy in one blow. Before it even hits the floor, the skeleton reverts to its plastic state.

After inspecting the attacker, Buffy realizes that the closet that Chaz was hiding in is nowhere in sight. Having had enough, Buffy orders the others to evacuate and get Giles for help. Willow disagrees, believing she can conjure a guiding spell that will lead them to where they need to go. Their argument splits the group in two, with Oz following Willow while Xander tries to support Buffy. However, Xander soon realizes that he can no longer be seen or heard by Buffy, who starts a search for her seemingly lost friend. Oz, in the meantime, begins to transform into his wolf state, despite the fact that the full moon is still weeks away. Unable to control himself, Oz lashes out at Willow before running off to prevent any more harm.

Outside, Anya finally arrives in a big, white bunny costume. Unable to find the front door where it's supposed to be, Anya walks around the house and spots a terrified guest screaming through one of the windows. As Anya looks on, the window suddenly vanishes from the facade. She immediately seeks out Giles, who goes through his books to find answers. After locating what he needs, Anya returns to the house with Giles, who employs a chain saw to get them inside. Meanwhile, Willow attempts the guiding spell. The appearance of a tiny, green sprite leads Willow to believe she succeeded. However, the sprite rapidly multiplies into an uncontrollable swarm that chases Willow from room to room. Elsewhere, a door mysteriously lands Buffy in the basement, where she finds herself restrained on the floor by the arms of zombies. As she struggles to break free, Josh appears and taunts her mercilessly. When Buffy finally escapes, she ends up in the attic, where the rest of the party guests shiver in fear. She finds Oz, who has returned to his human state. Willow arrives shortly, followed by Buffy's sighting of Xander in another corner of the room.

Back together, the gang tries to make sense of what's going on. Xander points out the symbol on the floor, which Willow identifies as the Mark of Gachnar, a fear demon. They conclude that their fears are being manifested so that Gachnar can enter their reality. Suddenly, a buzzing chain saw marks Giles and Anya's entrance into the attic. Giles produces the book he found on Gachnar, which describes several ways of preventing the summoning. Halfway through Giles' reading of a sentence involving the destruction of the symbol, Buffy sends her fist through the Mark of Gachnar. Unfortunately, the rest of Giles' reading informs Buffy that she has just brought forth Gachnar. A bright light shines through the hole in the floor, and the gang watches as Gachnar emerges... as a diminutive demon no taller than several inches. While suppressing her own laughter, Buffy puts a quick end to Gachnar with one stomp.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana

@{b}More Information@{ub}

This time around the set-up (a haunted house, and a costume party) provides a great backdrop to David Fury's inventive and fast-moving script. Viewers will be forgiven, though, for feeling a sense of déjà vu. Elements of 'Halloween' and, especially, season one's 'Nightmares', feel recycled.

Fury has said that 'Fear, Itself' is a companion piece to 'Nightmares', and that he decided not to directly revisit the fears that were portrayed in that episode. Having acknowledged that the gang had matured considerably in the two years since 'Nightmares', he felt that their fears would have changed accordingly.

The title comes from American President Franklin D. Roosevelt's inaugural address, on March 4th, 1933: "This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper... Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

Pop culture: Two movies are referred to at the beginning of the episode, for the gang's "second annual Halloween screening": the 1979 horror film 'Phantasm' and the rather less terrifying 1940 Walt Disney animated showcase 'Fantasia'.

Giles' line about the Frankenstein monster puppet, "It's alive!"(a statement later echoed by Chaz), is a quote from the 1931 Boris Karloff version of 'Frankenstein'. This is what Victor Frankenstein (Colin Clive) cries as his creation begins to stir.

When Oz and Xander are checking the loudspeakers, Xander asks: "You're sensing a disturbance in the force, master?" This is another reference to the 'Star Wars' movies. (It's very close to a line in the first film, where Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) reacts to the destruction of the planet Alderaan: "I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced").

In the middle of her psych class, Buffy daydreams about an uncharacteristically apologetic Parker, who begs her forgiveness after a surprise vampire attack. Professor Walsh's lecture snaps Buffy back to reality, and she looks down a few rows to see Parker putting his trademark moves on yet another female victim. After class, Xander finds Buffy and Willow and tells them of his recent employment as bartender at the campus pub.

That night, Buffy stops by the pub and sees Parker entertaining a girl at one of the booths. She bumps into Riley, who gives her the lowdown on Parker's womanizing habits. Buffy pulls up a stool at the bar, where Xander is finding some difficulty getting into the groove of the job. Fed up, Buffy is getting ready to leave when she is stopped by several guys who demand her presence at their table. Seeing Parker leave the pub with his latest prize, Buffy decides to accept the guys' offer. In no time, she finds herself guzzling several glasses of beer with her newfound friends. Meanwhile, at the Bronze, Willow notices Oz's overwhelming interest in the on stage band, Shy. He is particularly drawn to the lead singer, Veruca, a familiar girl who seems to share a mutual interest in Oz. Elsewhere, a man prepares a mixture of several chemicals and stores it in a keg of Black Frost beer, the same brand that Buffy was drinking with the guys earlier.

The next morning, Willow returns to the dorm and finds Buffy deeply fascinated by their television set. On their way out to psych class, Willow has to remind her roommate to get dressed. At class, Buffy eyes a classmate eating a sandwich. Buffy snatches the sandwich and hungrily scarfs it down. Later, Oz stops by Stevenson Hall and tells Willow that he's been invited by Veruca and her band to watch their show that night. Willow opts to take a pass, leaving Oz to go alone. While Oz heads to the Bronze, Willow decides to drop by the Grotto, where she finds Parker sitting by himself. She approaches Parker and proceeds to berate him for causing Buffy so much distress. In his defence, Parker tries to explain his philosophy of short-term relationships.

As Willow settles into the conversation, Buffy throws back another round of beers with the guys at the pub. Concerned with their increasingly primal behavior, Xander forces a reluctant Buffy to call it a night and head back to the dorm. Deciding that the other guys have had enough as well, Xander asks them to pay the bill. While he collects the money, one of the guys heads to the bathroom. Moments later, he emerges as a hairy, caveman- like grunt. While he knocks Xander to the floor, the others undergo similar transformations. Xander scares them off with his lighter, then runs into the back room to warn his boss, Jack. However, Jack reveals to Xander that he made the special formula in order to get back at the pretentious students.

Back at the Grotto, Parker attempts to lure Willow into seeing things his way. On the contrary, Willow doesn't buy his act for a second. Just as she's about to leave, the caveman storm into the grotto, dragging a couple of helpless girls inside with them. Before they can escape, Willow and Parker are knocked unconscious by the rampaging savages.

Meanwhile, Xander gets Giles and takes him to Buffy's dorm, hoping the beer hasn't transformed the Slayer yet. Upon entering the room, they find Buffy drawing figures on the wall and pounding her chest, although her physical features are still unchanged. Xander and Giles
