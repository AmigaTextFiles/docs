The YS App Proggies
===================

OK, to keep the archive size down, I haven't included any of these (except
the David Darling simulator, because that's really small)

You should be able to obtain them from Aminet as follows:-

Advanced Lawnmower Simulator - game/misc/mowersim.lha
  (a slight update to als.library is in util/libs/als_lib.lha)
  
Back Of The Grid: The Sinclair C5 Sim - game/misc/c5sim.lha

Everything Else - misc/misc/wierd.lha

Note:
Topaz-8 is some font preferences settings.  If any programs don't seem to
work as they should, then try running this (it will set all your fonts back
to the default Topaz/8 temporarily)
