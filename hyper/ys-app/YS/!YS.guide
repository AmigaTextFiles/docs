Sir Clive was born in 1940,  the son of a wealthy fruit and veg salesman and
a French nurse.  His life was boring until he invented the pocket calculator
in  1976,  after which he succeeded in inventing lots more things.  In 1989,
Sir  Clive  was  engaged to 'Curvy Bernadette Tynan' (22,   pictured  left).
However,  she called the wedding off later that year.  Sir Clive  has  since
been spotted 'on the town' with a series of other stunners.  Looks like he's
quids in!!

The original Spectrum:  The inspiration behind a million home computers.  It
is  said that Bill Gates modelled MS-DOS on the Spectrum +3.  God knows how.
The  first (nearly)  spectrum,  pictured left,  had only 16k of RAM and  was
expandable  to  a  maximum of 48k.  So it wasn't too  good.   But  it  still
continues  to  capture the hearts of small tribes living  in  the  Brazilian
rainforests.

As  well as being a fully fledged inventor,  dear old Uncle Clive is also  a
professional in the internationally acknowledged sport of C5 racing,   which
is  a  bit like Formula 1 only with C5s.  Last year he came 2nd in the World
Championships  which  were held in Cirencester,  Wiltshire,   where  he  was
beaten by the current No 1 C5 racer,  Paul Shane,  from TV's Oh Dr Beeching!
Clive  did however pip many other hopefuls at the post,  such as the  former
Daily  Mirror  editor  Piers Morgan and American  law-breaking  'Film  Star'
Traci  Lords.   The  bookies' favourite for  the  race  was  newsreader  and
University  Challenge presenter Jeremy Paxman,  but he span  off  the  track
after  lap  27.  Click the button above-right to see a clip from  the  race,

it would be like to see Sir Clive racing in his own invention.

Hello,   and welcome to a special edition of Local Heroes.  This  week  I've
come  to London.  Now,  many of you will be watching Local Heroes on a  flat
screen TV.  You undoubtably will have been plagued with the problems of  the
old style screen,  and wanted a solution.  My first hero this week also  had
this  problem,  and longed for a solution.  In 1985 he patented (I've always
wondered whether you pronounce that 'patent' or 'patent'.  According to  the
Oxford english dictionary it's pronounced 'patent',  but the people  at  the
patent  offices say 'patent'.)  his design for the first ever  flat  screen.
His  name  is Sir Clive Sinclair.  (cue old drawing of Sir Clive,   complete
with  his name and date of living printed in an old script-type font)   It's
in  this  house (dismounts bike)  in King's Cross that Clive first  produced
these plans (holds up some plans)  for his flat screen.  Now I've used these
original  plans  to make my own flat screen TV out of old scraps.   You  see
I've  used a cardboard tube as a cathode ray tube.  This has to be precisely
engineered,  and Clive used one of his other inventions - a ZX Spectrum - to
do  the  necessary calculations.  Unfortunately,  it wasn't  quite  accurate
enough,   and  he  cast a Spectrum on this wall when the  cathode  ray  tube
caused his flat screen to explode.  Hopefully I'll have better luck...  here
we  go.   I'm going to stand back behind this screen just in case  something
nasty happens and...  ha! It works! Well, it doesn't quite work, because you
can  see  on  this  part of the screen the colours have separated  slightly,
producing a slightly blurred image.  Clive's original screen,  designed  for
his  portable Pandora computer - which I have here - is much better quality.
Now,  I have to be very careful here, because only three of these were made,
so I don't want to break it.  But this same design was also used in his Z88,
and  in  the  Psion  palmtops.  So now I thank that brilliant  entrepreneur,
Clive Sinclair, for allowing us to word process on the move.

Don't forget to send of for your Local Heroes pack (nearly falls off bike) -
It's very good value! I'll give you the address at the end of the show.

Sorry, that's all the heroes for this week! See you next time!

If  you  want  to  recreate great inventions shown in this series  of  Local
Heroes,  then send off for your Local Heroes kit.  We don't make any  money,
so it's only £9.95.  Oh, and it also contains some gunpowder so you can blow
yourself up like I did in my 'Exploding Heroes' special.

As well as making flat screen tellies,  Adam Hart-Davis has made modern Blue
Peter-style imitations of many other things,  including the first  ever  fax
machine (transmitting a picture from London to Birmingham - well,  one  side
of a room to about three metres away),  one of Thomas Telford's roads, hand-
operated windscreen wipers for his bicycle (which,  surprisingly, he managed
to  operate while cycling and didn't fall off.  At least,  not on  the  23rd
take.)   and an excellent use for old Hank Marvin CDs - an engine which  can
run  on the slightest bit of heat (made out of a CD,  an elastic band and  a
few  other  things,  and powered by his lunch).  But most of the  time  they
don't quite work properly.

@{b}Clive,  tell me,  let's go back to the beginning. Erm, I read that quite

@{">" system "$SamplePlayer Samples/Interview/YesIWaas"} @{ub}Yes I waaaas

@{b}And did you sort of pull them apart and put them back together again  or
what?

@{">" system "$SamplePlayer Samples/Interview/PullApart"} @{ub}Well, certainly the pulling apart bit, anyway (laughs)

@{b}And, er, y- why- where did you start inventing?

@{">" system "$SamplePlayer Samples/Interview/WeveLost"} @{ub}Well,   at  school.   Erm,  I was always  intrigued  by  y-  you  know,
calculators and,  er,  mechanical calculators in those days,  and I used to,
erm,  design and sometimes make those. And, erm, I got all sorts of things I
got  interested in,  one stage it was a one man submarine that I started  to
build at the school I was at,  but,  fortunately I left the school before  I
could complete it.

@{b}Yes, if you would just-

@{ub}Touch- touch dangerous (laughs)

@{b}Yes,  we've lost Sinclair,  he's gone down.  Heh heh, heh heh. Erm, were
you a very studious schoolboy,  I mean, the sort of chap who sat at the back
very quiet...

@{">" system "$SamplePlayer Samples/Interview/Naughty"} @{ub} No.   I started off by being fairly studious,  then c- um,  did well  in  my
exams.  In fact,  I think I always did pretty well in exams.  But I-  I  was
anything but,  erm,  sort of,  well behaved,  er, schoolboy. I was always in
trouble for one thing or another-

@{b}Really...

@{ub}Generally, it was wanting to do, go my own way rather than the way-

@{">" system "$SamplePlayer Samples/Interview/YesYes"} @{ub}Yes, er, yes, yes, that's right.

@{b}This chap trying to build a submarine at school? (laughs)

@{">" system "$SamplePlayer Samples/Interview/Parents"} @{ub}Well,   my father was,  who was also,  erm,  an engineer,  and,  sort-  erm,
sometimes inventor,  he was,  erm, very encouraging, erm, my mother is, erm,
was not so, um, interested in that side of, of life.

@{b}Hmm.  But how old were you when you actually decided,  "Right, I'm going
to be an inventor. That's it."?

@{ub}Well,   there used to be a programme on the radio called @{I}Larry  the
Lamb@{ui}, and-

@{b}Oh, Toytown-

@{ub}Toytown.

@{b}Baa, Mr Gregor.  (laughs)

@{ub}Yes,   that's exactly it.  I used to listen to  that  when  I  was,   I
suppose,   about six or seven,  and there was an inventor on  that,   and  I
thought...

@{b}That's right, yes.

@{ub}That sounded a brilliant thing to be.

@{b}Mr Inventor,  yes,  yes (laughs). Well, that's a wonderful thing, and, I
mean, you left school and went into, er, I think-

@{ub}Technical journalism

@{b}Technical journalism, yes.

@{ub}I  didn't want to go to university,  because I wanted to get  out  into
the world and get on with things-

@{b}Th-  youw- That's interesting.  Wha- what- do you think  that  might  of
sort of spoilt your outlook, too much formal training?

@{ub}Erm,  well,  I'd been very bored at school the last few years, erm, and
I wanted,  to get on and,  I like to teach myself, bu- b- but I find b- that
easier  and  much faster,  and,  er,  so I wanted to get out  and  start  in
business as soon as possible, w-

@{b}Yes.

@{ub}Because  I knew that if I wanted to invent things I'd  have  to  do  it
myself, and, wasn't likely to find someone else t- to take on the invention.

@{b}And the first great success was what?

@{">" system "$SamplePlayer >NIL: Samples/Interview/Sucs.WAV"}@{ub}Well,  certainly not great in any real sense,  but what I started off  doing
was,   erm,  kits for electronics amateurs,  which was quite a big hobby  in

@{b}Um.

@{ub}Yes.  Little amplifier kits and little radio kits.  And they,  I'm glad
to say, went very well, and I sold them by mail order.

@{b}Yes.  let's go onto your next choice of music. It's Whistlin' Rick's and
it's his "Hold My Hand (Very Tightly)", no less. Why do you like that?

Uncle  Clive's C5 was sadly doomed to failure.  It was a shame really  -  it
was  designed to be part of a one-man submarine that Clive had made for  his
own  personal  use  for James Bond-style underwater  chases.   When  it  was
released  as  a  road  vehicle Ford began quaking in  their  boots  as  they
honestly believed it was the end of petrol-powered transport.  They saw  the
C5  as  the way forward for civilisation and started working on a top-secret
clone  codenamed the C6.  YS said that in the future we would all  be  using
C15s to move house (in about the year 2012)

Uncle Clive recently invested a lot of cash into Channel 5 Television.  Why?
Well  if Channel 5 got the contract for Channel 5,  then Channel 5 would  be
commonly  abbreviated to C5 - a cunning advert for the  C5.   Everyone  will
talk  about  C5 as if its good,  and the small percentage of the  population
who can't receive C5,  will buy a C5 due to completely misunderstanding what
everybody is talking about. Clever, huh?

Incidentally,  a recent survey conducted by some poor chap on a  rainy  (and
also rather cold)  day outside MacDonalds, showed these five shows to be the

"Let's have a round of applause for our contestants/four to follow!
Now,  take a look at this picture.  It's a whale/Andy the Cab driver/My  mum

What job does Andy's dad do,  a deep-sea diver or a lorry driver?/What am  I

(Cue  several  minutes of contestants deliberating  on  how  to  answer  the
ultimately pointless question.  When they finally answer,  incorrectly,  Tim
Vine, the host, inevitably takes the piss out of them via a funny 'joke'...)
"Do you actually know who Tim Vine is, Judy/Brian/John/Dave/Alan?"
(The  confused contestant replies with a resounding "No/I pressed the  wrong

"Ha Ha! Tim Vine is me, your host, Tim Vine! Remember?"
(His piss take is followed by a joke related to the question,  such as  this

"I worked as a deep-sea driver once.  But the car filled with water!  Ha Ha!
No,   that's not the joke.  I meant to say that I worked as a deep-sea DIVER

(The  following  question is going to be so impossibly  difficult  that  the

much do you think this house is worth? You've got 15 seconds,  don't tell me
until the time is up......Now, what is your answer?"
(The  bemused  contestant  was   so   miffed   by  the  question  that  they
automatically  get  it wrong,  and if that's not the case  the  question  is
fixed so they do get it wrong.)
"Ah,   well,  bad luck/nearly/better luck next time.  Lets have a  round  of

(Cue applause)
"Let's  see  how many of you got that right......13 of you,   giving  you  a

(Gestures to man in front row of audience)
"So, Stefan, what are you going to do with your £19 ?"
(The  embarassed  audience  member  mutters  something  that  no  one  hears
properly,   or cares about,  except our host,  Tim Vine.  He  probably  says
something about going down the pub.)
"You  can  buy a lot of drinks with that!  That's all for tonight/today/this

Actually,   nothing to do with what's on Channel 5 today (but  I  suppose  5
could  show 'pages from Spectacle' in a similar way to how Channel  4  shows
'pages from 4-Tel'). The Spectacle story begun a long (long) time ago:
Design  Design  used  to  put strange comments in  their  games  code  about
cheesecakes and drinking coke and stuff,  but no-one appeared to read  them.
So, they wrote a little teletext-style program called 'Spectacle', password-
protected  it and slapped it on the Dark Star tape.  It basically  consisted
of  strange articles and things written by Design-Design,  similar  to  what
was in their game's code.  In fact,  part of Spectacle was talking about the
comments they put in the code for 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'.  It  was
an  instant success,  so,  in late 1985,  they released a sequel as a  bonus
program  on the Forbidden Planet tape.  This was called,  cunningly  enough,
Spectacle_2.  It was more of the same,  only different.  They decided not to
slag  off magazines such as C+VG (although they only referred to  C+UG  -  a
'fictitious' mag called Complete + Utter Garbage)  and CRASH (although CRASH
did  give  at least a couple of their games a rating in the late  80%s).   A
selection  of  strange pages is given after clicking on  the  imaginatively-
titled "Pages from Spectacle" link.

Duncan MacDonald was not the only Spectrum-magazine-writer-who-wrote-a-game-
once-and-promptly-got-it-featured-on-the-cover.  Simon N  Goodwin  (must  be
something about the letter 'N'),  Crash's Tech Tips bloke,  also  did  this.
(unfortunately  the game was released commercially in  a  cut-down  version,
and  not  featured on the cover of the same magazine.  It did  appear  twice
though,   first on Sinclair User - which he didn't write for  -  and,   more
recently,   as an emulator snapshot on Amiga Format - which  he  does  write
for.  Instant fame.)  He wrote some game called "Gold Mine", way back almost
before  Channel 4 started.  This involved mining a gold mine for  (surprise)
gold.  And there were rock falls and stuff as well.  It took him 10 days  to
write,   almost  entirely in BASIC (the exception was  the  copy  protection
routine  - so good it even fooled the tape duplicators).  The graphics  were
designed during a particulary dull "Complementary Studies" lecture.
It  was so good it sold 3,000 copies in the first couple of weeks.  Who said
you  need a few monthsm quite a lot of people and loads of bottles  of  coke
to  write a good game? (I think it might have been Design-Design,  who later
opted  for  writing crap games in a few weeks,  becuase there was  a  higher
probability of someone wanting at least one of them.)

YS2 was (as far as I can work out)  a series of programs featured on the  YS
covertape  during  1993.   It looked identical to  teletext/Spectacle,   and
contained strange wibble written by the YS team.  Strangely,  a page in  YS2
has  an  interview  with Simon Brattel (who,  if  the  interview  is  to  be
believed,   was currently writing for YS).  Simon was part of Design-Design,
and therefore wrote some stuff for Spectacle - a coincidence? We think not.
Using a Sceptical driver they stole from Delta-4,  YS2 contained articles on
how  to  make your own student band,  a competition to win Stuart Campbells'
"Radioactive Popcorn",  Ten Ways To Kill Yourself With A Parsnip,  Ten  Ways
To  Kill  Yourself In Which A Parsnip Is Incidentally Involved  (apparently,
these parsnip things were written by none other than Leigh Loveday!),   and,
of  course,  Eric Idle's alternative theme for One Foot In The  Grave,   the
lyrics of which are reproduced here for your enjoyment:
@{hr}
Yes, I'm here today to tell you,
How to earn a quick bob or two,
Just write a theme tune for BBC,
You think it's hard? No! Listen to me;

I've written songs since '71,
Writing songs is my kind of fun,
Using chords you've all heard before,
But I still sit down and write more.

They say it's boring
ignoring musical trends,
I'm driving sane people
straight round the bend,
They say it's drivel, it's rubbish,
and what's more they claim,
It all sounds the same.

You see I write my music in C,
I go to A through B-flat and B,
Then I repeat it time after time,
Adding words to make the thing rhyme.

So now you see how easy it is,
For people in the song writing biz,
But still the last two lines of this verse,
Have given me a reason to curse.

It's my consistent persistence
I have to admit,
That's making my music sound crap a bit,
I'd do something else, but Idle's my name,
It all sounds the same,
It all sounds the same,
It all sounds the same...

One day,  a long long time ago (well,  not that long ago),  I was trying  to
watch  a  video.  Unfortunately,  at the same time,  Channel 5  were  'fine-
tuning'  their  transmission   frequency  -  from  Ch  37H  to  Ch  32H  (or
thereabouts).   They  had suddenly realised that the  old  frequency  didn't
actually  interfere with anybody's VCR,  so had to change the  frequency  to
make  sure it did (thus making the retuning programme worthwhile).  Needless
to  say,   instead  of Wallace & Gromit,  I got the lovely  "static  static"
pictured  above  right.   Because  this was  rather  unusual  (static  isn't
normally  static,  you see),  I concluded that Channel 5 and the video  must
have cancelled each other out,  and left that image on the screen.  I stared

On  the  left  you can see Whistlin' Rick a-minglin' with the  stars.   Yes,
recently he was invited to Nigel Mansell's house for a bit of a do,  and  he
got to meet such celebrities as Rolf Harris,  Bob Monkhouse, and, of course,
Su  Pollard.   He also got to hang out with musical maestros  such  as  Rick
Astley and Carol Decker from T'pau.  The evening ended with Nige letting off
a  few  fireworks from his expensive garden,  the patio  of  which  he  laid
himself. It took three weeks with no help whatsoever.

@{hr}@{b}@{i}Pavlova Recipe@{ub}@{ui}
Ingredients:
4 Egg whites
1 Cup of fine white sugar
2 Teaspoons of vinegar
1 Tablespoon of cornflour
1 Teaspoon of vanilla essence
1 Carton of whipping cream
Passionfruit, strawberries or bananas (real great big ones), sliced
a little cornflour and icing sugar for dusting

Method:
Grease an oven tray & dust with icing sugar & cornflour.  (1)  Beat the  egg
whites  until  very  stiff,  then slowly add the sugar,  beating  until  the
mixture  is even stiffer.  (2)  Fold in the cornflour,  vinegar and  vanilla
essence and pile light on the tray to about 20cms across.  Bake  in  a  slow
oven 1-1½ hours until firm.  Do not allow to colour on top.  (3)  When it is
cool,   spread  with the cream and passion fruit and either strawberries  or
bananas. Serves 6-8.

Yes,   that's right.  Davey's song was once played on Radio 1.  Someone  had
phoned  Phillip  Schofield's show and requested "Hold My Hand  Very  Tightly
(Very  Tightly)".  The song was subsequently played,  and Phillip even  sang
along at the end - "Hold my hand very tightly,  very tightly,  very tightly.
Hold  my hand very tightly oooooooooo.".  Whistlin' Rick threatened to  sue,
and Duncan's sister helpfully recorded the last five seconds.
Now,   Rick's song has another chance of being played on Radio 1 - on  Simon
Mayo's Missionary Position.  So write in and convice him that "Hold My  Hand
Very Tightly (Very Tightly)" really is the best song ever.

16 February 1997

Simon,

I'd like to nominate The Hicksons for The Missionary Position.

When  I was growing up as a teenager in Norfolk,  about 15 or so years  ago,
The  Hicksons  were the greatest thing I'd ever heard.  I  think  they  were
somehow  associated  with  the University of East  Anglia,   and  they  were
heavily  hyped  by Andy's Records in Norwich,  the only decent  record  shop
within 100 miles of my house.

They  played  in  local pubs and at the university and their  musical  flaws
were always overshadowed by the sheer energy and fun that they brought  with
them.   Great songs like "I don't wanna live with monkeys" and  "Where  have
all the club go-gos went-went?",  kept me and my mates jabbering like madmen
as we moved from pub to pub in Great Yarmouth on cold winter friday nights.

The  Hicksons  were  fun,  they were funky,  they were  usually  a  load  of
rubbish,   but most of all,  they were ours.  And in 1983 something  amazing
happened:  The Hicksons discovered girls. Up until this point the vocals had
been  delivered by a character known only as 'Switch'.  He  tried  hard  and
sometimes even carried it off.  But in 1983,  The Hicksons released a single
called  "Run  Me Down".  Fantastic backing vocals by Tessa Niles  and  Wendy
Billingsly,  meant this song was destined to be a hit.  "Look  out  for  The
Hicksons!" I told everybody,  "I bet they're gonna go far!" And they did  go
far.   I  don't know where they ended up,  Simon,  but please enlighten  the
country,  even at this late stage, to that masterpiece of Norfolk funk, "Run
Me Down".

Yours,

Simon MacDonald

Leigh  Loveday  must surely be one of the most strange  people  to  send  in

bookend that came to life on TV's Bagpuss.  Was his name Professor Yackle or
was  it  Professor Yaffle? The truth is,  it seemed,  that it  was  actually
Professor  Yapple.  Other weird letters ranged from the one-liner  Who  buys
Big  Fun  singles? to a Star-Letter winning piece of doggerel on the subject
of  the  Post Office's new time travel mailing system whereby you  can  send
letters  through time.  One classic item from the realms of the Small  Print
section,  begging Terry Venables not to sell out to Alan Sugar. "Cor Blimey,
Mr Venables,  Guv'nor",  the letter said.  "Don't go sellin' out to Amstrad,
or we'll 'ave that bleedin' Gazza all over the Speccy."

Stuart  N  Hardy never wrote into YS.  He "borrowed" his mate's  copy,   and
noticed  that a certain Leigh Loveday managed to get a letter into  (almost)
every issue.  Not one to refuse to take a challeenge,  he decided to try and
compete  for  letter-writing  space   in  none  other  than  one  of  Future
Publishing's other magazines:  Amiga Power. After writing in every month for
a  year  (and writing such obvious junk,  as well),  he extended his  talent
into other areas of Future Publishing's computer mags.  Amiga Format put  an
unofficial ban on his letters,  and Teletext's Digitiser awarded him a  'Hot
Topic' (Future Publishing subscription to Edge magazine) prize in late 1995.
Every  magazine  editor  in  the  country can  recognise  Stuart  N  Hardy's
handwriting  before reaching his signature at the bottom.  A  challenge  for
You Bet!? After the subscription ran out,  he couldn't bring himself to  buy
another magazine, so, instead, wrote into BBC TV's Points of View.
Leigh  Loveday  is now virtually unknown,  and Stuart N is regarded  as  the
most prolific letter writers in the country.  He has achieved his goal - and
then some!
Oh,   and  last night in fact he wrote into what must have been both  Ceefax
and Teletext on ITV over the course of the same weekend,  having exactly the
same  letter 'published'.  He was basically writing about how he was fed  up
that people were slagging off C5 and he said that they shouldn't because  it
hadn't  had  time  to  establish itself as a decent  channel  and  that  the
greater  choice would only be GOOD for the viewers and not bad like everyone
else thought, so there.
@{hr}
N.B.  Stu N also recently wrote into Digitiser Again, no doubt trying to win
a  'prescription' to Edge magazine by writing in with rubbish comments about
that week's hot topic which was whether computer games were confined to  sad
adolescents but Stu,  the wise man that he is,  said (and I quote)   ,"Games
are  probably  also enjoyed by Executives after a hard day at  the  office!"
(Or  something like that but yes,  the exclamation mark was there.  It seems
to us that the only sad adolescent is Stu himself.)
N.B Again :  Stu appeared on digitiser again over the weekend,  talking some
rubbish  about people would argue that their console is better because  it's
theirs  or  somesuch  useless drivel (a bit relevant  to  this  application,
really).   Digitiser replied that his first sentence was  'seriously  messed

Your  Sinclair  started  life in January 1984 by a little-known  Californian
company (well London,  actually)  called Dennis Publishing. The magazine was
then called Your Spectrum, and was only bought by sad ZX80, ZX81 and rubber-
keyed  16K  Spectrum  owners.  Eventually though,  after  the  dawn  of  the
Sinclair  QL (or maybe just before),  it changed its name to Your  Sinclair.
Even  though the QL was good,  no-one bought it.  In fact,  the only  people
buying YS were Spectrum owners,  so there wasn't much point in changing  its
name,  really.  Or something.  Later, when the Spectrum had many clones (two
at the last count - namely the SAM Coupé and the Hobbit),  YS was bought  by
many  -  including the Queen (!)  and PC/Atari/Amiga/Amstrad/BBC owners.   A
recent  survey showed that 80% of YS readers didn't actually own a  Spectrum
at all.

varied in quality,  depending on whether Whistlin' Rick was singin' on  them
or not,  to free badges of which there were 5 to collect.  Sadly, you needed
to buy 5 issues of the mag to be able to collect all 5.  The badges featured
the  hottest speccy games of the day,  mainly Back to the Future 3,  Robocop
2,  Ghostbusters 2,  and one other, ALS probably, as well as an exclusive YS
Spec-Chum badge.  Earlier freebies included a badge to celebrate Sir Clive's

Auntie  Madge hosted the YS merchandise 'problem page'.  This  consisted  of
some letters from 'Uncool';

Dear Auntie Madge,
I'm  embarassed  to  take my alligator skin wallet out  because  my  friends
laugh at me. What can I do?
Uncool, Hemel Hempstead.

The reply, as always, tended to be a bit promotional...

Dear Uncool,
I  suggest  you buy a stylish Your Sinclair wallet.  Bearing  the  YS  logo,
these  are the ultimate fashion accessory.  Soon all your friends will  want
one! And they're only @{b}£3.99@{ub}.
Auntie Madge.

Auntie  Madge  also  tried to flog YS T-Shirts to the  unsuspecting  public.
However,   she didn't have much luck,  and they were soon given  away  in  a

As  you  will find out elsewhere in this application,  David Wilson wrote  a
song.  In fact, the majority of YS contained nothing to do with Spectrums at
all  (Psst!  - supposedly the news pages - was the main culprit).  In  Psst!
they  explained  how YS was taken over by Future Publishing.   Alledgedelly,
the  boss  of  Future  was  trying   to   buy  a  second-hand  Sinclair  C5.
Miraculously,   he  accidently   called   Dennis  Publishing  instead.   The
conversation went like this:
"Hello, I'd like to buy your Sinclair"
"Certainly, that'll be £30,000, please."
"£30,000? That's rather a lot for an electric tricycle!"
"I'd  hardly describe it as that.  OK,  you have it for 380 quid,  and we'll
even throw in the editor."
"Would it be possible to deliver it?"
"Yes, but it'll cost you an extra fiver"
So  Future's  boss  thought he had just bought a  cheap  C5,   including  an
Editor,  whatever that was.  When the YS team turned up on the doorstep,  he
had nowhere for them, so set up a shed in the back garden - the YS Shed.
In  later  issues,   when  there were only two Speccy  owners  left  in  the
country,  Linda Barker (YS Tipshop Extrodinaire - after Snouty left)  set up
a Haylp! problem page for personal problems.
YS  brought  about  the  fame  of  many new and  strange  words,   including
"Cripes",   "Lummocks",   "F'nnaarrr" (the  spelling  of  F'narrrrr  varied,
depending  on  absolutely nothing at all),  "Oo-er",   "Yikes"  and  "Blimey
O'Reilly O'Rourke".
YS  also  achieved  fame itself,  as it was featured in  a  tie-in  reader's
competition with ITV's Ghost Train programme.  Art Ed Catherine  P  appeared
to  announce  who  had  won  the "Design-the-front-cover-of-next-month's-YS"
competition.

Dear Madam Pico
Help!  I'm stuck up a tree.  I'll tell you quickly what happened. I was with
some  friends,  tree climbing,  when one of them spotted this gigantic  elm.
"We'd  better not risk going up that one," he said.  "Some of  the  branches
are a bit rotten - and it must be at least 200 feet high." Not being one  to
be  outdone by a 'wood-plant',  I said my goodbyes as my chums went home for
tea  and then started my lone assault.  Things went well.  It took about  an
hour,   but I reached the top.  Trouble is that I'm now in such  a  position
that  I can't look down and therefore can't find my footing for the descent.
I've  scribbled this (with the trusty Bic ballpoint I always  carry)   on  a
piece of bark and I'm going to drop it to the ground.  I hope someone  finds
it  and sends it to you as you're the only person who might be able to help.
Please hurry, the branch I'm holding just made a creaking noise!

You  are  in  a fix aren't you dear? I'm trying to think back to  my  'tree-
climbing'  days to see if there are any hints or tips which  will  serve  to
illuminate  you on how to extricate yourself from your present  predicament.
Lummee,  the old memory isn't what it used to be,  you know. Um. Oh, I know.
Break off the nearest longish branch (about 6 feet should do)  and swish  it
about  underneath you.  Eventually it'll make contact with some protuberance
or  other,  which you should menatlly 'map' .  Discard your stick  and  then
leapfor where you think the protuberance is.  If you're lucky, you'll either
land on it or it will snag on your jumper (you are wearing a jumper,  I hope
-  it's an essential piece of tree climbing 'kit' after all).  This will  be
the  first leg of your journey terra firma - just repeat the process  30  or
40 times and you'll have made it. Good Luck.

reviewing (ish)  them.  Most were,  of course,  slightly edited versions  of
Dunc's Advanced Lawnmower Simulator.  And the rest were created with 3D Game
Maker.   One  notable exception,  however,  was Mega-Software  Microcomputer
Super-Products  Incorporated's Morning After  Simulator.   To  try  it  out,
double-click  on  the icon above right.  For the alka-seltzer,   press  'L'.
Alternatively, stare at the @{"Channel 5" link Ch5} page.

Once,  Rich was sent a game in a Jiffy bag with some,  erm,  "hair" with it.
Not  from the head,  however.  I think the game was rated 1° (with 99°  crap
factor).

Rich  now  works for PC Format magazine,  and once reviewed Star Trek:   The
Next  Generation.  He gave it about 50%,  on the grounds of not liking  Star
Trek. And loads of people wrote in and slagged him off, of course.

YOUR SINCLAIR SMASH TAPE No 32

@{"YS CAPERS" system "$SpeccyEm Progs/YSCapers.sna"}

A brand new shoot-'em-up written specially for YS by Damian Scattergood.

Oh  no!  The YS team have gone crazy and are shooting out of the TV  set  at
their  readers!   Only you can stop them!  Three levels  of  Op  Wolf  style
nastiness,   with the YS team as the meanest muthas of them  all!   (It's  a
cracker!)

So,  some of the YS team - namely Matt Bielby,  Andy Ide,  David Wilson  and
Marcus Berkmann.  And even that trainspotter bloke (pictured right with Andy
and an explosion).  This game was a big hit in 1990, some would argue it was
even  better than ALS.  But long time YS reader and famous programmer (well,
famous-ish),  Damian Scattergood, thinks differently - "After playing ALS, I
started on YS Capers.  I got bored half-way through level one.  ALS is  much
better,  a master of programming achievement.  You can play it over and over
again.   Duncan MacDonald is a pro - I left him out of YS  Capers  for  this
reason."  So  the  YS  team  have their own game.  Jealous,   Sinclair  User
magazine  tried the same thing - an into-the-screen scrolling  shoot-'em-up,
where you have to kill the SU team. Hmm...
Last we heard was Sinclair User were sued for copyright violation,  and  the
YS team have recently been signed up for Monkey Island 3.  Watch this space!
(but it's not going to change, so there isn't much point.)

Bohemian Rhapsody was possibly Queen's greatest song ever.  When Mike  Myers
(Wayne)  first heard it on the radio he thought,  "What the hell is  this!?"
and so subsequently it was used in the film. You know the scene;

Wayne: What say we have a bit of Bohemian Rhapsody?
Garth: Good call!

and  Wayne and Garth bash their heads around in time to the music.   Wayne's
neck hurt for a week afterwards.

After  the  film was released,  Wayne and Garth (Dana Carvey),   received  a
letter  from  Queen  themselves.  Wayne was about to  apologise  ('I  didn't
know...' what he didn't know isn't clear,  but I bet he doesn't know exactly
how  many  copies Bohemian Rhapsody has actually sold),  but it  turned  out
that the letter actually said,  "Thank you for using our song".  He couldn't
believe  it.  Queen were well impressed with the film,  and decided  to  use
clips  from it in the Bohemian Rhapsody video.  In fact,  according to  some
bloke,   the success of Queen (or it may have just been the song,   or  even
Wayne and Garth - he only referred to 'them')  was entirely down to the film
"Wayne's World".

@{"PLAY >" system "$SamplePlayer Music/Bohemian_Rhapsody.wav"}
To see what all the fuss is about the song,  click on the play button on the
left.   Or  watch  the  Wayne's World title animation  by  clicking  on  the
playbutton with the little box above it.

Oh,   and  there's the Rolf Harris version as well - described as  "Bohemian
Rhapsody with a Wobble Board".  Try it yourself. Clicking in this frame will
activate the wobble board (or,  of course,  you can make your own as per the
instructions on the Rolf Harris page), then sing the words below:
@{"Wobble Board Sound FX" system "$SamplePlayer >nil: Samples/Wobble"}

(Best  sung  with  an Australian accent,  out of time  with  the  music  and
slightly  out of tune as well.  Using the music from a completely  different
song helps as well.)

Andy Ide was editor of YS after Matt Bielby decided to leave and start  some
more magazines (which he promptly left).  He was (and,  indeed,  still is) a
bit  of a hippy,  using his powerful position as an excuse for spending Your
Sinclair's  budget  on Joss Sticks and "Save the Rainforests"  car  stickers
(which he stuck on the front of his no-emmision electric C5).
Andy  left  YS  after about three issues of being editor to become  head  of
Greenpeace.  Since we probably won't bother to add a page for  Andy  'Hutch'
Hutchinson,  we will now tell you that his replacement was  another  Andy  -
Andy  'Hutch'.   He  was a bit of a cool kind of dude,   riding  around  the
streets of Bath on his skateboard,  and recently wrote the manual for Cannon
Fodder 2.  He was booted off of YS about four issues after starting, like he
had been off of EMF about four months before.

Jon didn't actually review any games.  None at all.  He only really appeared

didn't  juggle  with any joysticks.  And that's it really.   He  didn't  say
anything important or memorable.  He was just,  sort of, 'there'. Due to his
reluctance  to  actually  write reviews for games,   we  have  come  to  the
conclusion that Jon just spent all day playing them,  then paying  James  to
write  the  review.  He did this by making sure he was only given  the  two-
player  games to review,  then challenged other members of the  YS  team  to
beat him.  They had,  therefore,  played the game,  knew how it worked,  and
could write a fabbo review of it.

"Well,  if this is his big adventure,  I can't imagine what the rest of  his

about Atari STs and Amigas and stuff.  He then left to work on Game Zone,  a

like  for violence,  this being reflected in the 'Cartridge Family'  section
of the magazine (which was a bit like YS's joystick jugglers).  Finally,  he
left to work on PC Zone, where he still works to this day.

Last  November he entered the International Doom Tournament,  in  which  he
promptly  won  the  UK  heats  and jetted  off  to  Seattle  where  he  lost
pathetically,   due to technical difficulties (well,   the  PCs  were  using
Windows 95® and the mice didn't work properly.  Anyway, Macca didn't want to
win,  because he wanted to get a drink after round 2).  He followed this  up
with  a  successful challenge on Gamesmaster where all  he  had  to  do  was
finish  a level of Quake what had been designed by some kid.  It was  really
easy though,  even I could have done it.  Anyway Macca is still the best  at
