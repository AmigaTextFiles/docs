 @{b}The Man And The Hour [#1]@{ub} (1968)
 
 As Anthony Eden announces the forming of the Local Defence Volunteers
 (LDV), Mainwaring appoints himself commander of the Invasion Committee,
 with Wilson as his second-in-command. Volunteers are enrolled at the church
 hall. Frazer is the first, and here we encounter Wilson and Mainwaring's
 conflicting styles of command.
 
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  Get the first main in.
 
 WILSON:
 
  Oh, very well. (looking out of the office door).
  Would you mind stepping this way, please.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  Wilson, Wilson, come here, come here. I intend to mould those men out
  there into an aggressive fighting unit. I'm going to lead them, command
  them and inspire them to be ruthless killers, and I'm not going to get
  very far if you invite them to step this way, am I?
 
  Quick march is the order.
 
 WILSON:
 
  I'm very sorry, sir. Quick march.
 
 (by this time, Frazer has already entered the office)
 
 FRAZER:
 
  There's no point, I'm already here.
 
 
 Enrolment is wrapped up after Hodges makes his debut telling Mainwaring to
 clear the hall, he's got a lecture in five minutes. The first day of the
 Walmington's LDV ends up with an inspection and lecture on German tanks.
 The expected delivery of uniforms only brings LDV armbands.

 Six weeks to go before the uniforms arrive and the platoons arsenal
 comprises of a shotgun, 15 carving knives. Jones' assegai and Bracewell's
 number three iron. But when a letter arrives instructing the bank to close
 the account of the Peabody Museum of Historic Army Weapons for the
 duration, Mainwaring and Wilson have an idea. At 1800 hours Operation Gun
 Grab begins. The aim - to requisition any firearms of use in the platoon's
 fight against the Nazis.
 
 The trouble is they've got to outwit the crusty 88-year-old caretaker who
 turns out to be Jones' father. After numerous attempts Frazer, disguised as
 an ARP warden, exploits the caretaker's predilection for booze. While he's
 outside the museum swigging down whisky, the platoon seizes a Chinese
 Rocket Gun. Mainwaring, who's not particularly enthused by their new
 weapon, is forced to eat his words when the gun goes off and he ends up
 sheltering under a table.

 When the platoon fall in, Mainwaring tells Pike off for wearing a muffler
 on parade. But he's got a note from his mother.
 
 
 MAINWARING: (reading the note)
 
  "Frank is starting with his chest again, he ought to be in bed. If he
   can't wear his muffler he's to come home or he will catch his death".
 
  (turning to Wilson).
 
  We can't have him wearing that thing on parade, makes the whole platoon
  look ludicrous.
 
 WILSON:
 
  Perhaps he could wear it on patrol, sir? (turning to Pike).
  What time do you go on?
 
 PIKE:
 
  Ten till twelve, sir.
 
 WILSON:
 
  It'll be dark by then, sir, anyway.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  Oh, very well.
 
 
 The dearth of weapons causes low morale in the platoon. At the bank the
 following day a visit from an old campaigner Colonel Square, leaves
 Mainwaring in a predicament. Square wants to take over the platoon and in
 doing so will allow them the use of his 20 rifles. That evening, after much
 cogitating, Mainwaring announces that he's placing the platoon under
 Square's command. But at Marsham Hall, Square's home, Mainwaring swiftly
 reverses his decision after discovering the crackpot plans to turn them
 into cavalry with circus horses and antiquarian muskets. Back under
 Mainwaring's command their supply of guns arrive before the day's out.

 Mainwaring's lecture on dealing with enemy agents is interrupted by a
 monocle-wearing officer, with a suspicious accent. Not taking any chances,
 they arrest the man and plan an interrogation until he convinces them he's
 a Polish captain serving with GHQ - he's there simply to inform them of the
 £10 reward for every Nazi arrested. On night patrol, Jones' section
 captures two German pilots.
 
 While being held at the church hall, Godfrey credulously lets them escape.
 But the Polish captain recaptures them and escorts the pilots back to the
 hall. When military police collect the prisoners, the Polish captain is
 mistakenly arrested as well, rewarding the platoon by a total of £30.

 Major Regan visits from area HQ to monitor progress in everything from use
 of weapons to first aid. Things run smoothly until he labels Jones a
 potential danger - not only did he forget how to aim a rifle, but his
 glasses steamed up when charging the dummy with his bayonet. Jones' fate is
 decided on his ability to negotiate an assault course in 15 minutes.
 
 On the eve of the test, Jones' outlook is bleak until certain platoon
 members cook up a plan. Strategically placed along the course, they help
 the butcher romp home with two minutes to spare.

 @{b}Shooting Pains [#6]@{ub} (1968)
 
 Mainwaring and Wilson discuss the forthcoming shooting practice and the
 fiasco last time.
 
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  To tell you the truth, Wilson, I was a bit ashamed of our shooting
  last week.
 
 WILSON: (glancing away and rubbing his ear lobe)
 
  Oh, I don't know, sir, some of the men didn't do too badly.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  No, I still fail to understand how they can possibly mistake the tyres on
  the area commanders staff car for the target.
 
 WILSON:
 
  All four of them?
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  No, all five of them - they got the spare as well!
 
 
 Mainwaring's platoon, the first to be formed in the area, is selected to
 provide the guard of honour for the Prime Minister's impending visit. But
 sloppy shooting at the range forces the major to consider changing his
 views and select the Eastgate platoon instead.
 
 The matter is decided by a shooting contest in which three of Walmington's
 men compete against Eastgate.
 
 A visit to the local Hippodrome that evening sparks off one of Walker's
 devious plans. Crack shot Laura la Plaz, who entertains the Hippodrome
 audience with her firing skills, dresses up as a platoon member to help
 Walmington win the contest. But when it appears the scheme is going to
 backfire, Frazer steps up and clinches victory by scoring five bull's-eyes.

 manoeuvres. Six of his regiment will attempt to capture Mainwaring's HQ.
 
 As the Walmington boys outnumber Ogilvy's bunch by three to one, they

 spying on Ogilvy at his base at Manor Farm, the Walmington platoon are
 successful in laying man traps to capture their opponents.

 Godfrey's cottage is picked as a machine gun post in the event of an
 invasion. While Mainwaring is in the bank's vault, he doesn't hear the toll
 of the church bells signifying a German invasion. Wilson and Pike head for
 the Novelty Rock Emporium while Jones and Frazer inform Mainwaring and head
 for Godfrey's cottage, unaware where their sergeant has gone.
 
 Eventually Wilson and Pike decide to make for the cottage, which is being
 guarded by the rest of the platoon.
 
 When Jones nips off to the outside toilet, Wilson and Pike mistake him for
 a German and begin shooting. But when Godfrey's sister, oblivious to all
 the pandemonium, waves her tea cloth out of the window, Wilson and Pike
 take it as a sign of surrender and move towards the cottage, only to find
 their supposed enemies are none other than their own men.

 Walker is called up which is bad news for the platoon because of his
 deftness in acquiring essential supplies like cigarettes, booze and fudge
 for Godfrey's sister. Mainwaring decides that Walker is too important to
 the platoon to let him go, so he fights the War Office on his behalf.
 
 His valiant attempts fail and Walker joins the army. But within days he's
 discharged, much to the relief of the platoon, when it's discovered he's
 allergic to corned beef.

 Overhearing Mrs. Pike talking to Frank, Wilson gets the wrong end of the
 stick. After receiving a letter from the WVS asking her to take in a
 evacuee, she tells Pike that it will be nice being a mother again. Wilson
 hears and assumes she is pregnant. Confusion reigns and when Wilson
 eventually confides in Mainwaring, he sees no alternative, Wilson will
 have to marry her.
 
 The platoon is to provide the guard of honour at the wedding, but as Wilson
 practices the ceremonial march with Jones substituting for Mrs. Pike, Mavis
 brings little Arthur into the church hall and introduces him to Wilson.
 Confusion cleared, Wilson breathes a sign of relief.

 Mainwaring is allowed to promote someone to Corporal. He suggests that
 instead of giving the job to Jones, they should install another
 Lance-Corporal and see who performs the best. Classing himself the best
 judge of character, he picks Frazer, against Wilson's advice. The
 competition causes intense rivalry between the two candidates and much
 fawning towards Mainwaring.
 
 The men begin to dislike Frazer's brash attitudes and overpowering desire
 to impress, particularly when he presents charge sheets containing Pike's
 name for deserting his post and cowardice in the face of the enemy, and
 Walker for mutiny. After Jones is added to the list, action is required:
 Frazer quickly falls out of contention for promotion.

 GHQ orders the platoon to work closer with the ARP. The new chief warden is
 to discuss suggestions as to how this can be achieved - but who is the new
 warden, asks Mainwaring.
 
 
 WILSON:
 
  It's that rather common fellow, sir, Mr. Hodges, I think.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  You mean to say they've made him chief warden?
 
 WILSON:
 
  Yes, they have.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  He's a greengrocer!
 
 WILSON:
 
  Yes, I know that, sir, because of his dirty fingernails.
 
 
 As soon as Hodges arrives, the foundations of his friction-based
 relationship with Mainwaring are laid. Walker persuades Jones into loaning
 his delivery van, which is converted to gas for fuel economy, to the
 platoon, primarily because he wants to use it for his own black market
 dealings. The delivery van takes on a new role as an ambulance during
 Hodges' air raid practice, with the platoon becoming stretcherbearers.

 After taking four hours to reach the camp from the station, from just a

 Trouble is in the air when the platoon blow all their ammo in a nights

 superiors. The gravity of the scene is punctuated by the entrance of Mrs.
 Pike, concerned about nothing more than Frank's appearance.
 
 
 MRS. PIKE:

 PIKE:
 
  I've been shooting at aeroplanes, we think we shot one down.
 
 MRS. PIKE:

 A Court of Inquiry is held, upon Mainwaring's insistence, into the use of

 The arrival of Mr. West, the bank inspector, is all Mainwaring needs. When
 he points out that the monthly report to head office has become irregular,
 Mainwaring blames the weight of responsibility, particularly as he's
 protecting the stretch of coastline from Stone's Amusement Arcade to the
 Novelty Rock Emporium. An air raid interrupts the discussion, and they
 return to find the bank has taken a direct hit. Both Mainwaring and Wilson
 fall down a gaping hole in the office and end up clutching an unexploded
 bomb in the banks strongroom.
 
 
 WILSON:
 
  Sir, if you could possibly lower your end just a little bit.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  Don't do that, the slightest movement could set this thing off.

  Well we can't sit here all day holding it like this, sir, for heavens

 Mainwaring decides the platoon needs a mascot, particularly as on Sunday
 morning they will be leading the big parade to mark the start of Spitfire
 Week. Private Sponge donates a ram - if anyone can catch one at his farm.
 Wilson gets caught on barbed wire and Pikey falls in a bog. After several
 failed attempts, the boy is finally rescued. The parade takes place without
 the mascot, even though Walker offered a goat as an alternative.

 Mainwaring introduces the three F's - fast feet, functional feet and fit
 feet. After inspecting the mens feet he announces a series of route
 marches. After a seven mile trek he plans to inspect their feet again, but
 takes Wilson into the office to check his in private to save embarrassment.
 
 
 WILSON:
 
  Yes, quite, in that case who's going to inspect your feet, sir?
 
 MAINWARING: (rubbing his chin)
 
  Yes, I see your point. Look here. (he moves closer to Wilson).
  You show me yours and I'll show you mine.
 
 
 The platoon feel Mainwaring is getting obsessed by his drive for healthy
 feet, particularly when he organises a barefoot football match, running
 across the pebbled beach and marching in the sea. But when he announces the
 20-mile route march, that's the final straw. The platoon plan swapping
 Mainwaring's boots with a smaller pair in an attempt to make his feet hurt
 and prevent him completing the march. But they hadn't accounted for the
 shopkeeper returning another pair of Mainwaring's boots from repair just in
 time for the march.

 As Pikey can't swim and the tide is rushing in, there's no alternative but

 Mainwaring sets up an observation post in a lighthouse and Jones' section

 As the lighthouse has its own generator, it's vital that Mainwaring gets a

 to get the line reconnected via the exchange are fruitless until Walker
 takes control.

 the butchers war record, claiming Jones left him in the desert to die. The
 morning post brings Jones three anonymous letters and the stark message
 that there's no room in Walmington for a coward.
 
 It's time for action. After Clarke recalls his version of events to

 Clarke were captured in the desert but that he overcame one of the captors
 and rescued Clarke who'd been pegged down in the blazing heat to die.

 A bomb hits the pumping station where Walker and Godfrey are on patrol.
 Mainwaring and the rest of the platoon rush to help but the door is
 blocked. Eventually the rubble is removed and Mainwaring and his men are
 able to enter the room and free Walker and Godfrey. A further fall of
 debris traps them all, and when the water pipe bursts and the room rapidly
 fills with water, time is running out for the intrepid soldiers.
 
 Just as the water nears neck level, Godfrey notices a manhole cover and the
 platoon flee in the nick of time. But their problems aren't over yet.

 Believing the Home Guard is full of old warhorses and the ARP of younger,
 fitter personnel, Parliament agrees an exchange of men. A parade is
 planned during which an official from Area HQ will select those to be
 transferred. With the ageing Walmington-on-Sea platoon likely to be hit
 hard, everyone makes an effort to look younger. Mainwaring buys a toupee
 and Wilson wears a corset.
 
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  Wilson, you're wearing corsets, am I right?
 
 WILSON:
 
  It's a gentlemans abdominal support.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  Gentlemans abdominal support, my fool, it's corsets. You're a rum cove.
  You wear that uniform like a sack of porridge and you're as vain as a
  peacock.
 
 WILSON:
 
  It's nothing to do with vanity, sir, I just don't want to be drafted into
  Hodges' mob, that's all, I'm really rather proud of this platoon. I think
  you've done wonders getting us all together the way you have - I really
  mean that. So I just think it pays at the moment not to look any older
  than one needs.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  I'm sorry, Wilson.
 
 WILSON:
 
  That's alright.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  It's very kind of you to pay that tribute to me, very kind. I realise it
  doesn't come easy to a cold fish like you. And here I am pouring scorn on
  you. I had no right to really, no right at all. I have to tell you,
  Wilson, that I too have taken some steps to look a little more...
  a little  more virile.
 
 WILSON:
 
  Oh my god, it's not monkey glands, is it?
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  No! It's nothing as drastic as that. What do you think of this?
  (he carefully removes his hat and reveals a ragged wig).
 
 WILSON:
 
  It's awful! (he begins laughing). No, no, no, awfully good, it's awfully
  good. (he subsides into unbridled laughter).
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  Watch it, Wilson, you might snap your girdle!
 
 
 The platoon are also worried they'll be transferred, particularly Godfrey,
 Jones and Frazer, who decide to take drastic action with their appearance.

 Wilson is missing and Godfrey reports seeing him with his arm round an
 attractive blond. Walker, meanwhile, promises to supply Jones with several
 dozen pigeons to help his meat supply.
 
 As Mainwaring tells the men about the voluntary church parade on Sunday,
 which he expects everyone to attend, a groaning from the stage turns out to
 be an inebriated Sergeant Wilson.
 
 Walker and Jones work into the night trying to hide the pigeons away, but
 Hodges spots the small paraffin light.
 
 
 HODGES:
 
  Oi! Put that ruddy light out, haven't you heard the Jerry planes flying
  over?
 
 JONES:
 
  Well, they can't see a little light like that.
 
 HODGES:
 
  How do you know? Have you been up there to have a look? I'm going to book
  you for this.
 
 JONES:

 WALKER: (passing a couple of pigeons to Hodges)
 
  Come 'ere, have a couple of pigeons and forget it.
 
 HODGES:

  Ta, thanks very much.
 
 
 When news reports state a mysterious loss of pigeons from Trafalgar

 task is to occupy a deserted barn and defend it against the enemy. But
 Godfrey and Jones mix up the map references and Mainwaring takes up
 position in the barn being used as the target for the 25 pounders.
 
 Jones and Godfrey, who occupy HQ, desperately try phoning to stop the

 Mainwaring is giving a slide show and Frazer isn't happy because it's
 lovely summers evening. After the lecture, he bursts into the office and
 accuses Mainwaring of wasting time on irrelevant lectures. Mainwaring is
 furious and fed up with his grousing, so decides to swap rank with Frazer
 for a few days.
 
 The power soon goes to Frazer's head, as Wilson discovers.
 
 
 FRAZER: (checking a discrepancy in a record sheet)
 
  You cannot wriggle your way out of this with me, there's a discrepancy,
  eight yards of four by two missing and unaccounted for.
 
 WILSON:
 
  Well I think if you look at the overall...

  S-t-a-n-d to attention when your addressing an officer.

  Well I-I-I might have given a little extra to some of the chaps.
 
 FRAZER:
 
  Precisely, incompetence and extravagance - maybe even corruption. Well
  that's it, you're busted!
 
 
 The whole platoon gets shaken up except for Pikey and Walker who are
 promoted to rank of corporal and sergeant respectively. The new Major
 General, who's taken over area command, arrives at the church hall office
 and discusses progress with Frazer. He invites him along to the forthcoming
 Highland get-together and asks him to play the bagpipes.
 
 Eventually Mainwaring slips back into his former role of captain. But what
 he doesn't realise is that the invitation to attend the Highland dinner
 involves playing the bagpipes, which, to Frazer's surprise, he does with
 consummate ease.

 In an attempt to remember what he's dome with the cash, Jones even succumbs

 The Americans have joined the fight against the Germans and a darts match
 is arranged at the Red Lion to welcome a small advance party. After the
 formal introductions, Mainwaring tells the Americans to make themselves at
 home, so they rush over to the girls - who happen to be the platoon members
 partners. When the American colonel complains about the warm beer and
 Hodges mouths off about the slowness of the Yanks in joining the war, a
 fight breaks out.
 
 Thanks to Mr. Cheeseman of the Eastbourne Gazette, who was attending the
 party, extensive coverage of the incident appears in the local rag.

 With King Henry VI passing through Walmington-on-Sea on the Royal Train,
 Mainwaring's men provide the Guard of Honour. When a trains whistle is
 heard in the distance they line up before realising it's a false alarm. The
 engine stops and the drivers go to the office to make a phone call and have
 a quick cuppa. Mistaking Mainwaring's sleeping pills for saccharin they're
 quickly asleep in their chairs leaving no alternative but for the Home
 Guard to move their train in order to clear the line for the King.
 
 Pike is the only one who can drive the engine, the trouble is he can't stop
 it. After some hair-raising moments, they manage to stop just in time to
 see the King go racing by.

 The platoon compete in an efficiency test and take their Smith gun along.
 When Mainwaring opens the door of Jones' van, hundreds of onions, Walker's
 order for Hodges, fall out. If the men pass the test with flying colours,
 they'll be graded a 12-star platoon. After early set back while negotiating
 an electric fence and attacking the NAAFI teagirl, who they suspect of
 carrying a bomb in disguise, they pick up marks for showing initiative when
 firing Walker's onions at an advancing line of troops. But is it enough to
 earn them their 12-star goal.

 Mainwaring heads a committee set up to greet a celebrated Russian visiting
 Walmington. Frazer suggests giving him a £10 voucher towards funeral
 expenses, Mrs. Fox, representing the WVS, feels everyone should smile a
 lot, while Godfrey's not sympathetic to the Reds.
 
 Mainwaring takes the suggestions away to consider the best plan. At the
 bank a letter arrives addressed to The Honourable Arthur Wilson, the result
 of an uncle dying which has moved his family up the social ladder.
 Mainwaring can't believe it.
 
 
 WILSON:
 
  I don't really see why it should make any difference to you and me.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  You can bet your bottom dollar it won't make any difference to you and me.

 MAINWARING: (red in fury)
 
  I've been trying for years to get in there.
 
 WILSON:

 It seems everyone thinks the newly-titled Wilson should present the key
 allowing the visitor the freedom of the town and, although Mainwaring
 fights against it, Wilson comes out on top again.

 As a pack of dogs howls outside, the house appears empty except for the

 platoon wait nervously - but it turns out to be Captain Cadbury. In the

 the problem is they aren't fully trained and are still inclined to tear
 their victims apart.

 Mainwaring is in hospital with ingrowing toenails and his trusty old pistol
 by his side. Wilson is in charge of the platoon, who aren't happy when he
 allows they Vicar and the Verger to join the ranks.
 
 They arrive for their first parade.
 
 
 VICAR: (he runs into the office)
 
  Oh dear, I'm sorry I'm late, the confirmation class went on and on and on
  - have I missed anything?
 
 WILSON:
 
  It's perfectly alright, we're just going to start the parade now.

 Mainwaring arrives at the hall, he's discharged himself early. Unhappy with
 the new additions, he aims to remove them. That evening they're on patrol
 with Jones' section. While the Verger and Vicar are on guard an impudent
 kid gives them lip. The Verger clips him round the ear and he rushes off to
 tell his Uncle Willie - who turns out to be Hodges. Mainwaring feels the
 Vicar should have dealt with the matter better - taking offence, the new

 Jones pours out his heart to Mainwaring and Wilson - he suspects widow Mrs.
 Fox, who he'd been 'Walking out with' of being smitten with Mr. Gordon, the
 town clerk.
 
 
 WILSON:
 
  What! Not that silly bald-headed old duffer, do you mean?
 
 (Mainwaring removes his hat revealing his shining bald head)

  Oh, I don't mean he's a bald-headed old duffer because he's got a bald
  head... I mean he'd be a silly old... wouldn't he?... I mean... he'd be a
  silly old duffer even if he'd got a full head of hair.

 Jones begs Mainwaring to speak to Mrs. Fox on his behalf - he reluctantly

 stumbles his way through his words, Mrs. Fox gets the wrong end of the
 stick and thinks Mainwaring fancies her.
 
 In the church hall Hodges and his panel of judges are selecting who'll play
 Lady Godiva in the procession. After a whisper in his ear, the Town Clerk
 selects the robust Mrs. Fox. When on procession day, Mrs. Fox finds her

 Pike gets his call-up papers and has to attend a medical, but Mrs. Pike
 think it's just a formality before he's rejected because of his weak ankles
 and chest, not to mention the nervous twitch he's recently adopted. So
 she's shocked when he's passed A1. To celebrate the boy's departure, the
 platoon hold a fish and chip supper at the local chippie.
 
 But before that the town clerk organises a blood donor session and the
 rivalry between Hodges and Mainwaring leads to a contest to see who can get
 the most people to be donors. Just when it looks like Hodges will win,
 Jones and Frazer come to their captains rescue by gathering together 17
 nuns and a myriad of Italian POWs.
 
 At the chip shop the platoon enjoy their fish and chips until Pikey
 announces that his recent donation of blood has indicated that he belongs
 to a rare blood group - he can't join up.

 After devouring upside down cakes, they leave without broaching the

 Frazer champions Godfrey's cause and blackmails the minister responsible

 While testing out their new two-man bivouac tents at weekend camp, the
 platoon are disturbed by Hodges dropping off the Vicar, Verger and the Sea
 Scouts, who also intend to camp on the same site. The next morning finds
 three German airmen in an inflatable dinghy on the lake, casualties of the
 previous nights air raid.
 
 With the use of a raft, Mainwaring and some of his men, together with
 Hodges, who's acting as interpreter, consider all ways of getting the
 Germans to the shore.
 
 
 PIKE:
 
  Lets shoot at the rubber dinghy and sink it.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  We can't do that either, the bullets will go straight through and hit
  them. This is the penalty you pay for being a sporting nation and playing
  with a straight bat.
 
 WILSON:
 
  You know, it's really quite simple, sir. All we've got to do is attach a
  rope to the dinghy and tow it to the shore.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  Ah!... well done, Wilson... just wondered who'd be the first to spot that.
 
 
 After the scheme fails, it's down to Pike to resolve the problem by
 shooting his bow and arrow to sink the dinghy.

 After failing to balance the books, Mainwaring prepares to speak to Jones

 Finally it's established that the reason Jones is in the red is because the

  that. Anybody tries to take our homes or our freedom away from us, they'll
  find out what we can do. We'll fight. And we're not alone, there are
  thousands of us all over England.
 
 FRAZER:
 
  And Scotland.
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  And Scotland. All over Great Britain, in fact. Men who'll stand together
  when their country needs them.
 
 WILSON:
 
  Excuse me, sir. Don't you think it might be a nice idea if we paid our
  tribute to them?
 
 MAINWARING:
 
  For once, Wilson, I agree with you. (they raise their mugs).
  To Britain's Home Guard.
 
 ALL:
 
  To Britain's Home Guard.
