Bored during maths?  You have a Casio graphics calculator? Then what are you waiting for?  These programs will relieve boredom, and even help you with your maths work (well, that's what you tell the teachers, anyway).

These definately work on the Casio fx-7300G, but should work on other models, as well.

Please Note: I extracted this from a much larger AmigaGuide file, so if any links don't work, then that is why.
I do not and will not accept any responsibility for loss of data, bad grades or anything else incurred through direct or indirect use of any of these programs.
Yes, I know, I've done it again - this guide uses the wordwrapping functions of V39+.  Sorry.

Oh, and you might have to hunt around for a few things.
eg. => is in FUNC-PRGM-JUMP and -> is the memory-type button, <> should be the "does not equal" symbol and / is actually the little "pause-prog" triangle.
Exclamation marks are kindly provided by the x! function - thanks!

OK, you're on a short hole, which requires a club somewhere between a 1 and a 9 iron.  The choice is yours: pick the wrong club, and the ball will either fall short of the hole or go straight past.  Power is set to full, and aiming is automatic.  Will you get a hole in one or, erm, not?

You are the production manager of a new biscuit company.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it (I suggest you do, since you'll be out of job if you don't), is to make some biscuits.  But it's not that easy - the machine is broken and a 100% success rate is obtainable, but unlikely.  Can you, using your cookery skills and knowledge of where the EXE button is, produce the maximum amount of award-winning biscuits?  (The most I have seen anyone manage is 7)

Have you ever wanted to take part in the "Daz Doorstep Challenge", as seen
so many times on the TV ads?  This program will allow you to do that.

Select the variety of washing powder you normally use from the menu, and
read the result.

I hope you are successful.  I do, really.

Controls: Select washing powder with numeric keys 1-4 and ENTER

@{u}DAZ-CHAZ 2: The Ultimate (Daz Doorstep) Challenge@{uu}
@{i}Written by Chris Young (again)@{ui}
(This game requires hisoftbasic.library)

Will your whites pass the Daz Doorstep Challenge?

Just select the colour your whites are (after being washed, of course), and read whether you are successful or not.

Controls: Use left mouse button to "open door" and select colour.  The close gadget quits, of course.
On the title screen, the space bar toggles whether you are using Pre-Workbench 2.0 colours (Blue-White-Black-Orange) or Workbench 2.0 colours (Grey-Black-White-Blue).  This selects the right setting (assuming you have not changed the default palette) automatically through the Workbench environment variable.  This is normally set in the startup-sequence upon booting, but if it isn't the program will not run.
Set it from a CLI/Shell with...

SETENV WORKBENCH <workbench version number>

Where <workbench version number> is your workbench version number.  NOT THE RELEASE NUMBER.

You can find the Workbench version number by typing:

VERSION

For example, for Workbench 2.0 the number might be 37.67

@{i}Program by Chris Young 14/06/96
Idea "borrowed" from a game with the same name by Skintflintsoft (Duncan MacDonald, I reckon), and written to conform with the "How to write a beat-em-up" section in the same issue of Your Sinclair.  It also incorporates a few features from @{"ALS" link ALS}.
Lo-Score idea thrown in by Stuart Flint, who also heavily playtested it, managing to get the lowest score of 11 (lowest possible: 0) and the highest of 458 (maximum 760, average score 190).  I subsequently managed to beat it with an amazing score of 472, however.
And then I banned ANS.  Ha Ha.@{ui}

'They' laughed - "A beat-em-up on a calculator? ha ha."
But now everyone's addicted... (I think it's beating the record scores that does it)

Choose your character from a cast of thousands (well, three), and see if you can defeat the Evil Bloke.  There are a variety of moves (one), requiring lots of skill and judgement (ie. none) and even a little bit (a bit more than that, actually) of luck.

There are three parts to this, stored in memory banks 0, 1 and 2
/ is the triangle (shift-prog), and <> should be = with line through it (func-prgm-rel-2)

Controls: To run this program, RUN bank 2 on first run, then use bank 0 afterwards. If you put anything in memory H or L, then RUN bank 2 to clear it (will clear hi/lo-scores)
Use keys 1-3 and EXE to choose your character
Hit EXE repeatedly to run around and hit him

@node CasioLem "Lemming (Lemmings clone)"
@{u}Lemming@{uu}
@{i}Program by Chris Young
Based on the game of Lemmings by DMA Design/Psygnosis@{ui}

The reason for the title being singular is because there is actually only one lemming.

The object of the game (for the 0.01% who don't know), is to rescue a pre-determined amount of lemmings (in this case, one, since you only start with one) by assigning particular skils to them.

Guide the lemming into his home (the ,^, symbol) by using the following controls:

Hit EXE repeatedly to get him to walk along.  When the question mark (?) appears, you can assign the following lemming types to him:

1: Floater «FLT»   (Give the lem a brolly)                 }
2: Digger  «DIG»   (Dig vertically downwards)              } Level 1
3: Bomber  «BMB»   (5 .. 4 .. 3 .. 2 .. 1 .. Oh No! <pop>) }

1: Builder «BUILD» (Build diagonally upwards)              }
2: Blocker «BLOCK» (Stops other lemmings from passing)     }
                                                           } Level 2
1: Climber «CLIMB» (Lets your lem climb up vertical walls) }
2: Basher  «BASH»  (Dig horizontally through wall)         }

@node Bush "Bush Tucker Man"
@{u}Bush Tucker Man@{uu}
@{i}By Chris Young, inspired by the TV programme (although I must admit to not actually having seen it myself) of the same name.@{ui}

The title says it all really: you take the role of the Bush Tucker Man (who, according to Duncan MacDonald, is the only person able to make a helicoptor out of koala droppings).

This is a sort of "pre-release demo" of the @{"full" link BTMan} Bush Tucker Man game out later this week (if I can be bothered to start it - I'm writing this on a Thursday night, by the way, so that gives me about 2 days to write it.  Should be long enough.  It'll be crap anyway.  On purpose, of course.  I'll probably write it in Hisoft BASIC, which automatically makes it rubbish - well, version 1 does anyway [I don't want to slag version 2 off, having not actually used it].).  Anyway, this game involves the bit where Les crosses a river full of crocs.  All you have to do is repeatedly hit EXE to cross the river - WILL YOU SURVIVE?  OR DIE A NASTY DEATH IN THE TEETH OF A CROCODILE?

The @{"full game" link BTMan} will be a bit like "Frogger", where you have to cross a river full of crocs (instead of a busy road.  I never understood why a frog would want to cross a busy road anyway).  Instead of using logs to cross a river, you will, erm, actually, I haven't got a clue what the rest of the game will be, but it'll be good anyway (in a crap sort of way).

@node Terrace "The Terrace (with Mike Reid)"
@{u}The Terrace (with Mike Reid)@{uu}
@{i}By Chris Young 1996@{ui}

Time for a review of this piece of @{"quality TV" link Ch-TV} entertainment...

@{i}The Terrace@{ui} is a cheapskate DIY programme, where Mike Reid walks around a building site with a cup of tea (and almost spilling it), whilst introducing Roger and Simon doing some DIY.  In other words, he doesn't actually do an ounce of DIY himself - instead, he gets the builders to make some crap jokes, then makes a sarcastic comment about how funny the joke was ("Heh, heh.  Heh, heh.  That was hysterical.").

In this game you take the role of Mike Reid, and attempt to walk across a building site without spilling any of your cup of tea.
