  You'll need at least Kickstart 2.0 and AmigaGuide to see the texts.

  For the images, you will need at least kickstart 3.0 (or 2.1 I don't know),
and FastJPEG installed on an assigned directory under the name FJPEG.

@node notes "Last notes..."


  An important point to notice: all data concerning the year of 1996 have
been added by me. That means several things:
 . It's possible that I forgot something in the titles or finalists. In the
   singles, I don't think,  but it's very likely in the doubles.
 . I didn't change the career price money: it would be a work of hell, and
   anyway, I don't have the data for this.
 . I didn't change the highest singles/doubles ranking. For the doubles, it's
   simply impossible, and for the singles, I don't wanna look at every ATP
   ranking for every player. Anyway, I changed it for Muster because being
   number one is a major event. I can also tell you that Arnaud Boetsch have
   been ranked 12th this year, but I don't know when. Also changed is Michael
   Chang, ranked 2nd after the US Open 96 and Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 3rd after
   Paris-indoor.
If you find mistakes on these addings, do not hesitate to mail me them for
corrections at @{b}fgoucem@samoa.unice.fr@{ub}.

  If you count the number of titles for certain players, you'll see they
don't match to the number. The number is the one to trust. I think this is
due to the fact that Grand Slam Cup is not written in the lists except for
Ivanisevic. For instance, you will see: Pete Sampras CAREER TITLES(44),
and if you count, you will find only 43 titles. But he won the Grand Slam
Cup in 1990, and it is not written in the list. Hence, here are the results
of the Grand Slam Cup since its creation:

  1990 - Pete Sampras      defeats  ???
  1991 - David Wheaton     defeats  Michael Chang
  1992 - Michael Stich     defeats  Michael Chang
  1993 - Petr Korda        defeats  Michael Stich
  1994 - Magnus Larsson    defeats  Pete Sampras
  1995 - Goran Ivanisevic  defeats  Todd Martin
  1996 - Boris Becker      defeats  Goran Ivanisevic

@{b}1995 IN REVIEW@{ub}
The most dominating claycourt player on the ATP Tour won a career-high 12
titles in 14 finals, highighted by his first career Grand Slam title at the
French Open...His 11 claycourt titles was the most since Guillermo Vilas
won 14 clay titles in 1977 and his 12 overall titles was the most since
John McEnroe won 13 in 1984...The veteran Austrian is the first left-hander
to finish in the Top 3 since McEnroe was No. 2 in 1985...After beginning
the season with a 5-4 record, opened his claycourt dominance (65-2 record)
in Mexico City where he won for the third straight year (d. Meligeni)...
That was the start of 40 consecutive claycourt match wins (from Feb. to
June) and seven titles   Estoril (d. A. Costa), Barcelona (d. Larsson),
Mercedes Super 9 stops in Monte Carlo (d. Becker) and Rome (d. Brugeura),

match winning streak was the longest since John McEnroe won 42 in succession
in 1984...Had not lost in 24 claycourt finals going back to May 1990 before
losing to Alberto Costa in five sets in Kitzbuhel...After the defeat, went

Washington F)...Led the ATP Tour with a 12-3 record vs. Top 10 opponents...
The active career claycourt titles leader with 33...Made his second ATP Tour
