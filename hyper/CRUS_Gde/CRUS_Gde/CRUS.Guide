 @{b}War Zone [#1]@{ub} (1998)
 
 Matthew Gideon is the newly-commissioned captain of the Excalibur, a ship that
 will carry the quest to save the Earth to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.
 But he hardly has time to meet his crew before he's called to recover a downed
 Drakh vessel which just may be one of the ships that poisoned Earth.
 
 Meanwhile, Interplanetary Expeditions Max Eilerson finds himself in the wrong
 place at the wrong time, as his archaeological find of a lifetime becomes the
 stage for a battle between the Excalibur crew and a band of grounded Drakh.
