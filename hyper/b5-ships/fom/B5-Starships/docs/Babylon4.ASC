Babylon 4
*********
Babylon 4 was the largest of the stations, built as part of the
Babylon Project by the Earth Alliance after the Earth/Minbari War.
Built on a tremendous budget, it was completed in 2254. 24 hours 
after becoming operational, however, it disappeared.

Addendum
There is a leaked report that Babylon 4 reappeared at its 
original location in Sector 14 in 2258, 4 years after its 
disappearance. The crew on board were recovered, and then 
it disappeared later again. Sector 14 has since been declared 
off-limits.

Rumors persist that Babylon 4 disappeared into a time-space 
rift, and is being pulled into the future by an unknown 
entity known as "The One" for use in a great war.
