2.1 Basil

Latin name: Ocimum basilicum, other Ocimum species.
=====
2.1.1 Growing basil
-----
From: engels@wibla.mv.att.com (engels s.m.):
Basil loves the sun and hates the cold & wind. If it drops below 50 degrees
at night, the leaves will yellow. When it warms up the new growth will be
green. If it doesn't get enough sun and stays in damp soil too long, it
will eventually die. The wind will bruise the leaves. So will rough
handling. Again, the new growth will be fine.

Very important to harden basil plants. Transplant shock may kill them. Set
the pots outside for 3-5 days (watch the night temps) before transplanting.

I use compost and occasionally organic fertilizer. Never had any bug
problems. A few caterpillars and rabbits, but there was plenty for everyone
in my patch.

-----
From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney), in response to above:
I believe it is better to not transplant basil, i.e., it is better to put
seeds in the ground where you want it, when it is warm enough for them to
grow. They will quickly outstrip the transplants however carefully they
have been grown and hardened.

Yes, they do tend not to attract many bugs which is a surprise given their
good taste.

-----
From: carole@chenson.demon.co.uk (Carole Henson)
I am addicted to basil, really love it, even the smell is wonderful. I have
10 basil plants in my greenhouse at the moment, and two in the kitchen for
chucking into salad etc. You only need a couple of large handfuls of leaves
for a jar of pesto, so a couple of plants would do it. If you sow a few
seeds at 2 weekly intervals, you should have a constant supply.

-----
From: Dwight Sipler <dps@hyperion.haystack.edu>
There are several different varieties of basil. Mammoth basil has very
large leaves, although the leaves are somewhat savoyed (wrinkled).

I've had good luck with Genovese basil, which I get from Johnny's Selected
Seeds. No particular soil preparation, just normal garden soil, fertilized
every other year, limed as necessary (determined by pH test). I put in
about 600 plants and I always lose a dozen or so to cutworms, critters
etc., but it's not a big problem. I plant marigolds nearby since the
Japanese beetles seem to like them and they keep the beetles off the basil
plants.

-----
From: jmanton@standard.com (Jeanne Manton):
Opal Basil is probably one of our most favorite plants and I was delighted
when my favorite seed catalogue advertised a new purple variety this spring
- Red Rubin. While a hearty grower, I found a very high number of 'green'
starts and the mature plant resembles lemon verbena in shape and texture. I
made a batch of jelly from one harvest and not only was the color more of a
honey shade but it also captured and enhanced the vinegar (rice + wine)
flavor. The leaves are too 'chewy' to be sliced over tomatoes but can pass
the test when added to a cooked tomato sauce. Fortunately I also had a
Purple Ruffles plant for my daughters vinegar as so much of the pleasure is
derived from the lovely lavendar shade.

-----
>basil eaten to skeleton; more eaten each morning, no bugs evident?

From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
There is a caterpillar that seems often to like basil that lives under the
surface of the earth during the day. Gently disturb the top quarter or half
inch of dirt in a circle around the plant going out about four inches or so
and look for a dark gray circle about half to three quarters of an inch in
diameter that usually stays that way and sometimes opens up to get away
(depending on how deep a sleep it is in I guess :-)). If you find it,
squash it and hope. The only other predator I can see that would do what
you have is a lot of slugs so you would likely see them anyway. They can be
taken care of by all the standard beer, diatomaceous earth, etc. methods in
addition to hand picking.

There are few joys as great as finding one of those blasted caterpillars in
the ground after they have been eating your food, let me tell you.

-----
> basil wilting in the sun?

From: bogin@is2.nyu.edu (Josh Bogin)
Probably this is due to not enough water **and or possibly resulting from**
not enough room for the plants. If the plants are root-bound it really will
hardly matter how much you are watering them, since the pot would
presumably be too small to hold much water, the plant would keep drying
out, and also the roots probably get no nutrients. Give them some plant
food, and think about finding them more room, if this is the problem.

-----
From: wolf@gaia.caltech.edu (Wolf)
Here in Southern California, (Pasadena) our sweet Basil that "was" in full
sun started wilting one after the other. Every couple of days, another one
wilted. The sweet Basil we planted in part-shade (Morning shade, afternoon
full sun) is thriving, and the plants are giant. They make great pesto. On
the other hand, we have some purple Basil which is also in full sun, and it
is completely unaffected by the heat. All plants are getting really big,
despite frequent pinching. All plants get plenty of water, and the dirt
around the dying plants was plenty moist.

The instructions on seed packets are simply not meant for folks in the
Southwest.

Sweet basil is heat intolerant. It will do great in full sun if the
temperatures don't exceed 85-90 degrees on average. Any hotter, and it
starts wilting in full sun.

-----
> have basil in pot; can I plant it outside?

From: Debbie Golembiski <102522.1235@CompuServe.COM>
You sure can move your potted basil into the ground. Just cut it back a bit
first and try to move it with as much soil intact as possible.
Basil loves full sun, so pick a spot that gets at least 6 hours of sun
daily.

-----
> saw some basil for sale with huge healthy green leaves that put mine
> to shame.

From: wolf@gaia.caltech.edu (Wolf)
The guys who have these giant sweet basil plants feed them with Urea. Seems
to do the trick. Also, sweet basil doesn't like it too hot, and likes to
have moist soil. Make sure you pinch off any flowers before they go to
seed. If you follow these guidelines, you should get giant plants.

-----
> ...no basil sprouting - too wet for the last three weeks?

From: southsky@maui.net (Rick Giese):
Basil seeds will not germinate when they are constantly wet. I started mine
in flats protected from the winter rains here on Maui. Once transplanted to
the field, they did fine.

=====
2.1.2 Harvesting basil
-----
From: engels@wibla.mv.att.com (engels s.m.):
You can harvest basil leaves as soon as the plant has 3 sets of leaves.
Keep the plants branches shorter than 4 sets of leaves and you will
increase leaf production. Once it flowers, production drops. I've found the
taste stronger before flowering.

-----
From: mmorriso@blue.weeg.uiowa.edu (Mark David Morrison)
Basil leaf harvesting: pick all that you think that you will need for the
recipe that you are preparing. If you have a lot of basil and are freezing
basil for winter then just pick the big leaves. I use a lot of basil and
pick leaves from the plant almost daily. If they are small or big leaves
does not matter... the plant is the hardiest beast in my gardens. I think
it may be of alien origin.

Pinching back basil: Always pinch off and use those tops. The leaves will
really bush out on your basil when you do.

-----
From: kathleen.snyder@lunatic.com (Kathleen Snyder)
Pick all over. Don't strip the stems of all the leaves. Be careful not to
tear the stem when cutting off a leaf. I use scissors. Tearing can some
times strip the stem and damage it.

Pinching will make it fuller. Don't let it flower either. Pinch off the
flower buds the minute you see them coming.

-----
From: stlouins@cnsvax.uwec.edu (Dina)
I often just go out and pluck off as much as I need once the plants are
established--sometimes a third or more of the plant, depending on whether
I'm making salad, herbing vinegars, or harvesting some to dry. Pinching
back makes the plants bushier, and I'd definitely start cutting back when
the plants start to flower. They grow back quickly.

-----
From: David Perry <dperry@bbn.com>
The best method is to pinch them back at the main stem(s) a couple of times
early in their lives. This will create a bushier plant rather than the
single tree looking specimen.

Thereafter, just take the tips of the stems to keep the plant from going to
seed. You will notice the tips become very heavy with small pointier leaves
just before it goes to seed. Clip back any large main leaves when you
notice the secondary buds beginning to show along the main stem, or when
they get too big and seem to be sapping the rest of the plant (these leaves
are great to wrap steaks for the grill, snip for salads etc...mmmmm!)

I also found that the leaves are oilier and more fragrant early in the day
or at night. Of course, most of us don't use basil at 3 a.m.

Also, basil really doesn't have to be spaced out as much as the packet
literature states. I fill 1/2 barrels of basil every year. I thin out only
enough to keep full sun and air circulation on all plants.

-----
From Deborahrah@aol.com:
Growing Basils in Texas
I have had great sucess growing basil in the hot climate of Texas. I plant
my basils in the afternoon shade of indeterminate tomatoes. My basils get
about 6 hours of sun each morning. This shade is necessary, as the basil
leaves will get "bleached" in the scalding Texas sun. Basil is my absolute
favorite and it would be a sad day indeed if I couldn't pick it fresh from
my garden.

=====
2.1.3 Using / preserving basil
-----
Also see Pesto, 4.9.2 below, and Basil jelly, 4.6.1 below.
-----
> ... alternatives for using pesto or fresh sweet basil?

From: jwr3150@tam2000.tamu.edu (Jason Wade Rupe)
I bake it right into bread sometimes.
I like a stir fry of basil and whatever with a basic simple sauce on rice.
Try using it fresh as a pizza topping.

Take GOOD quality tomatoes, preferably ones you've grown yourself :-) and
slice them. Top with fresh mozzarella whole basil leaves. A little
expensive because of the cheese, but it makes a very colorful and tasty
appetizer!

-----
From: french@jeeves.ucsd.edu (Kathy French)
If your basil plants aren't producing fast enough to give you a cup or two
of leaves at a time, you can pinch off stems and keep them with the ends of
the stems in clean water (change it every few days) at room temperature for
several days. Freezing the leaves doesn't work so well, because it will
make them mushy when they thaw, and it reduces their flavor as well.

You can also preserve basil by washing it carefully, drying it thoroughly,
packing it in good olive oil, and keeping it in the refrigerator. Then you
can use the leaves plus oil to make pesto fresh when you want it by adding
garlic, cheese, and pine nuts. I've tried this method and it works well,
although the basil turns somewhat dark in the process.

From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
You can make basil pesto and freeze it in cubes or patties and save it for
the winter when you have nothing fresh to use.

From jmanton@standard.com (Jeanne Manton):
I use Genova Perfum Basil and throroughly wash the leaves in vegetable soap
(available at natural foods stores). Dry completely with paper towels, then
dice (I use a french knife). Pack into sterilized 1/2 pint jars: 1 layer of
fresh ground Parmesan, one layer of basil, one layer of fresh ground sea
salt. Continue layering process until the jar is nearly full. Cover with a
thin layer of extra virgin olive oil and seal. Store in the refrigerator (I
use the coldest shelf). I don't know how long this keeps because we will
use the entire jar within two months but my last really big supply was
still fresh after nine months. Can be used on everything except corn
flakes!

A blooming appetizer:

From: jmanton@standard.com (Jeanne Manton)

1 8 oz cream cheese (neuchaftel is too light but may be substituted)
1 8 oz cheve (creamed goat cheese)
1/8 tsp dried garlic chips, crushed
1 tsp minced (using knife) basil, perferably Perfum

Mix the above together using your hands and shape into a ball. Place on
plastic wrap and flatten. Generously sprinkle with fresh ground black
pepper. Decorate with herbs and flowers (sprig of tarragon, few blossoms
and stems of rosemary, johnny jump ups - whatever) and wrap airtight.
Refrigerate overnight and serve either with a strong cracker or baguette
slices.

This is a real favorite when I take it to work although one of my
co-workers suggested I had dropped the cheese ball in the driveway just
after the lawn had been mowed.

Note: When I make these for Christmas I use sprigs of rosemary and three or
so red peppercorns.

FREEZING BASIL
-----
From Deborahrah@aol.com:
"Fresh is best" certainly holds true for basil. But what to do in the
winter for that fresh taste? I have found a method that works. When my
basil is ready for harvest, I cut off about 20-30 branches early in the
morning. Then I rush it to my kitchen, where I already have a large dishpan
of cold,clean water waiting. I place the basil in the water and gently move
it around slowly.(Putting the basil in the pan and then running water over
it would release too much of the flavorful oils.) I remove the basil from
the water and let it drain in a colander,shaking excess water from the
plant. After a few minutes of this, I place the basil between clean kitchen
towels letting the terry cloth absorb more water. Do not rub the basil with
the towels, as it will bruise it. Next, I take small squares of "Handi
Wrap" about 4" x 4" and place 6-7 basil leaves stacked on top of each
other. I gently wrap the basil with the plastic wrap and put the little
packets in a freezer proof bag. In the winter when I need it, I remove the
basil packet from the freezer. I immediately crush the basil while it is
inside the packet. This method "cracks" the frozen basil into small pieces
which I add to recipes. The trick to this is to "crack" the basil within 10
seconds of removing it from freezer, or you will have soft,wimpy basil. The
basil will taste as good as fresh, but will be almost black in color. It is
the fresh flavor that sells me on this method, not the appearance.

-----
BASIL OIL
-----
From Laurie Otto <lotto@ptialaska.net>
Someone asked about drying basil. In my opinion, it wastes flavor to dry
basil. Better to put it in the food processor with olive oil, make a paste
and freeze it for later use. Or try making salted oiled basil leaves:

Note: Even though a lot of oil is used for this it can be cleaned off
before using the basil so please don't discount this in the interest of
maintaining a low-fat lifestyle! The oil is merely a preservative and it
does keep the basil absolutely fresh for months!

Carefully clean *and dry* each leaf. Use a salad spinner or swing the
leaves around in a clean, dry towel for a few minutes. Pat dry, just to be
sure...:) This is really important, so please be thorough! Next pour a
little virgin- or extra-virgin olive oil into a sealable crock, preferably
a stone one. The small kind used to house cheesespreads are ideal! Sprinkle
a little salt on the oil. Add a single layer of basil leaves, careful not
to overlap them. Cover with a thin layer of oil and sprinkle with more
salt. Do this until the crock is full, then top off with oil and salt.
Seal. Store in the refrigerator and it will keep indefinitely. To use the
basil, simply take out what you need *with a very clean utensil* and, if
you like, wash it well to remove the salt and oil.

I tried to make basil oil the other day. I had a sterile, sealed bottle,
basil from the yard, and olive oil. Put the herbs in the bottle, completely
covered with oil plus a few inches. Supposed to be good for many months but
the basil molded up within 2 weeks !! Help!

From: lgf0@Lehigh.EDU (Lesleigh G. Federinic) to above:
I always refrigerate mine. Only once did it mold on me in the frig but then
I had it there for several months during the winter and hadn't been using
it. I use it up in the summer. It's good for frying zucchini and mushrooms
as well as making angel hair pasta sauce.

From: Yasha@bioch.tamu.edu (Yasha Hartberg)
I'm not sure having never done it myself, but it seems a bit strange to
start with a sterile bottle and then add non-sterile leaves and oil to it
and expect anything less than mold, bacteria, etc. I wonder if you might
not try heating the mixture up a bit before sealing the bottle?

-----
From: aa100465@dasher.csd.sc.edu (J Michel)
For years I've been preserving end of the summer basil leaves in olive oil
with salt (lots - don't know how much - sprinkled on successive additions
of leaves and oil to cover). The leaves turn black in the oil, but not
moldy, and thru the winter I fish out a couple from time to time to use in
cooking. I store it in the refrig. and in summer I toss out the salt which
has settled to the bottom of the jar along with the last of the oil.

I am about to be a convert to the Ice cube basil/oil pesto storage method
in order to eliminate the salt. However, I'd suggest experimenting with
adding salt, or trying refrigeration.

-----
From: rcook@BIX.com (Rick Cook)
The key is moisture. If there's moisture in the plant (as there is in basil
leaves -- a lot of it) you're likely to get mold when you make basil oil.

If you want to make basil oil, grind the basil into a paste, add to the
olive oil to steep for a while in the refrigerator and then filter the
mixture.

-----
From Richard White, Hazelwood Herb Farm, Ladysmith B.C, Canada
<hazelwood@ultranet.ca>:

Re. problems with basil oil: harvest leaves and place in a large pot, cover
with oil (we use canola). On medium heat bring oil to a temperature of no
more than 190 F. Hold at this temperature for 20 minutes. Cool rapidly and
allow to stand overnight. Remove leaves and siphon off oil, leaving
sediment and water behind. Bottle into sterilized containers. It will be
cloudy at this point but will eventually clear. Adding dried basil to the
container will help clear it faster.

DRYING BASIL
-----
> drying basil - how long?

From: Kim Pratt <pratt@olympus.net>
The time factor really depends on where you hang it to dry, what the
temperature is. Mine usually takes about 2 or 3 weeks to dry. That is
hanging upside down with stems tied together in a bundle, in the kitchen.
If you have a dusty house, after tying together in a bundle put inside a
small paper bag that has been punched full of small holes and hang that
(tie the top of the bag to the top of the stems so your herbs are still
hanging upside down).

From: evedex@hookup.net (Eve Dexter)
My dehydrator has a fan and the drying takes only 1 1/2 -2 hours, depending
upon the humidity of the day of course. I suggest you start in the am and
keep a close eye on the process - it shouldn't take too much longer in your
model.

2.1.4 Which basil do you have?
-----
From: farmermj@bham.ac.uk (Malcolm Farmer):
Some suppliers offer different varieties of basil. Chiltern Seeds in the
UK, for example, has about a *dozen* different varieties. Two I have
growing now are:

Lemon basil - thinner, smaller, rather pointed leaves when compared with
regular basil. Has strong lemony odour: when you tear up the leaves the
smell is gorgeous, somewhere between mint and basil.

Thai basil - similar in appearance to lemon basil leaves, but slightly
darker with stems having a purplish tinge. Scent is somewhat like regular
basil, but much spicier and more fragrant. A friend says her Thai cooking
using regular basil never tastes quite the same as authentic Thai, so I'm
going to give her some of the Thai stuff to see if that's the reason....

-----
>> The basils I grow are regular sweet basil, Spicy Globe, lemon basil,
cinnamon basil, licorice basil, and holy basil. ... snip .... I've tried
the holy basil in tea, but don't care much for it. I've read about using it
as an incense/smudge ingredient.
>have you tried using the holy basil in Thai cooking? I've seen a number of
Thai recipes that call for it. From what I've read, it's a hot (spicy)
variety. I've been thinking of growing it, since I haven't found a source
to buy it.

From: culinary@richters.com:
I thought I should jump in here. There is a lot of confusion in the herb
world about "holy" basil. Most of the seeds I have seen on the market is
actually a hybrid of undetermined parentage. It is NOT Ocimum sanctum, the
"sacred" basil known to the Indians as "tulsi" which many people assume.

We call "holy" basil, "spice" basil, following a convention established by
Helen Darrah in her monograph on basils. I actually don't like her choice
of name because it confuses newbies who think that this is the regular
basil for regular basil use, but at least it is better than "holy" basil
which everybody gets confused with O. sanctum.

If you want the real McCoy, you need to insist on O. sanctum. There are
several varieties (purple, green and probably others) and it does turn up
in seeds from Thailand where the plant is grown for use in cooking.

Now, there is also such a thing as "Thai basil" which yet another animal
altogether. If you are looking for the basil used in Thai and Vietnamese
cooking, you will want this. Now, some companies (including us) have in the
past sold "anise basil" as being equivalent to "Thai basil" but we now know
that this is not true.

2.2 Curry plant / Curry leaf

Latin name:
Curry Plant: Helichrysum angustifolium;
Curry Leaf: Murraya Koenigii
=====
2.2.4 Which curry plant / curry leaf do you have?
-----
From: kpmglib@netcom.com (Information Services)
The "Curry Plant" is an herb, Helichrysum angustifolium, from the family
Compositae. I believe it came from Africa or Australia, so it's tropical,
and probably perennial; although in North Texas you may need to grow it as
an annual or in a container (probably not frost-hardy). The name "curry
plant" originated from this herb's pungent smell, which is reminiscent of
some curries or curry powders; however it is not used in curry. I believe
that it is widely cultivated in the U.K., and is used there mostly in
salads, or mixed with cream-cheese.

There actually is a plant that produces what is known as the "curry leaf",
and which *is* used in the preparation of some curries (much the same way
as bay leaf is used). The leaves of this plant, a woody tree from the Asian
sub-continent called Murraya Koenigii, also have a strong curry-like smell,
and can be purchased dried at most Asian markets. The tree itself has only
recently been cultivated commercially in this country, and is carried by
only a very few nurseries. It is still considered an exotic, and commands a
premium price.

2.3 Sage

Latin name: Salvia officinalis, other Salvia species.
Salvia elegans - Pineapple sage

=====
2.3.1 Growing sage
-----
From: Linda Kovacs (kovacsla@vnet.ibm.com)
Sage is a perennial here in zone 5. It's a very easy-to-grow plant. Half a
day of sun, reasonable soil, and don't let it get too awfully dry.

The main problem with sage is to keep it under control. I've never had any
insect problems with it. Pinch small plants to make them branch, then let
them grow to harvesting size. Don't let stems get so tall that they lay
down, or you'll end up with a twisted, woody mess in a couple of years.
-----
Pineapple sage (Salvia elegans)
-----
From: Jennifer Zahn <jszahn1@facstaff.wisc.edu>
I have a pineapple sage plant, and since last summer, the stems have become
tall and woody. Now all but one are dead, and I'm afraid to trim back the
remaining remnant. Any tips on how I can revive this plant? Ideal
conditions? It was inherited and I never learned much about it.
And what do woody stems mean, anyway?

-----
From: Harold <orchids@communique.net>
Hi, Jennifer. If the plant were mine I would cut all of the stems back
close to the ground. New stems will grow from soil level and provide you
with lots of vigorous new growth. You may want to root the tips of the
remaining growth. Pineapple Sage roots very easily and can make a
substantial plant in just one season. If your plant grows too spindly you
can always pinch or cut the stems back part way to cause them to bush out
more.
Woody stems just mean they are old.
BTW, I'm surprised you have living tissue on your plant, considering how
far north you are. Here in southern Louisiana mine die back to the soil
almost every year.

Pineapple sage: The indestructible filler plant

-----
From: weed <avril_tolley@berlex.com>
Pineapple sage routinely gets woody, so prune away. It may be that it just
looks dead. This sage, Salvia elegans, is very easy to root, so if you're
worried about the rest of the plant, take several cuttings from what you
think is the remaining living stem and pot them up. You can dip the end in
something like "Rootone" if you like, but I find they root without it. They
will look dead for a while, and the top may actually die. Eventually you'll
get new leaves near the bottom. Pineapple sage benefits mightily from hard
pruning, although I never go below about a foot and 1/2, because I just
hate to prune. It's a little tender, so sometimes, if I think it may be
exposed to frosts in winter, I'll root a bunch of cuttings and overwinter
them to be sure I have some the next year. I usually end up giving these
away, because mine generally makes it. Hummingbirds love this, as they do
most sage. Really nice plant. Mine is by my front walk, so I have to brush
up against it to get to the garage.

=====
2.3.2 Harvesting sage
-----
From: Linda Kovacs (kovacsla@vnet.ibm.com)
Harvest sage before it blooms. After the dew dries in the morning, cut the
stems, leaving a leaf or two at the bottom. I air-dry my sage, stringing
the stems on a strong thread and hanging it in a breeze.

It will dry leathery rather than crisp, because the leaves are so thick.
Strip the dry leaves from the stems and place the leaves into a jar. Chop
or rub the leaves into powder when you need to use them.

To use fresh sage, clip off enough of a branch to get the number of leaves
you need, strip off the leaves, and chop them up if desired.

   * Stuff a few leaves into the cavity of a trout. Tie with string, baste
     with a little oil and grill. Use only 1 or 2 leaves per fish otherwise
     the sage will overpower the fish.
   * Chop fine, lightly saute in olive oil with minced garlic. Add a little
     chopped parsley & toss with spaghetti or other pasta. Serve as a side
     dish to grilled chicken, fish or meat.
   * Toss a few sage leaves with quartered onion and flattened garlics into

We use sage for stuffing turkeys in addition to chickens, if you have
turkeys in the UK. We also use it in foccacia... ...Sage pesto is another
way to use large quantity of sage and it can be frozen to be used in the
winter. You might use walnuts or pecans instead of the traditional pignoli
nuts in pesto as sage is stronger than basil.
It goes well with pork or chicken. You can also roast eggplant and sweet
red pepper and food process them together with sage for a nice dip to be
used with homemade French bread.

cutting-- and are long-lasting.

Grate cheese on top of the chicken thighs. Spoon some of the hot butter
over the chicken (this melts the cheese) and put one or two sage leaves on
top of each piece of chicken. Fried sage tastes good even without the
chicken.

Focaccia with Sage
From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)

Deriving its name from the Latin word focus, meaning "hearth," focaccia
evolved from the unleavened hearth cake eaten during the Middle Ages. It
was made by patting the dough into a flat round and cooking it directly on
a hot stone or under a mound of hot ashes. While it has become something of
a national dish, this popular bread's true home is the area around Genoa.
It seems as if every seaside resort on the Italian Riviera has its own
special focaccia. Whether soft or crisp, thick or thin, the dough is
typically flavored with local herbs and olive oil.

Sponge:
0.5 cup warm water (105 to 115 deg.F)
1 tsp. dry yeast
0.75 cup unbleached all purpose flour

Place 0.5 cup water in large bowl. Stir in yeast. Let stand until yeast
dissolves and mixture is cloudy, about 10 minutes. Stir in flour. Cover
with plastic. Let stand until very bubbly, about 45 minutes.

Focaccia:
1 cup warm water (105 to 115 deg.F)
1 tsp. dry yeast
0.25 cup plus 2 tbs. olive oil
3.25 cups unbleached all purpose flour
3 tbs. finely chopped fresh sage

Place 1 cup water in small bowl. Stir in yeast. Let stand until yeast
dissolves and mixture is cloudy, about 10 minutes. Stir in dissolved yeast
mixture and 0.25 cup olive oil into sponge in large bowl. Stir in 1 cup
flour. Stir in 2 tbs. chopped sage. Add remaining flour in 2 batches,
mixing until well blended after each additions. Turn out dough onto lightly
floured surface. Knead dough until soft and velvety, about 10 minutes.

Oil large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat with oil. Cover with plastic.
Let dough rise in warm area until doubled, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Oil
11x17 inch baking sheet. Punch down dough. Transfer to prepared sheet.
Using oiled hands, press out dough to cover bottom of pan. Cover dough with
kitchen towel. Let stand 10 minutes (dough will shrink). Press out dough
again to cover pan. Cover with towel. Let rise in warm draft free area
until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Meanwhile, position rack in center of oven. Place baking stone on rack and
preheat oven to 425 deg.F.

Using fingertips, press dough all over, creating dimples. Drizzle dough
with 2 tbs. oil. Sprinkle with 1 tbs. sage.

Place pan directly on pizza stone. Spray oven with water from spray bottle.
Bake until focaccia is golden and top is crisp, spraying oven with water
twice more during first 10 minutes, about 25 minutes total. Transfer bread
to rack. Cool slightly. Serve bread warm or at room temperature.

2.4 Chives

Latin name:
Chives: Allium schoenoprasum.
Chinese chives: Allium tuberosum.
=====
2.4.1 Growing chives
-----
From: Linda Kovacs (kovacsla@vnet.ibm.com)

I started with a small pot from a discount store, planted it in moderately
poor soil that got about 1/2 day sun. It went crazy! Grew big, made flowers
and seeds, the next year the seeds came up and (repeat previous line over
and over and over ... ). I now have about 6 square feet of chives. I don't
even water them.
After they blossom and the flowers dry, you can collect the drying flowers
and shake out the seeds to plant elsewhere. The blossom stems should be
removed to prevent their being harvested by accident, as they are rather
woody and tough. They'll dry out anyway, and should be removed to keep the
plant looking nice.
A funny thing happened with that first plant. It was next to a rose bush
infested with aphids. When I planted the chives, the aphids disappeared.
Then I got a fruit tree that had problems with aphids. I scattered some
chive seeds, and the aphids disappeared again.
Chives are so easy to grow that I don't think I'll ever be without them
again. To get a start, find some chive seeds or a pot of chives.
To grow them indoors, put on a sunny windowsill and water when the soil
gets a bit dry.

-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:

Chives are a very hardy perennial of the same genus as onions, leeks and
garlic. It makes a great container plant and does well indoors if given
adequate light. A 5-inch pot of chives should be divided and repotted every
spring if the clump has spread enough.
Chives like rich, moist well-drained soil with a pH between 6 and 8. It
likes full sun but will tolerate partial shade.
The seeds germinate easily in 10 to 12 days, but the plants grow and spread
slowly at first. It is quicker to obtain a division of a clump from
someone. Plant seeds 1/2 inch deep, in small sparse groups spaced about 12
inches apart all around to create clumps quicker, or plant seeds singly.
Clumps grown outdoors should be divided every 3 or 4 years. Chives make a
good companion plant for beets but should not be planted with beans,
carrots, or tomatoes.

2.4.2 Harvesting chives
-----
From: Linda Kovacs (kovacsla@vnet.ibm.com)

Chives are best harvested with a scissors or sharp knife. Cut the blade as
close to the ground as possible without injuring other blades. It's best to
cut individual blades unless you are shearing the whole plant. This leaves
the newly sprouted blades to grow bigger for your next harvest.
If you're harvesting during or after blooming time, watch out for those
blossom stems. They're tough and woody.
Rinse the blades, gather together in bunches, and cut across with a sharp
knife into the size you need.
When chives are in flower, you can snip off the flowers and use them before
they start to fade.

-----
From: ?

I cut my chives back to the ground about three times each summer. I've
found that this forces them to send up a whole bunch of replacement shoots.
I usually wait to pick a few of the flowers to include in arrangements.

> My chives are flowering. Should I pinch off the flowers so they will not
start to die for the winter?

From: karyn.siegel-maier@kotl.mhv.net

Chives, if well established in the garden, tend to flower in early spring,
and sometimes again in mid-summer. The chive blossoms make an excellent
vinegar, and can be used in baking if pulled apart. I don't cut my chives
back, but let the seed fall to the ground resulting in more chives the
following year.

-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:

Cut off stems to about 2 inches tall, to encourage new growth. Stalks that
flower tend to be rather tough and bitter, so it's better to clip off
flower heads as they form, although they are a pleasant lavender color.

2.4.3 Using / preserving chives
-----
From: Linda Kovacs (kovacsla@vnet.ibm.com)

Chives dry nicely, but lose much of their flavor in the process. If you
want chives in winter, grow a pot on the windowsill.
Chives can be used in any recipe that calls for chopped green onions. This
gives a slightly different, somewhat milder flavor.
Chopped chives make a wonderful addition to salads. I use them instead of
onions when the sweet onions aren't available, because the regular onions
give me terrible heartburn.
Chive flowers are also wonderful in salads. They are both pretty and
delicious, with a peppery-oniony flavor.
Chopped chives are great with potatoes. Baked potatoes with sour cream and
chives is a classic, but you don't need the sour cream. Just baked potatoes
with chives is tasty. Perhaps add a squirt of lemon juice! Also try chopped
chives on top of mashed potatoes, or mixed in.
Chopped chives make a wonderful garnish for almost any non-sweet dish, and
add a mild onion flavor as well.

From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:

Mix chopped chives into cream cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, or
butter. They are great with almost every kind of potato dish, and in
salads. Chives is used in vichyssoise, asparagus and cauliflower soups.
They can be used in egg dishes such as deviled eggs, omelets, and scrambled
eggs. The small bulbs of chives can be used in sausage or pickled like
small onions.
Chives are difficult to store dry due to a high moisture retention, but
they can be chopped and frozen to be used as if fresh.

Potato Casserole

8 large potatoes, peeled cut and cooked
8 oz sour cream
8 oz cream cheese
1/3 c chives

Blend all together, and if your family will let you, refrigerate overnight.
Bake at 350 for 34-40 min or until warmed throughout.
The stem/leaves of chives have high amounts of vitamin A and vitamin C, as
well as some iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, thiamin and
niacin.

From: melnick@stsci.edu (Rita Melnick):
Saffron comes from Crocus sativus, the saffron crocus. It is a fall
blooming crocus. Each flower contains 3 red threads (stigma) that you pick,
then dry, for culinary use. Be sure to get ONLY Crocus sativus, not the
other fall-blooming crocuses, as they are NOT edible.

As for the marigolds, I'm not sure if the above advice applies to all
varieties of marigolds, but I do know that it is true of the pot marigold,
also known as Calendula. It gives the yellow coloring of saffron, but not
the saffron taste. Turmeric is also a yellowing substitute for saffron. But
nothing else tastes like saffron!

2.7.1 Growing chamomile
-----
From: Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>
German chamomile is an annual that reaches 1 to 2 feet tall and is grown
from seed. It prefers a moist sandy soil with a pH between 6 and 8.5, and
full sun. Plant outdoors as early in the spring as possible. If seeds are
planted on June 1, flowers should appear in late July or early August.
Seedlings transplant easily when one to two inches tall.
Center of flower head is hollow.

English chamomile is a low-growing perennial that reaches 1 foot in height,
propagated by seed, cuttings, or root division. It does well in a slightly
acid to neutral soil with good drainage and full sun, but does not do well
in hot, dry weather. Growing English chamomile in rich soil produces
abundant foliage but few flowers.
Center of flower head is solid. Chamomile makes a good companion plant for
broccoli.

> chamomile as groundcover - any experiences?

Anne_E._Comer@kamilche.wa.com (Anne E. Comer)
Chamomile is not usually the recommended choice for *HUGE* areas. It is
sometimes used in mixtures. By itself it is best used in smallish areas
where there will not be heavy foot traffic. It can stand some walking on
and in fact that is one reason that it is used. When trodden on it releases
a fragrance that is very pleasant to many people.

From: Denise Henry <denise@gromet.demon.co.uk>
Remember chamomile is not a grass!! This means that selective lawn
weedkillers don't work. Make sure ground is well prepared with no perennial
weeds and keep the site hand weeded in the first year until the plants grow
together, after that you may still need to hand weed two or three times a
year. A chamomile lawn is something special, but you can tell it was
invented by people of a by-gone age with lots of money and a large supply
of garden laborers. Try it in a small area by all means but only if you are
prepared for some hard work.
(PS. I think it is worth the effort.)

-----
From: naomib@sco.COM (Naomi Brokaw)
I like it, but it's not as carefree as some make it sound. I planted it
last year (check the sections in the nursery where they sell herbs in
flats). I was worried about mowing it before it got established, so I was
going to wait until the cooler weather. Of course, this year, "cooler
weather" meant about 7 months of rain (I'm just south of you, in Santa
Cruz), so I could mow. The chamomile reached up, up, sending sun-seeking
stems into my lavender, rock roses, rosemary, and yarrow. By the time I
finally found the time and weather to mow, it was way too high, so I had to
clip down by hand. That meant taking out most of the green stems and
leaving the brown mat underneath. However, it did grow back the green
within a few weeks, much faster than I feared.

It also has a tendency to die in patches, leaving brown again. Ugly while
it lasts, but if you pull out the brown, the green will close in again in a
few weeks.

I like the smell, but a lot of people find it cloying. On the other hand,
you only smell it if you walk on it or cut it.

I tried mowing it a couple of weeks ago, with our rotary mower. Only a
partial success. Our mower, which is probably dull, though sharp enough for
the weeds out back, tends to pull up some of the chamomile clumps, instead
of cutting them cleanly.

All in all, I'll use it again, but be aware of the drawbacks before you
embrace it. It's a walkable ground-cover with a pleasant color that is
nowhere near as thirsty as grass. Oh, it doesn't do well in medium to heavy
shade. And bees love the flowers, so if you don't want a lot of bees (I
love them), don't plant a lot of chamomile.

The German chamomile, Matricaria recutita is an annual and will reseed

if you want to harvest the flowers for tea.

Roman Chamomile, Chamaemelum nobile, is perennial, probably the most used
form for lawns also flowers.

English Chamomile, Chamaemelum nobile 'Treneague', is non-flowering and is
very good for lawns and pathways but it must be grown from cuttings as
there is no flower, thus no seed.

From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Coriander is a hardy, strong smelling annual native to southern Europe. It
may reach up to 4 feet in height when grown outdoors.

Coriander needs full sun and plenty of moisture, and the soil should be
deep, well-drained, moderately rich with a pH between 6 and 8.

Coriander is easily grown from seed, germinating in one or two weeks, and
self sows well in the garden. Plant seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep, and thin
seedlings to 8-12 inches apart. Sow seeds directly into the garden in the
early spring, or into deep pots; coriander does not transplant well due to
its taproot.

>I've read that the best way to deal with bolting is to do several

From: dplatt@ntg.com (Dave Platt)
I would agree.

Start a few cilantro plants each month, harvest the leaves before they
bolt, and then sacrifice most of the plants before they flower. Leave a few
to flower and set seed - the flowers are very attractive to ladybugs, green
lacewings, and other beneficial (predatory) insects.

I've found that having a few cilantro plants flowering around the garden
provides an excellent defense against aphids.

From: eaplatt@worm.hooked.net (Elizabeth Platt):
Don't let it get too hot--like lettuce, it's sensitive to heat. But,
cilantro is an annual, so most pros advise planting several batches in
succession, so that there's always some that isn't going to seed.

seed, congratulations. All my cilantro is devoured, pronto, by the slugs
and snails as soon as the first tiny leaves appear. Tastiest seedlings in

To avoid bolting, the hotter the weather the more it should be in the

some designed to produce seeds.

>Has anyone been successful in growing lush cilantro? If so, what are your
secrets?

From: Jaime/WildFire Farm <jknoble@INTERSERV.COM>
First, if you want a continuing supply of cilantro, you should succession
plant about every 3 weeks. I know you said you've used seed that is
hybridized for more leaf growth, but here's the following info anyway.

To the more basic question of bolting - you need to get "slow-bolt"
cilantro. There are two types: slow-bolt and regular. The regular is
generally grown for seed, hence the speed to seed. The slow-bolt is grown
for the leaves like you want. It still bolts pretty fast, though.

That's why the succession planting. I always use Shepherd's (I have no
association with them other than as a consumer) because I find I get nearly
100% germination rates & theirs is the slowest to bolt of all I've found.
[If anyone's found a slower bolt seed, I'd love to know about it.]

Look at the cilantro in the store, if it has roots attached you will see
that it is only 10 - 12" high. It pretty much all bolts just about then. I
grow cilantro for commercial use (as well as a lot for my own use) and
generally pull it at about 12". I always pull it, not cut it because it
keeps much better with the roots on and because it leaves space for the
next planting. I do fertilize lightly once just after the first true leaves
appear. It grows nicely in sandy loamy soil. I'm experimenting a little
this year with light shade to keep it cooler in order to see if I can slow
down the bolt even more without losing anything. It works well with
lettuce, so I'm giving it a try. I'll let you know my experiment results in
a month or so.

=====
2.8.2 Harvesting coriander / cilantro
-----
From: dplatt@ntg.com (Dave Platt)
In my experience, the best leaves are the dense, wide ones which grow close
to the ground. Once the plant begins to even _think_ about flowering, it
throws up a vertical stalk, and starts putting out leaves which are much
thinner and lacier. These leaves aren't anywhere near as tasty as the early
foliage.

I've heard some people compare the taste of cilantro to Lifebuoy soap.
To my taste-buds, the thin upper foliage _does_ somewhat resemble Lifebuoy,
and I don't like it at all. The denser low-growing early foliage, on the
other hand, is utterly wonderful.

-----
> OK, my cilantro bolted! Am I going to have to hand pick each of the
little seeds to restock my coriander spice bottle or does someone have an
easier way?

From: eberts@donald.uoregon.edu (sonny hays-eberts):
Take a brown paper bag, and place the seed 'umbrella' inside. shake
heartily. Repeat for each 'umbrella'. This method is useful to harvest some
seed, and keep the rest for hopeful volunteer plants.

For an even easier method, harvest the plant, then beat against the side of
a clean trashcan. Most seeds should fall to the bottom. you'll need to
clean it a bit, but it's lot easier than hand-picking. This method of
course, harvests *all* the seed, as opposed to number 1.

-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
It takes coriander about 3 months to produce seed - to get seed on plants
grown indoors, grow under plant lights. The best leaves to use are the
denser, lower foliage. Once the plant bolts, the lacy upper foliage should
not be used, as it is not as tasty. Leaves should be harvested before the
plant blooms, or seeds should be harvested when about 2/3 of the seeds have
turned a brownish color. Cut the tops of the plant in the early morning
while still wet with dew, to prevent the seeds from shattering.

-----
From: rudy@cae.ca (Rudy Taraschi):
The way I do it is to dry the entire plant, seeds and all. I then get a
large paper shopping bag, hold the dried plant by the stem and thrash it
around in the bag. Most of the seeds usually fall off if the plant is dry
enough.

From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
Even better than a paper bag is the feet of panty hose that you or your SO
has decided are too far gone to wear any more. They are great for putting
over dill and cilantro stems to catch the seed. Just put the toe where the
seed head is and a twist tie around the shin part where it is over the stem
and you will catch almost every seed.

Cilantro goes to seed very quickly. You can eat the flowers, though. They

From Alisa Norvelle <NORVELLE@uga.cc.uga.edu>:

When I buy cilantro for whatever reason, I often have much of the bunch
leftover. This is an easy way to keep from wasting it:

Remove the leaves from the bunch of cilantro. Mash them in a mortar and
pestle with cloves of garlic & salt. The ratio is up to you. I usually use
about 2 cloves of garlic with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and as much cilantro as
I can cram into the base of the pestle/mortar without making a mess.

Once you have this paste, you can roll it in saran wrap and freeze it,
slicing off whatever you need for a particular dish.

Two uses for this stuff (measurements are approximations):

Lebanese Sauteed Potatoes

2-3 potatoes, diced
2-3 T of cilantro pesto stuff
olive oil
vegetable oil

Dice the potatoes small enough so that they fry fairly quickly, e.g., about
the size of one of the keys on your keyboard.
Fry them in the vegetable oil. Remove and drain them as they get done.
Drain the vegetable oil from the pan and add just a tablespoon or two of
olive oil. Return the potatoes to the pan with the cilantro pesto.
Just saute until everything's a good serving temperature.

This never fails to be a crowd-pleaser. Folks will go *nuts* over it! And
no, it is not a part of your fat-free diet.

Lubieh (another Lebanese dish, I don't know how to write it)

I make this vegetarian style. But this is the traditional way:
1/4 lb meat
1 lb green beans
cilantro pesto stuff
olive oil
Lemon juice

Dice the meat into bite-size chunks. Cook it in a sauce pan until it is
good and done--no pink. Add the green beans and a bit of olive oil. Cook
them on a low heat until they begin to exude water. Add the cilantro pesto
in about the last 5-10 minutes of cooking. Squeeze about a half a lemon
onto the meat & beans.

Even prepared the meat-eater way, the amount of meat in this dish is small
for what most Americans-I-know think is a normal meat/vegetable ratio. Eat
it as a meal unto itself or with rice, using pita bread as your eating
utensil.

2.8.4 Which coriander / cilantro do you have?
-----
From: dplatt@ntg.com (Dave Platt)
There's the "slow-bolting" or "leaf" cilantro, and the coriander - they're
the same species, but they're different strains selected for different
growth characteristics. Leaf cilantro grows more of the low, dense foliage,
and it's not as eager to bolt to seed as is commercial seed-coriander
stock.

Culantro
From: endothyr@athens.net (Dennis O'Connell)
Also known as Puerto Rican coriander or spiny coriander. Leaves are 4 - 8
inches long, strap-like with serrated edges, very different from typical
coriander. Taste is similar to (but much stronger than) cilantro.

From: afn23664@afn.org (Ray A. Orosz)
Finally, my culantro (Eryngium Foetidum) woke up! I let some of it bolt,
(Oh, boy does it bolt!), after the little flowers went away, I'm left with
something cone-like where the flowers were. It appears they may be seeds,
but I'm no sure. I'm also starting to get tired to get stung with the
prickles around it every time I check to see what's happening. Are they
seeds, or should I just cut them out and send them up the river?
Exactly, how does this thing reproduce?

From: Rastapoodle@newsguy.com (Rastapoodle)
Culantro has vicious seed heads, with prickles like hypodermic needles.
The seeds are within that nasty seed head. I just snip them off after they
open and collect the seed. Cutting off the seed heads as soon as they form
(early flowering stage) will result in lusher plants that spread faster.

From: Tristan Hatton-Ellis <Tristan.Hatton-Ellis@bris.ac.uk>
Eryngiums come from the same family (Umbelliferae, which also includes
Carrots, Fennel & Queen Anne's Lace), but most Eryngiums are spiny and
grown for ornamental reasons; the flowerheads are usually surrounded by
several large spiny bracts which are often an attractive shade of metallic
blue, silver or purple. Yours seems to be seeding very early, but then you
are in a pretty warm climate! The cone-like structure is the seedhead, and
is the best way of propagating Eryngiums. When it is dry the whole thing
can be picked and the seeds shaken out. Fresh seed should germinate quite
quickly; if you leave it it may need a period of cold to encourage
germination.
Alternatively, you can take root cuttings, but since the plants dislike
disturbance this is best done in early spring so the plants can establish
again before summer.

Vietnamese Coriander
From: Rastapoodle@newsguy.com (Anya)
Vietnamese Coriander (Polygonum odoratum) is a low-growing spreading plant
with tender stems and small light green leaves, and resembles a wandering
Jew (Transcendica spp.). It has a pungent smell, not like
coriander/cilantro at all. It likes wet, semi-shady locales.
It is used in Vietnamese cooking, in soups, stir-frys, etc. I have made a
delicious vinegar with it. Too bad mine died, and I can't get it anymore.
It is believed to be an anaphrodisiac, and the Buddhist monks use it a lot
for this reason.
I don't know if it is a perennial in cold climates, better to pot it up and
bring it indoors, as it is tropical.

of some sort. You can bury the container if you want. Good containers to
use are those big multi-gallon types that roses come in. Bury it right up
to the rim. Otherwise, in a few years, you will have only one herb in your
garden and that is mint because it is VERY invasive.

From: Gary & Jeanne Ross <ross@together.net>
Spearmint will keep spreading unless you start pulling some of it out by
the roots. We however have let it and several other mints spread thruout
the lawn. It smells so great when you walk across it.

>I've got way too much peppermint / mint / spearmint ...:

   * From: hattie@netcom.com (Susan Hattie Steinsapir)
     Make a simple sugar syrup and add a whole lot of fresh mint to it. Use
     this when making granita or to sweeten sun tea. Lemonade made with the
     mint syrup would be nice, too.
   * I like to make iced tea heavily minted. Steep a whole lot of mint with
     the tea bags. Or better yet, boil them with the tea water, then add
     the tea and steep. Discard the leaves.
   * Make cold Asian type noodle salads with finely chopped mint added. I
     use mint to line a bowl in which I'm serving fresh whole strawberries.
     Don't see why you couldn't use them to line a bowl in which a fruit
     salad will be served. Melon salad would be nice.
   * Some middle eastern dishes call for lamb and mint. Ground lamb and
     finely chopped fresh mint (and a few other goodies) would make
     interesting meat balls.
   * Use it in flower arrangements. I've put rosemary branches and mint
     leaves together when I wanted something but hadn't picked up any fresh
     flowers.
   * Give it away to your friends!

You also might want to preserve it in vodka or aquavit...

From: asnell@interaccess.com (Amy Snell)
Boil a handful of peppermint leaves in a pot of water, strain it, add sugar
and serve over ice ... wonderful peppermint drink -- tastes a lot like
candy canes, but very summery. Also good hot. Leftovers can be frozen in an
ice cube tray and popped into iced tea to make it minty.

From: thavey@boi.hp.com (Tom Havey):

   * Pesto.....a bunch of peppermint leaves, some peppermint or walnut oil,
     a bit of sugar, all whipped up in a food processor.
   * Dried, put in decorative jars for gifts, or mixed in some homemade
     potpourri stuff.
   * Tea.
   * Raviolis stuffed with peppermint, pepper and raisins and a bit of goat
     cheese (or cottage cheese) topped with a light and spicy curry sauce.

From: libby@igc.apc.org (Libby Goldstein)
Just add it to water or seltzer, crush it a bit and serve over ice. It's
lovely.

Mint planted at the kitchen door keeps ants away.

From: MORAVCSIK@clipr.Colorado.EDU (Julia Moravcsik)

   * You can make tabouleh with the mint.
   * You can boil water with sugar and dip the leaves in for crystallized
     mint leaves.
   * You can freeze them for later use.
   * You can make a sort of pesto by putting them in a blender with some
     oil and then freezing the pesto for later use.
   * You can put it in fruit salad, chopped fine.
   * You can chomp on a leaf before you drink water to make the water taste
     better.

One of our friends describes chocolate-mint leaves (a variety of mint that
has a taste of chocolate to it) as a great "social lubricant" for her
5-year old son. All the neighbor kids love it, and it has made him rather
popular.

From: snielsen@orednet.org (Susan L. Nielsen)
Tea from spearmint is a pretty usual solution; I find it perkier than
peppermint. It also makes a terrific addition to iced tea made from regular
black tea. We make what is conventionally called sun tea by the gallons all
year 'round, though without the sun. Seven tea bags (good ol' Lipton's or
Red Rose) steeped all day in a gallon jug of water will make good tea for
icing with or without Sol. Use the spearmint fresh, or dry it, or freeze it
in baggies. I also add it to raspberry leaf tea (calcium boost) because the
raspberry has very little flavor of its own. Straight mint tea is good for
bad tummies.

From jmanton@standard.com (Jeanne Manton):

Mint allegedly has a root system extending 18 - 22 inches beneath the
plant. I had mint planters built 18 inches x 18 inches x 26 inches deep.
The mint hadn't read the same book because you always can tell where I have
been living - yep, mint sprouts! This year the apple mint drowned and froze
so I replaced it with pineapple mint - very pretty varigated leaves I use
with cut flowers. When I made my mint jelly for the year I used the
pineapple mint with crushed pineapple. This was supposed to be Christmas
presents but ........ oh, well, I will have another crop shortly.

Orange Mint Vinegar

From: DonW1948@aol.com
1 sm Orange; peel; thin spiral - colored portion only
1/2 c Mint leaves; fresh
Vinegar, white

Remove peel (colored portion only) from 1 small orange in a thin spiral,
and place in a sterilized pint jar. Lightly bruise 1/2 cup fresh mint
leaves, add to jar. Heat apple cider or distilled white vinegar to just
below the boiling point. Fill jar with vinegar, and cap tightly. Allow to
stand 3 to 4 weeks. Strain vinegar, discarding peel and mint. Pour vinegar
into a clean sterilized jar, adding a new sprig of fresh mint, if desired.
Seal tightly. Use in dressing for tossed green salads with orange and
grapefruit sections, or in marinades for chicken or lamb chops.

-----
Mint jelly, apple based

From sherae@zeta.org.au (Sheri McRae):
4 lb. tart apples
3 cups strong mint water
2 cups white vinegar
sugar

To make the mint water, soak a large quantity of mint (about a pound) in 3
cups boiling water overnight. Next day, chop apples and place in a pan, and
barely cover with water. Cover and simmer about an hour until apples are
soft. Strain. Combine apple juice, mint water, and vinegar and strain
again. Measure and place in a pan, adding cup for cup of sugar. Stir until
the sugar dissolves. Bring to boiling and cook rapidly until the jelly will
set. Bottle and seal. Mint Jelly is good with meats, especially lamb and is
also good on toast, etc.

I haven't tried this recipe but it came from a reliable preserving book
which I have used and like.

-----
Mint jelly

From mcat@epix.net (Molly)

I've made mint jelly from my prolific mint patch. I didn't use any apple
juice base, just boiled the crushed leaves in water, strained, added sugar
and pectin. I think the recipe came in the pectin box, they've got an 800
number there also for other recipes. There's also a recipe in my WD
Encyclopedia of Cookery:

1 1/2 cups firmly packed fresh mint leaves and stems
2 1/4 cups water
2 Tbs strained fresh lemon juice
Green food coloring
3 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 bottle liquid pectin (nowadays that means one pouch Certo)

Wash mint, put in large saucepan, crush with masher or drinking glass. Add
water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, cover and let stand 10 min.
Strain, measure 1 2/3 cups into large saucepan. Add lemon juice and a few
grops of food coloring. Stir in sugar, bring to a full boil over high heat,
stirring constantly. Stir in pectin, bring to a full rolling boil, boil for
1 min. Remove from heat, skim, pour into hot jars, and seal.

If you're looking for other ways to use mint leaves, you can candy them and
use them for garnishes on cakes. Dry them and add an interesting taste
while cooking lamb or pork. Mint and Elderberry flower is supposed to be a
great combination for fighting colds and flu. Mint is very calming to an
upset stomach, as well as freshening the breath.

Try mint jelly once, at least, to see for yourself if it's worth it. Good
luck.

From: Leslie <duncan@ISYS.CA>:
I like mint in Middle-Eastern salads. Tabouleh & Fattoush both use up a lot
of mint & taste great.

Tabouleh

3/4 cup bulgur (cracked wheat) medium or fine.
3/4 cup water
2 large bunches parsley
large bunch mint
4 green onions
juice of 2 lemons
1 1/2 teasp. salt
1/4 cup olive oil
2 large, ripe tomatoes
(Note to Chileheads: we usually add about 3 chopped Habs, & a teasp. of
Tabasco to this salad.)
Place cracked wheat and water in a large bowl and set aside to soak for one
hour.
Meanwhile stem off the parsley, mint and onions and wash thoroughly. Chop
very fine.
Squeeze cracked wheat between the hands to remove excess water. Return to
the bowl and add the greens. Add lemon juice, salt and olive oil, adjusting
the amounts to your liking. Sometimes two or three tastings are called for
until the right balance is acquired. Dice one tomato and add it to the
salad. Slice the second tomato to use in decorating the dish.
You may want to serve Tabouleh on a bed of lettuce.
Tabouleh is usually scooped or spooned onto Romaine lettuce leaves and then
eaten. I find this a bit messy, so I prefer eating it with a spoon.
Makes 4-6 servings. From Nadia Farah's Cooking the Middle Eastern Way.

Fattoush (Middle Eastern bread salad)

2 large stale pita breads, torn into 1 in. pieces
1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 lb ripe tomatoes (about 3) seeded and cut into 1/2 inch cubes
6 green onions, cut into 1/4 inch slices
1 green bell pepper, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley
1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh mint
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Freshly ground black pepper
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spread the torn pita on a baking sheet in a
single layer and bake until dry, 10-15 minutes. Cool.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the cucumbers, tomatoes, green onions,
green pepper, parsley, & mint.
Whisk together the garlic, lemon juice and olive oil. Season with salt and
pepper to taste. Toss this dressing with the vegetables. Toss in the bread.
Spread on a serving platter, serves 6-8.

Salatat Laban (Yogurt Salad)

2 cups natural yogurt
1/2 large cucumber, finely diced
2 teasp. mint finely chopped
salt
1/4 clove garlic, crushed
Add the other ingredients to yogurt. Stir until smooth. This is a
refreshing salad on hot days, & a nice accompaniment to sandwiches. Makes 4
small servings.

2.9.4 Which mint do you have?
-----
Also see the Monarda / Beebalm entry, as this plant is often used like
the mints: 2.24 below.
-----
From: conrad@richters.com (Conrad Richter)

Mints - Mentha spp.
Seeds -- Do not buy

The best mints cannot be grown from seeds. They are propagated asexually
either by cuttings or division. Often seeds are offered in catalogues or in
seed racks, but the plants that grow from these will be inferior rogues not
worth the bother. The flavour and odour may have some degree of menthol,
but the mix of oils is almost always a disappointment to anyone who has
enjoyed the fresh, clean scents and flavours from a good spearmint or a
good peppermint.

Peppermint (Mentha x piperita) is a natural hybrid, probably between
watermint (M. aquatica) and spearmint (M. spicata). Its flowers are sterile
and so are incapable of producing true peppermint seeds. What is usually
sold as "peppermint" seeds is actually a type of spearmint. The highest and
best use of this rogue mint is for medicinal tea, but it is not nearly as
nice as true peppermint.

Even though spearmint flowers are fertile and are capable of producing
seeds, seeds produce disappointing results. In most cases seeds bought as
"spearmint" will turn out to be the same menthol-smelling variety sold as
"peppermint."

Why does the seed industry continue to sell mint seeds? For years the seed
industry has had little interest and expertise in herbs. Herbs tended to be
sidelines that produced profits and as long as people continued to buy, the
industry did not care. This is true of oregano and remains true of other
herbs as well.

There are some mints, however, that can be grown true from seeds. Watermint
(M. aquatica), applemint (M. suaveolens), corn mint (M. arvensis) and
pennyroyal mint (M. pulegium) all grow from seeds.

But for the beginning herb gardener who just wants one mint for tea and
perhaps one for lamb chops, it is better to get plants. There are many good
quality spearmint strains and hybrids including English mint, improved
spearmint, curled spearmint and the plain Jane, regular spearmint. Among
the peppermints, the most commonly available variety is black peppermint
(M. x piperita vulgaris), but there are others, like the new "chocolate
mint" which, incidentally, some swear really has a "hint" of chocolate it
its aroma profile.

When buying plants beware of the impostor mints grown from seeds. Just
because mint plants are offered for sale in a reputable garden centre does
not mean that the cultivar offered is a good one. Many large growers are
growing mints from the same rogue seed varieties sold by the seed industry.
Always let your nose be the judge; and don't be afraid to squeeze a leaf to
allow the scent to escape into the air.

2.10 Feverfew and Pyrethrum

Latin name:
Feverfew: Tanacetum parthenium (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium)
Pyrethrum: Tanacetum cinerariifolium
=====
2.10.1 Growing feverfew - it does not seem to repel bees.
-----
>I bought a feverfew plant today with high hopes of introducing it to my
herb garden. Now I have read (of course I couldn't research before making
my purchase) that bees can't stand the smell of feverfew and won't come
near a garden with feverfew in it!

From: James Michael Kocher <jk1n+@andrew.cmu.edu>
I watched with delight last evening as the bees visited the heavy blossoms
of my foxglove, which are growing right next to feverfew. I have never
noticed a lack of bees, and feverfew grows all over my garden.

-----
From Rene Burrough <100735.543@compuserve.com>:
Feverfew is one of my favorite garden herbs, and I let it self seed
gloriously. I came about having it in my garden as a total mistake. I
thought I was planting an insecticide. It's not, and I'd like to give you
the benefit of my mistake because Feverfew does not contain pyrethrum --
the organic insecticide.

Certainly feverfew, Tanacetum parthenium (formerly Chrysanthemum
cinerariifolium)) is a good companion plant in a vegetable garden. Because
of the flat composite head, hover-flies are attracted to it. Hover-flies
are invaluable for eating the larvae of aphids. Any kind of aphid. So
feverfew does provide a way of eliminating insects.

But the actual insecticidal constituents, pyrethrum & cinerin, are found in
Tanacetum cinerariifolium. Obviously, also a member of the Composite
family. It has finely divided, pungent, grey-green leaves. White daisy
flowers with yellow centers as does feverfew. I don't think T.
cinerariifolium has single & double forms. Certainly there is not a golden
leafed T. cinerariifolium as there is T. parthenium var. Aureum.

Pyrethrum, Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium, has a local name of Dalmatian
Daisy. The leaf of the pyrethrum gives a feathery feeling to the whole
plant while feverfew has a chunkier look to say nothing of seriously lobed,
with scalloped edged leaves.

The leaves of Tanacetum cinerariifolium are concentrated closer to the
ground -- giving a yarrowy kind of look to the base of the herb; while
feverfew's leaves provide a bushier effect, and thus the flower heads
themselves seem to be more part of the plant than above it as with the
pyrethrum.

In the UK it is illegal to make homemade insecticides. In theory one could
extract the juice from the plant to make an insecticidal spray. Legally,
one can buy the powder which is mixed with water to form a spray; some folk
believe it should first be mixed with alcohol and then diluted with water
to activate the active principles of pyrethrum & cinerin. And some
pyrethrum powders are sold in plastic puffer bottles so that a plant can be
dusted with the dry powder.

2.11 Tarragon

Latin name:
French tarragon: Artemisia dracunculus var.sativa
Russian tarragon: Artemisia dracunculus var.inodora

Mexican tarragon / Mexican Mint Marigold: Tagetes lucida. See 2.38.
=====
2.11.1 Growing tarragon
-----
>... can't grow tarragon in East Texas...

From: southsky@maui.net (Rick Giese)
Texas in summer is probably too hot for French Tarragon. You might
experiment with a fall planting. French Tarragon is the preferred type for
cooking, and will not grow from seed.

-----
From: Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu (Lawrence H Smith):
French Tarragon may not be frost hardy in Finland, but in milder climes,
particularly with a bit of mulch, it should be. It can also be potted for
the winter. It likes full sun (though again, I'm not in Texas, so I can't
say for there). Give it any sort of reasonable soil (it's not overly
picky). The major growing tip is to divide it frequently (every 2-3 years),
or it becomes rootbound. So keep giving plants away to your friends once
you have enough for your own use...

=====
2.11.2 Harvesting tarragon
-----
From: Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu (Lawrence H Smith):
While it's growing, the best bet is to just harvest fresh whatever you need
for today by picking off leaves or tips of branches with multiple leaves.

For collecting a lot (drying, vinegar, etc.) you can cut back all the
branches by about 2/3rds, whereupon you should leave them for 8 weeks
before doing so again, supposedly. Personally, I only do a major cutback of
this sort when clearing out before frost, so the time between cuttings is
just what some book said, not experience.

=====
2.11.3 Using / preserving tarragon
-----
From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
Tarragon pesto with pecans is a pretty good way to save it.

-----
From: HeK
Vinegar recipe, anyone? That IS the classic way to preserve tarragon. You
can also dry it or freeze it or freeze it in oil.

-----
From: Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu (Lawrence H Smith):
Vinegar recipe, if you like. Clean/sterilize a canning jar. Stuff with
Tarragon. heat white vinegar (or wine vinegar) to/near boiling. Pour into
jar, seal, put in dark place. Strain off into another jar at a date
depending on your tarragon taste tolerance - 2-6 weeks, or leave it until
used. Adjust amount stuffed & time to taste. A canning jar is used
primarily to reduce the likelihood of the jar cracking when boiling vinegar
is poured into it.

Tarragon dries well - ideally, hang the branches in a dark warm place (such
as an attic, or in a paper bag), and then collect the leaves into a jar for
storage when dry. It freezes alone with a lack of fuss that suggests that
freezing in oil is probably not worth the bother. You can also make up a
flavored oil in a similar fashion to the vinegar recipe, though boiling the
oil would not be a good idea...(warming it a bit might help).

-----
From: Donna Beach <phuyett@CCTR.UMKC.EDU>
Here's another tarragon recipe. I found it in *the Herb Book* by Boxer &
Blck

Baked Eggs with Tarragon

3 sprigs tarragon
2/3 cup light cream
sea salt & fresh black pepper
4 large eggs

Strip one teas of the best tarragon leaves from the sprigs and chop them.
Put the rest in a small pan with the cream and bring to a boil. Remove from
heat, cover the pan, and leave for 20 minutes. Strain the cream and
add salt and pepper to taste. Break each egg into a buttered individual
baking dish and stand them in a roasting pan with enough hot water into to
come halfway up the sides of the dishes.
Cook in a moderate oven 325 deg F until the whites are almost set. Pour a
little cream over each one, just enough to cover the surface, then return
to the oven for another 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the chopped tarragon and
serve immediately.

This book--a nice coffee table book which offers tips on growing herbs and
history of herbal lore--also includes a recipe for scrambled eggs with
tarragon. Two tablespoons for eight eggs. You then serve the eggs on
pumpernickel toast.

There's also a recipe for tarragon soup using a roux from chicken stock,
cream, egg yolk, salt and pepper and fresh tarragon--about four cups of
stock and six sprigs of tarragon. That one's easy enough to figure out on
your own, and strict vegetarians would make adjustments for the egg and
cream.

=====
2.11.4 Which tarragon do you have?
-----
From: HeK
There are 2 kinds of true tarragon: Artemisia dracunculus var.sativa
(French tarragon) and Artemisia dracunculus var.inodora (Russian tarragon).
The French tarragon cannot be grown from seed, it's taste is finer but it
isn't frosthardy. The Russian tarragon can be grown from seed, it's taste
isn't so good but it will survive outdoors in Finland.

2.12 Nasturtiums

Latin name: Tropaeolum majus.
=====
2.12.1 Growing Nasturtiums
-----
From: Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu (Lawrence H Smith):
Not fussy for "growing at all", but do respond well to rich, loose,
well-drained soil & compost, plus regular watering, for growing nice large
plants. Differences with the same variety on different spots have been
dramatic (plants & leaves 2-3 times larger on good spots). Hummingbirds
like the flowers.

-----
From: baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (gwen baker)
If they get aphids - usually after midsummer in zone 5 - simply spray with
a dilute soap. Any kind will work. Then rinse the leaves well before use.

From: Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu (Lawrence H Smith) to above:
Never had much trouble from insects - have had some aphids, had some aphid
damage, but it never amounted to anything worth bothering to control. Most
bugs don't find nasturtiums _that_ appealing.

======
2.12.2 Harvesting nasturtiums
-----
From: Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu (Lawrence H Smith):
I've had good results just picking leaves & flowers as needed for salad -
once established, they produce right up until frost. You probably shouldn't
harvest more than about 1/3 of the leaves from plants you intend to keep
harvesting from.

=====
2.12.3 Using / preserving nasturtiums
-----
From: baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (gwen baker)
Nasturtium leaf is wonderful in salad. Slightly bitter but refreshing. I
don't think it preserves very well and should only be used fresh.

-----
From: Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu (Lawrence H Smith):
Any sort of cress-ish or lettuce-ish use - they are a bit hot like cress.
The flowers are edible as well, and make a nice garnish. Large leaves from
plants in rich plots can be used for lettuce-like purposes in sandwiches
(or hamburgers) - the smaller ones tend to slip out annoyingly. Flowers do
well both in salads, and floating on cold soups. If you like nasturtiums,
you can make them the bulk of a salad, with no need for other greens. Great
for just eating in the garden. Have not tried preserving - I suppose you
could blend up some nasturtium mush and freeze it for use in soup, but it's
basically a fresh thing.

-----
>...toss in a few nasturtium pods for false capers.
So are these before the bloom -- the buds? Or after the bloom -- seed pods?
Do you preserve them?

From: snielsen@orednet.org (Susan L. Nielsen):

Pickled Nasturtium Pods or Seeds

After the blossoms fall, pick off the half-ripened Nasturtium seed pods.
Continue as your crop develops to drop them into a boiled and strained
mixture of:

1 quart white wine vinegar
2 teaspoons Pickling Salt
1 thinly sliced onion
1/2 teaspoon each allspice, mace and celery seed
3 peppercorns

Keep refrigerated and use as a variation for capers.

Taken from 'The Joy of Cooking', Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Rombauer
Becker, Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc., New York, 1975.

=====
2.12.4 What kinds of nasturtium are there?
-----
From: Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu (Lawrence H Smith):
There's your basic nasturtium with green leaves & red & yellow & orange
flowers, the same but with variegated leaves, and a variety with all red
flowers and a "more compact" growth habit (cherry flowered, I think
it's called). I think there is also a climbing variety, but I don't
have any of those.

2.13 Dill

Latin name: Anethum graveolens.
=====
2.13.1 Growing dill
-----
From: kenneth@dicom.se (Kenneth Nilsson)
Here in Sweden dill is the most common herb and there are always
discussions on why it is so difficult to grow. It always (?) dies when
about 3" high and the 'story' here has it that dill is very susceptible to
a root fungus. - By the way, you say "transplanted" dill into your garden.
Does that mean you sow it indoors and plant it out? - The only solution for
ME has been to sow/spread out the seeds from the mature dill flowers in
fall. I take some mature stalks of dill and walk around the garden shaking
them and I have beautiful dill BUT all over the garden. They just won't
grow where I want them to - in nice rows - THERE! It seems as if the seeds
that end up in non-infected soil thrive whereas the others simply don't
make it. If you don't find that untidy, it's worth a try. I guess you can
spread the seeds in early spring too.

From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
First, there are many different dills. The best approach I have found is to
find a dill that that survives the winter wherever you are. Then, it is one
tuned to the environment and will grow better. It will also self seed, both
where you want it :-) and where you don't :-( or :-) depending. It is
perfectly acceptable to seed them very close together.
It is also a good idea to succession plant dill if you want a continuous
supply of it all growing season long.

=====
2.13.2 Harvesting dill
-----
From: Anahita@aol.com (Susan D. Hill):
Dill can be harvested for leaves any time during the growing season. If
you're growing for seeds, wait until the flowers die off and the seeds are
set, then tie little socks around the seed heads. You can use nylon net,
cheesecloth or even old stockings. Any fabric that is porous. Be sure to
tie them on loosely so as not to damage the stem. Once the seeds are dry,
just cut off the stalk and take it inside.

From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
To harvest, assuming they are planted very close together, cut the plants
off at their base that are the biggest. Then, let the remaining plants,
which will be more properly spaced, grow larger until they are crowding
themselves and pick them. Then repeat the process until they are all
properly spaced and then pick the fronds as quickly as they reach their
size because they are preparing to go to seed by then. I pick every frond
while the plants are going to seed and it does not seem to affect the seed
production at all and I get more dill fronds that way :-).

To harvest the seeds, take a pair of panty hose past the wearing stage and
cut them off mid-thigh or mid-calf depending on your preference. Put the
seed head, when it is still green, into the foot of the panty hose and the
leg over the stem. Tie a twist tie around the panty hose on the stem and
wait until the seeds are fully developed and quite dry. Then cut off the
stem below the twist tie, bring it into the house or somewhere else out of
the wind and put it over a big piece of paper. The seed will pretty much
fall off the head as it is dry enough. Don't forget to shake the seed out
of the panty hose leg too :-).

2.13.3 Using / preserving dill
-----
From: jrogow@ridgecrest.ca.us (Judith Rogow)
I always cut some heads with ~almost~ mature seeds to add to my garlic
dill half-sour jars. Adds extra flavour, and looks so pretty against
one side of the jar.

From: Silkia@aol.com
The dill is an aromatic European plant that belongs to the parsley family,
and it bears yellow blossoms that turn into tiny fruits or seeds. The
pungent leaves and seeds of the plants are used as condiments and as
pickling agents. Dill is derived from the Norse "dilla", meaning to lull,
and was formerly given to infants as a soporific.

Dill seeds have a rather acrid taste, and they serve to stimulate the
appetite. The odor of dill is stronger and less agreeable than that of
fennel. The two are closely related but they are not identical. However
dill that is found growing wild in the United States, is popularly called
fennel.

Dill is used primarily to pickle cucumbers, but it should be used more
extensively as a seasoning. Its finely chopped fresh leaves add their
fragrance to potatoes, stews, fish, cucumbers, vegetables salads, and
broiled meats. Dill seeds will render cabbage, cauliflower, meat gravies,
spaghetti sauces, fish sauces, turnips, sauerkraut, and soups (especially
bean and borscht) more appetizing. Add a dash of dill to tomato sauce, or
try using dill and celery in stewed tomatoes. Dill seeds resemble caraway
seeds in flavor, and the two may be used interchangeably.

Dill Pickles

Carefully select and wash good cucumbers, about 5-6 inches long. Pack them
in earthenware jars. Between the layers of cucumbers, place thin layers of
dill, using stalks, leaves, and seed balls. Cover with brine [using about 1
lb. of salt to 3 pints of water]. Place a layer of grape or horseradish
leaves on top, weight down with a large earthen plate. Let stand several
weeks before using.

2.14 Rosemary

Latin name: Rosmarinus officinalis.

2.14.1 Growing Rosemary
-----
By jrogow@owens.ridgecrest.ca.us (Judith Rogow)
This is an herb you can literally kill with kindness! Rosemary will die if
you fertilize her, or water her too much, or plant her in too-rich earth.
Benign neglect will result in big healthy plants. There are two basic types
of Rosemary, the trailing or prostrate type, and a bush type that will, in
time, become large enough to be considered a shrub. These plants have been
used in England in mazes, and in the USA as landscape plantings. Prostrate
Rosemary is an excellent ground cover.

Rosemary comes in various shades of blue-lavender, and there is a pink
version that is a magnet for bees (as is the blue). The leaves are like
miniature pine needles, in a lovely blue-green colour.

Rosmarinus, the herb's Latin name, means "sea spray", and the plant grows
especially well near the ocean.

=====
2.14.2 Harvesting Rosemary
-----
By jrogow@ridgecrest.ca.us (Judith Rogow):
I cut my rosemary back all summer and dry it hung in a closet. This
perfumes my hanging clothing, and keeps it from sunburn.

=====
2.14.3 Using / Preserving Rosemary
-----
By jrogow@ridgecrest.ca.us (Judith Rogow):
I use it for poultry stuffing, and as a tea to soothe stress. Also, the tea
is a wonderful hair rinse for red heads and brunettes. I also use the tea
in a bath when I ache all over from too much gardening.

Rosemary may be dried by hanging sprigs in a warm place, then stripping the
leaves and keeping them in a jar or plastic bag. Uses of this versatile
herb include teas (infusions of the leaves) that make soothing tisanes,
enhancing hair rinses, and lovely fragrant soaking baths.

Leaves are used in cooking and for scented oils, the flowers are often
added to a bride's headdress to insure fidelity.

Rosemary is considered an excellent tonic for headaches, and stomachs. It
is also a traditional memory sharpener. Shakespeare said in Hamlet . . .
"There's Rosemary, that's for remembrance." Mourners in many countries drop
sprays of Rosemary in the coffin of a loved one as a pledge not to forget
the person.

A decoction for the bath

Steep several handful of Rosemary (fresh or dried) in water for an hour at
simmer. Cool and bottle. Add to bath for soothing and scent.

2) Rosemary Water

4 tbs. Rosemary Flowers
1 Nutmeg, grated
2 tbs. Cinnamon, grated
1 QT alcohol spirit (Vodka works well)
Pour liquid over herbs in a clean jar - stand in warm dark place for two
weeks. Strain through cheesecloth or paper coffee strainer. Use as you
would witch hazel, to soothe aches.

3) Rosemary Wine

1 bottle of white wine
1 handful fresh rosemary (or 2 tbs. dried)
2 tbs. dried Borage leaves
Steep herbs in wine a week or more, strain as in #2. This is an excellent
nerve tonic.

4) Insect repellent candle

Crumble dried Sage and Rosemary leaves, mix with melted wax, form into
candle (an easy way to do this if you don't have candle molds is to put a
votive candle in a bowl, pour warm herb-wax in the bowl a bit at a time,
and let harden) and use to keep bugs away.

From: Ron Lunde <ronl@teleport.com>
Here's my recipe for Rosemary bread that never fails. (I use fresh
rosemary, from the planter on the side of my house, next to the grape vine.
Both the rosemary and the grape vine are trying to take over the universe.
I'm waiting to see which wins.)

Rosemary Bread

(Popular for centuries, as legend goes, particularly in southern Europe)

Ingredients:
1 package dry yeast, not too far past the expiration date
1 cup warm water (I stick my finger in it, and it feels "slightly warm")
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves (or dried, I guess)
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 & 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 & 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
Olive oil to grease bowl and baking sheet
1 beaten egg

Destructions:
Fling yeast in water, add sugar. Let stand until foamy. If it isn't foamy,
try again. Should take 5-10 minutes.

Add rosemary, salt, whole wheat flour, and about a cup of the regular
flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until it's all a big lump, with kinda
stretchy qualities around the edges. Add remaining flour, and turn it into
an even bigger lump. Turn it out onto a floured surface (not a cat -- cat's
tend to resent that), and knead it far longer than you
actually want to, or about 8 minutes.

Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for an hour or so in an oiled bowl,
until it's doubled in volume.

Punch down, knead briefly (get rid of air pockets). Shape into a ball, and
scrunch it around so that the top surface is reasonably smooth.

Put it on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Brush loaf with oil. Let rise for
45 minutes or so, until it's doubled.

Brush it with the egg. If you're feeling traditional, cut an 'X' in the top
with a very sharp knife.

Bake at 375 degrees (Fahrenheit -- we're not doing plasma physics, we're
baking bread) until the top is brownish, and you can get a nice hollow
sound when you tap the bottom. That should be 45 minutes, or so. Cool on a
rack. Eat.

It's low fat, high fiber/protein/taste. I like it.

2.15 Lavender

Latin name: Lavandula angustifolia and other Lavandula species.
Also see 3.6 below, 'Growing herbs from cuttings'.

2.15.1 Growing Lavender
-----
by Susan L. Nielsen

Among native plants of the Mediterranean, Lavender must surely be one of
the most adaptable of these sun and warmth-loving plants. It thrives from
its indigenous lands as far north and south as hardy perennials will grow.
It is grown commercially in Australia, as well as in the more familiar
lavender fields of England and France. It will grow even as far north as
Norway, though perhaps not _very_ far north once there.

Lavender is happiest in light, well-drained soils, in a somewhat lean loam.
By lean, I mean a soil not too rich in nitrogen; lavender, like many
plants, will gladly imbibe the nitrogen, and then send this nourishment
into healthy leaf growth. In general, we prefer to cultivate lavender for
its blooms (the leaves are useful, but the blooming plant will, after all,
have leaves enough for most purposes I can imagine). Drainage is at least
as important as soil content. I don't recommend planting lavender in
gravel, but gravel would be preferable to a clay bed. A sandy loam is
ideal. "Just dirt" is probably fine as long as it will crumble in the hand.
Clean wood ash is a helpful addition to the soil.

Lavender likes the sun. Unlike human beings, it is made to flourish under
UV rays (after all, ultraviolet and ultralavender aren't _that_ far apart).

So, give it sun, give it drainage, water it sometimes, and enjoy its heady,
sweet abundance.

Lavender may be propagated by seed, though I would suspect the ability of
some of the cultivars to produce, from seed, plants true to the
characteristics of the parent.

It may also be easily propagated from cuttings. This is the way most
commercial stock is reproduced. In the spring or fall, take cuttings from
new growth. You want small stems, pulled with a "heel" from the larger
branch (pull quickly downward from the angle of the stem, and the "cutting"
will detach with the desired tissue forming the heel). Dust with rooting
hormone if available. Set the cuttings into sand or soil.

Don't, by the way, believe the words on a package of "sterile" soil mix;
treat it to half an hour in a _low_ heat oven (about 65 C degrees or 150 F,
if you can set it that low). Use a shallow pan so that the soil can heat
uniformly; it is very insulating and, if piled up, the inside can still be
quite cool when the outside is hot to touch. Make certain it is cooled
again before you use it. When you are using packaged soil for rooting or
seeding, you will save yourself complications with damping off and other
fungal diseases by ritually observing this practice.

Tend the plants gently, and keep them moist, and when they have rooted,
(new top growth is a good sign) pot them into larger containers and
fertilize them.

In addition, lavenders will layer well in the garden; buried stems will
root along their length and can then be dug up, separated from the parent,
and replanted on their own.

=====
2.15.2 Harvesting Lavender
-----
by Susan L. Nielsen

Lavender flowers should be harvested just before the blooms open. The
flowers will look like fat, purple seeds on a stem. If you miss and must
cut them later, be prepared for the flowers to fall off the stems.
For culinary purposes, it may not be so important that you have perfectly
preserved stems of lavender, but they probably loose some of their
intensity of aroma as they mature on the plant.

All the herbals say that the aromatic powers of herbs are strongest when
the plant has not yet opened to full bloom (true of most all the blooming
herbs), and to cut herbs "in the morning when the plants are perfectly
dry." I have never been able to achieve the match between morning hours and
dryness at this pre-bloom season, though I suppose it depends on the dews
and the rains where the garden grows. The dryness is probably more
important than the morning hour.

Cut the lavender stems as long as you are able. Doubtless some of your
harvest will be used for gifts or crafts. The long stems are most lovely.
They also increase the possibilities available to you (you cannot make
lavender bottles with short stems).

=====
2.15.3 Using/Preserving Lavender
-----
by Susan L. Nielsen

Do not dry your herbs in the sun. "Dry them quickly," say the books, but
direct sun will cause them to fade, both in color and in intensity. You can
spread them out flat to dry if you have unlimited table space.
Or tie them in bundles and hang them upside down. "In a closet," say the
wise authors. Ha-ha. Show me a closet with room for bundles of herbs to
hang undamaged. I hang mine from curtain rods, but I have a window onto a
vestibule where no sun strikes. Hang them from hooks or nails or thumb
tacks. I know it is terribly quaint, but don't leave them there all summer,
fall and winter. They will gather dust, and they will lose potency in time.
Once they are thoroughly dry, store them someplace more sheltered, though
less scenic.

Rosetta Clarkson (in _Herbs and Savory Seeds_, Dover Publications, 1972)
reminds us that, "To retain the full flavor and fragrance [of lavender and
of other herbs to be used for cooking] you must store the herbs in
containers, preferably glass or pottery with tightly fitting covers."
Otherwise, "the oils will in time escape." Good advice for all herbs saved,
though not too good for long stems. Try wrapping them in tissue paper and
keeping them in a carton, drawer or chest. When storing freshly dried herbs
in closed containers, you will do well to check them during the first weeks
for signs of mildew. Turn them out now and then, spread the herbs loosely,
sniff them, touch them, look closely. If all is well, re-pack them.

For culinary use, all experts agree (!) that lavender is strong. Use a
light hand.

-----
THE RECIPES
-----
By Susan L. Nielsen

Beginning with the most simple:

Lavender Tea

About 3 tablespoons fresh flowers (half this amount for dried ones) steeped
3-5 minutes in a pint of water just off the boil. This has a pale straw
color but is plenty aromatic. You might try combining the lavender with
mint leaves, too.

Lavender Vinegar

Use distilled white vinegar. Flavored vinegars and stronger ones will
compete with the herb for your senses. Place "some" (say, a small handful)
in a modicum (say, a pint) of vinegar. Let stand 4-6 weeks. Use it as a
dressing for fruit salads.

Even simpler: a few lavender leaves, washed, scattered into a garden salad
add what the authors of _Joy of Cooking_ (Irma S. Rombauer and Marion
Rombauer Becker) call a "bitter pungency." In the US recently, "bitter
pungency" in the form of radicchio commands a handsome price in the market,
so let not this opportunity pass!

Lavender Martini

(I have not myself tried this, but I promise to, soon)
"Make your martini with your favorite proportions. Use a small sprig of
lavender as the garnish. The oil of lavender is quickly but subtly released
by the alcohol..."
(from _The Forgotten Art of Flower Cookery_, Leona Woodring Smith, Harper &
Row, 1973).

Lavender Fruit Salad

Choose your favorite seasonal fresh fruits (no canned fruit cocktail here).
Peel them as appropriate, reduce to bite-sized pieces. Combine them in a
bowl with 10 or so sprigs of fresh lavender (remember: much less for
dried). Let it all chill for a couple of hours. Serve it with a good splash
of champagne over the top and lavender pretties in the bowl. Another
version of this steeps the salad in a quarter cup of Grand Marnier, then
follows with the champagne at serving.

Lavender Jelly

(Also from _The Forgotten Art of Flower Cookery_)
2 1/4 cups bottled apple juice [I would assume that this requires a clear
juice for a clear jelly]
1 cup lavender flowers
3 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 bottle (4 oz.) liquid pectin

Place apple juice and lavender in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and
remove from the heat. Let stand for 15 minutes and strain. Return 2 cups of
this juice to the heat, add the sugar, and stirring constantly, bring to a
full boil. Stir in the liquid pectin and bring to a rolling boil for 1
minute, stirring constantly.

Remove from the heat, skim off the foam, and pour into jelly glasses with a
sprig of jelly in each glass [and seal]. (Makes about 5 medium glasses.)

Lavender Apple Crisp

Add about a tablespoon of fresh (half that if dried) lavender to your
favorite apple crisp or deep dish pie recipe.

and, by no means least:

Lavender Ice Cream (from _At Home with Herbs_, Jane Newdick, Storey
Communicaltions, 1994, changed a bit)
4 egg yolks
3/4 cups sugar
2/3 cup half-and-half [half cream, half milk]
6 fresh lavender flower heads
2/3 cup whipping cream or heavy cream
2 cups of milk

Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until light and foaming. Gently heat
the half-and-half in a pan with the lavender flowers. Bring to the boil,
then strain into the egg yolk mixture. Return the mixture to the stove and
cook over very low heat, stirring constantly until it is slightly thickened
and will coat the back of a spoon. Do not let it boil. Pour the custard
into a bowl, and refrigerate until it is completely cold. Whip the cream
just until it forms peaks and fold it into the cold custard. Add remaining
2 cups of milk. Process in an ice cream maker, or freeze in the container
in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator. Serve with thin, crisp
cookies.

[O', I do say...]

Now, I know this last is not a culinary item, but I've been very good about
leaving out the 4,012 craft uses of lavender I could have mentioned, and I
did bring these up earlier, so indulge me:

Lavender bottles

Lavender bottles are a very old little whimsy. You must use freshly cut
lavender. Once it has dried, the stems will break as you try to bend them,
and your bottles will fall apart before they are made.

Use a goodly bunch of lavender, 15 to 20 stems with flower heads. Also have
on hand some strong thread.

Neatly bunch the lavender and tie the stems together just below the flower
heads. Wrap the thread several times around the stems to make a strong
band. Trim the thread ends.

One stem at a time, bend the stems over the flower heads. Work around the
bundle, carefully. The stems will form a kind of cage over the flowers. As
the lavender dries, the stems will shrink some, and the "bottle" will be
more open.

When all the stems are bent over the flowers, tie them again at the point
just below the flower heads. Your earlier tie will be obscured. Tie the
bottoms of the stems together, too. Tie tightly, because the stems _will_
shrink. You can tie narrow ribbons over the strings to make things
prettier.

2.15.4 Which Lavender do you have?
-----
By Susan L. Nielsen

"Oh, call it by some better name..." -- Thomas Moore

The _Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology_ (C.T. Onions) considers that
the English word "lavender" derives, through a painful series of
transcriptions, from the Latin *lavare* (to lave, to wash), though
Professor Onions comments that, if this is so, "the sense-development is
obscure." Perhaps he was unfamiliar with lavender-scented baths.

*Lavandula* varieties are many, and the manifold literature does not come
to any tidy agreement on the number of lavender species. At last I went to
_Hortus Third_ to settle the matter. While this is specifically a North
American reference, I do not believe there can be too many examples of this
herb not now grown somewhere in N. America.

The following is a fairly tedious list but, because of the large number of
names under which lavender is sold, I have listed the subspecies and
cultivar names (forgive me, but I have omitted the convention of italic
markers for genus, species and variety names; cultivars are in single
quotes). The list is somewhat abbreviated. All names not listed are judged,
"without botanical standing.":

   * L. angustifolia: ENGLISH L. (synonyms = L. delphinensis, L.
     officinalis, L. Spica, L. angustifolia, L. pyrenaica, L. vera).
     Cultivars = 'Alba', 'Atropurpurea', 'Compacta', 'Dutch', 'Fragrance',
     'Hidcote', 'Munstead', 'Nana', 'Rosea', 'Twickel Purple', 'Waltham'.
   * L. dentata: FRENCH L. (also, previously, sometimes referred to as L.
     delphinensis). Var. candicans.
   * L. lanata: (plants offered under this name may sometimes be
     angustifolia).
   * L. latifolia
   * L. multifida: (synonym = canariensis)
   * L. pinnata: Var. Buchii.
   * L. Stoechas: SPANISH L., FRENCH L. (synonym = pedunculata).

Some folklore: Three of the above names are interesting in history.

   * *L. Spica* (spike Lavender [who says Latin is tough?]), shows in its
     name the earlier use of the term "Spike" to refer to lavender (as,
     Culpeper's Oil of Spike). The Greeks called this plant, 'Nardus.'
     Bible readers will here recognize the name Spikenard: "While the king
     sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof."
     said the dark, passionate lover in "The Song of Solomon" (1:12), and
     "Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;
     camphire, with spikenard, spikenard and saffron, calamus and
     cinnamon..." (4:13,14).
   * *L. vera* (English Lavender), is also called "true" Lavender, and *L.
     stoechas*, French Lavender. Obviously there is room for a
     cross-Channel rivalry here. The English Lavender claims to possess the
     finest, true lavender scent: *vera*. In fact, it is the basis of the
     huge commercial market in lavender. French Lavender, on the other
     hand, (according to dear Mrs. Grieve, _A Modern Herbal_, 1931,
     reproduced by Dover Publications, 1971), is "probably the lavender so
     extensively used in classical times by the Romans and Libyans as a
     perfume for the bath." This is a fairly distinguished citation, which
     endures despite the fact that its aroma is judged by some to be
     "musty," by others "musky" (a distinction one might have thought more
     clear), and, by the more discriminating, "like a cross between
     lavender and rosemary."

So, among these worthies, the question remains, which do you have? Or even,
which do you want to have?

The above list should help if you have purchased lavender with a nursery
tag in the pot and are unsure where you stand among the synonyms.

If you have no lavenders, or wish to increase your holdings, and are
looking for guidance, you might consider the attributes you most seek. If
you are very involved in processing, and want to extract oils, for
instance, you might choose the larger-leaved Spike varieties for a greater
yield of oil. Be forewarned, however, that oil extraction requires
_enormous_ quantities of material for a start.

If you live in a harsh, cold-winter area, the hardier L. angustifolia
(vera) might be your best choice.

For deck or terrace edging, parterres, or walkway borders try the smaller
varieties: Hidcote, or Munstead, for example.

If your lavender has wooly white foliage, in a mound of about 12" height,
and blooms late in the season on towering stems topping at 3' or so, you
probably have L. lanata. Its scent will be similar to that of L.
angustifolia.

The L. pinnata and L. multifida cultivars have greyish, ferny foliage.

L. dentata has little "teeth" along the edges of the leaves. Its scent is
said to suffer from the same shortcomings as that of the Stoechas
lavenders.

For historical interest, or from the standpoint of a collector, of course,
one cannot have too many lavenders. And all of them are equal candidates
for inclusion in the garden.

2.16 Lemon balm

Latin name: Melissa officinalis.
=====
2.16.1 Growing Lemon balm
-----
From: jera@ksu.ksu.edu (JR Schroeder)
Lemon Balm, is a hardy perennial member of the mint family (Lamiaceae).
I've found it easy to propagate from seed or by dividing the clump in
spring or late August; cuttings don't seem to work well. A mature plant
forms an ordinary-looking rounded clump that's about 2' across. It doesn't
spread as rampantly as some of it's relatives, although it can become weedy
if you let it go to seed (this is a good way of getting little plants to
share, though :) ).

There is a variegated form, very attractive but less vigorous (it is hardy
in my Zone 5 winters). I've found that if you stress this form, it reverts
to completely green, until it recovers from the stress (which may take the
rest of the season). I haven't tried propagating this one from seed; it is
true from cuttings and divisions.

=====
2.16.3 Using / Preserving Lemon balm
-----
From: doliver@minerva.polaristel.net, Northwind Farm Publications
Someone asked about lemon balm tea: should it be used fresh or dried, etc.
We are great lovers of lemon balm tea. We grow a patch of it, harvesting
the leaves all summer for fresh tea. In the fall, we gather the crop and
air-dry it for winter. The flavor is different depending on whether it is
fresh or dried; I prefer the fresh, but dried is fine. Bruising the leaves
before brewing the tea definitely intensifies the flavor.

To prepare the tea, just steep the leaves in boiling water for a few
minutes. Personal taste will determine the amount to use (don't skimp) and
the brewing time. Try adding some of your other favorite tea ingredients
for a little variety. Chamomile and hops make a soothing (maybe sedative or
soporific for those sensitive to these ingredients) combination with the
lemon balm.

I have never heard of any toxic effects or contraindications to the use of
lemon balm. From personal experience, I'd say it's perfectly harmless.

From: ericf@central.co.nz (Sue Flesch)

Put some fresh stalks in a muslin bag or similar and hang over hot tap

> What can I do with all this lemon balm?

From: denysm@vcn.bc.ca (Denys Meakin)

It makes a good refreshing tea. Just steep a stalk with the leaves in
boiling water for a few minutes. Experiment with different amounts until
you get the strength of brew you like. You can dry the leaves for making
tea in the winter.

-----
Lemon Balm Cordial
From Vicki Oseland <vikio@earthlink.net>, quoting 'The Complete Book of
Herbs and Spices' by Sarah Garland:

4 sprigs lemon balm
2 sprigs hyssop
2 sprigs basil
2 sprigs mint
2 sprigs sage
1 Tbs. chopped, crushed angelica root
2 oz. sugar
2 1/2 cups brandy

Steep the herbs and sugar in the brandy for a fortnight, shaking
occasionally. Strain and repeat with fresh herbs if the taste is not
sufficiently pronounced. Strain and bottle. Take a Tbs. of this digestive
before meals.

2.17.1 Growing garlic
-----
From: TKSJOHN@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu (John Pedlow)

Plant a clove every place you'd like a garlic plant to grow next year.
"Regular" garlic does not get "seed" heads. Rocambole garlic does. The
"seed" heads are not really seeds but are "bulblets" which may be planted
and will develop into garlic in a couple of years. These bulblets do have a
garlic flavor but I find them a bit bitter compared with garlic cloves.
Btw, my rocambole is just slightly smaller (head size) than my "regular"
garlic. and, I am unable to taste a difference between the two varieties.

-----
From: sallee@aol.com (Sallee)

The little bulblettes which are formed after the flower are the seeds for
the garlic plant, but they must be planted in the FALL to make big
beautiful garlic bulbs the following fall. Actually, the garlic knows the
best time to plant itself -- when that head dries, it drops it's seeds at
just the correct planting time.
The garlic also tells you the best harvesting time for the bulbs for
keeping and eating -- when that gooseneck flower stem unwinds fully, the
bulbs are fully formed, but have not yet started to petal outward. The
bulbs are still tightly closed and keep well.
I've grown award winning garlic in Nebraska for years by letting the plants
tell me when to pick this way.

Garlic jam

From: Sam Waring <waring@ima.infomail.com>

4 Garlic head, whole (~14 oz)
1 T Olive oil, extra-virgin
1 md Onion; unpeeled & halved lengthwise
Salt (opt)

Preheat the oven to 350F. Using a large sharp knife, cut off 1/2-inch from
the top of each head of garlic to expose some of the flesh.
Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the oil over the bottom of a gratin or glass pie
dish. Place the garlic and the onion halves cut sides down in the dish,
cover tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes, until very soft to the
touch. Uncover and let cool for 20 minutes. Peel the onion halves and
finely chop them. Place in a medium bowl.
Squeeze the garlic pulp from the skins into the bowl; discard the skins.
Using a fork, stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and mash with the onion
and garlic until thoroughly incorporated. Season with salt if desired. (The
garlic jam will keep refrigerated in a glass jar for up to 2 weeks.)
Makes 1-1/3 cups.
Use this condiment with roasted meats or as a spread for toasted croutons
or cold meat sandwiches, or try a spoonful of it mixed into homemade salad
dressings and sauces.

Garlic bulbs - intact - keep well if given enough air about them. I keep a
pound or so on hand, ordinarily, in a bowl on the counter. If it starts to
go bad, usually you'll notice that it's sprouting much as an onion or
potato would.
It's great baked - then squeeze the paste out onto toasted baguettes.
Absolutely *DO NOT* store it in oil. Doing this can lead to death by
bacterial contamination.
I don't know about freezing it. I usually use it up before I really have to
consider such a course.

From: ness@tc.fluke.COM (Jerry Ness)

I break up the garlic bulb and peel each clove of garlic. I put all the
cloves of garlic in one of those pint jars with the glass lid, wire bale
and red rubber gasket. I fill the jar with Gallo cocktail sherry and put it
in the 'fridge.
I tried the oil method with the same kind of jar in the 'fridge but after a
couple of weeks the hiss of exhausting gasses when I opened the jar made me
more than a little suspect that something wasn't right with this method.
I have had no spoilage problems with the sherry/garlic method. An extra
bonus is the garlic flavored sherry for stir fry, Yum!

The best part of a pickle is the pickled garlic. It's the safest thing for
me to eat - I can eat about 3 of them and not salt out. I've seen pickled
garlic in the stores. It costs 3 USD to 4 USD for a half-pint. Garlic is
cheap, this stuff is way overpriced! So, I wanted to pickle it myself but
needed a recipe. Voila! Here's a recipe for pickled garlic from the Kerr
Kitchen *Pantry*.

Pickled garlic

3 cups peeled garlic cloves (this was the tough part!)
1.5 cups white vinegar (5 percent acidity)
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 t pickling salt

Add garlic cloves to pan of boiling water. When water returns to a boil,
boil for one minute. Drain and pack into hot half-pint jars, leaving 1/2
inch headspace. Heat vinegar, sugar, and salt to boiling. Pour boiling
pickling liquid over garlic, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Carefully run a
nonmetallic utensil down inside of jars to remove trapped air bubbles. Wipe
jar tops and threads clean. Place hot lids on jars and apply screw bands
firmly. Process in Boiling Water Bath Canner for 10 minutes.
Yield: 3 1/2 pints.
I'll probably use less sugar, more salt. I know that I'll add hot pepper
flakes for some extra kick.
As an addendum, from Susan Hattie Steinsapir:
When I pickled the garlic, I soaked it overnight in the fridge in vinegar.
I poked holes in it so the vinegar could penetrate it better and then I
boiled it in the vinegar. I didn't use sugar at all but used more salt. I
haven't opened a jar yet but gave one to my sister. She was thrilled.

Garlic Soup 1

1 clove garlic
2 tbs. olive oil
3 tbs. butter
1 large onion, finely chopped
3 Cups chicken stock
4 slices white bread, crusts removed
2/3 Cup light cream
1 ounce blanched almonds, finely chopped
Garnish: fresh parsley or chives, chopped

Separate the garlic cloves, removing the papery skins. Heat the oil in a
pan, add the garlic, and cook for 10-15 minutes until tender. Remove from
the heat. Cook, then skin. Roughly chop the flesh.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the garlic and onion, cover, and
cook over low heat for 10-15 minutes until the onion is soft. Pour in the
stock, add the bread, and simmer for 30 minutes.
Transfer the soup to a blender or food processor. Add the cream and almonds
and blend until smooth. Garnish and serve
NOTES: Garlic that has been smoked over oak chips adds a great flavor but
regular garlic will work quite well.

Garlic Soup 2

1 whole garlic bulbs
2 quarts water
2 teaspoons salt
a pinch of pepper
1/4 teaspoon sage
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon bay leaf
4 sprigs parsley
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 whole egg yolks
4 tablespoons olive oil
some grated Parmesan cheese

Separate the garlic cloves, drop into boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain,
plunge into cold water, and peel. Put the garlic with the 2 quarts of
water, salt, pepper, sage, thyme, bay leaf, parsley, and olive oil into a
large saucepan and boil slowly for 30 minutes. Adjust seasoning.
Beat the egg yolks in a soup tureen until they are thick. Beat in the oil
very slowly, as if making mayonnaise. Just before serving, beat a cup of
the hot soup into the egg mixture slowly, so that the eggs heat gradually.
Strain in the rest of the soup through a sieve, beating constantly; keeping
back the garlic and seasonings. Press the garlic against the sieve to get
the juice out. Serve at once with fresh French bread or croutons and
cheese.
Alternative: instead of the oil and egg mix in the tureen, strain the soup
and return it to the pot. Add 3 cups potatoes, diced, and a pinch of
saffron; simmer for about 20 minutes until the potatoes are tender.

Garlic Soup 3

1/2 cup oil
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
8 oz stale white bread, crusts removed, crumbled
1 teaspoon paprika
pinch salt
pinch cayenne pepper
4 cups water
3 whole tomatoes, peeled and coarsely
2 whole eggs, lightly beaten
Garnish: 2 sprigs parsley, finely chopped

Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the garlic and saute until soft but not
brown. Add the bread and cook over moderate heat until light golden but do
not brown. Add the paprika, salt, cayenne, water, and tomatoes, then simmer
for 30 minutes over low heat.
With a wooden spoon, beat the soup until the bread disintegrates. While
beating, add the eggs. Simmer for a few moments but do not boil. The soup
should be highly seasoned. If necessary, add more cayenne and salt.
Garnish with parsley and serve.

Here's yet another garlic soup recipe. This one from Elizabeth David's
*French Country Cooking*.

Soupe A L'Ail

This version is from Languedoc.
Put 2 tablespoons of goose or other good dripping into a deep earthenware
casserole. In this, gently melt 24 cloves of garlic without letting them
brown. (Note, most of us don't have goose fat or an earthenware casserole.
I usually have some schmaltz - rendered chicken fat - on hand, or use a
mixture of butter and olive oil. Use an enameled soup pot.)
Over this pour 3 to 4 pints of warmed stock or water. Season with salt,
black pepper, nutmeg and mace. Cook for 15 minutes. Put the soup through a
sieve. (By this, I think you mush the garlic cloves through.) Return the
soup to the pot to reheat it.
In a bowl, beat the yolks of three to four eggs with three tablespoons of
olive oil. Stir some of the soup into the eggs, then pour the egg mixture
back into the soup without letting it boil again.
Have some slices of stale bread, toasted in the oven with the egg whites
(not beaten) spread over them. Put these bread slices into a soup dish and
pour the soup over them.
Should serve 4 to 6 easily. Enjoy.

2.18.1 Growing thyme
-----
From: skifast123@aol.com (SkiFast123)
Transplanting thyme: a suggestion made by Adelma Grenier Simmons (of
Caprilands, CT fame) in one of her many herb pamphlets is to bury one-half
of the plant along with the roots in the soil. In other words, you will
only, after transplanting, be able to see 1/2 of the plant that you had
formerly. The other 1/2 will be underground.

Since thyme is tricky to transplant because its roots are so fine and in my
experience easy to sever from the main plant, this method has worked with
good results for me.

From: stoddard@aruba.ccit.arizona.edu (Mari J Stoddard)
Scissor off the top third of the leaves, [dry] and use in tea or potpourri.
Do this whenever you have lots of points sticking up, rather than harvested
edges. I love to mix it with mint and Texas Ranger (all three fresh off the
plant). Supposed to be good for throat complaints (cough, soreness). Rose
petals or hibiscus makes for a prettier color.

Cut off a clump to ground level, use bottom third in cooking - sliced fine
or diced. Traditionally boiled in soups or sauces. For instance, lemon
grass clump, chicken broth, coconut milk, garlic and a bit of fish sauce
makes a great soup. Wait till you have at least three clumps.

Cut off a clump almost to ground level and lay on the BBQ grill under fish
or poultry. I usually separate the clump vertically into 1/4- 1/2 inch
diameter lengths and grill them for about a minute before putting down the
fish.

Separate the pot contents into clumps, and plant each clump in a new pot.

From: Christopher Loffredo <cloffred@umabnet.ab.umd.edu>
Either start by trimming off some of the older blades every few weeks,
leaving some young shoots on the plant, then (1) roll up each blade into a
tight curl or tie it into a bow and freeze it at once inside a plastic bag,
or (2) dry the leaves, chop them up, and store in jars.

If you use the freezer method all you have to do is thaw the lemon grass
and it's ready to use. Dried lemon grass needs to be softened up if you're
going to cook with it, so place some in a small bowl with a few tablespoons
of hot water and let it soak for a while before cooking.

Lemon Grass Crockpot Chicken & Thai soup from the leftover stock

1 whole chicken
8 young lemongrass stalks, 4-6" long (use the tender white parts from the
base of young shoots. These are tastiest)
salt and pepper to taste

Rinse the chicken and pat dry. Rub all over with butter and then salt and
pepper to taste. Stuff about half the lemongrass stalks in the cavity of
the chicken and put it in a crockpot, or Dutch oven. Make slits in the skin
and insert the other stalks. Trim if necessary to fit these in. Pour water
over the chicken to submerge it about halfway and cook on low 6-8 hrs till
tender.
Now, you can eat the chicken and make Thai soup out of the lemon grass
stock. To make the soup, strain all the stuff out of the stock. Add a can
of coconut milk, several shakes of red pepper flakes, bits of leftover
chicken that you've shredded and then salt and pepper to taste. Heat
thoroughly & in the last five minutes of cooking time add some sliced
mushrooms, & green onions. Yum.

Other ideas:

Make lemongrass tea. I never measure, just pour boiling water over the
leaves or stems and steep till it's well-colored. Add honey to taste.

Use the tender young shoots, chopped in stir fry dishes to add flavor. It's
good with stir fried chicken, water chestnuts, sliced carrots and broccoli.
I usually stir fry the lemongrass shoots first (about an hour ahead of
time) in a little oil then mix with teriyaki or soy sauce, some ginger, and
cornstarch to thicken. Then, after stir-frying the rest of the stuff, dump
the sauce over all and allow it to thicken. Serve with rice.

2 1/2 c rice
1 1/2 c coconut milk
3 c water
2 1/2 tsp. turmeric
1 tsp. salt
1 sl galangal, dry
1 bay leaf
1 krapau leaf

Once reserved for religious ceremonies, nasi kuneng is still served on
special occasions in Indonesia. This sweet and aromatic centerpiece of a
dish is perfect with satay.

Cut lemon grass into pieces about 3" long and tie into a bundle. In a
3-quart pan combine lemon grass, rice, coconut milk, water, turmeric, salt,
galangal, bay leaf, and citrus leaf. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring gently every now
and then, just until liquid is absorbed. To finish cooking, steam according
to one of the methods listed below.

To steam in cooking pan: cover pan, reduce heat to low, and cook until rice
is tender (15-20 minutes). Halfway thru estimated cooking time, gently
fluff rice with 2 forks. Remove and discard seasonings. Transfer to a
serving bowl or mound rice on a platter into a rounded cone.

To steam using traditional method: transfer rice and seasonings to a
colander or steamer basket insert. Into a large kettle, pour water to a
depth or 1 1/2 inches: bring to boil over high heat. Place colander in
kettle. Cover and reduce heat, steam until rice is tender (about 20
minutes). Remove and discard seasonings. Serve as noted above.

2.19.4 Which lemon grass do you have?

>>A friend told me he was buying small lemon grass plants to put in his
garden to help keep away bugs.
>>Has anyone ever heard of lemon grass as a bug (I assume he meant, gnats,
etc.) deterrent?
>Perhaps there is a connection to citronella?

From Rastapoodle@newsguy.com (Rastapoodle):
Boy, are we confused here folks, but it is a common mistake. Here's the
story: Lemongrass, a delightful plant, and it's close cousin, Citronella
have many wonderful properties, releasing their scent into the air not
being one of them.

Lemongrass is wonderful to eat, Citronella is *not*. They look similar, so
be careful what you buy. Citronella is distilled to extract its oil, which
is used in insect repellent candles, burning coils, etc.

Very interestingly, a Dutch plant scientist did some genetic engineering
and spliced the oil gene of the Citronella into a Pelargonium (scented
geranium) plant. The resultant plant looks like a scented geranium, but
gives off the fragrance of Citronella (and rose, the original scent of the
geranium) to the air with just a breeze or a kiss from the sun.

The hybrid is called Citrosa, and it is patented (you can't make cuttings
for sale). A fully grown Citrosa (about 4 x 4 feet here in Miami) is
supposed to protect a 100 sq. ft area from mosquitoes.

Hope this clears up any confusion.

Anya

PS I have planted my Citrosa among my Lemongrass for an ironic statement.

>I would like to know if it is worth while to grow citronella plants with
the idea that I can make citronella candles. I don't believe I have seen
these plants in any of my order catalogs and none of my gardening books
tell how you get the citronella out of the plants.

From: adgrant@water.waterw.com (Andrew Grant):
Commercially the oil is extracted by steam distillation using old extracted
plants as fuel. I doubt that you want to get that elaborate. I have never
tried it but I suspect that the plants could be chopped up and extracted
with a solvent like alcohol or toluene. Of course you would then have to
boil off the solvent. If you do contemplate this, know that the % oil in
the plant is low (I have forgotten the number) so your yield will be low.

Incidentally the notion that citronella discourages mosquitoes is not well
supported by my experience. I have seen mosquito larvae in rain water on
top of drums of citronella oil with oil droplets in the water!!!

With this plant, the problem is less how to get it to grow and more how to
get rid of it later. To illustrate:

From: david bennett <dabennet@mailbox.syr.edu>
I need some help; how do I get rid of horseradish which I planted a number
of years ago that now threatens to take over my garden? Key issue is no
matter how deep you dig; you never get all of the root out. Now there hides
beneath the soil an infant root waiting to become a big plant next year,
etc.

-----
From eberts@donald.uoregon.edu (sonny hays-eberts), to above:
Learn to appreciate horseradish - I doubt you'll be able to eradicate it
short of using some harsh chemical means. you'll very likely have to settle
for control instead of removal.

If your soil is not heavy clay, I'd recommend spading up the area and using
a sieve to extract as many runners as possible. depending on the area of
your problem, that may be some work.

You can also pinch off all the leaves (continuously) in an effort to
deplete the roots of energy.

You may also have some luck by using a large sheet of black plastic to
mulch the area, though I'd not recommend this in times of extreme heat, it
tends to bake the soil pretty badly.

Another method used to contain such invasive plants is to ring the area
with some sort of buried edging; I know of people who cut the bottoms off
five gallon plastic buckets, bury them and plant the horseradish in the
center of each bucket (the bottom is removed for drainage).

While it's too late to do that, you may be able to define an area, trench
it, and bury a foot or two of something (metal will corrode eventually,
wood will rot, plastic isn't very organic and eventually becomes brittle,
all end up needing to be replaced over time) to restrict underground
movement.

From: rcook@BIX.com (Rick Cook)
First get a gas mask . . .

Seriously, the root is incredibly pungent when you're grinding it. You can
simply peel and grate it and use as is, or you can mix with mustard,
vinegar, cream, etc. for various sauces.

A word of warning: Proceed slowly. Fresh horseradish is a lot hotter than
the stuff you get in bottles.

-----
From: CAOwens@ix.netcom.com (Christine A. Owens )
Dig up the root. Wash carefully, and peel like a carrot. Grate very fine.
Add 1 T cider vinegar and a pinch of salt per 1/2 c. Store frozen, or in
the refrigerator.

You can add a couple of ounces of grated horseradish to vinegar, and let it
sit for a couple of weeks to produce a spiced vinegar with a real 'zip'. A
small amount of grated horseradish added to any dressing or sauce will pep
it up effectively. Mix powdered mustard, the vinegar of your choice, and
grated horseradish in equal volumes for the best mustard in the world.

BTW, horseradish greens are also very good, either diced very fine as an
addition to a salad, steamed like spinach, or sauteed in a little butter or
oil.

2.21.1 Growing fennel
-----
From: Sonny Hays-Eberts <eberts@oregon.uoregon.edu>:
Fennel is easy to grow, growing wild in many areas. An annual, it looks
like dill, only slightly more coarse. I've had problems in wet years with
it getting some sort of mold, but is generally quite troublefree. It
prefers full sun and well-drained soil. Seeds can be planted as soon as
frost danger is past. It's best to blanch (cover with dirt) the bulbs if
you plan on harvesting them to keep them tender. Plants should be thinned
to about a foot apart. You should get some volunteers if you let them go to
seed.

=====
2.21.2 Harvesting fennel
-----
From: Sonny Hays-Eberts <eberts@oregon.uoregon.edu>:
The tender leaves may be diced and used to add a hint of licorice flavor
and is great to use with seafood. Fennel seed can be used with poppy seed,
sesame seed, celery or dill seed on bread. The bulb of the plant is also
commonly harvested, though I always let mine go to seed instead. For best
flavor harvest the leaves just as the flowers are starting to bloom.

-----
> Can anyone give me some ideas on how to store or prepare the surplus of
fennel seeds in my yard?

From: HerbalMuse@aol.com
If you intend to use the seeds in baking or other cooking, then you must
collect them from the flower heads as soon as they begin to turn brown, or
they will fall to the ground to re-seed. I store whole dill seed heads (as
you can do with fennel) in paper bags and keep them in a cool, dry pantry
in the basement. Fennel seeds are excellent with grilled or broiled fish,
chicken, with tomato based soups, and of course, in breads, cakes &
cookies.

If the seeds have already fallen to the ground, and are not cleared away,
you can expect to see the emergence of new plants in early spring. This may
delight you, however you should consider where these plants will grow in
relation to the rest of garden. Fennel should be grown in a bed of it's own
since most herbs won't do well in its presence, and it will stunt tomatoes
and bush beans.

=====
2.21.3 Using / preserving fennel
-----
From: Sonny Hays-Eberts <eberts@oregon.uoregon.edu>:
The leaves and seeds may be dried. The leaves may also be frozen. The
tastiest way I've had it is from a local restaurant, Ambrosia. A dish
called fettucine Gamberi, it had fettucine (duh!) in a parmesan cream sauce
with garlic, fennel leaves, parsley, scallops, shrimp, capers and fresh
tomatoes. Quite tasty! Fennel has an anise or licorice flavor, and can be
used to flavor cheeses, vegetables and some pastries in addition to
seafood.

=====
2.21.4 Which Fennel do you have?
-----
From: Sonny Hays-Eberts <eberts@oregon.uoregon.edu>:
There are two common types of fennel; Bronze Fennel and Common Fennel also
known as Finocchio (or Florence Fennel). True to it's name, the Bronze
Fennel's foliage is a dusky brown. My experience has all been with bronze
fennel, which is pretty in the garden as well as useful for cooking.

2.23.1 Growing parsley
-----
From: Linda Kovacs (kovacsla@vnet.ibm.com)
Parsley is a biennial. Plant seeds early in the spring (they're a little
slow to germinate). The first year, you get plenty of leaves, on fairly
long stems that come from the crown of the plant. The second year, you get
a couple of leaves and a long bloom stalk, which looks very much like Queen
Anne's Lace (they're related.) If you let it go to seed, some of the seed
will grow the next year.

To have a steady supply of parsley for cooking, you should plant two years
in a row. After that, it will self-sow if you let it.

Parsley's easy to grow - reasonable soil, sun, and water if you have a long
dry spell. The only pest I ever had was leaf miners, and the damage was
minimal.

of leaves, and no more will grow, because the plant is working on bloom and
seeds.

2.23.2 Using/preserving parsley
-----
From: Linda Kovacs (kovacsla@vnet.ibm.com)
The flat "Italian" parsley is the most strongly flavored. If you're going
to use it for cooking, this is the kind to get. Curly parsley is much
prettier on a plate, but doesn't have as much flavor. Use it mostly for
garnishes.

Parsley is, of course, a classic garnish. A sprig of curly parsley on a
plate really dresses it up. You can also chop parsley and sprinkle it on
meats, vegetables, etc.

Parsley is also a classic soup herb. When you're making stock, parsley is
one of the "aromatic vegetables" that's recommended to make the flavor
richer. For this, use stem and all; in fact, this is a good place to use
stems that you've cut off from pieces used for garnish.

It's a wonderful addition to a cooked vegetable, especially green beans or
peas. Tends to accentuate the flavor of the vegetable.

It's good in salads, too, adding a different "green" texture and flavor.
It's a bit too strong to be used by itself, for most people's taste.

Parsley can be chopped and dried, or chopped and frozen in ice cubes. The
cubes are great added to soup or a sauce. The dried parsley can be added as
is to a dish to be cooked or used as a garnish on soup, or soaked in a
little bit of water and sprinkled on top of already- cooked food as a
garnish.

2.24 Monarda or Bee Balm

Latin name: Monarda didyma and other Monarda species.
=====
2.24.1 Growing Monarda
-----
From: jnewbo@aol.com (Jnewbo)
My Monarda Cambridge Scarlet (the most common one) doesn't stay in place;
it moves forward on flat stems near the surface. That means it creeps
forward and needs to be divided and resituated every two-three years or so.
It also is prone to mildew - but the crown-like scarlet blooms are
fabulous.

A more well-behaved variety is the pink one, "Croftway Pink"; it has more
lanceolate leaves and smaller blooms, but the bees (including
hummingbird-moth) love it, and it enlarges in the more traditional way,
increasing the clump rather than traveling all over the garden.

Both bloom about three weeks, maybe more (sometimes I get "double" and even
"triple decker" crowns on the red one). After that clip back and you may
get more smaller blooms after a while.

-----
From: Tristan Hatton-Ellis <Tristan.Hatton-Ellis@bris.ac.uk>
Both 'Croftway Pink' and Cambridge Scarlet are rather mildew-prone. You may
be interested to know that there are a whole range of new hybrids that have
come out, bearing the names of the signs of the zodiac, that are much more
mildew-resistant. They come in colours from purple through red and pink to
white.

Monardas are also much less prone to getting mildew (and also grow and
flower much better) in a dampish soil, or at least in a place where they do
not get too dry in summer.

-----
an354@FreeNet.Carleton.CA (Barbara)
Monarda didyma, also known as Bergamot and Bee Balm is a hardy perennial
which grows 2-3 feet tall. Bees love it.

The plant spreads fairly quickly through its root system. Divide every
three years, discarding the dead centre of the root. The plant will grow
well in sun or part shade. The flowers last 4-6 weeks.

From: an354@FreeNet.Carleton.CA (Barbara)
Monarda didyma, Bergamot or Bee Balm: The leaves dry well and can be used
to make a tea that tastes like Earl Grey tea.

From: jnewbo@aol.com (Jnewbo)
The leaves and flowers of Cambridge scarlet are marvelous,
bergamotty-flavored things, though I found the tea rather scratchy on the
throat.

From: Marylin.Kraker@bbs.c4systm.com (Marylin Kraker)
Mondarda does make good tea, which is why it's also called Oswego tea. It's
not the same as the bergamot in Earl Grey, which is a tropical citrus.

From: Conrad Richter <conrad@richters.com>
Both the leaves and flowers can be used. The flowers, of course, add nice
colour. Some say that the flowers have a more delicate flavour, and of the
various varieties, the red bergamot is the creme-de-la-creme.

=====
2.24.5 Monarda and the bergamot flavor in Earl Grey tea
-----
>So I heard from someone that bee balm is sorta-kinda the same plant that
gives Earl Grey tea its distintive taste. Is this true?

From HeK@hetta.pp.fi:
No, it isn't. The flavor in Earl grey tea comes from the bergamot orange,
Citrus aurantia var. bergamia. Monarda just has the same flavor, so you
-can- make your own Earl grey tea using Monarda leaves. Storebought Earl
grey uses abovementioned citrus.

From: Eve Dexter (evedex@hookup.net)
Scrape and cut into 1/4 inch slices enough non-fibrous young Ginger root to
make 1 quart. Put the slices into a large non-aluminum pat and cover
generously with water. Bring slowly to the boil an simmer, covered until
tender (20 min). Add 1 cup sugar and stir until the mixture boils. Remove
from heat.
Cover and let stand overnight at room temperature.
Recook, simmering gently for about 15 min (after coming to the boil). Add 1
seeded sliced lemon and 1 cup light corn syrup. Uncover and simmer 15
minutes longer, stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat and let stand covered overnight.
Bring the mixture to the boil again and add 1 cup sugar and simmer for 30
min STIRRING CONSTANTLY (burns easily). Add 1 cup sugar, bring back to the
boil and remove from heat.
Cover and let stand overnight again.
In the fourth cooking, bring the mixture to a boil once more. When the
syrup drops heavily from the side of a spoon, and the ginger is
translucent, pour the mixture into sterile jars and seal. This yields about
5 cups.
If you want Candied ginger...drain the ginger after the last cooking.
Reserve the syrup for flavoring sauces and allow the slices to dry on a
sheet or better still a rack, overnight. When well dried, roll in
granulated sugar and store in tightly covered glass jars.

Sweet but tasty.

Slivered macadamia nuts or almonds may be sprinkled on after the fish comes

From: jdtrach@islandnet.com (Julia Trachsel)

This is a great recipes which I always make in our cool, rainy season out
here on the west coast. Hope you enjoy it as much as my family and guests
do.

Gingerbread

1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg beaten
1 cup molasses
2 1/2 cups flour
1 1/2 teas. baking soda
1 tbsp. ginger
1 tsp. allspice
1 tsp. cloves
1 cup boiling water
1 cup raisins (optional)
1 cup crystalized ginger, chopped

Cream shortening, sugar, add beaten egg and molasses. Add dry ingredients.
Add boiling water, mix well. Add chopped crystalized ginger and stir
gently. Pour inti 2 small greased loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees for 50-60
minutes. A skewer inserted into the middle should come out clean when the
gingerbread is done.

My personal twist to this recipe is to add 1 cup of crystalized ginger
(instead of 1/2 cup) and to serve it with hot lemon pie filling which has
been extended by adding enough extra water to make it pourable.

2.26 Anise

Latin name:
Pimpinella anisum - this is aniseed, and that's the plant covered here.
Illicium anisatum (I.verum) - this is star anise.
=====
2.26.1 Growing anise
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Anise is an annual herb native to the Mediterranean- Egypt, Greece, Crete,
and Asia Minor. It is a rather fussy herb; it likes perfect weather of
uniform rainfall and temperatures. It wilts under excessive heat but
requires full sun, and it does not transplant well.

Propagation is by seed, and be sure the seed is fresh. Seeds need a
temperature of 70F to germinate, and will germinate in 7 to 14 days. Sow
1/4 to 1/2 inch deep in light, well-drained, medium-rich sandy soil. A pH
of 6.0 to 7.5 is best. Space 3 inch seedlings 6 to 12 inches apart.

=====
2.26.2 Harvesting anise
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Harvest seeds as soon as the tip of the seed turns gray (they should not be
black), anywhere from 60 to 130 days after planting, depending on climate.
Since Anise is an annual, collect seeds either by pulling up the entire
plant, or by just cutting the tops off. Spread plants to dry. Thresh.

=====
2.26.3 Using / preserving anise
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Use fresh leaves as a garnish or flavoring for salads. They can be cooked
as a pot-herb.
Flowers are occasionally dried and powdered as a flavoring for wine.
Seeds are used in bread, pastries, cookies, vegetables, baked apples,
applesauce, cheese, desserts, plum jam, brandy, cordials, and milk. 1/2 to
1 tsp per 4 quarts of potato or lentil soup, 1/2 tsp crushed in salads.
Use ground anise seed quickly, it loses its strength fast.

2.27 Borage

Latin name: Borago officinalis
=====
2.27.1 Growing borage
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Borage is a very hardy annual native to the Mediterranean. It grows to 2
feet tall, or even 5 feet in rich soil, and has beautiful blue flowers. It
is an extremely tolerant plant, doing well in average and poor dry soils
(pH between 5 and 8), but it is difficult to transplant due to its tap
root. It is a good plant for container culture, planted in a large tub with
smaller herbs arranged around the edge.

Borage is easily grown from seed. Plant 1/2 in. deep (about the time of the
last frost outdoors), seeds will germinate in 7 to 14 days. Plant in full
sun or partial shade, thin 18 in. to 2 feet apart. To encourage leaf
growth, supply rich moist soil. To encourage flowers, hold the fertilizer
and give plenty of sun.

Leaves give off sparks and pop when burned due to nitrate of potash.

=====
2.27.3 Using / preserving borage
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Fresh leaves are best, but can be dried. Harvest leaves for drying as plant
begins to flower. Dry very carefully - quickly, good air circulation, and
with no overlapping of leaves. Flowers can be dried to add color to
potpourri.

Fresh leaves and flowers have a spicy, cucumber-like taste and an
onion-like smell. Young leaves or peeled stems are good chopped in salads,
or leaves can be boiled as a pot-herb. The flowers make a colorful addition
to salads and a flavorful addition to lemonade. Add borage to cabbage-type
vegetables, gravies, or spiced punches. In some areas of France, the
flowers are dipped in batter and fried. Flowers can also be candied.

Borage Flower Tea: handful of fresh leaves steeped in 1-2 quarts of water,
add one or two sprigs of spearmint. Makes a refreshing summer beverage.

Borage and Rosemary Wine: Steep a handful of fresh rosemary (or 2
tablespoons dried rosemary) and 2 tablespoons dried borage leaves in one
bottle of white wine for a week or more. Strain through cheesecloth or a
paper coffee strainer.

Candied Borage Flowers: Brush flowers with lightly beaten egg white, then
dip in superfine granulated sugar. Spread to dry.

-----
From: Pat Peck <arpeck@FREENET.SCRI.FSU.EDU>

Borage vinegar

1 1/2 cups fresh borage flowers (I add a little of the stem and leaves for
more intense flavor), wash and blot dry.
4 cups white wine vinegar (do not use distilled white vinegar)

Place in large jar. (I use mason jars with plastic over jar lip under lid).
Heat vinegar to just before boil. Pour into jar. Stir. Place in dark place
for 3 to 4 weeks. Go by and stir from time to time.

P.S. You can cheat and add a tiny drop of blue food coloring if not blue
enough.

2.28 Horehound

Latin name: Marrubium vulgare
=====
2.28.1 Growing horehound
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Horehound is a perennial native to the Mediterranean and northern Europe,
and is naturalized in the United States. It is a good border plant and
doesn't require much attention, but is sometimes winter-killed.

Horehound prefers a poor, dry sandy soil, and tolerates a wide pH range-
all the way from 4.5 to 8.

Horehound is easily grown from seed sown in shallow holes in fall or early
spring. It can also be propagated from stem cuttings, root divisions, or
layering. Space seedlings 8 to 15 inches apart.

=====
2.28.2 Harvesting horehound
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Horehound flowers from June to September, but not always in its first year
as plants that are grown from seed may take two years to bloom. Harvest the
leaves and flowering tops in peak bloom, they are easy to dry, or can be
used fresh.

=====
2.28.3 Using / preserving horehound
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Horehound tea, cough syrup and candy: (Dried leaves may be used for tea.)
Strip leaves from plant, chop into measuring cup. Measure out twice as much
water as leaves. Bring water alone to boil, then add horehound. Boil for
five minutes, let cool, and strain into jars. Refrigerate resulting
infusion until needed.

To make tea: Add twice as much boiling water as horehound infusion. Sweeten
to taste.
To make syrup: Add twice as much honey as horehound infusion and a little
lemon juice.
To make candy: Add twice as much sugar as horehound infusion, and add about
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar per cup of infusion. Stir to dissolve, and
cook over low heat until the hard ball stage (290F) is reached. Pour into
buttered plate. Break into pieces when cool.

Old-Time Horehound Candy

From: Fran <frich@TENET.EDU>: from _Herbal Treasures_ by Phyllis V. Shaudys

1 tsp. butter
1 tsp. lemon juice (or 1 sprig lemon balm)

In large saucepan, cover horehound with water. Bring to boil, simmer 10
min. Strain thru cheesecloth and allow tea to settle. Ladle 2 cups
horehound tea into large kettle. Add brown sugar, corn syrup, cream of
tartar. Boil, stirring often, until mixture reaches 240F. Add butter.
Continue to boil until candy reaches 300F (hard crack). R4move from heat,
add lemon juice. Pour at once into buttered 8" square pan. As candy cools,
score into squares. Remove from pan as soon as it is cool. Store in
aluminum foil or ziplock plastic bags.

2.29 Marjoram and oregano

Latin names:

The genera of Origanum sp. are subject to frequent changes ... like with
Mentha, the botanists can't seem to make up their minds.
The 'marjoram' mentioned below is Origanum majorana. The rest are lumped
together under 'oregano'.

Sweet Marjoram: Origanum majorana (former: Majorana hortensis)
Oregano or Wild Marjoram: Origanum vulgare
Pot Marjoram: Origanum onites
Winter marjoram: Origanum heracleoticum
Dittany of Crete, hop marjoram: Origanum dictamnus

Also see 2.29.4, Mexican oregano and 2.29.4, Cuban oregano.

=====
2.29.1 Growing marjoram and oregano
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Marjoram grows as an annual up to two feet tall in most parts of the United
States due to climate, but it is a perennial in its native north Africa,
Portugal, and southwest Asia.

Marjoram prefers a light, fairly rich, well-drained, slightly alkaline
soil, with a pH from 7 to 8. It like full sun.

Marjoram is easily grown from seed that is sown in spring, or by cuttings
taken in the summer. It can be induced to be perennial by overwintering
indoors in pots. When grown indoors it has a tendency to trail that makes
it good for hanging baskets. Marjoram makes a good companion plant for
eggplant, pumpkin and zucchini.

The genus Origanum contains about 20 species, of which five are common in
herb gardens. Oregano (O. vulgare) is a perennial, native to Asia, Europe,
and northern Africa. Pot marjoram (O. onites) is a close relative of sweet
marjoram that is native to the Mediterranean, and O. heracleoticum is
native to southeast Europe.

Oregano grows to 2.5 feet tall, and flowers from late July until September.
It is a sprawling herb and is therefore not well suited for growing
indoors. Pot marjoram grows to two feet tall, and neither it nor dittany of
Crete are hardy in cold climates. Dittany of Crete grows to one foot tall,
blooms in summer or autumn, and like Pot marjoram, grows as an annual in
cold climates. Dittany of Crete grows well indoors due to its small size
and its flavor is very similar to that of common oregano.

Oregano likes light, well-drained, slightly alkaline soil with full sun.
Rich, moist soil makes the aroma and flavor of oregano weak.

Oregano can be grown from seeds, stem cuttings, or root divisions, but
seeds are sometimes slow to germinate. Also, plants grown from seed may not
be true to the flavor of the parent plant, or may even be flavorless.
Oregano makes a good companion plant for cauliflower but should not be
planted with broccoli or cabbage.

=====
2.29.2 Harvesting marjoram and oregano
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Marjoram: harvest the leaves as soon as blooming begins. They dry easily
and can be frozen, but some people believe that drying the leaves actually
improves the flavor, making it sweeter and more aromatic. Its flavor when
fresh is closer to that of oregano.

Harvest oregano leaves as plants begin to bloom.

=====
2.29.3 Using / preserving marjoram and oregano
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Marjoram is great in tomato dishes, and with meats, onions, brussel
sprouts, or mushrooms.

Oregano is good with potato salad, fowl stuffing, peas, soups, scrambled
eggs, omelets, tomato dishes, meats, beans, deviled eggs, spaghetti, chili,
hamburgers and pizza. It is essential to Italian, Spanish, and Mexican
dishes, and combines well with basil.

Chicken Corn Soup with marjoram

2 cups chicken stock
2 cups chopped potatoes
2 cups fresh corn kernels
2 cups chopped cooked chicken
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh marjoram
salt and pepper

Bring stock to a boil, add potatoes, cover, cook until potatoes are barely
tender. Add corn and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and marjoram, add
salt and pepper to taste. Cook for about another 10 minutes.

=====
2.29.4 Which oregano do you have?
-----
From: Chris McElrath <Mcmariah@AOL.COM>:
The word oregano comes from the Greek "oro" meaning mountain and "ganos"
meaning joy. The generic stuff that nurseries sell is Origanum vulgare
which is attractive, but of little culinary value. Many of you may have
noticed that your oregano plants don't have much flavor. True greek oregano
is the same as what is often called wild marjoram. In fact, I usually use
marjoram in place of oregano in my recipes. Many nurseries interchange the
labels freely. Greeks felt that the sweet smell was created by Aphrodite as
a symbol of happiness. Bridal couples were crowned with it and it was
placed on tombs to give peace to the departed.
O. vulgare -- basic oregano, spreads by rhizomes, grows wild in England
O. onites is an upright plant -- called pot marjoram
O. heracleoticum -- winter marjoram, peppery and volatile flavor

Cuban oregano:

>Someone just told me they purchased "cuban oregano" they wanted to know
more about this intriguing plant. Apparently it is a succulent and has a
very strong oregano flavor. He thought it was a strange plant and is
reluctant to use it for culinary purposes.
>If anyone has more info on this plant or knows where it can be purchased I
would appreciate the info.

From: Ann McCormick <McCORMICK9@AOL.COM>
>I have recently purchased some Cuban oregano, with botanical name of
"Coleus ambonicus". It has thick, almost fleshy leaves that are 1 to 2
inches long with a somewhat fuzzy surface. It has a wonderful fragrance
that reminds me of oregano with a kick.
>The garden shop owner told me she knew very little about it other that
some of her customers use it in cooking and that it is should be grown like
an annual here (Zone 6, Central New Jersey). From the botanical name (and
its appearance) it is obviously not a true oregano. Have any of you grown
this plant? Any information would be appreciated.
From: Rastapoodle@newsguy.com (Rastapoodle)
It is Plectranthus, a tropical substitute for Oregano. It is totally safe,
and very pungent, so a little goes a long way. Richters Herb in Canada
should sell it. Here in Miami, it's almost a weed, as all of the Caribbean
and Latin American residents treasure it. It grows easily from cuttings,
prefers sun/semi-shade during the hottest part of the day.

From: weed <avril_tolley@berlex.com>
I don't know where you would get it in New York, Steve. Here in Northern
California, it is sold in the herb section, usually in 4-inch pots. It's
hairy, which is why I think you wouldn't want to use it in cooking. It's
very pungent, though, great smell. There are enough good oreganos for
cooking, I like to leave the really ornamental ones for growing. This plant
needs *excellent* drainage, full sun and not too much water or it will bite
the dust. I have one growing in a pot, and one growing in an old sandbox
I'm turning into a rock garden. You can just break off a stem and put it in
a pot for a new plant. I've given lots of them to people. I would bet that
it's tender, and you'd have to bring it indoors in winter (we don't get
cold enough here for me to find out). I had one growing on the bright, hot
windowsill in my kitchen for a long time before planting it out, so that
works, too.

From: mouvedre@ix.netcom.com (BETH W SPROW)
Cuban oregano is an excellent plant. I've used it in cooking and it is
wonderful. Especially in salsas with tomatillos, tomatoes peppers etc.
As a house plant its great. It needs practically no watering and its
varigated with cream around the edge of creamy green leaves.

From: ae@meer.net (Arthur Evans)
Here's one shot in the dark ... In The Art of Mexican Cooking, Diana
Kennedy describes the various kinds of oregano used in regional Mexican
cooking (there are apparently at least 13 kinds), including the following:
"There is [...] a large, juicy-leaved oregano grown and used fresh in the
Yucatan Peninsula and Tabasco, mostly with fish. It is Coleus amboinicus (I
have also seen it growing in Hawaii) and it is referred to in Tabasco as
oreganon."
Juicy-leaved could mean succulent, and something that grows in the Yucatan
might well grow in Cuba ...

Mexican Oregano:

From: Chris McElrath <Mcmariah@AOL.COM>
Mexican oregano is a general name for several plants, all of which have a
strong oregano flavor: Poliomintha longiflora, Lippia graveolens, and
Monarda fistulosa var. menthifolia. These are probably the most common but
there are others.
So, it comes down to: Mexican oregano is a common name which is used for
several different species that grow in the southwestern US and Mexico. If
you can find one, it probably has more flavor than the ubiquitous O.
vulgare.

2.30 Caraway

Latin name: Carum carvi
=====
2.30.1 Growing caraway
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Caraway is a hardy biennial native to Europe and western Asia. It grows to
2 1/2 ft. tall. Caraway like full sun, and does well in dry heavy clay soil
that has a moderate amount of humus (pH between 6 and 7.5). It doesn't like
having its roots disturbed.

Caraway is easily grown from seed that is sown in either early spring or in
the fall. Seeds planted in September will flower and produce seed the
following summer. It occasionally matures in the third summer of growth.

Plant seeds 1/4 to 1/2 in. deep, they will germinate in 7 to 21 days, or
more. Space seedlings 12 to 24 in. apart.

=====
2.30.2 Harvesting caraway
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Harvest seeds as soon as they begin to ripen to avoid shattering of the
fruits. They ripen from June to August of the second year.

=====
2.30.3 Using / preserving caraway
-----
From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Roots taste like a combination of parsnips and carrots, and they can be
boiled like a vegetable.
Young shoots and leaves can be cooked with other vegetables or can be
chopped into salads.
The dry seeds are used in rye bread, sauerkraut, cheeses, applesauce,
soups, salad dressings, apple pie, cabbage dishes, potatoes, and stew.
Seeds contain small amounts of protein and vitamin B.

2.31 Catnip

Latin name: Nepeta cataria, Nepeta mussinii
=====
2.31.1 Growing catnip
-----
From snielsen@orednet.org (Susan L. Nielsen):
To all catnip culture hopefuls... my own tale of woe.

I guess the point was mainly to grow it for the cats, but I had anticipated
waiting until the holidays and using it for gifts.

The first time, I naively plunked the catnip among the mints and
pennyroyals. The poor little transplant never pushed its roots out from the
pot-shaped ball they came in. The neighbor cats ripped it out of the ground
and played football with it all afternoon -- this I judge from its
condition when I arrived home from work the second evening.

Silly me, I thought then that a bit of wire would keep the cats off it. I
tenderly re-planted the invalid Nepeta with a bit of poultry wire arranged
over the top and staked into the soil. I have always wondered what happened
to the wire...

After this second violation, the plant did not look a likely candidate for
survival. In medical terms, its condition was 'grave.'

So I brought home another, and planted it in the top of a _large_, heavy
imported Italian terra cotta pot. Filled with soil, this pot weighs in at
about 75 pounds. Imagine my horror, when I returned home the following
evening, to find the pot overturned, the soil excavated, the catnip plant
nowhere to be found, but significant tufts of animal fur scattered among
the wreckage. It passed through my mind that this might not be an ordinary
cat at work, but, perhaps, Something Larger? The yellow tiger-colored hairs
did, however, suggest a domestic visitor over an apricot catamount.

I next (jaw set, grim determination in my eye) planted catnip in a plastic
pot hung by 3 chains from the cross-bar of the clothesline. With pliars I
closed the hook that passed through the eye of the bar. I arranged new
chicken wire over the top of the pot. I put cast-off barbed wire at the
base of the clothesline pole, and anchored it with iron stakes driven in at
angles. I stood back to admire my work. It looked like an industrial
construction project on the perimeter of a prison.

I have always prided myself on effective design in the garden...

On the following evening, I probably need not tell, the catnip had again
been ravaged. The scene was improbable. The pot, still attached by one of
three chains, hung at a debauched angle. Its contents had spilled into the
barbed wire at the base of the installation.
Among those wires were traces of catnip leaves, and quantities of yellow
and white fur, soft fur, tinged with spots of blood. Bits of perlite from
the potting medium clung to the red spots. The catnip, and the nipped cat,
were nowhere in evidence.

I adopted a philosophical outlook then, as I surveyed the result of the
day's work. I decided it might be a better thing to not grow catnip in the
garden.

Added 22Sep 96: From Judi Burley <jburley@TRIANON.WORLDTEL.COM>:
Regarding Catnip. I use a cage over mine. Just an old birdcage. Then the
cats can get at what grows out of the cage but the base plant is safe. By
the way I put the cage over the plant and then drive the cage into the
ground well. Works great.

From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Catnip is a very hardy perennial that is native to the dry regions of the
Mediterranean, inland Europe, Asia, and Africa. Cataria grows to 4 feet
tall and somewhat resembles stinging nettle. Mussinii grows to 1 foot,
sprawls. It has a citrus-like scent and is sometimes called catmint. In
order to keep cats away from catnip avoid bruising the leaves, which
releases the oils. "If you sow it cats won't know it, if you set it cats
will get it," is an apt saying.

Catnip loves full sun but can tolerate partial shade, and does well in
almost any garden soil (pH between 5 and 7.5). It is more pungent when it
is grown in sandy soil with full sun.

Catnip is easily grown from seed, and can also be propagated from root
division. Plant seeds 1/4 in. deep or shallower, they will usually
germinate promptly. Space seedlings 18 to 24 in. apart, they transplant
fairly happily. (However, transplanting them brings them to the attention
of the felines.) Catnip grows well in pots and windowboxes, and even though
it is a perennial, it may have to be re-planted a couple times a year to
replace those plants ravaged by the cats.

Harvest as needed for fresh leaves. Harvest flowering tops for drying,
usually in July and September.

From Jennifer A. Cabbage <fxjac@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>:
Catnip can be used to add an unusual flavor to sauces, soups and stews.

2.32 Lovage

Latin name:
Lovage: Levisticum officinalis (Ligusticum levisticum)
Scotch lovage: Ligusticum scoticum (this one is commonly called Lovage in
the UK)

=====
2.32.1 Growing lovage
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
This is a broad-leaved, tall (6-10') and (for an umbellifer) long-lived
perennial. It has deep fleshy roots, and prefers deep, well-drained soil
with some moisture in a light but not necessarily sunny position.

It dies down completely in the winter and will survive the top inch or so
of the soil freezing solid. It may be grown from seed, small plants, or by
splitting older ones in its dormant season. It spreads slowly but is not
invasive.

From HeK:
If you give it good soil and plenty of sun it'll go for the height record
in your garden - I've seen plants that were over 3 m (10') high. On the
other hand, in a poor spot it'll only get to about 50 cm (2'). The roots
will be enormous no matter where it grows. You can propagate it from pieces
of root, and it's an 'easy to garden' plant - nothing will crowd it out and
I have yet to see an unhealthy plant.

=====
2.32.2 Harvesting lovage
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
The leaves can be used fresh or dried in the usual way, or the seed can be
harvested for winter use. An established plant produces huge heads of
seeds.

From HeK:
The roots are used in cooking in Europe. Dig them, take a step or two back,
try to dig again. Give up, and at least try to break off a chunk or two.
Dry these in small chunks and powder before use. Caution - very little goes
a long way.
You pick the seeds when they turn brown; dry them and add as a spice to
your foods.
You pick a leaf a year (they have a very strong taste and are -really-
large), dry it and use it as a spice.
You can pick a leaf- or flowerstalk and shoot peas - it's much more fun
than weeding the garden, and you might hit a fly or two, too ;) or you can
use it as a drinking straw.

=====
2.32.3 Using / preserving lovage
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
It has a taste rather like celery with a hint of yeast extract, and is a
traditional flavour enhancer; it can be used in quite large quantities.
The young leaves are excellent chopped in salads, but the normal use is to
put the older leaves or seeds in soups, stews, casseroles, stock etc.
The seeds will keep for a year or two (for cooking) in a tightly closed
jar. It is an extremely useful herb.

From HeK:
It's the main spice in all those dried soups - in Germany it has been
called the Maggi-herb, after one big dried soup firm over there. I add it
to all kinds of stews and soups, and it fits nicely in a spicemix with
ginger, sweet pepper, cayenne, turmeric, garlic powder... sorry, have to go
cook something now. And oh yes, you can also candy young stems of lovage. I
wouldn't vouch for that taste, though. Anyone want to try? Let me know how
many you managed to eat ;)

=====
2.32.4 Which lovage do you have?
-----
From HeK:
Scotch lovage can be used like lovage. Can't say how it differs from
lovage, though, as it doesn't grow here. I imagine the taste is milder -
how else can you explain that the English make a stew out of lovage leaves?

2.33 Savory, Summer and Winter

Latin name:
Summer savory: Satureja hortensis
Winter savory: Satureja montana

=====
2.33.1 Growing savory
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
Summer Savory: This is a medium-sized (1') annual, and needs reasonably
warm, damp conditions for germination, but needs only a little water
thereafter. It has small seeds, so don't sow it too deep. It may be
possible to sow it for succession in warmer climates than the UK, but it
isn't here.
Winter Savory: Treat it exactly as common thyme (thymus vulgaris), which it
closely resembles; however, it is slightly more compact, darker leaved and
has white flowers. Like thyme, it makes a good edging plant.

From: Esther Czekalski <E.Czekalski@MA02Q.BULL.COM>
Summer savory is sometimes called the bean herb because it goes so well
with green beans. It is a much more delicate plant than winter savory and
in my experience, can handle a little more shade. In my zone I can only
grow it as an annual; winter savory will overwinter and stay almost
evergreen if it's mulched a bit.

=====
2.33.2 Harvesting savory
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
Summer Savory: The leaves can be used fresh or dried in the usual way.
Winter Savory: The leaves can be used fresh or dried in the usual way, but
it is evergreen in the UK (again, exactly like thyme).

=====
2.33.3 Using / preserving savory
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
Winter Savory: It has a flavour somewhere between thyme and summer savory,
but is slightly bitter. It can be used as an alternative for either, and
makes an interesting change, but be careful not to use too much. It is
nothing like as bitter as hyssop.
Summer Savory: It has a special affinity for beans and is known as the
"Bohnenkraut" in Germany - adding it to bean salad turns horse food into a
delicacy! It can also be used in salads, and for other flavouring.

From: Esther Czekalski <E.Czekalski@MA02Q.BULL.COM>
I like to get a bite of summer savory in salads, too, lettuce salads,
potato salads, whatever. The leaves are fairly small so I just strip them
from the stem and throw them in; chop them if you don't love herbs as much
as I do. You can use it in soups and things but the flavor is so delicate
that you might not know that you did! It would be better served chopped as
a topping to hot dishes. (Put the winter savory in while it's cooking.)
The winter savory can be kept whole, tied with other herbs and taken out of
the soup before serving.
Has anyone ever used savory for it's smell? I wonder if it wouldn't add a
nice note to a lemony mixture. I just don't know if it lasts. Also, I have
never preserved either variety so can't tell you what works best.

2.34 Rue

Latin name: Ruta graveolens

=====
2.34.1 Growing rue
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
It is a short-lived (c. 5 years) evergreen perennial 1-2' high, and seems
totally indifferent to soil. It takes incredibly easily from cuttings and
responds very well to being hacked back when it gets leggy.
Apparently it can also be grown from seed. Jackman's Blue is the most
decorative variety, and tastes the same as the common green one. It is
hardy in the UK, but I don't know how much frost it will take.

=====
2.34.2 Harvesting rue
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
Don't bother, unless you are Italian!

=====
2.34.3 Using / preserving rue
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
It is extremely bitter, and is used in very small quantities in Roman
(ancient) and Italian cookery - but do experiment, because it really does
add something. There is an Italian liqueur called (surprise!) Ruta, which
has a branch of rue in the bottle, but is too bitter for most foreigners to
drink :-)

From HeK:
It is also considered slightly toxic nowadays. Sensitive people can develop
photosensitivity due to the coumarins in the plant when handling it; these
folks should not ingest it. Otherwise, small amounts not too often should
be OK - but if you can't take it then don't take it.

==========

2.35 Rocket

Latin name: Eruca sativa

=====
2.35.1 Growing Rocket
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
It is a quick-growing annual about 2' high, and even in the UK will produce
seed in well under a growing season. Sow it every few weeks for succession,
and leave one early sowing for seed. It will probably escape, but is not a
pernicious weed. A late sowing will last until the first severe frosts.

=====
2.35.2 Harvesting rocket
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
Use its leaves fresh.

=====
2.35.3 Using / preserving rocket
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
It has a smoky taste, and is used to enliven salads - it gives some flavour
even to supermarket Iceberg lettuce! It is probably the best of the
traditional (but now neglected) salad plants, and is well worth the space
even in a very small garden.

==========

2.36 Angelica

Latin name: Angelica archangelica

=====
2.36.1 Growing Angelica
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
This is a broad-leaved, monocarpic biennial or perennial (i.e. it takes 2-5
years to flower, and then dies) 6-10' high. It likes half shade (to reduce
the grass cover), and damp, rich soil. Given the right environment, it will
self seed and keep itself established. If you have a very hot, dry garden,
don't bother with it. It looks very much like lovage, but smells entirely
different.

From HeK:
If you keep the flowerstalk down (break it off every time you see it
emerge) the plant will be perennial - until it does flower.

=====
2.36.2 Harvesting angelica
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
Cut the side-shoots (which can be quite thick stems) before they become
stringy - this is in May or June in the UK, and is just as the flower heads
start to open. You can also cut the flower shoots off a little earlier,
which will have the effect of keeping the plant alive for a year or so
longer, but it will die after about 5 years anyway.

=====
2.36.3 Using / preserving angelica
-----
Candied angelica stems
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):

Cut the shoots into strips about 6" long and 1/2" wide, and remove untidy
bits. Blanch them (i.e. bring them to the boil and throw away the water).
Then candy them, using gradually increasing strengths of sugar syrup. When
they are done, dry them and keep them, but don't throw away the syrup; it
keeps for at least a year in the refrigerator and for a long time just in a
jar.
They can be used for decoration, in fruit salad, in ice cream and so on.

The syrup can be used for sweetening such things, and adds a strong
angelica taste. I recommend angelica ice cream, made with the chopped
stems, syrup and Chartreuse (an angelica-based liqueur) - this recipe is my
own invention, incidentally, and this is the first publication :-)

The young leaves and stems are also naturally sweet, and can be used in
stewed fruits or other puddings, or used in pot pourris.

Home Candied Angelica
From af961@james.freenet.hamilton.on.ca (Helen Peagram), quoting Philippa
Davenport in "Country Living" (British), May 1987.

1 lb Angelica
1 lb Granulated sugar

The most important thing about candying angelica is to choose stalks that
are young and tender. In other words, angelica is only worth candying in
April or May when the shoots are new and softly coloured. Trim the young
shoots into 3-4 inch lengths, put them into a pan, cover with water and
bring to a boil. Drain and scrape away tough skin and fibrous threads with
a potato peeler, rather as you might prepare celery. Return the angelica to
the pan, pour on fresh boiling water and cook until green and tender. If
the shoots are as youthful as they should be, this will take 5 minutes or
less. Drain the stalks and dry them. Put them into a bowl and sprinkle
granulated sugar between layers, allowing 1 pound of sugar for every 1
pound of angelica.
Cover and leave for 2 to 3 days.
Slide contents of the bowl into a heavy-based pan. Bring very slowly to the
boil and simmer until the angelica feels perfectly tender and looks clear.
Drain, then roll or toss the shoots on greaseproof paper thickly strewn
with sugar, letting the angelica take up as much sugar as will stick to it.
Then dry off the angelica - without letting it become hard - in the oven,
using the lowest possible temperature. I place the stalks directly on the
oven shelves (with trays underneath to catch any falling sugar) and find
they need about 3 hours. Wrap and store after cooling completely. Packed
into pretty little boxes, home-candied angelica makes a charming present.

Angelica stem survey
This is a survey. Have you eaten candied angelica stems? Did you like it?
Would you eat them again?
Reply to HeK@hetta.pp.fi, please use Subject: Candied angelica. Survey
results will appear in subsequent editions of this FAQ.
(It doesn't have to be A. archangelica, any Angelica will do. A. sylvestris
is much harsher in taste though).

Answers to this survey so far:

   * From Ingolfur Guðnason <engiherb@smart.is>:
     Since you are asking: yes, I have tried to make candied angelica from
     young leaf stalks. It is very nice. I keep a jar in my refrigerator
     and serve it to guests as a curiosity.
     In the times of the Vikings candied angelica was in very high esteem,
     sold as a candy in the streets of Norway and British Isles etc.
   * From Francoise Chevallier Allard <fcallard@univ-lyon1.fr>:
     It is commonly used for cakes in central Europe, and in Italy for
     icecreams. I think it is nice, but perhaps a little strong.
   * From "Mike Toop" <miketoop@uniserve.com>
     I just made candied angelica (A. archangelica) for the first time. It
     has... an interesting flavour. I would try it again. In fact, I'm
     willing to try just about anything to use up the stuff... it is
     growing like crazy in my garden!
   * From david@inf.rl.ac.uk (David Johnston)
     Yes, I have eaten Candied angelica stems. When I was small, my mother
     would decorate the top of an iced cake using angelica and glace'
     cherries. The combination of the red and green detail on a ground of
     white icing is very attractive visually. The trick was to cut the
     (expensive) candied stems into thin slices to make it go further.
     When I'd grown up, I bought some candied angelica for my own larder,
     and permitted myself a taste in isolation. The taste is superb, and
     memories from my childhood flooded back! I would eat candied angelica
     all the time if it wasn't so expensive. As a result, I've been trying
     to grow angelica for about 10 years. Finally, last year a seed
     germinated and now I'm attempting to candy the stem. That is why I
     looked up the FAQ!
   * From "Duane Harding" <hardid@calmvs.ercb.gov.ab.ca>
     My dad use to buy it in New York City in the early 1970's. We used it
     to flavour Christmas pudding.

2.37 Sweet Cicely

Latin name: Myrrhis odorata

=====
2.37.1 Growing sweet cicely
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
You have a wild garden, a long way away from anywhere else? No? Then don't
grow this. Sweet cicely likes half shade and a moist, rich soil (like
angelica), but is horribly invasive when it likes the conditions. It is a
perennial 2-3' high, with deep roots. Like most umbellifers, the individual
plants are short lived, but it seeds itself like crazy. Its leaves are a
pretty mottled green, and are large and fairly deeply cut.

=====
2.37.2 Harvesting sweet cicely
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
Its leaves can be dried, though this is tricky, or its seeds can be
collected.

=====
2.37.3 Using / preserving sweet cicely
-----
From: nmm1@cam.ac.uk (Nick Maclaren):
It is naturally sweet (like angelica), but has a mild aniseed flavour; very
pleasant, if you like aniseed. It can be added to stewed fruits, other
puddings etc., or used in pot pourris.

2.38 Mexican Mint Marigold (MMM)/ Mexican Tarragon

Latin name: Tagetes lucida (T.florida).
Common names: Mexican Marigold Mint, Mexican Mint Marigold, Mexican Mint
Tarragon, Mint Marigold, Texas Tarragon, Sweet Marigold, Cloud Plant,
Yerbanis, Hierba anis, Coronilla, Pericon
=====
2.38.1 Growing MMM
-----
From: Chris McElrath <Mcmariah@AOL.COM>
The following descriptive information is taken from "The Herb Garden
Cookbook" by Lucinda Hutson.
Characteristics of MMM: "Glossy lance-shaped leaves, finely serrated:strong
anise scent; brilliant golden marigold-like flowers in fall; perennial".
MMM likes "loose, well-draining soil; full sun"
Propagation: roots easily in water; readily reseeds Plant seeds in the
fall, germination in a few days.
Mature plant will be appr. 2 feet tall and 1 foot wide.
Especially good in hot, dry conditions where French tarragon won't grow.

=====
2.38.3 Using / preserving MMM
-----
From: Chris McElrath <Mcmariah@AOL.COM>
MMM is the best available substitute for Tarragon (see 2.11). The french
word for tarragon is "Estragon" which means "little dragon". MMM lacks the
fiery flavor of tarragon, but its anise flavor is more pronounced. In
Mexico MMM is used as a medicinal tea to calm stomachs and nerves, cure
colds, alleviate hangovers. Allegedly, the Aztecs used MMM in a numbing
powder which they blew into sacrificial victims' faces to calm their fears.
Besides as a tarragon substitute, MMM can be used as a pleasant tea
flavoring. It is tasty added to sangria, punches, mulled cider. Also good
in vinaigrettes.

Mexican Mint Tarragon Chicken

This recipe I have tried and it is quite good. It comes from Lucinda
Hutson's "The Herb Garden Cookbook"

4 boneless chicken breasts
salt and pepper to taste
3 green onions, with tops
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
2-3 Tbsp fresh marigold mint, chopped
3 Tbsp Dijon mustard
2 tsp. honey2 Tbsp butter, softened
1 Tbsp white wine

Slightly flatten chicken breasts and trim excess fat. Sprinkle with salt
and pepper. Set aside.
Combine the remaining ingredients to make a thick paste. Place appr. 1 1/2
Tbsp. of the paste on each breast. Roll up tightly. Place seam side down on
a lightly oiled baking dish and dot breasts with any remaining herb
mixture.
Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes. Slice into
medallions to serve.

Marigold Mint Vinaigrette

2 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 tsp honey
1/4 cup MMM vinegar or tarragon vinegar
1 Tbsp chopped MMM
1/2 cup olive oil
pinch of salt and cayenne

Blend the egg yolk, garlic, mustard, pepper and honey with a fork. Add the
vinegar and chopped herbs; mix well. Slowly whish in the oil in a steady
stream until thickened. Adjust seasonings.

Tomatoes Rellenos

4 med. size tomatoes
Salt
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 Tbsp fresh lime juice
3 Tbsp MMM vinegar or tarragon vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 tsp dried mustard
1 Tbsp tomato paste

Peel tomatoes (if desired) by plunging them in boiling water for 30
seconds, then immediately immersing them in cold water. Cut tops off
tomatoes and remove some of the pulp. Lightly salt the shells and invert
them on paper towels to drain.
Make the vinaigrette by combining garlic, lime juice, vinegar, olive oil,
dried mustard, tomato paste, brown sugar, and half of the fresh herbs.
Dribble a small amount of vinaigrette (reserve half) into each shell, and
chill.
Combine corn, zucchini, green onion, bell pepper, salt, pepper and the
remaining herbs. Mix with remaining vinaigrette and chill for several
hours.
Generously stuff each tomato with the corn/squash mixture, and drizzle any
remaining vinaigrette over the top.

Following is a really good marinade using Mexican Mint Marigold. It's from
our herb society's soon-to-be-published cookbook. I made it yesterday and
marinated some chicken breasts in it before grilling. Delish!
But first a comment about Lucinda Hutson, from who's book Chris took the
MMM info. She has come down from Austin (to San Antonio) several times to
speak to our club. She is one of the most delightful people! The first time
she had slides of her house and garden - to die for! The next time she
talked about her newest book on tequila and had slides of her travels in
Mexico researching it. She obviously had a *lot* of fun.
Now for the marinade.

Herb Marinade

(Marjie Christopher)

1 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon dried onion flakes
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves
2 tablespoons chopped fresh Mexican Mint Marigold or French Tarragon
leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Pour wine vinegar into blender jar. Add remaining ingredients; blend at low
speed for 10 seconds. Pour into jar with tight cover and refrigerate.
Makes 1 3/4 cups. Good as marinade for poultry, beef, pork, or lamb.

The 'How to grow it' -Project

From: drt@MCS.COM (Donald Tveter) :

The "How to grow it" -project is a sort of self-organizing FAQ for
rec.gardens and the Internet. You can participate if you keep a website.
This is how you do it:

If you add your experience about growing some plant to your website please
also add the artificial keyword "howtogrow" near the top of your page. Then
anyone searching for information on the plant can go to a web searcher and
give it the name of the plant and the keyword "howtogrow". For instance I
know how to grow Texas Bluebonnets here in Chicago so I put the following
heading on my Texas Bluebonnet file:

* <title>How to Grow Texas Bluebonnet</title>
* <li>howtogrow lupinus texensis or Texas bluebonnet
* <li>location Chicago Illinois US zone5

          (HeK comment: I put -this- header on the original version of this
          FAQ:
          <META NAME="KeyWords" CONTENT="howtogrow culinary herbs"> )

Now if somebody wants to know how to grow Texas bluebonnets you go to a
searcher like Lycos, Alta Vista or Hotbot and give it the following words
to search for:

* howtogrow lupinus texensis

or if you don't know the scientific name use:

* howtogrow texas bluebonnet

Right now I know this works for Hotbot at [http://www.hotbot.com/]

3.1 Herbs for groundcover

Also see Growing chamomile, 2.7.1, above.
-----
From: jera@ksu.ksu.edu
I've found the following plants useful as groundcovers. Unless otherwise
noted, all are perennial, and hardy in my Zone 5 (north-central Kansas)
garden.

   * pennyroyal, Mentha pulegium
     Don't fertilize this regularly, it doesn't need the encouragement).
     NON-EDIBLE.
   * lemon thyme, Thymus x citriodoratus
     Otherwise known as the thyme that ate Cleveland; semi-evergreen in my
     garden.
   * mother-of-thyme, Thymus serphyllum
     Semi-evergreen, turns a lovely bronzed-purple color in the winter.
   * caraway thyme, Thymus herba-barona
     Used in the late Middle Ages to flavor baron of beef, hence the name.
     A very low, flat, spreading plant with a fascinating fragrance &
     flavor.
   * oregano thyme, Thymus sp.
     Grows much like mother-of-thyme, wonderful oregano scent and flavor.
   * common thyme, Thymus vulgaris
   * Aztec sweet herb, Lippia dulcis
     Low, sprawling annual; odd, resiny scent; it's supposed to self-seed
     readily, cuttings root fairly easily.
   * oregano, Origanum vulgare
     May be a bit tall for a groundcover, especially after 2-3 years;
     spreads vigorously; attractive flowers.
   * germander, Teucrium chamaedrys
     NON-EDIBLE but fun, a broadleaf evergreen; great for rock gardens and
     retaining walls; attractive flowers.
   * mints, Mentha sp.
     These may be a bit tall for many uses, but for a moist spot that's
     hard to mow, or that washes out frequently, give them a try - I've
     found that the candy-scented varieties are somewhat less invasive.
   * chamomile, Chamaemelum nobile + Matricaria recutita
     These don't grow well in my area, it's too hot and dry; one is annual,
     one perennial.

-----
From mflesch@mail.coin.missouri.edu (Mary A. Flesch):
I can't believe no one has mentioned the mint family in this group. At my
last house, I planted a tiny spearmint plant to have in iced tea (I'm
originally from Louisville, KY and was also planning on juleps). By the
time I moved 2 years later, I was able to dig it up and give to four
friends while still leaving plenty for the new owners!

3.2 Herbs you can't get rid of (= easy gardening)

-----
Also see Growing horseradish, 2.20.1, above.

From: ecoli@cix.compulink.co.uk (Peter Harris)
Marigold and nasturtium. Just sprinkle a few packets around and your only
future problem is thinning them down each year.

From: HeK@hetta.pp.fi
Then there are the mints, horseradish, and comfrey. Both should be planted
in containers which are dug into the ground to avoid them taking over the
garden, and to make it possible to get rid of them if you decide to.

-----
From: ecoli@cix.compulink.co.uk (Peter Harris)
Fennel is the obvious one, the tinted variety is nice although I only have
the ordinary. Really good fun is lovage, it can be huge. It is known in
Germany as the "Maggi Herb" and is a constituent of that proprietory food
enhancer. It has a pretty strong "dark" taste and was used to "extend"
stews. I.e. it made a stew taste as thought there was more meat in it than
there really was!

Latin names: Lovage = Levisticum officinale. Fennel = Foeniculum vulgare.

From HeK@hetta.pp.fi
Some nice tall medicinal herbs: Angelica archangelica, if permitted to
flower; Inula helenium, with nice yellow flowers; Verbascum thapsus and
some other mulleins; some of the Malva sp.; the Russian variety of
Artemisia dracunculus; and some of the Rudbeckia sp., like Rudbeckia
laciniata. More? Sure, but I can't remember any offhand. Can you?

3.4 Herbs for shade

-----
From: eberts@donald.uoregon.edu (sonny hays-eberts)
Sweet cicely and woodruff are two I've had good luck with, in heavy shade.
Most culinary herbs prefer full sun. Those that are shade tolerant, as a
general rule, are not as heavy on flavor.

From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
Many of the broader leaf herbs will grow in the shade, especially the ones
that tend to bolt. A good example of this is cilantro or parsley.

3.5 Growing herbs indoors

-----
> I love cooking with fresh herbs so I tried growing my own. I planted
basil, chives, dill, and parsley in June. The chives are doing fine.

From: Catherine A Hensley <hensley@lims1.lanl.gov>
I have bad news. The chives will eventually begin to look sickly, because
they will become root-bound and they will also be expecting a cool spell.
When this happens, remove them from the pot, break off a chunk of plant and
roots, and move these to a new pot. Then put them in the refrigerator for a
week or two, and then back out on the window sill.

> The basil is OK; however, it is not growing as tall and thick as I had
imagined. I suspect that it needs more sunlight.

Basil that needs more light tends to get leggy--long spindly growth and few
leaves. Is that the problem? Another possiblility is that the basil is
root-bound. How large is the pot, compared to how large the
plant is? If the pot is in danger of falling over from the weight of the
plant, or if the plant is dropping leaves, move the whole thing to a larger
pot.

> My parsley looks like it is dying a slow death. It is not really growing,
and the leaves near the bottom have yellowed and sort of mushed into the
soil! Did I overwater? Is it the temperature? I keep the AC on.

Parsley in the soil grows a long tap root, like a carrot (same family). In
a shallow pot, it can't do that, so the root splits into many thinner roots
and go around and around the pot until it runs out of soil. Yup, root-bound
again. Next time try to find a narrow but deep pot.

> My dill looks about the same as the parsley. I know I should not have
planted it in the summer. It went to seed almost immediately. Should I
throw it out? Is there anything I can do?

Going to seed immediately is a sign of stress, although I don't know if
dill usually has a tap root too. Anyway, as an annual herb, it's now past
its prime and can't be made to get young again. <g>

> Should I not be growing these herbs inside? Are there any herbs or
peppers that are good to grow indoors? If so, what are they, and when
should I plant them? I am especially interested in cilantro, mint, and
jalapeno peppers.

In spite of its problems, many people grow parsley inside, so that's okay.
Dill grows to about 3 ft, so that is probably not a good choice. Basil is
good, but it is an annual, so expect to sow some more as the seasons pass.
I grow rosemary inside successfully, but before I gained some experience I
killed three in three years. Peppers can be grown inside, but they like
bright light, and in order to have fruit the flowers must be
hand-pollinated (not as hard as it sounds, sometimes you can just thump the
flowers with your fingertip to encourage self-pollinating). I also grow
lemon-scented geranium and ginger inside over the winter, although they
live outside during the summer.

Anyway, good luck

Catherine

3.6 Growing herbs from cuttings

-----
> Has anyone ever tried to root lavender before? I am trying it and I'm not
quite sure if I'm doing it right. I have taken long woody stems from my
outdoor plant and have placed them in damp sand in potting pots indoors. I
believe I am just to keep the soil moist, is this correct? Also, how long
should it take before roots develope and I am able to transplant them?

From ceci@lysator.liu.se (Ceci Henningsson):
This is something about lavender that I wrote for rec.gardens some time
ago. It works well with most herbs. For particularly watery-stemmed plants
(think impatiens) putting them in a jar with water, like you describe works
well. If you add just a teeny-weeny pinch of rooting hormone to the water,
you'll be surprised at how quickly the cuttings develop lots of roots.

Lavender is one of the easiest plants (along with fuchsias) to take
cuttings from, so it's a good idea to start with them if you're not
familiar with the technique.

In addition to what you do, I do the following: I take fairly new stems and
pinch out the flower buds. New stems root easier than older, woodier stems.
For this reason cuttings are often taken in spring when there are lots of
new stems. If your cuttings fail now, try again in spring. (Disregard that
if you're in the southern hemisphere.) The reason I pinch out the buds, is
that I want the plant-to-be to concentrate on making roots, not on
flowering and setting seed. I cut the stem from the plant just above a leaf
pair, and then I cut the stem just below a leaf pair. It may seem wasteful
to throw a large portion of the stem in the compost, but it won't grow any
roots anyway (or at least not as easily as the part just below the leaves).
I also remove the leaves below soil level.

Start by watering the growing medium. I usually water it so that water
comes out at the bottom. That means it is fairly wet. Then I level the
surface before coming back to the cutting. I use what my local nursery
sells as "sowing soil". It is potting soil with 1/3 sand added.

Before I insert the stem into the growing medium, I dip the lower part (the
one that will be below the surface) in a rooting hormone, that will aid the
formation of roots. If you don't have any rooting hormone at home, you can
get it at your garden center. It doesn't cost much, and lasts a lifetime,
so it's really a cheap investment. Because you now have the powder on the
stem, you can't just push the stem into the growing medium, or you will rub
off the powder. Instead you poke a hole into it, and insert the stem. Make
sure there is contact between the stem and the growing medium. That is
called "firming in". Then I take a clear polythene bag, cut a few small
holes into it and put it over the pot. Place the pots in the shade. Too
much sun and heat will dry out the plants before they have formed any roots
to take up water with. Rooting usually takes a few weeks.

Some general advice:

   * Think about hygiene. This is something to do on the clean kitchen
     counter, rather than on the lawn, because you want to introduce as few
     germs and fungus spores as possible. Since soil and plant material
     from the garden carries a lot of microbes which are harmful to people
     (tetanus and parasite eggs for instance), it's vital for your health
     that you clean the counter afterwards. If you have a greenhouse or
     potting shed you can do this in, that's probably the best place.
   * Check on the cuttings from time to time. They won't need any water for
     the first few weeks until they have formed roots if you have them
     under plastic bags. You can see that roots have formed when there's
     new (light-green) growth on the cuttings. Have patience and don't put
     them in the garden at once. They need to be a bit more established
     first. I suggest that, depending on the size of the pot you're using
     and how exposed to sun and winds the site is, to wait for maybe 1
     month after new growth is showing before planting out.
   * Place as few cuttings as possible in each pot. That way, if you get a
     fungus infection in one pot, the whole lot won't be ruined. Also, use
     small pots. Soil that is not "used" by roots has a tendency to get
     stale, and that's something you have to avoid here.
   * When planting out, remember that lavender plants get quite big,
     although the cuttings seem tiny. I know from experience that it's easy
     to be tempted into putting them quite close to each other.

This is getting to sound quite complicated, though, in real life, it isn't.
I've taken maybe 10 lavender cuttings at 3 occassions, and none of them
failed. Lavender cuttings seem particularly tough. Some times I've been
convinced that they had died when they were bone-dry, but they've always
come back to life with the help of some water.

3.8.1 Fungicides in general and for damping off
-----
>I need help identifying a whitish fuzz that's causing our rosemaries to
shrivel and die back. Then I need help figuring out what to do about it. I
have tried washing it off, but it keeps returning within a week. One of the
big ones seems to have died completely from this already, the others have
mostly only new growth left alive. Is it possible that the fuzzy mildew
from our neighbor's grape vines could have taken hold on rosemary?

From: Joyce Schillen <gardenpg@cdsnet.net>
[http://www.cdsnet.net/Business/GardenPages:]
http://www.cdsnet.net/Business/GardenPages:

What you describe certainly sounds like a fungus, of which powdery mildew
is one. A very good fungicide is 3 tablespoons baking soda, 2 1/2
tablespoons horticultural oil (also called ultrafine oil or summer spray
oil) and 1/2 teaspoon liquid soap mixed in a gallon of water. Spray all
surfaces about every ten days. This has been tested extensively by Cornell
U. for black spot on roses, and in Israel for powdery mildew on squashes.
Some plants are sensitive to the oil, so test it on a small section first
to make sure there's no phytotoxicity.

Another good fungicide is strong chamomile tea. This works great on damping
off disease in seedlings:
Pour 1 cup boiling water over 1/4 cup chamomile blossoms and let steep
until cool. Then strain into a spray bottle. Spray on seedlings AND soil
whenever evidence of damping off disease or other fungus appears.
I swear, this is nearly magical. I've seen it completely knock down that
white cottony growth that shows up on soil surfaces and makes seedlings
keel over and die. The tea only keeps a week or so before turning rancid,
so that's why I make such small quantities.

From: Kathryn M. Bensinger <kbensin@MAIL.STATE.TN.US>:

What you will find inside any plant suffering from fungus is the vegetative
body know as mycelium. What you see above the stem surface is actually the
fruiting body of the fungus. The mushrooms you eat are just the fruiting
body, the rest of the "plant" is below ground. If you slice open a twig or
stem of an infected plant (dying or dead) and find squiggley line which
resemble threads or fine root hairs, you have fungus. Most mycelium is
whitish or tannish but may be other colors depending on which fungus; one
toadstool has blood red!

Both vinegar and baking soda will work by altering the pH of the plants
surface; one to very acid, the other to very alkaline. This allows the
plants natural resistance with an edge so it can throw off the fungus.
Baking soda is used most often with powdery mildew because this fungus
likes cool, humid, acidic environments. It works best before the "powder"
shows. Here in TN the summers are always so humid it feels like you could
wring the air and I spray my bergamont and other suseptible plants with
baking soda/ water mix once a week from before any sign of fungus til
humidity levels drop (about the end of June til end of Sept). It works.

Vinegar works everywhere baking soda doesn't - this is my choice when I
don't know which fungus I'm dealing with.

Healthy plants never get fungus. Too much fertilizer causing too lush
growth, light conditions which are low and (plants get leggy), night
temperatures that are too cool or too hot, and (especially in
winter)waterlogged soil due to poor drainage, etc. are all stress which
weaken the plant and allow fungus the opportunity to move in.

4.1 Vinegars

Also see at least 2.4.3 / Chive Vinegar, 4.6.3 / Rose Vinegar, 2.27 Borage
Vinegar, and 2.9.3 / Mint Vinegar.
-----
From: adawson@ehs.eduhsd.k12.ca.us
Hmm...I have made many herbal vinegars for my own home use and have always
used cidar vinegar. This, for me, has always seemed quite sufficient and is
very economical. Is there any reason why cidar vinegar is not acceptable?
Have I unknowingly been commiting a culinary crime? Also, I have found bay
leaf and rosemary to produce a very well flavored vinegar.

-----
From: HerbalMuse@aol.com
Not at all...I use either apple cider vinegar, or white vinegar, depending
on what kind of herb/flower is to be infused.

-----
From: christopher@gn.apc.org (christopher hedley)
I use cider vinegar.
How about Rosemary vinegar which can be used as a hair rinse as well as in
cooking and Garlic vinegar which is a good general antiseptic as well as
excellent salad dressing.
Good looking labels are an important final touch.

-----
After asking about uses for a combination of parsley, sage, rosemary and
thyme I got the following reply:

From: kate@netway.net (Kate Blacklock):
It makes great flavored vinegar!

Which of course sounds intriguing and has to be tried. ;)

-----
From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
Basically, if you like it as an herb, put a good sized sprig of it in some
white vinegar and wait a couple of months and try it. This works with sage
(don't leave it too long), oregano, tarragon, thyme (may have to leave it
longer) and chives that I can think of.

Rose petal vinegar
From: Baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Gwen Baker):
1 c rose petals
3 whole cloves
2 c white wine vinegar

Trim away white part of rose petals. Wash and drain thoroughly. Slightly
bruise petals and place with cloves in a wide mouth canning jar. Place
vinegar in a medium saucepan bring to a boil. Pour vinegar over petals,
cover at once with metal lids, and screw bands tight. Let stand at room
temp for 1 week. Strain vinegar into decorative jars, discarding rose
petals. Seal jars with a cork or other airtight lid. Makes 2 cups.

Herbed Vinegars

Cayenne Vinegar

Put from a 1/4 to 1/2 ounce of the best cayenne pepper into a bottle. Pour
on it a pint of strong vinegar. Cork it closely, and shake it well every 23
days. It may remain any length of time but will be ready in about 2 weeks.

Celery Vinegar

Add to a pint of boiling vinegar a few grains of cayenne pepper, or 1/2 oz
peppercorns, a teaspoon of salt and 2 C white portion of the roots and
stems of fresh celery, sliced thin. Let boil 2-3 mins, turn into a stone
jar and close tightly as soon as cold. It may be strained off and bottled
in 3-4 weeks with out injury.

Chili or Capsicum Vinegar

Put an oz of chilies or capsicums into a pint of vinegar, cover closely and
let stand 2 weeks. After straining the vinegar will then be ready to use.

Cucumber Vinegar

First wipe then without paring, slice young cucumbers into a stone jar.
Pour on sufficient boiling vinegar to cover. Add a t of salt and 2/3 the
quantity of peppercorns to 1 1/2 pints of vinegar. The mixture may remain
thus for a month, or even two months if well protected from the air. It
should then be strained, allowed to settle, and poured quite clear into
small dry bottles, which should be tightly corked. A mild onion may be
mixed with the cucumbers, if it is desired.

Horseradish Vinegar

On 4 oz of young and freshly scraped horseradish pour a quart of boiling
vinegar, and cover closely. The vinegar should be ready in 3-4 days. But
the mixture may remain for weeks or months before straining. An oz of
shallot, minced may be substituted for one oz of horseradish if the flavor
is preferred.

Mint Vinegar

Slightly chop or bruise the young leaves of freshly gathered mint pack in
bottles, filing nearly to the neck, pour in vinegar to; cover the mint. In
50 days strain off and bottle for use.

Nasturtium Vinegar

Loosely fill a quart jar with clean nasturtium flowers. Add a finely
chopped shallot, a very small piece of garlic, and a piece of red pepper.
Fill the jar with cold vinegar, and let stand 2 months. Add 1 t of salt,
strain through several thicknesses of cheesecloth and store in sterilized
jars closely sealed.

Raspberry Vinegar

Crush 4 qts raspberries and cover with 4 qts mild vinegar. After 2 days
strain through doubled cheesecloth and pour the same vinegar over a further
4 qts of berries. Let stand again for 2 days. Strain, measure. Add 2 #
sugar for each quart of liquid, bringing slowly to boiling point. Boil 10
minutes then skim, turn into sterilized jars and seal. (Use 2-3 T in a
glass of icewater for a pleasant summer drink)

Raspberry strawberry Vinegar

Use the same recipe as for Raspberry Vinegar only half the quantity for
each fruit.

Shallot Vinegar

Over 46 oz shallots peeled and bruised, pour a quart of good vinegar. Cover
closely and in 23 weeks vinegar may be used after straining. A few drops is
sufficient flavor for sauces and dressings.

Onion Vinegar

Same as for shallot.

Garlic Vinegar

Make the same as for shallot using only 1/2 the quantity of garlic.

Tarragon Vinegar

Strip the tarragon from the large stalks. Put into small stone jar or wide
necked jar, and in doing this, twist some of the branches so as to bruise
the leaves and tear them apart. Pour in enough very pale vinegar so as to
cover the top. Allow to infuse for about 2 months or more. Strain into
small bottles and cork.

4.1.1 Vinaigrette
-----
From: Pat Peck <arpeck@FREENET.SCRI.FSU.EDU>

A vinaigrette is just a simple quick and easy way to dress a salad without
sacrificing the taste. Usually a vinaigrette call for oil in a 3 to 1 ratio
to the vinegar. That's what's so much fun about using vinaigrettes. You can
experiment and use all of those vinegars and oils you've made from the
herbs in your garden.

A classic french vinaigrette is:

2 tablespoons wine vinegar (any type of herbal vinegar you might like)
6 tablespoons olive oil, extra virgin preferred (sometimes I'll use 2
tablespoons of the 6 with garlic oil, rosemary oil, basil oil, lemon oil
(homemade of course)
1 teaspoon salt (I use less - to taste)
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Put vinegar, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Beat the mixture with wire
whisk or fork until the salt dissolves. Add the olive oil and beat until
creamy. Let stand for 5 minutes and beat again.

For garlic version Add a clove of crushed garlic after the olive oil has
been beaten. Let stand for 10 minutes, remove garlic and beat again. As I
stated above sometimes I'll use 2 tablespoons of garlic oil instead of
clove of garlic. Makes 1/2 cup.

Another tangier type of vinaigrette

3/4 cup olive oil, extra virgin
2 tablespoons wine vinegar (here again experiment with herbal vinegars)
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon mustard (dijon) or 1/2 teaspoon dried mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Put vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, salt and pepper in bowl and whisk until
salt dissolves. Add olive and and mix well. Let stand 10 minutes. Whisk
again before serving. Makes 1 cup.

A lot of times I just use a jar and shake it all together. Makes it easy
and quick.

If you really feel lazy, dump into food processor. This mustard & thyme
vinaigrette is especially good done in a food processor.

7 Tbsp. olive oil
2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar (this one plain red wine vinegar is best)
1 Tbsp. Dijon
1/2 tsp. dried thyme or 2 tsp. fresh thyme (lemon thyme is nice or oregano
thyme (I really have such a thing)
2 tsps. soy sauce
1 small clove garlic, coarsely chopped
1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper

Put vinegar, dijon mustard (again use dried mustard 1/2 to 3/4 tsp. is you
prefer), thyme, soy sauce, garlic and pepper into food processor.

Pulse for 3 seconds or until well blended. Add the olive oil and pulse
again until fully integrated. Makes 2/3 cup.

4.2 Herb oil

-----
From: edbw@unixg.ubc.ca (Edgar Wickberg)
All homemade herb or vegetable flavoured oils have doubtful safety if they
are not refrigerated immediately and kept in the refrigerator. The reason
for concern is botulism. Clostridium botulinum, the organism that makes the
deadly poison that results in botulism, grows in airfree environments. It
is only when it grows that it produces the toxin. Putting anything up in
oil produces a really great airfree (oxygen-free) environment and therefore
the risk of toxin production. Clostridium botulinum is a very common
organism in all of our environments, but the organism itself isn't
dangerous to us. It requires, besides the airfree environment, a low acid
one and temperatures above fridge temps. This is probably more than you
ever wanted to hear about why not to make garlic flavoured oil. Why not dry
most of your garlic so it will last and make just a little oil and keep it
in the fridge. To make the kind that you store in the fridge, just heat a
small quantity of oil (of your choice), put a few peeled cloves of garlic
in a small bottle, pour the hot oil over, cool for half an hour, cover and
refrigerate.

-----
From: baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (gwen baker)
Take the cleaned herbs and place into a jar (a mason jar will do). Heat the
oil to just warm (too hot and you will cook the herbs instead of extracting
the taste), pour the warm oil over the herbs and let set. Check every 3
days to once a week, straining and adding additional herbs until the
desired flavor is reached.

HeK comment to above: keep in refrigerator until desired flavor is reached
and thereafter.

==========

4.3 Drying your herbs

-----
From: aks3@cornell.edu (Amy Smith):
You don't need anything terribly high tech to dry herbs...

For leaves you can use old window screens in a DRY DARK place (like the
attic). If you are growing seedlings, place the screens on the top of the
fluorescent lights.

For roots you might want to use the oven on low. Chopping the roots first
helps. Food hydrators are better for roots.

Flowers are like leaves but you MUST be careful about keeping it dark. (the
sun leeches the nutrients out of herbs and they disintegrate too.)

You can also hang bunches of leaves on string in a dark place outside (if
you are in a fairly low humid climate) Or put flowers or leaves in paper
sacks and hang them to dry (shake them or stir them periodically so they
don't stick together inside the sack.)

-----
From: ?:
Never store herbs in completely airtight containers unless you have access
to a desiccant (like you get in pill bottles) to store with them since you
will never perfectly dry them and therefore they need to breathe.

-----
From: jrogow@ridgecrest.ca.us (Judith Rogow), in response to above:
An old remedy - tie a few grains of rice in a bit of cheese cloth and add
it to the bottle if you must keep it tightly closed.

-----
From HeK:
Never use a microwave to dry herbs. First, timing and stuff is different
for different microwave ovens, second, the taste isn't that good, and
third, you can end up with a fire in your kitchen.

If you use a dehydrator never go above 40 deg. Celcius. Most herbs are
tasty because of volatile oils and in high temperatures these volatile oils
get volatile and your herbs get tasteless.

And, if you use the bunched-herbs -method outlined above, strip the leaves
off the stalks after your herbs are dry. Stalks aren't that tasty in soups,
and can be tossed on barbecue coals to give some taste there.

==========

4.4 Freezing your herbs

-----
From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
The best way to do it is to cut the leaves off and then put them into a
tight container and freeze them. If you are in a hurry you can put in the
stems too and cut the leaves off later.

From HeK:
I've found the best way to freeze parsley is to cut it fine before
freezing. Then you can scrap some directly from the jar into your
soup/sauce/whatever without having to cut it while it's frozen / going
mushy on you. I've done this for the others I've frozen as well - dill at
least is way too stringy to be easily cut when frozen.

From: baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (gwen baker)
Chop the herbs into the desired size and place into a ice cube tray. You
can fit a premeasured amount in so you know how much in each segment (I use
a tblsp). Then add just enough water to cover the chopped leaf and freeze.
You can pop out the cubes and store in bags and have the flavor of fresh
herbs year round.

From: mrooney@mrooney.pn.com (Michael Rooney)
Another great way is to make them into pesto. Try different herbs with
pignoli nuts, pecans (dill and pecan is one of my favorites), walnuts,
almonds, hazelnuts, etc. until you find the combinations you like. We
freeze the pestos by putting saran wrap over a pint ice cream top (yes, the
plastic one from a Dutch sounding one made really in NJ :-)), forcing in as
much pesto as we can, and putting the saran wrap over the top. Then we wrap
it in aluminium foil and label it and put it in the freezer. The best part
is we have it all winter long and it tastes great on many things,
especially pasta, chicken, pork, shrimp, fish, etc.

4.5 Herb butter

-----
Basic recipe for Herb Butter
From: "Janice D. Seals" <DianeTN5@AOL.COM>, quoting "The Herbal Pantry" by
Emelie Tolley and Chris Mead:

1/2 pound(2 sticks) unsalted butter
5 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs and/or herb flowers, or 5 teaspoons dried
herbs or 2 1/2 teaspoons herb seeds.

Chop the herbs very fine or pulverize the seeds. Cream the butter and blend
in the herbs and seasonings. Shape as desired and chill or freeze up to 6
months.
Makes 1/2 pound.

Suggested combinations:

   * Dill, mustard seed, parsley, and a touch of lemon rind or a few
     mustard seeds for fish and potatoes.
   * Thyme, garlic, chives, oregano, and parsley for tomatoes, zucchini,

For a pretty presentation, cut herb butters into decorative shapes and
garnish or wrap a block of butter in rose geranium leaves and let stand
overnight to absorb their sweet flavor.

Herb Butter
From HeK@hetta.pp.fi

1 part butter (room temperature)
1 part oil (room temperature)
2-5 parts water (room temperature) (optional)
either finely chopped fresh herbs, or crushed dry herbs, to taste
salt?

Blend butter and oil together, add finely chopped herbs to taste, add water
in drops (like you add oil when you make mayonnaise).
Can't say if you need to add some salt to this recipe, but I'm used to it,
as Finnish butter always contains salt.
My favorite herbs to add to this: parsley, or lovage, or celeriac leaves,
or fresh black currant leaves (Ribes nigrum) - Yum! Don't restrict yourself
to garden-grown herbs, there's lots of good stuff growing in the woods and
fields. And let your taste buds decide.
I make a larger batch and freeze what I won't use right away - if you add
water this will only keep for about a week or so in the fridge.

> PS... Anyone like basil jelly? B-)

From: Sallie Montuori <foxdale@widomaker.com>

Haven't tried that yet, but I really like herb jellies. After trying
rosemary jelly, I will never put mint sauce on lamb again!!! And I found
that thyme jelly makes a terrific sauce for chicken.
But what does one do with basil jelly? None of my knee-jerk reactions for
basil includes "sweet."

-----
From: Judy Martin-Spiker <judyms@lsid.hp.com>

My fiancee puts it in peanut butter and basil jelly sandwiches! He loves
them! Personally, I think its a little revolting, but Basil jelly would go
nice with pastas or italian cuisine, maybe even on garlic bread. Maybe an
addition to pesto? The recipe is as follows:

Basil jelly

1 cup (lightly packed) fresh basil leaves - the fresher the better!
1 cup white vinegar
1 Tbsp lemon juice
2 cups water
6 1/2 cups sugar
Two 3 oz. pouches Certo liquid pectin
Green food coloring (just enough to give it a nice emerald green color,
about 7 drops or up to 1 teaspoon full)

Place the basil leaves, lemon juice and vinegar in an 8 to 10 quart sauce
pot. The larger size is necessary since this recipe boils up a LOT. Let the
basil, lemon juice and vinegar stand while you are measuring the two cups
water. Add the water and food coloring. Heat almost to boil, stirring to
blend, then add all the sugar at once. Stir to dissolve sugar. Bring to
hard boil, add two 3-ounce pouches of Certo liquid pectin, 6 ounces total.
(Make sure to get as much of the 6 ounces as you can into the kettle, and
not all over your hands and stove, like I normally do! The jelly will not
set without all the pectin.) Bring back to boil, boil hard for 1 minute or
until jelly point is reached. Remove from heat. Remove basil leaves with
slotted spoon. Pour immediately into hot, sterilized 1/2 pint jars, seal
and process 10 minutes in boiling water bath. Makes 6 to 7 half pints.
This recipe produces a nicely set jelly that is sweet, but with a real kick
to it! Personally, I like to use 4 different types of basil leaves in the
recipe to add up to one cup, but you may use what you like. This receipe
can also be used for other herbs, like oregano, rosemary, mint, parsley,
thyme, etc.
Hope you enjoy it. I am proud enough of it to enter it in the county fair
this year.

Basic flower jelly recipe - can also be used for herbs
From: bhaile@leo.vsla.edu (Bess Haile):

2 cups flower infusion: steep 2+ cups moderately packed flowers in 2 cups
boiling water at least 30 minutes
1/4 cup lemon juice (E. Toley says not to use bottled, but I do)
4 cups sugar
3 oz of liquid pectin (this will be 1/2 box of liquid Certo)

Bring first 3 ingredients to a boil you can't stir down. Add pectin and
boil 2 minutes. Ladle into hot sterile jars. Seal in preferred manner.

Note (Bess Haile): I prefer the liquid certo to the powdered. It seems to
jell better with flowers. Also, I find the extra minute of boiling helps to
create a stiffer jelly, though 1 minute will create a clear jam-like
texture. I always use the 4 oz canning jars because I can give away some of
the jellies without running out of all my stock. Not everyone likes jelly
from flowers. My own family HATES rose jelly which is one of my favorites.
Also, note, rose petals have a bitter white bit where the petals join the
flower. Cut these off. I do this by holding the flower, step up, and
cutting around the flower, leaving all the bitter bits on the flower. I've
used Rose, Honeysuckle, Lavender, and many herbs too. Rosemary makes a good
jelly for a glaze on roast pork (and probably lamb). Lemon verbena and
spearmint are great too!

Rose petal jelly

From: Baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Gwen Baker)
1 1/2 c rose petals
1 1/2 c white grape juice
1/2 water
3 1/2 c sugar
1 pkg liquid fruit pectin

Trim away white part of rose petals, wash petals thoroughly, and drain.
Combine rose petals and grape juice in a sauce pan. Bring to a rolling
boil, stirring constantly; cook 1 min, stirring frequently. Add fruit
pectin; cook stirring constantly, until mixture returns to a rolling boil.
Continue boiling 1 min, stirring frequently. Remove from heat, and skim off
foam with a metal spoon. Quickly pour jelly into hot sterilized jar leaving
1/4 in headspace; cover with metal lids and screw tight. Process in boiling
water bath for 5 min. Makes 3 pints.

For fun leave the rose petals in and you can tell folks you are eating
roses - they end up with the funniest looks on their faces.

Rose petal jelly II

From: Baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Gwen Baker)
2 quarts fresh rose petals, loosely packed (about 3 dozen roses)
1 quart boiling water
4 cups sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice

Place petals in a large bowl. Add boiling water. Cover and steep for 20
minutes, or until all color is out of the petals. Strain liquid into a
shallow pan. Add sugar and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly until sugar has dissolved, and mixture comes to a rolling boil.
Maintain boil until mixture gives a jelly test (2 drops form on side of
spoon, then flow together). Skim. Pour into hot sterile jars. Cover with
melted paraffin (or use your preferred sealing method). Makes 8 x 6-ounce
jars.

Note (Gwen Baker): The rose petal jelly I have had used added pectin. This
recipe thinks rose petals have enough of their own.

Violet flower jelly

From: Baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Gwen Baker)
Violet infusion:
2 cups violet blossoms (don't have to pack tightly, just nicely full cups
will do)
2 cups boiling water

Pour boiling water on blossoms and cover 12-24 hours (If you can't get to
the cooking within 24 hours, store in the refrigerator).

Jelly recipe:
2 cups infusion
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 pkg. powdered pectin
4 cups sugar

Bring first 3 ingredients to a rolling boil (one you can't stir down). Add
sugar all at once and bring back to rolling boil. Boil for 1 minute. Remove
from heat and let boiling die down. Skim off foam with large spoon. Pour
immediately into hot sterilized jars and seal. Makes 4-5 cups of jelly. I
use the half cup jars so I can give away samples without giving away
everything.

Note (Gwen Baker): I've made two batches of this jelly and it is delicious!
The lemon juice turns the blue infusion the most glorious amethyst color.
No fruit jelly I've ever made has this color. It is tart and lemony, but
does not taste exactly like lemon. My violets are not parma violets, just
plain old Virginia weeds.

Apple jelly with herbal variations

From: gcaselton@easynet.co.uk (Graeme Caselton),
taken from "Preserves & Pickles", by Heather Lambert, publisher: Octopus
Books Ltd.

Apple jelly is quite pleasant plain, especially with hot, buttered scones.
Add herbs and it becomes a delicious jelly to serve with hot and cold fish,
meat and poultry dishes.

1.75 kg (4 lb) cooking apples
1.75 litres (3 pints) cold water
750g (1 1/2 lb) sugar (approximately)

Cut up the apples, discarding any bruised parts. Put in a pan with the
water and bring to the boil, then simmer until very soft. Mash with a
wooden spoon and strain through a jelly bag. Test the juice for pectin; it
should form a firm clot. Put in a pan and add the sugar. Heat gently,
stirring, until dissolved, then boil rapidly until setting point is
reached, stirring occasionally. Remove any scum, pour into small, hot
sterilized jars and cover. Makes about 1.5 kg (3 1/2 lb)

Variations
Some of these jellies, particularly the rosemary and mint ones, can be
melted and poured over ice cream or added to fruit salads.

   * Sage jelly: Add 4 tablespoons chopped sage after removing from the
     heat.
   * Rosemary jelly: Add 8 large rosemary sprigs with the water. Set a
     further sprig in each pot.
   * Dill jelly: Add 4 tablespoons chopped dill or 2 tablespoons dried dill
     weed after removing from heat.
   * Thyme jelly: Add 8 large thyme sprigs with the water. Set a further
     sprig in each jar.
   * Mint jelly: Add a small bunch of mint with the water. Add 6-8
     tablespoons chopped mint after removing from heat.
   * Bouquet Garni jelly: Tie 1 parsley sprig, 2 bay leaves and 1 small
     thyme sprig with a length of sterilized kitchen string. Put one in
     each jar of jelly.

4.6.2 Flower / herb syrup
-----
From: Baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Gwen Baker):

Rose petal syrup

1 c rose petals
1 c water
1 1/2 c sugar
3 whole cloves

Trim away white part of rose petals was and drain thoroughly. Combine rose
petals and water in a sauce pan bring to boil. Then simmer for 5 min. Add
sugar and cloves. Simmer until sugar dissolved (do not reboil) strain
petals, refrigerate. Makes 1 2/3 cup.

Use this for

Rose cooler

1/2 c rose syrup
2 c club soda
fresh rose petals.

Combine soda and syrup garnish with rose petals. Makes 2 1/2 cups.

Violet Syrup
From: TOIVO@aol.com

You need to collect as many violet flowers as you can find. This is the
hardest part--I can almost never find enough. (recipe based on a quart of
violets, increase or decrease according to what you could find. You could
increase the proportion of violets to syrup, making a stronger syrup, but I
wouldn't recommend making it much weaker than this) You may wish to wash
the flowers, depending on where you found them.

The only important piece of information: go through and remove all the
green parts from each flower. Cooked, the green parts taste strong and
spinachy. Just a little green stuff can ruin your whole batch. We learned
this the hard way...

In a double boiler dissolve and heat 2 cups sugar and 3 cups water. If you
like thick syrup, add more sugar, or less if you like thin. Make sure it's
all the way dissolved and very hot. Fold in the flowers. Put on the lid.
Turn down heat so that bottom pan is just boiling - you don't want any
steam to escape from the top pan at this point (if you can help it). Let it
cook for another ten minutes. Take off heat. Let cool. Put it in a jar.

Ta-dah. You're done. You could strain out the flowers if you wanted. I
recommend keeping the syrup in the fridge. I bet you could use any edible
flower instead of/in addition to violets, but I haven't tried it.

Gulkhan - rose petal syrup
From: raghu@hocpb.ho.att.com (-K.RAGHUNANDAN)

A delicious, medicinally effective recipe using rose petals, is simple to
prepare. Called "Gulkhan" in India, this is used as a flavoring in sweet
dishes and is also eaten as such or with butter. Among its virtues are a
nice flavor, mild sweet taste, good for reducing boils, keep skin and blood
circulation clean.

Procedure: Peel fresh petals of 1 Rose flower, spread them in a container.
Sprinkle a spoon of sugar. Repeat this process each day until, the quantity
is about 250 grams (or to fill a 10 oz jar). Choose only pink/red variety
of rose which has a fine flavor. Over a period of 10-20 days the petals dry
out and the sugar layer melts to form a syrup. At this stage, take out the
entire contents and make a paste (use mortar pestle). Put this mixture in a
jar with a lid. The GULKHAN is now ready to use.

Mint syrup

From Trey Jackson, <trey@cs.berkeley.edu>:

Here's an Iranian mint syrup; it doesn't use a huge amount of mint --so dry
some to make tea with too. I don't know about canning it, but it lasts well
in the fridge for up to a year. Actually we use those German ale bottles
with the ceramic "corks".

2 cups sugar
1 cup water
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 lemon juiced
6 large sprigs of mint ( 4-5" in length)

Stir sugar and water over medium heat to boil until sugar dissolves. Add
vinegar and lemon juice and return to steady boil. Boil over medium heat
15-18 minutes ( skimming as required). Wash and drain the sprigs of mint
and add to the boiling syrup. boil one minutes. Take off heat and let cool
to room temperature. Store in closed container in refrigerator. One
traditional way to use this is to dip leaves of lettuce in it and eat. It
is also good to drink: use a little bit in a glass of cold soda water.

4.6.3 Miscellaneous sweet stuff
-----
From bobas@freenet.vancouver.bc.ca (Waldek Trafidlo)
When I was a kid in Poland years ago my neighbor would prepare a rose petal
spread by simply grinding rose petals with sugar, adjusting the proportions
to taste as she went. I believe it required some days for the taste to
settle but even during preparation it had a wonderful, "elegant" taste. She
would often use in baking, also to sweeten and flavour tea.

4.7.1 Stovetop potpourri
-----
From: clayton2@ix.netcom.com (Jeffrey Clayton):
My favorite potpourri recipe is:
dried orange peel, dried pine needles, dried mint, cinnamon sticks (broken

This is a stove top potpourri -- the kind you put in water and simmer.
Aromatherapy says this combination of scents is supposed to keep colds
away.

=====
4.7.2 Dry potpourri
-----
From: hag@aisb.ed.ac.uk (Mandy Haggith):
I've been making pot-pourri since I was about 7 and still use the same
method I used then - shoe boxes under the bed. I find that the number one
ingredient is rose petals, best of all from wild dog roses, but any smelly
rose will do. You'll need MASSES of rose petals. Lavender is also
wonderful. Pick the flowers (and herb leaves) when they're warm and dry and
smelly, stick them loosely in the shoe boxes (either mixed up or not,
depending on what you want to do with them) and stir them with a warm dry
hand a couple of times a day (or more). The petals will gradually dry out
and you can use them in pot-pourri recipes after a few weeks. Under the bed
is a good place because it is usually pretty dry, it's dark (so the petals
keep some of their colour) and the smell of the drying petals gives you
sweet dreams! I find the airing cupboard is too hot and dries the leaves
out too fast leaving them shrivelled and not so sweet smelling.

From: christopher@gn.apc.org (christopher hedley)
Ideas for Christmas:
Potpourris made by mixing 20 drops of essential oils into 2 teaspoons of
Orris root powder added to a couple of handfuls of dried flowers - remember
you can use aromatic woods as well.

=====
4.7.3 Drying flowers whole for potpourri
-----
From: diana.politika@tenforward.com (Diana Politika):
If you want to dry the peony intact, either bury it in silica gel or use a
50/50 mixture of borax and cornmeal. Leave it buried for about 2 weeks and
then tilt the container to get the mix to shift off the flower. Silica
works best, but the other is a lot cheaper. If using the borax mix, use a
small soft paintbrush to get all the dust off. I've used many of these in
arrangements and everyone goes nuts over them.

From: baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (gwen baker):
When drying flowers using silica be careful. It can speed the drying
process, but it can also cause discoloration and leave a residue behind. In
about the same amount of time the flowers can be dried naturally. Silica
does allow you to keep a flower whole or to preserve a shape. There is also
a liquid ( I think it is a glycerine) that will preserve greenery and keep
it soft and flexible.

=====
4.7.4 Bath salts
-----
From: christopher@gn.apc.org (christopher hedley)
Bath salts made by mixing 10-15 drops of essential oils 'personally
selected' in 2 teaspoons of baking soda, mixed well with 3 handfuls of sea
salt.

-----
From: Ken Fitch <docfitch@telis.org>
Here is my recipe for bath salts. It is simple and great:
Mix 2 cups Borax, 1/8 cup Sea Salt, and 1/8 cup White Clay together. Use a
fork or fingers to thoroughly mix. Shake in about an ounce of essential
oil. Cover with a cloth for at least an hour. Mix the bath salts again to
distribute the oil. Store in glass.

I hope you enjoy. You can experiment with various essential oils, or pick
up a book on aromatherapy for some recipes.

From: Henchpa@aol.com (donna):
To one box of epson salt mix 1/2 cup baking soda, 12 drops of lavender

From: JoAnne Hildebrand <hildebra@europa.umuc.edu>
While running warm water in the tub, add 1/2 cup baking soda. After filling
the tub, add a few drops of essential oil to the water, allowing it to
float on top where you can most enjoy the fragrance.

This is a most soothing bath. Easy too!

-----
From: SuseB@aol.com
These are recipes I have for bath salts and herb crystals, respectively,
although I have not tried making them myself as of yet:

Basic Bath Salts:

Put 1 cup rock salt in a container with a lid. Drop essential oil or
fragrance oil (about 20 drops) onto salt and stir or shake well. Next add
food coloring, if desired (approx. 15 drops per cup).

Herb Crystals:

1/2 c. sea salt
1/2 c. Epson salts
1/2 c. fresh herbs or flowers
1/4 c. baking soda

Blend the above in food processor. Add a few drops of food coloring. Spread
mixture onto cookie sheet to dry. Add essential oil and stir well. Try
several drops of spruce, lemon, patchouli, rosemary, ylang ylang and
eucalyptus.

Good luck, and let me know how they come out!

4.7.5 Rose beads
-----
From Kcl58@aol.com (Kacey):
First thing to do is collect the rose petals in a brown paper bag so they
don't get crushed. Optimum time is in the morning just after the dew has
dried. I guess early evening wouldn't hurt either but I don't know about
that. You can use petals that have dropped on the ground, i.e. after a rose
has 'exploded' as my kids say, but don't use any brown edges of the petals.
I just snip these off with scissors.

Second, the way I used to do this was with mortar and pestle but now I use
a mini chopper. Take the rose petals, you can mix colors as they are all
going to turn to a dark shade of ebony anyway and you can mix scents too if
they are compatible, and put them in the chopper dish and chop until very
fine. Take out that bunch and put in a glass jar and continue chopping the
rest of the petals a dish full at a time. Put them all in a glass jar and
cover loosely.

Third, the next day you can chop more fresh or slightly fresh petals then
add them to what is in the jar and process the whole bunch again. Continue
doing this for the next few days until you get at least a cup of rose petal
paste. Then start the process over with a new jar. This takes a lot of
paste.

Fourth, once you've got the paste to the consistency of playdough take a
small amount and roll it in your hands to make a ball the size of a green
pea. For this step you will also need a large sheet of cardboard, I cut up
sides of cartons from grocery store, and some rustproof straight pins. Once
you have made the 'pea' stick a straight pin through it and stick this into
the cardboard but don't let the bead touch the cardboard.

Fifth, put them in an out of the way place as they have to dry until hard.

This time varies depending on the amount of humidity in the air but we have
AC in the summer so it is usually no longer than 3 or 4 days for me.

Sixth, once they have dried polish them with a soft lintfree cloth,
actually I have found that baby diapers work well, until they have a
lustrous shine.

They will be dark, depending on the color of the petals some are very black
and some are a little shade of black but I have always mixed my Duets,
(very pink) Don Juans, (very red), and some smelly yellow ones that I don't
remember the name of.

Lastly, I use beading thread and a small eyed needle and string them in
long enough strands to go over a head, as I make them for different people,
knot the thread well, put a small dab of hot glue on the knot and you are
off and running. Every once in a while I polish them up with another rub
with a cloth, perhaps once or twice a year, and when you wear these in the
summer months the fragrance of roses is pretty strong, not like being
doused with perfume but you can tell they are there.

My girlfriend's grandmother got some made by her mother when she was a girl
of 7 or 8, she is now 92, and you can still smell the fragrance of the
roses.

A wonderful side benefit is that as you are making the paste your kitchen
will smell like roses for most of the day until you cook something with a
strong odor.

Good luck

Kacey

BTW: If you are driving through your neighborhood at the crack of dawn
collecting fallen rose petals from your neighbor's gardens, you are on
litter patrol.

4.8 Alcoholic beverages

=====
4.8.1 Wine
-----
From: Baker.325@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Gwen Baker) (who got it from
Terry Pelley on rec.winemaking)

Rose petal wine

One day before you prepare the must you should make a yeast starter:
For one gallon of wine:
4 oz. Water
1 tsp. sugar
1/4 tsp. nutrient
Pinch of citric acid
1/4 tsp. yeast
For five gallons of wine:
2 cups water
2 tbs. sugar
1/2 tsp. nutrient
1/4 tsp. citric acid
1 package of yeast

Mix all the ingredients in an appropriate size bottle and shake to combine.
Loosely cover the bottle, do not seal it tight; a cloth held in place with
a rubber band will work fine. After sitting for a day this mixture should
be fermenting and can be added to the must.

The must:
6 cups rose petals (fresh) whites removed
1/4 lb. chopped white raisins
5 3/4 cups sugar
2 tsp. yeast nutrient
2 tsp. acid blend
1 Campden Tablet (crushed)
Yeast - All purpose or Rhinewine

Boil one gallon of water and combine with rose petals, raisins, and sugar
in your primary fermenter. Allow the mixture to cool to around 75 degrees
and add yeast nutrient, acid blend and campden tablet.

From: Jeff Benjamin <benji@fc.hp.com>
I normally post this to homebrewing newsgroups or mailing lists, so for
those who are fermentationally challenged, here are a few notes on the
recipe below:

   * "Sanitized fermentation vessel" simply means a glass container, like a
     gallon juice jug, that has been sanitized with a dilute bleach
     solution. Fill the container with a mixture of two tablespoons of
     bleach per gallon of water. Let sit for 15 minutes, then drain.
     Rinsing with clean water is optional, although if you do not rinse,
     let air dry completely before using.
   * An airlock, in this case, is used to allow CO2 produced during
     fermentation to escape while not letting air (and airborne bacteria)
     in. There are a couple of different varieties; you may remember the
     S-shaped ones from high school biology. You can pick up one of these
     at your local home-brew supply shop. If there isn't such a shop in
     your area, simply cover the top of the jug with some plastic wrap and
     tie *loosely* with string, so that it's not completely sealed.
   * On yeast: again, you can get packages of dry ale yeast from your
     home-brew supply shop. The fancy varieties of liquid yeast are
     overkill; a 99-cent package of dry yeast (Red Star, Edme, M&F, etc.)
     will do just fine. Bread yeast would probably work fine, although I've
     never tried it.
   * On bottling: sanitize the bottles before filling, just like the
     fermentation vessel. If you use any auxiliary implements, like a
     funnel, it wouldn't hurt to sanitize them too. You can re-use the
     white plastic screw caps on the 2l PET bottles; sanitize them as well.

Geez, now I've probably made the whole operation sound like nuclear
physics. Well, it ain't. It is a little more like canning or pickling, in
that there are some safety concerns, although the sanitizing is more to
prevent off odors and flavors than to prevent deadly diseases. Honestly,
it's really pretty easy to do. As the homebrewers all say, "Relax, don't
worry." Have a ginger ale.

Ginger Ale

1 gallon water
1 pound white sugar (either granulated or corn will do)
1/2 oz cream of tartar
1 oz grated ginger
1 lemon
your favorite ale yeast

Boil water, stir in sugar, cream of tartar, ginger, and zest of lemon
(yellow part of peel). Cool to pitching temperature (<75F), add juice of
lemon. Transfer the whole mess to a sanitized fermentation vessel, pitch
yeast, and cap with an airlock.

Bottle after 48 hours, using strong bottles (champagne or 2l soda pop
bottles work well). Let condition at room temperature for 2-3 days, then
refrigerate.

Helpful Hints:

   * You can use more ginger (up to 3-4 oz per gallon) to get spicier
     ginger ale.
   * The jury is still out on whether it is necessary to peel the ginger. I
     peel it simply because it's easier to grate that way.
   * Don't second guess the fermentation time, and don't be worried if the
     air lock is still perking after 48 hrs. If you let it go past 48 hrs,
     you will probably end up with somewhat flat, not-very-sweet soda.
   * Please don't use regular beer bottles. Champagne bottles are much
     stronger. 2l PET bottles work very well because you can squeeze them
     to see how carbonated they are, and relieve pressure if you're
     worried.
   * Make sure you store the ginger ale in the fridge. This will help
     minimize any unwanted further fermentation.
   * Make in small quantities and drink soon. The refrigerating will
     *minimize* fermentation, not stop it, so eventually you will run the
     risk of gushers or grenades.

Ginger Beer on Dried Ground Ginger

This recipe doesn't use ginger root - but it is good! First you need a
starter . . .

Either Half fill a jam jar with tepid water, stir in one teaspoonful sugar
and one teaspoonful ground ginger, plus one teaspoonful dried yeast; or, as
above without yeast. Add one teaspoonful sugar every day and leave
uncovered in jar until fermentation starts by natural yeast spores in the
air. Then add one level teaspoonful ginger and one of sugar to starter and
stir well each day for six days. On the seventh day strain and halve the
starter (keep one half for the next batch).

To strained liquid add twelve English cups (120 fluid ounces) of cold
water, three cups sugar melted in four cups boiling water and juice of two
lemons. Bottle and cork (do not use screw tops, bottles might explode) and
keep for four days. Result is mildly alcoholic!

4.8.3 Herbal teas

For 'herbal' teas look here.

From: Rick Jarvis <JARVISR@WOOD-EMH1.ARMY.MIL>
(On uses of cinnamon basil:)
I use cinnamon basil primarily in tea. (Not many people think of basil as a
tea herb.) Cinnamon basil mixes well with mint, catnip, scullcap, etc. in
bedtime teas. I use licorice basil in combination with the above herbs, and
often throw in some anise hyssop. Lemon basil gets mixed into any number of
lemony mixes, that also incorporate lemon balm, lemon verbena, lemon grass,
and lemon catnip.
If you enjoy herb teas (actually, technically they're infusions, because
they don't contain any real tea), try using some basil.

(after being prompted for more info:)
I do have some advice on developing your own recipes. Take an herb that
seems like it would make good tea, make some tea and try it. If you like
it, keep using it. After you have tried a few herbs that you enjoy, try
mixing them. If there's an herb with certain properties that you want to
use (such as catnip or scullcap for a sedative effect at bedtime), but you
dont like the taste, mix it with an herb you like that will mask the
flavor. The important thing is to keep records of what you put into the
blends that you like, so you can reproduce them when you run out.

I make most of my herb teas from dried herbs, although I do make some sun
teas using fresh herbs combined with pekoe tea bags. To start, use what you
have available. Experiment some, too. (I wouldn't have thought to used
flavored basil for tea until my wife tried it and we liked it.) Some of the
herbs we use or have experimented with in tea are various mints, flavored
basils (lemon, cinnamon, licorice), anise hyssop, lemon verbena, calamint,
catmint, catnip, lemon catnip, lemon grass, chamomile, sage, pineapple
sage, lemon balm, clary sage, scullcap, sweet marjoram, and thyme. There
are *LOTS* of others. Have fun!

   * Equal parts of sage, thyme, marjoram, oregano and chamomile is nice
     and it will help you fall asleep too.
   * Also: 5 oz dried red rosebuds, 2 oz dried balm, 1oz dried rosemary.
   * Also mix in equal parts: balm leaves, rosemary, lavender, spearmint,
     and cloves. Personally I like a little less cloves but it's up to you.

Enjoy!

4.9.1 Gazpacho
-----
White Gazpacho
From: phuyett@CCTR.UMKC.EDU (Donna Beach)

one qt buttermilk
2 tbs. cider or herb vinegar
1 tbs. sugar or honey
4-6 drops of Tabasco or one teaspoon white pepper
2 green onions
1 small sweet red bell pepper, diced
1-2 cloves garlic
2 stalks celery, cubed
1 large cucumber, Peeled & seeded
1 tbs. fresh dill chopped,
1 tbs. fresh tarragon, chopped.

Put garlic and white parts of onion into food processor and chop. Then add
cuke and celery with vinegar and process till fairly smooth. Combine
buttermilk, sugar and white pepper or Tabasco. Slice green parts of onion.
Combine all ingredients and chill before serving. May be garnished with
chopped red leaf lettuce or chopped tomatoes.

4.9.2 Pesto

Also see Using / preserving basil, 2.1.3, and Freezing your herbs, 4.4.
-----
From: jnilsen@minerva.cis.yale.edu (jnilsen)
1 cup fresh Basil leaves, tightly packed
2-3 cloves garlic
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup pine nuts
1/4 cup olive oil

Process (or finely chop and mix) all but oil. Slowly add oil. Use.

-----
From: phuyett@cctr.umkc.edu (Donna Beach)
I never really follow a recipe when I make pesto. I usually put 4-6 cloves
of garlic in the food processor with 1/4 cup of olive oil and a couple of
tablespoons of herb vinegar and then chop the garlic. Then I add at least
3-4 cups packed fresh sweet basil leaves and 3-4 tablespoons of ground
almonds. Some people use ground pine nuts. And 1/4 cup or more of grated
parmesan cheese (I like it fresh best). All this gets processed till the
basil is chopped fine.

I have seen this basic pest recipe to include one-to-several peeled
tomatoes--which is a great way to use up an abundance of tomatoes from your
garden.

Later in the year when there's not as much sweet basil, you can put parsley
into the mix. I have even seen a winter "pesto" made with fresh sage, but
to me, it's not pesto without fresh sweet basil, with or without the
tomatoes.

-----
From: wfink@iastate.edu (Ruth J Fink-Winter)
This is one of my favorite pestos.

Asian Pesto

1 clove garlic
1" piece ginger root, peeled
2 tsp. toasted sesame seeds
2 bunches cilantro, stems removed
1 tsp. soy sauce
1 tsp. mirin or apple juice
juice of 1 lime (about 3 tsp.)
1/4 tsp. Tabasco sauce
3 tsp. sesame oil (or less)
8 oz. soba noodles, cooked

Turn on food processor. With motor running, drop garlic and ginger into
feed tube. Add seeds and cilantro; pulse til finely chopped. Add soy sauce,
mirin or juice, and then slowly add oil in steady stream until pesto is
desired consistency. Toss with hot noodles.

-----
From: stewball@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu (ANDREAS GUENIN)

Sundried Tomato Pesto

1/2 cup blanched sundried tomatoes
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 Tbs. tomato paste
3/4 cup olive oil
1/2 tsp. dried thyme
2 cloves of garlic
1/4 cup toasted pine nuts

Combine everything except the oil in a food processor, and then slowly add
the olive oil while pureeing to the proper consistency.

-----
From: gcook@chem.Stanford.EDU (Gregory R. Cook)
For a low fat (or no fat) alternative, cut down (or eliminate) the olive
oil and add fresh squeezed lemon juice until you get the right consistency.
Personally, I like to use a little bit of olive oil for the texture. Also,
walnuts are often substituted for pine nuts.

-----
From: DonW1948@aol.com

Pesto (Sorrel-Chive Herb Paste)

1 c Sorrel
4 tbs. Shallots; finely minced
4 tbs. Pine nuts; ground
3 tbs. Parsley; chopped
3 tbs. Chives; chopped
Grated peel of 4 oranges
1/4 Onions, red; chopped
1 tbs. Mustard, dry
1 tsp. Salt
1 tsp. Pepper, black
1 pn Pepper, cayenne
3/4 c Oil. olive

Wash the sorrel and dry it well, by hand or in a salad spinner. Chop the
sorrel coarsely, and again squeeze away any liquid. Blend the sorrel,
shallots, pine nuts, parsley, chives, orange peel and onion in a food
processor or blender. (If using a blender, make sure these ingredients are
already finely chopped.) Add dry mustard, salt, pepper and cayenne, and mix
again. SLOWLY drizzle in the oil while the blade is moving. Transfer to
tempered glass jars and store in refrigerator (for up to 8 to 10 weeks) or
in the freezer for up to a year.

NOTES: Sorrel's peak season is summer, although you can find hothouse
sorrel year round in some stores. You may reduce the amount of orange peel
by 1/4 or 1/2 if you'd like to emphasize the sorrel or other flavors.
Walnuts or almonds may be substituted for the pine nuts.

From mflesch@mail.coin.missouri.edu (Mary A. Flesch):
Yet another pesto idea. I am always trying to lower the fat in my diet, so
last summer I tried "Rosie's Pesto" from "In the Kitchen with Rosie"
(Oprah's cook) mostly because it had no oil in it (1 1/2 c fresh basil
leaves, 2-5 garlic cloves to taste, 1/4 c pine nuts, 1/4 c fresh parmesan
and 1/4 cup lemon juice). However, I only had bottled lemon juice (BIG
MISTAKE, I highly recommend fresh) and it turned out way too lemon-y. So I
diluted it with ricotta, and it turned out excellent over fettucini! I
think it would also be a good mixture to stuff manicotti with. The mixture
was approximately 1 tablespoon pesto to 1/4 c manicotti.

> ... pesto turning brown...

From: Xiaoyan Ma <xma@haas.berkeley.edu>
I grow sweet basils to make pesto. But for some reason my pesto always
turns brown (the surface only) within 2 minutes.

This is the recipe I have:
1/2 cup chopped basil
3 tbs. parmesan cheese
4 tbs. olive oil
2 tbs. pinenut
1 clove of garlic
salt
I put 3 times of each ingredient into the blender and blend it for 2
minutes then store the pesto in a jar. I have tried a few times, the same
thing happens each time. The pesto tastes good but looks awful. When I mix
the pesto with pasta, the whole thing turns brown right away. Can someone
tell me what causes the problem?

From: macrakis@osf.org (Stavros Macrakis)
Pesto (like guacamole) turns brown by oxidation. One way to prevent
oxidation is to pour a thin layer of oil on top, or cover with plastic wrap
(touching the pesto).
Your pesto will probably also turn out better if you use a mortar and
pestle instead of a blender. In fact, even a food processor seems to work
better than a blender. And the traditional cheese to use is not parmesan,
but pecorino sardo (Sardinian ewe's milk cheese).
Unfortunately, good pecorino sardo is hard to get in the US, so you might
have to substitute pecorino romano, also known as just "romano".

> I would like to hear from others about alternatives for using pesto.

From: wlgardne@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Wendi L Gardner)
I grow lots of basil and make tons of pesto. what to do with all of that
pesto? yes pasta, yes bread, but other fun things to do with pesto...

   * smash it into cream cheese (the ratio of pesto to cream cheese that I
     prefer is 1:3, but you can go more or less, obviously.) add garlic,
     some plumped (blanched) sun dried tomatoes, whatever else you fancy -
     yum!
   * toss pesto with white beans and vidalia onions, serve this concoction
     hot on a bed of fresh spinach.
   * mix pesto with vegetable broth, toss in whatever veggies you have in
     the fridge and some macaroni, (I like broccoli, carrots, cauliflower,
     and rotini for this) and you have soup.
   * find the juiciest beefsteak tomato you can...slice in half, slather
     with pesto, broil till bubbly. messy, but with a good quality
     tomato--- more than worth the mess!
   * fill mushroom caps with pesto plus a cheese (the pesto cream cheese
     mixture in #1 is good for this) sprinkle with bread crumbs and broil.

Make pizza with a layer of pesto on the crust, then mozzarella cheese, then
dotted with feta. Try using reduced-fat mozzarella, and scattering black
olives & fresh tomatoes on top!

From: rscw081@uacsc1.albany.edu (Sarah G.):

   * Pesto and potatoes: On baked potatoes, swirled into mashed potatoes,
     mixed into homefried potatoes, used as a dipping sauce for French
     fries.
   * Make soup and swirl a spoonful into each bowl before serving.
   * Blend the pesto with vinegar and oil, or your favorite vinaigrette,
     and use as salad dressing
   * Make into soup... sautee some veggies, add broth and pesto, and simmer
     for pesto soup.
   * Thin it and use as a marinade for tofu, potatoes and veggies, then
     grill.
   * Use it for garlic bread filling (or is that what you meant?) Or you
     could use it to smear over homemade bread before it comes out of the
     oven as a glaze
   * Sliced ripe tomatoes layered on a plate with pesto, and fresh
     waterpacked mozzarella.
   * It's easy to make a dairy free pesto. Instead of using cheese, either
     use a mild flavored miso paste or SoyMage pretend grated cheese, which
     is completely vegan (no casein). I usually just leave the cheese out
     altogether, letting the flavor of the basil, garlic, olive oil and
     nuts show through.

From: norrisj@boalt.berkeley.edu (Jennifer Norris)
I make a potato salad with it. Instead of the usual mayonnaise, I add
pesto. Besides potatoes, I add fresh snap peas, green onions, and if I want

Herbs de Provence

1 tsp thyme
1 tsp summer savory
1/2 tsp lavender
1/4 tsp rosemary
1/2 tsp oregano or basil 1/4 tsp sage

Herbs de Provence is made up of every herb that grows easily in the south
of France. The mix is best if made with dried herbs as when used and
cooking is longer than 20 minutes; fresh herbs tend to lose their flavour
while dried holds it.
This blend is wonderful mixed into 1/4 lb. of butter. It is great in soups,
on potatoes, on rice, pasta, fish and bread. Try it on an oiled chicken
that you then bake. Or make oven fries with it! Yummm.
It is not easy to find the lavender so you may have to ask around a bit for
that ingredient. You want an edible version that has not been sprayed with
any chemicals.
Try preparing roasted vegetables using the Herbs de Provence blend. Cut up
red peppers, green and yellow, too, eggplant, zucchini and summer squash,
and leeks (shallots or any onion) into bite sized pieces. Pour some
extra-virgin olive oil (just enough to oil the veggies so the herbs have
something to "stick" to) over the veggies along with 2 tsp. of the herbs de
provence blend (that has been crushed between your palms as you let it fall
into the veggies). Stir to mix the oil and the herbs evenly. Put into a 9 x
13 inch pan in a 400 degree f. oven (or 375 F if your oven runs hot). Let
roast for 15 to 20 minutes. This is delicious and impressive! And so EASY!

Fines Herbs

1 sprig fresh parsley, minced
1 sprig fresh tarragon, minced
1 sprig fresh chervil, minced
1 fresh chive, minced

Pull leaves off of herbs by pulling in the opposite direction they are
growing in. Chop all finely in a food processor. Use in classic French
foods. This is good in vegetable soups, potatoes, butters.
Add 2 recipes of this to 1 cup of unsalted butter. Blend and use of
potatoes, rice, pasta, fish, or bread.

Bouquet Garni

3 sprigs fresh parsley
1 sprig fresh thyme
1 dried or 2 fresh bay leaf

Wrap these together with kitchen twine. Add to recipes during the cooking
but be sure to remove before serving the food! Good in soups, stews,
chicken and dumplings, and in goulash.
Use this to make a delicious Tuscan White Bean dish: Heat a large saucepan
and add some olive oil. Add one chopped leek or some yellow onions and
shallots. Saute 'til soft and then add six cans of white beans, 5 to 6 roma
tomatoes, 1-1/2 cups of chicken broth and one bouquet de garni. Cook at
simmer for 1/2 hour or longer.

Garam Masala

2 tsp cardamon seeds
2 tsp coriander seeds
1-1/2 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp peppercorns
1/2 tsp whole cloves
1/2 whole nutmeg (you will grate a part of it)
2 inch piece of a cinnamon stick, broken up

This is a northern India blend. The mixes are slightly stronger in the
southern section. Bake the seeds in an oven until they are darker in
colour. Use a 350-degree oven and keep close watch on them. Put the seeds
and all the remaining spices into a food processor. Grind it finely.
Use this blend in vegetable stew to which you have added some apple juice
or apple cider, try with potatoes, vegetable stock, over rice, in quick
breads such as pumpkin and apple.
