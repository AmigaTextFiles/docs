We are talking about these four beloved characters:

		ä, ö, ü and ß

So, with the aid of this document all of you out there can die a little bit wiser.

	The German special characters divide up into the

	@{"Umlauts" link DREI} {ä, ö and ü) and the
	@{"Eszett" link VIER} (ß), which is somewhat different.

	Umlauts (ä, ö, ü)

The word Umlaut can be translated as sound-shift. Actually, from the "phoneme" point of view, the Umlauts are only versions of their corresponding plain vowels.
However, litterally, the Umlauts are unique characters! So, just leaving the dots will change the literal value of the character, making a word another word!
Best example for this are the cities Münster and Munster, apx. 200 km apart from each other.

	Expansion of the Umlauts

When no dots are available, Umlauts can be expanded to their "uncompressed" versions. See this:

		ä expands to ae
		ö expands to oe
		ü expands to ue

So, with these rules, you are able to differ between Muenster and Munster! But normally, every Amiga-User has got access to the Umlauts by pressing alt-k and then the desired vowel.

	History

The expansion rules have got historical reasons. Copyists in the middle-aged saved space by first superscibing the "e", then making dots of it. See the @{"figure" link "umlaut.ilbm"} for the evolution of the Umlauts.

@node VIER
@title "Main Article, Eszett"
@toc main

	Eszett (ß)

Yes, this letter is the combination of "s" and "z". The shape of Eszett turned out in the middle-aged.
Imagine the old, gothic character for "s" as like an f without dash. And imagine further the gothic charachter for "z" a little bit like a hanging "3". Now if you put them closely enough together, you may get an idea of what is the result.
You may also consult the @{"figure" link "Eszett.ilbm"} to see clearly.

	Expansion of the Eszett

As of every Amiga-User should have access to the Eszett by pressing alt-s, it can be expanded into it's "uncompressed" form. But now: Do NOT think the expansion of the Eszett is "sz", no! It is "ss"!
Do not ask me why, but Eszett has to be expanded into double-s.

By the way: The Eszett is always a lower-case letter, a capital Eszett does not exist, as no word exists that begins with Eszett. So, if you up-case: expand! I think not even the locale.library is aware/capable of this!
