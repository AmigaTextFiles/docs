 =============

 Welcome to the first (and only) Duran Duran guide.  I'm so glad you took
 the time to view the guide and I'm sure you'll find something of interest,
 even if you don't like DD.  The guide has expanded greatly over the last
 year (see @{" Guide History " link "Guide History" 0}) to offer everything you could ever need to know
 about the group.

 The whole idea of the guide was to give non-internet people the chance to
 view the same information the internet sites have, but using Amigaguide.
 You will notice while viewing the guide that some material has been taken
 from actual web sites, a sort of 'Best of the Net'.  In these cases the
 info has been reformatted and rewritten but the original source has been
 quoted for reference.  Also included are a number of articles which offer
 extra information such as reviews and a collectables list.

 The guide has been designed to be as user friendly as possible. Pressing
 @{"Contents" link "" 0} on the guide bar will ALWAYS take you to the title page.
 You may also use the @{"< Browse " link "" 0} and @{"Browse >" link "" 0} buttons to navigate, and using
 these will usually take you to the title page of your current area. The
 only exception to this is when viewing Duran lyrics (will cycle through
 A - Z) or when viewing Duran albums (will cycle through in chronological
 order). Finally, you can press the @{" Index " link "INDEXNODE" 0} button to view a complete list
 of all the pages presented within the guide. If you have any trouble
 viewing this guide in your screen mode, simply change the Overscan Prefs
 on your workbench, and change the screen fonts using the Font Prefs
 program.

 If you have any comments or additions you would like to make, please read
 the @{" Author " link "Author" 0} section for more information.

 Guide History
 =============


  1/8/96 (V0.5)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 After seeing a PinkFloyd guide from another user, I decided to make my
 own guide for my favourate group (simple as that).  I already had a large
 collection of albums so I had an ample base to start with.  The only
 question was that of appreciation.  If there aren't any fans out there
 that will appreciate this, I don't need to go on with it.  This is why I
 have started with this Tryware guide to see if I get any positive feedback
 for the full version 1.0.  This version is a bit thin on the ground as far
 as huge chunks of information go. I mean, would you type out all the
 lyrics from all the albums in your collection for nothing?  No, I think
 not.  So as soon as a few fans give me some support, I will complete it
 before you know whats hit you!


  5/9/96 (V1.0)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Having got this far with it, I don't really mind if its unappreciated. 
 After seeing the WWW pages on the internet devoted solely to Duran Duran,
 I've decided to compile a virtual WWW site for all non-internet users.
 Having used up all the local information I could include into the pages,
 the guide now includes areas similar to ones found on real WWW pages e.g
 the @{"FAQs" link "faq1-misc" 0} and a @{"WWW page list" link "electric-fanzines" 0}.  This will expand the whole guide and it
 will take several more months to finish.

 
  15/9/96 (V1.3)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Have decided to include all albums and @{"lyrics" link "Lyrics" 0} Duran have released.

 
  10/10/96 (V1.5)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Guide now includes 4 FAQS, full revised history, @{"fanzine sections" link "mainstream-fanzines" 0} and
 most lyrics are now present.  Will release full thing within the month.

 
  25/10/96 (V1.7)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Took time to include full WWW page and fanzine section. Added new @{"video" link "Videos" 0}
 and @{"Guide History" link "Guide History" 0} areas, and generally cleaned up the guide.  Now @{"Areana" link "Areana" 0}
 and @{"Arcadia" link "Arcadia.al" 0} albums present but no lyrics yet for Arcadia. Now includes
 lyric look-up table and mainstream fanzine sections.  @{"Profiles" link "profiles" 0} of band
 members present, not Steve.

 
  30/10/96 (V1.9)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I now use a new Amigaguide maker to do the job so I've managed to get a
 lot further with it.  More lyrics have been included for all albums. Major
 reshuffle of internal docs into a form of order.  Fixed glitches with the
 history file and other things.  Now considering a Rio mod file to be
 included with the package so you can play it while viewing.  Now the guide
 is in its final stages, also thought about including info on other 80's
 new wave bands like The Human League, Heaven 17, ABC, Spandau Ballet and
 Simple Minds.

 
  2/11/96 (V2.0)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Yet another month and still not finished.  Duran section all but complete
 except for a few song lyrics.  Tried the Rio mod but the final version was
 2.5MB in size so had to leave it out of the guide.  Major reshuffle of the
 pages so all the Duran stuff is on its own menu.  Have decided to go ahead
 with the other band stuff to make guide more interesting to other people.
 Will have to include a few 'Back to menu' buttons to make it more user
 friendly. All the stops will now be pulled out for a December release.


  7/11/96 (V2.3)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Completed all the Duran lyrics I have available so Duran section
 officially completed.  Also completed all the other bands lyrics and some
 historys. Just a few band historys to do and a final tidy up before
 release.


  18/11/96 (V2.5)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Adjusted DD area a little to include latest info on the group.  Also
 altered a few lyrics on the "@{"Notorious" link "Notor" 0}" album to make them more readable.
 Have still got to finish 3 historys for the New Wave area, and to add
 Frankie Goes To Hollywood to the bands listed.  On cource for a December
 release.


  28/11/96 (V2.7)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Now the New Wave section looks bigger than the Duran section so have
 included two special Questions and Answers pages for @{"John" link "Interview-JT" 0} and @{"Warren" link "Interview-WC" 0}.
 This will pad the whole lot out a bit and give the reader more insite
 into their private lives.  And yes, V2.9 WILL be the final version and
 should be out December 1996.


  7/12/96 (V2.9)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Like all projects of this type, its not a matter of what to include, but
 what to leave out!  To help illustrate Durans History and Member
 Profile areas, a selection of @{"mini biography's" link "Bio.menu" 0} have been included in the
 Duran section.  These should provide useful reading material for anyone
 interested in the members private lives.  A selection of pictures also
 accompany these, and I couldn't resist making them into an area of their
 own.. the @{"Art Gallery" link "Gallery.menu" 0}.


  15/12/96 (V2.11)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Minor spell check surgery on a number of sections and fixed a few rogue
 buttons.  Even December release now unlikely but final touches are
 definitely going on.  Proof read will take quite a while.


  5/1/97 (V2.13)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Final Release (or maybe not.....) *


  6/1/97 - 5/4/97 (V2.14 - V3.11)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Proceeded with work on Duranguide for a few months after the release of
 version 2.13 to expand the guide and make it more Duran based.
 Unfortunarly, versions 2.14 - 3.11 all disappeared when my hard drive
 gave up in April 97.  Features the new V3 guide boasted included: Two
 joined interviews with John Taylor, a Nick Rhodes TV Mania interview, a
 massive 20 page discography including every single release the band has
 ever released, in every country (better then Kimberly Blessings..), extra
 guides on how to collect items, what to look for and how to take care of
 it all.  Also up-to-date news, reviews, indepth coverage of my own
 collection in brief list and expanded forms and even an expanded art
 gallery section, all of which has gone to the wind.


  6/8/97 (V2.14)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 After a bit of a break, I finally decided to forgive my old Quantum hard
 drive and continue work on the guide.  V2.13 was the last release and was
 easily available from a number of BBS's (such as Dave Place), and from
 CUCD 11.  Fixed a few things up like The Reflex and Rio buttons not
 working on the Lyrics page.  Before I try to include any of my old
 material (if I do at all), I'm going straight on with the new stuff. This
 includes new songs being included within the guide as they appear, such
 as Out Of My Mind and Electric Barbarella.


  10/8/97 (V2.15)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Cleaning up the guide ready for the new album when it is released.
 Updated the song list of the new album and changed the previous albums
 to remove all Bonus Songs not directly relating to the release.  Again
 removed the Other Bands section to make the guide Duran only.  Added
 @{" Stop Dead " link "STOP DEAD" 0} and @{" Silva Halo " link "SILVA HALO" 0} to Lyrics page.


  12/8/97 (V2.16)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added new items to the menu inc.  Articles page, collectables and a few
 more things.  Completed 4 articles already, with the bulk of work still
 to do on 'my collection', 'history line' and 'what they said' articles.
 Also added Powerstation to the album menu and added a few of their songs
 for lyrics (will not appear on the lyric base). @{" El Diablo " link "EL DIABLO" 0} finally
 entered into lyric base and a few more intrumentals added to the
 @{" intrumental " link "+INSTRUMENTAL" 0} page.  


  18/8/97 (V2.17/18)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added @{" Violance of Summer (story mix) " link "VIOLANCE OF SUMMER(STORY)" 0} lyrics to lyrics base and added a
 few more pieces to articles menu.  Updated a few of the albums on the
 album menu to include more information and updated the Introduction and
 Author pages.  Finally typed up @{" My Collection " link "A.My collection" 0} in brief form (won't
 bother expanding it) and have included a piece on my fav Duran magazine
 Medazzaland.  Still waiting for new album and single to be released before
 I can get / review them.  Nicks interview was also included to Duran menu
 again.


  26/8/97 (V2.19)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added a few more articles in and changed a few lyrics to fit the actual
 words of the song.  Also added a few part-song lyrics including @{" Shotgun " link "SHOTGUN" 0}
 and @{" Burning The Ground. " link "BURNING THE GROUND" 0}  Included the @{" Starting Your Own Collection " link "A.Starting your collection" 0}
 section and copied the button from the articles menu to the main menu for
 ease of use.


  5/9/97 (V2.20/21)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Took time to add full @{" Taking Care Of Your Collection " link "A.Taking care of collection" 0} section and a few
 more articles.  Also changed the lyrics to @{" Out Of My Mind " link "OUT OF MY MIND" 0} to match the
 actual words of the song.  The last parts of vertion 2 are now nearly in
 place, just to add two more songs to the lyric base and complete the
 articles section.


  9/9/97 (V2.22)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Finally got around to adding all Powerstations lyrics to their album page
 and changing them to fit the actual songs.  Also added all John Taylors
 work on the @{" Feelings Are Good And Other Lies " link "Feelings Are Good.al" 0} album, which is only fair
 as he was with Duran at the time.  Just need to incorporate the major
 Discography section again to make the guide Version 3.


  12/9/97 (V2.23)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added @{" Pen Pals " link "A.Penpal" 0} and @{" Related Artists " link "A.Related Artists" 0} areas to articles menu and
 typed in a few related lyrics like @{" Too Shy " link "REL.TOO SHY" 0} and @{" Kiss Me " link "REL.KISS ME" 0}.  This may
 give the guide more scope but I cannot include more in this area or
 it will become an 80's general guide.


  17/9/97 (V3.1)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Finally we get back to V3.  The @{" Discography " link "Discography.menu" 0} is now in (but not updated),
 and so is the @{" Books and Magazines " link "Book & magazines" 0} section.  Also managed to get the
 lyrics to finish off my lyric base.  These were @{" God " link "GOD" 0} and @{" Fame " link "FAME" 0}, and so
 I just need the new songs to be released so I can release this guide.


  23/9/97 (V3.2)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Just adding a few more articles to finish off the guide.  Tony Hadley of
 Spandau Bellet fame has just released a new album featuring his version
 of Save A Prayer (with Simon as the backing singer), so have included
 a @{" review " link "A.Hadley" 0} of this.  Also changed the Books and Magazines slightly and
 added a few more descriptions to the video section.  Still waiting for
 Medazzaland to be released.


  27/9/97 (V3.3)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 With just two more articles to write before V3 can recieve the full
 distribution treatment, a few small changes and one large change has been
 implemented.  First off, a full index has been included for use with the
 @{" index " link "INDEXNODE" 0} button. This should (should..) included every page of information
 the guide contains, making it easier to find those deeply hidden pages.
 The Introduction and author pages have undergone changes, and the
 Medazzaland Magazine review has been updated.  A new icon has also been
 added to the archive which will change how the link buttons look.  This
 is because I use HTML style buttons, so I've given the user the chance to
 use these or the older style buttons instead.


  3/10/97 (V3.4)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 A full @{" History Line " link "A.History line" 0} has been included in this version, which took quite
 a while to convert, append and update from the original HTML versions.
 My collection page has been updated and a few spellings corrected.  Will
 give the whole guide a spell check once all articles are completed.


  11/11/97 (V3.6)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added lyrics for @{" The Model " link "REL.THE MODEL" 0} and @{" Kiss Me " link "REL.KISS ME" 0} to related artists list and
 fixed the browse buttons on a number of pages.  Also moved my poem into
 the Poem Inspiration article to hide it a bit more and deleted the
 What That Used To Say section.  Also included sub-lyrics for @{" Decadance " link "DECADANCE" 0}.
 Will have to import Medazzaland from Japan as UK ver now sheduled for
 Feb 98 release.


  24/11/97 (V3.7)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Went back to an early idea about playing DD music while viewing the guide.
 A MOD or MED file is just too big to be included in the archive and a
 player would also take up space.  I came accross a collection of @{" MIDI " link "Playmidi" 0}
 files by accident and have included one (to be played via a pre-installed
 GMPlay).  This had to be included on the Articles menu because it deosn't
 really fit-in with anything else.


  29/4/98 (V3.8)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Finally got enough inspiration to finish this guide off!  Yes I'm still
 a major Duran fan/collector but simply hadn't the time. First updated
 the bio's to add the latest events and totally overhauled the  History
 file to add more information on Medazzaland etc.  Updated all the
 lyrics for the Medazzaland album to make sure they are correct.  Added
 the bit about John leaving wherever possible.  Discovered a problem with
 the new Amigaguide buttons with WB3 so will have to fix.

 
  1/5/98 (V3.9)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Updated the @{" Discography " link "Discography.menu" 0} pages a bit to include more Medazzaland stuff.
 Finally added the @{" Med review " link "A.Madazz.review" 0} in the articles bit.  A few cosmetic changes
 to the Albums information and an update to my collection page.


  8/5/98 (V3.10)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 All links should now be working and the Whats Happening Now page has been
 updated as much as I can.  The index node should also have a number of
 new links.  Changed the address of Medazzaland Magazine in the mags area.
 Now only Amigaguide button thing to sort and a short review of the new B5
 homepage before final release.


  12/5/98 (V3.11)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Included reviews of the @{" Duran web page " link "A.World Wide Wannabes" 0} and B5's new look page.  Also
 added a review of the Capitol split called @{" Capitol Offence " link "A.Capitol Offence" 0}.  Changed
 and updates a few of the articles.  Finally got the @{" Whats Happening Now " link "What_happening_now?" 0}
 page up to date and made it stand out on the menu.  Also moved the
 articles page button to the top of the menu as this is an important link.
 The new 1997 tours have been added to the @{" History Line " link "A.History line" 0} area.  Removed
 the quit button on the main screen and the pen pals page from articles
 (as I simply don't have time anymore).  Most of the articles look pretty
 old now compaired to the new material but the guide is about ready for
 release.


  14/5/98 (V3.12e)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Quickly included an article on the Eurovision Song contest and cleaned up
 a new bugs and spelling mistakes before release. Spent two+ hours spell
 checking the whole doc - only for the machine to crash and so lost
 everything, all remaining spelling errors will have to remain!

 * Second release (and definately final!) *

 MAKING HISTORY
 ==============

 Duran Duran started life in the mind of a young college student named John
 Taylor, studying at art college in the latter half of the 1970's. Together
 with his friend Nick Rhodes (a DJ at the Rum Runners night club at the
 time) they decided to form a new band.  And so they formed RAF, a two
 member group who played at several clubs and events.  Obviously, this
 wasn't going to make them big names so they changed there name to Duran
 Duran and advertised for new members.  Roger Taylor and Andy Wickett were
 the first to arrive and it wasn't long before Roger decided to stay with
 the band and so provide his bass guitar skills. After Andy left, the space
 for a new drummer was left vacant. John decided to advertise the position
 in Melody Maker Magazine and the advert was answered by Andy Taylor, a
 keen drummer from North Humberside.

 Together they produced a small number of songs including a four track CD
 called Duran Duran.  This didn't sell too well and is as rare today as it
 was then.  Obviously it was time to get in new talent to give the group
 that extra push. The group had all the elements of a successful setup
 (Lead Guitar, Bass guitar, Drums, Synths), all they needed now was a good
 vocalist.

 John and Nick interviewed for the position and turned down many hopefuls.
 Then along came Simon Le Bon , wearing a pair of pink leopard skin pants
 and blew them away.  Simon was quickly installed into the group and sang
 Roger Taylors @{" RIO " link "RIO" 0} and @{" GIRLS ON FILM." link "GIRLS ON FILM" 0} It was apparent that Simon was
 the right choice for the band, especially as Simon already had a number
 of new songs he had written (in the form of poetry) and was comfortable
 writing lyrics to existing music.

 It didn't take long before the group made their first hit singles, these
 included @{" GIRLS ON FILM " link "GIRLS ON FILM" 0} and @{" PLANET EARTH." link "PLANET EARTH" 0} Due to the success of these
 records, a new album was quickly on the way, simply called @{" DURAN DURAN " link "Duran" 0},
 and giving them new found fame in the pop world.
 
 Due to the success of their first album, the group found themselves on a
 number of TV and radio shows including MTV, Whistle Test and Top Of The
 Pops, and cleared the path for the first follow up album, called @{" RIO " link "Rio.al" 0}.
 This new album has a more outgoing pop style and spawned numerous hits
 such as @{" RIO " link "RIO" 0}, @{" HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF " link "HUNGRY LILE A WOLF" 0} and @{" SAVE A PRAYER " link "SAVE A PRAYER" 0}.  This quickly
 shot them back up the charts and established them as a major new group of
 the 80's. It also gave them a chance to try out different types of music
 and new music styles on their audience, to great success. Fans flocked to
 buy their new CD's and the press were quick to laugh at there punky style
 and outlandish hairstyles.

 As the 80's rolled on, there success' climbed the charts and more albums
 were released.  By 1983 there popularity was such that their next album
 released to the eager public,@{" SEVEN AND THE RAGGED TIGER " link "Tiger" 0} went straight to
 the top of the charts.  The album also saw such hits as @{" THE REFLEX " link "THE REFLEX" 0} and
 @{" UNION OF THE SNAKE " link "UNION OF THE SNAKE" 0} at the top for quite a while. Together the group had
 managed to create a stunning lineup of songs which impressed audiences
 from all parts of the world. Fan clubs sprang up in many countries and
 sellout tours were quickly arranged.  Their earlier 1981 success album
 @{" DURAN DURAN " link "Duran" 0} was re-released under the same name but their more recent
 1983 hit @{" IS THERE SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW? " link "IS_THERE_SOMETHING.." 0} also appeared on the album
 to give it more selling power. A live album, @{" ARENA " link "areana-album" 0} was also released
 the following year, to much the same less publicity and success, including
 their No.1 hit @{" WILD BOYS " link "WILD BOYS" 0}.

 During 1985, John Barry commissioned them to sing the score for the Bond
 movie @{" A VIEW TO A KILL. " link "A VIEW TO A KILL" 0} This rocked the charts, sending them to #2 in
 the UK, #1 in the US, and gave them many new fans.

 At this point both Roger and Andy Taylor decided to pursue other interests
 away from the group.  Roger left straight away and bought a farm in
 Glostershire while Andy returned to help produce a few more songs before
 he left the scene.  John was also unsatisfied with the direction the group
 was taking and so moved off and formed another group with Andy, Robert
 Palmer and Tony Thompson (formerly drummer in Chic) called Powerstation.
 Except for a hit single, Powerstation never became as strong as everyone
 had hoped forcing Andy to move into a solo career and John returned to
 Duran Duran. The group now needed a drummer to replace Roger and a new
 guitarist to replace Andy. This opened the door for new members to join
 the band and so Steve Ferrone, a drummer, became a much welcomed addition.

 Nile Rogers, who had also helped with earlier hits such as @{" WILD BOYS " link "WILD BOYS" 0}
 arrived to help the group through a further three albums before Nile also
 departed. Another new face was Warren Cuccurullo, a lead guitarist, who
 played with them on many songs through the mid 80's but was not seem as a
 major group member until he fully joined in 1990.

 Using a new funk/pop formula the remaining original group members produced
 the @{" NOTORIOUS " link "Notor" 0} album which failed to live up to their expectations
 but still did well, including the chart successes @{" NOTORIOUS " link "NOTORIOUS" 0} and
 @{" SKIN TRADE " link "SKIN TRADE" 0}. Yet their popularity continued to decline.  This didn't stop
 their  progress and a much darker style came in the from of their 1988
 @{" BIG THING " link "BigThing" 0} album which failed to do particularly well, dispite
 many strong songs.
 
 And so, as the 80's came to a close Duran Duran decided to make a come
 back. They released their @{" DECADE " link "Decade" 0} album to attract the old fans back and
 this was a collection of their 80's chart hits.  It sold quite well as
 a best-of album but seemed to enforce the fact the Duran had been seem as
 an 80's video band.  Because of this, their 1990 @{" LIBERTY " link "Liberty.al" 0}album became
 their least popular album to date and sank off the end of the charts.

 This was a major setback and proved that the band had lost many fans over
 decade and their new material simply wasn't attracting attention anymore.
 Only the loyal fans stayed together as the rest of the world removed
 Duran to their 80's memories.  Rumous of a breakup were rife and yet
 new material in the form of @{" ORDINARY WORLD " link "ORDINARY WORLD" 0} was still in deep production
 and held the group together.

 1993 saw a new vigour in Duran production as the band knew that way they
 wanted to go.  Moving away from the harder style of @{" LIBERTY " link "Liberty.al" 0} and moving
 onto a more thoughful, multi-cultural level.  Finally a new album appeared
 and the single @{" ORDINARY WORLD " link "ORDINARY WORLD" 0} was given enough promotion to get noticed.
 This was the fuel Duran needed and following singles @{" COME UNDONE " link "COME UNDONE" 0} and
 @{" TOO MUCH INFORMATION " link "TOO MUCH INFO" 0} were released to great success and the album
 (Commonly known as the @{" WEDDING ALBUM " link "Wedding" 0}) became their 90's come-back
 release.

 By this time, the group had just four members, Simon, Nick and John had
 stayed while Warren took Andy's old place as a guitarist. The new style of
 the group leaned more towards rock than pop or punk with electric guitars
 and drum machines taking over from real drums and synths.  Now their 1995
 audience was together again, some from the old era and some newcomers, it
 was time for another album.  This time entitled simply @{" THANK YOU " link "ThankYou" 0} and
 featuring a host of popular cover songs. To help enforce the No Drugs
 campaign they wanted to re-release @{" WHITE LINES " link "WHITE LINES" 0} (a #7 hit for Grandmaster
 Flash in 1985) so they teamed up with Melle Mel, Grandmaster Flash and the
 Furious Five to produce one of the most popular club anthems of their
 career. Other songs from the album included @{" TAKE ME HIGHER " link "HIGHER" 0} and
 @{" PERFECT DAY " link "PERFECT DAY" 0} (originally written by Lou Reed).  Roger Taylor also
 returned to play on both @{" PERFECT DAY " link "PERFECT DAY" 0} and @{" WATCHING THE DETECTIVES " link "WATCHING THE DETECTIVES" 0}.

 The @{" THANK YOU " link "ThankYou" 0} album sold well but not really enough to make it a
 success story and promotion wasn't used to its full potential.  Undetered,
 Duran took a break from music before comming back to produce yet another
 album in yeat another experimental style.  Entitled @{" MEDAZZALAND " link "Medazzaland.al" 0}, the new
 meterial leaned more towards brit-pop, rock and electronica rather than
 the more concervative approach of the @{" WEDDING ALBUM " link "Wedding" 0}. At this time, John
 made the decision to move onto a solo career and leave the rest of the
 album for Warren to work on.  Management problems also arrose and their
 frustration with EMI and CAPITOL records started to show.


 @{" MEDAZZALAND's " link "Medazzaland.al" 0} production was complete and ready to go by 1996 but
 technicalities help everything back for months while release dates were
 discussed.  The opportunity also arrose to include a song on Val Kilmers
 new film 'THE SAINT' and so @{" OUT OF ME MIND " link "OUT OF MY MIND" 0} became a number on the
 movie soundtrack.  Because of this, the band gained a little publicity
 off the film and prompted the release of @{" OUT OF MY MIND " link "OUT OF MY MIND" 0} as a single in
 the UK only.

 Late 1997 finally saw the release of @{" MEDAZZALAND " link "Medazzaland.al" 0} in Japan and the US but
 no offical European release could be finalised.  Promotion for the album
 had not gone completely in the right directions and to Duran finally
 decided to part company with EMI/CAPITOL for good and go their own way.
 And what's the story in 1998?  John has released a number of consistant
 titles as a solo artist and with a supergroup called Neurotic Outsiders
 with ex Guns-n-Roses members Matt Sorum and Duff McKagen, and ex Sex
 Pistol Steve Jones.  Nick is working on a rock opera with warren which
 has also been in production for quite a while called 'Bored with Prozac
 and the Internet'.  A B-sides collection has also been released by CAPITOL
 (their last record for them) entitled 'Essentials - Night Versions~ which
 includes most of their 12" extended mixes issued in the first five years
 of the 80's. Duran are currently in the process of producing a new album
 due sometime in 1999.

 
 Duran Duran have changed with the times, using various new styles and
 moving into the new era while most other bands of the 80's have dropped by
 the wayside.  Still big, still the best, still going strong.

 Complete Discography
 ====================

  Originally From:  Dr Duran Duran
  At:  http://blackcat.brynmawr.edu/~kimberly/Duran/discog/index.html

    It's quite amazing how much material Duran Duran has released
    over the years, from the smallest 3" CD to the largest double
    12" release, and in so many countries around the world, it
    becomes so hard to keep track of them all.  I hope this full
    discography goes some way to fixing that.

 All Along the Water
 ===================

   Guess you know, where I wanna go
   Got to see the water flow, try to understand
   Got me trapped, playing with me like a cat -
   Scrape your fingers down my back, pin me to the ground

       All along the water baby
       Take me to your water baby
       All along the water babe

(chorus)

 -

   I'll get by, can't you see I'm burning up
   When you come and turn it up, higher every time
   If I stay , Oh the end is near
   Come and get me out of here, come and get me now

(chorus) (chorus)

   (Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohhh!)

 -

   Tell me is there any left?
   I wanna drink it up -
   I'll drink it up.
   Baby, if there's any left
   I'll drink it up, drink it up, drink it up!

(chorus) (chorus)

  Thirsty for your water baby,
  Spanning from your torture babe,
  Take me to your water baby.

(chorus)

  (Got me trapped)
  Thirsty for your water baby,
  Sliding on your torso baby,
  Take me to your water baby.

  Thirsty for your water baby,
  Spanning from your torture babe,
  Take me to your water babe.

   You're going to be there.
   What do you care?
   What do you dare?
   What does your heart say now?

(chorus)


   Divine intervention, couldn't keep the word from leaking out,
   With your pleasure in suspension
   Not to mention what you're thinking about.
   If you need a lead to heaven,
   A place to share -

 A Matter Of Feeling
 ===================

   How does it feel, when everyone surrounds you?
   How do you deal, if crowds just make you feel lonely?
   What do you say?
   People going to try to pin you down.
   Waiting to smile, but there's no understanding.
   How after a while, you keep falling off the same mountain.
   Try to explain it, nothing really gets them that high.

       Steal away in the morning, love's already history to you
       It's a habit you're forming, this body's desperate for something new
       Just a matter of feeling.
       This moment's madness shot too fast
       And tears will dry as you're leaving
       Who knows you might find something to last..

   Emotions again, saved up for a rainy Monday
   But you laugh just the same, cuz it's been pouring on Sunday;
   Dial up your numbers and never let the zeros bring you down.
   How does it feel?
   Is time to heavy to hold, whatever you desire, but -
   The moment is holy, whenever you slow down to see life is passing by.

 A View to a Kill

   Meeting you, with a view to a kill
   Face to faces, secret places, feel the chill.
   Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making,
   Still overseas, could it be the whole lot opening wide
   A sacred why, A mystery gaping inside
   A week is why..


      Until we dance into the fire
      That fatal kiss is all we need
      Dance into the fire,
      To fatal sounds of broken dreams
      Dance into the fire,
      That fatal kiss is all we need
      Dance into the fire.....

 -

   The choice for you, is the view to a kill
   Between the shades, it's assassination standing still.
   First crystal tears, fall of snowflakes on your body
   First time in years, to drench you skin of lover's rosy stain
   A chance to find the phoenix for the flame,
   A chance to die..

      But can we dance into the fire
      That fatal kiss is all we need
      Dance into the fire
      To fatal sounds of broken dreams
      Dance into the fire
      That fatal kiss is all we need
      Dance into the fire
      When all we see.. is the view to a kill

   Ain't nobody's business
   But pain's a lonely mistress
   And you can't give up

   Flame burning
   Money that you're earning
   And you will be returning
   With a ball'n'chain

   Why do you love me
   When you don't need me
   Why do you want me all of the time ?
   In my whole life, didn't get no peacetime
   And I don't care if I live or die

       From where I stand, the truth isn't black and white,
       Alone we live and dir, we love and fight,
       Breath after breath, we carry this mortal coil,
       Safe for tomorrow.


   Do I dare, O do I dare,
   Follow through the message my whole body hears,
   Beating on my heart like a feather
   Beating of a moment til I disappear.


   Diga uma palavra alegre          (Say a happy word, something happy)

   Manda um recado que seja agora   (Send a message that is new)

   Faz o mundo ficar novo
   E dancar no colodo tal de amor   (Make a new world and dance in the arms

       Just as we slip on through to eternity
       Breath after breath we carry this mortal coil,
       Safe for tomorrow

   Teu amante                      (You drive me crazy! Make me diamonds
                                    of your love)

   Danca do somo do rento,
   Me ensina                       (Dance to the sound of the wind,
                                    teach me)

   Basta de sufoco, Nao faz jogo   (Stop the struggle, don't play games
                                     with me)

   The song is of the planets
   oh whoooooooo

   The dance is to the rhythm, of the rain
   Where everyone is coming from, is coming to
   And birth is just a breath after breath.

   But it always takes so damned long -
   Before I feel how much my eyes have darkened

       Fear hangs a plane of gunsmoke, drifting in our room.
       So easy to disturb with a thought with a whisper...
       With a careless memory
       With a careless memory


   On the table, signs of love lie scattered
   And the walls break, with a crashing within
   It's not as though - as though you really mattered
   But being close, how could I let you go, without some feeling
   Some precious sympathy following

   I think I'd laugh at you
   I know I'd cry

   As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
   You asked for the latest party
   With your silicone hump and your ten inchy stump
   Dressed like a priest you was,
   Todd Browning beast you was

   Crawling down the alley on your hands and knees,
   I'm sure you're not protected
   For its plain to see
   The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
   Hunt you to the ground they will
   Mannequins with kill-appeal

   Will they come?
   I keep a friend serene
   Will they come?
   Oh, baby, come unto me
   Will they come?
   Well, she's come, been, and gone

      Come out of the garden, baby
      You'll catch a death in the fog
      Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
      Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs

   Now halloween jack is a real cool cat,
   And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
   The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
   Onto the street below
   Oh tarzie go man, go

   Meets his little hussy with his ghost-town approach
   Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
   Sweetly reminiscent something mother used to bake
   Wrecked up and paralyzed
   Diamond Dogs are sable-ized

   Will they come?
   I keep a friend serene
   Will they come?
   Oh, baby, come unto me
   Will they come?
   Well, she's come, been, and gone

   In the year of the scavenger The season of the bitch
   Sashay on the board-walk scurry to the ditch
   Just another future song lonely little kitch
   There's gonna be sorrow try and wake up tomorrow

   I keep a friend serene
   Will they come?

 Do You Believe In Shame?

      Do you believe in love?
      Do you believe in shame?
      And if love can conquer all then why do we only feel the pain?


   I heard you speak my name, heard you singing The Stones,
   Maybe heard you laughing in a line of static on my telephone

   So why your eyelids are closed, inside a case of rust,
   And did you have to change all your poets fire into frozen dust?

   I've tried to justify it, to learn from your mistake,
   But where's the stupid lie that has to make it's point -
   With such a pointless waste.

   Come out...


      Do you believe in shame?
      Do you believe in love?
      And if they taste the same would you love again or abandon both?


   I don't think I ever can, belive my friend has gone,
   Keep saying it's alright,
   I'm going to bring you back but I know I'm wrong.

   There's nothing I can say, there's nothing left to do
   It's just that lately I feel so damn lonely when I think of you

   And it may seem selfish now, but I'll hold on to the memory
   Until all this fear is washed away

     Do you believe in love?
     Do you believe in life?
     'Cos I believe a little part of you inside of me will never die..

     'Cos I Believe a little part of you inside of me will never die..

   And all along Santa Monica Boulevard,
   The cars were stood still,
   In a gleaming metal tube,
   Which stretched all the way from highland,
   Back to La Brea.
   And shimmered under Los Angeles sunshine.

   A young man was sitting at the wheel
   On his way to make a pickup.
   Turned off the air-con
   Rolled down the window
   And began to sweat

   Out over the Hollywood hills
   He saw the clouds building 
   Like great, dark, towers of rain
   Ready to come tumbling down,
   Any day now..
   Not a day too soon.   (Any day now)

   And as the music drifted in from other cars,
   His eyes started to slip.
   This is the story of his dream

   She moon,  she turning away,
   The city's her slave, he's cheating his mistress
   She's moody and grey, she's mean and she's restless (so restless)

   All over you as they say rumours or rivals yell at the strike force
   Hi guys, by the way, are you aware you're being illegal
   It's making your savior behaviour look evil
   'scuse my timing but say,
   How d'you fit in with this flim, flam and judy

       Maximum big suprise your smile is something new
       I pull my shirt off and pray,
       We're sacred and bound to suffer the heatwave
       Pull my shirt off and pray,
       We're coming up on re-election day


   Don't even try to induce,
   In all my restrain there's no hesitation
   All the signs on the loose
   'cause sanity's rare this end of the hard day   (yeh)
   Shadows are crawling out of the subway
   Any way that you choose in every direction just to confuse me

       Maximum big suprise she knows something new
       I pull my shirt off and pray,
       I'm saving myself to suffer the heatwave
       Pull my shirt off and pray, we're coming up on re-election day


   By roads and backways a lover's chance down a wind
   Curtain murmurs and sounds be calm hands on skin
   Carry further ..entangled strands all sing
   Saving some time to slip away we could dance oh..

   Shouldn't be asking wild and scheming
   Could be my election day

   Stretching my back down the way
   To your invitation stretching my body
   Use your intuitive play cause maybe we have more play time than money

       Maximum big suprise you know something new
       I pull my shirt off and pray,
       We're sacred and bound to suffer this heatwave
       Pull my shirt off and pray we're coming up on re-election day

Re-election day

   I knew when I first saw you on the showroom floor,
   You were made for me.
   I took you home and dressed you up in polyester,
   Princess of my dreams,
   Emotionless and cold as ice,
   All of the things I like.
   The way you look - the way you move - the sounds you're makin'
   In ultra chrome latex and steel -

      I plug you in
      Dim the lights, Electric Barbarella.
      Your perfect skin
      Plastic kiss, Electric Barbarella.
      Try to resist
      Then we touch,
      Hallucinate and tranquilize


   (she's so fine)
   (she's all mine)

   My private life is subject to investigation,
   No time to waste.
   People say they heard about our deviation
   But you never looked so good,
   Wear the fake fur and fake pearls for me,
   And put on your mystery.
   The way I feel you know I'll never keep you waiting
   In ultra chrome latex and steel -

   Lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling,

 God

   God created the world,
   Then created the Devil to blame for his mistakes


   I closed the door of my hotel room behind me,
   It was like closing a chapter in the book of life.
   Outside thirty floors below I could hear the police
   Using their sirens like wolf whistles to pick up young girls.


   On TV Oliver North (his fifteen minutes of fame ticking steadily away)
   Was being fuzzy about crucial events which had happened a year earlier
   What a flake...but then who isn't?
   That was Regan's defence at least.


   The worst thing is how politics begin to lead into your life.
   Back in our innocence we used to simply stick two fingers up to
                                                               politics,
   Say "fuck the Queen", that was about all you had to say anyway,
   And go back to the more important business of making music.


   So why was I sitting there feeling angry about -
   Covert operations and illegal aid to the contras?
   I mean I'm not even American (may be we all are a little bit).
   Then I realised it was just the idea that in this particular democracy
   And probably every other one in the world, there is somebody in power
   Who thinks he is more right than all the people who put him there,
   All the people who for once in their lives took an interest.


   Outside the wind was howling the "Who Who's" from Sympathy for the Devil
   Round and round the concrete hotel walls and corners.
   That was then, this is...!

 Hungry Like the Wolf
 ====================

   (Ha ha!)

   Dark in the city, night is a wire
   Steam in the subway, earth is a fire
   Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do
   Woman you want me, give me a sign
   And catch my breathing even closer behind
   Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do

       In touch with the ground
       I'm on the hunt I'm after you
       Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
       And I'm hungry like the wolf
       Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme
       I'm on the hunt I'm after you
       Mouth is alive with juices like wine
       And I'm hungry like the wolf


   Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
   I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
   Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do
   High blood drumming ony our skin it's so tight
   You feel my heart, I'm just a moment behind
   Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do

       In touch with the ground
       I'm on the hunt I'm after you
       Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
       And I'm hungry like the wolf
       Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
       I howl and I whine I'm after you
       Mouth is alive all running inside
       And I'm hungry like the wolf

    I know you're watching me every minute of the day yeah
    I've seen the signs and the looks and the pictures -

    With broken glass for us to hold
    And I cut so far before I had to say...

         Please please tell me now, is there something should know?
         Is there something I should say,
         That would make you come my way?
         Do you feel the same 'cos you don't let it show.


    People stare and cross the road from me
    And jungle drums they all clear the way for me
    Can you read my mind, can you see in the snow
    And firey demons all dance when you walk through that door
    Don't say you're easy on me, you're about as easy as a nuclear war

    There's a dream that strings the road,
    With broken glass for us to hold
    And I'll cut so far before I had to say...

   Must be lucky weather when you find the kind of wind that you need
   C'mon show me all the light and shade that made your name

       And it's barren in your garden let me in...
       Because there's heat beneath your winter let me in..

   Lady Ice, slips into her soul
   Lady Ice, leaves a house so cold
   Lady Ice, did you know that the world was lonely too?

   Drifting snows searching flames and hide
   Burning stones, as she looks for the heart somebody stole.

       She knows the violation, lovers' arms, without occasion..
       Who knows where to find a true heart for Lady Ice?

 -

   Mezmerized in the candle flame
   Compromised by the cruel bands of steel around her breast

       She knows the desolation, of lovers' arms, their isolation..
       Who knows where to find the true heart for Lady Ice?

 -

   Lady's eyes, slip away from the part she plays in school..

       She knows of roles and hide-aways
       Suppose she knows the time's away?
       She knows where to find the true heart for Lady Ice..

   Lady Ice, step outside your soul
   Lady Ice, do you know that the world is frightened too?

   When I first met you on the roof,
   You cought me in your web of youth,
   But now I know the wicked truth,
   It's much to late so what's the use in fighting?

   You peel me like an onion skin,
   And wonder at the state I'm in,
   One day you'll turn up to begin,
   And find there's nothing left but innuendo.. (innuendo)

   Beside you others fade away,
   Like amateurs in love's charade,
   Much more than just a game you play,
   The secertain rules become a way of living.. (way of living)

       Night after night I try to prove
       That I can resist you
       Tied up inside your Love Voodoo
       Designed to Manipulate


   The Queen of sensuality,
   You shelter me from Liberty,
   It's nothing short of Piracy,
   That's not to say it doesn't please me sometimes.

   Now this may come as no surprise,
   But I'm content to compromise,
   Until the day you realize,
   That I have been manipulating you.. (no surprise, no surprise)

   Blue eyes, blue eyes, how come you tell so many lies?

       Come up and see me, make me smile
       Or do what you want, run on wild.


   There's nothing left, all gone and run away
   Maybe you'll tarry for a while
   It's just a test, a game for us to play
   Win or lose, it's hard to smile
   Resist, resist, it's from yourself you have to hide.

   There ain't no more, you've taken everthing
   From my belief in Mother Earth
   How can you ignore my faith in everything

   Away, away, and don't say maybe you'll try.

   Don't know you at all.

   But you pull the mountain from under me
   Look, I'm dangling up in the blue
   And it's a cartoon kind of eternity -
   Before I drop, down to you.
   What am I supposed to do now?

   There is something beautiful shining
   In the hollow knot of your head
   If only for a while it seemed to come from the sky -
   But it's in your head,
   Yes it fills your head.

   You and I don't always fly
   Let me go I wanna fall -
   Deep into the dark

 Of Crime And Passion
 ====================

   Why did you let me run,
   When you knew I'd fall for the gaping hole -
   Where your heart should be?
   Liar - couldn't cut me deeper with a knife if you tried -
   Just take a look, before you run off and hide, at your victim, arise...

      Clouds on you shoulder
      Aren't they grazed by the afterglow
      How quiet they gather -
      When the storm is about to blow -
      Oh, oh, now don't look away,
      Caught in the crossfire
      And it ain't no wind of change
      I'm talking of crime and passions rage.


   Summer of madness the undertow, dragged me up an alley -
   For the blossoming fire on a strangers smile.
   Bride of wires - how disguise so easily cracked -
   Saw your heart turn spade, this orchids turned to black..

      Graze on your shoulder
      Like the clouds in the afterglow
      How quiet they gather -
      When the storm is about to blow -
      Oh, oh, now don't look away
      Caught in the crossfire
      And it ain't no wind of change
      I'm talking of crime and passions rage

 -

      Way down by the shoulder
      In the haze of the afterglow
      Stranded together -
      And the storm's about to blow -
      Oh, oh, now don't look away
      Caught in the crossfire
      And it ain't no wind of change
      I'm talking of crime and passions..

      Oh, oh now don't look away
      Caught in the crossfire
      And it ain't no wind of change
      I'm talking of crime and passion..

      Don't look away
      Caught in the crossfire
      And if ain't no wind of change
      I'm talking of crime and passion...

 Ordinary World

   Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
   Thought I heard you talking softly.
   I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
   Still I can't escape the ghost of you
   What has happened to it all?
   Crazy, some'd say,
   Where is the life that I recognize?
   Gone away...


       But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
       Somehow I have to find.
       And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world...
       I will learn to survive.


   Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
   "Pride will tear us both apart"
   Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away,
   Left me in the vacuum of my heart.
   What is happening to me?
   Crazy, some'd say,
   Where is my friend when I need you most?
   Gone away...

   Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
   Here today, forgot tomorrow
   Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need

   The taste of you upon my lips, the fingers in my brain
   Ever gentle, as it kills me where I lay
   Who am I to resist, who are you to fail?

      But I can't escape from the feeling
      As I try to leave the memory behind
      Without you what's left to believe in?

   She's working all through the night.
   A jump into the deep end,
   Gave her the evidence she required.
   Take five, she's got pearls,
   Don't fake it when it comes to making money -
   So... she smiles, but that's cruel
   If you knew what she'd think, if you knew what she was after...

   Sometimes she wonders... and she laughs in her frustration


        Would someone please explain...
        The reason for this strange behaviour
        In exploitation's name...
        We must be working for the skin trade.


   Doctors of the revolution gave us, the medicine we desired.
   Besides being absolutely painless it's a question of compromise
   You've got steel, it's so cool,
   Get angry at the weekend then go back to school
   So big deal, it's what rules
   When it comes to making money, say yes, please, thank you...

   There's always time for pretty flowers growing in the dirt but -
   Time is your needle into my heart,
   And I must be hollow
   Cause I can't follow there

    But, as I waled on, I realized I was going up.

    Somebody whistled behind and turning round, they seemed far below.
    Then I came to where there had been a fire and was shaded
    From the sun by the trees.

      And the droning engine throbs in time
      With your beating heart

   The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
   Swim seagull in the sky towards that hollow western isle
   My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze

   Strange coincidence each time you look my way

   Know my weakness call it, dejavu

   Why should I be suprised by you

 Too Late Marlene
 ================

   Walking out of nowhere
   And I let you in
   Til my imagination, went for a spin
   I seen you every night
   Been making out since then
   And still I wonder why everybody's saying
   That ice is thin.

   And I think I know you
   Just a little bit by now
   And I think I can show you
   You see baby, I don't want to fight about it...


       Send down your rain,
       Then who's to blame?
       And you'll understand because its' much too late to change.


   Awaken to this hunger
   And then watch my heat
   Grow paler than the moonlight
   That you made me eat
   And if we run our lives
   Along a one way street
   We'll always wonder why everytime -
   It still tastes just as sweet

   And I think I know you
   Just a little bit by now
   And I think I can show you
   You see baby, I don't want to fight about it...

(chorus)


   I will explain, (too late)
   We're to much the same, (too late)
   No I won't leave
   Because it's just too late Marlene

-
   You see baby, I don't want to fight about it...

 Undergoing Treatment
 ====================

   We are.. undergoing treatment
   Watching others in the news
   Studying our worst reviews.
   They say.. we'll get over it
   Disappear like dinosaurs
   To the sound of small applause.

   Resigned to many cries section

       If you see me walking in the garden
       Don't ever ask me for an autograph
       If you ever catch me in the arcade
       Don't even stop me for a photograph


   We are.. undergoing treatment
   Till our record fits the scene,
   Layed out in Q Magazine.
   They crave.. our conformity
   Mediocre to the bone,
   Terrified testosterone.

   But why, do we still face the music?

       If you see me walking in the garden
       Don't ever ask me......


   Now and then, you-get-the strangest notion
   That there's something missing,
   But it keeps you guessing.
   Wild ambition, can you really blame us?
   Can you entertain us?
   Can you give a little more?

   In the purple evening silence, venice dreaming of a partner.
   Fill your arms with breasts of marble, from the cradle to the table
   Coax this naked treasure, from your saviour.

        Come swim into my love
        Come swim into my life


   Divine blasphemer tempting, holly beads of jism
   With a scarlet catechism, her lips will answer
   (ah, her lips will answer)

   How to be, the perfect stranger, the perfect lover - wanting
   And as you'll discover - giving, and as you'll discover  - being.

        Come swim into my life
        Enter this sublime corrosion
        Venice drowning in emotion

   But he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart.


   Long shot of that jumping sign
   Visible shivers running down my spine
   Cut the baby taking off her clothes,
   Close-up of the sign that says "we never close"
   You snatch a tune, you match a cigarrette,
   She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet,

   Now you think you're alone until you realize you're in it
   Now fear is here to stay love is here for a visit.
   They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit.
   Someone's scratching at the window. I wonder who is it?
   The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
   Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance.
   Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
   It only took my little fingers to blow you away

   And lovers war with arrows over secrets they could tell

   They tried to tame you, looks like they'll try again

 Winter Marches On
 =================

   (Oooh, ohhh, Mmmm)

   The trade's on.
   She drains emotion -
   To drink from,
   The breast of fortune
   Dreams have frozen, 
   Crystal in the morning
   Birthtime rose,
   A thorn for coronation.

 -

   All arise from your rest
   We'll find enough there to feed you.
   Soon you'll belong to the blessed
   Spare us your lives while we need you.

      Loud, is the music, the crowd is ringing
      Out, of my head as the winter marches on...

      Loud is the music the sky is bringing
      Out of my head as the winter marches on...

 -

      Loud, is the music, the crowd is bringing
      Out, of my head as the winter marches on...

      Loud is the music the sky is ringing

   And on...

 FREQUENTLY ASK QUESTIONS 1
 ==========================

    FROM: Duran FAQ      AT: http://www2.hawaii.edu/~bueno/DDFAQ/



 <Q> Is there any meaning behind the title Seven and the Ragged Tiger.
 
 <A> According to Seemant Kulleen, "The title is an interesting one...The
 seven' refers to the five band members (as they were then: Roger, Andy,
 John, Nick, and Simon), and their two managers (long since having parted
 ways unamicably), and the 'Ragged Tiger' is success, which they had
 apparently caught and chained down by the time they released that album,
 only their third."  




 <Q> What's the special code behind the numbers on the Arcadia album
  cover?

 <A> The numbers on the cover art of "So Red the Rose" (cover art
  referring to the entire package) spells out various names and words. 

 The code is as follows:  

   00= blank space  16 = A           30 = H          44 = O
   06 = V           18 = B           32 = I          46 = P
   08 = W           20 = C           34 = J          48 = Q
   10 = X           22 = D           36 = K          50 = R
   12 = Y           24 = E           38 = L          52 = S
   14 = Z           26 = F           40 = M          02 = T
                    28 = G           42 = N          04 = U




 <Q> What does "Nocymb" mean on "Big Thing?" 
 
 <A> "Nocymb" simply means "no cymbals," as in no cymbal crashes at the
 drum fills.




 <Q> What's being said at the end of "The Chauffeur?" 

 <A> The consensus among the Tiger List is "There's more to this kind of
 camoflauge, more than just color and shape." This was taken from a BBC
 educational program about butterfiles. Malinda McCall explains: 

 The line would probably be about protective coloration and the
 salt-and-pepper moth. In the south of England, it is black and white
 speckled and blends in with black-and-white speckled tree bark. In the
 north of England (may have locations wrong) there is more industry, like
 in Birmingham. More industry = more pollution. More pollution = black tree
 trunks. The salt-and=pepper colored moth has genetically adapted to become
 an all-black moth so (s)he can hide on a black, sooty tree trunk.




 <Q> Is Simon quoting "Is There Something I Should Know?" on "Yo Bad
 Azizi?"

 <A> Yes he is. According to one story, a fan wrote to the band asking what
 they meant by "Yo bad azizi as a nuclear war." During the recording of
 "Liberty", the band recorded the song using that line. "Yo Bad Azizi"
 appears as a b-side to various "Liberty"-era  singles. 




 <Q> What was Duran Duran's original name? And how did they get its name?

 <A> Duran Duran's original name is Duran Duran. John and Nick allegedly
 performed under the moniker RAF (which means Royal Air Force), but this
 "band" did not include any of Duran Duran's first-album line-up. The name
 Duran Duran is taken from the film "Barbarella" starring Jane Fonda.

    FROM: Duran FAQ      AT: http://www2.hawaii.edu/~bueno/DDFAQ/



 <Q> How do I get stuff from the Internet Tiger archives? 

 <A> The Tiger List has moved to a new location. For now, old issues of
 the digest and the FAQ are available. Other items, such as article
 transcripts, will be available later. Tiger-List administrator Rob Novak
 expounds... 

 To use the list archives, email-

         "tiger-list-requestindyrampcom"

 With a subject of "archive dir" (to get a directory) or "archive get " to
 get in the tiger-list directory. You can put more than one command in the
 message by  putting these commands in the body of the message too...

 EXAMPLE: To get the discography (I think) this should work:

 To: tiger-list-requestindyramp.com 
 Subject: archive get DISCOGRAPHY (body is not important)


 The archives are also accessible via FTP. To contribute an item, upload it
 into the pub/incoming dir with a README file detailing the files contents.
 For example, a file called FAQ.txt would need another file, FAQ.README,
 to explain it. Or you can e-mail Rob with an explanation




 <Q> Does anybody have a list of Duran Duran fan clubs? 

 <A> A list of fan clubs, formerly maintained by the FAQ, is now under the
 jurisdiction of Kapil Mathur. For a copy of this document, e-mail :-

   mailto:mathurnexus.chapman.edu

 or visit his "http://www.chapman.edu/students/mathur/duran.html" web site.
 The easiest way though is to access the Fanzine area on this guide.



 <Q> Do you think Andy will re-join the band now that Roger played on
 "Thank You"? 

 <A> Although Andy and John are currently working on the Power Station
 sequel,there is no "OFFICIAL" word about Andy rejoining Duran Duran. (See
 the private lives FAQ to see Roger's stance on re-joining the band.)




 <Q> Can somebody list all the WWW pages and Internet sources related to
 Duran Duran? 

 <A> A list of Duran Duran-Friendly Internet resources, has changed into
 the full WWW page at :- 

  "http://www.chapman.edu/students/mathur/duran.html" 

 The Duranie Connection, a WWW site maintained by Kapil Mathur. Check this
 site out for links to other Duran Duran home pages. Also check out the
 WWW sites in this guide.




 <Q> Who is Allison Anders and what's her relation to the band?
 
 <A> Allison Anders is the director of the films "Gas Food Lodging" and
 "Mi Vida Loca" (My Crazy Life). She is a friend of John, and wrote "Mi
 Vida Loca" for him to direct. John turned the project down, instead
 opting to write the score for the film. 




 <Q> Why doesn't the band perform "New Moon on Monday" anymore? 

 <A> The band has gone on record saying that they no longer like the song.
 The sheet music for the album "Seven and the Ragged Tiger" includes short
 explanations by Simon about the song lyrics. Back then, Simon said,
 "Jesus, I love this song." Now, Duran Duran has had a change of heart.

 ==========================

    FROM: Duran FAQ      AT: http://www2.hawaii.edu/~bueno/DDFAQ/




 <Q> What's up with Andy and Roger? 

 <A> In 1990, Andy released a covers album titled, "Dangerous," but the
 album never reached the US. In 1993, news reached Tiger that he is now a
 member of former MCA-labelmates, Then Jerico. 

 Roger sold his farm in Glouchestershire to return to drumming. He stated
 in an article in the New Music Express (related by fanzine Cherry
 Lipstick which was then related to Tiger by Rhonda Corcoran) that he has
 no intention of re-joining Duran Duran, but he said he would do some
 session work with them. He played on two tracks on "Thank You"- "Perfect
 Day" and "Watching the Detectives." 




 <Q> What are the names and ages of the Duran offspring? What are the
 birth dates of each DD member? 

 <A> 
     The Band....

     Simon John Charles LeBon       Oct. 27, 1958 (Scorpio)
     Nigel John Taylor              June 20, 1960 (Gemini)
     Nicholas James (Bates) Rhodes  June 8, 1962 (Gemini)
     Warren Bruce Cuccurullo        Dec. 8, 1956 (Sagittarius)
     Andrew Taylor                  Feb. 16, 1961 (Aquarius)
     Roger Andrew Taylor            Apr. 26, 1960 (Taurus)

 The debate about Andy Taylor's middle name has drawn three conclusions.
 His birth certificate, first of all, lists no middle name. Another
 argument  states that "Arthur" is his middle name. Other sources state
 that Andy took his wife's name as well, turning it into "Wilson-Taylor."

     The offspring.... (with names of respective mothers)

   SIMON and Yasmin Parevnah Le Bon:
     Amber Rose Tamara LeBon        August 25, 1989
     Saffron Sahara LeBon           September 25, 1991
     Tallulah Pine LeBon            September,10 1994

   NICK and Julie-Anne Friedman (divorced):
     Tatjana Lee Orchid Rhodes      August 23, 1986

   JOHN and Amanda DeCadenet:
     Atlanta Noo DeCadenet Taylor   March 31, 1992

   WARREN and Claudia Bueno (unmarried):
     Mayko Bueno                    July, 1983

   ANDY and Tracy Wilson Taylor:
     Andrew James Taylor            August 20, 1984
     Georgina Taylor                August 1987/1988
     Bethany Taylor                 September 1991

   ROGER and Giovanna Cantone (divorced):
     James Taylor                   August 1987/1988

 Amanda referred to Atlanta as "Noo" in a 1992 radio show. "Noo" is an
 abbreviation of "Noodlehead." In recent articles, Amanda and John have
 nicknamed Atlanta "Bean." Though Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain's daughter
 is also nicknamed "Bean," John and Amanda reportedly used the name after
 seeing Atlanta in an ultrasound. 

 Warren is NOT Mayko's biological father, but he does consider Mayko his
 "son." 

 All information on Roger Taylor is unconfirmed. Latest news indicates
 that Roger and Giovanna are still together and recently had another boy,
 named Elliott. 




 <Q> Is it true that John had a drug problem? What's the group's history
 with drugs?

 <A>The members of Duran Duran have, at one time or another, experimented
 with drugs. Andy Taylor, in fact, acquired the nickname "The Sniffer."
 John Taylor was addicted to cocaine circa Big Thing Tour but has since
 kicked the habit.  It is also known that Nick kicked the cock habbit not
 so long ago and must surely be one of the causes of the divorce.

 Tina Lawson cites an aritcle from Q, spring of 1993 on the subject of
 John Taylor: 

 "John bubbles with enthusiasm.  He seems the most obviously music driven
 and keen to talk about it.  He is also the one who went just a little bit
 bonkers in the 80's and hurled himself into the rock'n'roll lifestyle
 with a king-sized coke habit which was followed by a health kick so
 extreme  that no morsel would pass his lips if it hadn't been organically
 grown and plucked that day within a five-mile radious of his fork. 'Well,
 not exactly,' he avers, 'but it was pretty wild for a time. You've just
 got to, er, try these things once.  I suppose.  A coke problem is almost
 part of the package for stardom, you know.  Lennon had it.  Keith had it.
 In a way you got lulled into it.  I'm glad I'm the way I am now, came out
 of it with most of my mind intact.'" 




 <Q> When did Nick get his divorce? Who is he dating now?

 <A> Nick's divorce was finalized in mid-December, 1994. He is currently
 dating a cartoonist named Madeliene Farley.




 <Q> Why did Sterling Campbell leave the band?

 <A> The following is excerpted from an interview with Warren by Mandy
 Jones for Cyndi Glass' fanzine, Privacy, March/April 1995 issue: 

 M: "What happened with Sterling?"

 W: "It just didn't work out...He did write some stuff with us, but it
 wasn't really his forte. He wasn't around at the beginning of the last
 album and we were working so fast. It was nice to work without drums, as
 writers it was a lot easier to write without a drummer. Nothing personal
 to him. And also I think it was a bit of too many cooks, that stuff comes
 into it. It's very easy to work the way we work now."

 M: "Whose idea was it for him to leave?"

 W: "I think the four of us decided, I really don't remember the exact
 situation. I remember he just wasn't here, he was hanging out in Spain a
 lot. He was contacted a few times, and I think he was...a bit taken that
 the album didn't do well. Maybe he thought he could get something better
 somewhere else. I don't know, I really don't know what was going through
 his head. It wasn't an easy decision for us to make, from what I remember
 we were working here every day, and he wasn't around. We don't really
 need a drummer in the band."




 <Q> What's happening with John and his marriage?

 <A> John and Amanda are currently separated. Tabloids report that Amanda
 is shacking up with Ashley Hamilton. Some also say she's seeing Keanau
 Reeves.  Amanda stated in a posting on AOL that she and John are taking a
 breather from each other. Atlanta is with John. 




 <Q> What's the story behind Andy Taylor's departure?

 <A> Andy, a hard rocker before joining Duran Duran, was dismayed at the
 direction the band was heading, especially during the "Seven and the
 Ragged Tiger" era. Hence, he formed Power Station with John and
 contributed to soundtracks for the movie "American Anthem" and "Miami
 Vice"

 Andy and Missing Persons shared management. He hired drummer Terry Bozzio
 and bassist Patrick O'Hearn for his solo album when singer Dale Bozzio
 quit Missing Persons. Warren, at the time Missing Persons' guitarist,
 auditioned with Duran Duran, knowing Andy was going to quit before Nick,
 Simon and John did. When Andy did leave, Warren became a salaried
 guitarist for Duran until 1989 when he became a full member. 

 Both Andy and Duran Duran threw mud at each other in the press for a
 while. Andy sued the band for back royalties later, alleging that he
 received no money for his appearance on the "Notorious" album. As a
 result, Andy gets no writing credit on the album but retains his guitar
 credit though most of the work was done by Warren and/or Nile Rodgers. 

 Recently, John re-formed Power Station with all the original members, but
 the project was eventually scrapped. Simon and Nick, however, refer to
 Andy (and Roger) cautiously in the press. Andy now lives in Los Angeles.

 ==========================

    FROM: Duran FAQ      AT: http://www2.hawaii.edu/~bueno/DDFAQ/



 <Q> When is "Thank You" going to be released? What about Power Station II?

 <A> "Thank You" is out NOW. The album was released on Tues, April 04,
 1995. "Diamond Dogs" does not appear on the album. Power Station II has
 yet to be released, but sources indicate that the album may be released
 soon.

 On a related note, the credits on "Thank You" are not accurate. Terry
 Bozzio plays on "Success" and Steve Ferrone plays on "Crystal Ship." The
 credits list the opposite.




 <Q> Why is my CD version of "Rio" different from my US album/cassette
 version?

 <A> The CD pressing of "Rio" contains the mixes initially released in the
 UK. According to legend, Nick was unhappy with the results and wanted to
 remix it. He was working on the remixes up until the band shot the video
 for "Hungry Like the Wolf." David Kershenbaum got final credit. The album
 released in the US in 1982 contains these extended mixes ("My Own Way,"
 "Hold Back the Rain" among them.)

 When "Rio" was re-issued on CD in the late-80's, the band opted to use
 the original UK pressing. That is the album in your possession now.




 <Q> I can't find the early Duran videos. Anybody know where I can get
 them?

 <A> The early Duran videos -- "Duran 45" (includes "Girls on Film," and
 "Hungry Like the Wolf"), "Duran Duran" (first 11 videos), "Sing Blue
 Silver", and the more recent "Three to Get Ready" are out-of-print on VHS.
 
 "Dancing on the Valentine", "Arena" and "Decade" should still be available
 on laserdisc, the latter on VHS. The new video, "Extraordinary World"
 is available in the US on laserdisc.




 <Q> Does anybody have any info on [fill in the blank] release? Where can I
 get a discography?

 <A> A published discography is available from Kimberly Blessing's fanzine,
 carnival at:-

    http://blackcat.brynmawr.edu/~kimberly/Duran/carnival.html 

 You can also get a book containing the complete discography as compiled by
 Carnival magazine, with help from Richard John, Dan Ayres, and others.
 Includes photos and pricing guide. Cost is $20 in US, $25 elsewhere.

 Send check or money order, made payable to Kimberly Blessing, to:

         CARNIVAL, 930 Sassafras Cir,West  Chester PA 19382 




 <Q> Do you know where I can find [blank] release?

 <A> Collectors often scan publications such as Goldmine, Record Collector
 and ICE CD Newsletter for rarities. 

 Record Runner in New York City is often considered to be a Duran-friendly
 collector store, and it is, by all means, not the only one. Ask around for
 suggestions. 

 In terms of the Net, the World Wide Web has a few vendors dealing with
 collectibles, such as :

        http://gemm.com/           The Global Music Marketplace

 A good starting point for browsing is :

        http://www.yahoo.com/     Yahoo, a somewhat official yellow pages
                                  for the WWW. 


 You can also lurk on Usenet groups for potential offers :

       news:rec.music.marketplace  
       news:rec.music.cd
       news:rec.music.misc

 These are just three sources of collector information. 




 <Q> Is it safe to discuss bootlegs?

 <A> Though no one can be totally sure about who is lurking on any Internet
 forum, no legal action has been taken against any member of the Tiger
 List. Also, trades continue unabated on the list. The suggested course in
 seeking or offering a trade is to make a post or two about the item you
 wish to seek/ offer. Then transact any additional dealing through personal
 mail.

 If the legal, ethical or moral issue of bootlegs confuses you, an article
 in the November 1994 issue of Musician magazine thoroughly covers the
 subject. In general, the people profitting from bootlegs are the
 individuals that artists and labels seek. Fans trading boots are not the
 targets. 




 <Q> Is there a collection of b-sides on CD?

 <A> Desert DJ Services, a Las Vegas company, has compiled an unofficial
 collection of Duran Duran b-sides and rarities. Use your discretion in
 acquiring this release. 

 Duran Duran were also compiling such a compilation but paued the project
 after seeing what was already available, this is how piracy can actively
 damage the system. DD also wish to concentrate on new material before
 farming the old stuff. In all truth though, the B-sides album has been
 completed and has been mastered ready for release, probably after the
 release of Medazzaland.




 <Q> Any news on what their next album will be like?

 <A> Duran Duran's next album, tentatively titled "Medazzaland", and has
 described by the band in various articles, is "techno punk" or "trance
 punk." For a  time, the latter description was construed as a second
 tentative title.

 "Medazzaland" is a mispronounciation of an anesthetic used in surgery
 called "Midazolam." Simon, after a trip to the dentist, was doped out and
 Warren asked him what he was on. Warren thought Simon said "Medazzaland"
 and concluded that it was a designer drug. 

 According to recent reports on Tiger, the band has finished recording 16
 tracks, and Simon has written tentative lyrics. A single is expected to be
 released in November or December 1996, with the album following in
 February 1997.




 <Q> When is John's solo album going to be released? 

 <A> John's solo album was released in March. The general release includes
 11 tracks, but a  special edition for fans will have 12. The album is
 titled "Feelings Are Good and Other Lies". To receive more information on
 John's solo project, e-mail

   Career: Duran Duran
           Powerstation
           Neurotic (Boy) Outsiders

 Projects: Medazzaland,  I Do What I do,  Powerstation
           Feelings are Good and Other Lies, Powerstation II



 <Q> Why did you name your solo album "Feelings are Good and Other Lies"

 <A> I was thinking about "Feelings are Good and Other Lies", because
 there seems to be a lot of outpourings about crises that I was going
 through, that I've been going through, and it just struck me as though on
 the one hand, when you sing a song and you say "I love you. I can't live
 without you. How am I going to get by without you?", it's also a lie.
 Because there's a part of you that's saying that. But there's also a part
 ,at least a part of me, that is saying, "I'm so glad to get rid of you.
 I'm so glad to see the back of you. I'm so glad to be living on my own
 again. And life strikes me like that a lot. I feel ambivalence about
 pretty much everything. So, in a way, songs, at least the way I wri te
 them, turn out to be like little white lies.  I could look at any song,
 say "Ordinary World", and I remember when we were talking about "Ordinary
 World" in interviews, and Simon and I had never really discussed the
 song, but what it meant to me was that we were suddenly looking at our
 lives and how complex they'd become, and really wondering where that
 simplicity had gone, and really kind of mourning it, grieving it that it
 wasn't around anymore. Yet, applying my lie theory, you really wouldn't
 want life any other way. So, we put on a lot of stuff for effect when we
 write.  I thought I got an album title, looking at the album picture,
 but I'm thinking, its still an open book.




 <Q> When you were growing up, did you ever think that your life was
     going to be one of a world-famous musician?

 <A> It just happened. I think the stimuluses for me were primarily music,
 and music came into my house through radio. The appeal of traveling and
 probably subconsciously getting as far away from my family - you know,
 this is another ambivalence, it's like I love my family but I want to get
 away from them. I was looking for a means to do that. I think also,
 being an only child, I wanted brothers, so the idea of forming a band
 again made unconscious sense.

 Role models for me were The Beatles, and the England World Cup Soccer
 Team. So it was a band of boys that got to travel the world. As I started
 growing up and becoming a teenager, I just found that I was spending more
 and more of my time in music - not s o much playing music, I was not yet
 a musician - but just being a fan, and getting turned on by records and
 going to see bands, and getting thrilled by the whole aura, the whole
 world of popular music.



 <Q> What bands inspired you?

 <A> Roxy Music were very inspiring to me. When I was growing up. I liked
 Bryan Ferry's songwriting a lot. David Bowie and the Spiders from Mars,
 The Mick Ronson Band. Queen I liked a lot. And the Faces. Today, The
 Beatles are still the most influential band to me, I think.




 <Q> Are there any bands currently on the scene today that you like?

 <A> I like Hole. I like the Foofighters album. I like The Weezer album.
 I like Oasis a lot. I think they're a great band.




 <Q> Why did you choose a minor record label for your solo project?

 <A> I don't really need what a major label can give me. I'm not doing
 this for t he money. I'm not doing this for commercial gain. I want to
 maintain a level of purity in it. I don't need somebody saying, "Well
 John, we like that song, but we don't really like that one. Is there any
 chance you've got anything more like that?" All the kind of bullshit
 games that I've really, really been playing in Duran for so many years.



 <Q> When was most of this material written?

 <A> February, March. [1995]  I got the opportunity to use a studio. I
 met Hein Hoven, the producer, and he said, "Why don't you come up to my
 studio, and maybe we could make some music together. And, I thought,
 "That's not a bad idea. I said, "Well, actually I have got a couple of
 things knocking around, that really, they'd been knocking around since
 the morning. I mean, I always got stuff on... There always stuff cooking
 in the kitchen. It's just I never really serve any of it up because one
 thing about being in a band like Duran is that there's a limit put on
 your output.

 The industry only really wants to put an album out every two years. We
 see what happens when somebody like Prince tries to push the envelope and
 release a lot of music and the market gets saturated. MTV. Radio.
 Everybody. They don't want to deal with that much product. It's not
 healthy for Duran Duran to have records out every month of every year. I
 mean, it kind of would be healthy in one way, but people would tire of it
 very quickly. So, it was really just a case of writing. We were going to
 do an EP, so, here's four songs - well, why don't we make it a six song
 EP? And Steve Jones came and played on some of the songs. And he really
 did knock me out. And I started to take the work mo re seriously. I
 started thinking, "Wow, Maybe it's an album."

 I'd gotten quite bruised by the Powerstation project. I'd gotten back
 together with Powerstation and we'd written an album's worth of songs
 together, and I just came out of it thinking "Wow. Wow, I don't like
 this. I don't want to do this." But I had to do something, and the idea
 of solo album was banging on my head. It seemed such a cliche that I was
 resisting it. And I thought, No, No, I don't want to do that. It's so
 obvious." But then it became so obvious that it was obvious that I had to
 do it. And there was so much shit going on in my life that I had to
 express it in some way. It was a very interesting - and still is -
 process. I'd never sung a song before. I've been making records for 15
 years and I'd never sung a song from the heart that I'd written and then
 listen to myself singing it back. And it was really trippy. And it was
 scary, really fucking scary.



 <Q> How would you compare that to "I Do What I Do?"

 <A> Well, I'm much more exposed than "I Do What I Do." With that, for a
 start, I was never going to sing that song. All the music was written
 around Lisa Delbello singing it. And I didn't write a lot of the words -
 Michael De Barre did. So they weren't my feelings. And then it was the
 11th hour. She pulled out, and Jonathon, the producer of that song, said,
 "Well why don't you do that Johnny." And I'm like "What?" I mean, it was
 something I really didn't want to do. But I did it, and it was done. And
 there it was a nd the next thing I was doing a video for it and I guess I
 could have gotten very comfortable with the idea actually. I could have
 taken off at that point really and done a whole album's worth of songs.



 <Q> Will you tour with the "Feelings" album?

 <A> Well, I've got this really interesting band (Neurotic Boy Outsiders)
 at the moment. Myself, and Steve Jones and Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum
 from Guns N Roses. It came together totally synchronously. We appeared at
 a charity show together. We did a couple of Sex Pistols songs, and Steve
 sang a song of his. We had a good time, then the club owner said, "You
 guys should come back and play Monday nights." And we laughed about it,
 but it set a seed in my head and I thought "Wow,that would be really neat
 just to do a regular residency kind of situation because I just want the
 chance to sing live." It' s something I've not had much of an opportunity
 to do and I didn't want to have to go on tour particularly.  So that
 opportunity opened up and we took it. We put a set together. We've got
 three songs from my album and we just pick and choose. We play Sex Pistol
 songs. Some other songs. We play Beatle songs. We play Clash songs. We're
 doing that every Monday night in LA. We did New York, Philadelphia and
 Boston and now I'm going back to London to do some more work with Duran.
 I'd like to do more shows with them, maybe around Christmas. It's just
 taking it one step at a time. The key is to keep it spontaneous.



 <Q> How's the tour going so far?

 <A> New York was OK.  I'd have to say that it wasn ot the most fun you
 can have with your clothes on.  Toronto I enjoyed a lot more.  Also,
 we'd not been to Toronto.  We've been to New York.  We went to New York
 last November and it was a killer show.  So we had something to live up
 to there, but Toronto we still had the element of surprise working for
 us.



 <Q> How do you anticipate the rest of it?

 <A> I'm looking forward to it.  I look forward to cities we've not been
 to.  Just because it's like showing off a new car.  It's like  "Wow!
 Look at me! Look at my new band."  You know, "what do you think of
 THIS?"  Little nervous about LA at the end of it because of friends and
 relatives and I guess one cares more about them than anybody.  Even
 though they love you unconditionally.  And then we go to Europe and
 we're not doing a lot of shows the but I'm really looking forward to doing
 the shows that we are doing.


 <Q>Do you prefer large or small venues?

 <A>It doesn't matter to me. What I'm doing? I'm singing! It's completely
 different. It's so fresh to do that. It doesn't really matter whether I'm
 playing to fifty people or 5,000, it's all about me, and that's what it
 should be about. It shouldn't be like, "Is the place full tonight?  I'm
 fortunate that I can do this, that it's not paying the bills. And that
 affords me a certain freedom.



 <Q> Whats the inspiration behind Girl Raw

 <A> Its a song about a girl that I... Well, I couldn't believe it when I
 met her; I couldn't believe it when I started dating her; I couldn't
 believe it when I fell in love with her; I couldn't believe I started to
 resent her;  I couldn't believe it when I started to hate her; and I
 rubbed her raw, I drove her away.



 <Q> How do you like being a father? And has being a dad changed your
  musical direction?

 <A> What it made me realize is that a lot of the time now when I hear
 love songs, if I'm hearing a guy or a woman sing a beautiful love song,
 quite often now I'm thinking, "Hmm, I bet that's for their child." It
 opens up the vistas of love. Love was somethin g that I thought I could
 only feel for a woman, but it's become a much broader sense. She's an
 inspiration every moment. Everything I do is for her, in a sense now.



 <Q> How does Atlanta like Dad's music?

 <A> She loves it.  She's very proud of her dad. She's made me realize
 that it's important that I stay alive as long as I possibly can.



 <Q> What do you appreciate most about your fans?

 <A> Their tenacity, for one thing. The fact that they're so curious.
 I remember when we first did the Powerstation/Arcadia stuff, and a lot of
 the kids got very confused and for awhile there they were like, "We're
 really glad you guys are back together." There was a lot of
 narrowmindedness going on and it seemed to get ve ry constricting for
 awhile. I find some of the fans in Europe, especially the Italian fans,
 much more constrictive than over here. I find they still say, "Is Roger
 going to rejoin the band?" But now, I think that the broadness of what we
 do now - I'm doing music of my own, Warren is, etc., is what has kept
 people interested. I think that for people in their late 20s and 30s to
 stay interested in a musical entity, there's got to be a lot going on.
 There's got to be a fuckin soap opera, because an album of music every
 two years wouldn't be enough to keep people glued to the channel. There
 has to be a lot of stuff going on and I feel really encouraged by the
 fans I'm coming into contact with n ow. They really seem to understand
 why I'm doing what I'm doing. I find it astonishing that we're still all
 growing together, and we're all getting into relationships, we're all
 having problems, we're all having work trouble, we're all having kids.
 And we're still all growing together and that's amazing to me.



 <Q> Is it true you studied art at school?

 <A> Yes.




 <Q> Sculpture? Painting?  What aspects interest you the most?

 <A> Well, I never really know enough. When I was a student, I liked
 surrealism and pop art. Its something like if I have the time to visit
 the Louvre or the National Gallery, and I do it in the right state of
 mind, it will be a spiritual experience. I can see a painting by Picasso
 or Gauguin and it really throws everything up in the air.  But you know,
 I can see a movie also, and it can have that effect on me. I admire
 artists, painters and stand-up comics the most because they really have
 themselves. In a sense, what is driving me as an artist now, is that I
 feel that I need to be able to exist as an artist as independently as
 possible without a PA system, wi thout electricity. That's where I'm
 going. I found myself in a position where I would be playing to vast
 audiences with an extremely high tech light and sound system and I'd
 really be envying the guy playing on the street or the subway station. I
 was envying that purity and I've always liked that in painters.



 <Q> Looking back over your career, what song or songs stand out that you
 are most proud of?

 <A> "A View To A Kill" stands out. In my bathroom I've got the cover art,
 so it's quite high in my consciousness. I like "Wild Boys" also. They're
 both really good sounding records. But "Rio",and the first album, and
 well, I'm quite proud of all of them really. With the less commercially
 successful albums like "Notorious" and "Big Thing", we were pushing
 against a current and the fact is we were still trying to rediscover
 ourselves, reinvent ourselves, stay afloat when we were two men down. I
 went through a stage of being very, very critical, and I know we all can
 be a bit like that. It's like I said to Simon - it was quite along time
 ago actually - I said, "I was listening to "Liberty" and its really good.
 There are some really cool songs on it." And he said, "Wow. I can't
 listen to it. I'm so pleased you said that." When we finished that
 album, I don't think I listened to it for two years, because it takes
 over your life and the fun disappears. Again a lot of what my own music
 is about is putting the fun back into it. You know, just being
 spontaneous and not double, triple, quadruple thinking everything. I love
 Simon and I love songwriting and Iove his lyric writing, but sometimes he
 writes crap, but that's okay. I'm not into policing his thoughts. Its a
 very paranoid business, you know. I actually had a meeting with a guy
 from Capitol a couple of weeks ago, and I'd taken him some songs of
 Steve's actually, because I thought it would be a nice idea for him to
 sign Steve's album. And I didn't really want him to release my album, but
 then again, I kind of do. You know, there's a part of me that would like
 him to say, "Oh John, this is great. Let's put it out." I'm not that
 hungry about it, but I took him some of my songs. And we're talking and
 he's talking about Duran and he's saying, "We've really gotta be so
 careful. We've got to make sure everything we do is the right thing to
 do. With hindsight, maybe the covers album was the wrong thing to do.
 We've slipped back a bit..." And I'm thinking, [snoring sound from John].
 I don't care about that. I don't want to analyze it and I don't want to
 be working out of fear. It's like, how does the media keep us hooked on
 the media? They keep us scared. The only way to keep us buying newspapers
 or turning on the TV is if we're thinking maybe there's going to be an
 earthquake, or there's a mass murderer on the loose in the ne ighborhood.
 I want to find out if he's been caught yet. Now I live in L.A., and
 there's a lot more paranoia in this city. But L.A. sets the tone for a
 lot of Western Civilization.

 And so, this guy, he's trying to get me scared. He wants me to be scared
 because that way I'm going to be saying to him, "Well, what do you
 think? What do you think?" And I can't be bothered with that anymore. I
 just want to be.



 <Q> How is Medazzaland coming along?

 <A> It's slow, but beautiful. Duran albums are like trees, you know.
 They take such a long time. Simon, Warren, Nick and I, we're all very
 caring and quite anal. It takes a long time, but we're building trees.
 It's going to be a great album. Yeah. I don't ever see us making an album
 of all ballads, or.. um, well actually, you know what? Maybe that's not
 such a bad idea.

 We're always pushing and pulling in different directions. There's a song
 on the album called Tabular Ratha, it's under three minutes long, and it
 started out being very new wavy. It's fast, and short and it was
 guitar-based and drums-driven, but now we'v e put a load of keyboards on
 it and its got kind of a Devo feel to it.

 You know, the songs metamorphosize all the time. Something that could be
 sounding one way, Warren then plays his part, and it completely
 transforms the sound of the song. We recorded guitars, drums and bass
 live. We put down 14 songs in an eight day period. So that was something
 that we've been working to try to achieve for years, and just had to have
 the discipline to do it.  But Steve Alexander, who drummed on the last
 tour, is a great drummer and we feel very comfortable with him in the
 band. And it was easy to do. So I know there's a spontenaity and a drive
 to the tracks that perhaps hasn't been on other albums.



 <Q> Medazzaland's musical style has been described as Trance Punk. Can
 you tell us a little more about Trance Punk?

 <A> Warren said it, and I picked it up and ran with it, and used it as
 a catch-all phrase. Now, I'm beginning to regret it already. 



 <Q> Will we ever see a Duran B-sides album?

 <A> Definitely! I'd be interested in hearing, maybe a poll or something,
 of what the fans would like to hear on it. I worked to make [it] happen
 this year.  I really wanted it to come out this year and it got thwarted
 basically by management.  They wanted it to come out AFTER the next
 studio album.  So, I'm hoping it will be out six months after the next
 studio album.  It's mastered. It's sequenced.  We've started on the
 artwork. It's ready to go.



 <Q> Were some of the songs on "7 And The Ragged Tiger" mastered and mixed
 more than once before release?

 <A> There were a couple of songs and they were recorded in this way.
 One of them was the Seventh Stranger, which was recorded in the South of
 France, and it was initially titled, "Spider Mouse." We took the tapes
 to Mont serrat, and we decided to change - um, the pattern would be
 something like this: Simon would go to sing on it and he'd say, "I don't
 like the way the song is moving here. Can we change it?" And we'd end up
 restructuring the chorus, or changing the chords , maybe even dropping in
 the drums to change the pattern. What I'm saying is that the song would
 have a start and end point. Then we moved on to somewhere else, umm, then
 we went to Australia. And there it was like, "Oh, we've got to change
 something else again." And we'd end up completely changing the middle.

 It's a little like when you scratch away the surface of a painting and
 it's like, "Oh,  there's another layer. Oh, and there's another thing
 under here, and oh, he must have changed this." That's really what
 happened on maybe three or four songs.



 <Q> Can you please describe Neurotic Outsiders'

 <A> They are healthily retrogressive. They are multi-faceted.  They are
 a think-tank for male menopause. They're a bunch of old slags.  They're
 kinda different. And they're a bunch of sweethearts.  How about that?



 <Q> Where did the four of you meet?

 <A> Matt Sorum was asked to put a band together to play at a benefit
 show in LA last summer and he asked a bunch of his musician friends to
 take part in this evening of events and the four of us became part of
 that evening's entertainment and we played for 25 minutes, I think, and
 had a great time doing it, the audience really liked it.  And the owner
 of the club said to me and Matt as we were leaving, "You guys are great.
 You should come back and do Monday nights here."  And we said "Yeah,
 yeah, sure, we'll think about it" and think about it we did. I was in
 London.  I'd gone to London to work with Duran Duran and while I was
 there I started thinking about what a good idea I thought it was and we
 all spoke and said, "What about it, let's do it." So we became the Monday
 night house band at The Viper Room for a couple of months last fall and
 we would to a lot of cover songs, we'd have guests coming up and
 singing...and then we started going out of town and doing more shows and
 slowly we brought in, we started playing one or two of my songs, one or
 two of Steve's songs and the band got an identity fairly quickly.  I
 mean, it's a fun band to play with. I love it because it's, you know, I
 get to sing, which is great. That is a real step for me.  And having
 three singers, the focus is changing all the time.  So it's a lot more
 spontaneous and the energy is more focused. Everybody just is more ON.
 So you've got to be wide awake.



 <Q> Did Steve have a bunch of songs lying around already written or were
 a lot of the songs written for the Neurotic Outsiders?

 <A> Yeah, he had a bunch of songs lying around like "Jerk" and "Story of
 my Life' and "Nasty Ho". He'd written those before the band started
 playing. But then I think he wrote "Angelina" and "Good News" after.



 <Q> Has anything been difficult because you're all still involved in
 other bands?

 <A> No, not really.  Duran Duran is going through a very VERY slow
 period. I mean I live in Los Angeles.  This is where my child lives. You
 know, I could go back to London and I could sit around and I could wait
 and for every seven days that I'd be in London, MAYBE Duran might do a
 few hours worth of work and I'm not prepared to do that anymore.  I'm not
 prepared to just sit around.  My life is in LA, unfortunately for Duran
 Duran.  I actually thought that my role in the latest album was finished.
 The music is all done.  It's all Simon's work that has to be done.  And
 he's the one dragging his feet.  It's out of my control.  I can either
 sit at home and bang my head against the wall twiddling my thumbs or I
 can just use the time. So I'm using the time.



 <Q> Who has the most fans from their own bands on the 4 of you?

 <A> Well, it's a standing fact that I have more female fans than anyone
 else, but it doesn't go any further than that.  They all joke about that
 and I feel a little embarrassed by it just because I don't want envy.
 I don't want to be the object of envy.   I'm uncomfortable with that. But
 we really like each other.  And just as a man in his thirties I have to
 tell you that to suddenly make three new mates is really really a great
 experience.  I think we all feel that and it's trememdously empowering.



 <Q> Of all the Duran songs to perform live, why was Planet Earth chosen?

 <A> It was the first one and it was really easy.  It's really only
 played as an overture.  In a way, what I'm saying when I do this is "OK,
 in a slightly different world, this song could have sounded like THIS!"
 If Duran Duran had have come together, three, four years earlier, like
 in 1977 rather than 1979, then it might have sounded like that.  It's
 just fun.  I thought about rearranging some of the other songs.  I
 thought "well maybe this could fit," but I'm not really interested. I
 just like doing that one and then it kind of gets it out of the way and
 then I'm not dealing with all the Duran fans saying to me afterwards
 "Howcome you didn't do any Duran songs?  You did Sex Pistols songs." We
 just do that and it just clears the air and it's a treat, I hope, if we
 do it good. And it just gets it out of the way.



 <Q> How do the other Durans react to this project and your solo project?

 <A> Simon's a supporter. He comes to see us. I guess in some ways, well,
 I don't really know is the honest truth.  They certainly give the
 impression that they support it so I suppose I should just take that at
 face value.



 <Q> How do you react to the other stuff they're doing, like Warren's
 music and TV Mania?

 <A> You know, power to him.  I'm not going to stand in the way of
 anybody reaching for artistic attention.



 <Q> What do you think of the sound of it, though?

 <A> You're putting me on the spot there because it's not really my kind
 of music. I don't really get it, but there are moments on the album that
 are really really stunning. Do you know what I mean?  I mean, Warren's a
 genius of the electric guitar and there's no doubt about it.  He's quite
 brilliant, but I don't listen, I'm not a fan of guitar music. You know
 what I mean?  It's not my bag. In the same way that I'm sure he wouldn't
 dig the Neurotic Outsiders. He doesn't listen to, that's not his bag.



 <Q> How was the transition from having Feelings Are Good and Other Lies
 to eventually ending up with Neurotic Outsiders putting out an album?

 <A> Well, it was beautiful the way that the one leads into the other.
 I finished the album and I wouldn't have dared allow myself the thought
 of like, "Wow, do you think I could play any of these live?"  That album,
 it was not made to be played live.  I just wanted to make an album and so
 when Neurotic Outsiders suddenly comes along, it's like "Wow, this is the
 next step." The next step appeared.  What do they say? "The teacher will
 appear when the student is ready."  That's how it seemed.



 <Q> How have the 2 projects helped you grow?

 <A> I'm a better singer than I was a year and a half ago.  I think I've
 got more confidence.  I think I'm less frustrated.  I'm happy, basically.
 I've gotten a lot of shit out that I knew I could do. I was really really
 getting frustrated.  I like doing what I do and I'm a very active member
 of the music industry and I just get frustrated putting out one album
 every two years.  That to me is a waste of it.  I'm just wasting my life.
 So, I've got the Neurotics, I've got the B5 label.  I've got a lot of
 good things going on.



 <Q> Are you going to find it difficult to go back to Duran after
 experiencing such a different style of music?

 <A> Well, I don't think it will be like going BACK to Duran.  I don't
 know that it will work like that.  I'm different.  I've changed and now
 I'm not going to change back. If it's too difficult then there's
 something wrong with it.  It shouldn't be difficult.



 <Q> How do you think Duran will be different because of this?

 <A> I really but don't know.  I think that Duran has to do something
 unusual or something different to stand out.  We're not always on the
 same page. We have a lot of disagreements about that way we want to do
 things and I don't know. Sometimes I just get sick and bored to death
 with even talking about it. It dominated my life for 20 years.  And I
 know all the jokes, all the punchlines, all the stories.  I'm looking
 forward to finishing this album. We've been working on it for nearly
 TWO YEARS. I've done a lot of other things in that time.  I'm looking
 forward to delivering that album because I've got a lot tied up in it.
 But I don't know where we go from there. We normally tour.  But I don't
 want to tour. I don't want to do the same old shit.  We have to find ways
 of doing things differently to make it interesting to them.



 <Q> Do you think we will hear your vocals more with Duran?

 <A> I wouldn't want to go out on the road for any length of time and not
 get to sing. That would have to be part of it for me, I think.  Even if
 I just get to do a couple of songs.  It's like I've started something
 inside me now and I don't really want to put it on hold unless it was
 just a limited period, you know like I see The Who doing Quadrophenia.
 If it was up to me, I'd put a retro show together.  I'd get Andy and
 Roger back and I'd do maybe 20 shows around the world.  That's what I'd
 do.  I'd make it big and impressive.  I don't know, but that's the phase
 I'm going through. And the last wow, certainly the 5 or 6 years I've
 been trying to distance, I felt we needed to distance ourselves from the
 old Duran Duran as much as possible.  You know, only play new songs and
 all this kind of shit and I'm not really feeling like that at the moment.
 I'm feeling really proud of the early Duran.  The last couple of tours
 we've done we've always rearranged the old songs.  We've never played
 them as they were.  Like we went on MTV Unplugged and we gave all the
 songs these really RADICAL rearrangements and I don't feel like I want to
 do that this time.  I'm tired of rearranging the old songs and I want to
 play them true.  But that's how I'm feeling today and we'd all have to
 sit around and talk about what we would want to do.



 <Q> Will Power Station 2 ever be realeased?

 <A> It's coming out in the next couple of months on Chrysalis.



 <Q> How did you remain friends with Andy after all the law suits?

 <A> Time is the greatest healer.  I really enjoyed working on the Power
 Station songs with him.  As you get older you just appreciate people that
 have been in your life and I'm not really much of a grudge holder. Too
 tiring.



 <Q> What do you do in yuor spare time?

 <A> I love to read.  At the moment I'm reading "Geek's Love" by Katherine
 Dunn. And I like to go to the movies.  I loved the film "Basquiat".
 Anybody that hasn't seen that who likes Duran Duran, they should see that
 because he's a big 80's icon.  I like going to the movies.  I go to the
 gym these days. I like to travel, but I haven't been doing so much of
 that lately.  I like going to the beach, taking my kid to the beach.



 <Q> How interested are you with being online or on the internet?

 <A> Not at all. I'm bored with it.




 <Q> What do you think are the biggest benefits or drawbacks of being
 in the spotlight?

 <A> Well, I think the benefits are that you touch people, so
 consequently, people that you don't know will come up to you and treat
 you like a friend. Drawbacks, well, I don't know too many drawbacks.
 Getting details of your personal life printed in the newspapers.




 <Q> What, to you, makes a good interview?

 <A> When I learn something.  A good interview can be good therapy, but
 they're very addictive because talking about yourself is such a
 privilege.  Most people don't get to do it.  I get to do it for hours.
 I can come off the telephone from a good interview and feel so drained
 and so alone that I just want to get on the phone and do another
 interview.  Very addictive so you really have to know, like any
 relationship, you've got to know when to let go, like I'm thinking now.
 You're gonna have to ask the last question cause I could just go on and
 on and on and on.

 <Q> Hello?

 <A> (bored) Hi.
 


 <Q> Hi, how are you?
 
 <A> (Still bored) Good. And you?
 



 <Q> OK. I guess, just to get this started, I have to ask you a question
 you've  been asked a million times: How did the covers project get
 started?

 <A> (Gets interested) Um, it's quite a long story, really, but I'll try
 and  abbreviate it. We've been talking about doing it since the
 beginning  of the  band; we were always fans of particularly the David
 Bowie covers  album, Pin  Ups , and the Bryan Ferry album, These
 Foolish Things , which  came out in  the early '70s when we were kids.
 There seemed to be  something really cool  about it at the time, back
 then, where you've got  artists whose albums you  liked and whose
 writing you liked and here they  were doing other people's  songs and
 introducing their audience to some  of their inspiration or
 influences. But it just seemed as though it was  their next album
 because  they had very much made the songs they covered  their own.
 They were very  different versions of those songs. 

 (Phone rings in background) 

 Excuse me; let me just get rid of this. Hold on. 

 Hello--sorry. So...from the beginning of the band... Most bands I
 suppose  used to start out playing other people's songs, and then from
 that,  learnt  to play their own songs. Well, we never really did that;
 we just  jumped in  at the deep end and started finding out how to
 write  ourselves. And it's  taken us 15 years, together as a band, to
 actually  get around to putting  together a collection of other
 people's songs that  inspired us in one way  or another or were
 important to us or that we  thought were certain  landmarks in music. 

 It really only happened out of the fact that we had finished The
 Wedding  Album , and we started doing a couple of covers for fun, one
 of actually  which was "Femme Fatale," that ended up on the The Wedding
 Album because  it  got finished before the thing was actually pressed.
 And then we  carried on  doing a few more and then we went on tour and
 we thought the  tour was only  going to be six months. It ended up
 being almost 18  months, and during that  time, when we got a few days
 here and there, we  went into the studio and  picked a cover and just
 did it and just sort of  added to our collection  that we were stock
 piling. And at the end of it,  we had over half an album  and we just
 went to France and finished it up.
 



 <Q> How many studios did you work in for this? I imagine...

 <A> Oh, it doesn't bear thinking about. All over the place--Los
 Angeles,  New  York, Minneapolis, Paris, Entibe, London. A few
 different ones in  Paris as  well. You'd just grab a day wherever you
 could; I mean, it all  sounds like  it was a horribly expensive,
 sprawling album. Actually, it  probably wasn't  that expensive at all,
 but it was sprawling just because  we were on tour. 




 <Q> Do you think that having to stop and then start up somewhere else
 on  the other side of the world, do you think that affected the way it
 ended  up, the final project?
 
 <A> Yeah, it totally affected it. For this project, I think it's kind
 of  nice.  If it had been a studio album, where you'd wanted it...um, I
 mean  a self-written studio album, where you want the thing to have a
 cohesiveness  and a vibe throughout it, then I think it could have
 been  potentially  disasterous. But because this album really...it's
 more like  a greatest hits  than anything else to me. It's a collection
 of songs  that don't...It really  takes some getting used to to play
 it, because  you really are jumping  around from one thing to another.
 



 <Q> That's very true.

 <A> I mean, the thing that bonds it for me is our sound, the fact that
 when we  all play together, we create a certain ambience whatever the
 music is,  whether it's a Brazillian thing or a rap thing or a rock
 thing, Simon's  voice I suppose being at the center of it all. But I
 really think that it's  quite nice that we were able to give different
 songs such radically  different feelings because they demanded it, you
 know? We didn't pick 12  songs that were all from the same period or
 the  same sort of artists; I  mean, it spans three decades and
 everything from  Bob Dylan to Public Enemy.  So yeah, in a way, I think
 it helped.
 



 <Q> Do you think that producing it yourselves, did that bring a sense
 of  cohesiveness to it?

 <A> Yeah, the thing is I think we've always from the very start, been
 very heavily involved in our own production. We just always felt that
 there should be someone else in the room incase an uncontrollable
 arguement breaks out about what direction something should go in. But
 when we got to make The Wedding Album , we were doing the demos
 ourselves  and we realized  that there really wasn't a lot of point
 having a  producer at that stage  because we were all agreeing exactly
 where we  wanted to go and it had been  a long time we'd been together,
 I should  say, by then. And we really sort  of understand what the weak
 points are  and what the strong points are and  who's good at arranging
 certain  things and who's good at other things. So  we really had a lot
 more  empathy than we probably imagined. We were able to  do it
 ourselves, and  since then, we haven't thought about using another
 producer. I'm sure we  will one day just for the fun of it to work
 with  other people, but I  think we've realized that we're probably
 happier  producing our own  stuff.




 <Q> As producers then, how much of the technical work do you do
 yourselves in  terms of mixing or programming or whathaveyou?

 <A> Well, we're very heavily involved in all the programming obviously;
 anything that ends up on the record has come from us or people working
 directly with us. There are songs obviously that we mixed, the songs we
 remixed and when we've chosen somebody that we're incredibly
 comfortable  with, we like to give them a little bit of leeway to do
 interesting  things.  For example, the song "Perfect Day" which was
 mixed by David  Richards, who  mixed most of The Wedding Album . He's a
 real meticulous  one; I mean, he  spent weeks because he's got his own
 studio in  Switzerland, he has the  luxury of being able to spend as
 much time as he  wants on a mix. So instead  of just saying, 'Right,
 we've got two days to  do this,' he'll take a couple  of weeks or
 something. Not solidly, but  he'll get it out, put it away and  mark it
 all up and get it out  again...he spends a lot of time on detail,
 which I really rather like  and I think he did a wonderful job with
 "Perfect  Day" this time. We  didn't have anything to do with the mix. 

 (Phone rings) 

 Excuse me; I'll get rid of this. 

 Hello, sorry. So it's nice to have people at a certain stage, I think, 
 at another level of input. I mean, I certainly wouldn't take anything
 away  from David or Anthony Resta who mixed most of this album. They
 added  something to it that if we'd mixed them by ourselves, they would
 have been  different. I think they would have been more like our demo
 mixes. But it's  nice to add that little bit of dust on it at the end,
 I  think, when people  hear drum sounds differently and vocal effects
 differently. That's the sort  of stuff that of course we've done it
 ourselves many, many times, but  that's, in reliqueshing the tracks to
 a  mixer, you've got to give them a  little bit of space if you want to
 get  the best out of them.
 



 <Q> Did you record this digitally or analog?

 <A> Ah, there's a bit of both on there. It ended up getting mixed
 mainly  analog. We're doing our new album totally analog. I've kind of
 had it  with  digital at the moment, actually. I'm using all analog
 synthesizers  again;  actually not all--mainly analog synthesizers, I
 should say. I  really have  found over the years, I've always tried to
 say, 'Digital,  it's great of  course; you've got all these editing
 options and wonderful  things like  that' but now, because of
 computers, we've got every editing  option we want  anyway, whether we
 do it digital or analog. I find that  with digital, it  just does not
 have that warmth.
 



 <Q> Yep, that's the big complaint; that's what everybody says.

 <A> Yeah, abosolutely, but I think it's true! I don't think it's a
 falicy  at  all. You listen to things--I listen to a mix we've done
 that's analog  and  that was recorded analog, and I listen to a digital
 one next to it;  there  is no question that the drums and the vocals
 suffer and it just  doesn't  breath the same. And as much as everyone
 tried to convince  everybody about  the amount of the sampling rate and
 how perfect it is  and how only dogs can  tell the difference--then, we
 must all be barking  mad, is all I've got to  say.
  



 <Q> One thing to ask you about; it was a real surprise to find Roger
 Taylor on this album. How did that come about?

 <A> We've actually asked him to play on every album since he's left, I
 think.  He's declined, and this time we saw him somewhere because
 obviously we bump  into him in England. We saw him at something or
 other  and asked him, said,  'Hey, we just going over to Paris, you
 know, next  week to finish this off;  fancy coming and playing on a
 couple of tracks?  There's a couple of really  nice songs that we
 haven't done yet', one of  which was "Perfect Day" and  the other one
 was "Watching The Detectives"  that he played on. And he said,  'Yeah,
 OK.' (laughs) It's quite a  surprise to us, really. It was great; I
 think it was really good for him  to get back in the studio and do
 something, 'cause I don't think he's  been playing a lot until recently
 when  he said he'd been practicing.  Yeah, he played really well. I've
 always  found him a very interesting  drummer, very inventive and we
 had pretty  decent ideas on what we wanted  to do with both those
 tracks, and he  executed them really well, I think.
 



 <Q> It had been so long since you had worked together; when you got
 together  and did this, did that experience point out changes in the
 band  since  then--styles of working or how you approach things?

 <A> Oh yes--absoultely, totally. Worlds of change. I think Roger was
 quite  shocked actually about the way that we worked. It was very
 different on the  two tracks as well, because those tracks were
 actually  initated by  computers. They were the later ones at a time
 when we  weren't all in the  same room at the same time playing
 together, so I put  them together with  one of my programmers, Mark
 Tinley, and we were just  messing around with  things in a tiny, little
 room, putting down backing  tracks to test whether  we wanted to do
 them. So I put down "Perfect  Day"--all the pads and pianos  and the
 little guitar harmonics things and  samples. I played it to Simon  and
 said, 'OK, lets hear you sing with  it.' We checked the key and made
 sure everything was right. It sounded  so good immedately that I
 thought,  'Wow! Well, we should use this track  as it is--just dump it
 on to  multi-track and then we'll add the drums  and guitar and the
 bass to it  afterwards.' And the same thing with  "Watching The
 Detectives," those two  in particular. 

 So they were done in a very different way for us, because we generally
 work with computers but playing live at the same time. It was kind of
 interesting, because John was in Los Angeles at the time, so the tape
 had  to go to Los Angeles to have the bass put on it. We all went over
 there.  It  had to wait until much later when we were going over to do
 some  mixing of  another track. So here it was--it had been to London
 and had  the guitar put  on it, and then we took it over to L.A. to
 have the bass  finished. It was  really almost like 'paint by numbers.'
 It was quite  cool actually, because  with "Perfect Day," I think it
 gave it a very  sureal feeling, and "Watching  The Detectives" was
 obviously a much  different one to do. 




 <Q> So do you normally piece them together or do you work in the studio
 all together?

 <A> It varies. Initally, when we write. That's what was different about
 this  project that enabled us to do it was that the song was already
 there. When  we write, we always write together, and if somebody's got
 something that  they did on their own three months ago or whatever,
 they  bring it into the  room and say, 'Right, this is how it goes.' We
 all  play it together and  develop it from there. It was different with
 this  because it was already  there. I just thought one day, 'Right,
 I'm going  to put "Perfect Day"  down.' Normally, I wouldn't really be
 able to do  that. Of course, I could  put down a totally new piece of
 music, but it  wouldn't be as relevant,  because I think that one of
 the joys of being a  band is playing together  and actually all getting
 in there and doing it,  which is how we've done all  the new stuff that
 we're working on at the  moment.
 



 <Q> Certainly one of the things that you mentioned before was that you
 were interested in those previous albums of covers because they had
 such  different takes with those covers of songs. Likewise, that was
 something  I really found with yours--"911" having that blues riff
 underneath it.  Was it  a priority to make these songs sound
 significantly different?

 <A> The thing is, with the type of songs we picked, we could have gone
 and  picked a bunch of Beatles songs or Rolling Stones songs and songs
 that  everybody knew and done fascimilies of them and probably enormous
 hits with  them because they would have been nostalgic and reminded
 everybody how  great the originals were--but it just seemed entirely
 pointless to us.  

 Also, we were very aware of how much we liked the originals, how
 precious  they were to us. And so we didn't really, with a lot of the
 songs, want  to  get too close to the originals. We wanted to take them
 in a different direction so that it wasn't so much of a comparison, but
 more 'Oh, this  is  a different version.' But the criteria above all
 else was two  things--one:  Can we bring something new to this song,
 whether it's a  similar arrangement  or not. Can we bring something to
 it to make it  valid? Can we make it a  90's Duran Duran version of
 this that's going to  be fun and different and  is going to introduce
 our audience to the song. 

 And Two: Can Simon sing this really well? because you're talking about
 people who've got very different ranges, and then you think about the
 rap  things and then you think about the Dylan one. I mean, that's got
 to be  the  weirdest Dylan one of all, I've got to say. The voice on
 that, I  don't know  where it came from. And then, a lot of artists
 that didn't  make it on  there. We were just trying to figure out what
 we could do  with those songs.  There were a lot we lost along the way.
 




 <Q> Really?

 <A> Yah--we started off a Lennon song, "How," and Simon--I think
 rightly  too;  I kind of sided with him--felt the lyric was much too
 personal to  Lennon  and our version sort of seemed redundant. But then
 with other  songs, there  were things we felt we could really do to
 bring it into a  different  light--songs like "White Lines," where the
 original was  totally electronic.  Well, the first thing that came to
 us was, 'Let's do  a really electric  version,' with the guitar riff
 playing the  groove--what the bass would have  done in the original.
 Involving them,  Grandmaster Flash and Melle Mel and  The Furious Five,
 with us, it was an  experience to actually go through it.  The Lou Reed
 song, I'd been  talking about doing with Simon since 1985 when  we did
 Arcadia; I've  always thought it was just such a beauty. I mean,
 everybody seems to  know "Walk On The Wild Side" from that album, but
 actually not that many  people seem to be familiar with that one. Well,
 to  me it's a tragedy,  because it's just such a beautiful song that
 everyone  should know it. So  I suppose that was part of the thing
 behind that. 




 <Q> Have you gotten any comments from the folks who did do the
 originals?

 <A> Oh yeah--most of them. They've been fabulous. It's been very, very
 complimentary and we're very touched by it because, obviously to us, I
 suppose their approval means a lot more than any review will ever have
 from  anyone. Yeah, they've said really wonderful things. Lou Reed said
 it was  the best cover of any of his songs that anyone had ever done.
 And  Bob Dylan  said that "Lay Lady Lay," our version beat his by a
 mile.  Flavor Flav said  something interesting too; he said it was an
 honor and  a pleasure that we'd  done his song, but thank you for
 bringing the  message back to people's  attention, which considering
 the slating we've  had from some of the music  press for doing a black
 rap song, I think he  looked at it in the way that  we looked at, to
 say 'What's the difference  that a white rock band's doing  it? It's a
 cool piece of music and its a  great message.' 


(Interuption from PR guy asking for the next question to be the last)
 



 <Q> OK, let me ask you about sequencing of songs--the order of songs on
 the album. Is that a big priority?

 <A> When we first started out, I always used to think that sequencing
 was  the  most important thing in that you've got to get people in the
 right  mood and  you've got to bring them down a little bit and then
 bring them  back up. I  mean, you can talk about it and talk about it
 for weeks until  you're blue  in the face. But now, I sort of find
 myself relaxing about  it a lot more  and just seeing what naturally
 happens, seeing which songs  seem to suit  each other one after the
 other. We think about the keys  quite a lot; for  some reason, we
 always seem to end up with everything  in D. Probably  because it suits
 Simon I suppose, but we try to break  that up a little bit  because I
 think there's something a little subtle  about it that makes the
 tonality seem a little monotonous if you do have  everything in D all
 together, or any key for that matter. I suppose  that's a factor.  

 I always think about the first few, because I think they set the mood
 of  the record, whether you want it to be up or you want it to be
 mid-paced  or  whatever. This is an almost impossible album to do that
 with though,  to  over think, because there were so many directions.
 How we managed to  cram  them on one album, all those different songs,
 I still don't really  know.  But some albums, I think it has to come
 naturally, to be honest. I  think it  just either feels right or it
 doesn't. I know with The Wedding  Album , when  we came up with a list
 between us, we all came back with  the same comment  the day
 afterwards. There was one track to be moved or  something because it
 didn't feel right coming out of another one. And  that was it and we
 all loved the order. It's good when it happens like  that. 


 

 <Q> Great. Well, thank you very much then. I appreciate your time.

 <A> (happy sounding) My pleasure. Ok, take care.

 Questions and Answers - With Warren Cuccurullo
 ==============================================

     From: Planet Earth Homepage
       At: http://hal.cs.uiuc.edu/~smarch/Duranduran.html

   Career: Franks Zappa's Band
           Missing Persons
           Duran Duran

 Projects: Medazzaland, Bored with Prozac and the Internet
           Thanks 2 Frank, Machine Language



 <Q> What did you learn as a musician and a person from Frank [Zappa] ?

 <A> Um, well, since I got into his music as a listener and a fan at a
 pretty early age, I think he definitely had a big impact on the direction
 that I went in as far as my curiosity goes into other kinds of music,
 music that  I might have never stumbled upon or even had any kind of
 interest in like classical music, modern classical music or maybe even
 doo-wop would have passed me by. Frank was heavily into doo-wop sort kind
 of fifties stuff and I was more into the sixties music.  His guitar
 playing was very advanced and had elements of other kinds of music in it
 as well like Indian, I heard a big Indian influence which I kind of had a
 taste of from the Beatles, ya know with the George Harrison thing and the
 way he was using Indian musicians on some of his compositions.  But I
 heard that in Frank's soloing, I heard that kind of Raga type style. Um,
 so I think just listening to his music helped me grow because some of it
 is very complex as well, and it made me want to  figure out the song and
 why was he playing that that way, and encouraged me to get a teacher
 again.  As a person, getting to meet him after being a  fan for so many
 year, and then getting to be in his band and seeing what a serious, fun
 person he was, and how he would lead his musicians.  The  way he would be
 able to get things out of different players.  The discipline that he had
 beyond anyone else in the band because he was the band leader. The way he
 would always be there, and would always be thinking, no matter  if
 somebody was doodling around on their guitar or their drum kit or
 something, Frank would still be sittin' there thinking about how are we
 going to get this song to really happen, what does it need...just seeing
 that, and  I had done that on my level in the bands I had. I was like the
 band leader in all my groups when I was a kid, and I wrote all the music,
 but to see it on  that level, with a guy who had at the time about 30
 albums behind him...



 <Q> Was it just different because someone else was really pushing your
 limits as opposed to you just pushing your limits?

 <A> Yeah, that's definitely, that's a great point, but I mean, just being
 able to  play Frank's music just as a listener when you try to do it in
 one of your own bands before you even played with him was pushing
 yourself, you knew  first of all, it was legendary what he expected of
 his musicians, especially drummers, so there was definately this kind
 of...not a barrier, it was like  some kind of summit that you had to get
 to in order to even be with him, to  be in that space with him.  So you
 did that before, that was like your preparation and for me it was really
 bizarre because I never expected to  be in his band. There's like,
 drummers all over the world who like, the only thing they aspire to is
 to play with Frank Zappa, and they knew that the audition would be like,
 the worst day of their life, because they might think, well, maybe he
 wrote an even harder piece of music, just to screw you up. I figured that
 every guitar player in his band before me was a lead singer. So I always
 thought, I'd love to do something for Frank, like some kind of job, I
 never thought I'd get to play guitar in his band.



 <Q> So what was your audition like for Frank?

 <A> It was incredible.  It was one of the best days of my life.  I think
 from hanging out with him before I got in his band, and playing him tapes
 of what I do... he kinda knew where I was at, he knew I could control
 distortion, he heard that I was a lead guitar player, he heard what I was
 doing and some of the interesting time signatures I was playing. He never
 heard me play any composition.  He just heard me jamming on cassettes,
 shitty little cassettes, but he liked what he heard.  And then we played
 together  one time backstage when I was at one of his shoes in Stonybrook
 University in Long  Island and I was backstage before the show and I
 picked up one of the guitarist's guitars and Frank said play this, and he
 had me play some riff and we just jammed for awhile for about 20 minutes.


 I took it out..I took it way out.  I went off the riff and just started
 playing these weird chords, and it was hit and miss, but it was fun. So
 that was the  actual first time we played togther.  Then he called me up
 one day when I  was in New York jamming with my friends at my parents'
 house and he called me and said I want you come out tomorrow to audition
 and I was like, "okay." When I actually did audition, all he did was, I
 went up to his house and  we were hanging out in his livingroom, and he
 had a guitar and I had a guitar and he'd play something, and he said "can
 you play this?" and I said  "oh yeah I know that song..." and I just
 played it for him, and he'd play a riff, ya know...he'd just make
 something up, and I'd play it just like that. He asked me if I knew this
 song or that song, and I said "yep, know em all" and he said, "well, you
 got the job" and that was it..




 <Q> Was Zappa ahead of his time?

 <A> I think he's a few centuries ahead of his time.  He was writing
 music for himself and the music he was influenced by was so diverse.
 Some of it was so out of the mainstream that the sum of those influences
 coming through a mind like his at the time that it did...there is no
 place for it,  it is only Frank Zappa music...we all tried that...we all
 tried to be unique, but there was just something about what he does,
 that was like  a signature.  To this day, I saw a performance the other
 night, a week ago of his music and the stuff that was written in 1967
 sounds as fresh as the stuff that was written in 1992.  His music will
 be played in halls all around the world forever.



 <Q> Do you have a memorable moment from working with Frank?

 <A> One of the best times I ever had with Frank was when he came to
 Canarsie. at my parents house where I grew up and we were jamming in my
 basement where he called me, where I used to make all those tapes, and
 my brother was down there playing drums, a friend of ours was playing
 bass, and all my friends from the neighborhood were over at my house
 because they knew that Frank was coming over.  It was beyond a dream.
 It was like 30 year old men in tears hanging out...It was amazing...



 <Q> Why did you leave Zappa's band to form Missing Persons?

 <A> The one thing you know with Frank is that his bands change all the
 time, and  Terry me and Dale had such a great friendship and we had
 written some  really good songs in the time I had off with Frank and we
 started rehearsing these songs and it sounded amazing and we just
 thought, it was 1980, and  there were all these new bands coming out,
 and none of them could play  like we could.  We just thought man...ya
 know...Dale sings really strange,  she's like Flying Lizards and the
 B-52s, we got a great image and we can play our asses off, let's go get
 a record deal...and it didn't happen like that, yeah, we could play our
 asses off, we looked great, but nobody gave a shit. It took us awhile to
 get signed.



 <Q> Was there ever a point when you thought about ditching the Missing
 Persons idea?

 It was only at the very beginning when Frank called me and said I am
 ready to go out on the road, I want you in the band.  I said, I'm going
 to come over tomorrow night and I will talk about it. I went up there
 with a tape, and I explained to him what had been doing, and he really
 liked it, and he couldn't believe that Dale could sing in time, because
 he was the one that discovered Dale, and put her on, ya know she sang
 the first words she'd ever sang was "Warren Cuccurrulo" on Catholic
 Girls...he just loved  the sound of her voice.  So, he couldn't believe
 that she was singing and  he like the stuff, but let me tell you he said,
 its not easy...and he took out a record and it was a Devo album, and he
 said "ya see these guys, they  were the hottest thing last year, 2 years
 ago and now nobody even wants to  know about them..."  and um, it was
 true, ya know how it is, it's very trendy and of the moment, and I have
 to say he was right, but he said if you want to do it I wish you all the
 luck in the world, you've got my blessings, and if there is anything I
 can do to help just let me know. And i said  yeah Frank, I really do want
 to do it, and that was it, I made the decision  at that point.  I could
 have had another world tour under my belt, ya know to go out with Frank
 again I would have learned a lot more, but I think I did the right thing.
 I don't regret not staying with him at that point, even though now that
 he is dead, I wish I had some more great times with him,  but ya know I
 had other great times with him even though I wasn't in the  band.



 <Q> Is any Missing Persons stuff going to be released?

 <A> I am putting together a three record compilation of things. It's not
 going to be for a little while yet, probably next year, the first one is
 going to be a live stuff and a couple of new studio tracks that we never
 released.  I think it's time for that stuff to get out there and
 presented in the right way.



 <Q> Where do you see yourself in ten years?

 <A> (singing) On Broadway...



 <Q> Doing your new musical?

 <A> Hopefully me and Nick will be on the third broadway play by then.
 I think that I will be doing exactly what I am doing now, making a lot
 of music with different projects.  Nick and I want to get into
 soundtracks and  writing movies and all kinds of stuff.



 <Q> What accomplishments are you most proud of?

 <A> Um, that's a tough one, I am very proud of just being able to be a
 working  musician and composer...just be able to do that when you see
 how many people are out there trying to do things, trying to be actors,
 trying to be musicians, it is very difficult and I am just so thankful
 and proud that I can do it.  That is an endless flow of inspiration in
 music that comes through me and I am so happy that that happened, you
 know survival, I am really happy to survive in the music business,
 especially now,  doing exactly what I want to be doing, exactly the way
 I want to do it, no compromising.



 <Q> Do you plan on playing some solo shows anytime soon?

 <A> Yeah, I am going to be doing five or six, ya know, it's really not
 financially feasible but I think we can squeeze a few in while I am doing
 the promotion.  I have two different bands, I have one in England and
 one in Los Angeles that know the music, so that makes it a little bit
 convenient.   But, its just very hard to go out and break even in small
 clubs.  I'd love to play the music from that album five nights a week for
 three months.




 <Q> At what age did you get your first guitar?

 <A> 11, no 10...drums at 9, guitar at 10...



 <Q> Did you take lessons or teach yourself from a book?

 <A> I took lessons straight away and took lessons for about a year and
 a half and learned how to play all the Beatles songs and the Monkees
 songs, whatever I liked...a couple of Hendrix things and I just started
 playing by  ear after that...I figured I know all these songs, I could
 just start a band now...



 <Q> Did you always know you wanted to be a musician when you grew up?

 <A> I had fantasized and always dreamed that that's what it would be. At
 the time when you're like between the ages of let's just say, 13 and 17,
 um when you really have all your friends that are gonna be your friends
 for the next few years, you know you are in high school and you have your
 band, that's when you get sucked into that fantasy, like wow this is
 great this is what  I like doing...ya know...you gotta do homework and
 shit, and you have to  go to school, but most of the time you figured a
 way not to do it, like  I did.  I figured out ways of not going to school
 at 8 o'clock in the morning and showing up at 11.  I paid for it my
 senior year, but...ya know you just try to finagle your way out of
 homework, and doing good on tests or cheating or anything to get through
 school and all you would really be waiting for is  to get home and jam
 and play. or do that show, we used to do battles of the  bands, and
 that's where you really get this delusion that this is it, I am grown up
 now.  You almost feel like that's all you'll ever be doing. I don't
 know...maybe it was the pot, I don't know.  I don't know why I  thought
 I'd make it because there were so many other great players around too.
 I kind of made my way up the ranks of neighborhood guitar players to
 where by the time I was 18, everybody was talking about me.  I remember
 when I'd always be talking about other people and I'd go see other
 people,  and then all of the sudden those people would be playing with
 me when I was  17.  By the time I was 18, everyone else was talking
 about me, saying wow,  this guy Warren, you gotta hear what he's
 playing, so I did it in that  sense which was cool, but what did that
 mean? What does that Canarsie  guitar hero, what does that mean...There
 eventually comes a time when you  get the parental bullshit, like "Get
 a job, I'll break your head."



 <Q> How did your family respond to your dream of being a musician?

 <A> Well, that was it...it was hard because you have to figure, your
 father was coming home at 7 o'clock at night from slaving all day and he
 sits down  at the table and hears "boom", and the plates start shaking
 because there's like five long-haired, pot smoking kids in the basement
 playing a Black  Sabbath tune...it just makes it a little bit harder for
 them to digest,  ya know maybe this kid's gonna do this for the rest of
 his life.



 <Q> What do they say about that stuff now?

 <A> Well, for them, it's the greatest.  It's almost as great as it is
 for me. They love it, they absolutely love it.



 <Q> What were you doing before you joined Frank's band?

 <A> I was just playing, little gigs like battles of the bands.  The
 biggest thing I did at that time before Frank was I played at the
 Calderone Theatre in Long Island and did a Rocky Horror Convention and
 Meatloaf was there and Richard O'Brein and Tim Curry, and it was the
 first annual Rocky Horror  convention and I put a band together for it
 and backed up Richard O'Brein playing all those Rocky Horror songs, I
 got to wear the eye-shadow. So that was the only big hall I had ever
 played, other than that I was  playing churches and whatever.



 <Q> Tell me about the TV Mania Project that you're working on...

 <A> TV Mania is a new band that me and Nick formed. The name of the
 project is Bored with Prozac and the Internet.  It's a 3 part, 3 album
 rock opera, ya know, Broadway type extravagance.  And, it's finished
 basically.  The first album is a lot of television samples, where we've
 used them, these people have become the lead singers on different songs,
 the way we've used the samples.  It's very kind of alternative dance
 direction.  Some stuff there's no guitar on it, it's all synths and
 weird noises and maybe some strange little vocal sample other things
 are like just bass, with a fuzz box, and  a drum kit.  It's very strange
 the way we're going to credit is like  Nick Rhodes instrument/voice,
 Warren Cuccurrulo instrument/voice.



 <Q> So you will both be singing on this?

 <A> Oh yeah, we both sing on it...



 <Q> Never heard Nick sing before...

 <A> You've never heard Nick...Nick never heard himself sing before...
 with all these weird boxes we use, you know, you go through it, and all
 of the sudden you sing one note and 6 come out, we're doing a lot of
 strange things here, so Nick's singing on it, and  myself  and Nick's
 girlfriend is singing on one song through the wonder  of technology. But
 most of the singing is actually is the television.  The second album,
 we're looking into getting a coupla different singers who are well known
 to do the stuff because it's more of like a...for lack of a bettter term,
 it's more like "Dark Side of the Moon", the second album...that kind of
 vibe.  The third one is more or less orchestral, ambient, thematic type
 stuff from the first two plus some new ones.



 <Q> When is Medazzaland going to be released?

 <A> Probably being released in September...that's the latest it could
 be...it could be a little bit sooner...it could be a little bit later...



 <Q> There's a song on there called Tabular Ratha, right?

 <A>No, it's now called "Time Life"...it's kind of like an old Blondie
 song, almost...it's kind of got that vibe, kind of like Blondie meets
 The Clash.




 <Q> You said in your Guitar magazine interview that Medazzaland was
 going to shock a lot of people...why?

 <A> I just think the edge...the edge that this album has...it's not like
 any of the other ones, and it's not going to have any of the production
 values that the other ones had...it's not overproduced in any way shape
 or form... it's very raw sounding.  It's tons of energy...there's going
 to be ten songs on it and there's not a lemon in the bunch...not that I
 don't like lemons.



 <Q> Describe Meddazaland if you can in one word...

 <A> Medazzled...medazzling...that's the word...




 <Q> How would you like to be remembered?

 <A> Daily....that's the best way to be remembered, isn't it???

 Whats Happening Now?
 ====================

 Duran Duran are never idle.  At the moment, they are they are in the
 studio recording the next album which they believe will be finished by
 the end of the summer and out in 1999.  The band re-convened on 15th
 March 1998 to start work on the new project and already have most of
 the tracks layed down.  All of the music material has been written and
 the pre-production of it has been completed.  They are still working on
 the lyrics as this usually takes the longest amount of time.  Warren has
 been quoted saying one of the tracks on the album will be entitled
 Russian Brunette.


 Various
 =======
 The big news this year is that Duran have split from their long time
 record producers Capitol Records.  See Article @{" Capitol Offence " link "A.Capitol Offence" 0}.


 The group has recently released a collection of B-sides in the U.S only
 called Essentials.  This is a collection of their early 12" material from
 1981 to 1984 including the Wild Boys Wilder mix and The Reflex dance mix.
 A real collectors item and one which is already out of stock in most
 stores.  The package also comes with a multimedia CD with a hidden new
 version of New Moon On Monday which can be played through a PC. The band
 would also like to point out that they were not responsible for production
 and any problems accessing the Hidden track should be directed to the
 manufacturers.
 Set List:
 Planet Earth (Night Version)
 Girls on Film (Night Version)
 My Own Way  (Night Version)
 Rio (12" dance version)
 Hungry Like the Wolf (Night Version)
 New Religion (Night Version)
 Hold Back the Rain (re-mix)
 Is There Something I Should Know? (Monster Mix)
 Union of the Snake (Monkey Mix)
 The Reflex (Dance Mix)
 Wild Boys (12" mix)
 New Moon On Monday (new Night Version)


 At current time of writting, the European release of Medazzaland is still
 on hold until they find another distributer.  Their split from Capitol/EMI
 has ment that any further plans they have for the release will have to
 wait until they decide how to proceed with it.  Speculations suggest that
 they could either release it though Virgin (who have helped promote their
 recent material) or use one of their own production companies to
 distribute a much smaller amount.  Dispite low sales in the U.S, the
 band are still hoping for a re-release in with the inclusion of an extra
 track which may or may not be @{" Ball and Chain " link "BALL & CHAIN" 0}.


 Another new weapon in the Duran arsenal is the addition of a new Web page
 at: http://www.duranduran.com.  Although the site is still under
 construction (even after all this time), there are still a few reasons to
 give it a visit.  See my @{" World Wide Wannabe's " link "A.World Wide Wannabes" 0} article.


 The web has also helped pay tribute to the band in the form of a new
 tribute album.  The collection of duran material performed by new artists
 is currently in production but their efforts can be viewed on their web
 site at http://www.toto.net/svanity/home.html.


 The (in)famous Duran Duran nailpolish is set to make another appearance
 in 1998.  The special Electric Barbarella Pink has had a number of legal
 problems leading upto its release but these have apparently been sorted
 out.  The product is set to appear June/July 1998 from Hard Candy.


 Don't forget, Duran Duran information can be delivered direct to your
 door by sending a SASE to:  Duran Information Society, PO Box 419, NYC,
 NY 10021.



 Simon LeBon
 ===========
 A new hollywood movie entitled 'Love Kills' will shortly by with us, with
 the added bonus that Simon will contribute to the soundtrack.  He has
 written a number of songs for the film including Dream Boyz and Cupid's A
 Hitman.  For a more information, see @{" Duran and the Movies " link "A.Duran goes movies" 0}.  He is also
 hopeing to perform Dream Boyz at 1998's cannes film festival.


 Simon is currenly writting the lyrics to the next Duran album.



 John Taylor
 ===========
 John's own recording company, B5 records, are still recruiting new talent
 at the moment.  They have also vastly updated their web site and
 renamed it to: http://www.trusttheprocess.com.  For more information
 about this, check my @{" World Wide Wannabe's " link "A.World Wide Wannabes" 0} article.


 John is also hopeing to tour the West Coast of America beginning May and
 and ending June 1998.  For full dates, see the web site.


 JT is also busy producting a new Clash tribute album.  After the success
 of Dream Home Heartaches (the Roxy Music tribute) which helped the LA
 Childrens Hospital's High Risk Youth program, he is set to record a new
 Clash tribute and has already signed such artists as Foo Fighters, the
 Wallflowers, Tricky, Poe, Rancid, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Melissa
 Etheridge and Bush.  No completion date has been set.



 Warren Cuccurullo
 =================
 Sad news as Warrens father passed away on 5th of December 1997.  All
 contributions and messages were gratefully recieved.


 A new Missing Person's compilation album is out called "Late Nights,
 Early Days" and features a collection of their early material.  Set as a
 'must have' item for fans, it is only available in Japan.


 Warren has finished the guitar and basslines for the new album.




 Nick Rhodes
 ===========
 After Simons involvment with SYN, Nick and Warren have set up their own
 record label called LoFi Records.  They are currenly working with and
 recruiting many new bands and already have projects underway.  They
 are also helping as producers for established groups.


 Their long awaited TV Mania project is also complete.  The three part
 rock opera will be released separetelly over the next year or so and the
 first part, entitled TV Mania - Bored with Prozac and the Internet is
 complete and will be released through LoFi Records by June 1998.
 


 Roger Taylor
 ============
 Having been away from music for a number of years, Roger has joined /
 helped create a new group called Freebase.  The group have completed a
 number of songs with the first single set to be a cover of Sweet's
 'Love Is Like Oxygen'.  Unfortinately, problems have led to the groups
 cancelation of the project and early reports indicate Freebase has
 broken up.



 Andy Taylor
 ===========
 Andy, as always, is busy with many new projects including solo work for
 other groups including Then Jerico which Andy was in for a time.  He is
 also on Then Jerico's latest album.

 Biography - Nick Rhodes                        @{"<See Picture of Nick>" system "extras/ppshow pics/nick.iff"}
 =======================

  FROM: The Duran Temple
  AT: http://carroll1.cc.edu/~kwalker/duranduran.html


 One of the founding members of our beloved band, Nick is truly artistic,
 mysterious and yet still open and sensitive about many things. Nick (born
 Nicholas James Bates) made a friend in 1970 that would affect his life
 forever, Nigel John Taylor. The two boys were constant friends. In
 1977-78 they decided to form a band. Nick worked as a DJ at the famous
 Rum Runner, the hip and trendy nightclub specialising in the New Wave of
 New Romanticism. He and his best friend knew that they could put together
 a band, and they even formed a five year plan, which included selling out
 Madison Square Garden. The two not only succeeded, but exceeded their
 goals! 

 A combination of Good Looks with Pure Genious made for one of the most
 influential Rock Bands to come out of Great Britain. Nick being on
 synthesizer gives Duran its unique mix of heavy dance rhythms and
 beautifully sensitive melodies. In addition to working with Duran, Nick
 has produced the one hit wonder Kajagoogoo, the tremendous group Arcadia
 and is working on an even bigger project, a rock opera titled Bored with
 Prozac and the Internet with band member Warren Cuccurullo. 

 Truly an artist at heart Nick is well known in many artistic circles and
 was good friends with the late great Andy Warhol. Nick has graced many of
 the most famous artistic venues and charity auctions, and even helped
 the late Keith Haring with some fabulous charity projects.  Nick has also
 been an advocate for great causes such as the RSPCA showing his
 sensitivity goes beyond music to social responsibility as well. 

 In addition to his work, Nick was married in 1984 (which ended unhappily
 in 1992). Out of his marriage he has a daughter Tatjana Leigh Orchid, he
 shares custody with his ex-wife. 

 Currently Nick is busy working on his Rock Opera with Warren, as well as
 the sequel to Medazzaland.  Proving again and again that his energy and
 creative genius just doesn't end.

 attending drama school when an ex-girlfriend (who worked for the Rum
 Runner Nightclub) told him of a band that was looking for a lead singer.
 Simon being quite a sensitive individual already had books full of many
 of our fave Duran Duran Songs written down as poetry.  Nick Rhodes (then
 Bates) and Nigel John Taylor interviewed him and they knew that he had
 the right attitude and "look", it was probably those now infamous pink
 leopard print pants. After the band got all of its memebers (Simon being
 the last to join) they started writing their first album. Since this is a
 mini bio, we will say the rest is Duran History. Since 1981 the band has
 won the devotion of many as thee most important band of the 1980's and
 beyond. A large part of that can be accredited to Simon's writing, a true
 poetic demi-god if there ever was one. Throughout the 80's, Simon's
 lyrics moved at least one generation. 

 In addition to being a popstar, Simon did find time for a social life.
 Simon views himself as a Romantic, both in writing and in his personal
 life. Always outspoken on matters of the heart, Simon broke many when he
 got married to Yasmin Parvenah in 1986. A couple of years later the
 couple was blessed with Amber Rose. Simon has had two more children,
 Saffron Sahara (1992) and Tallulah Pine (1994) making him the most
 prolific daddy of the group. 

 Aside from a busy family life Simon enjoys a great number of sports,
 Yachting, Motorcycle racing, Fencing and Horseback riding just to name a
 few. His favorite football (soccer) team is Manchester United. Simon
 lives to be thrilled, he's in the right profession.

 =======================

  FROM: The Duran Temple
  AT: http://carroll1.cc.edu/~kwalker/duranduran.html


 One of the founding members of Duran Duran, John has distinguished
 himself as an exciting and prolific bass player. As a matter of fact he
 was one of the 5 Masters of British Rock in Bass Player Magazine 1995.
 Born Nigel John Taylor he, met Nick Bates at a swap meet in 1970. They
 traded pictures of Glam rocker, Gary Glitter.  While, Nigel attended art
 school his best friend, Nick, worked as a DJ at the Rum Runner nightclub.
 John started off playing lead guitar but switched to bass in 1979 after
 hearing "Good Times" by Chic, with legendary bassist Bernard Edwards (who
 later produced the Power Station and gave John the bass that he played on
 Good Times). Dynamic, energetic and good looking John would have, and
 still does succeed at everything he does. There is nothing John can't do
 or have, it would appear he's blessed with a golden touch. 
 
 In addition to his work in Duran, John has had great success with the
 group the Power Station (they even had quite a successful tour, both
 critically and with the fans) in 1985. He had a solo hit in 1986 that
 went to #24 on the charts, "I Do What I Do" co-written with Michael
 Desbarres and Jonathan Elias. He helped put together the reunion tour of
 the Faces in 1986-87. Currently he has started his own record label, B5
 records, has recorded a solo album, "Feelings Are Good and Other Lies".
 He was also co-founder of a concept supergroup the Neurotic Outsiders
 (with Steve Jones from the Sex Pistols, and Matt Sorum and Duff McKegan
 from Guns 'n' Roses). The NO had been signed to Madonna's record label,
 Maverick Records and produced a 12 track album which was given a select
 release   Due to other commitments and general lack of interest, NO
 have broken up - leaving John to concentrate on his solo career.

 Currently JT resides in the LA area and has released a number of singles
 including the rare Autodidact. He is separated from his wife, budding
 actress Amanda DeCadenet. They have a daughter, Atlanta (Noo) Taylor
 who will be 5 on March 21st 1998.

 Biography - Roger Taylor                       @{"<See Picture of Roger>" system "extras/ppshow pics/roger.iff"}
 ========================

  FROM: The Duran Temple
  AT: http://carroll1.cc.edu/~kwalker/duranduran.html


 Roger Taylor came to the band in 1978 with then friend Andy Wickett from
 a band called the Scent Organs. While Andy Wickett did not last Roger
 stayed with the band. Roger also brought with him the music to Girls on
 Film and Rio. These are just two examples of the Pure Drumming Genius and
 Raw Power that Roger is known for. He always adds that perfect touch
 that only he can, including some reunion drumming on Thank You and the
 song Perfect Day (be sure to look for him in the video and in any footage
 of that song, he was on Top of the Pops with Duran). 

 Roger was always the rock of Duran, keeping everyone firmly grounded in
 reality, the backbone of the band and of the music. In 1986 just after he
 finished up the Arcadia album, he decided the pressures of fame were too
 much for him and he retired from the music business to the country with
 his wife. 

 In addition to the band, Roger liked yachting and playing Tennis. In 1984
 Roger married long time girlfriend Giovanna Cantone in Naples. They have
 at least two children, boys. Unfortunately when Roger left the band
 information got sketchy. 

 However, today, Roger now splits his time between London and Gloucester
 (where he and his family have a farm). He is now back in the business
 part time working as a sessions drummer. He has worked with Duran on
 Thank You and on various solo material (which will not be released).

 Biography - Andy Taylor                        @{"<See Picture of Andy>" system "extras/ppshow pics/andy.iff"}
 =======================

  FROM: The Duran Temple
  AT: http://carroll1.cc.edu/~kwalker/duranduran.html


 Andy Taylor - not any band member before or since has had so much
 controversy about him. Needless to say, however, that Duran Duran would
 not be where they are today had he not been there in the beginning. It is
 his guitar riffs that led us to our great love of the band and it is his
 work and dedication in the beginning that led to Duran Duran's and Power
 Station's success. 

 Andy answered an ad for a "live-wired" guitarist in Melody Maker
 magazine. It was a perfect fit, he had the talent and experience that the
 young band needed. He started playing guitar professionally when he was
 14 and he hasn't stopped since. Andy married the band's former
 hairstylist, Tracy Wilson, in 1982, John helped pay for the wedding and
 was best man at the ceremony. They now have at least three children and
 reside in London. 

 In addition to his work with Duran, Andy has worked on Power Station I
 and II.  He has also had a solo album and has worked as a sessions
 guitarist, having worked for Belinda Carlisle and Rod Stewart just to
 name a few.  As a matter of fact he has helped co-write much of
 the last 2 albums of Rod Stewart. Currently he has working on a tribute
 album for the group the Small Faces and the Powerstation II album 'Living
 In Fear'.

 Biography - Warren Cuccurullo                  @{"<See Picture of Warren>" system "extras/ppshow pics/warren.iff"}
 =============================

  FROM: The Duran Temple
  AT: http://carroll1.cc.edu/~kwalker/duranduran.html



 Warren has the unique honor of being famous in more than one band!  He
 has worked with many talented people including the fabulously innovative
 Frank Zappa. Warren is also famous from his days with Missing Persons,
 and is also unique because he is the only American in the band, bringing
 to the band rhythms that helped originate the genre known as
 Rock & Roll. 

 Warren joined the band in 1986 right after Andy Taylor officially decided
 to call it quits. Coincidently Warren found out about the job opening
 just as Missing Persons was breaking up. Since then Warren has added a
 terrific blend of American Grit and Spanish Guitar Stylings (as
 Spanish/Brazilian guitarists have influenced him as a musician) to our
 favorite band. Warren has been the key ingredient to the bands style and
 rhythms as their musical arranger as well. He has also guested as a
 bassist and drummer on the last couple of Duran albums. Proving that his
 talents go much farther than just playing the guitar. 

 In the last few years, warren has released a number of solo projects
 including a tribute to his mentor Frank Zappa called "Thanks To Frank",
 and his own guitar opera entitled 'Machine Language'. In addition to his
 solo album Warren is working on a Rock Opera called "TV Mania: Bored with
 Prozac and the Internet" with Nick.

@node "A.Starting your collection" ""
@next "MAIN"
@prev "MAIN"
 Starting Your Own Collection
 ============================


 People Like You..
 ------------------
  People who enjoy music are usually split into three main categories,
 the casual listeners, the fans and the collectors.  A casual listener
 will like many kinds of music and will have a number of releases from
 many groups.  A fan will also have a large variety of tastes but will
 also have quite a few releases from one group in particular, usually
 most of the groups albums. Finally, a collector will have a
 concentrated taste in music and will devote a lot of shopping time
 looking for any releases by a favourite group or style.  Such
 collectors scour various places for anything they may not have, in any
 recording medium, and even buying item they already have if the quality
 of the item is good enough. Collectors also buy anything related to
 their idols such as videos, postcards, tour programs, badges, books and
 other memorabilia. If you are a fan of a particular group, do you like
 them enough to become a collector?  Collecting may mean spending quite
 an amount of time and money on your subject.  It may mean you have to
 advertise and go out of your way to get those elusive singles - are you
 up to the job?  If you think you can give it a go, then read on...



 Who's The Lucky One..?
 ---------------------- 
  Sometimes the hardest part of collecting is choosing which group(s) to
 collect.  If you like a number of artists, or many different styles, it
 may seem easier to collect in general rather than particular.  For
 example, your interest may be New Wave (Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet,
 ABC, Heaven 17 etc.) do you collect all these bands?  Do you collect
 New Wave in general or just one of them?  Your choice may depend on the
 money you have to spend or what's available in the shops.

  The thing to remember is that if you collect for a relatively unknown
 group like ABC, who may have only had one or two hit singles, then
 there's going to be less material available to buy, and rarities may be
 even harder to find.  If you collect for well known artists like The
 Beatles or Elvis, there will be a lot more material available, maybe at
 a lower price because of their mass production, but rare items will be
 vastly more expensive and maybe hard to find.  For example, a copy of
 'Blue Suede Shoes' in the best condition may cost a collector between
 £150 - £200.

   If your interest lies with a new modern group, which have fewer
 releases to choose from and so easier to collect, then this too can be
 worth your while.  Releases will be easier to get and can be ordered
 directly from shops.  They will also be relatively cheap, especially if
 the group is unknown and with few successes in the charts.  If the
 group then becomes famous, the value of the items you have will rise
 sharply. If the group fails to become successful, the value of your
 items will fall, so be careful.

  The best collections are mainly for well known artists who have had a
 number of hits, who've been together for at least 10 years and who've
 released a number of albums/singles on vinyl.  Such artists may
 include: Madonna, Michael Jackson, Cher, Sting, Tina Turner, Diana
 Ross, David Bowie, George Michael, Bon Jovi.  Groups relative to an
 era: The Beatles, The Monkees, The Rolling Stones, Elvis, Queen.  80's
 groups which still have influence today: The Police, Duran Duran,
 Blondie, The Jam, U2. Even 90's groups may be worth collecting for the
 future: The Lightning Seeds, Dubstar, even the Spice Girls, the longer
 a group stays together and the more famous they are, the more valuable
 their products will become.



 What & Why
 ----------
  If you are serious about your chosen group, you will probably have all
 their albums already on one format or another.  The most pleasure
 though can be gained if you go the whole hog and collecting everything
 in  sight, on all formats including 7", 12", EP, LP, CD and Tape, then
 going  out of your way to collect the memorabilia as well.  At the end
 of the  day you should end up with every song the group has ever
 released, every  one-off, every b-side,every promo, so you have the
 definitive  collection.  Then you'll find collectors beating down YOUR
 door for a  change, offering you money for that elusive item.  Your
 esteem among  collectors will go up and you may make a small profit as
 well.

  But lets not too far ahead of ourselves here.  You can gain just as
 much personal pleasure from a small collection as a large one.  The
 more  you spend on your collection, the happier you should be, and
 anything  else you gain from the exercise is a bonus.   The point
 being  that collecting should be fun, and the moment it becomes a boar,
 you  can always sell it and start again with something else.

  You must always consider that at some point you will want to get rid
 of some of the items you have collected.  With this in mind, you must
 consider what is worth collecting so other people will consider buying
 them from you.  For example, if you have a collection of UK singles and
 somebody else has a collection of imported ones, which is the most
 valuable?  It can be worth leaving cheap items from your own country
 and investing in imports instead.


 Which Format?
 -------------
  The value of the medium your songs are recorded on has a direct effect
 on what the item is worth, and even its playing quality.  The main
 contenders are:-

   CD - Compact discs are good for easy playing and easy selection of
        tracks.  They are hard wearing and will keep better than tapes
        or vinyl. Unfortunately, the price of a CD is usually high
        compared to tapes and albums usually have a fixed price range
        of £12 - £17. This may prove too expensive for a collector,
        especially if the purchase is not imported as the value will
        come down rather then go up over time.  The quality of a CD is
        also a contentious point. Some say vinyl is by far the best
        medium as it plays analogue and you can hear more 'sounds'.
        Some say CDs are better is they play digitally and so the sounds
        you can here may be clearer.  The fact is that most CDs have
        been recorded from their vinyl counterparts and so vinyl is
        closer to the original recording than CD is. Finally, CDs have
        become very common over the last 10 years and so their value has
        come down.  Early CDs are better value as they were very
        expensive at when they were released.

 Tape - Cassettes are better for collectors than most CDs.  They are
        worth more because of their fragility and rareness.  When most
        cassettes were released, the most common medium was either vinyl
        or CD and so there are fewer cassettes to buy now.  They are
        also quite cheap, £2 - £4 for a tape in good condition, which
        may be worth £5 or more in the future.  The worst feature about
        tapes is their fragility, it is so easy to wipe a part of the
        tape as you play it, rendering the whole product worthless.
        Magnets and liquids can also cause major damage and a chewed
        tape is a useless tape.

 Vinyl - Vinyl on the other hand is by far the best all round product.
        It has been around for a long, long time and so the older the
        vinyl, the more it is generally worth more (depending on the
        subject). There are a huge number of vinyl recording on the
        market but very few in good condition.  These are the items
        serious collectors want as they are the hardest to find.  The
        biggest point about vinyl is that the recording is nearly always
        from the masterdisc.  This means the quality of the recording is
        good and is by far the closest to the original sound. Vinyl
        doesn't damage from liquids and can be repaired easier then CDs.
        The worst point is their tendency to scratch.  A stylus needle
        will make tiny scratches on the surface every time you play the
        record and these build up over time to lessen playing quality.
        Huge scratches can knock quite a lot off the value of the item
        so the most care must be taken with them. 



 So Where Do I Start?
 ---------------------
  Now you have decided who you are going to collect for and what your
 hoping to get, the next step is actually going out and getting some
 material.  To make sure you get your collection off to a good start,
 make sure you save a little money, say £50, and dedicate this solely to
 your cause.  This is so you can buy all the immediate items you see in
 the shops, as they may have been sold the week after.  Also, shop
 owners and traders will notice if you spend an amount of money on a
 particular artist and are more likely to stock more of the same for the
 next time you come in.  Once you have your starting capitol, its time
 to hit the shops, but where are the best places to look?  There are
 many outlets where you can buy the items you are looking for, all with
 advantages and disadvantages:


  Main Music Dealer - These outlets will get all their music direct from
 the manufacturer.  They will order any item currently available and
 offer a massive range of material within the shop/building.  The
 downside is that these shops will tend to charge the recommended retail
 prices for their items, for example, a tape may cost £10 and CDs £15.
 Because the items you buy are brand new originals, you are guaranteed
 quality and any defective purchase will be quickly replaced.  Imports
 are usually restricted to US imports and an additional shipping charge
 will be added to the product. Dealers will also sell a range of videos
 and may have a vinyl section as well though these will tend to be
 modern releases from the past few years. There will also be mass
 reduction schemes within each shop  (buy three, get one free etc).
 This will save you even more money but will still be more expensive
 than other sources.
    ITEM QUALITY: Mint         UK EXAMPLES: Virgin Megastores, HMV


  Local Music Shop - These are smaller versions on the main stores and
 may have the same name and products.  These stores get their stock from
 the main branch and all the same advantages and disadvantages apply to
 the customer.  Prices are much the same, though there may be less
 chance of a mass reduction scheme as less items are ordered per shop, a
 discount bin may be used to promote this instead.  Music shops are less
 likely to stock imports either, and chart hits will have to be ordered
 if not on display. Vinyls sections will be rare and choice will be
 more limiting.  It may be possible to play your items before you buy if
 you ask nicely, but assistant knowledge of items in stock may be
 lacking unless a computer system is in operation.  Item quality is
 always guaranteed and returns will be dealt with quickly.  
    ITEM QUALITY: Mint         UK EXAMPLES: Andys Records, Our Price


  Mail Order Companies - If a shop cannot afford to own a high street
 building, the owners may prefer to run the whole thing from their own
 home.  This is what most mail order companies are, private music
 enthusiasts, who will advertise in a number of places to get
 recognition. These shops, depending on their type, may either stock
 only good quality goods, or may stock anything no-matter what
 condition.  It is important to look closely at their adverts to see if
 goods are rated by quality, and if so, make sure the quality you want
 is listed.  Mail order shops are generally cheaper than their high
 street counterparts (excluding postage charges) and will have a massive
 catalogue to choose from.  All formats are also usually supported,
 including vinyl, videos and other such memorabilia. Imports may also
 be available, though prices will be greatly increased for the ones in
 best condition.  The shop may be on the internet, discounts may be
 available but credit will not be.
    ITEM QUALITY: Variable     UK EXAMPLES: Vinyl Tap, CJ's Music


  Local Retail Shop / Chain Store - Such stores usually sell music as a
 sideline to their other material, which may include books, magazines,
 games, stationary and confectionery etc.  These shops will buy direct
 from a local distributor or warehouse, but only the leading items - the
 ones they thing will sell.  These can be limited to the current charts
 hits and a collection of 'classic' albums, though the chart hits may be
 a little cheaper than some sources.  Prices tend to be RRP but quality
 is guaranteed.  These shops will not sell vinyl (or tapes sometimes),
 will not offer credit but can offer discounts on old material. Some
 stores will also offer discount cards so buying many items will save
 you money in the future.  
    ITEM QUALITY: Mint / Near    UK EXAMPLES: WH Smiths, Woolworths 


  Small Music Shop - The small, dedicated, music shop offers a much more
 specialized range of items than a chain store, at better prices than a
 mainstream music shops and a better one-to-one service.  Product range
 usually includes all recent chart entries as well as an amount of
 vinyls, and recent releases from the more popular artists.  Items can
 be ordered from a large back catalogue, unless the product has been
 deleted, or is unavailable from the main supplier.  The shop owner or
 assistants should be able to point you in the direction of available
 items on request and can answer questions directly.  The music shop
 will also have a selection of imports and/or rarities although the size
 of this collection may be small compared to mail order shops.  Prices
 are average but not too cheap but items bought may not be replaceable
 and so a refund may be all you get for defective goods.   The vinyl
 section may either be half the shop or a small collection in a box,
 depending on the owners preference, so ask if you can't see any
 straight away.
    ITEM QUALITY: Mint / Near Mint      


  Large Market Trader - If a market trader gets too big for a market
 site, it may be necessary to move into a small shop or a unit inside an
 indoor market.  These are much like the small music shops above, but
 instead of buying most of their stock from dealers, they will tend to
 buy from customers - although only the best quality items.  This means
 the shop will tend to have older items in stock, and may have a number
 of rarities handed in by customers.  Imports are less common but some
 may be available if a major collector has recently brought in some old
 items.  Quality is reasonable but always make sure it meets your needs
 before you buy.  An advantage with this type of shop is that playing
 facilities may be available so you can check quality before purchasing.
 Prices may also vary but will usually be quite cheap compared to
 sources above, maybe offering additional discounts on special items and
 to regular customers, with customer accounts also available.  Again,
 the shop owner / assistant should be able to help you find items and
 answer questions about stock, though they will not be able to buy new
 items for you, instead having to wait for more new items to come in
 from customers or other traders.   Other memorabilia may be available.
    ITEM QUALITY: Near Mint - Good


  Small Market Trader - On certain days of the week, a town or city may
 have an outdoor market.  This is a collection of tables/stalls run by
 licensed market traders, each offering its own set of items.  Among
 these, there are usually one or two stalls which sell musical items,
 though maybe in small amounts.  Traders usually buy from other traders
 and customers as well as selling their personal items.  The items for
 sale may be second hand or damaged so care must be taken when buying.
 Check for physical defects on the items, including marks and
 scratches. It the item is a tape, make sure it winds properly and the
 tape is not scored or chewed.  Playing facilities are rare and
 defective goods may not be replaceable, resulting in cash refunds or a
 swap.  On the other hand, items are usually sold very cheaply, for
 example 50p for a single and £2.00 for an album, so bargains are well
 worth hunting out.  A quick word to the owner will usually tell you if
 it is worth a rummage, especially if you can't find related items
 straight away.
    ITEM QUALITY: Good - Substandard


  Car Boot / Unlicensed Traders - On some days of the week, a towns
 market place may be given over to unlicensed traders or Car Boot
 dealers.  Many items on sale are old and damaged and it may take a
 while to find anything of interest.  The unlicensed trader is not bound
 by contract or law and so quality will inevitably be compromised,
 although prices should be really cheap.  A benefit of such one-to-one
 trading is that prices can be 'haggled' down to a agreeable price
 before you buy them.  Again, make sure the quality is acceptable before
 you leave the site as dealers may not be there when you come back.
 Playing facilities may still be in existence and memorabilia such as
 videos and promotions collected by the owner may be found.  The owner
 will be less likely to buy items from other people, preferring to sell
 the ones already in stock.  Because the stall may be quite small, the
 dealers should know all the items available so a quick word to them can
 save 10 minutes record hunting.
    ITEM QUALITY: Variable


  Magazine Small Ads - Private ads and offers in magazines and
 newspapers may also sell items you may want.  You are almost guaranteed
 quality because nobody is going to spend time and money on a duff item.
 If you are interested in the products on offer, quickly ring the
 advertiser and ask any questions about the product to make sure it's
 what you want.  If the seller is within your area, it may be best to
 reserve the item so you can view the item(s) personally.  Take the
 usual precautions with cheques and follow up any late deliveries if you
 can't pick the items up yourself. Haggling the price is always worth a
 try and a good play before you buy will settle any quality doubts you
 may have.  If the seller has many more items you may want in stock, you
 may have found an outlet for the future, and a fellow collector. 
    ITEM QUALITY: Mint - Good      UK EXAMPLES: Observer, Loot, Locals


  Friends / Relations - The best outlet for new material and things you
 want are friends with the same taste as yourself.  The items on offer
 can be bought very cheaply, sometimes for little more than a favour or
 two. You can usually borrow the items first to make sure you want them
 and the make sure the quality is good enough.  Friends may also be able
 to get even more items for you from their other friends, and can be a
 great source of gig memorabilia if they regularly support the group.
    ITEM QUALITY: Variable


 Things To Note
 --------------
  Once you have found a good outlet for you artist, with matches both
 your standards and your pocket, make sure you keep going in and asking
 for any new items.  Local music shops and traders should be very
 helpful and will get items they know you want, or ones you don't have.

  It's always good policy to check all the items you wish to buy before
 you pay for them or leave the shop.  Make sure there are no physical
 defects or marks on the items which may degrade playing quality, and
 make sure tapes wind correctly and are not chewed inside.  In some
 shops, it is possible to play items before you buy, so don't be afraid
 to do this if in doubt, remember that playing is a crucial part of
 buying a recorded product.

  Always buy vinyl if you can, especially good 7" with different b-sides
 as these are great for collection building.  EP's, Flexi's, 10" and
 Picture discs can be worth even more because of their rarity, although
 12" LP's are usually common and so not worth as much.  Watch out for
 coloured vinyl or vinyl with pictures on them (picture discs) as these
 can be worth more. Promotions, with are written as such on the cover,
 are worth more, as are extras like a different cover, an added song or
 bonus items like posters. Even interview recordings can be worth money
 to collectors.

  Also keep an eye out for imports, Australian and Japanese.  Rare
 imports are the most valuable, especially if words on the cover are not
 in English. Imports can be common in some shops and are only a few
 pounds more expensive than their UK counterparts.  In this situation it
 it 100% better to buy the imports as the UK releases can usually be
 bought in a great deal more places.  A collection full of imports will
 be worth much more, both in value, and to the owner.  Sometimes an
 artist may release special items for a particular country (and nowhere
 else).  Such items are worth finding but be prepared to spend money as
 these items are never cheap.  If you do have may common UK releases, it
 may be possible to trade with a pen friend in another country, where
 your items will be considered imports and the friend can send you cheap
 items from his/her own country.  

  Don't be put off if you see an item you already have.  Check if the
 new item is less marked or scratched, or with a better sleeve than your
 old one.  If you have a perfect disc/tape at home but the cover is
 below standard, weigh up the cost of this new item and consider
 swapping the new cover for your old one, boosting the values of the old
 item.  In small shops, the price of 7" singles or CD singles may be £1
 - £3, so it's well worth buying a new copy.

  Once you have a small collection, keep track of all your stock on
 paper or on file.  Many market traders will ask for a list of what you
 have so they can swap or buy from you.  This may be worth considering,
 especially if you have more than one copy of a number of items.  It may
 be possible to swap these unneeded copies for something you don't have.

  It is also important to set little goals for yourself while
 collecting. For example, why not collect all your groups albums on
 tape or vinyl.  What about collecting all their 7" B-sides.  There may
 be a promo you need to save up for, do you sell your old stock to buy
 new? All these considerations have to be made and it makes collecting
 such a worthwhile thing to do.



 Look Now, Look All Around..
 ---------------------------
  Now you have chosen your group and considered what items you should be
 going for, and where to get them, you are ready to collect.  You don't
 need to carry vast amounts of money with you to buy items, but it is
 better to buy more items together rather than less items separately.
 If your dealer supports SWITCH or other debit cards, it may be better
 to use these and lessen the chances of theft or loss of money, but be
 careful not to overspend!  

  Once your collection is building nicely, what should you consider? Why
 not save a little money and travel to another town or city where there
 are more outlets available.  The chances are the shops in a different
 location will carry some items not available near you.

  If your on the Internet, check out a few search engines and find
 related web sites.  Such sites will contain all the latest information
 about your group as well as classified ads and offers which may be just
 what your looking for.  Pelpals can be found in this way and rarities
 can be tracked down through E-mail enquiries.  Some sites will also
 contain discographies of your group.  These will show every release the
 artist has ever released, in every format and in every country, so you
 can easily see what's on offer out there.

  A little closer to home, why not pick up the Yellow Pages and look
 under record shops or dealers.  You'll be surprised how many people
 advertise in here, from private homes to mail order companies, to main
 dealers.  Some of the smaller ads can be the best and once you have an
 outlet for your material, you need never use anywhere else.  

  If possible, keep away from the main dealers and music shops as they
 will only tend to sell new material, at inflated prices.  Albums will
 rarely be the originals if they are over 5 or 6 years old, usually
 being cheap re-releases which are worth very little.

  If you are a major collector, you can always advertise yourself and
 what you collect.  Local papers can offer free advertisement space for
 items under £100 if you want to buy or sell items in this way.  Many
 private owners will ring you, and some may have things you need.  A
 number of collectors may also contact you, who are by far the best
 sources of new material.  

  I always recommend people buy vinyl rather than any other material
 because of its ago and value.  Don't worry if you don't have anything
 to play them on as a Separates System can be bought very cheaply.  This
 is a method of buying the parts of a Music Centre / Multi System
 without buying the whole thing.  All you need is the Amplifier, and
 Turntable and some speakers, the tuner, cassette deck and CD player can
 be added later if you need them. Many small music shops and large
 market traders will sell these items cheaply, but make sure the
 combination you have chosen all works before you leave the shop.  Also
 make sure you go for the leading brands of turntables.  An old type
 needle can damage old records and can distort playing, on the other
 hand an ultra fine modern needle may pick up all the 'crackle' on the
 record as they are so sensitive.

  If you buy modern releases from a group, especially a single, the item
 may contain a postcard which you can send back to the publisher to get
 the latest information from them.  These are well worth sending off as
 you will get to know of events and releases from the artist before they
 happen. Most postcards are Freepost so why not send them off. 

   Finally, if you become desperate for a particular release, why not
 write directly to the publisher or distributor.  They should have the
 complete back catalogue of items from the group or should be able to
 get them for you.  Once you have an address to write to, quote the name
 of the product, the artist and the catalogue number if you know it so
 they can check.  In return you may get a price list or another address
 to write to. But never give up hope. 


  But remember, a collection should be for pleasure, so enjoy it.

 Taking Care Of Your Collection
 ==============================

 Storing
 -------
  The first thing to remember when you buy any musical media is how to
 store them.  Most types of media, especially vinyls, suffer if you
 store them incorrectly.  Anything from dust damage to scratches can
 seriously affect the playing quality of the items, which in turn will
 affect personal and financial value.  The very last thing you should do
 is to leave your recordings in a box up in the attic.  Any damp in the
 air will rot your covers and will also degrade you vinyl, leaving them
 worthless on retrieval.

    CDs - It is important to keep CDs inside a suitable case,
 preferably, their original one, so the chance of damage becomes
 minimal.  Make sure the case is intact, without any severe cracks or
 holes on its surface.  Also make sure the grippers inside the case
 (which hold the CD in place) are adequate enough to do their job. This
 is the most important feature as a CD rattling around inside its case
 will incur more damage than a CD left flat on a shelf.  Never remove
 the inlay or the underside information from the case unless you really
 need to as this case damage both the case and the inlay.  This is also
 the easiest way to loose or damage the inlay, though bending or from
 soilment.  If you have to remove and insert an inlay, gently slide it
 out of the side, making sure it doesn't get caught up on any protruding
 plastic which hold them in place.  To insert, make a note of the
 plastic hooks on the upper and lower edges of the case.  Insert the
 inlay into the bottom set of hooks and gently bend under the top set of
 hooks.  Never reinsert by sliding it back in.  It can also be wise to
 leave your favourite CD in your CD players tray or multichange
 cartridge, this will save you getting it out and exposing the CD to
 dust every time you want to use it.  A CD rack is a good idea for easy
 access to you collection.  Some are better than others but be aware
 than some may have additional plastic grips which may damage soft
 cardboard and digipak cases.  Finally, make sure you wrap the case in
 any covers or wrappers if it came with any as this will save accidental
 scratches.

  Tapes - Most of the information above can be related to cassettes as
 well.  Removal of inlay cards can cause accidental damage so the safest
 place for them is in their own box. Constant removal and insertion of
 the cassette against the cover can also result in wear, which should be
 avoided. Cassettes should never be crammed into a tight space, like an
 over crowded cassette storage box as this can cause cracking to the
 case and make removal that much harder.  As far as the tape is
 concerned, the best policy would be to never use it at all (see `Best
 Policy` below). Always use cassettes in the best quality playback units
 to reduce the possibility of jams and erasures.  Never use them in
 cheap car radios as these can be prone to chewing and degrading
 quality.
 
  Vinyl - As with CDs and tapes, it is paramount that you keep them in
 their original sleeve to reduce the possibility of damage.  Removal and
 insertion of the record can also inflict damage to the sleeve, such as
 cracks and tears.  Always use a sub-sleeve if you have one (the sleeve
 the vinyl goes in, which slots inside the main sleeve).  This will
 slightly reduce the chances of damage to the sides and bottom of the
 sleeve as you insert the record.  Be aware though that inserting these
 sub-sleeves is a harder job than just inserting the record, so it is
 far better if you leave these inside when removing the vinyl. Special
 clear plastic covers are also available in both 7" and 12" forms which
 the whole sleeve fits into.  This will guard against any sort of damage
 which may occur, even spillage, so it is better to leave the cover
 inside the sleeve at all times and remove the vinyl from the opening at
 the top.  Paper bags provide a good alternative to these but do not be
 tempted to use thin `tissue` plastic bags as these produce static
 electricity which can affect the vinyl.  Finally make sure you keep
 your items stored safely, either in a carrier bag or other plastic
 container. Boxes will soon become damp and mildew will begin to appear
 on the surface of your records.




 Best Policy
 -----------
  So what`s the best way to protect all your recordings against damage?
 Simple, just don`t use them at all!   The best thing about the modern
 cassette tape is that you can easily record material to them without
 serious quality loss.  If you listen to your original tapes or vinyls a
 lot, it may be better to record them on tape and use these copies
 instead.  Remember, every time you play vinyl, small scratches from the
 stylus needed will appear and every time you play a tape, you increase
 the chances of the erase head accidentally removing a chunk of music
 instead of playing it (its happened to me). Do you really want to go
 though that misery?  You can always create a compilation of your
 favourite songs on tape from many sources, and play this instead. 



 Inserting and Removing Your Vinyl
 ---------------------------------
  Unlike CDs, where you can simply insert the CD onto the grippers and
 close the case, a vinyl recording and its cover require much more care.
 Have you ever picked up a 7" and noticed the vinyl poking out of the
 bottom or the side, though a hole it has made though bad insertion.
 Through time, these cracks will become much bigger as the record rubs
 though them, finally destroying one side of the sleeve.  One of the
 best lessons therefore is how to insert a record properly, and so to
 minimise damage.

  NEVER hold the sleeve vertically and drop the record in, even with
 singles.  It will band against the bottom of the sleeve and will start
 to break though.

  The best way is to hold the sleeve flat (horizontally), with your hand
 firmly gripping it at one end, and with the opening at the opposite
 end. To remove a record, tilt your hand so the sleeve points downwards
 at a gentle angle, this will help the record slide of though gravity
 rather than pulling.  At the same time, reach in with your other hand
 and help it slide out.  To insert, follow the same procedure - grip the
 sleeve firmly at one, making side the sleeve is held flat
 (horizontally).  Then gently insert the record with the other hand,
 making sure to avoid the folds inside the record (where the front cover
 is glued onto the back cover).  This should reduce the change of rub
 damage by 80%.



 Cleaning Your Vinyl
 --------------------

  There are many cleaners available which specialise in vinyl cleaning.
 These are cheap but can still be more expensive than some methods.
 Anything from Mr. Sheen to White Spirit can be used in the same way and
 will do a good job.  Whenever you buy additional items for your
 collection, the chances are that it will need cleaning, especially if
 it`s second hand.  Even brand new material could need a quick wipe to
 remove dust or finger prints, and make sure it is in it`s best playing
 condition for when you need it.

  White spirit or Turpentine is great for removing the top layer of dirt
 from the grooves of vinyl. Soap based methods are less successful as
 the soup will dry in the grooves and makes playing even worse.  Cold
 Water and cotton wool is by far the cheapest method and is far better
 then just leaving it alone.  Whenever you expose the record to any kind
 of cleaning agent, must MUST protect the label from any contact with
 it.  You can easily damage the label in this way and this damage is
 almost always permanent.  One way to protect the label would be to use
 a circle of plastic to protect it.  This could be from a thick plastic
 bag, and cut just bigger than the area you wish to cover.  Wash and dry
 the plastic to make sure it`s as clean as possible before using it.
 Then place it over the label of your record and seal it around the
 edges with tape, making sure none of the tape touches either the label
 or the grooves. Electrical tape will do this job well as it doesn't
 leave any residue behind.  The label is now waterproof and a good
 thorough cleaning can now take place.  Remember to remove any tape
 residue from the vinyl before to store it as some cheap tapes can leave
 some behind.  

  For best cleaning results, follow the steps below:

  1.  Stick one of the label covers (described above) to each side of
      the record you wish to clean. 
  2.  Apply your cleaner either by spraying on (for spray cleaners) or
      directly to a piece of cotton wool (for liquid cleaners such as
      white spirit). The more you apply to the record, the better but
      the longer it will take to clean and dry.
  3.  Rub to record with cotton wool in a circular motion, following the
      grooves of the record, from the outside edge to the inside.  If
      you see any excess dirt or material on the surface of the vinyl,
      increase the pressure a little and rub off the material using
      short stocks, still following the grooves of the record. Do not
      rub too hard as this can heat up the record and cause heat damage.
      Never try to scratch a material off as this will cause even more
      damage.
  4.  Clean the record from the outside edge to the inside, going over
      any heavily soiled parts again with a different piece of cotton
      wool. (The same piece with just rub dirt back in).
  5.  Remember to hold the record by the edges as much as you can to
      prevent finger marks.  These don`t really degrade playing quality
      but can attract further dust to them over time, and are a pain to
      with a cloth.
  6.  When both sides are complete, leave the record to dry in a safe,
      dry place.  If possible, make sure none of the wet vinyl is
      touching anything.  Never leave the record flat on a surface as
      the surface can contain more dirt.  If you must lie the record
      flat, place something under the label to raise it up off surface
      level.  Don`t be tempted to peg your records out on the washing
      line, not only will they fall off and break but the outside air
      will be far dirtier than the inside air and the record will have
      to be cleaned again.  
  7.  When completely dry, take a dry piece of cotton wool, velvet cloth
      or similar and wipe the whole record from the outside inwards,
      just like when cleaning it.  This will remove fibres left on the
      surface and will make sure the tracks in the record are dry enough
      to play.  You can increase the shine on the record at this stage
      simply by repeated wiping or rubbing.  Applied polish may or may
      not be a good idea as this too may clog up the grooves, so don`t
      use too much.
  8.  If you want to remove the label covers, this is the best time, but
      be careful not to finger print the vinyl again.  You could always
      leave the covers on to protect the label.
  9.  Take the clean record over to your turntable and play it though at
      top speed.  Don`t worry about `jumps` at this stage as these can
      be corrected later.  Playing will remove the disturbed dirt from
      the grooves, as well as cleaning up the surface of excess fibres.
      It may be necessary to clean the needle after each side has played
      to remove material with may have built up.  
 10.  If you hear excess crackle, there may be a little more dirt to
      remove, so repeat the process but concentrate your efforts in this
      area.  If you see any major damage, you may be able to repair it
      using the method below.
 11.  If you play the record though and it sounds fine, it may be an
      idea to take a recording from it now (see 'best policy' above).
      This is better than re-using it as more scratches will appear as
      you play it.
 12.  Insert the record back inside its protective cover, making sure
      the inside of the cover is free from dirt or other material.
      Never clean your covers with any liquids or you will ruin them.



 Repairing Jumps
 ---------------
  Even after you've thoroughly cleaned a vinyl record, the track may
 still 'jump' when playing.  When this happens, hold the record up to a
 light and see if you can spot any obvious defects which may have caused
 this.  If you can, see 'Repairing You Vinyl' below.  If you cannot, the
 cause is most likely dirt build up on one particular groove and this is
 easily fixed.  You can either reapply your cleaning liquid and rub out
 the dirt, which in most cases will fail to remove the defect, or you
 can do the following.  But remember, using the stylus in this way may
 cause damage to cheep needles - in which case you may be better trying
 the 'Repair Your Vinyl' method instead.

  1.  Place your record on the turntable and start to play just before
      the jump occurs.
  2.  A few seconds before the jump, hold down the stylus head with your
      finger, so the needle is pushed down into the groove.  Don't worry
      what the track plays like when doing this, most systems will loose
      playing quality as the needle becomes unbalanced. If you have an
      older system or a big needle, don't press down too firmly as this
      may cause stress on the needle. 
  3.  If all goes well, the track will play though the jump and you may
      feel a little movement of the head as it passes over dirt.
  4.  If this works, which it will 85% of the time, play the track again
      from before the jump and see if it now plays without jumping. If
      not, repeat from step 1.
  5.  You may have to repeat this many times if the record is
      particularly old or dirty, so it is best to clean in thoroughly
      before you begin.
  6.  If you fail to fix a jump after several retries, there will be a
      physical defect like a crack or scratch which cannot be corrected
      in this way.



 Repairing Your Vinyl
 ---------------------
   If you find you have physical marks, scratches, broken tracks or
 'crackling' it may be possible to repair them.  Scratches are a big
 problem for LP's because the songs on an LP are compressed into such a
 small area.  Singles generally play even if then become full of
 scratches, though they will tend to crackle a lot more when this
 happens. The wider the grooves, the more damage the record will take
 before quality is severally compromised.  7" singles and LP's suffer
 greatly from this sort of thing but 12" singles are better as the
 grooves are very much bigger and further apart. Also, the older the
 recording, the further apart the grooves will be so a scratched 50 year
 old recording will play better than a scratched 5 year old recording
 will.

  Repairing vinyl can be a very hit-or-miss affair but there is
 certainly no harm in trying.  One of the best substances for the job is
 a liquid oil such as WB40, or even White spirit.  As you rub the vinyl,
 the grooves will slightly melt and seal up any cracks which may have
 built up along them.  You must also remember to use the correct rubbing
 material as a poor choice could cause more damage.  The best material
 by far is felt so obtaining a felt cloth may be your first step.  To
 instigate a repair, follow the steps below:

  1.  Cover and clean your record as described in an earlier section
      above.  
  2.  Spray a little of your chosen fixing agent on a piece of felt
      making sure you control the spray away from anything which may be
      damaged by it, like record covers.
  3.  Wipe over the defect and apply a little more pressure than you did
      when cleaning.  Rub around the area both across and down the
      defect, but making sure you don't press on very hard or the vinyl
      will heat up and cause damage.  If the felt dries out, apply more
      fixing agent.
  4.  After a time, you should see the defect fading, especially if it's
      a light scratch or mark.  Holes or deep scratches may not be
      removable.
  5.  If the defect is removable, make sure it is removed as well as it
      can be, or you may still get crackle when playing.
  6.  It may also be worth going over the whole record surface, from the
      outside inwards along the line of the grooves, to remove any minor
      errors which cannot be seen with the naked eye.
  7.  Once you are satisfied you have done all you can with the
      recording, leave it to dry for half an hour, wipe it dry and play
      it through again to see if the music sounds any better.  You may
      need to clean off any residue on the needle afterwards as spray
      oil can mix with the dirt of the grooves and create a waxy
      substance on the needle.
  8.  If the record still doesn't play any better, the defect will
      probably be permanent.  If may also be worth checking the balance
      of your stylus arm, the quality of the needle or upgrading to a
      modern system which can cope with defects better.



 Repairing Tapes
 ---------------
  A cassette tape can so easily be damaged though chewing, blanking,
 spillage of liquids or dust, and most are terminal, though there are
 some tricks which can be adopted.

  The most obvious one for a blankage on a tape is to go over it with a
 copy of the same song.  Obtain the song on single or from another album
 and simply re-record over the old song, making sure the songs are the
 exact same length to prevent erasure of the next song.  If you can
 afford to buy or borrow the exact same product again, then this is even
 better as you can record over the whole tape and so restore it fully.


  If the cassette makes a funny noise when playing, or fails to wind
 properly, the tape itself may be in error.  If the cassette is screwed
 together, try loosening the screws or removing a few to ease pressure.
 If the cassette itself is the cause, you may want to swap the tape
 inside to another cassette.  If tape is the problem, and if you can
 find a blank tape of the same length, you can also record the whole
 tape onto this blank one and then simply swap the 'insides' over. You
 can cut down a tape to size by playing both tapes together. When your
 original tape stops, stop your blank tape and open it up.  Cut the
 extra tape off and discard it and also cut off the plastic wheel from
 the unneeded tape with any clear tape which may come with it.  You can
 now stick your tape (which is now cut to the right length), to the
 clear tape (on the end of the plastic wheel) with a little super glue.
 Put the cassette back together, record both sides of the original tape
 onto it and swap the insides over.  You can use a similar method to
 extend the length of your blank tapes.

  The above also works if you have a chewed tape.  The original tape is
 useless so get rid of it.  Then find the release again (maybe on
 another format) and record it onto a tape of the same length, and put
 this into the shell of your original tape.



 Repairing CDs
 --------------
  A CD is by far the hardest to repair of all types of media, though
 some say they are less likely to go wrong than either Vinyl or Taped
 recordings.  CD Repair kits are available such as the CD Repair System
 from BundeeCD3.  This comprises of three liquids - a cleaner, a
 repairer and a protector which should be applied to the CD
 sequentially.  The effect of such repair kits can be minimal but will
 never make the damage any worse.  Because the surface of a CD is made
 of very soft acrylic, is is all too easy to mark the surface with your
 own cleaning cloths, even cotton wool can make tiny scratches on the
 surface.  Lint free cloths or ones even softer than cotton wool can be
 used and a number of household liquids can be used for repairs.

  If you have relatively light marks, furniture polish can be applied.
 This will also give the cover a high sheen which helps when playing.
 When applying anything to a CD, remember to wipe from the INSIDE
 straight out to the edges, and never follow the grooves in a circular
 motion like you would with vinyl.  Other materials to consider may
 include Brasso metal polish and even some toothpastes can be used.

  For heavier marks, car polish or wax can be used. This is thicker than
 furniture polish and will cover the CD in an extra layer, covering up
 marks.  Furniture wax may also be used but remember to try and fill old
 marks rather than go over them as once they are inside the CD layers,
 they cannot be removed as easily.  Also make sure the CD is as shiny as
 possible.  The best all-round solution is to use a vehicle paint skimmer
 such as T-CUT.  This will take off the top layer of paint on a car to
 leave a smooth/shiny surface instead.  The same theory can be applied
 to CD's using the method above.

  This may be an obvious point but you should never worry about marks or
 scratches on the upper side of a CD, the one which has the CD
 information printed on it.  This side is not read by a CD player and
 even if the marks are severe, will not affect playing quality.
 Cleaning this upper side may also result in accidental removal of the
 printed text.
 


 Repairing Other Mediums
 -----------------------
  Flexidiscs can be one of the easiest mediums to break, not only
 because of their micro thin style, which can be bent or even ripped,
 but because the grooves are set in a soft plastic which is prone to
 needle damage.   Care should be taken when handling as well as cleaning
 these discs as they are generally worth more than the average
 recording.   

  Picture discs are just printed vinyl and should be little trouble to
 maintain.  Some picture discs are odd shapes though so care must be
 taken when storing as parts may snap off and ruin a collectors item.


  Other mediums including DAT tapes, old type cartridge cassettes, Sony
 Mini discs and DCC tapes cannot be cleaned or repaired so extra care
 must be used when storing as they are also prone to dust damage. Never
 attempt to gain access to any of these medias as you will probably make
 the problem worse.



 Prevention Rather Than Cure
 ---------------------------
  The best way to keep your items in good condition is to take care of them
properly.  Always store in their original covers/boxes/packaging and never
leave item lying in the open air.  Store everything in cool conditioned and
never leave anything in direct sunlight, for example in front of a window or
on the dashboard of a car.  This will melt most items and completely ruin
vinyl.  Also keep items away from other heat sources like radiators, heaters
or in a kitchen.  

  One of the most important lessons is NEVER place anything near magnets or
anything which contains magnets like speakers or your TV. Magnets are such
dangerous things that it's better not to put anything near them, no matter
what, to save accidental damage.  Speakers are the worst offenders as the
magnets within them are quite powerful, so don't place anything on top of them
and don't put speakers on anything like a storage rack or a video recorder.
Items which can be damaged by magnets include: Tapes, old cartridge tapes, DCC
tapes, Mini Discs, video tapes and computer discs. Vinyl and CDs will be able
to cope much better (but are affected never-the-less) so don't risk it.

 Duran and the Movies
 ====================


  Duran Duran has had more to do with the movies than you may have thought
 possible.  A few examples of their facination with movies are included
 here.

 Love Kills - SYM Productions, Simons own production company, have been
 given the rights to score the whole of this movie.  Although the film
 has not found a distributor, it has passed final checks and is ready for
 release.  All music written for the film will come from SYN including
 incidendal music amnd two of Simons own songs, Dream Boyz (which Simon
 also sings) and Cupid's a Hitman.  The movie should see general release
 sometime this summer.

 The Saint - A recent 1997 version of the classic TV show starring Roger
 Moore.  This time extended into a film and starring Val Kilmer in the
 lead role of Simon Templer.  Simon works for a secret agency who's job
 it is to rid the world of corruption and evil, and it comes as no
 surprise to Simon when his next mission is much of the same thing. Duran
 were originally penciled in to play the background music for the death of
 one of the films co-stars.  This scene was removed and re-shot and so
 there wasn't any need for a 'death scene' song and Durans' Out Of My Mind
 had to be moved to the end credits sequence instead.

 A View To A Kill - Duran plays the title music.  An obvious one to talk
 about and the one most people will think of when talking about Duran and
 films. While at a private dinner, the band were approached by John Barry,
 the producer for the Bond themes at that time.  Duran's Wild Boys had
 already made an impression in the charts and showed the group were ready
 for that kind of action setting, and so they accepted the offer.  The
 film itself is as slick as most other Moore bonds, although the cheesy
 one liners are carried too far at times.  A high class business man
 called Max Zorin is a leading figure in the production of microchips but
 is believed to have stollen the plans to a new design.  Zorin has already
 bought a vast amount of the worlds surplus microchip stock and has been
 buying oil fields near california's silico valley, Bond is sent to find
 out whats going on...

 Barbarella (Queen of the Galaxy) - The film which gave Duran their name.
 During a long drain storming session outside a Birmingham bar, Nick and
 John tried to think of a name for their new band.  After going throught
 various films, John surgested Barbaralla staring Jane Fonda. During their
 early career, Duran also played a lot of gigs in a nightclub called
 Barbarella's in Birmingham. One of the characters in the film is Dr.
 Duran Duran, and the band took the name because it didn't sound like
 anything and couldn't be associated with anything.  Barbarella (Fonda) is
 on a mission, to find and bring back to earth Dr. Duran Duran, who
 disappeared a long time ago on a distant planet.  After crash landing on
 the planet, it's Barbarella's job to reach a city where she thinks Duran
 may be hiding.

 Areana - Durans own attempt at film production.  After the successful
 completion of the Wild Boys video, the band decided to make a full length
 film, with a plot, to promote the Areana tours.  The story is based on
 an old friend from Barbarella, the evil Dr Duran Duran (played my Milo
 O' Shea) who wants to rid the world of Duran as they are the only ones
 who can stop him.

 Gas, Food, Lodging - Alison Anders, a good friend of John and Simon, is
 the director of this film.  John, Simon and Yasmin all played a roll in
 the making of the film, Yasmon having a hand in the consume designing
 and all three being credited on the end titles of the film.  Also look
 out for posters of John and Simon on a boyfriends wall.  The film itself
 follows the fortunes of two sisters and their mother when they move to
 a new desert home.  One sister likes to have a good time and hang around
 with a lots of boyfriends, the other likes old black and white movies
 and matchmaking their mother with new men.

 Playing For Keeps - Duran plays Say The Word, which was missed off
 Arcadia's album So Red The Rose, during one scene in the movie.  

 Threesome - A crude college drama in which Duran plays the B-side to The
 Reflex and cover of cockney rebels song, Make Me Smile (Come Up And See
 Me).  The threesome in question are three college students all sharing
 a flat together, one female (Alex) and two males (Eddy and Stuart). The
 problem is that Alex fancies Eddy, Eddy fancies Stuart and Stuart fancies
 Alex.  

 Tequila Sunrise - Do You Believe In Shame? This is the Duran song playing
 on the radio in one scene of this film starring Mel Gibson and Kurt
 Russell.  The film also boasts a song from Andy Taylor too but both songs
 do become hidden within the dialogue so you may have to listen out. Mel
 Gibson playes an ex coke dealer whos been on the straight and narrow for
 the last few years.  The lights of his life are Michelle Pfiefer, the
 owner of a posh downtown restaurant, and his son who he quit the business
 for.  But just as things are looking up, an old supplier named Carlos
 calls hoping for a major deal, and its Gibsons job to decide what to do.
 To make matters worse, an old cop friend (Russell) finds out and wants
 to catch Carlos for himself, except Gibson is the only one who knows what
 Carlos looks like.

 Mars Attacks - Recommended by Nick, and is much better seen in this
 country than in America appearantly.  A great film which had audiences
 laughing and crying at the same time.  Based on an old US comic strip,
 the main characters are aliens from mars, bent on attacking Earth and its
 enhabitants.  The film was initially released after Independance Day, a
 more serious film in the same vain, and was eager so show that a serious
 film could be handled in a lighter way.

 Jacobs Ladder - Recommended Simon, Nick and Warren.  A film about an
 ex-vietnam veteran who tries to come to turns with the war after he
 return to the US.  Haunted by images of war and violance, his hardest
 battle is trying to retain his sanity, ever drifting closer to the edge.

 Sean Connery Bond Movies - Recommended By John.  It has become common
 knowledge of Johns love for Bond movies, especially the early ones. Fans
 would send him Bond videos while on tour and he would watch then at least
 once a month. The early Bond films were synonymous with style, chic
 sophistication, and action without going over the top with effects or
 funny one liners as many modern film tend to do.

 Raiders of the Lost Ark - Recommended by Andy.  Andy likes action and
 adventure films, especially if they contain Harrison Ford, like Blade
 Runner.  Raiders is an adventure in its fullest scence, taking in
 foreign and exotic locations and helping the main character into all
 sorts of trouble.  The plot takes on many trists as Indana Jones, the
 hero, must track down the fabled Ark of the Covernant, the carrying chest
 of the original ten commandments.  Accourding to his best sources, the
 last known resting place of the Ark has been uncovered by the Nazis in
 an isolated desert site called Tanis.  Indy must get their and recover
 the Ark before it used for evil purposes.

 Casablanca - Recommended by Roger and Nick.  Roger loves old B&W movies,
 Jack Nickolson and Marlon Brando, and this film sums up his feelings for
 the classics.  The film originally intended Ronald Reagan to play the
 lead role, but what they got was Humphrey Bogart and immortality.  The
 plot centres around the meeting Bogy has with his co-star Ingrid Bergman
 in Rick's Cafe Americain and the tangled love story which ensues.

 Come Undone Advertised Sun Cream
 =================================


   To everyones surprise, one of Durans best known songs, Come Undone, was
 chosen as the backing music for a recent suntan cream advert.  Ambre
 Solar, a leading developer in this field chose the music for its 'dreamy'
 sound and supposidly the line 'Cannot but keep from falling appart, at
 the seams'.  Although the song obviously has nothing to do with the sun
 or holidays, and sticks out as a bad choise for this type of ad, it does
 however give the viewer a taste of the song, which can only be a good
 thing.

 
   This ad is the first one to use a Duran song since the Metro Rio ad
 used 'Rio' as its backing track way back in 1993.  Before that, the only
 real TV publicity was for the Decade album in 1989 when a widespread TV
 advertising campain was lanched by EMI to promote the release.  The
 campain lasted about two weeks, with sales slumping after this time.

   whose name has not undergone some change since it was first registered.

 * Andys full name is Andrew Wilson-Taylor since his marrage in July 1982
   to Tracy Wilson

 * Roger has the hairiest legs in Duran history

 * Simons first band were called Dog Days.  At one gig they were fourth on
   the bill and they weren't even allowed to play on stage - they played
   on the floor.

 * Four out of five Duran members prefer Red Roses as their favourate
   flower. Simon preferes rhododendrons.

 * Roger first met John and Nick when they were living in a squat.  He
   auditioned by performing a song called 'See me, repeat me' which later
   turned into Rio.

 * Simon used to be a tree surgeon.

 * One of their roadies is called Chinese Rocks

 * Andy met the others after answering an ad in modody make magazine,
   asking for a 'live-wire' guitarist.

 * When he was five, Simon did a TV Persil ad.  "I was the kid with the
   not-so-white shirt."

 * Simons strangest present from a fan was a box of sand.

 * Simons nickname was Charley.  John's known as JT.  Roger was Froggy
   Barnacle (because of snorkling).  Nick was called Ringo (because he
   hates it) and Andy was the Sniffer (due to his cocaine habit).

 * One of Nicks favourate pastimes is "underwater hang gliding"

 * Simons favourate musician is Chopin.

 * DURANDEMONIUM - IT'S JUST LIKE THE SCREAMING SIXTIES AS FANS MOB FAB
   FIVE, was the headline in the Daily Express on the day of the Lady Di
   concert.

 * During the concert the Daily Mirror reported that that "sex symbol
   Simon le Bon managed to fall over the stage.  Later he crashed into the
   sound apparatus knocking the whole band out of tune."  No doubt trying
   to live up to the Sunday magazines description - "whirling like a
   demented Nureyev."

 * Later, the band admitted that the bass drum pedal broke twice with
   numerous guitar strings snapping and, to cap it all, somebody threw a
   box of chocolates, knocking the bass out of tune.

 * When the band met the royal couple, Prince Charles said to Simon "I
   never knew you had to be so fit?"  And Nick the question was "I rather

 * The debate about Andy Taylor's middle name has drawn three conclusions.
   His birth certificate, first of all, lists no middle name. Another
   argument states that "Arthur" is his middle name. Other sources state
   that Andy took his wife's name as well, turning it into
   "Wilson-Taylor." 

 * When the others first met Simon, he was wearing a pair of pink
   leopardskin punk trousers, a 60's jacket and sunglasses.  Under his
   arm he had an exercise book - inside were sketches for lyrics like
   'On A Dead Child','Underneath The Clocktower', 'Nightboat' and
   'The Chauffeur'.

 * "I've always wanted to go out with a Charlies Angel" - John Taylor

 * "We want to be the band to dance to when the bomb drops" - Simon le Bon

   was the most frightening experience of my life" - Roger Taylor

 * Simon was once almost electrocuted while swimming.  A light fell in the
   pool but luckily someone flicked off the power just in time.

 * Other frightening experiences include Andy being held at gunpoint at

   contract" - John Taylor

 * X-BAN ON DURAN'S VIDEO SHOCKER - Daily Mirror headline.  "I've seen the
   so-called sexy scenes, and I didn't blink an eyelid.  I've seen worse
   on Channel 4", wrote Duran fan Margurite Hamilton in The Mirrors
   letters page regarding the 'saucy scenes' in the Girls On Film video.  

 * LE SEXY SEXY DURAN DURAN - TV Times headline to accompany their
   Midsummer Night's Tube feature.

 * Duran once supported poet John Cooper Clarke and singer Pauline Black

 Oracle Gets Thumbs Up
 =====================

 One of the best places to look for new Duran information is actually in
 your very own home.  Due to the UK's efficient teletext services, it is
 possible to get the latest information at the push of a button.  BBC2
 Oracle (pages 560+) has actually proven the most reliable source,
 mentioning the name of Duran at every opportunity.  Readers of the service
 regularly write in and place messages on 'The Vibe' pages, one recent
 comment informed readers of the August release of Electric Barbarella and
 Medazzaland.  The band name also seems to get quoted on the news pages,
 although not always in the best light.  Oracle was the one of the best
 sources of information about the recent 'Duran Bond Theme' issue,
 relaying information direct from Radio1. Although Sheryl Crow took most
 of the lime light, Duran was mentioned at the end of the report as one of
 the better bond themes.

   Even the quiz pages are worth a look as they regularly include Duran
 questions such as 'What Number in the charts did Duran Durans The Reflex
 reach in 1983?'.  The recent reviews of the Out Of My Mind single on the
 other hand were pretty ropey, talking more about The Saint than the
 song, but the band did find acclaim in the Saint review, finding more
 favourable comments than Bowie's rather 'hip' entry.

  You may also find related Duran news on 4-Tel, channel 4's teletext
 service (pages 480+), although not to the same degree as BBC2.  Reviews
 of Duran releases are always 'average' and news is a little thin when
 the Duran scene is at its quietest.



  But to give to some idea, here's a typical quote from a message on The
 Vibe (BBC2 p561) from 16/8/97 - "I've just heard the new Duran Duran
 single 'Electric Barbarella' which isn't out until September.  This is
 the Duran sound of old making a welcome return, but with a 90's edge. It's
 a dance/pop/rock song, totally awesome."

  And.. (C4 p481) from 24/8/97 - "Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes and Warren
 Cuccurullo have produced two tracks on the forthcoming new album from
 reformed Blondie.  The two tracks are Studio 54 and Pop Trash Movie".

 Out Of My Mind Takes Nose Dive
 ==============================

  Finally, a sneak preview of the songs on the new album Medazzaland.
 Instead of the full album being released, the band decided to pinch a
 few sales from the Saint's soundtrack album and release their own
 material separatly.  The release consists of three new songs an a remix
 for your money, all at varying degrees of quality.

  The main track is titled Out Of My Mind and was the music played over
 the end titles of the movie The Saint.  Its quite a sentimental song and
 gets its point over nicely.  The song feels like it should have been on
 the Arcadia album, especially the remixed version which is even more
 outlandish.  The song does take some getting used to, especially if you
 like their old material rather than their new stuff.  This is where the
 song falls down as the only people who will buy the single are dedicated
 Durannies, who don't care if it does sounds rubbish anyway.  The real bulk
 of the music buying population would rather buy something which is easier
 to get used to and which they can brag about having to their friends.

  This is a real shame as the other two songs will never be played on
 radio so people just won't know what their missing.  Silva Halo is a
 part song, even more outlandish than Out Of My Mind, while Sinner Or Saint
 is a hard rocking noise extravoganza and is one you really can brag
 about to your heavy metal friends.

   Unfortunatly, due to none existant advertising and a rather lame black
 cover, the single didn't do as well as expected, entering the charts at
 No.21 before falling to No.41 the week after.  This hopefully doesn't
 mark the beginning of a loosing streak, but a shakey start to a better
 album..
