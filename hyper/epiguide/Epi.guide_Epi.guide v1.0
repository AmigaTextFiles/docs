"You can't deny there's something between us." -Catwoman "You're right and
I'm afraid it's the law." -Batman

THE CAT AND THE CLAW (PART 1) *** 9/5/92 (#13) Story by Sean Catherine Derek
and Laren Bright.  Teleplay by  Jules Dennis.  Directed by Kevin Altieri.
Animation by Sunrise. Catwoman takes on an evil corporation and a terrorist
organization to save  a mountain lion preserve.  Batman gets involved,
because the terrorists have  hijacked a biological warfare weapon and are
holding Gotham ransom.  Wonderful  action sequences, especially a rooftop
meeting between Catwoman and Batman  storyboarded by director Kevin Altieri.
"I use that as a example of how  to board, when we hire people." said
Altieri.   "It has all my tricks in it.   Lame animation, but the board's
good." Altieri called for an almost impossible bit of animation, a great
scene where  the Red Claw is briefing her men with a slide show staged so she
moves in front  of the projected images during the briefing.  "In cartoons if
you want lines to  bend over characters, it's not a trick, it's real
animation," said Altieri.   "You shouldn't do it.  The chances of it working
are astronomical, but I went  for it anyway, and they did it!  They blew so
many other simpler things, and  this they pulled off."

"Any nut case who dresses up like a bat, sooner or later, is bound to snap."
-Bullock to Mayor Hill

ON LEATHER WINGS **** 9/6/92 (#1) Story and teleplay by Mitch Brian. Directed
by Kevin Altieri.   Animation by Spectrum.

A batlike figure attacks a security guard and Batman is blamed.  Detective
Harvey Bullock is given a Bat-task force by the Mayor and District Attorney
to capture Batman.  We follow Batman's step-by-step investigation, his battle
with police, and the discovery of the Jekyll and Hyde-like character of Dr.
Kirk Langstrom, a.k.a. Man-Bat, a giant half-man, half-bat creature.  All in
all a great introduction to the series.  Harvey Bullock,  District Attorney
Harvey Dent, Police Commissioner Gordon, and Mayor Hill are  introduced in
nicely moody scenes. This episode clearly establishes that Gordon  is not
going to be a sit-by-the-sideline milquetoast like the old live-action
series.  The light and fun version of Bruce Wayne is clearly counterpointed
with his dark brooding Batman persona.  And after the mystery is solved,  the
show climaxes with an incredible aerial battle, dramatically designed  by
director Kevin Altieri and superbly rendered by Spectrum Animation.  "To me,
this is almost the quintissential episode of the show,"  said producer Bruce
Timm.  "It's got almost everything in it that you want,  the mood, the
mystery, and Batman's really cool.  It's got this great villain,  and it's
scary, exciting, and funny." 

"Freeze." -Batman "Mister Freeze to you." -Mr. Freeze

HEART OF ICE ***** 9/7/92 (#14) Story and teleplay by Paul Dini.  Directed by
Bruce Timm.   Animation by Spectrum.

Batman tries to foil Mr. Freeze in his attempts to create a powerful freeze
gun and discovers how corporate executive Mr. Boyle is responsible for
dooming  Freeze to a life in a sub-zero world.  In an entirely new twist on
the  villain, Freeze goes mad, believing all emotion has been frozen out of
him.   Batman tries to stop Freeze from assassinating Boyle, who was
responsible  for the death of Freeze's wife.  The new take on this old comic
book villain came out of early development  talks between producers Eric
Radomski, Bruce Timm and Paul Dini.  Timm came  up with the idea that Freeze
barely escaped dying in a cryogenic experiment  gone wrong, and considers
himself dead.  As a result, he doesn't fear death  and has no emotions. Timm
not only had to act as producer on the show but also as director because they
were so far behind schedule.  Recalled Timm, "I didn't have a storyboard team
so I got Doug Murphy, Phil Norwood, Joe Denton, Mark Wallace, Curt Geda and
Lorenzo Martinez.  I took anyone who had two days available, using people
from other crews that had down time.  They did a very good job and I didn't
have to change a whole lot."  Timm noted he had difficulty getting voice
actor Michael Ansara to play it  "flat" for the role of Freeze/Dr. Fries.  He
was acting too much," said Timm.   "It was really frustrating for him.  He
had never done cartoons before and an actor's first natural instinct is to
act.  He kept giving these line  readings with all this inflection in them. I
kept telling them that it had  to be less, a lot less- like a robot.  He kept
saying it sounded so flat.   Everybody else was looking at me too, and was
asking me if I was sure.   To them it sounded flat.  I think it really sells
it.  I wanted his voice  to sound like the Ebonites in that old OUTER LIMITS
episode: 'Nightmare.'   They sound real metallic and hollow.  I even played
that for him at the  recording session, and explained that was what I wanted
it to sound like.   It drove the sound guys crazy doing it." 

FEAT OF CLAY (PART 1) *** 9/8/92 (#20) Story by Marv Wolfman and Michael
Reaves.  Teleplay by Marv  Wolfman.  Directed by Dick Sebast.  Animation by
AKOM.

The origin of Clayface.  After an accident, actor Matt Hagen is offered an
experimental restorative skin cream to save his face by manufacturer Roland
Daggett.  Unfortunately, the effect is only temporary, and Hage in forced  to
do dirty work for Daggett in order to keep getting his "fix," impersonating
Bruce Wayne so Daggett can take over Wayne Enterprises.  A massive dose of
the restorative cream over his entire body turns Hagen into Clayface.  While
the story moves along fine, most of the people in it are very  unsympathetic,
even Batman.  He interrogates a criminal by terrorizing him.   He smashes up
the guy's car in midair using the Batwing, and then drags him  through the
Gotham River at high speed.  Batman fully lives up to co-author  and story
editor Michael Reaves' vision of the dark avenger:  "He's not the  same
Batman who makes that sanctimonious speech at the end of 'The Underd-
wellers,'" said Reaves.  The animation is only average.  "This was the first
episode done by AKOM's C-Team of animators, and it really bummed us out when
if first came in," said producer Timm.  "That show probably had more retakes
than any other, nearly completely redone two or three times before we could
actually air it without cringing." 

"I'm not an actor anymore.  I'm not even a man." -Clayface

FEAT OF CLAY (PART 2) ***** 9/9/92 (#21) Story by Marv Wolfman and Michael
Reaves.  Teleplay by Michael  Reaves. Directed by Kevin Altieri.  Animation
by TMS. 	 After Matt Hagen discovers he has been turned into Clayface, he
goes after  Daggett's men.  He runs afoul of Batman who stops him from
carrying out  his vengeance.  Then he decides to go after Daggett himself,
when the  corporate bad guy is doing a talk show.  TMS did the best animation
of  the series for this episode.  The second part had maybe six retakes on
the whole show, which is incredible," said producer Bruce Timm.  "The  first
time we saw it in the editing room, we couldn't believe how beautiful  it
was.  It has all those transformation effects that only TMS could do.   It
was after these two episodes that we decided that any two-parters we  did
would have to be done at the same studio."  Timm had a theory why TMS  did
such a good job, which  he felt resulted from Warner Bros' demand that  they
redo the opening sequence for the series.  Noted Timm, "I think when  we
shipped them 'Clayface,' they said to themselves: 'They think they know
everything, but we'll show them how to do this show.  We'll change Batman's
colors.  We'll do special color  key treatments on the villains when they're
walking over the green vat.  We'll blow them away.' If that's their revenge,
thank you for proving us wrong.  I was so happy with that episode."  "The
sequence where Daggett and Germs are walking over that green vat, those
characters look like they're three-dimensional.  They look like they're
rotoscoped.  When Daggett slowly turns toward the camera, the shadows really
wrap around his face.  It's as if they're real!  They did all those colors
themselves.  We couldn't even ask for those colors if we wanted to.  They
aren't even in our palette.  They had to specially mix those colors." Shirley
Walker, supervising music composer for the series, found the task of scoring
this episode quite a challenge.  "It was demanding story-wise," said Walker.
"There was so much going on.  I was so proud of it that I submitted it for
Emmy consideration, and that's the one that I got a nomination for." 

"These are 'dummy' books." -Batman "Yeah, and you're the dummy." -Stromwell,
pulling out a Tommy gun

IT'S NEVER TOO LATE *** 9/10/92 (#11) Story by Tom Ruegger.  Teleplay by
Garin Wolf.  Directed by  Boyd Kirkland. Animation by Spectrum.

Boss Thorne is engaged in a gang war with Arnie Stromwell and Stromwell's son
has disappeared.  Thinking that Thorne has kidnapped his son, Stromwell
arranges a meeting with the crime boss.  But he ends up spending the night
with Batman, who shows him his son has not been kidnapped but is in a drug
detox center recovering from drugs his organization imported.  The gangster
realizes his life is falling apart.  Angry and in danger from Thorne's men,
his only hope is his brother and Batman.  A homage to gangster movies with
references to everything from THE G DFATHER movies to TRUE CONFESSIONS. "It's
a real witty script and Boyd Kirkland did a great job directing it," said
producer Bruce Timm.  "His storyboards were staged brilliantly. There's this
one great shot on the storyboard.  You're looking at a church and the camera
pans to where a restaurant is.  I found that it was the first time I actually
thought of Gotham as a real place.  It's easy for the city to be just a
backdrop, but here it felt like it had geography." Noted director Boyd
Kirkland, "I like shows that get into human dilemmas  where you see into
characters' minds.  This is one of my favorite shows.   Another reason I like
this so much, is that Batman is not driving around  playing catch-up.  He
knows what's going on and is behind-the-scenes  manipulating the situation to
serve his ends.  To me, this is the epitome  of how Batman should be
portrayed."

"You're crazy!" -Joker "I had a good teacher." -Charlie

JOKER'S FAVOR **** 9/11/92 (#22) Story and teleplay by Paul Dini.  Directed
by Boyd Kirkland.   Animation by Dong Yang.

Charlie Collins curses out a fellow motorist on the expressway who
unfortunately turns out to be the Joker.  The villain spares Charlie's  life
in return for an unspecified favor.  Years later, Charlie is brought in on a
plot to kill Commissioner Gordon during a memorial dinner.  A mythic story
seemingly right out of a Joseph W. Campbell treatise, Charlie  Collins is an
average man who encounters the deadly insane world of the Joker  and through
an act of uncommon courage sets himself free.  A scene in the  woods where a
backlit Joker appears to cut his deal with Charlie is  particularly chilling.
In the dinner sequence, Harley Quinn gasses the  banquet members dressed in a
very tight police woman's outfit.  At one  point, she uncrosses her legs in
what the producers termed an unintentional  Sharon Stone scene.  "We didn't
ask for it," said Timm, " but it showed up.   We just hoped the BS&P lady
wouldn't notice."  BASIC INSTINCT has nothing  to worry about.

"Red Claw- a woman?" -Batman "Do you have a problem with that?" -Red Claw

THE CAT AND THE CLAW (PART 2) * 9/12/92 (#16) Story by Sean Catherine Derek
and Laren Bright.  Teleplay by  Jules Dennis. Directed by Dick Sebast.
Animation by AKOM.

Catwoman and Batman both go after corporate villains who threaten Gotham. The
pair are strapped to a stolen container of germs, with acid dropped  on the
outer casing.  Catwoman gets free, and Batman sets up an explosion  to
destroy the facility and the deadly germ warfare canister, while Red  Claw
and Catwoman battle outside.  However, the terrorist escapes. Plot holes
render this almost incomprehensible.  Batman's solution to  destroy an
airborne virus is to blow it up and hope the flames kill it.   And Red Claw,
a typcially stupid villain, decides to duke it out with  Catwoman, instead of
leaving the scene of the crime unscathed.   The animation by AKOM is abysmal.
"The whole end sequence was geared  around the explosions, and they were some
of the worst you'll ever see, "said producer Bruce Timm.  "We retook all of
them two or three times.   They were still awful, but we ran out of time and
had to air them."

"Who are you?" -A crook "I'm your worst nightmare." -Batman

PRETTY POISON *** 9/14/92 (#5) Story by Paul Dini and Michael Reaves.
Teleplay by Tom Ruegger.   Directed by Boyd Kirkland.  Animation by Sunrise.

Poison Ivy attempts to murder Bruce Wayne's best friend, District Attorney
Harvey Dent with a long, deadly poisoned kiss (the length of which was cut by
BS&P.) While Dent is hospitalized, Batman battles Ivy in her greenhouse.
Ivy's persona is that of the standard femme-fatale.  The show is rife with
overt and subtle sexual imagery.  "It wasn't intentional, but the Venus
Fly-trap creature looks like a vagina with teeth," said producer Bruce  Timm.
"Originally, it looked like Audrey II, and I said, 'Naww, let's not  do that,
what other kind of plant can we do?  What if it's like a big  snow-peapod?' I
started sketching it out, and stopped when I realized what  it looked like,
but it worked.  In a way, it's a very good visual metaphor  for what she is,
a man-killer."  For the scene where Poison Ivy slinks out  of a restaurant,
and all the men turn to watch her go, the Sunrise animators  could not
animate her derriere to look as seductive as the producers wanted.   The task
finally fell to storyboard artist Chen-Yi Chang, who animated the  sequence
at Warner Bros with cels shipped overseas for Sunrise to film.

"I am vengeance.  I am the night.  I am Batman."

NOTHING TO FEAR *** 9/15/92 (#3) Story and teleplay by Henry Gilroy & Sean
Catherine Derek.   Directed by Boyd Kirkland.  Animation by Dong Yang.

The Scarecrow is trying to destroy Gotham's University, because they stopped
him from continuing his fear experiments there while he was a professor.
Batman exposed to his fear gas begins to have hallucinations of his father
reprimanding him as a disappointment.  Too episodic for its own good, this
show features the origin of the Master of Fear, The Scarecrow.  While there
is an absolutely stunning battle aboard a flaming dirigible that makes up for
most of the bad pacing, the ending is predictable, with the Scarecrow  foiled
by his own fear gas.  A silent epilogue with Bruce putting roses on  his
parents' grave is beautifully animated and a wonderful touch to an  otherwise
mediocre script.  "It was written by Henry Gilroy, who had never  written
cartoons before," said producer Bruce Timm.  "He was a film editor  here and
always wanted to get into writing.  At the time we didn't have a  story
editor, so we gave it a go.  When he turned in his first draft, which  wasn't
bad, we had hired our first story editor, Sean Derek.  We immediately  came
to loggerheads over this show.  Some of the dialogue she changed wasn't
changed for the better."  This was the test show for Dong Yang, one of the
series most reliable overseas animation studios.  They pulled it off
beautifully with only one glitch, the studio changed the look of the main
villain.  "On the model sheets, the original design looked really great,"
said Timm.  "We drew him as if his body was all busted up, giving him this
really weird scarecrow posture all very bent and twisted.  However, when Dong
Yang animated him they straightened his posture.  We changed him for
subsequent episodes."  An oddity in this show is the fact that while BS&P's
cardinal rule is that no one can be killed in the series, they allowed a
flaming zeppelin to crash in downtown Gotham City, never commenting on the
surrounding buildings or the people in the street it must have landed on.

"It's a birthday candle I designed.  This one blows you out." -Joker to party
guests

BE A CLOWN **** 9/16/92 (#9) Story and teleplay by Ted Petersen and Steve
Hayes.  Directed  by Frank Paur. Animation by AKOM. 	 The Joker crashes the
Mayor's son's birthday party as Jecko the Clown, and  plants a bomb at the
Mayor's mansion.  the mayor's estranged son runs away  from home and hops on
the Joker's getaway truck that takes them both to an  abandoned amusement
park.  The boy gets taken under the Joker's wing and  when Batman appears,
the boy is confronted with the danger he's been in  all the time, as the
Joker reveals Batman in a deathtrap.  During the  climactic rollercoaster
chase, the Joker's lapel flower originally squirted  acid, making the scene
much more dangerous, but BS&P said that was too  threatening and it was
changed to the flower squirting gas.  Noted producer  Bruce Timm, who came up
with the idea for the show, "I started with this  image of Batman and this
kid who is in some kind of peril.  At the time I  thought of a burning
building.  The kid is deathly afraid of Batman,  because he is so scary.  And
Batman is not used to dealing with kids,  because he's just a dark avenger of
the night.  Batman yells at the kid  to give him his hand and the kid backs
away.  So in the midst of all this  flaming debris,  Batman conciously has to
calm down and try to be nice.   There's supposed to be this touching moment
where the kid breaks down and  takes Batman's hand."  Timm credited
storyboard artist Phil Norwood for  the brilliant bit of the Joker tapping
his cane along a fence, and for  staging the rollercoaster finale in an
exciting but economical fashion.   "We knew immediately that we didn't have
the budget that Disney's ROLLER  COASTER RABBIT did," said Timm.  "We had to
figure out a way of doing all  that really neat fast action on a roller
coaster without having to animate  perspective.  Norwrood figured out a lot
of interesting little cheats, and  fortunately AKOM pulled it off, which they
don't normally do."  Noted  director Frank Paur, "I still had the same
storyboard crew I had on 'The  Underdwellers' and I was still having problems
with them.  A freelancer  jumped ship on me and Bruce Timm shut himself off
in his room and did a  wonderful job storyboarding the second act."

APPOINTMENT IN CRIME ALLEY ***** 9/17/92 (#26)  Story and teleplay by Gerry
Conway.  Directed by Boyd  Kirkland.  Animation by Dong Yang.

Roland Daggett can't convince the city to condemn Crime Alley, when he  wants
to build a development there, so he plans to blow up the street  and make it
look like an exploding gas main.  His demolition men capture  the woman who
raised Bruce Wayne after his parents were killed, Dr. Leslie  Thompkins,
[there is no evidence on the show that Leslie raised Bruce- it  seems more
likely that Alfred did. -JW]  and when she misses her annual  appointment at
the crime site with Batman, the Caped Crusader Batman goes  looking to find
her.  "It's the one show that makes me cry at the end,"  said producer Bruce
Timm.  "It's very understated."  Noted story editor  Michael Reaves.
"Originally this story was written to satisfy a request by the network.  They
wanted a day in the life of Batman.  We tried to  make that work,and realized
we couldn't, because you need an engine to  drive the story.  There had to be
some reason for us to keep watching."  Features an incredible sequence in
which Batman attempts to stop a runaway  trolley by blocking it with the
Batmobile.

"Freeze maggots!  You're all under arrest." -Bullock to crooks

P.O.V.  ***1/2 9/18/92 (#7) Story by Sean Catherine Derek, Laren Bright and
Mitch Brian.   Teleplay by Derek and Bright.  Directed by Kevin Altieri.
Animation by  Spectrum.

An homage to RASHOMAN.  Cops Harvey Bullock, Renee Montoya, and rookie Wilkes
are being questioned about a botched arrest and the subsequent torching of a
warehouse involving Batman.  The three tell their stories,  and the internal
affairs officer, Lt. Hackle, demands their badges.  The flashbacks showing
the officer's stories are almost without dialogue, leaving the story to be
told solely by the action on the screen, a masterful job of direction by
Kevin Altieri with stunning animation by Spectrum. Altieri recalled the
script was much more complex when he received it:  "We cut out flashbacks to
Montoya's youth when she was called a liar.   And flashbacks to Bullock's
youth when he was playing high-school football  when his dad yells at him
because he was using teamwork: 'Don't be a team  player, be a star.  Being a
team player is for losers.  Go out for Number  One, Pal." The cuts
necessitated the addition of an action fight scene  at the end as Montoya
tracks the criminals to a warehouse by the docks.   "BS&P had a fit because
there was so much violence," said Timm.  "I had  to dance around it by
explaining the difficulties created when we took  out all those flashbacks.
They had us make a number of changes.   Originally, the scene where the
driller is going after Montoya with the  drill went on a lot longer.  The guy
chased her on top of a big pile of  crates and he was ramming the drill into
the crates. We got into a lot of  trouble with that. (BS&P's) Avery Coburn
said it was the most horrible rape  fantasy sequence she'd ever seen.  We
agreed immediately to take that whole  sequence out, but because it upset her
so much, she really went to town on  that whole episode." 

"I'm here to clean your clock, Fugate." -Batman

THE CLOCK KING **** 9/21/92 (#25) Story and teleplay by David Wise.  Directed
by Kevin Altieri.  Animation by Nippon/Sunrise.

Another off-hand comment by Mayor Hill, like his comment that incenses the
Joker in "Be A Clown," sets him up as a target for another super villain, the
Clock King, who believes the mayor has ruined his life.  The show ends in an
incredible giant Clock tower battle with the Mayor's life hanging in  the
balance.  "The Clock King was always planned as 'the most anal-retentive
person on the planet,"  said producer Bruce Timm, "A straight guy with this
little bowler hat and suit and briefcase.  We originally intended it to
suggest a stiff-upper-lip British gentleman.  When the show came back, he was
wearing brown.  It ruined it for me.  He just looks like a normal guy, not a
supervillain.  So we're bringing him back next season, and he'll be  in all
black."  The Clocktower battles, storyboarded by Brad Rader, is  director
Kevin Altieri's homage to CASTLE CAGLIOSTRO, a Japanese feature  animated by
Miyazaki.  "That movie is what got me into animation," said  Altieri.  "I was
happy doing special effects in films, until I saw  Miyazaki's work.  It's
limited animation, but he's telling a real story  with real emotion."  

"Not a funny bone in his entire body." -Alfred about Batman

THE LAST LAUGH *** 9/22/92 (#4) Story and teleplay by Carl Swenson.  Directed
by Kevin Altieri.   Animation by AKOM.

It's April Fools Day and the Joker is steering a garbage barge down the river
while pumping a deadly laughing gas throughout Gotham.  The city  is helpless
with laughter, and the Joker's robbing it blind.  Batman gets dumped in the
middle of Gotham harbor by the Joker's robot henchman  Captain Clown.
Director Kevin Altieri plussed the script with more  exciting action, devised
with storyboard artists Brad Rader and Tony  Salmons.  "Other than
dialogue,what you see on screen doesn't really  resemble the script at all,"
said Altieri.  "In the original, Batman  kept getting garbage dumped on him."
Altieri also came up with a new  weapon for the Joker, to stave off Batman on
a catwalk.  Noted Altieri,  "While I was storyboarding that sequence I
wondered what would the Joker  do? Throw a knife?  No.  I thought of the old
poker trick with the card  up the sleeve, and it would be a stainless-steel
card.  Zwock!" The producers learned a valuable lesson about Broadcast
Standards and  Practices in Batman's fight with the robot henchman Captain
Clown.   "We found out that we would beat the crap out of him, because he's a
robot," said producer Bruce Timm.  "It was great.  We didn't know if we could
get away with that, but we took a chance.  We had Batman pick up a pipe and
bash him in the head, and there was no objection." "That was the first Joker
show that Shirley Walker scored," said Timm.   "Her Joker theme was hip-hop.
It was so far away from the Danny Elfman  sound, I was stunned. But then I
thought;"Man, this is really cool."

ETERNAL YOUTH *** 9/23/92 (#29) Story and teleplay by Beth Bornstein.
Directed by Kevin  Altieri.  Animation by Sunrise.

Poison Ivy is luring polluting industrialists to her spa, Eternal Youth. Once
there she begins a process that will turn them all into trees.  When she
can't get Bruce Wayne, she does her dirty work on Alfred and his lady friend
Maggie.  Director Kevin Altieri's staging saves a weak script, especially his
idea for the giant tree that destroys Eternal Youth,  which grows out of
control after Batman spills growth formula on it.   The resulting mile-high
tree where the building used tobe is something  that only animation can do.
"There are things in scripts that are too  mundane and you just have to
restructure it to work for animation," said  Altieri.  "There are things that
animation does really well.  If the  script doesn't have a recognition of
that fact, any show I'm doing will,  by the time it gets on the air.  I think
I'm pretty good at that.  In  this episode, the giant tree was added by Brad
Rader and myself." A minor problem is that Poison Ivy is off-model throughout
the show.   "Storyboard artist Mike Goguen gave us these really sexy drawings
of  Poison Ivy," said Altieri.  "And the animator overseas redrew her to be
his idealized version of a woman.  She's supposed to be petite and girlish,
with a deep sexy voice.  He drew her like a long-limbed woman."

"If there's anything I know, it's how to keep a secret." -Bruce Wayne to
Harvey Dent

TWO FACE (PART 1) ***** 9/25/92 (#10) Story by Alan Burnett.  Teleplay: Randy
Rogel.  Directed by  Kevin Altieri.  Animation by TMS.

Under the strain of running for re-election, D.A. Harvey Dent begins to  get
excessively violent.  Under fire by Boss Thorne's men and some bad  press
because of his temper, Dent begins to crack.  A fall into a chemical  vat
disfigures his face.  In the final scene, he runs out on his fiance  Grace
and into the stormy night.  A magnificent show, featuring the  dynamite
animation of TMS.  The characters come alive in a story by  producer Alan
Burnett, delivering on the promice of having adult situations  and real
emotions, the beginning of a strong upswing in quality for the  series.  "It
was better than anything the comics had ever done on that  character," said
director Kevin Altieri of Burnett's story.  "I'm pretty  notorious for
changing scripts, which I don't do with malice, but for a  love of the
medium.  But that script didn't need to be changed very much.   there were
embellishments I gave to it, like adding the rainstorms to the  staging of
the psychiatrist's office."

"At last we meet, face to face to face." -Thorne to Two-Face

TWO FACE (PART 2) **** 9/28/92 (#17) Story and teleplay by Randy Rogel.
Directed by Kevin Altieri.   Animation by Dong Yang.

Two-Face is finally tipped over the edge into madness by the loss of his
face, his life as Dent, and his fiancee Grace.  He decides to destroy  Boss
Thorne's operations in Gotham City by violent means.  Thorne kidnaps  Grace
and she leads Two-Face into a trap.  "This is such an adult show  that I bet
kids don't like it," said producer Timm.  "There's not a whole  lot of action
and Batman's hardly in it.  It's a lot of talking heads.  But it works on
such a powerful emotional level that I'm sure that anyone  over the age of
six is going to get sucked right into it.  It's absolutely  compelling.  They
always talk about the BATMAN films as being oh, so  psychological.  Bull.
This episode is a compelling psychological drama." The show's animation by
Dong Yang isn't up to the standards of TMS on  Part 1, but director Kevin
Altieri defended the studio.  "It looks just  like the layouts," said
Altieri.  "In part one, really great animators  took some liberties from the
layouts we provided."  

"I'll drive real slow." -Batman, after Robin's exposure to fear gas

FEAR OF VICTORY *** 9/29/92 (#24)  Story and teleplay by Samuel Warren
Joseph.  Directed by Dick  Sebast. Animation by TMS.

Scarecrow is instilling fear in Gotham's great athletes and then betting
against their team to win money for chemicals.  while Robin and Batman are on
their way to interrogate the Scarecrow at Arkham, they see a robbery in
progress. [This is wrong... when they see the robbery in progress Robin is
first affected by the fear gas, which leads Batman to suspect the Scarecrow
and visit him at Arkham- JW]  In their attempt to stop the robbery high  atop
a skyscraper, Robin is petrified with fear in a nice VERTIGO inspired
sequence.  The Scarecrow has paid off a guard to excape but the Dynamic  Duo
foil his plan to fix a Gotham Knights football game, and Robin in spite  of
his fear rescues the crowd from The Scarecrow's fear chemical.  Excellent
direction and beautiful backgrounds let you ignore the sometimes  great,
sometimes awful animation in this episode.  One charming scene  involves
Batman falling through the apartment window of a woman dressed  only in a
bathrobe, and her predictable but well-done reaction, accomplished  with only
her sigh prompting a smile and a wave good-bye from Batman. "Great TMS
animation for a really stupid story," said producer Bruce Timm.   "A favorite
sequence in that episode is where Scarecrow is going to that  closed down
arena, followed by the thug.  There's some really nice staging  there, really
creepy and spooky."

I'VE GOT BATMAN IN MY BASEMENT *** 9/30/92 (#12)  Story and teleplay by Sam
Graham and Chris Hubbell.   Directed by Frank Paur.  Animation by Dong Yang.

A nice kid's show in which a boy and girl discover the Penguin's hideout, and
end up having to keep a drugged, unconscious Batman away from the villain,
hiding the Caped Crusader at home in teh basement.  The final battle between
Batman, armed only with a screwdriver, and the Penguin,  armed witha blade
from his sword-umbrella, is silly.  "I think that if  we hadn't gotten Alan
Burnett to come over, we would have had a lot more  shows like this one,"
noted director Frank Paur of the producer who  stepped in to take control of
the show's script process first season.   Paur also disliked arming Batman
with a screwdriver, but had his hands  full wrestling with an as yet
unsatisfying storyboard crew.  "I had to  get rid of most of these boards and
start from scratch," he said.  "It  was very time-consuming.  Our schedule
was so tight, that small things  got by."  Noted producer Bruce Timm, "I
can't even watch that show. It's  the epitome of what we don't want to do
with Batman.  Strangely enough  kids like it. The script came in and it was
terrible.  Normally, I tell  the director to do what he can to make it
interesting, and nobody could  figure out a way to make it interesting.  The
storyboard artists didn't  care, and it shows."


"I've had cats that made more noise than you."  -Commissioner Gordon to
Batman

VENDETTA *** 10/5/92 (#21) [hphri@chevron.com pointed out that Feat of Clay
Part 2 is also listed as #21.  Should anyone know the real episode number,
please let me know.  -JW] Story and teleplay by Michael Reaves.  Directed by
Frank Paur.   Animation by Spectrum.

A series of crimes are being committed in Gotham and the prime suspect is
Detective Harvey Bullock.  Commissioner Gordon believes he's innocent and
when Batman digs deeper, he discovers Killer Croc is trying to settle an  old
score by framing Bullock.  "This show has a lot of stupid stuff in it  like
Batman finds a toothpick and figures it's Bullock," said producer  Bruce
Timm.  "Duh!  But it's one of those shows that works purely on a  visceral
level.  It's well-staged and the animation is good.  It's really  moody. It's
raining throughout the entire episode, which is really cool." Director Frank
Paur praised Spectrum's animation.  "We wanted to keep the  show heavy on the
mist, the rain.  I wanted reflections, mist, gentle rain  to play up the
whole motif.  I was really worried at first that it would  go to a bad
studio."  Story editor Michael Reaves' script was edited by  Martin Pasko.
Paur redid the last act himself.  "The original ending had  a fight in the
sewer between Batman and Killer Croc," said Paur.  "Killer  Croc escapes to a
Seaworld park where he gets knocked into a pool of  electric eels."

PROPHECY OF DOOM ** 10/6/92 (#19)  Story by Dennis Marks.  Teleplay by Sean
Catherine Derek.  Directed by Frank Paur.  Animation by AKOM.

A con man posing as a clairvoyant is suckering rich millionaires by
predicting disasters and then making them come true.  Batman tracks Nostromos
down, and the show ends with a climactic battle in an observatory full of ten
foot tall models of planets carooming around each other. This is an
astoundingly average show, that only works if you can buy the  fact that
these millionaires are so incredibly gullible.  It seems only  Bruce Wayne
has the common sense to run a security check on Nostromos.   None of the
others bothered to find out he was an ex-con.  The most  disappointing thing
in the show is the animation.  The scene in the  observatory falls flat.  "If
that whole end sequence with the spinning  worlds in the observatory had gone
to Junio or any other studio, it  might have come off, but it went to AKOM,"
said Bruce Timm.  "They  just weren't able to pull off that level of
animation."  "That broke  my heart" said director Frank Paur.  "I designed
those planets using a  circle template.  How hard is it to animate circles?
It was done by hand,  and if we had done it now, it would have been done on
computer and would  have looked spectacular.  When I knew the show was going
to AKOM, a studio  I'd had a long history with, I knew they weren't going to
be able to pull  it off.  Admittedly, it was a tough sequence, but they
should have been  able to do it."

""Only vampires loathe daylight more than Batman." -Alfred

THE FORGOTTEN ***1/2 10/8/92 (#8)  Story by Sean Catherine Derek and Gary
Greenfield.  Teleplay  by Jules Dennis, Richard Mueller and Sean Catherine
Derek.  Directed by  Boyd Kirkland.  Animation by Dong Yang.

Batman goes undercover to find out who's kidnapping homeless men.  Captured
himself, he's brought to a mine in a desert location and temporarily loses
his memory.  After defending one of his fellow prisoners he's thrown into the
"box."  The heat brings on hallucinations that reveal who he is and escapes.
In the meantime, Alfred has been searching for him, eventually bringing the
Batwing and the Batman costume.  One by one, Batman picks  off the guards in
a great action sequence set in a a mine.  Alfred's  detective work, Wayne's
hallucinations in the box, and the final tunnel  battles (lit in stark black
and white, a suggestion by producer Eric  Radomski), are handled with enough
innovation and wit to keep the story  moving rapidly. This is another message
show put forth by the original  story editors.  "I didn't want to do this
show from the very beginning,"  said producer Bruce Timm.  "Sean Derek was
big on doing shows with social messages.  And my big problem with message
shows, is that you can't solve  the world's problems in a half hour cartoon.
If you raise the issue of  homelessness,  what can you do?  It makes the
episode look very exploitive,  because you're just using the problem as an
exotic background.  You can't  discuss the problem on any meaningful level in
a 22-minute action cartoon.   So I put in the dream sequence with Bruce in
the barracks where these  multitudes of people are looking to Bruce for a
handout, and he doesn't  have enough money for them all, and they're
surrounding him and suffocating  him.  It's not enough for him to put a
band-aid on the problem at the end,  by offering the two guys a job.  It just
doesn't work."  BS&P undercut  the script's essential message, as director
Boyd Kirkland explained:  "There was a sequence at the beginning where Batman
is wandering around  the city, trying to find out why people were
disappearing.  It was staged  with homeless people hanging around on
sidewalks:  families, mothers and  kids.  They made us take all that out of
the boards.  They said it was too much for kids to see that maybe a woman or
a family can be out on the  streets.  They specifically asked that we only
show men as homeless."

"I'll prepare your usual breakfast, sir: toast, coffee, bandages." -Alfred to
Bruce Wayne

MAD AS A HATTER ****1/2 10/12/92 (#27)  Story and teleplay by Paul Dini.
Directed by Frank Paur.   Animation by AKOM.

The Mad Hatter origin: Jervis Tetch, a scientist at Wayne Enterprises,
creates a mind control device and attempts first to woo his young
receptionist Alice and then to totally dominate her.  Batman and the  Mad
Hatter have a deadly confrontation in an Alice in Wonderland amusement  park
filled with costumed mind-controlled slaves.  This is one of the most
touching shows of the series.  You sympathize with the love-sick  Jervis
Tetch, and almost feel sad for him when his dreams of Wonderland  don't come
true.  The emotional impact of the story is helped immeasurably  by AKOM's
surprisingly good animation of subtle facial expressions and  body language.
And Roddy McDowall's performance as the Hatter helps sell  the story
completely.  "Paul Dini really excels at those doomed love  stories," noted
producer Bruce Timm.	"It's one of my favorite scripts", said director Frank
Paur.  "Paul Dini does some wonderful stuff with  characters.  I started
getting my regular storyboard crew together on  this one:  Rondaldo Del
Carmen, Butch Lukic, and Lorenzo Martinez.   Ronnie does these wonderful,
fully expressive drawings, he's very good  with the acting- 'A fucking
genius,' said Bruce Timm- Butch is really  able to do a lot staging the
action sequences.  Lorenzo has a Disney  background and his boards are lovely
to look at, !full of mood and  character.  While it's AKOM's best show, we
still had close to a  hundred retakes on it."

"Got a new toy, I see."  -Batman to Gordon about the Batsignal.

THE CAPE & COWL CONSPIRACY * 10/14/92 (#31).  Story and teleplay by Elliot S.
Maggin.  Directed by  Frank Paur.  Animation by Dong Yang.

Wormwood, a professional procurer of illegal goods is operating in Gotham,
and has been hired by the Baron to acquire Batman's cape and cowl.   Though
based on a cool comic story, this doesn't translate to animation.   It
becomes a gimmick show and not a very good one.  Wormwood is lackluster  and
there is no real motivation for Batman to play mind games with him.   Though
the animation from Dong Yang is fine, it doesn't save a faltering  episode.
"I tried to kill this show, but they didn't let me," said director  Frank
Paur.  "We had a lot of story board artists who wanted to rebel on  this one.
the best metaphor is kicking a dead horse.  It arrived dead and  no matter
how hard you kick it, it ain't going to give you a ride."

"You're not well, Mr. Wayne.  You need professional help." -Batman

PERCHANCE TO DREAM **** 10/19/92 (#30)  Story by Laren Bright and Michael
Reaves.  Teleplay by  Joe Lansdale.  Directed by Boyd Kirkland.  Animation by
Dong Yang.

Batman is knocked unconcious chasing criminals and wakes up in a world  where
his parents are still alive and someone else is Batman.  In fact,  Bruce
Wayne's engaged to Selina Kyle, who's not Catwoman.  Eventually,  he rejects
this reality and confronts his alter-ego in a dynamic battle  in a church
tower during a tremendous storm.  In the flashes of lightning,  the real
villain is revealed.  Story editor Michael Reaves explained  the genesis of
the show:  "Alan Burnett had the idea of Batman waking  up one morning and
finding out he'd never been Batman.  It was a very  TWILIGHT ZONE sort of
concept that I really liked.  He gave it to (story  editor) Laren Bright for
an outline, but was not satisfied with her take  on it.  She didn't take the
idea as far as it could go.  This is a story  who even though he's been given
the opportunity for his most important  dream to come true, has to have the
truth no matter how much it hurts.   He can't live a lie.  I rewrote it with
that in mind and I assigned the  teleplay to Joe Lansdale, who did a terrific
job.  His dialogue carried  the show.  I think it's one of our best
episodes."  The show is a wonder,  taking a potentially cliched idea and
making it work beautifully. Credit  the voice characterizations of Kevin
Conroy and Roddy McDowall.  Conroy  not only did the voice of Batman but also
Bruce Wayne, Wayne's father and  the evil Batman, reading the script in real
time, alternating between  characters in a grand performance.  McDowall, as
The Mad Hatter the villain behind the deceptions, reaches new heights as the
man so tortured by Batman  that he was willing to give his gravest enamy
whatever he desired, as  long as it kept him out of his life.  McDowall's
tirade at the end of  the episode is a tour de force full of astonishment and
anger.  Noted Timm  of directing McDowall, "In the recording session, we had
to push him.  We  told him he had to be more angry.  He couldn't quite do it.
We finally  told him to go as far as he could go.  Take it way over the top.
Way over  what he normally would do if he was in a theater.  With that he
gave us  the intensity we wanted." 

THE UNDER-DWELLERS ** 10/21/92 (#6) Story by Tom Ruegger.  Teleplay by Jules
Dennis and Richard  Mueller.  Directed by Frank Paur.  Animation by Junio.

Street kids are being captured and dominated by the Sewer-King, who
incidentally has an army of alligators, grown from pets flushed down the
toilets of Gotham.  A silly show with great direction by Frank Paur that
keeps the action moving as Batman investigates the gang of young thieves. "It
was my first episode as director, and there are still things in it  that I
cringe at," said director Frank Paur.  Usually when we get an  episode, we
get to use a lot of discretion and change things.  I wish  I had been able to
spend more time on that script.  Another problem at  the time, was that we
had storyboard people who made things difficult.   I found myself going back
two or three times to fix scenes.  They didn't  quite understand we were
shooting for a higher standard.  So there was  always a constant drain on my
time.  "That whole opening sequence of  the kids playing chicken with the
train should have been cut.  That was  what we had to contend with at the
beginning of the season.  We had these  little public service announcements
worked into the scripts, a concept  we nixed real quick."  The animation is
also subpar.  "It's Junio's  weakest episode," said producer Bruce Timm.  "We
almost didn't use them  after that.  It was the first one that came back that
really looked  totally unlike our show.  It was very Japanese.  But I'm glad
we did  use them again, they've done great work.  "BS&P took a lot out of
this  show," continued Timm.  "Originally, the kids were to be victimized by
the Sewer-King, but he was not allowed to be mean or tortorous to any  of
them.  The impact is watered down.  If we were doing it today, we  probably
would have decided not to do the show."

NIGHT OF THE NINJA *** 10/26/92 (#34)  Story and teleplay by Steve Perry.
Directed by Kevin  Altieri.  Animation by Sunrise.

While Bruce Wayne was in Japan learning the martial arts, he made a  bitter
enemy of one of his fellow students, Kyodai Ken.  He humiliated  him when he
caught the young man attempting to steal the sensei's samurai  sword.  Years
later, Kyodai Ken, now a ninja, comes to destroy the Wayne  Empire.  A minor
episode in the series, its narrative hook being that  Kyodai Ken may be the
only one able to best Batman in hand-to-han combat.   Because of this, we
come to believe that Batman may be afraid of him.   The plot tries to build
on this tension, by having Robin save Batman from  the duplicitous villain
early in the show, leading to a final battle to  answer the question of who
is better.  The show's animation by Sunrise  fails to come alive,
disappointing director Kevin Altieri, a martial  artist, who along with
storyboard artist Brad Rader studied Akido, and  tried to make the fight
moves as realistic as possible.

THE STRANGE SECRET OF BRUCE WAYNE *** 10/29/92 (#36)  Story by David Wise.
Teleplay by Judith and Garfield  Reeves-Stevens.  Directed by Frank Paur.
Animation by AKOM.

A Gotham judge is being blackmailed by Dr. Hugo Strange.  Bruce Wayne goes
undercover to Strange's retreat and is forced to reveal his secret identity.
While Strange holds Batman and Alfred prisoner, he offers to auction off
Batman's secret identity to the Joker, Two-Face and Penguin.  The opening  on
Gotham Bridge has some of the best animation in the series but the last  two
acts are mediocre, with silly dialogue after the supervillains were
introduced.  "I have a problem with the villain team-ups," said producer
Bruce Timm.  "I think it diminishes them.  When you put Penguin, Joker  and
Two-face all in one scene, suddenly they're all about one-third as
interesting as they would be by themselves.  And unfortunately this show
proves my point.

"I've made her what she's always wanted to be.  I gave her power and grace

TYGER,TYGER  ** 10/30/92  (#41)  Story by Michael Reaves and Randy Rogel.
Teleplay by  Cherie Wilkerson.  Directed by Frank Paur.  Animation by

Dr. Emile Dorian, a mad scientist, captures Catwoman to experiment on her  in
hopes of creating the ultimate animal.  Batman travels to the doctor's island
hideout to save Catwoman and must battle Dorian's other deadly mutations
including Tygrus, a giant catman.  One of the series' weakest shows with
cliche piled upon cliche, including swipes from THE ISLAND OF  DR. MOREAU as
well as THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME.  Producer Bruce Timm was  pleased with the
show's jungle chase sequence.  "Batman is out there,and  there's no music,"
said Timm.  "The atmosphere is created entirely by  sound effects, weird
mutated animal screeches.  It's spooky and well  staged.

"The great Batman scared out of his mind.  How does it feel?" -Scarecrow

DREAMS IN DARKNESS ****1/2 11/3/92 (#28)  Story and teleplay by Judith &
Garfield Reeves-Stevens.   Directed by Dick Sebast.  Animation by Junio.

The show opens with Batman in a straitjacket in Arkham Asylum.  We come  to
learn that he has been exposed to the Scarecrow's fear gas and is
hallucinating wildly, but must stop the villain from pouring a fear-inducing
solution into Gotham City's water supply.  Not only must he escape the
Asylum, but battle the Scarecrow's men while hallucinating wildly.  This is a
great plot.  Batman is up to his neck in trouble and must  overcome obstacle
after obstacle.  The episode features some top animation  by Junio.  And Dick
Sebast pulls off the best of the Scarecrow shows.   There are great touches
like the Scarecrow's Grim Reaper watch, the slow- motion crack up of the
Batmobile, and the show-stopping nightmare with  the symbolic death of
Wayne's parents with a giant revolver rising out  of the city's rubble.  "One
of my absolutely favorite shows, it works  like gangbusters," said producer
Bruce Timm.  "There's never a dull  moment.  There's always something witty
happening, either visually, or  in the dialogue."  "The nightmare sequence is
a killer," said Timm.   "The gun is dripping blood!  How did that ever get
past BS&P?  It wasn't  intended to be blood, it was intended to be wreckage
from the street.   But they painted it red, and it looks like this big old
gun dripping blood.   My God!  -At the mixing stage, I had to fight with the
music editor, Tom  Milano, who's really good, about the way the music had
been cued.  It ran  all the way up to firing of this large gun.  Then it
stops.  I felt it  wasn't working, because the music was fighting this great
effect of those  big huge cylinders cocking into place on the gun that the
sound effects  guys had come up with.  I thought we had to stop the music
before the  cylinders cocked and told Tom I really wanted to try it this way.
Eric  agreed, so we set it up.  Now the music stops just two beats sooner.
And  the sound of that gun is like the Crack of Doom right before it fires.
It really sells it."

"Time for all little Gray Ghosts to be in bed." -Mr. Wayne to young Bruce in
flashback

BEWARE THE GRAY GHOST ***** 11/4/92 (#18)  Story by Dennis O'Flaherty and Tom
Ruegger.  Teleplay by  Garin Wolf and Tom Ruegger.  Directed by Boyd
Kirkland.  Animation by Dust.

Someone is bombing Gotham's municipal buildings using the same M.O. as a
villain in the old Gray Ghost TV show.  Batman goes to the actor that  played
his childhood hero for help and is disappointed when Simon Trent  wants
nothing more to do with the role that ruined his career.  Finally,  the actor
dons his old costume to help Batman catch the Mad Bomber. The Gray Ghost
resembles the old pulp heroes of the '30s like the Shadow,  the Spider, or
the original Green Hornet: fedora, suit, and twin automatics.   The show is
the only episode done by the studio, Dust, because the  characters were
terribly off-model.  "This was a lot of fun," said Producer  Radomski.  "When
we had first gotten the script on that, we all went:  'This would be perfect
for Adam West, but do you think he'd be offended  because of the content.'
But he was more than happy to do it.  It was  great to have this aging hero
play this aging hero." It was also fun  because producer Timm played the Mad
Bomber; "It was interesting to see  him in there," said Radomski, chuckling.
"We gave him hell."  Time  described a few of the show's in-jokers.  "The
Gray Ghost is Batman's  boyhood hero, and The Shadow was Bob Kane's
inspiration for Batman.   That's doubled by the fact that Adam West was my
childhood hero and my  inspiration for getting into Batman."  Other in-jokes
include a People  magazine cover with the Gray Ghost is casting Batman's
shadow, and the  violator reads: "Matt Hagen: Man of a Million Faces."  In a
Batcave  shrine to the Gray Ghost, the poster on the wall has the Gray Ghost
in  the same post as Batman is in the series logo.  

CAT SCRATCH FEVER **1/2 11/5/92 (#35)  Story by Sean Catherine Derek.
Teleplay by Buzz Dixon and  Sean Catherine Derek.  Directed by Boyd Kirkland.
Animation by AKOM.

Roland Daggett and Dr. Milo are injecting a virus into the cats of Gotham, so
that later Daggett Industries could provide the antidote, be the hero  and
make millions.  They make one mistake.  They kidnap Catwoman's cat,  Isis.
Jst out of jail she tries to stop the pair and is infected with  the toxin
when her cat bites her.  Batman not only has to fight Daggett  and company
but a feverish, hallucinating Catwoman.   Dr. Milo proves once again that he
is a lame excuse for a mad scienctist.   The only redeeming quality of the
show is the interplay between Batman  and Catwoman and the staging by
Kirkland.  "We retook that show considerably  just to make it watchable" said
Timm.  "It was a mess, we had AKOM reanimate  that one from scratch.  That
was the show that broke out back with AKOM  and we decided we weren't going
to use them any longer.  After we fired  them, they still had a couple of
shows in production and those shows were  a lot better.  I guess they had
never been fired from a series before." When Director Boyd Kirkland was
handed the script, he was not fond of the  story.  "It was not an episode
that I was excited about initially.  Part  of what we were struggling with on
the writing level, whether we were going  to have stories that were
politically correct with social messages hidden  in them, like this one
against cruelty to animals.  But half the fun is to  take the challenge to
make it exciting, andactually, the show came out  okay, a lot of the
sequences are pretty fun."

"The end of a perfect day."  -Batman after the Batcycle is crushed by an
oncoming train, chasing She-Bat

TERROR IN THE SKY *** 11/9/92 (#45)  Story by Steve Perry and Mark Saraceni.
Teleplay by Mark  Saraceni.  Directed by Boyd Kirkland.  Animation by Dong
Yang.

A giant bat creature is once again flying through Gotham, and Batman
confronts Kirk Langstrom, who was the Man-Bat.  Kirk protests his  innocence
and we discover that it is actually his wife Francine, who  accidentally
received a dose of the Man-Bat formular from one of her  father's
experiments.  Batman's pursuit of She-Bat is stunning, and  really makes this
a must-see show.  "It's one of the most amazing set  pieces in the entire
series," said Producer Timm.  "The board artist  for that sequence was Phil
Norwood who does a lot of live-actions  storyboards (TERMINATOR 2, etc.) He's
really great, and he knows the  limits of animation."  Another memorable
sequence is the ending where  She-Bat breaks out of a commercial airliner and
Batman chases her down  to the top of one of Gotham's bridges in the Batwing.
"The last act  was boarded by a guy named Yi-Chi Chen," said Timm.  "He has
really  dynamic sensibilities as far as camera direction, and his staging is
really good."  The sequence was added to because the show came out short  and
director Boyd Kirkland had to add a scene where a stewardess is  sucked out
of the plane.  "Sidney Iwanter, the show's liaison with Fox,  turned down an
earlier script as 'too dark and ugly for a cartoon,'"  noted Timm.  "Kirk and
Francine were on the verge of divorce because  of what he did as the Man-Bat.
She couldn't live with him any more.   In the end they are all in the
Batcave, and she bites Kirk injecting  him with the mutagen.  He becomes the
Man-Bat again.  The two end up  fighting each other and fall into the abyss,
killing each other."

"Sometimes, old friend, I wonder if I'm doing any good out there."

I AM THE NIGHT ***** 11/10/92 (#49)  Story and teleplay by Michael Reaves.
Directed by Boyd  Kirkland.  Animation by Sunrise.

A weary Batman makes his annual visit to his parent's murder sight, and stops
two criminals from beating up a con man.  Late for a rendezvous  on a police
stakeout, Commissioner Gordon is shot in a firefight with  the Jazzman as a
result.  The show climaxes in Gordon's hospital room.  Story editor Michael
Reaves' antidote for the "sanctimonious overgrown  boy scout" image he felt
pervaded the first few episodes of the series.   "I wanted Batman to be this
grim, silent, driven avenger.  I wanted to  do a real stark, '50s-style crime
drama, like NAKED CITY, an adult story.   And I didn't want one of the
Rogue's Gallery to take the limelight away  from Batman. "Initially, we
wanted to have Robin shot and that makes  Batman question his whole purpose,
but BS&P said no, I was surprised  they said we could shoot Gordon.  We
couldn't show him getting shot,  but that made it more dramatic." Director
Boyd Kirkland embraced the  show's storyline, giving him a chance to do
something he wanted to do  with Batman.  "I like to get inside the characters
and see what makes  them tick. Here we show Batman's self doubts, which bring
him to a point  where everybody can relate to him. I like that." He liked it
so much  that he took extra time to work with Reaves, revising several
sequences  in the storyboard stage.  The show-stopper is a slow-motion
sequence  where Batman stops Jazzman's assassination attempt with a quick
batarang  throw.  The scene is helped immeasurably by sound effects, stilled
just  at the moment of the throw.  "It's really dreamlike at that moment,"
noted  producer Bruce Timm.  "It's just the type of weird thing you don't see
in other cartoons."  

"Look on the bright side.  Tomorrow, you'll be feeding hundreds of hungry
cats."  -Harley Quinn, about to roll Catwoman into a cat food meat grinder

ALMOST GOT 'IM ***** 11/11/92  (#46)  Story and teleplay by Paul Dini.
Directed by Eric  Radomski.  Animation by Spectrum/Dong Yang.

The Rogue's Gallery has gathered for a poker game, and to tell tales of  how
they almost killed Batman.  Tales by Poison Ivy, Two-face, Penguin and  Joker
end with Batman trying to save Catwoman from Harley Quinn's cat-food  meat
grinder.  A perfect homage to all those great supervillain death traps
prevalent in the early Batman comics and the '60s TV show.  Beautiful
animation by Spectrum/Dong Yang and the staging by director Eric Radomski  is
magnificent.  Author Paul Dini loved working with director Radomski.   "He
did a terrific job on changing the sequence of the villains' stories  from my
script so the action would build, with each story more elaborate  than the
other until the Joker's segment, which nothing can top.  It's great  and
allows the wrap-up with Harley Quinn and Catwoman to be this nice funny
release.  "It was a blessed episode, easy for me to write and fun to do,  You
need some sort of laughs and humor in a series like this, to offset the
grimness of the show.  You want to play the grim moments as grim and the  sad
moments as sad.  Those occasional funny moments are a release."  

"I just had a disturbing thought.  What if that guy wasn't wearing a mask?"
-Batman to Gordon

MOON OF THE WOLF * 11/12/92 (#42)  Story and teleplay by Len Wein.  Directed
by Dick Sebast.   Animation by AKOM.

A werewolf is terrorizing Gotham and the evil Dr. Milo is the cause.  His
experimental steroid' formula changes athlete Tony Romulus into the creature
of the night.  Nothing but a slugfest between Batman and a werewolf, intercut
with transformation scenes, and a warning for kids to stay away from
steroids.  Noted producer Bruce Timm, "This is what I call a good Tuesday
episode.  It's not what you want to open a week on or end a week on, but it
passes the time agreeably."  To jazz up the show, Timm suggested a guitar
score to composer Richard Bronskill.  "My first thought was that a really
weird electric guitar solo like Eric Clapton's might give it a weird edge,"
said Timm.  "I don't know if it made the show any better, but it's
different." 

"Even scum spend the holidays with their families." -Robin to Batman

CHRISTMAS WITH THE JOKER *** 11/13/92 (#2)  Story and teleplay by Eddie
Gorodetsky.  Directed by Kent  Butterworth.  Animation by AKOM.

It's Christmas, and the Joker has broken out of Arkham Asylum to put on a
murderous holiday television marathon endangering Commissioner Gordon, Harvey
Bullock, and Summer Gleeson.  His explanation?  He didn't have a family of
his own to share Christmas with, so he decided to steal one. Noted producer
Bruce Timm, "It's one of our weirdest shows.  The original  director Kent
Butterworth quit and went to Universal in the middle of  production. Eric
Radomski pretty much redirected it through the layout  stage, making it
tighter."  BS&P refused to approve the original script.   "It started out as
a much nastier, really funny script, written by a  friend of Paul Dini, Eddie
Gorodetsky," said Timm.  "When Joker says  'I didn't have a family of my own,
so I decided to steal one,' it's a  regular family he's stolen, making it
more intense and scary.  "I like  the fact that Fox always runs it on
Christmas, every year," said Timm.   "It's really different than a typical,
sappy Christmas episode on other  series.  It's dark, bitter and weird."

"I wish you wouldn't be so rough with your toys, Master Bruce." -Alfred

HEART OF STEEL (PART 1) **** 11/16/92 (#37)  Story and teleplay by Brynne
Stephens.  Directed by Kevin  Altieri.  Animation by Sunrise.

A robot is caught trying to rob Wayne Enterprises, almost killing Batman  in
the process.  The clues lead Batman as Bruce Wayne to Karl Rossum, who  has
created an artificial intelligence computer named HARDAC.  Wayne meets
Marilyn Monroe look-alike Randa Duane, Rossum's assistant, who acts as
HARDAC's agent in Gotham, replacing city officials with life-like robot
doubles to protect humans from themselves.  Duane, actually a robot,  turns
out to be a formidable foe for Batman thanks to scripter Brynne  Stephens.
Producer Bruce Timm noted he wasn't happy with the score for  the show.  "We
told the composer (Peter Tomashek) the whole show was an  homage to '50s
science fiction movies.  Unfortionately, they made it too  bombastic and took
it way over the top."

HEART OF STEEL (PART 2) **** 11/17/92 (#38) Story and teleplay by Brynne
Stephens.  Directed by Kevin  Altieri.  Animation by Sunrise.

HARDAC has replaced Gordon, Mayor Hill and Harvey Bullock.  When Barbara
Gordon calls Batman to police headquarters with the Batsignal, Bullock's
double and Batmnan have a tremendous battle and the robot gets dropped  into
the Batsignal with spectacular results.  When Batman won't allow  Barbara
Gordon to go with him to HARDAC's lair, she goes on her own.   Animation by
Sunrise is a knockout on both episodes.  Scripter Brynne  Stephens fleshes
out Barbara Gordon to set up her Batgirl debut in  "Shadow of the Bat." Noted
producer Bruce Timm "(Director) Kevin (Altieri)  encouraged the board artists
to go off the script to 'do something  different with it and make it better.'
Every single robot in the show  had a huge fight scene with Batman boarded.
Originally the Bullock robot  sequence went on and on.  The board artist Mark
Wallace did a great job  on it, but we had to cut it all out. That happened
with every single  robot.  Everyone went nuts."  Even a fight between Batman
and his robot  double was cut.  "It was wonderful, great stuff," said Timm.
"But the  show was literally an hour and a half."  That boarded scene became
the  genesis of "His Silicon Soul."  

IF YOU'RE SO SMART WHY AREN'T YOU RICH? *** 11/18/92 (#39)  Story and
teleplay by David Wise.  Directed by Eric Radomski.   Animation by Blue
Pencil (La Paz Azul.)

The origin of the Riddler.  A brilliant game designer, E. Nygma, gets cheated
out of millions of dollars by the company he works for.  He  decides to take
revenge on his boss and adopts the identity of the  Riddler.  When Batman and
Robin close in, he traps them in the Minotaur  Maze, a full-scale version of
his computer game.  Fortunately for the Dynamic Duo, Robin had been an avid
player of the game, for years.   Unfortunately, he had never won it.  In this
show's version of the  classic villain, The Riddler's riddles and death traps
take form long  before he ever dons a costume and turns to crime.  Producer
Bruce Timm  dislikes the character in any form.  "He's super-intelligent, but
he  still has to pull these stupid riddles," said Timm.  "That's the inherent
problem with the Riddler.  That's why he doesn't show up  until late in the
sesason, because nobody could figure out how to make the Riddler work, and
they still didn't figure out how to make  him work."  Producer Eric Radomski,
who directed the show is less  critical, except about its title. "I fought to
get that changed and  no one would change it."  He agrees with Timm that
"It's not one of  the stellar performances of the Batman series."

"Why...it's an homage to me.  Kind of sorry I have to blow it up."   -Joker,
upon seeing the 'Joker's Wild' casino

JOKER'S WILD **11/19/92 (#40)  Story and teleplay by Paul Dini.   Directed by
Boyd Kirkland.  Animation by AKOM.

While watching television in Arkham, the Joker learns that Cameron Kaiser has
opened a casino called Joker's Wild, that's based on the villain's  look.
Enraged, he breaks out of Arkham.  Batman can't believe anyone  would be
stupid enough to risk his casino in such a manner and investigates  Kaiser's
records discovering the casino is massively in debt, and the  insurance
policies are paid in full.  Kaiser is betting the Joker will  arrive and
destroy the casino.  When he does, Batman lets the villain  know he's been
played for a patsy and the Joker goes after Kaiser.  A  cool little episode
with plot twist after plot twist marred only by the  Joker's simple escape
from Arkham, where doors don't lock.  "It's the  kind of thing I wish I had
caught at the storyboard stage," said producer  Bruce Timm.  "You can't have
them reanimate the scene just because it's  dumb."  Director Boyd Kirkland
made special note of Phil Norwood's boards  of Bruce Wayne meeting the Joker
at the blackjack table.  "Wayne is  goadging him and the Joker is doing all
of these elaborate card tricks." At the end, as Kaiser escapes in a
helicopter, he turns to the pilot only  to discover it's the Joker, pointing
a .45 automatic directly at him,  something you don't see anywhere else in
the series.  "By the time, we  had had gotten to that show, the network was
letting us do that sort of  thing," said Kirkland.  "The first episode I did
we couldn't even show a  handgun.  We probably got away with it because of
that stupid Joker face  on the end."

HIS SILICON SOUL ** 11/20/92/ (#60) Story and teleplay by Marty Isenberg and
Robert Skir.   Directed by Boyd Kirkland.  Animation by Spectrum/Dong Yang.

HARDAC's secret Batman robot activates and breaks out of storage.  He  tries
to replace Batman and the hero has to battle his doppleganger,  in order to
save himself and the world.  A very unnecessary sequel to  "Heart of Steel."
While Boyd Kirkland storyboards a great moody  beginning and directs some
fine poignant moments with the robot  realizing he is just a duplicate of
Batman, he can't save a weak,  uninteresting script.  The narrative hook
depends on the overworn  cliche of the artificial man who wants to be human
achieving humanity  by sacrificing himself.  "For me it was making it work on
the level  of the mood I was trying to create, and also create a little
empathy  for the robot character," said Kirkland.  "You need to care about
the  guy who makes the sacrifice at the end of the show.  I thought it was
kind of cool to see Batman fighting Batman."

"What happened to my mask?" -Batman to Talia

OFF BALANCE *** 11/2/92 (#50)  Story and teleplay by Len Wein.  Directed by
Kevin Altieri.   Animation by Sunrise.

An informant tells Batman that the Society of Shadows is planning to steal  a
top-secret sonic weapon.  Later, Count Vertigo and members of the Society use
a vertigo-inducing device to take the weapon from armed guards.  Batman
attempts to recover it and meets up with Talia, a mysterious woman trying  to
get the self-same weapon for her father, Count Vertigo's previous  employer.
The two battle their way through Vertigo's booby-trapped fortress  outside of
Gotham City.  Of course, as befits the villain's name, he final confrontation
takes place in a bell tower a la Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO. The show's final
sequence introduces Ra's Al Ghul.  A setup for the two- parter "The Demon's
Quest."  This episode explains how Talia falls in  love with Batman and
learns his secret identity.  Luckily, it is more  than that, with a solid
storyline and fast-paced action.  Watch for  Twitch, the snitch at the
beginning of the show who gets thrown off  Gotham's Statue of Liberty [I
believe it's the statue of Equality, can  anyone confirm that? -JW] for
revealing the society's plan to Batman.   If you look closely, you'll notice
a passing resemblance to Tim Burton,  passing because the character was
animated off-model.  Three different  versions of the episode aired, as the
show got repeated in the rotation.   "The distortion vertigo sequences
weren't disorienting enough so we did retakes," said producer Bruce Timm of
Sunrise's animation.  "While we  were waiting for them, we did effects in
video with a computer that were  real wobbly and quite nauseating.  It worked
great, but, we did that to  just get the show on the air.  When we got the
retakes back, the film  editors cut them into the episode, but dropped the
video distortion effects  on the whole sequence and that ran.  We told them
to put the effects back  in, which is the version now airing.

"Looks like Edward Nygma is making a comeback."  -Batman to Gordon

WHAT IS REALITY? *** 11/24/92 (#48) Story and teleplay by Marty Isenberg ad
Robert N. Skir.   Directed by Dick Sebast. Animation by AKOM.

The Riddler is "hacking" his way thorugh Gotham's automated teller system and
the stock exchange, "deleting" his former personality, E. Nygma from  all
computerized records.  To get revenge on Batman, he lures Commissioner Gordon
into a deadly virtual reality program with no exit and Batman must battle the
Riddler inside the virtual reality landscape to save his friend. Batman's
first cyberpunk adventure and despite a rather hackneyed plot  with a
tremendously contrived "funny" escape solution, it's surprisingly
entertaining with some good-looking animation.  Producer Bruce Timm was  not
a fan of the episode.  "Virtual reality is too science fictiony for  our
show," he said.  "While it may be conceivable that it will work in  four or
five years, Batman transforming himself into a black knight and  flying
around on a chessboard is unfathomable to me.  Strangely enough,  it's one of
AKOM's better shows.  They pulled off all the special effects  really well."

"C'mon, he was a demented, abusive, psychotic maniac."  -Harvey Bullock,  on
the Joker's demise

THE LAUGHING FISH ***1/2 1/10/93 (#33) Story and teleplay by Paul Dini.
Directed by Bruce W. Timm.   Animation by Dong Yang.

The Joker has contaminated all the fish in Gotham with a chemical that  makes
them smile like his own face.  In a typically insane twist, he  goes down to
the patent office and demands a patent on the fish so he  may get royaties
from every Joker-fish sold.  When he's refused, the  Joker proceeds dispose
of patent officers until Batman gracks him to  his hideout at the city's
Aquarium.  A nice adaptation of two Joker  comic book stories ("The Joker's
Three-Way Revenge" by Adams and O'Neil  ["The Joker's Five-Way Revenge"
pointed out by Alec Ersnatch -JW] and  "The Laughing Fish" by Englehart and
Rogers).  Director/producer Bruce  Timm played special attention to this
episode.  "I wanted the Joker to  be very scary in this show and scripter
Paul Dini came through," said  Timm.  "The Joker is actually threatening.
Obviously, we couldn't kill  people, but his victims might as well be dead.
We put them into comas  with this horrible grin on their face.  It's one of
Paul's best scripts, " Timm not only influenced the story, he also shaped the
episode on the  boards, storyboarding the entire third act himself and most
of the rest.   Timm also pushed the scariness of the episode during the
scoring by  Shirley Walker.  "When we were spotting the show, I told Shirley
I didn't  want the Joker theme in it.  I wanted it to sound like a horror
movie.   Not like an over-the-top melodramatic Universal horror movie,
because most  of our scores are already over-the-top, but I wanted it to
sound like  ALIEN.  She didn't think a cartoon could support that type of
score, but  I convinced her that we had room to experiment in 65 episodes.
It's the  weirdest score of any of the shows, with this strange dissident
music  behind the Joker that builds a weird tension you're not conciously
aware  of.  The first two acts have only this very straight demonic music and
I  think it helps the show immeasurably.  Without it, it would just have been
another show."

"I'm not a doormat.  Am I?" -Harley "If you had a middle name it would be
Welcome." -Ivy

HARLEY AND IVY ***** 1/18/93 (#56)  Story and Teleplay by Paul Dini. Directed
by Boyd  Kirkland.  Animation by TMS/Dong Yang.  

Harley Quinn is kicked out of the Joker's gang and decides to go it on  her
own.  In the course of her first solo robbery, she's thrown together  with
Poison Ivy who is robbing the same museum.  The two team up and have  a
hugely successful crime spree at Gotham's expense.  The women finally  have
to contend with both Batman and the Joker, but prove that no man is  a match
for them.  Author Paul Dini explained how this episode started.   "I stuck my
head in (producer) Alan Burnett's office one day and said I  wanted to do
THELMA & LOUSISE with Harley and Ivy.  He said, 'I like it!'   I thought the
two of them would make an interesting pair.  You have  Harley who is an
'enabler' who lets the Joker do awful things to the  world as well as to her.
And you have Ivy who takes no crap whatsoever,  least of all from a man."
"Originally, Harley was only supposed to be  in one episode, but she was very
appealing and she added this other  dimension to the Joker; most of his
henchpeople are pretty expendable.   After Bruce (Timm) and I had done a
couple of shows with Harley, we began  thinking, what if she's really kind of
stuck on him and that's part of the  relationship.  She's in love with him
and he treats her like a pet.   Harley, in her own warped way wants to marry
the guy, settle down and have  this nice little family life.  But he'll never
give her that because he  knows by not giving it to her, he's torturing her
in a meaner way than if  he actually just shot her.  Someday he'll probably
get around to that too.   But this episode is a lighthearted romp with two
psychotic women in costume." Noted director Boyd Kirkland, "I don't know how
we got away with the episode,  because the whole underlying subtext of this
show is this abusive  relationship between the Joker and Harley.  She just
keeps coming back  for more.  The layouts were done at TMS, and I think they
did a wonderful  job on the girls.  Of all the episodes featuring the girls,
this is the  best looking.  They were on model."  Kirkland added one scene to
the  script.  "The girls are tooling around town and they pull up at the
intersection next to the cat with the guys who are hooting and hollering  at
them and such.  Harley pulls out her bazooka and blows up their car.   My
wife laughed her head off at that sequence.  It's what every woman  would
love to do."  Noted scripter Paul Dini, "We wanted this as our  first prime
time show, and Fox was going to run it.  Then a Fox executive  saw it and
said 'What the hell is this?  Batman's not in this episode.   He's only in it
at the end?  The whole episode is two girls running around in  their
underwear.  There's no boy appeal here.'  I said, 'Well maybe not  any boys
you know.'  They refused to run it in prime-time.  Their idea  of a perfect
show is 'I Am the Night.'  That meets their criteria.  It's  dark and grim,
with more of an adult feel and Robin was in it." 

"What happened?  You been letting the kid drive again?" -Earl to Batman  and
Robin, in the wrecked Batmobile

THE MECHANIC *** 1/24/93 (#55)  Story by Steve Perry and Laren Bright.
Teleplay by Randy  Rogel.  Directed by Kevin Altieri.  Animation by AKOM.

Batman's car is wrecked and he takes it to his secret mechanic, Earl  Cooper.
Penguin discovers Cooper and forces him to sabotage the  Batmobile in order
to protect his daughter's life, leaving Batman and  Robin at the mercy of the
Penguin.  A long take on something that didn't  work that well in BATMAN
RETURNS.  If it wasn't for director Kevin  Altieri's staging of the action
sequences, this would have been a bore.   "This was one of those stories in
development hell for a long time," said  producer Bruce Timm.  "We needed
scripts.  I think it's a stinker, but it  has some of AKOM's better animation
in it."  Noted director Kevin Altieri,  "It was the first show that AKOM laid
out itself.  It's not as good as  their 'The Last Laugh,' but had far fewer
retakes (almost 80% of 'The  Last Laugh'needed retakes.)  I think they were
threatened that they might  lose the work, so they put their A-Team on it.
"It actually is a script  that is similar to the '60s series," said Altieri.
"But when you do do  something like this comedy, you must remember that even
thought the script may be goofy, you have to show that the characters are
living it.  When  Earl drops the tires on Penguin's henchmen, he thinks
Batman's dead and  he's crying."

THE MAN WHO KILLED BATMAN **** 2/1/93 (#51)  Story and teleplay by Paul Dini.
Directed by Bruce Timm.   Animation by Sunrise.

Told in flashback, we discover that Sid, one of Boss Thorne's stooges thinks
he's killed Batman, and so do his accomplices.  He's kidnapped  by the Joker
who drops Sid into a vat of acid with Harley Quinn playing  'Amazing Grace'
in the background.  Miraculously, Sid survives, and goes  to his boss, Rupert
Thorne, for protection from all the crooks who want  to kill Batman's killer.
This is one of those stories that typifies  scripter Paul Dini's Lone Ranger
version of Batman:  the hero who only  comes in at the end and rides away
when everything is solved.  "The idea  of Batman, and what he means to the
city, is stronger when he's not  around," said Dini. "It's a Will
Eisner-style story."  Eisner created  the seminal masked hero, The Spirit,
back in the '30s.  "Batman's presence  is felt all the way through it. That's
what I love about the series.   The idea of Batman is so strong that he
doesn't even have to be in the  episode.  It's his aura that propels the
series.  Most of my episodes  don't deal with Batman, but with the villains."
As for Harley Quinn  playing "Amazing Grace" on the kazoo-  "We thought we
would get in  trouble, that people would say it was sacrilegious," noted
Dini.  "But  it was really funny.  I gave (actress) Arleen (Sorkin) a kazoo
and she  did it in one take, which was lucky because we were all screaming
with  laughter when she did it.  We never would have gotten another take out
of her."  Noted producer Bruce Timm of Mark Hamill's voice  characterization
of the Joker, eulogizing Batman, "That is one of the  sequences, where Mark
did such a great job vocally, that when I was  boarding it, all I had to do
was listend to what he was doing with his  voice and pictures just popped
into my head.  It just happens like that  sometimes.  One of the things we
wanted to do a lot more of in this  series with the Joker was to have him do
these great,violent mood swings." Timm praised Sunrise Animation's handling
of the Joker.  "A lot of the  studios interpret the shadows around his eyes
like a mask, almost a  raccoon mask.  Fortunately,Sunrise didn't.  I have to
give Ronnie del  Carmen credit, they followed his storyboards dead on.There
are a lot of  these great Joker expressions on the board that actually make
it into the  cartoon."

"I was a different person then." -Bruce "Yes, intense, driven, moody.  She'd
never recognize you now." -Alfred

ZATANNA *** 2/2/93 (#54)  Story and teleplay by Paul Dini.  Directed by Dick
Sebast.   Animation by Spectrum/ Dong Yang.

A fun script drives this story about Zatanna, a magician who gets framed  for
robbing the Gotham mint during her stage act.  Batman had met her  years
earlier, while training to be the world's best crimefighter.  At  the time,
he was using a false identity to study under the greatest stage magician and
escape artist of all time, Zatara.  His cute young daughter,  Zatanna, had a
crush on "Joe Smith" ["John Smith" -JW] and then he  disappeared from her
life.  Director Dick Sebast's last show.  Sebast  quit in the middle of it
and it was finished by uncredited Dan Riba.  This wonderful little episode is
designed to delight DC comics fans by  tying Batman's training to one of DC's
Golden-Age heroes.  But even if  you don't know the history of the
characters, the show comes off as a  nice, light romp.  Noted scripter Paul
Dini, "Bruce had to learn to be  an escape artist from someone, and I thoguht
wouldn't it be great if he  learned from Zatara, DC's old Golden Age hero,
who at the time had a cute  little sixteen-year old daughter.  I pitched it
to Paul Levitz, president  of DC Comics, who said, 'That's wonderful.  That's
better than anything  we've ever done with Zatanna!'  And it was logical that
if he learned from  her father, he would have had a little thing going with
Zatanna."  Dini  wrote the part with voice actress Julie Brown in mind.


"All right, scumbucket.  It's you, me and thirty stories.  You're going  to
tell me exactly what I want to know." -Batman to a dangling saboteur

ROBIN'S RECKONING (PART 1) ***** 2/7/93 (#32)  Story and teleplay by Randy
Rogel.  Directed by Dick Sebast.   Animation by Spectrum.

While foiling saboteurs at a construction site, Batman learns that the  man
who killed Robin's parents, Tony Zucco, is back in town.  He goes  off to
track him down and tells Robin to stay at home.  Robin tries to  discover why
Batman is being so mysterious, and finds out who his guardian  is hunting.
Angry at Batman for keeping him out of the chase, Robin rides  off into the
night.  This Emmy award-winning episode is magnificent, with  a fresh and
emotionally charged retelling of Robin's origin with the young  hero's
dialogue being extremely well-written by Randy Rogel.  The animation  by
Spectrum is beautifully done, with a weight and depth seldom seen on
television.  Particularly strong is the action as Batman infiltrates a
mobster's estate, silently taking out guards and cutting through alarms.
Noted producer Bruce Timm, "It's a stunning sequence, made all the more
effective by the fact that it is done without any music, only sound effects.
That's the first time we did an action sequence without any music behind it.
We were spotting the episode with (musical director) Shirley Walker, and  she
said 'This stuff is so strong you don't need music.'  I said 'You're
kidding!'  It was all her idea, and she was right.  For some reason, it makes
it seem very real.  It gave it an extra dimension that we don't  usually
have."  Timm noted how the emotions in the episode made people  cry.  "Dan
Riba, who was a storyboard artist at the time, was crying in  the editing
room when Robin says goodbye to his circus friends and the  elephant after
his parents' depths.  I cried when I heard the score added  to the scene by
Carlos Rodriguez.  The combination of the music and the  visuals was just so
moving, I started weeping."

BIRDS OF A FEATHER *** 2/8/93 (#47)  Story by Chuck Menville.  Teleplay by
Brynne Stephens.   Directed by Frank Paur.  Animation by Dong Yang.

The Penguin is in love, but not for long.  Veronica Vreeland wants a  super
villain as the attraction at her next party so she invites the  Penguin.  He
jumps at this chance to enter high society, and flattered  by Vreeland's
attention, he falls for her.  At the party the Penguin  discovers Vreeland's
motives and kidnaps her.  Until this episode, the  Penguin has been shown as
a belligerent, self-centered, arrogant,pompous  ass.  Her we see what all
that has gotten him in life.  When he leaves  the jail, no-one comes to meet
him.  He must ride a bus home.  When he  gets there, Batman has already
broken in, and warns the Penguin to stay  on the straight and narrow path.
Noted director Frank Paur, "Batman comes  out as a putz in this show with his
actions proving to be as much the  problem as the solution."  Producer Bruce
Timm credited storyboard artist  Ronnie Del Carmen with the show's affecting
characterizations.  "He is  the star of the show," said Timm.  "Ronnie put a
lot of time and effort  into acting out the storyboard poses.  He's the one
that made that episode  special.  All the acting bits that the Penguin does
throughout are due to  Ronnie.  He thought all of that out."

"You're a real piece of work Batman." -Robin

ROBIN'S RECKONING (PART 2) ***1/2 2/14/93 (#37) [Thanks to hphri@chevron.com
for pointing out that both this  and Heart of Steel Part 1 are listed as #37.
If anyone knows the REAL  episode number, please tell me. -JW.] Story and
teleplay by Randy Rogel.   Directed by Dick Sebast.  Animation by
Spectrum/Dong Yang.

Batman finds Zucco in a building near an abandoned amusement park.  Zucco  is
so paranoid, that he's actually alert enough to wing Batman, chasing  him
through the park.  Flashbacks show young Dick Grayson's chase of Tony  Zucco
in the past that leads Bruce Wayne to adopt the boy and train him as  Robin.
Dong Yang's animation is flat and cartoon-like from Spectrum's  layouts.
"When the second episode came in it was a crushing blow," said  producer
Bruce Timm.  "I always knew it was going to be a problem because  of the
overly-complicated merry-go-round sequence, but it was more than  just that
one sequence.  It could have been great.  It should have been  better,
because the boards were better.  Spectrum fell down on this one,  because
they did the layouts for the show."  Though flashbacks give us a  great
background on Wayne and Grayson, and allows us a cool look at  Batman's first
costume, the story adds little to the emotional impact of  the first episode.
"The story wasn't quite as compelling as the first  part," said Timm.  "It
just spends its time tying up loose ends."

"I still have serious misgivings about building weapons systems."  -Bruce
Wayne, just before Penguin steals the stealth helicopter his company
developed.

BLIND AS A BAT *** 2/22/93 (#58) Story by Mike Underwood and Len Wein.
Teleplay by Len Wein.   Directed by Dick Sebast and Dan Riba.  Animation by
Junio.

The Penguin steals Wayne Enterprises' latest invention, a deadly assault
helicopter with a special optical system for perfect targeting day or  night.
During the theft, Bruce Wayne is temporarily blinded.  Feeling  responsible
for the havoc the Penguin wreaks with the copter, Batman  takes a daring
chance and has a helmet version of the new optical  system connected directly
to his optic nerves.  The Penguin takes on  a certain menace in this episode,
mainly because the interplay back  and forth between the hero and the villain
finally seems equal.  With  the helicopter at his disposal, he actually has
something that puts him  on somewhat equal fighting terms with Batman, as
opposed to 'Birds of  A Feather' or 'I Have Batman in My Basement' ['I've Got
Batman in My  Basement'-JW]  where the Fowl Fiend seems totally outclassed by
Batman. This is the first episode totally directed by Dan Riba (who had been
a  director at DIC.)  He spent a lot of time going over the layouts and it
shows.  The action is well timed and smooth, moving the episode along at  a
good pace.  "Everybody was worried about the mechanics of the third  act and
how to make it work and we kind of lost track of what the  characters'
motivations were, myself included.  Suddenly, I realized we  had turned Wayne
into an arms merchant, which he shouldn't be.  He  doesn't like guns.  He
would never manufacture guns.  "There was a line  in the script where he
gloats about how much money he would make on the  sale of this copter.  We
altered that to him expressing his reservations  about the sale.  At the ADR
(looping) session, (producer) Alan Burnett  wrote a new line for a voice over
expressing his regret at building the  thing in the first place.  We implied
that not only had be been blind  physically, but he had been blind to what
his company was doing." In the script the copter was supposed to have been
for police riot  control.  After the LA riots, it was changed quickly to the
military.

"You cannot hide a warrior's spirit behind your playboy image, Wayne-san."
-Yoru Sensai to Bruce

DAY OF THE SAMURAI **** 2/23/93 (#43) Story and teleplay by Steve Perry.
Directed by Bruce Timm.   Animation by Blue Pencil, SI (La Paz Azul).

Bruce Wayne gets called to Japan by the sensei who taught him martial  arts.
Kyodai Ken is holding a prize pupil ransom for the secret of the  Death
Touch.  Once he learns the secret, Batman and the ninja must battle  to the
death while a volcano explodes around them.  One of the best  episodes in the
series.  The score is a perfect mood setter.  The  direction and staging of
the action are well done, with a highly  ambitious use of subtitles in major
segments of the show.  The larger  than life characters play against a mythic
backdrop, with very real and  dangerous heroics.  Director/producer Bruce
Timm was reluctant to stage  the final act as described in the script.  It
called for Batman to face  off against Kyodai Ken unmasked.  "I really have a
thing about showing  Batman in costume with his mask pulled down," said Timm.
"I've always  hated that in the comics.  I don't mind knowing it's Bruce
Wayne as  Batman.  But to see him half-and-half like that just makes him a
guy  in a suit.  With the mask on he has this mythic quality.  (Story editor)
Michael Reaves figured out a way that he absolutely had to have his mask
pulled down during the final fight.  It just bugged me that I was that  guy
who had to direct that show! Not only that, I had to board that  sequence."
La Paz Azul Animation went broke in the middle of production.   "You can see
the scene where it happens," said Timm.  "They're in the  volcano and bang:
'Oh my g d, they ran out of money!  This is garbage.'  I couldn't bear to
watch it, my heart was broken."  Jade Animation was  hired to do retakes,
which saved the show.  Timm also credited the authentic Japanese score by
Carlos Rodriguez.  Noted Timm with some pride,  "We kill the villain. Michael
Reaves and I were very careful about  setting it up from the script to the
boards.  We had to give him a  getaway, just to get it past BS&P. There's a
rock behind him, he could  have jumped to.  But he's not going to run away.
He's committing seppuku."

"See you around, Batman, too bad you can't say the same."  -Lloyd Ventris,
the Invisible Man

SEE NO EVIL *** 2/24/93 (#15)  Story and teleplay by Martin Pasko.  Directed
by Dan Riba.   Animation by Spectrum/Dong Yang. 	 Lloyd Ventris, a petty
thief, visits the daughter he's separated from by  using a costume made of
invisible material he stole.  He learns that  his ex-wife is planning to
leave town, and starts on a crime spree to  get enough money to steal his
little girl.  Batman tries to stop the  crime spree and the kidnapping.  A
scary episode with an ever more  psychotic daddy pretending he's his
daughter's invisible friend.  Noted Timm, "An invisible man works really well
in animation, even better  than it does in live action.  we have total
control over the scene.  We  can do things that would take zillions of
dollars to do in live action." Timm recalled that the script by Martin Pasko
was toned down by BS&P.   "We were never allowed to put the little girl in
any jeopardy.   Originally, the climax was supposed to be at a lighthouse and
the suit,  instead of being just poisonous, was going to explode from
repeated use.   Ventris was going to be hiding in this lighthouse with his
daughter.   Batman would have had to race against time to get them.  But we
were not  allowed to do that.  That's why she escapes immediately.'
Originally  this production number was assigned to an episode entitled 'The
Count  and the Countess.'  Producer Timm sent it to a Japansese studio for
complete preproduction work as an experiment.  He thought it would free  up
the in-house staff's time for better shows.  The overseas studio took  months
to produce even character designs and a partial storyboard, and  those were
drawn in a style too off-model to be useable.  Production on  the first
season was nearing an end and with a troubled script and  unacceptable
preproduction work, the episode was killed.  When "See No  Evil" was
completed (the 57th or 58th show finished), it was assigned  the lower
production number left empty.

THE DEMON'S QUEST (PART 1) ***** 5/3/93 (#59)  Story and teleplay by Dennis
O'Neill.  Director Kevin Altieri.   Animation by TMS/ Dong Yang.

Robin is kidnapped and Bruce Wayne receives a note that reads "Batman.   Come
save Robin."  Batman then meets up with Ra's Al Ghul, whose daughter  Talia
("Off Balance") has also been kidnapped, apparently by the same  people. Ra's
Al Ghul proposes they join forces, and the world-wide hunt  begins. After
Batman frees Robin from his captors and turns down the  offer of Talia as a
bride, Ra's Al Ghul is revealed to be a 600-year-old  man who needs to be
revived by in the waters of the Lazarus Pit.  This  is a faithful adaptation
of Dennis O'Neil's and Neal Adams' now-famous  series of Batman stories from
the mid-seventies, and is the best comic  adaptation to appear in the TV
series which Altieri had lobbied to do  almost from the start. O'Neil wrote
the script for Part 1 and an outline  for Part 2.  The results are
spectacular.  The change of venue from  Gotham City to the streets and
jungles of the outside world doesn't  diminish Batman's character but serves
to strengthen it and Altieri's  staging of the action is superb.

"He's going to realize his dream of a green and balanced Earth at any cost.
Even if it means laying waste to half the planet to do it." -Batman about
Ra's Al Ghul

THE DEMON'S QUEST (PART 2) **** 5/4/93 (#63) Story by Dennis O'Neil and Len
Wein.  Teleplay by Len Wein.   Directed by Kevin Altieri.  Animation by
TMS/Dong Yang.

Batman and Robin barely escape certain death after falling into the  Lazarus
Pit. [Almost: they don't actually fall in, if they did they'd  be toast. -JW]
They return to Gotham from the Himalayas [they go to  Wayne Enterprises
Nepal, not Gotham. -JW] and discover Ra's has a  satellite in orbit.  Batman
follows Ra's to his desert stronghold and  when he again refuses to marry
Talia, Ra's tells him of his plan to  create a paradise on Earth by wiping
out two-thirds of the world's  population.  Director Kevin Altieri boarded
much of the show himself.   His climactic sabre duel between Batman and Ra's
is a particular  standout.  "I love sword fights and there are rare
opportunities in animation to do them," said Altieri.  "The imagery from the
Neal Adams  comic always struck me:  Batman stripped to the waist with that
saber,  wearing only the mask and the tights, not the cape or anything else.
I think it is the single greatest image Adams ever contributed to the
character."

"You've got a hard head. How about using it for something other than a  blunt
object." -Batman to Rhino

READ MY LIPS ***** 5/10/93 (#64)  Story by Alan Burnett and Michael Reaves.
Teleplay by  Joe Lansdale.  Directed by Boyd Kirkland.  Animation by TMS/Dong
Yang.

A new mob had come to Gotham City and is robbing it blind, run by  Scarface,
a ventriloquist's dummy, who insists that he's alive and  that the
ventriloquist who's operating him is just a nobody.  Batman  follows the one
criminal he can identify, Rhino, to the gang's hideout.   Playing on the
villain's psychosis, Batman tricks Scarface to turn on  the ventriloquist.
Great direction by Boyd Kirkland combined with  Lansdale's solid script and
good animation by TMS/Dong Yang make this  one of the darkest and most
interesting shows of the series.  Batman's  mindgame with the ventriloquist's
multiple personalities is genuinely  disturbing, and is yet another example
of story editor Michael Reaves'  vision of Batman as a
do-anything-to-stop-the-bad-guy vigilante.  His  choice of Joe Lansdale as
scripter enhanced that vision, as Lansdale  is known as a writer in the Jim
Thompson school of mysteries and suspense. Noted director Boyd Kirkland,
about the shooting "death" of Scarface,  "It really has an impact.  You have
almost come to think of this thing  as alive.  It was one of these sneaky
ways of getting away with  something BS&P would normally never let you get
away with, because it  was just a dummy.  It was very effective and creepy."


"Behold the coming of my brother, Lord Hades." -Maxie Zeus, the first  time
he sees Batman

FIRE FROM OLYMPUS ** 5/24/93 (#62)  Story by Paul Dini.  Teleplay by Judith &
Garfield Reeves- Stevens.  Directed by Dan Riba.  Animation by Spectrum/Dong
Yang.

A giant electronic cannon is stolen from the army, and the culprit is  Maxie
Zeus, a man who dresses and behaves as if he truly is his namesake,  the
Greek god Zeus.  With wealth acquired through smuggling, he has built himself
an Olympus (actually a penthouse) over Gotham.  Batman must stop  him from
destroying Gotham City in his madness.  "We were trying to play  Maxie Zeus
as a looney," noted director Dan Riba.  "With all our other  villains you
follow their slow descent into madness, but when we come to  Maxie, he's just
nuts.  It's the episode most like the old '60s show,  and basically Maxie
functions as our King Tut.  The real story centers  on the people around him
coming to the realization of just how crazy he  is."  This is a weak episode
which Riba at least makes interesting by  cleverly staging the death traps
set by Zeus.  In a neat sequence at the  end, Maxie is dollied through the
corridors of Arkham Asylum, and  recognizes his fellow gods in its confines:
Hermes, the trickster god  (The Joker), Janus the two-faced god (Two-Face),
and Demeter, the goddess  of plants (Poison Ivy).  Riba found it to be an
interesting twist:  "It gives it a mythological sort of importance. Sort of
'Campbellizes'  the whole thing."

"Don't you just love it when he gives them to you gift wrapped." -Gordon
after finding Boss Thorne all trussed up by Batman

SHADOW OF THE BAT (PART 1) **** 9/13/93 (#57)  Story and teleplay by Brynne
Stephens.  Directed by Frank  Paur.  Animation by Dong Yang.

A hotshot new Assistant Police Commissioner is putting the grab on lots  of
criminals and newspaper headlines.  At first, Commissioner Gordon  finds the
situation wonderful until the young man uncovers evidence that  Gordon
himself has been taking bribes from Boss Thorne.  When the  commissioner ends
up in jail, Batman goes undercover, despite Barbara  Gordon's plea that he
appear at a public rally of support for her father.   Barbara finally decides
to impersonate Batman at the rally.  When gunmen  attack the platform,
Batgirl and Robin find themselves in the middle of  a firefight, just when
Batman discovers who from his Rogue's Gallery is  behind it all.  A great
show with a dark, moody opening, and intricate,  surprising plot twists.  As
Batgirl's origin story, Barbara Gordon's  motivation for becoming Batgirl is
much stronger than any other previous  version, and her visual styling and
characterization are wonderful.   Director Frank Paur called this his
favorite episode. 

SHADOW OF THE BAT (PART 2) *** 9/14/93 (#61)  Story and teleplay by Brynne
Stephens.  Directed by Frank  Paur.  Animation by Dong Yang.

Batman, Robin and Batgirl are trapped in an abandoned subway station by
Two-Face.  He blows the tunnel and the Gotham River comes flooding in.
Batgirl is the only one able to escape in time.  She goes off to stop
Two-Face from murdering her dad as Batman and Robin fight the torrent  and
seek safety in a derelict subway car.  Eventually they use the car  to crash
their way to freedom.  There's a final confrontation at the  docks of Gotham.
Great action sequences in a script that fails to match  the quality of Part
1.  The dark atmosphere of the first episode is  lacking.  Noted director
Frank Paur, "I think action-wise we were able  to pull it off, but
reality-wise, I don't think so.  It just wasn't  real plausible.  There was a
lot of stuff that we didn't really like  very much and knew there were going
to be problems.  But we worked with  what we had and made it as entertaining
as we could.  The chase on the  docks and the beginning are fine.  "The whole
second episode comes along  and it didn't live up to the first one.  I would
have preferred less of  things blowing up and more skullduggery going on.  A
lot of our sequels  don't live up to part one.  I don't know why that is.  If
anything they  should be better, and this s actually one of our better ones.
The  animation by Dong Yang, the music and everything just elevates the show
up above a lot of the others." 

MUDSLIDE ***** 9/15/93 (#52)  Story by Alan Burnett.  Teleplay by Steve
Perry.  Directed  by Eric Radomski.  Animation by Junio.

Clayface's body is decomposing and he is stealing materials from laboratories
to supply a doctor who is trying to help.  The doctor was  a fan of Matt
Hagen when he was a film star [I believe she was one of  his medical advisers
on his films. -JW]  and risks all to save her film  heartthrob. Batman tracks
him down and in a climactic battle above tall  cliffs, Clayface falls into
the water and disintegrates.  What is it  about Clayface that makes the guys
on this show do their best work? This  is another triumph for Eric Radomski
who has turned out to be one of  the series' best directors. There's a scene
where Clayface takes Batman  into his body to suffocate him. We see Batman
struggling to get out of  Clayface's mammoth frame.  As he struggles futilely
inside, Clayface starts  to count off Batman's heartbeats as his heart slowly
begins to stop.  The  effect is terrifying.  You find yourself holding your
breath, and Batman's  escape is an awesome release. It's the epitome of what
animation can do  magnificently.  It just couldn't be done in live-action.
The ending is  equally chilling and Clayface literally slips through Batman's
fingers to  fall to the water below and slowly gets dissolved in the waves.
It's  something that story editor Michael Reaves thought they wouldn't be
able  get away with.  "Since Warner Brothers was paying for the series, Fox
could give suggestions, but we didn't have to take them," he said.  "The only
people we had to listen to was Broadcast Standards and Practices and their
only flat-out taboo was that we couldn't kill anybody, and we even  got
around that a couple of times.  In this episode Clayface went off that  cliff
and melted.  He's dead."

"If ever anyone led a worry-free life, it's you, Bruce Wayne." -Veronica
Vreeland

THE WORRY MEN **** 9/16/93 (#65)  Story and teleplay by Paul Dini.  Directed
by Frank Paur.   Animation by Dong Yang.

After a party thrown by Veronica Vreeland, Gotham City's millionaires  start
robbing their own companies of millions.  How does this tie in to  the
mysterious Mayan witch doctor that Batman found stalking the party?   It
probably has something to do with those South American Worry Men dolls  that
Vreeland gave away at her party.  Another wonderful mystery in a  series that
has some doozies.  Once again, the Mad Hatter is brought to  life through the
amazing voice characterization of Roddy McDowall.  The  Hatter gloats over a
captured Batman teeling him every detail of his  brilliant insidous plot that
even snared $20 million from Bruce Wayne.   It was a scene that worried
director Frank Paur "It's about a page and  a half of dialog!  And Roddy
McDowall is just wonderful, if anyone else  had done this it would have been
flat, but just listening to him was  like listening to him was like listening
to music as he was going through  all this stuff."  Paur explains the key to
the Mad Hatter's menace, "He's  probably the villain who hates Batman the
most, because Batman stopped  him from getting the woman he loved.  It's
really personal with him."

PAGING THE CRIME DOCTOR *** 9/17/93 (#53) Story by Mike Barr and Laren
Bright.  Teleplay by Randy Rogel  and Martin Pasko. Directed by Frank Paur.
Animation by Dong Yang.

Boss Thorne has a heart attack [it's a brain tumor -JW], and his brother, the
Crime Doctor of the title, is forced to kidnap Dr. Leslie Thompkins in order
to do the surgery.  Batman becomes involved and shuts down the operation.
Features an opening with the most illogical car heist in history, straining
even the most diehard fan's credulity. The sentimental ending where Bruce
Wayne offers the man help in exchange  for stories about his father actually
is far more touching than it should  be.  "Everybody calls it 'The Geezer
Show,'" said director Frank Paur.   "I had a problem with the part where
these old people are leaping across  the rooftops.  Now, in the model sheets,
Leslie looks like Granny in the  Tweety Bird cartoons, and we have the script
calling for all of these  physical things.  So, I went in to Bruce (Timm) and
asked if we couldn't  redesign the character to make her a little more
sturdy.  But Bruce  believes that once you establish a character, this is the
character you  have to go with.  So what I did was have one of our guys go
through all  the action poses with Leslie so she'd be a little more sturdy.
At least  I got that much past him."  Paur believes that a change of title
might  have changed people's expectations so they wouldn't have been so
disappointed.  "The images that the title conjures up is that there  is this
really, evil, nasty guy who's doing all these weird experiments.   When you
see this nice, portly old gentleman, who's coerced into a life  of crime by
his brother, it's not quite what you're expecting, and the  show goes off in
a direction that's opposite to the title's connotations.   It's really one of
the sentimental shows that the ending makes fit  together."

the Colonies' entire fleet, except for the Battlestar Galactica, captained
by Commander Adama. Adama gathers up the few remaining humans left on all
the twelve worlds and embarks on a journey to find the mythical planet
Earth, the supposed thirteenth colony of Mankind, lost ages ago when humans
first left the motherworld, Kobol. With food and fuel running out, the
fleet heads for an ore planet, Carillon, hoping to get what it needs. The

more notably, the planet Gamoray to begin with. Adama, however, fears that
the Cylons may attack the unprotected fleet while the battlestars are away.
Cain takes steps to assure his plans, and is relieved of duty. The Cylons
do attack the fleet (with 3 Base Stars), and the Pegasus is pulled out to
surprise the Cylons. This works, and the fleet is saved. Then they launch a
surprise attack on Gamoray while the Pegasus takes on the three Base Stars.
The Galactica obtains fuel from Gamoray, but the Pegasus disappears after

The fleet is plagued by a group of glowing lights that constantly fly past
them too fast to be followed. Also, Vipers keep disappearing whenever they
follow the lights. On a mission to find the men, Apollo, Starbuck, and
Sheba find a desolate planet, and the remains of a ship wreck. There they
find Count Iblis, who claims to be, if not a deity, then the next best
thing. His mysterious powers sway the fleet, as he promises to deliver
them if they will follow him. Adama doubts Iblis' word, but gives him the
task of delivering the traitor Baltar, which he does. Everyone is ready to
follow Iblis, but Adama and Apollo soon realize that Iblis is really the
Prince of Darkness and that those 'lights' are after him. In a final
battle, Iblis kills Apollo, then is taken away for killing someone who
hasn't given himself freely. Starbuck and Sheba, while bringing Apollo's
body back, are captured by the lights, who reveal themselves to be the good
version of Iblis' type. They resurrect Apollo, and give the Galacticans

to confirm the story, and the Borellians get on board by joining the Viper

Starbuck, and sets out to find the real killer. With Baltar's help, it is
discovered that Ortega was blackmailing a man who had taken bribes to let
people on board his ship during the exodus from the Colonies. This man
killed Ortega, and is captured when he attempts to kill Baltar, the only
other man who can identify him.

Apollo and Starbuck find a primitive sleeper ship carrying a man, a woman,
and four children. It is taken aboard, and is believed to be from Earth.
The council wants to open the ship, even though it might kill the
inhabitants. Adama will not allow this. Dr. Wilker and Dr. Salik discover
that the inhabitants cannot survive in their atmosphere. Apollo, Starbuck,
and Cassiopea steal the ship, and continue with it to it's destination,
Paradeen. The male, Michael, informs the Galacticans that they are
originally from Terra, but have fled the war with the Eastern Alliance (an
evil government), who are killing the democratic Nationalists. An Eastern
Alliance ship follows the sleeper ship and captures the party. However,
the Galacticans are able to then capture the Alliance men, and take them
back to the fleet in their own ship, and imprison them on the Prison Barge.
The fleet then continues on to Terra, gaining the location from Michael.

Adama is besieged by the troublesome Siress Tinia, who is appointed by the
Council of Twelve to watch over him. Meanwhile, Baltar plans his escape
with the help of the three Borellians and the Alliance Enforcers. Thanks
to the Council's interference, hostages are taken, and Adama is forced to
give in. Baltar is to escape in his fighter, along with his Centaurians,
while the rest go in the Alliance ship. The Alliance ship is able to take
off, but Baltar's escape is foiled because the Centurians had been
disassembled and, when put back together, didn't quite function up to par.

Director: Rod Holcomb
Guest Cast: Melody Anderson (Brenda Maxwell), Edward Mulhare (John),

Apollo and Starbuck follow the escaped Eastern Alliance ship back to Terra.
Before reaching it, they are picked up by the race of white lights that had
helped them against Count Iblis. Their representative, John, asks Apollo
to help avert a war that would destroy Terra. He is sent down, appearing
to all of the inhabitants as a man they had thought was dead. He is unable
to convince anyone, and is thrown in prison. Starbuck rescues him, and
they call the Galactica to try to help before Armageddon occurs. The
President of the Western people has made a treaty with the Eastern
Alliance, in which all hostilities will stop. However, the Eastern
Alliance is lying, and plans to strike when the guard is down. Apollo
lectures the people of how his own race was tricked, and before anything
can be done, the Eastern Alliance fires its warheads. The Galactica is
able to destroy all the bombs, and the frightened world powers open their
eyes and talk peace. In return for their help, Michael tells Apollo that
Terra is not the Earth that they are searching for.

be a traitor on board the Celestria. It is discovered that the captain of
the Celestra, Kronus, runs the ship like a dictator, and Aurora and
friends are a liberation force. It is learned that a junior officer is
really the one mistreating the crew, and that Kronus is only an iron-fisted

  Susan Shoop (Carlyle)

At last, the Galactica finds the planet Earth!  It's the year 1980 A.D.,
and their hopes are dashed when they find that the planet does not have the
technology to help defeat the Cylons. In fact, the Earth is bad off as it
is. The Galactica leaves Earth, so that the Cylons following do not find
it, but send down Capt. Troy (formerly Boxey, Adama's grandson) and Lt.
Dillon to contact Prof. Mortinson, a man they feel can help them to advance
Earth's technology quick enough to be of help. There is trouble, in the
form of Xavier, one of the Council of Twelve who feels that the Galacticans
should upgrade Earth by travelling into the past and introducing modern
devices (Dr. Zee has developed a time-travel device and a cloaking device,
both outfitted into Vipers). He goes to Nazi Germany, not caring about the
consequences, and Troy and Dillon, joined by reporter Jamie Hamilton of
Earth, follow him. They undo his damage, but lose Xavier somewhere in
time. Adama goes ahead with his plan to slowly upgrade Earth, Prof.
Mortinson is told that someday he will meet them again, and Jamies joins
the Colonial fleet.

  (Sheriff Ellsworth)

The Cylons launch a surprise attack on the fleet, doing considerable
damage. Troy and Dillon take the children of the fleet down to Earth to
protect them. With Jamie's help, they disguise themselves as scouts, but
they get into some trouble, such as when Dillon tries to change his gold
cubits in for American currency, and accidentally robs a bank. With the
police after them, the group camp out in the woods. However, some of the
children become ill from drinking polluted water from a chemical plant, and
there is a problem with the Colonists' bizarre anatomies. The children are
saved, however, and the plant is closed down.

Xavier returns, and gets rid of Troy and Dillon by sending them into space
in a sabotaged Viper. They are busy repairing the ship while Xavier tries
to kidnap the kids and hold them for ransom. Meanwhile, Jamie has taken
the children to a baseball camp for underprivileged kids where she is doing
a story. This of course results in them playing a game with their
super-powers, saving the camp from being closed down. Troy and Dillon
return in time to foil Xavier, but he escapes again.

The Cylon Empire has built a new type of Cylon, a humanoid android. One of
them, Andromus, along with a centurian, crashland on Earth. Troy and Dillon
attempt to catch them, but the Cylons are picked up by a group of people on
their way to a Halloween party. The Cylons learn that the party is
associated with a New York radio station, and seek to take control of the
station to send a message to a nearby Cylon Base ship that they have found
Earth. The Cylons attempt to over the radio station (where Wolfman Jack is
the D.J.). Troy and Dillon are slowed in their attempt to stop them when
they have to save a child in a penthouse fire started by the Cylons. They
save the child and stop the Cylons.

Space Croppers

Writer: Robert L. McCullough
Director: Dan Haller
Guest Cast: Ana Alicia (Gloria), Dana Elcar (Steadman), Ned Romero (Hector)

The Cylons again attack the fleet, taking out the Agroships. With their
food supply destroyed, Troy and Dillon enter a partnership with Hector
Alonzo, a farmer being threatened by a powerful and prejudiced land baron,
John Steadman. The Galacticans bring down Dr. Zee's anti-grav ship, and
Steadman spots this and calls in the police. The Galacticans hide the
evidence of their presence, put Steadman out of business, and get their
food.

The Return of Starbuck
Air Date: 1980-05-04
Writer: Glen A. Larson
Director: Ron Satlof
Guest Cast: Dirk Benedict (Starbuck), Judith Chapman (Angela), Rex Cutter
  (Cyrus)

At last, the fate of Starbuck is revealed. Prof. Zee was revealed in the
premiere to be a mutant and a child genius. He has a dream about
Starbuck, which he relates to Adama, who knows the story to be true.

Fourteen years earlier, while in a battle, Starbuck's Viper was gravely
damaged, and Boomer watched him wildly fly towards a planet. The fleet
could not go back for him, since the Cylons were on their tail. Starbuck
crashed onto the barren planet, his ship all but destroyed. There he finds
the remains of a Cylon fighter, of which one Cylon he is able to fix. He
does this out of loneliness. Cy, as he names him, first wishes to kill
Starbuck, because he is a human, but soon learns that they need each other,
and they become friends (to both of their surprise). Then a mysterious
pregnant woman appears, and Starbuck does his all to care for her, which
makes Cy jealous. However, Cy helps Starbuck build a tiny ship out of the
remains of both their ships, and after the woman gives birth, launches the
baby into space, the mysterious woman is gone. It was surmised that she was
from another dimension. Soon after, a Cylon patrol lands on the planet, and
when they find Starbuck they attempt to kill him. However, Cy gives his
life to save Starbuck, killing two of the Cylons before the third guns him
down. Starbuck finishes off the third Cylon, but Cy is too far gone to be
fixed. Starbuck is left alone again.

Adama reveals to Zee that he had come to the fleet in a small ship, and his
identity is revealed.

                                  CHARACTERS

       The Original Crew:

       Blake:    Earth native.  Crime: trying to overthrow  the  Federa-
                 tion.  Punishment:  At first, mindwiped and put on tri-
                 al, made to confess error of his ways,  rebellion  fiz-
                 zled.   Later,  after being recruited by new rebellion,
                 framed for child  molestation  and  sentenced  to  life
                 imprisonment  on  Cygnus  Alpha.   Highly  trusting and
                 idealistic.

       Avon:     Earth native.  Crime: embezzlement.  Tried to break the
                 Federation  banking  cartel.  Galaxy's second best com-
                 puter programmer (the first was the person  who  caught
                 him).   Had  psychopathic tendencies, which worsened as
                 show continued, especially in fourth season.   Enlisted
                 in  attempt  for  freedom  from  prison  ship London by
                 Blake.

       Vila:     Earth native.  Crime: theft.  Vila is a  chronic  thief
                 and alcoholic.  Met Blake while waiting in holding cell
                 for trip to Cygnus Alpha (Vila was in  the  process  of
                 liberating  Blake's  watch).  Terrible coward, but very
                 intelligent at times.

       Jenna:    Crime: smuggling.  Also met Blake while waiting  to  go
                 to Cygnus Alpha.  Had great fondness for Blake.

       Gan:      Crime: murder.  Killed the  Federation  guard  who  had
                 raped   his   girlfriend.   Has  limiter  implant  that
                 prevents him from  violence.   Friend  of  Vila's  from
                 prison ship London.

       Cally:    Auron native.  Guerrilla fighter.  Telepathic (can only
                 send  to  other life forms, two way with other Aurons).
                 Was only survivor of an anti-Federation guerrilla  mis-
                 sion,  and  could  not  return  to her world due to her
                 failure to complete the mission.   Liked  Blake  &  be-
                 lieved in his cause, so joined crew.

       Zen:      Alien computer that  runs  the  Liberator's  functions.
                 Zen's primary duty is to preserve the ship, and will do
                 so to the point of rejecting orders which  are  certain
                 to result in the ship's destruction.

       Blake's 7                                           Program Guide


       Replacements/Additions:

       Tarrant:  Ex-Federation starship pilot.  Stole a Federation  ship
                 and  found  the  Liberator  in the wake of the Galactic
                 War.  Having nowhere else to go, joined crew.  Very im-
                 pulsive and headstrong.

       Dayna:    Earth native.  Father offended Federation somehow,  was
                 in exile.  Weapons specialist extraordinare.  Has blood
                 feud with/Servalan, who murdered her father.

       Soolin:   Joins crew after death  of  Dorian,  orginal  owner  of
                 Scorpio.  Excellent gunmaster, also has blood feud with
                 Federation.  Semi-assassin.

       Orac:     Galaxy's most powerful (if  ornery)  computer.   Has  a
                 carrier  wave capability that can link with and control
                 other computer systems across  light  years  of  space.
                 Would  much  rather  spend  time contemplating the mys-
                 teries of the Universe than helping mere mortals.

       Slave:    Master computer of the Scorpio.   Very  meek,  and  has
                 severe  inferiority  complex.   Can be very humorous at
                 times.

       The Bad Guys:

       The Federation: Very Big-Brotherish.  Earth  and  all  the  other
                 planets  ruled  by  the  Federation  are  controlled by
                 drugged air, food, water, and nothing is  done  without
                 approval  from  the  Federation.   See  George Orwell's
                 "1984" for a good idea of what life  is  like  in  this
                 time period.

       Servalan: The most evil person in the  Galaxy.   Has  ceaselessly
                 worked  her  way  up  the  Federation hierarchy through
                 double-crossing, backstabbing, and murder.   Will  stop
                 at nothing until she achieves total rule of the galaxy.

       Travis:   Servalan's right hand man.  Has blood-feud with  Blake,
                 who  nearly  killed  him.  Arm was destroyed when Blake
                 fired upon him;  it has been replaced by a robotic  arm
                 with an embedded blaster gun.

       of a standard Federation computer and a  pleasure  planet  gaming
       machine.  The only episode where Scorpio fires its weaponry.

       A plan to steal a shipment of  atomically  converted  gold  being
       transported  from  the  planet  Xeroc aboard a domestic passenger
       ship winds up turning into a major loss for the crew.   Note  the
       aluminum  pie plates which comprise the interior of the passenger

       Avon inspects for the ship's records.


       50) Orbit

                  7-Dec-81      48:36     Robert      Holmes       Brian
       Lighthill

       The scientist Egrorian offers Avon a powerful weapon, the Tachyon
       Funnel,  in  exchange  for  Orac.   Servalan,  who  is behind the
       transfer, prepares a plan to double-cross Avon  that  would  give
       her  both  the Tachyon Funnel and Orac.  Avon nearly murders Vila

       52) Blake

                 21-Dec-81      49:39     Chris Boucher       Mary Ridge

       After Orac traces Blake's trail to the planet Gauda  Prime,  Avon
       and  crew  travel there, leaving the destroyed Xenon base behind.

       Blake, and discover that he may have sold out to the  Federation.
       Another important episode for Avon and the series.

NOTES
1-       The first column contains a sequential program number.
2-       The second column contains the BBC production number.
3-       The third column contains the title.
         An asterisk "*" indicates a lost story.
         The number/s in parentheses "( )" list those episodes that exist.
         The number/s in angles "< >" list those episodes that are 
         rumored to exist
         The number in square brackets "[ ]" is the total amount of episodes.
         The number/s in curved brackets "{ }" list the episodes only in B&W, 
         when some are color and some are not.
         The a=something refers to those episodes whose audio tracks exist.
         c= and bw= refer to color  or black and white. 
4-       The fourth column contains the date of the first airing 
         on the BBC, and of the last airing if known.
5-       The fifth column contains the total run time, when known.
6-       The 19th through 21st seasons aired on consecutive nights.
7-       The 22nd season episodes are 45 minutes long.
8-       Story 68 has been reconstructed into the complete movie form.  
         Lionheart does not have it available in this form.
9-       Story 71 is one episode short for all-color showings; 
         some stations may apparently show one episode in B&W.
10-      The 500th episode is part one of "The Armageddon Factor" (#103).
11-      The original twenty-third season was not shown due 
         to an eighteen month hiatus at the BBC. 
12-      All shows are B&W up to story 3G, except for story 3J.  
         All the rest can be found in color or partly in color.
         (I am not totally sure about this statement, but I DO know
          that the stories for the first two Doctors were filmed in
          black and white, and the later ones were originally filmed
          in color.  Some of the Pertwee ones exist only in B&W, and
          some of the earlier ones are missing, because they were 
          destroyed by the BBC before they realized that they would 
          used later.  Some of the missing episodes have been recovered,
          but I think about 100 are still missing on video.  For a more
          complete explanation, ask on rec.arts.drwho.)

@node "Johnny Quest" "Document_18"
THE JONNY QUEST EPISODE GUIDE -----------------------------

(All episodes listed here are from the original run of the series in
1964-65.) Plus I should point out that there are plenty of what would be
considered SPOILERS if these shows hadn't been shown hundreds of times in the
last 26 years. If you are SPOILER ALLERGIC, do not read!!!


1. MYSTERY OF THE LIZARD-MEN

Dr. Quest is called in to investigate a series of ships disappearing in the
Sargasso Sea. The plot, involving frogmen disguised as lizardmen, is to use a
laser beam to bring down the Man to the Moon rocket launch. Jonny  and Race
get captured and then escape and Dr. Quest foils the evil plans. (This is one
of the episodes that Hadji does not appear in.)

2. ARCTIC SPLASH DOWN

Dr. Quest and some enemy agents are in a race to recover a rocket brought
down in the Arctic by the enemy agents in an attempt to get ahold of Dr.
Quest's new missle directional device.

3. THE CURSE OF ANUBIS

My personal favorite episode along with "The Robot Spy". It involves an
Egyptian nationalist who steals a statue of the god, Anubis. He calls in  Dr.
Quest to investigate. His plot is to blame the theft on Dr. Quest in  order
to unite his peoples against the West. Little does he know that his theft has
awakened a 2000 year old, giant, unstoppable mummy bent on  revenge. The
thief traps Dr. Quest and Race in a catacomb and unleashes  some poisonous
asps to do them in. After they are freed by Jonny and Hadji, the evil-doer
meets his ends at the hands of the giant mummy.

4. PURSUIT OF THE PO-HO

Dr. Quest is called in to rescue a fellow scientist captured by the Po-Ho
natives. Dr. Quest tries to use an airplane and a loudspeaker to do the old
"I am a god." trick on the natives but his trick backfires, and he gets
captured and is due to be sacrificed along with the other scientist. Race
stains himself with purple berry juice and pulls off the same "I am a god."
trick with more success and rescues the Doc and his friend.

5. RIDDLE OF THE GOLD

The first episode shown with the evil Dr. Zin, this has one of the more
complicated plots of the series. A henchman of Dr. Zin, Cassim, and the
Marharajah of some country are involved in a scheme with Zin to manufacture
gold. They have captured the scientist who has perfected the process and lure
in Dr. Quest to bump Quest off since Quest is determined to be the  only
other person that would be able to determine the gold is man-made. Cassim
kills and impersonates the Maharajah after the latter attempts a greedy
double-cross. After several attempts on the Quests, Jonny and Hadji discover
the captured scientist. Just as he warns them,, they are all captured and put
in a cave to be killed. Bandit ends up saving the day, and Dr. Zin escapes
vowing to return.

6. TREASURE OF THE TEMPLE

Dr. Quest and party go to explore some Mayan ruins in South America. They
don't know some bad guys are already there looking for a hidden treasure. The
crooks attempt to frighten off Dr. Quest and party to no avail. After Jonny
and Hadji stumble over the treasure room, the whole gang is captured only to
be rescued by a native the party had befriended earlier. In an escape in an
underground river and cavern, shooting weakens several stalactites and....
well, you can guess what happens to the bad guys.

7. CALCUTTA ADVENTURE

(This is the episode that details how Hadji became part of the Quest clan.)
In India to demonstrate a new sonic beam device of great power, the Quests
meet and Indian orphan Hadji, and Hadji's friend, the Pasha Peddler (who has
the voice of the Maytag Repairman) a con man and salesman deluxe. Checking
out some sick natives, Quest finds a hidden mountain installation who is
responsible with their nerve gas experiments. Dr. Quest gets captured and
Pasha and the boys help Race rescue him. The sonic device takes care of the
snow covered moutain base.

8. DR. ZIN'S ROBOT SPY

Dr. Quest is working on a para-power ray gun (hey, I just relate the plot
lines!) and Dr. Zin sends a indestructible spider-like one-eyed robot spy to
spec it out. Nothing from tanks to flame throwers can stop the robot from
escaping with the plans until the para-power gun is used itself.

9. DOUBLE DANGER

This episode has it all. Dr. Zin plus one of only two appearances by the
sultry competant Jezebel Jade, mercenary-spy and Race's (ex?) flame. Anyway,
while Dr. Quest is researching a vine that will produce a suspended animation
effect on astronauts, Dr. Zin captures Race and replaces him with an exact
double. Zin wants to use the drug to produce nations of helpless zombies at
his control. The double is discovered after a suspicious Jade asks phony Race
for a kiss and the plot is discovered and foiled. As Jade explains later,
"There is only *ONE* Race Bannon!" adding to Race's  reputation in ways the
family hour would never allow!

10. SHADOW OF THE CONDOR

While flying through the Andes, plane problems cause Race to land on a hidden
mountain top lair inhabited by a World War I German Baron and air ace. The
Baron manuevers Race into a dogfight combat in WWI planes but doesn't bother
to load Race's guns with ammunition. It looks like curtains for Race until
the title star comes winging in and causes the Baron to crash.

11. SKULL AND DOUBLE CROSSBONES

While Dr. Quest is exploring deep-sea marine life, Jonny finds a portion of
some Spanish treasure. The cook on the Quest's boat is a planted bad guy who
was hoping they would discover where the treasure was. After the Quest crew
is captured, Bandit swims to the Police and brings them back to save the
day.

12. DREADFUL DOLL

Dr. Quest is called in to check out a little girl on a Caribean island who
seems to have been hoo-dooed by voo-doo. Dr. Quest, spoiling the whole
atmosphere of the episode, announces almost immediately that the girl has
been drugged. Seems someone wants to contruct a secret submarine base and is
using the voo-doo scare to get plantation owners to leave. First, Jonny and
Hadji recue a captured Race and then they all rescue the captured Dr. Quest
and foil the bad guys.

13. A SMALL MATTER OF PYGMIES

Played mostly for laughs with lots of short and little people jokes, Race
develops plane trouble again while flying to meet Dr. Quest (seems plane
repair was not among Dr. Quest's strengths!) and lands smack dab in the
middle of the pygmies. Dr. Quest shows up at the last minute to save Race and
the boys and gets the important letter Race was bringing him. An  invitation
to a talk on "Are Pygmies a Warm and Friendly People?"

14. THE DRAGONS OF ASHIDA

Dr. Quest goes to visit Dr. Ashida, a scientist gone off the deep end. Seems
Ashida is big on one on one combats, first involving giant lizards agianst
each other and then him against Race. But Race pisses him off by beating him.
After the party tries to leave the demented doctor's island, they are forced
back by the giant lizards. Now Race must face Ashida's giant henchman, Sumi,
in one on one combat to win the party's escape. Race wins again but Ashida
tries to keep them and throw Sumi to the giant lizards. But they escape and
Sumi makes Dr. Ashida the lizard-snack instead.

15. TURU THE TERRIBLE

Written in every globe-trotting scientist's handbook is the rule, "Thou shalt
uncover at least one land of lost dinosaurs." This time, the Quests stumble
over a pet pteranodon called Turu who is being kept by a wheel chair bound
baddie using Turu to terrorize natives into mining a precious metal for him.
The Quests bust up his scheme by busting up his prehistoric bird with
bazookas. Although the bad guy is a slaver, it still tugs your heart strings
when he leaps into a tar pit to try and save his mortally wounded pet.

16. THE FRADULENT VOLCANO

After Dr. Quest snuffs out an oil fire with a new invention, an island  calls
him in to do the same to their recently erupting volcano. As a precursor to
SPECTRE's plans a few years later in "You Only Live Twice", the volcanic
eruptions are really Dr. Zin operating from a hidden base in the volcano
testing a new destructive weapon. Zin brings down Race and Dr. Quest with an
invisible ray (which reminds one of the para-power ray gun he didn't get in
"The Robot Spy") and captures them. Jonny, Hadji, and a police man rescue
them, the bad guys are foiled, but Dr. Zin, of course, escapes yet again.

17. THE WEREWOLF OF THE TIMBERLAND

While hunting for some petrified wood in the Canadian hinterlands, the Quests
run into a logger who is using hollowed logs for smuggling. The bad guy is
using a werewolf costume to try and scare people away, but an Indian called
White Feather (who has Race Bannon's voice) and his pet wolf help Jonny and
Hadji reveal the scheme. Race almost shoots White Feather's wolf after the
wolf fights off the guy in the werewolf costume, but Jonny shows up in time
to save the wolf.

18. PIRATES FROM BELOW

Dr. Quest is working with a new submarine device which, of course, is also
wanted by some nasty bad guys. When Dr. Quest and Hadji are away, Race and
Jonny are captured. After Jonny is threatened, Race turns over the sub to the
bad guys. They escape and are recaptured and this time get Jonny to reveal
where Dr. Quest is by threatening Race. They all get captured, but Hadji uses
some hypnotism hocus-pocus to get them out and the bad guys are felled by
their own traps once again.

19. ATTACK OF THE TREE PEOPLE

Another one played mostly for laughs, as after a boat crash (no planes
around?), Jonny and Hadji get seperated from Race and Dr. Quest and are
adopted by a bunch of anthromorphic apes. The boys get captured by some
two-bit hoods who later also capture Dr. Quest and Race and force them to
call for a big ransom to get the boys back. But the apes save the boys and
bop the bad guys in some humorous exchanges.

20. THE INVISIBLE MONSTER

Along with "The Sea Haunt", one of my *least* favorites. Most of the time,
Jonny Quest at least tried to vaguely stay within the realm of scientific
possibility, but this episode *really* pushes your suspension of disbelief.
It involves a 20 foot tall invisible energy monster (shades of "Forbidden
Planet") which they find by dropping paint bombs while flying above it in
their portable rocket backpacks. Dr. Quest lures it to its doom by using
light bulbs!

21. THE DEVIL'S TOWER

Borrowing from several other episodes, Dr. Quest loses a weather ballon on a
mile-high plateau which is occupied by another hidden German war criminal
with an airplane who is using natives to mine for him. They all get captured
and the German tries to fly off with all his mined diamonds. Finding a hidden
passage to get down the mountainside, the German tries to throw grenades at
the Quests, but ends up eventually hitting his own plane. Ka-pow!

22. THE QUETONG MISSLE MYSTERY

Like "Calcutta Adventure", a bad guy's secret base's ecological pollution
ends up sickening some natives which brings in the Quest party. This time the
poison is from missle fuel from a secret missle base led by General Fong.
This time, a phony police man kidnaps the boys to make Quest back off, but
Race and Dr. Quest stage a two-man rescue using knockout gas. In a race to
escape through a mine field, the General orders the mines exploded just in
time to get his own boat.

23. THE HOUSE OF SEVEN GARGOYLES

(Great Swedish cartoon accents in this one!). Professor Erikson has invented
an anti-gravity device called the Erik-on Bar that, naturally, some bad guys
want to steal. A spy is hidden atop the Erikson's castle as a gargoyle. The
gargoyle steals the bar but then is shot by his boss off his perch on the
castle. As the Quests chase the bad guy's sub down a fjord in a helicopter,
the bad guy henchmen try to shoot the helicopter down which only causes an
avalanche that buries them and the bar.

24. TERROR ISLAND

Another great episode with the second and final appearance of Jezebel Jade.
Dr. Quest is kidnapped by an evil scientist growing giant monsters who wants
Dr. Quest to help him. In yet another ecological comment 10 years ahead of
its time, Dr. Quest points out how the bad guy's waste products are growing
giant monsters in the swamps outside. Anyway, Race knows when he is over his
head and goes to Jade for help. Then he decides not to wait for her, and ends
up (with the boys as stowaways) getting captured only to be rescued in the
end by Jade who tells Race, "I told you *I* would handle this." Gotta love
her! The bad guy ends up getting fried along with his giant creations.

25. MONSTERS IN THE MONASTERY

The Quest gang goes to visit Dr. Quest's friend, the Raj Guru, who is worried
that the Abominable Snowmen have come down from the mountains to terrorize
his village. But if you have been paying attention so far, you know it is
some bad guys trying to frighten off the people and topple Raj Guru. Jonny
and Hadji investigate, get captured, escape, have a wild chase scene, and
return with the proof of the scheme. However, since the REAL Abominable
Snowmen show up to polish off the bad guys, it becomes a moot point.

26. THE SEA HAUNT

The series goes out with a poor effort involving a laughable deep sea frog
monster and an offensive Asian galley cook cariacture on an abandoned boat.
Like the other ridiculous monster in the series, this one is defeated using
light bulbs and torches. Dr. Quest finds a treasure in gold aboard the boat
which it is inferred that they will keep and they get rescued by a passing
plane.

@node "Max Headroom" "Document_23"
                                MAX HEADROOM

03/31/87 Debut: In the near future, when TVs can't be shut off and ratings
are all  that matter, investigative reporter Edison Carter (Matt Frewer) and
his computer-generated alter ego Max Headroom battle to keep the "blank"
generation informed.  In the opener, Carter stumbles across his own network's
cover-up of a sometimes deadly new form of TV advertising called "blipverts".
Bryce: Chris Young.  Theora: Amanda Pays.  Murray: Jeffrey Tambor.
Grossberg...Charles Rocket, Gorrister...Ken Swofford, Florence...Billie Byrd,
Ms Formby...Virginia Kiser.

04/07/87 Theora may lose her job when she runs off to help her estranged
brother, who's competing in a brutal sport that promoters want legalized and
televised. Shawn...Peter Cohl, Jack Friday...Wortham Krimmer, Rik...JW Smith,
Ped Zing... Arsenio "Sonny" Trinidad.

04/14/87 Carter races against time to save a woman who was shanghaied and
sold to a "body bank" for experimentation. Meanwhile,  Network 23's largest
sponsor wants Max as spokesman.  Cheviot: George Coe.  Formby...Virginia
Kiser, Blank Reg...Morgan Sheppard, Dominique...Concetta Tomei, Mel...Scott
Kraft, Plantaganet...John Winston, Rik...JW Smith.

04/21/87 Carter is accused of credit fraud and becomes a fugitive after
delving into  the hostile takeover of Security Systems, the world's most
powerful corporation. Cheviot: George Coe, Rik...JW Smith,
Dominique...Concetta Tomei, Blank Reg... Morgan Sheppard, Valerie
Towne...Carol Mayo Jenkins, Voice of A-7...Sally Stevens.

04/28/87 Network 23 finds that the fine line between news and entertainment
may very well be the bottom line. Dancing on that line is Braddock, a double
dealing program packager who offers to sell Network 23 the exclusive rights
to cover  an urban-guerilla group's terrorist activities during a crucial
24-hour global ratings-sweep period.  The network turns Braddock's offer
down, but a smaller rival accepts.Broadcasting from a terrorist bombing site,
its ratings soar -- as Network 23's plummet.  Barred from that site is
Network 23 ace reporter Edison Carter, to the annoyance of some Network 23
board members.  But network head Ben Cheviot knows Braddock's reputation and
assigns Carter to investigate. Braddock: Gary Swenson.  Croyd Hauser: Robert
O'Reilly.  Janie Crane: Lisa Niemi.  Lucian: J Michael Flynn.

05/05/87 As the "blanks" -- undesirables with no computer records -- are
rounded up and arrested, the networks face permanent cancellation by hackers
who threaten to crash the city's entire computer system if their companions
aren't released. Peller...Howard Sherman, Bruno...Peter Crook, Ashwell...Hank
Garret, Blank Reg ...Morgan Sheppard, Dominique...Concetta Tomei.

                        MAX HEADROOM Episode Guide


Titles for first season episodes come from the Japanese laserdiscs; for the
second season, from THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF TV SCIENCE FICTION (London: Boxtree,
1990). I've seen alternate titles for a couple of episodes listed elsewhere,
and these are included in brackets. Broadcast dates are for first US airing,
except for the original pilot film, for which the date given is the first UK
broadcast date. The 14th episode was never broadcast in the US, but has been
shown in foreign markets. The first episode is essentially a remake of the
original pilot film. At the end are the titles for three episodes that never
made it past the script stage. These are to my knowledge the only unproduced
episodes that have been accounted for.

    Please Stand By (pilot title)

	A radio engineer experimenting with a 3-D TV scanner accidentally
	teleports to Earth a being from the Andromeda Galaxy.

	Package notes:

	Oscar-winner Cliff Robertson stars as Allan Maxwell, a radio station
	owner who plunders his station's resources to build and power a three-
	dimensional television receiver capable of displaying deep-space radio
	signals.  These strange radio waves suddenly take the form of a
	"galaxy being" composed of pure energy, whose own curiosity has led
	it to Earth.

	The alien's strange, glowing form and deadly radiation trigger a tide
	of panic and violence.  Only Maxwell can avert a showdown--at the
	possible cost of his own life!

	A drug which makes flesh plastic enables a foreign agent to impersonate
	a US presidential candidate.

	Package notes:

	No one knows, but the President is not who he appears to be.  In a
	terrifying timely story of genetic engineering and East-West powerplay,
	"The Hundred Days of the Dragon" stars Sidney Blackmer (Rosemary's
	Baby) as a popular American President who puts into place a master
	plan to slowly and steadily destroy the United States.  Only the
	President's daughter can stop him--if she can uncover his secret before
	it's too late.  A classic shiller from the TV series that influenced
	a generation of horror and suspense films.

 3. The Architects of Fear*
     9/30/63		19-26 Jun 63

	A team of desperate scientists, seeking an end to the threat of war,
	surgically metamorphose scientist Robert Culp into an "alien" in an
	elaborate scenario designed to frighten the world's nations into
	peaceful coexistance by creating for them a "common enemy"--an enemy
	from space.  Culp's death is faked--not even his wife is aware of the
	plan--and he's then subjected to a series of operations.  But the
	noble scheme backfires: His spaceship crashes in a wooded area, where
	he is shot by frightened hunters.  The "creature" limps back to the
	lab and reveals himself to his horrified wife before collapsing at
	her feet.

	Package notes:

	Grimly concluding that a common enemy, not love, is the only hope in
	unifying the warring nations of Earth, a group of scientists set out
	to secretly create the ultimate, global threat--an all-powerful alien
	monster.  But can fear save the world?  Robert Culp stars as the
	idealistic scientist chosen to undergo the painful and bizarre
	mutation from human to Thetan ("I am Caliban--with a Ph.D!").
	Considered a special effects masterpiece, the resulting creature was
	judged so frightening by several local television stations that they
	actually blacked out the screen during the Thetan's appearance!

		Yvette Leighton (Geraldine Brooks)
		Dr. Phillip Gainer (Leonard Stone)

	A meek university professor finds that his unconscious mind is
	destroying those with whom he becomes angry.

	Package notes:

	Donald Pleasence ("Halloween", "Escape From New York") if Harold
	Finley, a meek, unassuming college professor who invents a device
	capable of controlling the entire electro-magnetic spectrum.  Implanted
	in his brain, the device gives Finley the ability to mentally direct
	this unlimited energy source.  When a storn-like cloud of electricity
	attacks his sharp-tounged wife and domineering school dean, he realizes
	the device has unleashed a subconscious thirst for revenge--with
	uncontrollable and deadly results.

    10/14/63		20-27 Aug 63

	An uneducated miner (David McCallum) volunteers for an experiment in
	the acceleration of human evolution, and is transformed into a man of
	the distant future.  Possessing a bulging cranium and a vast intellect,
	he grows increasingly aloof toward the rest of mankind, coming to
	regard human beings as little more than insects.

	Before setting out to destroy the nearby town as an example of his
	power, he returns to the laboratory and directs his former sweetheart
	to operate the controls of the apparatus which will catapult him to the
	furthest limit of man's evolutionary potential.  The heartbroken girl
	instead returns him to the former, 20th-century self.

	Package notes:

	A benign and brilliant scientist (Edward Mulhare) discovers a way to
	accelerate human evolution.  David McCallum (superagent Illya Kuryakin
	from "The Man From Uncle") plays the bitter young coal miner who is
	miraculously transformed into the man of the future.  As a result of
	the experiment, the size of his brain grows grotesquely, a 'sixth
	finger' appears, and he becomes the possessor of tremendous mental
	powers!

    10/28/63		27 Aug-4 Sep 63

	An astronaut returning from a deep-space mission passes through a
	time warp and lands on the desolate Earth of 2148.  He meets a dis-
	figured mutant named Andro (Martin Landau) who informs him that
	civilization was wiped out by an extraterrestrial microbe developed
	by a biologist named Bertram Cabot Jr.

	Hoping to return to the 20th century to prevent Cabot from unleashing
	the microbe, the two men pilot the ship back through the time warp, but
	only Andro survives the trip.  Through various intrigues, he manages
	to prevent the birth of Cabot, thereby saving the future from deadly
	pestilence.

	Package notes:

	A time and space traveller journeys into the future, where the
	bacterium invention of a crazed twentieth century scientist has turned
	humans into mutants.  Accompanied by the ghoulish Andro (Martin Landau),
	the astronaut races back in time to kill the scientist and save the
	future of the world.

	But only Andro survives, and he arrives too early--before the infant is
	born.  He must disguise his appearance and convince the mother-to-be

 7. O.B.I.T.*
    11/04/63		13-20 Sep 63

	A senatorial committee uncovers an alien plot to demoralize the human
	race with surveillance machines capable of spying on anyone.

	Package notes:

	"It's awful--a_w_f_u_l!...It's the most hideous creation ever
	conceived!  No one can laugh, or joke.  It watches, sap 
        the very spirit.  And the worst thing of all is I watch it.  I 
        can't not look.  It's like
	a drug--a horrible drug.  You can't resist.  It's an addiction."

	These words of testimony are babbled by the crumbling Colonel Grover to
	describe OBIT--The Outer Band Individuated Teletracer--a hellishly
	precise surveillance machine of questionable origin.  Uncovered by a
	murder investigation at a Defense Department research center, OBIT
	proves to be an insidious instrument that breads fear and hostility.

	Both cautionary tale and tight courtroom drama, O.B.I.T. explores 
        the fear and hostility that result when all privacy is eliminated...
        and all secrets are revealed.

10. Nightmare*
    12/02/63		23-20 Sep 63
    Ebon Struck First (original title)

	The alien Ebonites mistakenly attack Earth, then promise to do anything
	to rectify their grave error.  Earth's military leaders insist they
	take part in a psychological test of the capabilities of Earth's
	fighting men:  The Ebonites will make believe an interplanetary war
	is going on and will subject human POWs they've captured to a variety
	of excruciating tortures.  The aliens play the ruse for only so long,
	then rebel at the prospect of continuing with the cruel charade.  A
	chilling effort, it makes excellent use of a frequent "Outer Limits"
	motif--unearthly aliens who prove to be more humane than the humans
	around them.

	Package notes:

	A young Martin Sheen is part of a six-man multinational strike force
	captured on the planet Ebon and made prisoners of war.  The Ebonites--
	satanic, batwinged, gargoyle-like aliens--brutally interrogate their
	prisoners with torture, drugs and vivid hallucinations.

	After painful "exploratory interviews," the group is allowed basic
	necessities and the "respect due a conquered enemy."  This leads the
	prisoners to conclude that there is a traitor among them, someone
	who must be killed!

	Arguably "The Outer Limits" best-written show, "Nightmare" is a tour
	de force of ensemble acting that brings to life an horrific view of
	phobia and conspiracy.

	Cast	Col. Luke Stone (Ed Nelson)
		Major Jong (James Shigeta)
		Ebonite Interrogator (John Anderson)
		Pvt. Arthur Dix (Martin Sheen)
		Lt. James P. Willowmore (Bill Gunn)

11. It Crawled Out Of The Woodwork
    12/09/63		18-25 Oct 63

	A mysterious ball of dust at an energy research facility erupts into
	a huge, formless creature of pure energy.  The psychotic head of the
	facility, Dr. Block (Kent Smith), learns to control the creature, and
	uses it to intimidate and control his employees.  Eventually the police
	sergeant (Ed Asner) finds out, and Dr. Block is killed in a shootout,
	but not before unleashing the ravenous energy creature, which heads
	for the nearby town.  The sergeant has the town's electricity shut off
	completely, and the mindless creature has no alternative but to return
	to the research facility, where the generators provide its only source
	of nourishment.  Though under control for the moment, a way must be
	found to live with the creature peaceably--for energy can be neither
	created nor destroyed.  A cautionary tale on the necessary hazards of
	life in the atomic age.

	hideous appearance is revealed when a couple of losers-on-the-run
	(one played by a young Bruce Dern) penetrate the restricted area and
	the Zanti creatures loose a vicious attack!

	Alien parasites take over the bodies of influential human beings in an
	attempt to overthrow the governments of the world.

	Package notes:

	"You do not know these men.  You may have looked at them, but you did
	not see them.  They are newspapers blowing down a gutter on a windy
	night...Today, finally, they will join the hu--I almost said the human
	race.  And that would have been a half-truth.  For the race they are
	joining...is only half-human..."

	"Heros die alone" is the credo by which secret government agent Spain
	(Don Gordon) operates.  A loner in enemy territory, he infiltrates the
	ranks of the invisibles--a subversive underground society of the nation's
	power brokers who are possessed by alien parasites (one of whom is
	played by "Family Feud"'s Richard Dawson).

	Pushed to the razor's edge of endurance, Spain fights a brutal, suspense-
	laden battle against the spread of the alien infection.  Considered among
	the most unnerving of all "Outer Limits" episodes, writer/producer
	Joseph Stefano epitomized the effect as "one of overall, pervading evil."

20. The Bellero Shield
     2/10/64		6-16 Dec 63

	A scientist's laser, aimed at the heavens, provides the means for an
	angelic alien (John Hoyt) to descend to Earth.  At first it protects
	itself with a device that generates an invisible shield, but soon
	dispenses with the device as it comes to trust the human hosts.  This
	proves to be a grave error, for the scientist's scheming wife (Sally
	Kellerman) shoots the being and steals his shield, intending to present
	it to the world as the invention of her brilliant husband (Martin
	Landau).  When she throws the shield around herself, however, she's
	unable to deactivate it.  Trapped, and with a limited amount of air
	within the shield, she breaks down and confesses her crime.  Suddenly
	the dying alien appears, and its last act is to deactivate the shield,
	but the experience has driven the woman mad.

21. The Children Of Spider County
     2/17/64		6-13 Jan 64

	An alien beings returns to Earth to claim five young geniuses, born of

    2/24/64		12-20 Aug 63

	Alien spores which mature into flowers that emit a lethal gas are
	brought to Earth.

	Package notes:

	"Specimen: Unknown," The Outer Limits' highest-rated episode ever,
	features a young Dabney Coleman as Lieutenant Rupert Howard, a
	scientist assigned to the Project Adonis space station.

	When he discovers strange life forms clinging to the walls of the space
	lab, he removes several of the mushroom-shaped "space barnacles" and
	incubates them for examination.  They quickly mature into huge white
	flowers and, without warning, spray Howard with fresh spores and a
	lethal vapor.

	The incident triggers an investigation which is delayed by a shift in
	space station personnel.  By the time anyone realizes the plants are
	deadly, they are already aboard a shuttle bound for earth with a new
	crew.  It is interesting to note that this episode aired 15 years
	before Alien.

	of all but their last few drops of blood..."

	The Senator, a sporting alien representing the citizenry of planet Andera,
	abducts ex-boxer Mike Benson (Nick Adams) and troubled divorcee Laura
	Hanley (Nancy Malone), "electroporting" them to a distant, neutral
	planet.

	of Earth will be teleported to Luminos.  But if a majority dies, then
	the Luminoids will look elsewhere for labor.  A few members of the
	community do become infected, but not enough for humans to fail the
	test.  In a moving conclusion, the healthy join hands with the sick,
	deliberately infecting themselves so that the Luminoids will spare
	Earth's population.

	they are in the possession of the aliens.  Culp hunts the aliens
	down one by one and wrests the missing fingers from them.  With the
	fingers plugged in, the hand can at last reveal Culp's identity and
	purpose.  He is an android and stored on a wire in his hand is the
	entire Earth population, converted to electrical impulses to escape
	alien invasion.  An imaginative script by Harlan Ellison.

	Package notes:

	In a role written for him by famed sci-fi writer, Harlan Ellison,

	who escapes back into our present.  Pursued by the Kyben--an alien
	race which has conquered future Earth--the fate of all humankind lies
	in Trent's glass hand.

    Introduction from the Fall Preview issue:

    "All humans look alike, you know that"... "Bad enough having all the
    humans in the house... but wash first. There's a smell about you."...
    "These humans are dangerous! They think they are as good as we are.
    They stir up trouble." The speakers are gorillas. The time is 2000
    years from now, and apes rule the earth, while human beings are
    considered "a lower species." Into this upside-down world come a pair
    of 20th-Century astronauts, who are stranded there after passing
    through a time warp. The anthropoid leaders (Booth Colman and Mark
    Lenard) are determined to hunt down these two alien troublemakers, and
    the astronauts are just as determined to keep themselves from being
    enslaved or killed. They are befriended by a chimp (Roddy McDowall) who
    is very broad-minded about being seen in the company of his zoological
    inferiors. All of this outlandish monkey business is, of course, based
    on the "Planet of the Apes" movies. The films were immensely popular in
    their TV showings, and now CBS yearns to ape the ratings every Friday.
    Debut: CBS, Sept.  13. Pictured (l.-.r) James Naughton, Roddy McDowall,
    Ron Harper.

Debut: A British series following the strange adventures of Dave Lister, the
lone survivor of a disaster in outer space that wipes out his ship's crew.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is an S.O.S.  distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf.   The crew
are dead,  killed  by a  radiation leak.   The  only survivours  are:  Dave
Lister, who  was  in  suspended  animation  during  the  disaster,  and his
pregnant cat, who  was safely  sealed in  the hold.   Revived three-million
years later, Lister's only companions are:   a  life form  who evolved from
his cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation of one of the dead crew.

                                                -- Holly (opening speech)

End credit song lyrics:

     It's cold outside, there's no kind of atmosphere,
     I'm all alone, more or less.
     Let me fly far away from here,
     Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun.

     I want to live shipwrecked and comatose,
     Drinking fresh mango juice.
     Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes,
     Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun,
     Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun.

SYNOPSIS:
Lister and Rimmer finally arrive back on Earth through a time hole--only
to discover time is running backwards and so are the inhabitants.

Three million years in the future, Dave Lister, the last human being alive,
discovers he is pregnant after a liaison with his female self in a parallel
universe. His pregnancy concludes with the successful delivery of twin boys,
Jim and Baxley. However, because the boys were conceived in another universe,
with different physical laws, they suffer from highly accelerated growth rates
and are both eighteen years old within three days of being born. In order to
save their lives, Lister returns them to the universe of their origin, where
they are reunited with their father (a woman), and are able to lead
comparatively normal lives. Well, as normal as you can be if you've been born
in a parallel universe and your father's a woman and your mother's a man and
you're eighteen years old three days after your birth. Shortly afterwards,
Kryten, the service mechanoid, who had left the ship after being rescued from
his own crashed vessel, the Nova 5, is found in pieces after his space bike
crashed into an astroid. Lister rebuilds the 'roid, but is unable to recapture
his former personality. Meanwhile, Holly, the increasingly erratic Red Dwarf
computer, performs a head sex change operation on himself. He bases his new
face on Hilly, a female computer with whom he'd once fallen madly in love.

TITLE:      Camille
AIR DATE:   2/14/1991 9:00 pm, BBC 2

SYNOPSIS:

Kryten, Red  Dwarf's  on-board  mechanoid,  rescues  a female  droid from a
crashed vessel.  She, like him, is a 4,000 series,  but Camille  is the GTi
model, with realistic toes and  a slide-back  sun-roof head.   Kryten finds
himself falling in advanced mutual compatibility on the basis  of a primary
initial ident, or what humans call "love at first sight", but the course of
true advanced mutual compatibility never runs in a non-glitch bug-free way.

SEASON:     5
EPISODE:    25
TITLE:      Holoship
AIR DATE:   2/20/92 (9:00 pm, BBC 2)

SYNOPSIS:
While flying about in Starbug, Rimmer, Lister, Kryten, and  Cat come across
a mysterious  unscannable  light  entity  which  transfers  Rimmer  to  the
holoship Enlightenment, with a crew made up entirely of holograms.

Rimmer will advance in rank on  the holoship  if he  wins a  battle of wits
with a holo opponent. He adds two patches to his mind (from two of the most
intelligent people  from  Red  Dwarf's  hologram  store)  and becomes quite
smart, but a real pain in the arse.  Rimmer starts out doing very well, but
his mind  rejects  the  patches.   He  wins anyway,  only to  find out that
Nirvanah *let* him win, giving up her own  "life" so  Rimmer could advance.
Rimmer can't handle this and resigns.

TITLE:      The Inquisitor
AIR DATE:   2/27/92

SYNOPSIS:
The Inqusitor roams through time weeding  out life's  wastrels and deleting
the worthless - the Red Dwarf crew is  in big,  big trouble.   Kryten tells
the tale, oft repeated in space bars of 'The Inquisitor'.  He is a droid, a
self repairing Simulant who exists to  the end  of time  where he discovers
there is no God and no afterlife.  He decides that his purpose is to lead a
worthwhile life.  He constructs a time machine and  roams throught eternity
visiting every soul in history and assesses them.  Those  he considers have
wasted their  life  are erased  and replaced  by non-existing  people.  The
unfertilised eggs, the sperm that never made it.

Rimmer tries  to  blame  his  family  for  the  fact  that  he  is a slimy,
despicable, rat-hearted  green  discharge  of  a  man.    A  mad failed ex-
military father, a bitch queen of a mother and brothers with all the brains
and the looks.  He had  nothing, and  considering where  he is  now, he has
gone up in the world.

The Cat justifies himself by  tha fact  that he  has given  pleasure to the
whole world and because he has just such a great ass.  The  Judge calls him
a shallow guy for this justification.  The cat says yes, but  a shallow guy
with a great ass.

Kryten seems to be  ok because  he has  spent his  entire existence serving
others.  But Kryten disagrees, as the serving  is part  of his programming.
He is compelled and has no choice in the matter.  All he can put forward is
the breaking of his programming that Lister has made him do, to an extent.

To Lister, the Judge says, well get out of this smeghead.   You have brains
and you chose not to use them.  Lister's reply is 'spin on it'.

1.  BREAKAWAY Pilot/Debut: The "Mission Impossible" team of husband Martin
Landau and wife Barbara Bain is reunited in a series whose credibility is
heightened by authentic looking sets, Rudi Gernreich's costumes and, for
television, spectacular special effects.  On Moonbase Alpha, which monitors
lunar storage sites for atomic wastes shuttled from earth, Commander Koenig
and Dr.  Russel oversee an eleventh-hour attempt to avert spectacular
explosions on the moon that eventually hurtle it out of earth's orbit and
cast 311 men and women stationed on the moon on the ultimate journey into
space across the universe.

Later re-edited into the first half of the movie "Alien Attack"].

Strokes (Jim Haines), Alex Scott (Aarchon), Lawrence Trimble (Abrams)

Crawford), Wayne Brooks (Jackie)

11. GUARDIAN OF PIRI Guest Cast: Catherine Shell (Servant of the Guardian),
Michael Culver (Pete Irving) 

The Guardian of a tranquil and beautiful planet where machines do the bidding

                       Star Trek TOS/TAS Lists of Lists
                            compiled by Mark Holtz
                           (Revised April 4, 1994)

DISCLAIMER: "Star Trek", "Enterprise", and all other related items are
copyright and trademarks of Paramount Communications. Any infringement of
these lists on Paramount's legitimate copyright and trademarks is purely
unintentional, and will be corrected upon proper notification. These lists are
for the enjoyment of the reader only, and may not be sold.
   This is the Star Trek TOS/TAS List of Lists. It contains a listing of all
the episodes for both the original and the animated Star Trek TV series, plus
some added notes. (Due to the length considerations, there is a separate
Movies, TNG, and DS9 List of Lists). Regretibly, this is the final edition.
   If you are wondering why I compile these lists, it is strictly out of the
enjoyment of "Star Trek", and the wealth of information from other Star Trek
fans who post on the electronic networks. After being irritated by the
ever-constant requests for episode lists on Usenet, I decided in the middle of
1990 to post a list of episodes on a regular basis. It soon grew from that,
and, with the contributions of other people, these lists grew to what you see
today. (And they're still growing). The only payment I ask is thanks and
contributions. I am not making a dime off these compilations.

Did you know: In PDP-11 assembly language, there was a set of instructions
that were specifically implemented for making linked lists. A linked list is a
list that points to either another list or a piece of data. In the instruction
manuals I read, these were referred to as "lists of lists" (unless, of course,
the linked list pointed only to data). (Thanks to Paul Hoffman)

Episode synopsis by Edward Champion.

First Season
-==========-
  The pilot episode, "The Cage", was made as the first Star Trek pilot, which
was seen originally by NBC executives. They rejected that pilot, but asked for
a second pilot to be made ("Where No Man Has Gone Before"). Later on, in the
first season, production delays required that, in one week's time, two
episodes had to be made. Thus< "The Cage" was edited and made a part of "The
Menagerie". Only a black and white work print existed of scenes not used in
"The Menagerie." In 1986, it was released by Paramount Home Video as it was
releasing the entire TOS series on videocasette, which combined all related
color footage from "The Menagerie" and filled in all of the gaps with the
black and white print. (As a bonus, the tape included an introduction by Gene
Roddenberry). In 1988, as a filler episode for TNG due to a writer's strike,
Paramount aired "The Cage", with the black and white portions colorized, as
part of a two-hour progra
