Smileys

When you're involved in an online discussion, you can't see the smiles or shrugs
that the other person might make in a live conversation to show he's only
kidding.  But online, there's no body language. So what you might think is
funny, somebody else might take as an insult.  To try to keep such
misunderstandings from erupting into bitter disputes, we have smileys.  Tilt
your head to the left and look at the following sideways. :-).  Or simply
:).This is your basic "smiley." Use it to indicate people should not take that
comment you just made as seriously as they might otherwise.  You make a smiley
by typing a colon, a hyphen and a right parenthetical bracket. Some people
prefer using the word "grin," usually in this form:

<grin>

Sometimes, though, you'll see it as *grin* or even just <g> for short.Some other
smileys include:

 * ;-)
Wink;

 * :-(
Frown;

 * :-O
Surprise;

 * 8-)
Wearing glasses;

 * =|:-)=
Abe Lincoln.

OK, so maybe the last two are a little bogus :-), but for some really fancy
ones, see section The Unofficial Smiley Dictionary.
