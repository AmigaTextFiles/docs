During these last 21 years, the large Indonesian army has maintained a policy
of terror and complete genocide of the east timorese people. Massive human right violations have
caused the death of more than 250 000 people, which is about a third of the population.

These TV minutes were fundamental to call the public attention to the atrocities commited
in this territory.
With this event, the indonesian army strengthened even more the persecutions and arrests,
and in 20th November Xanana Gusmão, the timorese resistance leader, was arrested in Dili.

Despite these positive signs, the fight for freedom in East Timor isn't finished.
It is necessary that in the whole world, the supporters of Peace and of Human Rights,
