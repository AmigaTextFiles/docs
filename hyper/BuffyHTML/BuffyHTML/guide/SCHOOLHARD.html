The leaves are changing color, the air is cooler, it must be time for... the
Night of St. Vigius. Once again Buffy's life is in danger as the Master's
minions seek to gain extra power by killing Buffy during a sacred holiday. But
Buffy's mind is not on slaying. She and Sheila, a perpetually bad student,
have been threatened with expulsion by Principal Snyder. The only chance they
have of staying in school is to help organize Parent Teacher Night.<P>

While Buffy plans this evening, a new demon is in town -- Spike, a
200-year-old vampire who has actually killed two slayers over the past
century. Giles urges Buffy to take this challenge seriously, but she is
preoccupied with her school project and trying to cover for the never-present
Sheila.<P>

When Parent Teacher Night arrives, Buffy unsuccessfully tries to keep her
mother away from Principal Snyder. But things become a bit more serious when
Spike and some other vampires crash the event. The faculty, and Buffy's mom,
think these are just some gang kids on angel dust. Buffy convinces her mother
to stay hidden while she faces the vampires. Giles tries to help Buffy, whose
biggest worry is about her mother's safety. No- show Sheila finally arrives
and -- surprise! -- she's a vampire too. Angel tries to help by pretending
he's on Spike's side and offering up Xander's neck for a snack. Spike isn't
fooled and becomes enraged. Buffy continues to battle Spike until her mom's
maternal instincts overtake her fear and she whacks Spike with an axe. Spike
flees. Much to Buffy's relief, Mom is not angry about Principal Snyder's
assessment-- she's proud that Buffy is so resourceful and thoughtful of others
in a crisis.<P>

When Spike returns to the lair without having killed Buffy, the Anointed One
is angry. Spike throws the child into a cage and raises it up to the light.
Suddenly the cage is empty and we see only a puff of smoke, as Spike and his
main squeeze Drusilla go off to watch TV.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt's action-packed script, which takes it's title
from the classic Bruce Willis movie 'Die Hard', is primarily concerned with
introducing the two new main characters, and with establishing them as worthy
opponents for the Slayer. The comedy elements, most notably Buffy's efforts to
keep her mother and Principal Snyder apart, fall a little flat, but the wealth
of rich character-driven scenes more than compensates.<P>

There is growing friction between Xander and Angel, who have a number of
memorable scenes together. We are also reminded how easily Angel is able to
switch to the dark side.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

In this episode we discover that Principal Snyder and the authorities may know
a lot more about the Hellmouth and the supernatural forces gathering there
than was previously realised.<P>

We also find out the first names of two regular characters: Joyce Summers
(Buffy's mother), and Principal Bob Snyder.<P>
