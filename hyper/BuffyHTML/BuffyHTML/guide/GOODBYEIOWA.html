After Buffy details the events in the sewers, Spike suggests that Riley is
probably in on it. The others offer their own opinions, but Buffy refuses to
believe that Riley knew anything about Maggie's plot. As far as Maggie's
reasons go, they surmise that Buffy must have been getting too close to
something, such as the significance of 314. Deciding that all of their lives
are in danger from the Initiative, Buffy orders the gang to stay in Xander's
place for the time being. Just as Giles objects to this course of action,
Riley arrives at the apartment to see if Buffy is okay. Buffy tries to explain
what happened to her, but Riley has trouble buying the fact that Maggie or the
rest of Initiative is hiding something. However, Spike's presence distracts
Riley from the subject at hand. Finally recognizing the vampire, Riley turns
the tables on Buffy, demanding her excuse for harboring a known target of the
Initiative. Spike takes off, leaving Buffy and her friends to focus Riley on
the more important matter at hand. Still in denial, Riley leaves on his own.<P>

Emerging from the underground lab and onto the surface for the first time,
Adam slowly takes in his surroundings. Adam soon comes upon a lone young boy
in the woods. When the boy's curiosity falls on the bone skewer in Adam's left
arm, a knowing grin forms on the face of Maggie's creation. The next morning,
Buffy and the gang greet the new day with a news report on the television
regarding the brutal murder and mutilation of a young boy in the woods. When
the reporter mentions a skewer as the probably murder weapon, Buffy assumes
that Maggie sent the Polgara demon after her. Meanwhile, Dr. Angleman enters
the 314 lab and tries to find his way in the darkness. Slipping on a pool of
blood, Angleman immediately spots the body of Maggie Walsh. On the surface,
Forrest grills a returning Riley with inquiries regarding the previous night.
Taking Forrest into his room for privacy, Riley admits his conclusion that
Maggie tried to have Buffy killed. However, Forrest won't believe that
Maggie's reasons were anything but legitimate. Forrest goes on to express his
feeling that Buffy probably deserved whatever Maggie had in mind for her. Just
as their debate begins to heat up, Graham interrupts the scene with news of
Maggie's death.<P>

The sight of his murdered mentor is almost too much for Riley to bear, as
Forrest attributes her fatal wound to the act of a wooden stake. Seriously
disturbed by this accusation, Riley challenges Forrest. Dr. Angleman breaks
the two apart, demanding a moment of respect for their fallen comrade. Riley
and Forrest listen as Dr. Angelman mentions the recent escape of the Polgara
demon. Angleman then informs Riley and the rest of the team that the
government has ordered them to cease all operations until further
notification. Knowing that Dr. Angleman has no real authority over them, Riley
orders his troops to patrol the entire town of Sunnydale and permanently
eliminate the Polgara demon. At the cemetery, Forrest and Graham inspect
Spike's crypt, but they leave without locating the vampire's hidden resting
place. Buffy, in the meantime, arrives at the crime scene to search for any
traces of the Polgara demon's trail. Riley arrives shortly and informs Buffy
of Maggie's death. Back at UC Sunnydale, Willow stops by Tara's room.<P>

After they discuss the spells they performed all-night recently, Willow
suggests that they perform another spell, one that would conjure the goddess
Thespia to locate any demonic energy in the area. After constructing a basic
map of the town on the floor, Willow pours a handful of the potion into her
hand and Tara's. While Willow blows her portion onto the map as the spell
requires them to do so, Tara stashes her handful of the potion under her bed.
When Willow opens her eyes, she believes that the spell was a total failure.<P>

Meanwhile, Buffy pays a visit to Willy's bar, hoping to get some information
on the whereabouts of the Polgara demon. However, Willy hasn't heard anything
about the demon since it was originally captured by Buffy and the Initiative.
As Buffy turns her line of questioning to the Initiative and 314, Riley walks
in and immediately spots Buffy.<P>

Further confused by Buffy's apparent socialization with demons, Riley demands
answers from the Slayer. Buffy notices the uncontrollable trembling in Riley's
hands, which forcefully grab her by the shoulders. When a woman tries to leave
the scene, Riley draws his gun and levels it at the frightened patron's head.
Buffy and Willy try to talk him out of it, but Riley cannot manage to
distinguish right from wrong, good from bad, anymore.<P>

Finally, Riley lowers his gun and slumps onto the counter, allowing the
terrified woman to make a hasty exit. After Buffy brings him back to Xander's
apartment, Riley struggles to understand what is happening to him. As Riley
declares the loss of everything he's ever held to be true, Buffy notices a
crimson rash on his hand. Riley's nails continuously scratch at the rash, and
Buffy pulls his hands apart. Pulling a scarf from her hair, Buffy wraps the
garment over Riley's wounded hand before getting him to rest. By the laundry
machines, Giles and Anya tell Buffy of the inconsistencies between the young
boy's murder and the documented behavioral patterns of the Polgara demon.
Suspicious of Riley's deteriorating physical condition, Buffy believes that
there is more to it than grief. She asks Xander to accompany her on an
investigation of the Initiative laboratory.<P>

After Buffy passes the retinal scan and gains entrance to the main elevator,
she changes into a scientist's lab coat and glasses while Xander wears the
fatigues he's been keeping in his basement. As they roam through the facility,
Buffy and Xander overhear a conversation between Dr. Angleman and another
scientist. According to them, the Initiative soldiers have been fed
performance-enhancing chemicals unknowingly through their food. Since Riley
dispatched the team that morning, the soldiers have been experiencing severe
withdrawal. Most of the soldiers have returned to the lab, but Dr. Angleman
insists that they find Riley soon, due to his vital importance to their
project.<P>

Back at Giles' apartment, Riley abruptly gets out of bed and asks for Buffy.
When he realizes that Buffy has infiltrated the Initiative, Riley gets dressed
and heads for the stairs. Willow tries to block off his exit, but Riley shoves
her to the floor and heads up the stairs. In the lab, Buffy and Xander follow
Dr. Angleman through a security door and confront him inside the room. When
Dr. Angleman tries to warn Buffy that her presence has probably been alerted
to security by now, Riley appears with news that the security monitors are
currently off-line. Buffy turns her attention back to Angleman, who confesses
that Maggie was responsible for the attack on the Slayer. When Dr. Angelman
begins to reveal the details of Project 314, Riley decides that he's heard
enough and doesn't want Maggie's memory to be tainted by these accusations.
Buffy tries to convince him that she's only after the truth, but Riley's
psychosis has reached the point where he believes his own girlfriend is
responsible for everything that has happened recently. Before their argument
can escalate, the body of a soldier hits the floor not too far from where they
are standing. Buffy, Riley, Xander, and Dr. Angleman look up to see Adam, who
has returned to his place of creation.<P>

Dropping down to the floor below, Adam pulls from his pocket a stack of
computer disks that he retrieved from the lab. Inserting them into a disk
drive in his chest one by one, Adam recalls files that detail his own
existence as a &quot;kinematically redundant, biomechanical demonoid&quot;. After
inserting a disk labeled &quot;Finn&quot;, Adam tells Riley how the two of them are
connected in the eyes of the late Maggie Walsh. While Maggie literally
constructed Adam with various parts of humans, demons, and machines, Professor
Walsh was also responsible for creating Riley. Although Riley has a true
biological family in Iowa, it wasn't until he met Maggie Walsh that he started
his path to becoming the soldier that he is today, due in part to the
chemicals that he was fed daily. When Adam offers to disclose the full scope
of Maggie's plan for the two of them, Riley puts a stop to the back story by
aiming his gun at the creature. In a blinding instant, Adam shoves the gun
aside, knocks Buffy to the floor, and sends Riley flying across the room with
a thunderous punch. After flooring Xander easily, Adam extracts his bone
skewer and drives it through a fleeing Angleman, who dies instantly. Riley
makes another attempt to fight, but Adam quickly stabs the soldier's torso
with his bloody skewer. Down for the count, Riley can only watch as Buffy
tries her hand at fighting Adam. Unfortunately, her blows have virtually no
effect on Adam, who crushes her to the floor once again. As the rest of the
Initiative squad tries to bust into the room, Adam escapes through a ceiling
vent. Just as his feet disappear into the shaft, the rest of the team barges
in, completely unaware of the departed Adam. Riley confirms Buffy's story that
Adam was responsible for his own injury as well as Dr. Angleman's murder.
While the troops launch a search for the creature, Forrest orders Buffy to
back off and let them take Riley to a military hospital.<P>

Elsewhere, Spike waltzes in to Willy's bar for a drink. However, Spike gets a
greeting in the form of a severe beating from several of the demon patrons.
Disgusted with Spike's apparent alliance with the Slayer, the demons threaten
the vampire outcast with a merciless death if he doesn't wise up soon. The
next morning, Buffy and Willow try to figure out what to do about Adam, while
also wondering about Riley's fate. Buffy fears that her boyfriend is
completely alone in the Initiative infirmary, but such is not the case, for
Riley still has her scarf wrapped around his hand to motivate a quick
recovery.<P>
