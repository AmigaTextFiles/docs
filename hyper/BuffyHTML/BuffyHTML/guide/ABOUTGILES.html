Rupert Giles attended college in Oxford where he fell into dubious company,
and began practising in the black arts. He then followed the family tradition
and became a Watcher.<P>

Before being sent to Sunnydale to supervise Buffy's training, Giles worked in
&quot;a British museum.&quot; His job as the school librarian affords plenty of
opportunity to immerse himself in ancient tomes of prophecy, unravelling the
obscure riddles which might help protect his protégé. Giles was assigned to
Buffy when her previous Watcher was killed, and she was forced to relocate.
Although they have a quirky relationship, their loyalty and respect for each
other is obvious.<P>

Giles is not a natural fighter but has demonstrated incredible fortitude under
trying circumstances. A shy romantic, his slow-burning relationship with
colleague Jenny Calendar belies a passionate soul. Giles is often the group's
mediator and is certainly the voice of authority. A man of hidden talents (he
speaks five languages, and plays the guitar) Giles is best not
underestimated.<P>

Blessed with a typically dry, British, sense of humour and irony, Giles is
often bewildered by the student's hip lingo. However his time with the
Slayerettes, and with Jenny, is slowly but surely mellowing him.<P>

Anthony Stewart Head has enjoyed a successful acting career in his native
England for many years, but it was a popular series of coffee commercials that
brought him his greatest recognition in the United States. Head starred as the
intriguing romantic lead in a dozen Taster's Choice commercials, each tracing
the budding romance between two neighbors who share a love for the same
coffee. <P>

Head was a regular cast member on the sci-fi television series &quot;VR.5.&quot; He also
guest-starred on the series &quot;Highlander&quot; and the critically acclaimed police
drama &quot;NYPD Blue.&quot; Additional credits include the Showtime movie &quot;Royce&quot; with
Jim Belushi; and the feature films &quot;A Prayer for the Dying,&quot; &quot;Devil's Hill&quot;
and &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover.&quot; <P>

He has performed in several BBC Productions, including &quot;Secret Army,&quot;
&quot;Accident,&quot; &quot;Bergerac,&quot; &quot;The Grudge Fight,&quot; &quot;Howard's Way&quot; and &quot;Pulaski.&quot; Head
also starred in the British television productions &quot;Enemy at the Door&quot; and
&quot;Love in a Cold Climate.&quot; <P>

Head was born in Camdentown, England, and grew up in Hampton. He attended the
London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, and got his first show business
break playing Jesus in &quot;Godspell.&quot; He went on to star in a number of West End
theater productions, including &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show,&quot; &quot;Julius
Caesar,&quot; &quot;The Heiress,&quot; &quot;Chess,&quot; Peter Shaffer's &quot;Yonadab&quot; at the Royal
National Theater, and &quot;Rope.&quot; <P>

He is currently working on the adult animated feature film in development
&quot;Dark Secrets,&quot; which he co-wrote. <P>

Head divides his time between homes in Los Angeles and England.
