Buffy, in an attempt to bring some normality into her complicated life,
decides to try out for cheerleader. When she goes to the big tryout, she meets
a quiet girl named Amy. As one girl auditions, she gets more and more into her
routine, and suddenly her hands begin to smoke. Buffy knocks her to the ground
and puts the girl's smoking hands out. Amy tells Buffy that her mother was a
cheerleading star and she feels pressure to make the squad. When Amy leaves,
Willow says it's a lot more than pressure -- she thinks Amy's mom is a tyrant.
Neither Amy nor Buffy is chosen as part of the regular squad -- both are
alternates. Amy is distraught when she is only chosen to be third alternate --
with Buffy as first alternate.<P>

In a spooky attic with a cauldron, someone is casting spells with dolls. The
next day, snooty Cordelia Chase, who has made cheerleader, is temporarily
blinded while taking her driving test. Giles thinks Amy's a witch, but the
only way to prove it is to form a potion and pour it on her -- if her skin
turns blue, she is a witch. Buffy, Xander and Willow join forces to test this
theory in chemistry class, and Giles is proven correct. Then another
cheerleader has a mysterious accident, and when Amy reacts to it with horror,
it makes Buffy doubt whether Amy realizes what she's doing. Amy comes home in
a huff to find her mother on the couch watching TV. She tells her mother to
write her history report. We see that Amy is holding an ID bracelet which
Xander gave Buffy for good luck at the cheerleading tryouts -- Buffy will be
Amy's next victim.<P>

As first alternate, Buffy is now on the cheerleading squad, and starts acting
strangely during practice. When she tosses another cheerleader across the
room, it's time for the next alternate to come in -- Amy. Buffy suddenly
becomes weak, and Giles says the only way to keep her from dying is to get
Amy's spell book. Willow and Xander stay at school to keep an eye on Amy.
Giles and Buffy force their way into Amy's house, and Buffy discovers that the
woman they're speaking to is not really Amy's mother but Amy herself. The
mother switched their bodies so she could relive her glory days as a
cheerleader. Giles finds the spell book, and they all troop off to school,
where &quot;Amy&quot; is getting ready to cheer. As Giles chants, &quot;Amy&quot; becomes weaker
as the transformation begins. &quot;Amy&quot; charges out of the gym to find Buffy and
kill her. Just as she's about to get her, the transformation is complete.
&quot;Amy&quot; is now the real Amy, and the mother goes berserk. She starts to cast an
evil spell on Buffy, but Buffy deflects it with a mirror and sends it back to
the mother, who disappears. Everything seems to be back to normal, until we
catch a glimpse of the mother's cheerleader trophy in a school display case.
Its eyes are moving...<P>

<B>More information</B><P>

An episode featuring Sunnydale High's cheerleaders was an obvious one, but
here it's given a typical Buffy The Vampire Slayer spin to create something
more unusual than you might find under similar circumstances in other
teen-based shows. The allusions to the cheerleaders being a cult are
particularly pleasing. Sadly, it's a rather predictable episode, blessed with
only one significant plot twist. The first signs of the Buffy / Willow /
Xander love triangle appear here. Xander is becoming besotted with Buffy,
whilst sidelining Willow with the unintentionally dismissive &quot;you're my guy
for the knows-about-girls stuff.&quot; Dana Reston's script doesn't sparkle like
Whedon's two episodes, and often lacks subtlety. One element that does work
well is the contrast between Buffy's relationship with her mother, and Amy and
hers.<P>

The depiction of witchcraft, replete with bubbling cauldrons and voodoo dolls,
is surely a rather Hollywood concoction, reminiscent of the pseudo-magic in
movies like 'The Craft'. The results are rather gruesome but well within the
usual television restrictions: Amber's hands erupting into flame; Cordelia's
blindness; and their classmate struck dumb are all rather simply accomplished,
but nonetheless effective. Cordelia is given her first real exposure here,
(following her brief introduction in <A href=WELCOMETOHELLMOUTH.html>Welcome To The Hellmouth</A>), in a nice
character-building scene. When Giles asks &quot;Why would someone want to harm
Cordelia?&quot;, Willow has one suggestion: &quot;Because they met her?&quot;<P>

The best scenes, though, belong to the light-headed Buffy, who must be great
fun at a party!<P>

Pop Culture: There's a reference to the Nickelodeon TV program 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' by Buffy: &quot;The test was positive, she's our Sabrina.&quot;

<B>Chris's Notes</B>
<P>
On the BBC website and (I think) the Buffy Website, this episode is named 'The Witch' (hence its name in this guide)... but according to the season one box-set the title is simply 'Witch'.
