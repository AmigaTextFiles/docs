Police and paramedics are on the scene at the Summers' house, investigating
the aftermath of Buffy and Faith's battle. Faith is brought out on a stretcher
as a detective thanks Buffy for somehow knocking her unconscious. When he
calls Faith a kid though, Buffy becomes defensive and retorts that she's
tougher than he thinks. Faith has obviously transferred her spirit into
Buffy's body with the Mayor's amulet.<P>

Back in the living room, Joyce can't understand why her &quot;daughter&quot; is acting
so cold and shallow. She can't even bring herself to hug Joyce. Faith, in her
new body, retires to take a bath and explore herself. She looks in the mirror
and practices acting as Buffy-like as possible. For the most part she overdoes
it though and ends up looking foolish.<P>

The real Buffy wakes up in the hospital in Faith's body. When she tries to go
save her mother, the police restrain her and load her full of sedatives. Back
in Tara's room, she and Willow discuss their &quot;relationship&quot;. Willow explains
that she hasn't introduced her to her friends yet because she likes to have
something that is just hers. Tara reassures her that she is hers. Meanwhile,
Faith goes through Buffy's room and tries on her clothes. When she comes
across Buffy's wallet, she orders a flight for 10 am the next morning. Joyce
informs her that Giles and the gang are waiting to meet her at Giles'. Faith
decides she wouldn't mind seeing what her enemies are up to and leaves to head
over. The real Buffy is simultaneously waking up again, this time in the
backseat of a police car. Suddenly, the police car is rammed by an armored
truck and the cops knocked unconscious. The same men who met at the hospital
after Faith came out of her coma, jump out of the back of the vehicle. They
smash the police car window and drag the girl they think is Faith, out. The
stone-faced men inform her that she is under arrest in the name of the
Watcher's Council.<P>

Back at Giles' house, Faith enters and greets the unwitting gang. Giles
informs them that &quot;Faith&quot; has been extracted to England by a Council Retrieval
Team. When Willow announces her repulsion of Faith, Faith does everything she
can to act natural and restrain from killing Buffy's friend. That night, Faith
takes advantage of her new sexy body, by cutting a rug at the Bronze. She runs
into Spike who just assumes it is the same old Buffy. But instead of her
normal righteous self, this Buffy rubs against Spike, titillating him. She
tells him she could &quot;have him&quot; if she wanted and then leaves him frustrated,
angry, and thirsty for revenge. Elsewhere, a group of marauding vampires enter
their lair to find Adam waiting for them. When one of them attacks, Adam
easily defends himself, tearing the vamp's head clean off. He tells the other
four bloodsuckers that he has a plan to help them unite.<P>

Under the guard of the Watcher Retrieval Team, Buffy tries to convince the men
that she's not Faith. The less-than-professional soldiers just mock and spit
on her. Back at the Bronze, Willow and Tara arrive to hang out. Willow sees
&quot;Buffy&quot; and decides to finally introduce her to Tara. Faith decides to have a
little fun with Tara when Willow leaves them alone to get a drink and mocks
the apparent feelings she has for her Wicken companion. Suddenly, Willow
returns and points out a vampire leaving the club with an oblivious girl.
Faith, forced to act as Buffy would, leaves in pursuit. She slays the vampire
in the parking lot with a broken pool cue and helps the girl to her feet. When
the shaken young lady thanks her sincerely for saving her life, Faith seems to
feel good about it for a split second. When she returns inside, Willow says
that she is taking her friend home because she isn't feeling well. When she
mentions Riley, Faith decides to leave too and pay Buffy's boyfriend a visit.<P>

When Willow and Tara arrive at Tara's room, they discuss &quot;Buffy's&quot; behavior.
Tara feels that the energy she gave off was fragmented and Buffy couldn't have
been her normal self. The two Wickens decide to perform a ritual that opens a
passage to the netherworld where Willow could visit Buffy's body on an astral
plane and investigate her inner self. Meanwhile, the outer self of Buffy is
busy turning Riley on. When Faith gets a little too kinky though, Riley starts
to suspect something is wrong with his normally conservative girlfriend.
Before he can question her, Faith seals his lips with a more romantic kiss.
Later, when they rest in a post coital embrace, Willow and Tara's ritual
begins to take effect. Surrounded by a ring of energy, Willow's spirit leaves
her body and enters Buffy's. Faith rolls out of bed and questions the other
inhabitant of Buffy's body. Riley watches confused as his girlfriend argues
with herself schizophrenically. Faith seems to finally suppress Willow's
intrusion and return to bed.<P>

In a subterranean cave, Adam lectures to his new pupils. He wants to use his
small vampire posse to spread the word of his coming apocalyptic attack on
humanity. The next morning, Faith leaves Riley's room before he wakes up. On
her way out the door, Forrest confronts her about disturbing Riley while he
recovers from his injuries. When he criticizes her profession by calling her a
killer, Faith finds herself defending what Buffy does. Confused about why
being called a killer offended her, she storms out the door to catch her
flight. At the shipyard, Buffy makes a flight of her own. When one of the
guards reaches a tranquilizer gun into her room, she grabs it with her feet
and kicks the guard in the head. After a couple more slick moves, she jumps
into the driver's seat of the armored truck they picked her up in and drives
it through the front of the shipyard warehouse. When she shows up at Giles'
house in Faith's body, her ex-Watcher is understandably shocked. To prove it
is her, Buffy lists things that only she could possibly know about Giles, like
the fact that he had sex with her mom. Just then Willow and Tara show up. They
show Buffy and Giles a Katra they conjured which is a small, glowing green orb
they have in a charm box. Willow explains that all they have to do is bring
Buffy and Faith together to employ the Katra which will switch their spirits
back to their rightful bodies. Suddenly they notice a breaking newscast on
Giles' television. A group of citizens are being held hostage in a church by
unknown assailants. At the airport, Faith is watching the same newscast.<P>

Inside the church, the vampires that Adam took under his wing are the ones
tormenting the frightened Sunnydale locals. When Faith shows up outside, she
runs into Riley who still thinks she is Buffy. When she tells him she wants to
go inside and do some slaying, Riley tries to stop her from entering alone.
Faith shrugs him off and goes in anyway, driven by some force to help the
innocent people inside. She takes on Adam's followers in a grueling fight that
rumbles throughout the church. After slaying three of them she is pinned down
by the leader. Out of nowhere, Buffy stakes him from behind. But rather than
thanking her, Faith attacks Buffy. After a knuckle-splitting flurry, Buffy is
able to grab Faith's hand and switch their bodies back with the power of the
Katra. Faith, now in her original body, jumps up and runs out of the church.
Later, in Riley's room, Buffy explains to him what happened. She is angry to
find out that Riley unknowingly slept with Faith, but relieved with the
knowledge that she probably won't be returning for a while. Meanwhile,
somewhere far away, Faith somberly rides across the countryside in the boxcar
of a train she apparently hopped leaving Sunnydale.<P>
