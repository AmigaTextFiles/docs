In the Middle Ages, a young man approaches a horned demon, who smiles at him
and then breaks his neck. Later, a group of monks, outraged by the deed, chant
in Latin, open a book and the demon is sucked into it -- its pages now
filled.<P>

Back in the library, Buffy opens a crate and finds the long forgotten book.
Along with Xander and Willow, the school's two computer experts are helping
scan books: Fritz, a menacing looking bruiser, and Dave, a geekier kid. Also
present is Miss Calendar, the computer science teacher, who rides Giles about
his fear of technology. As Willow scans the ancient book, the characters
disappear from its pages. When she looks away, words appear on the screen:
&quot;Where am I?&quot;<P>

A week later, Willow tells Buffy about Malcolm, a boy she's having an online
romance with. Buffy, worried about her naive friend enlists Dave's help to try
to find out more about Malcolm. Dave tells Buffy to leave Willow alone.
Meanwhile, Miss Calendar stumbles upon the ancient book and asks Giles about
its blank pages. When Giles notices the horned demon on the cover, he suspects
trouble. Dave gets Buffy to look for Willow in the girls' locker room but when
she gets there, Fritz has rigged up some wires in the shower to try to
electrocute her. A puddle reaches the exposed wires and Buffy is sent flying
into the locker room -- the soles of her shoes smoldering. A shaken Dave tells
the computer he can't kill Buffy. Angry at his disrespect, it types up a
suicide note for him. Back in the library, Giles explains to Buffy and Xander
that in the Dark Ages, the souls of demons were sometimes trapped in certain
volumes, where they remained harmless until the pages were read aloud. When
Willow scanned them, the demon, Moloch, was unleashed into the computer, and
now has access to any computer in the world. Moloch preys on impressionable
minds, which makes both Fritz and Dave vulnerable to his power. Buffy tries to
delete Willow's files, hoping to &quot;delete&quot; Moloch along with them, but Moloch
appears on the screen warning Buffy to stay away from Willow.<P>

Looking for Willow in the computer lab, she finds Dave's body hanging, with
the suicide note pinned to it. Fritz goes to Willow's house, chloroforms her
and brings her to a mysterious warehouse where Dave had been spotted earlier.
A desperate Giles asks Miss Calendar for help and discovers she has extensive
knowledge of the mystical realm. She helps him repeat the spell the monks had
chanted while she links up a configuration of different computers around the
world.<P>

Meanwhile, Buffy and Xander try to save Willow at the warehouse. By the time
they arrive, Moloch has left the computer and appears as a robotic incarnation
of the horned demon that was back in the Dark Ages. He breaks Fritz' neck and
is about to break Willow's when the spell takes hold, immobilizing him.
Injured, but fighting, he lunges at Buffy, but she ducks and he punches a
high-voltage junction box and dies of electrocution.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

Although the plot is rather tired and seems to belong to the
Cyberspace-obsessed eighties, it's given a unique Buffy The Vampire Slayer
spin or three to create a very satisfying episode. There's an excellent
pre-credits teaser which contrasts very nicely with the technological elements
later in the episode.<P>

&quot;I Robot...&quot; has a nice underlying message about the dissemination of
information and how technology threatens to replace the printed word. Given
later developments, it's surprising that Miss Calendar would advocate
replacing books with data. Giles sums it up nicely: &quot;If it's to last, the
getting of knowledge should be tangible&quot;.<P>

Willow gets a raw deal in an episode that centres on the character. It seems
that her relationships both inside and outside the group are ill-fated. Alyson
Hannigan gives a great performance in the first episode that gives her
something meaningful to do.<P>

The two versions of Moloch, the lizard-like original and the scrap metal
variation, are superbly executed, imposing and magisterial. Making the library
an integral element of the plot, rather than just somewhere where the gang
congregate to chew the fat, is a refreshing change.<P>

<B>Chris's Notes</B><P>

Don't bother spending too long pausing your videos to get a glimpse at Buffy's birthdate (you thought I was gonna say ass, didn't you!)... two seperate dates are shown on-screen during the episode, 05/06/79 and 10/24/80. I don't know if her birth date is available anywhere (I probably wouldn't know if it was in this guide) but these probably weren't meant to be noticed.
