Buffy Summers surprises her friends with her S.A.T. scores, which are a
combined total of 1430. While everybody is fairly excited by this news, Buffy
herself is more concerned with the fact that she may have to consider her
future more seriously. Later that night, a car runs over the welcome sign at
Sunnydale's city limits. Completely drunk, a familiar figure tumbles out of
the driver's side door: Spike. Spike heads to the burnt-out factory where he
originally stayed with Drusilla before Giles' invasion forced them to leave.
Spike laments over his recent break-up with Dru as he smashes one of her old
dolls.<P>

The next morning, Xander convinces Cordelia to join Oz and Willow on a double
date at the bowling alley. Xander notices that Cordy has taped pictures of
herself and Xander, along with Oz and Willow, to the inside of her locker
door. After confirming the plans, Oz follows Willow to her locker and gives
her a pez dispenser with a witch's head on it as an impromptu gift. Overcome
with guilt, Willow confronts Xander outside and tries to convince him that the
double date is a bad idea. In the library, Giles admires Buffy's S.A.T. scores
while he finishes packing for a retreat at Breaker's Woods. Buffy mentions her
mother's enthusiasm and encouragement to apply to major colleges across the
country.<P>

Giles agrees that Buffy should take advantage of this opportunity, while Faith
could keep an eye on Sunnydale. Elsewhere, the deputy mayor informs Mayor
Wilkins that Spike is back in town. Mayor Wilkins agrees with his suggestion
that they get Mr. Trick to send a vampire committee to take care of Spike.
Later, after school, Buffy and Joyce discuss college plans. Joyce continuously
mentions out-of-state universities. Meanwhile, Spike goes to the Crawford
Street mansion and spies on Angel, who is reading a book inside. Still drunk,
Spike passes out on the floor of the garden.<P>

As the sun rises the next morning, Spike is abruptly woken up by the sight and
pain of his burning hand, which has been ignited by the sunlight. He goes to a
local magic shop in search of a curse to cast on Angel. Spike hides as Willow
enters. He looks on as Willow buys a few ingredients for a de-lusting spell,
which she hopes will put an end to her affair with Xander. After Willow
leaves, Spike feeds on the shopkeeper and formulates a new plan to get what he
wants. At the mansion, Angel tells Buffy that she should look into college.
This causes Buffy to leave early. Later that night, Xander finds Willow
working on some sort of experiment in the science lab. While they wait for
Cordelia and Oz to meet them there for the double date, Xander realizes that
Willow is actually performing a spell. She tells him about the nature of the
spell, and Xander is not pleased with Willow's preferred method of dealing
with their situation. Suddenly, Spike appears to kidnap Willow. While Xander
fights Spike, Willow attempts to hit the vampire with a heavy object. Spike
grabs it out of Willow's hands and strikes Xander directly in the head,
knocking him out. Willow and Xander are then brought to the factory and locked
in the basement. While Xander lays on a bed, unconscious and bloody, Spike
demands Willow to perform a love spell that will bring Drusilla back to him.
Willow tells Spike that she still needs a few additional ingredients and the
right spell book. Back at Sunnydale High, Cordy and Oz barge into the library
where Buffy is training. Worried about Xander and Willow's absence, they take
Buffy to the science lab and show her the aftermath of the fight. Buffy sends
them to find Giles at his retreat while she goes back to the library to
properly equip herself for the search. Before Buffy can enter the bookcage,
the phone rings. It's Joyce, and as Buffy listens, Spike enters the Summers'
home. As soon as Buffy hears the familiar voice, she drops the phone and runs
home as fast as she can.<P>

Joyce makes a couple cups of coffee while Spike tells her his sob story about
what happened between himself and Drusilla. Outside, Angel approaches the
house. He sees Spike sitting at the kitchen counter with Joyce and tries to
run into the house, but can't do so without an invitation. Joyce is terrified
to see Angel again, unaware that the real enemy is standing right behind her.
Distracted, Spike doesn't even notice Buffy's entrance as she grabs him from
behind and pins him to the counter. Joyce watches in confusion while Buffy
invites Angel into the house to help with Spike. Spike tells them what he's
done with Willow and Xander, but he doesn't say where they are. Buffy and
Angel reluctantly agree to help Spike get what he needs for the love spell in
exchange for her friends' safety.<P>

Meanwhile, Oz picks up Willow's scent, so he cancels the drive to Breaker's
Woods and tries to find Willow and Xander instead. Cordelia is not too
comfortable with the fact that Oz still has a few latent werewolf abilities
even when it's not that time of the month. Buffy and Angel follow Spike to the
magic shop to get the ingredients. While there, Spike mocks Buffy and Angel's
attempt to be nothing more than friends. Spike insists that they will forever
be in love with each other, just like he is with Dru. At the factory, Xander
finally comes to and learns from Willow everything that's happened. Realizing
that their situation is seemingly hopeless, Xander and Willow lay on the bed
and kiss, unaware of the fact that Oz and Cordelia have just arrived to rescue
them. Nobody can believe what they're seeing, and Cordy takes it the hardest.
As she runs back up the stairs, one of the deteriorated steps crumbles. Cordy
falls through the hole to the hard floor below. When Xander looks down through
the hole, he sees that Cordy is impaled on a steel rod, which is sticking up
from her torso.<P>

After gathering all of the ingredients, Spike, Buffy, and Angel run into a
large group of vampires outside of the magic shop. One of the group's head
vampires, Lenny, is not too pleased with Spike's return to Sunnydale. A huge
battle erupts on the street.<P>

Outnumbered, the three retreat into the magic shop and seal off the entrances.
They miss one of the doors in the back, which is soon opened by the invading
vampires. As the battle spills into the magic shop, Spike drives a stake
through Lenny's heart, reducing him to dust. More vampires bust through the
window, but they are quickly thwarted off by the vials of holy water thrown by
Buffy and Angel. Spike is thoroughly satisfied with the emotional rush from
the battle, and decides to forget about the love spell and win Drusilla back
by being his old self. Spike tells them that Willow and Xander are at the
factory, then leaves. Meanwhile, at the factory, Xander climbs down to the
injured Cordelia while Oz leaves to get help. Luckily, none of Cordy's organs
were punctured by the rod, but her distress over Xander's betrayal is beyond
repair. While Buffy comforts Willow about the whole situation, Xander tries
his own luck at the hospital where Cordy is recovering. He brings her flowers
and tries to apologize, but Cordy simply tells Xander to stay away. Later,
Buffy goes to the mansion and tells Angel that she won't visit him anymore.
Buffy can't get out of her mind what Spike said about the two of them, so she
decides to break off her contact with Angel. While everybody somberly reflects
to themselves about what happened during the past few days, a jubilant Spike
leaves Sunnydale once again.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</b>
<P>
Dan Vebber, making an auspicious "Buffy" writing debut, helps to restore things to normal after some recent out-of-character anomalies (Willow's reluctance to help research and Xander's spiteful attitude in "Revelations", for example). There is still some amusing unfulfilled attraction between Xander and Willow to work through, but otherwise things are just peachy.
<P>
There's been very little interaction so far between Buffy and this season's arch villains (the Mayor and Mister Trick, in case you were wondering), so the return of Spike is a very welcome development. Here we get to see a whole new side of Spike, whose drunken, lovelorn ramblings make him more sympathetic than ever. His scenes with Willow and Joyce, in which he recounts his sob story, are well-written and beautifully performed. "She wouldn't even kill me. She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head or set me on fire!".
<P>
This is undeniably Spike's episode, culminating in a terrific speech that undermines Buffy's and Angel's relationship, while defending his hopeless love for Drusilla: "You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, children. It's blood, blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it".
<P>
<B>Trivia</B>
<P>
Xander's wariness of Willow's spell casting is well founded: he had been on the wrong end of her love spell in "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered".
<P>
According to the "Welcome to Sunnydale" sign that Spike knocks over at the beginning of this episode, Sunnydale's population is 38,500 (and, no doubt, getting smaller all the time...)
<P>
Pop Culture: Willow's lament that her test scores make her "Cletus, the Slack-Jawed Yokel" refers to a simpleton character in "The Simpsons", who first appeared in the 1994 episode "Bart Gets an Elephant". Cletus is married to his sister, Brandine. They have 26 children and a "smellhound" called Geech. Cletus even got his own theme song in the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield": "Some folks'll never eat a skunk / but then some folks'll / like Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel"!
