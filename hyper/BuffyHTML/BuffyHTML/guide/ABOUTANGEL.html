Angel was born early in the eighteenth century. By 1753 he was living in
Galway, as a drunkard and womaniser. There he was made a vampire by Darla,
and, as &quot;Angelus&quot;, subsequently travelled Europe, leaving a trail of
destruction in his wake, more than earning The Master's description of him as
&quot;The most vicious creature I ever met.&quot;
<P>
When Angel first encountered <A href=ABOUTBUFFY.html>Buffy</A>, it was as a shadowy advisor who warned her
about The Master's plan to escape. It wasn't until <A href=ANGEL.html>Angel</A> that he revealed his
true form to Buffy. Tending to his wounds after a skirmish with three
vampires, Angel tells Buffy he's an orphan, and that vampires killed his
parents &quot;a long while ago&quot;. He warns that they should not become involved, but
they kiss, and Angel morphs into vampire form, and flees. Later Buffy
confronts him, her feelings in turmoil, and Angel admits that he killed his
family: &quot;for a hundred years I offered an ugly death to everyone I met&quot;. Giles
cautions Buffy against falling in love with Angel, to no avail, although he
does admit that the Slayer falling in love with a vampire is &quot;poetic&quot;.
<P>
Angel's reign of terror ended when he killed a young gypsy girl offered to him
by Darla. The girl's family cursed him by restoring his soul, making it
impossible for him to kill again. In <A href=SURPRISE.html>Surprise</A> it is revealed that Jenny
Calendar was sent to Sunnydale by the gypsy tribe to make sure that Angel
never experiences one moment of happiness: if he does, his soul will vanish
again, and his evil nature will take control again. Despite Jenny's
attentions, Angel and Buffy spend a fateful night together. Angel awakens in
pain: he has crossed to the dark side again, and teams up with Spike and
Drusilla, crushing Buffy's love in the process.
