"Sorry Jenny... This is where you get off." - Angel
<P>
Buffy wakes up in the morning to discover a piece of paper sitting on her
pillow. She unfolds it to discover a sketch of her face while she was
sleeping. Buffy knows that Angel must have been in her bedroom during her
sleep. At the library, Buffy pleads to Giles that he find a spell that would
reverse the invitation into her home. Buffy and Giles then stop by Jenny
Calendar's computer class to meet Willow, who has just been assigned by Jenny
to fill in as class teacher the next day for the first few minutes. As Buffy
and Willow leave, Jenny does her best to apologize to Giles, who insists that
Buffy is the one who deserves the apology. Jenny also gives Giles a book that
she has been reading since Angel lost his soul.<P>

That night, Buffy tells her mother during dinner that Angel has been sort of
stalking her lately. Buffy asks Joyce to never invite him into the house.
Later, Buffy talks to Willow over the phone. During their conversation, Willow
notices an envelope on her bed. She opens it and discovers that all the fish
from her aquarium have been removed and strung along a wire, which she slowly
pulls out of the envelope. Willow quickly retreats to Buffy's house to spend
the night.<P>

At the factory the next morning, Spike grows increasingly tired of Angel's
presence. Their argument is interrupted by Drusilla, who falls onto the table
in pain, for she senses something going on that may endanger them. What she
senses is Jenny's visit to the local craft shop. Jenny purchases an Orb of
Thesulah which she needs to restore Angel's soul. The shopkeeper warns her
that the transliteration annals have been lost for many years, but Jenny tells
him that she's working on a computer program that could translate the text.
The next morning, Giles gives Jenny's book to Buffy and points out the
revoking spell that he just found. Buffy and Willow first help Cordy perform
the steps on her car. The three of them then perform the spell in Willow's
house. While there, Cordy notices a piece of paper left on Willow's bed.
Willow unfolds it, then hands it to Buffy. It is a sketch of Joyce, asleep and
completely unaware of Angel's presence. Buffy and Willow race to her house to
perform the spell. Joyce soon pulls into the driveway, where Angel waits for
her to get out of the car. Angel pleads with Joyce to help him get Buffy back,
and he eventually mentions the night they made love. Joyce finally unlocks the
front door and enters the house. Angel tries to follow her in, but a force
holds him back. He then sees Buffy and Willow coming down the steps, and the
door is promptly slammed in front of him. Back in Jenny's classroom, Giles
walks in. She tells him that she may have some good news, so Giles invites her
to stop by his house later. Meanwhile, Drusilla visits the shopkeeper after
hours and asks him what he's been up to with Jenny Calendar.<P>

Jenny finally completes her program. She saves the translated text on a floppy
disk which she removes from the disk drive. As she prints out the text, she
notices that Angel is sitting in the classroom. He destroys the Orb of
Thesulah, her computer, and the print-out. Angel then chases Jenny through the
school halls before finally catching her in front of the second floor window.
In a single instant, Angel snaps Jenny's neck, then drops her to the floor.<P>

Meanwhile, Giles stops by Buffy's house to pick up Jenny's book so he can
perform the revoking spell at his house. Upstairs, Joyce talks with Buffy
about her irresponsibility. When Giles gets home, he hears opera music playing
and finds a rose on his door. He enters and finds chilled wine, glasses, and a
note that simply reads &quot;Upstairs&quot;. He follows a path of roses up the
staircase, but what he finds is everything but romantic. Jenny's dead body
lies in his bed, and Giles drops the glasses and wine to the floor. Giles
stares blankly ahead as the coroners take Jenny's body out of the house. The
cops then ask Giles to come with them to the police station to answer a few
questions. Giles asks if he could first use the phone. As the phone rings at
Buffy's house, Angel watches from outside, through the windows. He watches
Buffy's face as she gives the phone, then slowly collapses against the wall
behind her. Willow immediately bursts into tears, and Joyce runs in to console
her. After a while of recovery, Xander and Cordy arrive to give Buffy and
Willow a lift to Giles' house. At this very moment, Giles stuffs his weapons
into a duffel bag and takes off for the factory. Buffy and the others arrive
too late, but they know where he's headed. At the factory, Giles throws a
flame bomb into the middle of the floor, setting it ablaze.<P>

Before Angel can run, an arrow pins him against a post behind him. As he pulls
it out, Giles ignites a club in the flames and proceeds to beat Angel
repetitively with it. Finally, Angel grabs Giles by the neck and picks him up,
but Buffy arrives just in time to take over the fight. Their battle carries on
to the catwalk above, but before Buffy can finish Angel off, he reminds her of
Giles, who remains collapsed by the rapidly spreading flames. He then throws
Buffy over the rail, but she lands on her feet and rescues Giles, thus
allowing to Angel to escape once again. Outside, Giles is furious at Buffy for
interfering in his fight, but she punches him and tells him to never leave her
alone.<P>

Another day, another morning, Giles and Buffy stand over Jenny's grave. Buffy
has finally realized that she is ready to finish Angel. In the computer
classroom, Willow takes over as substitute teacher until the new teacher can
arrive. As she arranges Jenny's desk, she unknowingly drops a disk through a
crack between the desk and a file cabinet. There the disk lies, the key to
Angel's restoration.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

With its gloriously morose voice-over narration, 'Passion' is a terribly
sombre episode, darker in tone than any other in Season Two. Much of the
episode is typical of the series, but it plummets into previously unexplored
depths. For the first twenty-seven minutes it's all doom and gloom, and then
it gets even worse.<P>

It's a cruel episode, one that takes its cue from Angel's &quot;gag gifts&quot;. It
plays with the audience's expectations, setting them up for one thing, and
then delivering another. Its pivotal event - Angel killing Jenny - is
genuinely distressing, and completely shocking. It marks a turning point in
the series, and for several of its characters, ending the entente cordiale
between Angel and Giles. It's a scene that's perfectly shot and beautifully
mounted by director Michael Gershman, giving the series one of it's most
memorable sequences.<P>

Ty King's grim tale doesn't quite achieve the balance between horror and
humour, and some of the more comedic touches fall flat, like tasteless jokes
at a funeral. Nevertheless, it's a compelling story, and one that will
confound anyone who thinks that the series was going soft. There are numerous
almost incidental elements that make 'Passion' so enjoyable: the character of
the Juju man (&quot;I just love those New Agers, they helped to send my youngest to
college!&quot;); the increasing sexual tension between Spike, Angel and Drusilla;
Willow's temporary conversion to Catholicism; and &quot;the talk&quot; between Joyce and
Buffy.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

Pop culture: Xander's line &quot;If Giles wants to go after the fiend who murdered
his girlfriend, I say 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'&quot; is a reference to Russ
Meyer's 1966 kitsch classic 'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill'. The film also
inspired the name of a punk rock band.<P>

Director Michael Gershman more usually serves as the series' Director of
Photography.<P>

Jenny's computer disk falls between two desks at the end of the episode, but
don't think that will be the last you see of it.<P>
