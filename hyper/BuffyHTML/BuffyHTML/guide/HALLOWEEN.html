&quot;Buffy, you may be hot stuff when it comes to demonology or whatever, but when it comes to dating, I'm the slayer!&quot; - Cordelia
<P>

It's time for Buffy and Angel's first actual date and she's late -- she's been
off slaying, while, unbeknownst to her, an undead bystander has videotaped her
actions for Spike to study. But other matters need attending to -- Buffy,
Willow and Xander have been shanghaied into being trick-or-treat chaperones
for Halloween. Buffy's disappointed, as this is the one night she has heard on
which the undead like to chill, and she was looking forward to doing nothing.
Buffy and Willow realize they know very little about Angel's personal life,
and decide to steal Giles' watcher journals. They stumble upon a picture of a
beautiful noblewoman from 1775 -- when Angel was 18 -- and Buffy feels
extremely inadequate. While costume shopping, Buffy finds a dress just like
the one the noblewoman wore. Xander decides to wear army fatigues, and Willow
goes for a cheesy ghost costume. Meanwhile, Spike is off watching the video of
Buffy and his girlfriend Drusilla predicts Buffy will become weak on Halloween
from some new outside force -- the costume salesman, who we see chanting to a
statue by candlelight.<P>

On Halloween, Willow dresses like a hoochie mama. Buffy is delighted, but
Willow chickens out and is a ghost once again. While Buffy the noblewoman,
Willow the ghost, and Xander the soldier are out with their little
trick-or-treaters, things start changing, thanks to our chanting costumer, and
the three become the characters they were pretending to be. Now that Buffy is
no longer the slayer, Spike goes to kill Buffy. Giles figures out that the
costume shop is somehow involved, and discovers the chanter -- who is actually
an old friend, Ethan. Ethan threatens to reveal secrets about Giles to
Sunnydale, but Giles decks him and demands to know how to break the spell. As
Giles shatters the statue, as instructed by Ethan, Spike is just about to kill
Buffy. In the nick of time, she returns to being Buffy the Vampire Slayer and
pummels Spike, who runs off. Once they're finally alone, Buffy tells Angel she
dressed like that to please him, but he admits he hated those noblewomen -- he
wanted someone exciting and interesting. They make out at last -- who said the
undead don't like to have fun on Halloween? The next day, Giles returns to
Ethan's store, which is bare except for a note which says, &quot;Be seeing you.&quot;<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

It's odd that the American tradition of Trick or Treating, which seems so much
fun, hasn't been more heartily embraced this side of the Atlantic. 'Halloween'
provides a backdrop rich in potential. Carl Ellsworth's clever script takes
full advantage of the situation, and even makes time to expand our knowledge
about Angel and, especially, Giles. There are one or two underdeveloped
elements: Spike and Drusilla's appearance is rather perfunctory, for example,
and shifts the focus away from the episode's villain du jour, Ethan.<P>

It's obvious that everyone had a lot of fun making this episode. The script
gives all the main actors a chance to expand their range a little, even if
they have to do it dressed in silly costumes. Although Alyson Hannigan puts up
some stiff competition, Sarah Michelle Gellar steals the show as the prim and
proper 1775 noblewoman: &quot;I was brought up a proper lady. I wasn't meant to
understand things. I'm just meant to look pretty, and then someone nice will
marry me, possibly a Baron!&quot;<P>

There's a wonderful dark side to 'Halloween' which seems to underpin all the
best episodes. Scenes of the children morphing into monsters and demons are
great fun, but it's the scenes between Ethan Rayne and &quot;Ripper&quot; that are the
most intriguing. They open up new avenues of potential which are sadly only
touched upon in subsequent episodes.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

According to the book in Giles' library, Angel was eighteen in 1775, and still
human. British actor Robin Sachs appeared as Heinrich in the 1971 Hammer movie
&quot;Vampire Circus&quot;. He's also featured in &quot;Jurassic Park - The Lost World&quot; and a
couple of episodes of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.<P>
