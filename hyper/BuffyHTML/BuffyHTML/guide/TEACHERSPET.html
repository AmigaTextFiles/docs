<P>
Buffy's kindly biology teacher, Dr. Gregory, is attacked after class by a
giant praying mantis, but as far as the students know, their teacher is just
missing. The mysterious Angel appears at the Bronze that night to warn Buffy
about a pending attack. His arm looks as if it was cut by a tiger's claw. The
next day, Dr. Gregory's class is being taught by a substitute teacher -- the
pretty Miss Natalie French, who drives Xander ga-ga. She tells the class about
the science fair, and asks for volunteers to help her create a model of a
praying mantis egg sacks -- after school. As expected, Xander's hand shoots
up, as does football heart-throb Blayne's and every other boy in the class.
Miss French decides that Blayne can be her assistant that afternoon, and
Xander the next. Later in the cafeteria, Cordelia opens the fridge to discover
Dr. Gregory's headless body. Buffy speculates that Angel's warning and his
unusual wound have something to do with Dr. Gregory's gruesome murder, so she
stakes out the park. She sees a vampire with one arm that has three sharp
claws where the hand should be. The creature approaches Miss French, who is
walking by with grocery bags, but instead of pouncing on her, he sniffs her
and runs away in terror.<P>

Buffy catches the teacher turning her head around -- all the way around. Buffy
finally figures it out: Miss French is a praying mantis! Following her lead,
Giles tries to get in touch with a friend in England who's an expert in the
field -- the only catch being that the man is institutionalized. Meanwhile,
hacker par excellence Willow has found that Blayne's mother has reported him
missing. Since it's Xander's turn to work with Miss French this afternoon,
Buffy warns him, but he thinks Buffy is just jealous. Miss French gives Xander
a drink as soon as he shows up. As he's getting dizzy, he thinks he hears
someone calling, but she ignores it. She takes his hand, and her arm turns
into a praying mantis' foreleg. He promptly passes out, and he is dragged away
by Miss French. When he comes to, he finds himself in a cage in Miss French's
cellar, with Blayne in an adjoining cage. Surrounded by headless bodies in
cages, he calls to Miss French, who has now completely converted into her
giant-mantis form.<P>

After talking to his strait-jacketed friend, Giles confirms there is a
creature called a She-Mantis, who lures male virgins to her nest. An extremely
powerful foe, it was the She-Mantis who put Giles' friend into his deranged
condition. Buffy suggests that Giles record some bat sonar from the video
library -- playing that for the She-Mantis will disrupt her nervous system.
Exhausting other methods, Buffy decides to enlist Claw Guy to help her sniff
out the She-Mantis. Going from door to door, he finally winces when they reach
the correct house. Turning on her, he tries to attack Buffy, who promptly
kills him with a fence slat. Buffy enters the basement and uses a few blasts
of the insecticide to send her scurrying off, then plays the bat sonar. The
tape has the desired effect on the crazed insect, enabling Buffy to hack it to
death with a machete. We think this is the end of the She-Mantis until we
catch a glimpse of the inside of Dr. Gregory's classroom closet, where a
glistening egg sack is stirring at the bottom.<P>

With a kooky plot, Teacher's Pet struggles to tread new ground, as if the
producers were having trouble coming to terms with a story that wasn't simply
about Buffy and the vampires. It's also uncomfortably paced, with several
elements that seem to have been tagged on to a short script, to bring it up to
the regulation length. The plot strands involving the fork-handed vampire, the
diversion to visit the real Miss French, and Xander's guitar-playing daydream
(They don't think it's kind of a clue that Xander is falling in love with Buffy? - Ed) all seem superfluous. David Greenwalt's script brings some new dimensions to
Xander's character, but emphasises the more buffoonish aspects. To compensate
there are a few delightful moments, including Cordelia explaining that some
good has come of Doctor Gregory's death, (the discovery of his headless body
in the canteen refrigerator has put her off her food and she's lost seven
ounces!), and the mental image conjured by Giles' description of his
strait-jacketed colleague, Carlisle.<P>

The effects for the She-Mantis are very effective, helped no doubt by the
dingy lighting in Miss French's basement. It would have been more satisfying
though if there had been more interaction between the She-Mantis and Buffy
during the episode's finale.<P>
