A young woman is chased to a cemetery by a bunch of men wearing monk's robes.
But Buffy and her merry band are unaware of this, and are delighted about the
recent lull of activity on the Hellmouth. Giles frets about this, telling
Buffy she shouldn't get lax about her training, but Buffy is ready to let her
hair down a little. Meanwhile, Cordelia is dating a fraternity man, Richard --
intrigued mostly by his wealth and society connections. When smarmy Richard
comes to pick her up at school, his sweet frat brother, Tom, charms Buffy. But
Buffy doesn't want to go to their frat party. As far as she's concerned, she's
&quot;seeing&quot; Angel -- if only in the dark. When Buffy tries to get Angel to go out
with her, he says their difference in age is a problem, as well as the fact
that his demon side tends to take over when he becomes passionate. Dejected,
she decides to join Cordelia at the frat party, which requires lying to
ever-vigilant Giles about her evening's activities. Buffy and Cordelia are
both drugged at the party and chained in the basement with the young woman
from the cemetery. Back at school, a broken, bloody bracelet Buffy found at
the cemetery is traced by Willow and Giles to the woman who had been chased.<P>

Willow's hacking skills lead to more info -- a year earlier to the day, three
other women disappeared and were never found. They go to the frat party with
Angel and Xander just as the three women are about to be offered up as a
sacrifice to Machida, a snake-like demon who arises every year and is
worshipped by the frat boys. Buffy manages to break loose and a scuffle
ensues. Tom, who turns out to be way wicked, is about to cut Buffy's throat,
but she grabs the sword and defeats Machida. Cordelia, messy but undaunted,
chides Tom as he is led away with a typically pithy remark: &quot;You're going to
jail for fifteen thousand years!&quot; Giles forgives Buffy for her lie, and Angel
shows up at the Bronze and asks Buffy out for coffee. She grins and takes a
rain check, as any self-respecting slayer would, and all is well again at the
unpredictable Hellmouth.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

Let's face it: there's always something nasty in the cellar. If it isn't Beryl
Reid and Flora Robson's deformed brother ('The Beast In The Cellar', 1971) or
a clergyman's cannibal son ('The Ghoul', 1974), it must be a fraternity's
reptile god! Writer David Greenwalt's script adds some new twists to a
well-worn theme, but it proved to be a bit too ambitious for Greenwalt the
director. He made some changes to the end of the story, reducing Machida's
interaction with the frat boys and keeping the creature lurking in the
shadows. Because of this it's not made apparent until the last moments of the
episode that Machida has been supporting the college for decades - an
interesting idea which isn't given any time to develop.<P>

British viewers are likely to feel a little alienated by the fraternity system
so beloved by American colleges and American filmmakers. It's all rather
baffling, and perhaps prevents a fair evaluation. However, it's evident that
'Reptile Boy' is a scrappy and uneven episode which never quite strikes the
right balance between the light and dark elements of the plot. Fans might
derive some pleasure from seeing Xander dressed as a woman, or Buffy dancing,
but the episode never maintains a consistent tone.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

The actor playing Machida, Robin Atkin Downes, is perhaps better known for his
regular role as the telepath Byron on 'Babylon 5'.<P>

The leader of the fraternity, Richard, is played by Greg Vaughan, who also
played Charisma Carpenter's boyfriend in the short-lived Aaron Spelling drama
series 'Malibu Shores'.<P>
