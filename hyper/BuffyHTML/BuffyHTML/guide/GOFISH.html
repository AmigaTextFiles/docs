<P>
The beach is the site for the victory party of the Sunnydale High swim team,
and everyone's celebrating except Buffy. One of the team members, Cameron,
approaches the lonely Slayer and keeps her company. Another team member, Dodd,
mocks Jonathan in front of everybody, so Buffy steps in to stop the
foolishness. Dodd and fellow member Gage then leave the party and walk along
the shore. Suddenly, Dodd disappears without Gage even noticing. He smells a
strong odor coming from somewhere, so he decides to return to the party. He
doesn't hear Dodd quietly scream in agony, nor does he notice the scaly
creature walking away from Dodd's remains.<P>

The next morning, Principal Snyder stops by the computer classroom to talk to
Willow about one of her students, Gage. He is currently getting an &quot;F&quot; in the
class, and Snyder encourages her to work his grade into a passing one.
Meanwhile, Cameron gives a Buffy a ride to school, then tries to put the moves
on her. She retaliates by busting his nose on the steering wheel. Principal
Snyder sees this and calls the two of them to Nurse Greenliegh's office. The
swim team coach, Marin, meets them there, and they discuss their chances for
winning the state title. In the library, Buffy learns that Dodd's insides were
eaten from some mysterious creature, leaving only his skin behind. Hours
later, Xander takes a study break and heads to the vending machine. He bumps
into Cameron, who is on his way to the cafeteria. Cam notices a foul smell
when he enters the cafeteria, and a horrific scream follows soon after. Xander
follows the sound, but he's too late, for all that remains of Cameron is his
skin on the cafeteria floor. Xander then turns around and encounters the scaly
creature that most likely killed Cameron.<P>

Later, Xander explains to Giles and Cordy that the creature got away before he
could get a good look at it. Without Cameron gone, Giles determines the
pattern of the killing is connected to the swim team ranks. Dodd and Cameron
were the first and second best swimmers on the team, respectively. Since Gage
is the third best, he would most likely be the creature's next target. Buffy
decides to keep an eye on Gage, while Willow interrogates Jonathan, who has
tried out for the team several times but never made it on. All Willow learns
is that Jonathan peed in the pool. Later that night, Gage confronts Buffy
about her spying on him. She tries to come up with a good excuse, then simply
tells Gage what's really going on. He doesn't buy it, so he turns and walks
out. Outside, he meets Angel, who promptly sinks his teeth into Gage's neck,
hoping to turn him into a demon. Buffy arrives on the scene just in time to
witness Angel suddenly withdrawing his fangs from Gage's neck and spitting the
blood out. He tosses Gage's weakened body at Buffy and makes his escape, all
the while spitting out the blood in disgust. Gage believes Buffy now, so he
asks her to walk him home.<P>

At swim practice the next day, Buffy tells Willow and Cordy about Angel's
distaste for Gage's blood. She believes that Gage may have been taking
steroids, which might have turned Angel off. Willow then considers the
possibility that the steroids might be what's attracting the creature. They
then find out that Xander has joined the swim team. The position was open due
to the recent deaths, so Xander took it as an opportunity to spy on Gage when
Buffy couldn't. After spending some time in the steam room, Xander gets
dressed and meets Buffy outside of the locker room, telling her that Gage is
still inside.<P>

She soon hears Gage screaming and runs inside, where she sees the creature
standing in front of Gage. She gets between the two of them, but something's
wrong with Gage. To her horror, Buffy watches as Gage tears away his own skin
in agony before emerging as the same type of creature standing behind her.
Gage's former skin drops to the floor, and he quickly attacks Buffy. The two
of them are too much for Buffy, and when her guard drops, one of them bite
into her arm. Coach Marin arrives to pull Buffy out of danger, and the two
creatures escape through a hole in the floor. Buffy and Giles question Coach
Marin, but he denies any knowledge of substance abuse in his team. They can't
figure out what's going on, so Buffy assigns Xander to learn more about the
team's drug use while she and Willow talk to Nurse Greenliegh. However, Nurse
Greenliegh is already being led to her doom by Coach Marin, who won't listen
to her pleas to stop the experiments. He drops her into the sewer below, where
the fish creatures quickly feed on her.<P>

In the steam room, Xander learns from one of the other members that the
steroids are in the steam itself. This means that Xander has been exposed to
the same substance that transformed Dodd, Cameron, and Gage. He tells the
others that he's already been in the steam room three times, so Buffy talks to
Coach Marin. Eventually, he tells her about Russian experiments with fish DNA
on their Olympic swimmers. He then draws a gun and orders Buffy to drop into
the sewer so his boys could satisfy their &quot;other needs&quot;. After dropping down,
Buffy sees the chewed-up remains of Nurse Greenliegh floating in the murky
water. Upstairs by the pool, Cordy mistakes a newly-emerged fish creature for
Xander. She expresses her sorrow for his fate, but Xander shows up again, just
in time to save her from the creature's attack. They return to the library,
where Giles has locked up the remaining members of the swim team. Xander then
goes to see Coach Marin, and they engage in a struggle over the gun. Down
below, Buffy fends off the creatures until they finally surround her from all
angles. Xander knocks Coach Marin down and extends his arm through the hole
for Buffy. She leaps up, grabs Xander's hand, and is pulled to safety.<P>

Coach Marin gets up for one last strike, but Buffy is ready this time. She
sweeps him off his feet, sending Marin into the sewer with his swimmers. They
converge on him, leaving Coach Marin with nothing to do but scream. Later,
Xander tells the others that he has to get a blood transfusion along with the
rest of the team, hoping that will prevent them from changing. As they speak,
the fish creatures swim out into the ocean, against the current.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

There is an interesting theme at the core of this episode: that schools,
particularly American schools, treat their more athletically adept pupils
differently in order to bolster the school's reputation. There's probably less
competition between UK schools, and certainly less pressure on them to better
their rivals, but the point is well made.<P>

We see several examples of how the swimming team works to a different set of
standards: members playing solitaire - solitaire??! - in Willow's computer
lesson, bullying fellow students, and even Cameron attempting to rape Buffy,
all of which are virtually ignored to make sure the school's success at sports
isn't jeopardised.<P>

We also get to see exactly how far the team members themselves will go in
order to win.<P>

It's not surprising that Cordelia has some sympathies with this Nietzsche-like
system: &quot;Certain people are entitled to special privileges. They're called
winners, That's the way the world works&quot;.<P>

All of this would be a little too prosaic to sit comfortably with the series'
format, if it wasn't for the fantastical elements, which add interest, and
give the episode a modicum of much-needed levity. There are few laughs:
Cordelia's rambling speech to Sean, who she mistakes for Xander, is a rare
moment of deft humour. It doesn't really sparkle, but Charisma Carpenter
delivers it beautifully.<P>

The sea creatures are atypically unimpressive when you see them in close-ups,
but they do look pretty svelte underwater. Traditionally similar stories
involve situations where humans are invading the domain of the sea creature,
and where they are literally out of their element. This episode rarely mines
the potential of such situations, and is nowhere near as suspenseful as, for
example, the scene in 'Aliens' where a child is standing in a pool from which
an alien could appear any moment.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

We knew that Sunnydale had docks (it's where Buffy Angel went to dispose of
the Judge's hand, in <A href=SURPRISE.html>Surprise</A>), but here we discover that Sunnydale is a
coastal town. So, how come it took thirty-two episodes before there was a
scene on the beach!? Pop culture: Xander's line &quot;This was no boating accident&quot;
echoes a famous line from 'Jaws', Steven Spielberg's 1977 movie about a killer
shark. Xander also makes a reference to the dire 1983-1987 TV series 'The
A-Team'.<P>

Willow has a line: &quot;Like an Oreo cookie, except for, you know, without the
chocolaty cookie goodness&quot;. Oreos are American cream-filled biscuits, which
you can also find in some British supermarkets! What you might not know is
that Alyson Hannigan (Willow) once appeared in an advert for Oreos.<P>

If you liked this episode, you might want to check out Jack Arnold's great
1954 movie 'The Creature From The Black Lagoon', a film which certainly
influenced the design of 'Go Fish''s monsters.<P>
