&quot;Slayer, you think you've won. When he rises, you'll wish I'd killed you all...&quot; - Balthazar
<P>
During a typical night of patrolling and slaying vampires, Buffy and Faith encounter a not-so-typical vampire wielding a pair of swords. They successfully reduce the vamp to dust, but Buffy and Faith soon realize that the two swords are nowhere to be seen. The swords have, in fact, been brought to Mayor Wilkins' office by Mr. Trick. After looking them over, Mayor reminds Mr. Trick and his deputy mayor, Allan Finch, of the upcoming dedication and the hundred days which will ultimately lead to the ascension, and that nothing can interfere with it. The next morning, in the school lounge, Willow proudly shows her early admittance packets from several big-name universities to her friends. Meanwhile, Giles listens as Buffy's new watcher boast pathetically that he's faced two vampires himself, &quot;under controlled circumstances, of course.&quot; Buffy arrives, and the new watcher introduces himself to her as Wesley Wyndam-Pryce. Buffy says very little except to ask Giles if the new watcher is evil.
<P>
When asked about the previous night's patrol, Buffy describes the vampire packing the two swords. Wesley scans through his books and quickly locates some information on a fifteenth-century duelist cult called El Eliminati. They once worked for Balthazar, an ancient demon, before he was apparently killed. In order to explain their current presence in Sunnydale, Wesley theorizes that they may be looking for an amulet that has been hidden in the Gleaves family crypt. Just then, Faith arrives, meets Wesley, then immediately turns and leaves (&quot;Screw that!&quot;). After Buffy catches up with her, Faith tells her that they don't have to follow their new Watcher's orders. Later that night, Buffy searches through the tombs inside the Gleaves crypt. Just as she locates the amulet, she hears several voices approaching from outside. As Buffy hides in one of the other tombs, the Eliminati vampires enter the crypt and take the amulet. After they leave, Buffy gets out of the tomb and is shocked by Faith's unexpected arrival. They go after the vampires, following them underground. In the course of the battle, one of the vampires attempts to drown Buffy in a pool of water. Thinking he has succeeded, he releases his grip, giving Buffy all the opportunity she needs to spring back to her feet (&quot;I hate it when they drown me!&quot;) and take the amulet back from the vampires.
<P>
The next day in the library, Wesley inspects the amulet while Buffy heads to her chemistry class to take a test. The chem teacher, Mrs. Taggert, leaves her students alone in the classroom, expecting them to follow the honor system. Faith appears outside one of the windows and draws a heart with a stake piercing it, signaling Buffy's early departure. Willow and Xander try to keep their friend from leaving, but Buffy is gone in no time. Faith leads Buffy to a vampire nest, where they give the sleeping demons a rather rude wake-up call. Spirits high, Buffy and Faith head to the Bronze afterwards and tear up the dance floor. Angel arrives and pulls Buffy aside to warn her that Balthazar is still alive.
<P>
When Wesley appears on the scene, Buffy takes the amulet from him and gives it to Angel for safe keeping. Later, at an abandoned warehouse, the Eliminati vampires listen to their master, Balthazar, who is a horrendously bloated demon sitting in a pool of water. Upset with one of his minions, Balthazar uses telekinesis to draw the vampire's helpless body closer. Balthazar then crushes the vampire's skull with his own two hands. Balthazar gives orders to his head minion, Vincent. Outside, Buffy and Faith spy on the gathering. In need of weaponry, Faith spots a hunting equipment shop that's closed for the night. Buffy follows as Faith breaks into the shop and proceeds to destroy some display cases containing weapons. Taking Faith's lead, Buffy obtains a dagger for herself. However, their shoplifting spree is cut short by a pair of cops with guns drawn. During the drive back to the police station, Faith talks Buffy into helping her kick the cage into the driver and his partner, causing the car to crash and enable their escape.
<P>
The next morning, Buffy checks the newspaper to see if her run-in with the law is mentioned anywhere. Apparently it isn't. Meanwhile, Mayor Wilkins is attacked by Vincent in his own office. After Mr. Trick knocks the vampire out cold, Mayor Wilkins wonders how the vampire slipped past security. Instead of having the vampire killed, Mayor Wilkins orders Mr. Trick to lock him up. Later, Willow is disappointed to learn that Buffy's schedule doesn't include her. Faith arrives shortly to pick up Buffy, leaving Willow alone. At Giles' office, Wesley criticizes the former Watcher for his job performance with Buffy. Their argument doesn't go very far before Giles notices the sudden presence of several vampires outside the office. Elsewhere, Buffy and Faith head to the warehouse to take out Balthazar and his minions. On the way, they encounter several vampires and dust them, one by one. When a hand reaches out and grabs Buffy, Faith throws the guy against a dumpster and drives her stake towards his heart. Buffy realizes that this is no vampire, but it's too late as Faith's stake plunges into the heart of Deputy Mayor Allan Finch. Within seconds, Finch is dead.
<P>
Deciding to flee from the scene, Faith and Buffy split up. Buffy runs into Angel, who notices the blood on her hands. They head towards the warehouse, where Giles and Wesley have been brought before the demon Balthazar. Wesley attempts to save his own neck by offering the man who has the amulet to Balthazar. Before any more information can be spilled, Angel and Buffy arrive and battle the vampires. Frustrated, Balthazar uses his telekinesis to bring Angel into his own hands. Thinking quick, Buffy spots a lamp hovering above the pool. She sends it falling into the water, electrocuting the obese demon. With his last breath, Balthazar warns Buffy that a greater enemy's ascension is at hand. While Buffy and the others puzzle over the meaning of Balthazar's dying words, Mayor Wilkins, kneeling in the centre of a pentagram, performs the dedication ritual in his office. After completing it, he orders Mr. Trick to release Vincent from his cage. Once freed, Vincent takes the sword and cleaves the mayor's head into two halves. Vincent then watches in shock as Mayor Wilkins' head reforms itself. Vincent steps back, and Mr. Trick takes his cue, driving a stake into his heart. Mayor Wilkins is now invincible, and he will remain so for the hundred days leading to his ascension.
<P>
Buffy visits Faith's motel room the next morning to discuss their crime. Disturbed by Faith's apparent lack of guilt, Buffy tries to convince her that the victim's body will be found eventually. Faith tells Buffy that she returned to the scene of the crime and dumped the body.

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana
<P>
<B>More Information</B>
<P>
If you've ever stopped to ponder the ethics of what Buffy does - slaying sentient beings, and even the occasional detour into genocide - then &quot;Bad Girls&quot; should give you plenty of food for thought. Throughout this episode Buffy fails to recognise the warning signs being broadcast by Faith, (discussions about how killing gives her a thrill - &quot;tell me you don't get off on this&quot; - and her reckless attack on Balthazar's El Eliminati acolytes), eventually resulting in the death of Alan, the deputy mayor.
<P>
His death, a tragic accident that Faith initially seems very disturbed about, is the catalyst that finally allows her to shed her last vestiges of responsibility. What's more tantalising is that Buffy very nearly follows her, a point well made by author Douglas Petrie in what's essentially the first part of a two-episode story. Had Alan not died, how long would it have been before Buffy was just like Faith?
<P>
Alan's death is a very powerful scene, and one that signals a fundamental change to a more mature series. With such an important A-story, it's surprising that the Balthazar plot is not underdeveloped, partly because it allows space for the introduction of Wesley, the naïve new Watcher. Alexis Denisof's scenes with Anthony Stewart Head provide wonderful counterpoint to the more grisly aspects of the drama.
<P>
<B>Trivia</B>
<P>
The piece of music playing in the Bronze, as Faith and Buffy party after their attack on El Eliminati base is 'Chinese Burn', by British group Curve, a 1997 single from their album 'Come Clean'. If it seems naggingly familiar, it's probably because Sony used it for a long-running advert for the Minidisc format.
<P>
Pop culture #1: There are several references to American newspaper comic strips that British viewers might find puzzling: 'Family Circus' is a cosy strip that's been running for forty years, and is carried by 1,500 newspapers worldwide; 'Marmaduke' is the name of a dog in a strip that's been around since 1954; 'Cathy' refers to a relative newcomer, a strip about a single mother that debuted in 1976.
<P>
Pop Culture #2: 'Let Captain Courageous here go, and I'll tell you what you need to know' contains an appropriate reference coming from the scholarly Giles: 'Captains Courageous' is the title of an 1897 novel written by Indian writer Rudyard Kipling. The book, about a wealthy young boy who falls off an ocean liner, only to be rescued by Portuguese fishermen, has been filmed several times, most notably in 1937. Not to be missed is the appearance of the young Mickey Rooney with a squeeze box.
<P>
Do Wesley's &quot;three key words for any Slayer: preparation, preparation, preparation&quot; remind you of a certain Prime Minister's 'education, education, education'? (A bit before my time - Ed)
