Willow meets up with Oz in front of one of the school's trophy cases. He has
been checking out the moving eyes in one of the cheerleading statues, the same
one in which Amy's mother, the witch, is trapped. They discuss their date the
previous night, before Willow spots Buffy and walks outside with her. Willow
is worried because Oz hasn't tried to kiss her yet, although she is happy that
he is being so nice and respectful. Later that night, Xander and Cordelia make
out in her car, which is parked in the woods. Xander hears a noise but
Cordelia, having not heard the noise, continues to make fun of him and his
relationships with Buffy and Willow. Then suddenly the hairy arm of a werewolf
breaks through the roof of the car. Cordy throws the car in reverse then
brakes, sending the werewolf tumbling off of the car. They then drive out as
fast as they can. The next morning, Xander tells Giles that they encountered a
werewolf. Giles is quite excited, for he has never personally dealt with a
werewolf case before.<P>

In gym, the class is studying self-defence. Xander's latent jealousy of Oz's
relationship with Willow is becoming more and more obvious. Buffy tries to
pretend she's a normal girl, but when Larry grabs her behind during a throw
session, Buffy flips him over her shoulder and onto the mat. Back at the
library, Giles has learned that a werewolf goes on the prowl on the night of
the full moon and the two nights surrounding it, making that a total of three
nights in every month.<P>

Later that night, one of Buffy's classmates, Theresa, is walking home alone
when she bumps in Angel, who offers to walk her home. Meanwhile, Buffy and
Giles investigate Lover's Lane in the woods, hoping to find the werewolf and
bring it back alive, for it is still a human twenty-eight days out of the
month. Buffy gets trapped in a net that lifts her to the top of the trees. As
she calls for help from Giles, a poacher named Cain appears with a shotgun.
After realizing that his catch is not a werewolf, he cuts the net down, and
Giles helps Buffy out. Cain explains that he hunts werewolves to make money.
He then asks them if they know where else the teenagers might hang out, since
werewolves are attracted to sexual heat. Buffy feigns ignorance, so Cain
leaves and goes off on his own.<P>

Buffy and Giles then drive towards the Bronze, which fits Cain's description
perfectly. As they arrive there, dozens of frightened teens evacuate the
Bronze, for the werewolf has already arrived. Buffy runs inside by herself and
pulls a chain out of her backpack. She tries to tie up the werewolf, but it
breaks free of the chain and escapes. While Buffy and Giles deal with Cain,
who is upset that she tried to capture it instead of kill it, the werewolf
wanders down the alleys when it discovers Theresa's body. There are two bite
marks on its neck, and all the blood has been drained from its body. The
werewolf looks up and sees Angel. The two growl at each other, but do not
attack. Angel eventually backs off and disappears.<P>

Early next morning before sunrise, Buffy and Giles hear on the radio that
Theresa was found dead, and her murder may be linked to the werewolf. They now
have only night left before the werewolf goes into remission for the remainder
of the month. As the sun rises, the werewolf slowly transforms back to human
form while it is sleeping. Once all the hair fades away to reveal flesh, we
see that the werewolf is Oz. After waking up and realizing that he is naked in
the woods, Oz suspects that he may be the werewolf. He goes home and calls his
aunt. Oz asks her about his cousin Jordy, who bit him recently. Apparently,
his aunt knows that Jordy is a werewolf, and since he bit Oz, the curse has
been passed along. Oz goes to school that day in a daze, and he is horrified
to learn that he may have killed Theresa the previous night. Xander suspects
that Larry may be the werewolf, so he leaves to question him in the locker
room. Willow invites Oz to help her do some research later that night, but Oz
refuses and runs off, leaving Willow upset over his apparent change of heart.
In the locker room, Xander confronts Larry in the locker room. Xander tells
him that he knows the secret that Larry has been hiding, only to find out that
Larry's secret is his homosexuality. Misunderstanding Xander's words, Larry
now believes that Xander is also gay, but assures him that their secret is
safe between them. Feeling relieved and better about himself, Larry thanks
Xander and walks off.<P>

Realizing that the police reports never mentioned anything about Theresa being
mauled, Buffy and Xander visit the funeral home and inspect Theresa's body.
Sure enough, they find two bite marks on her neck, signifying death by
vampire. While Buffy signs the guestbook, Theresa suddenly gets up behind her,
only now her face is that of a vampire. In the middle of their fight, Theresa
throws Buffy off guard by saying that Angel sent her. Luckily, Xander is able
to stake her through the back before she can take advantage of Buffy's
disoriented state. After being helped up, Buffy embraces Xander for a short
while, expressing her fear of Angel's relentlessness. She then realizes her
position, gathers herself together, and leaves, with Xander following behind.
Elsewhere, Oz knows that he must not be able to leave the house that night, so
brings out a box of chains and shackles.<P>

Before Oz can lock himself up, Willow knocks on the door. She is obviously
upset by his decision to stay home and do nothing by himself instead of
spending the time with her. Oz tries to warn her of the danger, but it is too
late, for his transformation has already begun. Willow screams and runs out of
the house, while the werewolf chases her down the block and into the woods.
Before he can attack Willow, a different scent catches the werewolf's nose, so
he leaves Willow alone. She runs off to the library, where Giles is loading up
a tranquilizer gun. Willow tells Giles and Buffy that Oz is the werewolf, so
they rush out to the woods. Buffy kicks the shotgun out of Cain's hand just
before he pulls the trigger. After knocking Cain down, Buffy fights the
werewolf, which prevents Giles from getting a clean shot. Buffy is then
knocked into Giles and Willow. As the werewolf charges them, Willow grabs the
tranquilizer gun and shoots him, causing him to stumble back and collapse. As
Cain gets up, Buffy bends his gun with her bare hands, then orders him to
leave.<P>

The next day, Oz tells Willow that he'll be fine, as long as he locks himself
up around the full moon every month. To his surprise, Willow is still
interested in continuing their relationship. As she leaves, Willow kisses Oz
for the first time.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

The first half of this episode is a relatively straightforward whodunnit
reminiscent of the kitsch 1974 movie 'The Beast Must Die', (based on a story
by James Blish called 'There Shall Be No Darkness'), and it's only once the
identity of the werewolf has been revealed that the story begins to sparkle.
If anything the story is rather too incident-packed. There are several plot
threads all competing for space, and sadly a few of them don't get enough to
screen time to work satisfactorily. Cain, the macho werewolf hunter, suffers
most from attention deficit disorder, and is rather underwritten.
(Incidentally, he's given a first name - Gib - in the episode's official
synopsis, probably indicating that there may have been some scripted scenes
featuring him that were dropped from the final version).<P>

Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali's fourth script for the series has real depth,
and gently plays with gender roles without becoming dull, or undermining the
main thrust of the drama. Bruce Seth Green is a director with a lot of
experience with genre shows, and he handles the difficult action and the
human-to-werewolf transformation scenes very ably. The special effects team
deserve credit, too, for creating a werewolf costume that wouldn't disgrace a
well-budgeted feature film. If you enjoyed this episode, check out Joe Dante's
excellent 1981 movie 'The Howling'!<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

The episode opens with Oz admiring the cheerleading trophy that was featured
in <A href=THEWITCH.html>The Witch</A>. There are lots of other continuity references in the episode,
including allusions to <A href=THEPACK.html>The Pack</A>, <A href=IROBOTYOU.html>I Robot You Jane</A> and <A href=TEACHERSPET.html>Teacher's Pet</A><P>

Bruce Seth Green's credits include episodes of 'American Gothic', 'Babylon 5'
and 'V'. More appropriately, he has also directed as episodes of 'Airwolf' and
'The She Wolf of London'! He's not related to Seth Green (Oz), in case you
were wondering.<P>
