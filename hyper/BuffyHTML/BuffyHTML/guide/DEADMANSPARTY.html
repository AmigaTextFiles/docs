<P><B>Dead Man's Party</B>
<BR>3ABB02<P>
<HR>
<P>
After unpacking the last of her belongings, Buffy stops by her mom's bedroom
to announce that she's heading outside. Joyce hangs up a Nigerian mask that
she got from a friend at her art gallery, then hesitantly gives her daughter
permission to go find her friends. Later, in a dark alley, Buffy notices a
shadowy figure roaming the alleys.<P>

Suspicious, she follows him and accidentally draws his attention by stepping
on an aluminum can. The figure spins around and thrusts a stake at her, which
Buffy easily blocks. As she grabs the stake out of the man's hands and turns
it towards him, she realizes that it's Xander. Before either of them can say
much, a vampire appears and attacks the both of them. During the struggle,
Buffy hears Cordelia's voice on a walkie- talkie attached to Xander's waist.
Soon enough, Cordy, Willow, and Oz arrive on the scene, all decked out with
stakes and crosses. Buffy is surprised to see her friends work as a team to
get the vampire off of Buffy. One by one, though, they are knocked to the
ground by the powerful vampire. Finally, Buffy jumps in and finishes the job,
reducing the vampire to a pile of dust. After Buffy greets her bewildered
friends, they head over to Giles' apartment. The Watcher is emotionally
overcome with joy from seeing his Slayer safe and sound, although he doesn't
fully express it until he's alone in his kitchen. In the living room, Buffy
avoids discussion topics relating to what she did over the summer. She then
makes plans with Willow to meet somewhere the next afternoon.<P>

The next day, Joyce and Buffy visit Principal Snyder in his office. Despite
Joyce's protests, Snyder refuses to readmit Buffy back into the school.
Afterwards, Joyce drops Buffy off at a coffee shop where she plans to meet
Willow. However, Willow never shows up. Buffy heads home, and as she heads
towards her front door, a woman steps out. She introduces herself as Pat, a
friend of Joyce's at the book club. Inside, Joyce tells Buffy that she invited
Giles and her friends over to dinner the following evening. Buffy goes into
the basement to get their fancy company plates. There, she finds a stray cat
that has been dead for a while. Buffy and Joyce bury it outside. Later that
night, after both Buffy and Joyce have fallen asleep, the eyeholes of the mask
in Joyce's bedroom begin to glow. As they do so, the stray cat works its way
out of the ground as if it had never died.<P>

Overnight, Buffy dreams that she is walking around the Sunnydale High campus.
Nobody else is there, except for Angel. She then wakes up and heads to the
kitchen. The stray cat reenters the Summers home, shocking both Buffy and
Joyce. Giles arrives shortly with a cage to capture the cat and bring it back
to the library for further study. After finding the cat in Joyce's bedroom, he
notices the Nigerian mask on her wall. He then informs Buffy that she is no
longer allowed on school grounds. At the library, Giles studies his demonology
text while the rest of the Slayerettes make plans for the dinner that evening.
By the end of their discussion, the intimate dinner has become a full-blown
party, complete with pot luck snacks and Oz's band. During the discussion,
Giles careless flips past a page without looking at it. On this page is a
picture of the same mask hanging in Joyce's bedroom.<P>

That evening, Pat comes over to visit Joyce. Merely moments after Buffy shuts
the door, Oz's band, Dingoes Ate My Baby, arrives. Buffy was not notified in
advance that they had planned a huge party, but that's exactly what she gets
before long. After wading through dozens of people she's never even met
before, Buffy finds Willow near the band. Buffy pulls her over to a quieter
area and asks Willow if she's been avoiding her. Willow denies this, then
immediately leaves Buffy alone and heads back to where the band is playing. On
her way upstairs, Buffy briefly talks to Xander and Cordelia, who are lost in
their own world of nonstop smoochies. Buffy then stops outside the kitchen,
where Joyce and Pat are talking about having Buffy back home. Buffy overhears
her mom talking about how much more difficult it is now that Buffy's home.
Unable to take much more animosity from her closest friends and family, Buffy
goes up to her bedroom and starts packing her bag again. Meanwhile, Giles
finally finds what he's been looking for in his texts: the picture of the
Nigerian mask. Horrified by what he reads, he calls the Summers home, but one
of the partygoers answers the phone, and the music is too loud for him to
fully understand what Giles is saying. Giles gives up and drives towards
Buffy's home. On the way, he accidentally hits a man in the middle of the
road. Upon getting out and inspecting the body, Giles realizes that this man
died long before he ever wandered onto the road. The corpse grabs Giles and
shoves him against the car. Giles watches in horror as he sees several more
zombies appearing from the shadows. All over town, corpses arise from crime
scenes, hospital beds, and even their graves, all with one destination in
mind: the Summers household. Giles finally fends off the zombies and gets back
in his car, but is forced to hotwire it when he realises he's dropped his keys
outside.<P>

Willow finds Buffy packing her bag in her bedroom. Not long after they argue
over Buffy's decision to run away, Joyce enters the bedroom. Her reaction to
seeing Buffy's packed bag is much more heated. Buffy tries to get out of the
house, but Joyce stops her right in the middle of the main floor. As everybody
gathers around and watches, Joyce drops all her restraints and angrily chews
out Buffy for what she did (and didn't do) over the summer. Buffy tries to
defend herself, but Xander joins in and offers his own cold remarks. Just as
it seems that everybody is against Buffy and her whole world is caving in, the
zombies invade the household. They quickly and brutally attack and kill
several of the guests, while everybody else runs for their lives. Many try to
keep the doors and windows blocked off, while others just panic in general.
One of the zombies grabs Pat and drags her off down a hallway. While Buffy,
Joyce, Xander, and Willow run upstairs, Oz and Cordelia hide in a downstairs
closet. Upstairs, Joyce finds Pat lying flat on the floor. They help her to
her feet and into Joyce's bedroom. While the group tries to keep the zombies
from forcing the door open, Willow checks Pat's pulse and realizes that she's
already dead.<P>

Several moments later, Oz and Cordelia step out of the closet and notice that
all of the zombies are now upstairs. They run into Giles, who has just
arrived. He explains that the mask contains the power of the zombie demon
named Ovu Mobani, or Evil Eye. All the zombies are after it, and whoever puts
it on will become the demon. Upstairs, nobody notices Pat as she suddenly gets
up. Surprised to see that her friend is alive, Joyce runs over, only to be
knocked to the floor by the zombie Pat. As Joyce and Xander look on, Pat puts
the mask on, which immediately molds to her face. Pat begins to speak, except
it isn't her voice anymore. It is the voice of the demon Ovu Mobani, and the
zombies that were previously trying to get into the room are now paralyzed
with fear by Mobani's presence. Buffy tries to attack the demon, but it turns
its head and flashes a brilliantly white light which stuns Buffy. Unable to
move, Buffy takes the powerful blow of the demon hard. The demon then stuns
Willow and moves in for the kill, but not before Buffy recovers and pushes
Mobani through the second story window, along with herself. After they crash
onto her backyard, Buffy tries to avoid the demon's gaze by covering her eyes.
Giles tells Oz to warn Buffy that attacking its eyes is the only way to defeat
Mobani. Oz runs out and immediately falls victim to Mobani's stun flash. Buffy
uses this moment to her advantage and thrusts a shovel directly into the
demon's eyes. It cries out in horror, then vanishes, along with all of the
other zombies. After everybody regroups inside, nobody can bring themselves to
spite Buffy any longer, as she finally embraces Willow after so long.<P>

The next day, Giles visits Principal Snyder's office and threatens to contact
state officials if Buffy isn't readmitted. When Snyder doesn't believe his
threat, Giles applies a little brute force to get his message across. Later,
Buffy and Willow meet at the coffee shop. Willow discusses her experiments
with witchcraft. They understand what each other has been feeling during the
past few months, and like the true friends that they are, accept it.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

If you were to ask a casual viewer to sum up the plot of this episode no doubt
they'd focus on the Ovu Mobani mask and the zombies that gatecrash Buffy's
welcome home party. But, as is often the case with BtVS, appearances can be
deceptive and this episode has perhaps the most superficial veneer of any to
date.<P>

The first clue as to what lies at the heart of Dead Man's Party is that the
action follows straight on from the end of the previous episode, <A href=ANNE.html>Anne</A>, with
Buffy unpacking her clothes after returning home. Dead Man's Party deals
primarily with Buffy's reintegration into Sunnydale life and healing the rifts
caused by her time away. Marti Noxon wisely concentrates on making the viewers
empathise with Buffy's disorientating feelings of alienation. The zombies are
a distraction; a lazy sop to viewers expecting a fix of thrills and spills.<P>

This is really a &quot;taking care of business&quot; episode that ties up most of the
loose ends left over at the end of Season Two, notably the problem of how to
get Buffy back into school. It presents the perfect excuse to reintroduce
Snyder, who appears in a couple of nice scenes and is the target of a few
choice barbs even when he's not on screen.<P>

<B>Trivia </B><P>

The name of the demon, Ovu Mobani, is Nigerian for &quot;Evil Eye&quot;. It's not
entirely clear in the finished episode, but the demon was supposed to have the
power to paralyse his victims with a flash from his eyes.<P>

The episode s title, Dead Man s Party is perhaps a reference to the 1985 Oingo
Boingo song, which can be found on their album of the same name.<P>

Listen carefully to catch another sign of Giles' misspent youth: when he
hotwires his car after losing the keys in a scuffle with the zombies, he
mutters &quot;like riding a bloody bicycle!&quot;<P>
