On her way home from the Bronze, Buffy encounters three vampires, who've been
sent to avenge the death of one of the Master's minions. Just as they're about
to attack her, Angel appears and they begin to fight. Angel and Buffy manage
to make it safely to her house, where she repairs the wound he got in the
scuffle. He spends the night in her bedroom, sleeping next to her bed. The
next day at school, Giles identifies Buffy's attackers as warrior vampires,
and steps up her training in case a more serious melee takes place. Later that
day, Buffy and Angel share a passionate kiss, but then to her horror, she sees
that he is a vampire!<P>

Angel meets up with Darla, who was his lover and partner in crime hundreds of
years earlier. She chastises him for spending time with the Slayer. Meanwhile,
Giles identifies Angel as a 240-year-old vampire who came to America 80 years
ago, living alone and never killing again. Darla, anxious to do Buffy in, goes
to her house and pretends to be a student planning to study with her. Buffy's
mother, Joyce, lets her in and Darla promptly bites her in the neck. Angel
enters the house and tells Darla to let Joyce go. Darla passes Joyce to him
and he is tempted to bite her, but doesn't. When Buffy enters, she sees Angel
holding her mother and, assuming he is the one who bit Joyce, she tosses him
out the window. This finally gives her the impetus to kill him, and she meets
him at the Bronze with a crossbow. He explains that he did many heinous deeds
over the course of his lifetime, but his soul has been restored and he is now
haunted by them. Darla finds them together and tries to shoot Buffy. Angel
impales Darla from behind and she turns to dust. When the Master finds out
that Darla, his favourite, has been slain, he goes berserk, but the Annointed
One comforts him.<P>

Back at the Bronze, Angel and Buffy agree that despite their strong feelings
for each other, it's not realistic for them to pursue any kind of
relationship. They kiss goodbye and when Buffy walks away, the imprint of her
cross has been seared into Angel's chest.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

This episode begins with a nice piece of misdirection which suggests that the
story will be about the three armour-plated vampire warriors. A less kind
interpretation is that this part of the plot is simply padding. It's not long
before this story is hastily abandoned, and the focus moves firmly to Angel.<P>

At the beginning of the season, Angel seemed simply to be some sort of shadowy
plot device who would turn up to drop hints to Buffy when the team had
exhausted whatever leads they'd been pursuing. From this episode on, the
redefined relationship between Angel and Buffy forms the backbone of the
series. The revelations about Angel's past are only a taste of what's to come
and it quickly becomes apparent that his relationship with the Slayer is going
to be a troubled one. There's obvious chemistry between all the actors, not
least between Gellar and Boreanaz, who start to smoulder in this episode.<P>

The story is cleverly constructed, with several plot threads developing in
parallel. At times the switching between the different settings becomes
tiresome, and the pace seems to be maintained at the expense of frustrating
the viewer. Two scenes are especially well handled: Darla stalking Joyce
Summers, (&quot;Would you like something to eat?&quot;), and the kinetic, John Woo-style
battle at the end of the episode. It's a shame to see Darla written out,
especially as she was responsible for making Angel a vampire. &quot;Angel&quot; is a
pivotal episode, rich in character-building detail, and one that serves the
long-term interests of the series, but nevertheless it is rather mundane.<P>
