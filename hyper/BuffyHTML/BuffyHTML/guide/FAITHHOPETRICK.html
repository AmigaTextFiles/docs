A limo pulls into the drive-thru at Sunnydale's Happy Burger restaurant.
Inside the limo are not your ordinary customers, but rather vampires in search
of the Slayer. One of them has cloven hooves in place of hands. On the way to
their new hideout, one the vamps, Mr. Trick, picks up a diet soda... and the
drive-thru employee himself. Later that night, Buffy dreams that she is
dancing with Angel in the Bronze. During their dance, Buffy's claddagh ring
slips off her finger and falls to the floor. Angel picks it up and clutches it
in his hand, so tightly that blood starts to pour from his fist. As Buffy
watches in horror, more blood seeps from Angel's chest in the exact same spot
that she drive the sword through months ago.<P>

The next morning, Principal Snyder finally re-admits Buffy into Sunnydale
High, due to orders from the school board itself. Buffy needs to follow a few
conditions, one of which being her ability to pass make-up exams for all the
classes she missed last school year. A student again, Buffy visits the library
with Willow, where they find a variety of spell ingredients on the counter.
Giles tells Buffy that he needs to perform a binding spell on Acathla to make
sure the demon remains dormant. In order for the spell to work, Giles needs to
know the exact details of how Buffy defeated Acathla and Angel. Buffy lays out
the basics, leaving out the part where Angel's soul was restored. Later that
night at the Bronze, Buffy turns down a dance offer from Scott Hope, a fellow
student who's had his eyes on Buffy for a while. Cordelia points out an
interesting couple on the dance floor. As Buffy watches them dance, she begins
to suspect that the guy may be a vampire on the prowl. As they head out of the
Bronze, Buffy and her friends follow them out. Sure enough, the guy is a
vampire. What does take the group by surprise is the girl's handling of the
situation. Instead of screaming and trying to run for her life, the girl
proceeds to beat the crap out of the vampire, stopping momentarily to greet
Buffy by name and introduce herself as Faith. This new Slayer then takes the
stake out of Buffy's hand and finishes off the vamp before heading back
inside. While the group listens to Faith's wild stories, Cordelia finally puts
the pieces together and realizes that Faith was called forth in response to
Kendra's death. Faith is unlike Buffy, but she's different than Kendra also.
Kendra was always uptight and on the defensive, while Faith is much looser and
a little wild. During their conversation, Faith informs Buffy that her Watcher
is currently at an annual retreat.<P>

Unaware of this Watchers' retreat, Buffy takes Faith to the library to meet
Giles, who apparently has never been invited to any of the retreats. Buffy
invites Faith to dinner at her place. While Buffy takes one of her make-up
exams, Xander and Willow give Faith a tour of their school, pointing out all
the hot spots where they brushed with death. Elsewhere, in an abandoned
building, Mr. Trick explains to Kakistos how they could stay in Sunnydale and
still operate around the globe, thanks to the internet. Kakistos has no
interest in these matters. His only goal is to kill Faith, who caused the huge
scar running over his right eye.<P>

At the Summers home, Joyce is as impressed with Faith as the rest of Buffy's
friends are, if not more so. Buffy excuses herself from the dining table to
talk with her mom in the kitchen. Joyce suggests to Buffy that Faith could
take over her duties as the Slayer, but Buffy reminds her that it's her job
until she dies. Joyce is not happy to hear this, but she's slowly learning to
accept it. After dinner, Buffy and Faith patrol for vampires. During their
patrol, they get into an argument over Buffy's attitude towards Faith and the
apparent fact that she's holding something in. Suddenly, several vampires
attack the two Slayers. During the fight, Faith loses control on one vampire
and repeatedly pummels it without even thinking of finishing the job with a
stake. This leaves Buffy at the mercy of the other two vampires, who have her
pinned to the ground. As one of them moves in for the kill, he mentions a
name: Kakistos. Buffy succeeds in breaking their hold and killing one of them,
while the other gets away. She then pulls Faith off of the brutally beaten
vampire and dusts it with her stake. It seems Buffy isn't the only one with
personal problems.<P>

Buffy tells Giles about Faith's actions the next morning at school. She also
tells Giles what the vampire said to her, and Giles immediately recognizes the
name Kakistos. It's Greek for &quot;the worst of the worst&quot;. Kakistos is a vampire
who is so old that his hands have turned into cloven hooves. While Giles gets
on the phone to contact Faith's Watcher at the retreat, Buffy runs into Scott
in the hallway. He makes one last stab at trying to get Buffy out on a date.
Charmed by his efforts, Buffy finally accepts. Scott then hands Buffy a box,
saying it's a gift to represent their friendship. Buffy opens it and finds a
claddagh ring inside, exactly like the one Angel gave to her that night on the
docks. Overcome with emotion, Buffy drops the ring. As it hits the floor in
the exact same fashion that it did in her dream, Buffy backs out of her date
with Scott. Giles arrives and tries to help her, but Buffy insists she's okay.
Giles then reveals that Faith's Watcher is not at the retreat -- Faith's
Watcher is dead.<P>

Buffy tracks down Faith to a sleazy motel. Buffy informs her that Kakistos is
in town, which causes a look of fear and dread to wash over Faith's face. She
immediately starts packing and starts to head out. Buffy stops her by
mentioning her Watcher, who was killed by Kakistos. They hear a knock on the
door, and Faith opens it. They are greeted by Kakistos, Mr. Trick, and a few
of their cohort vampires. Buffy shuts the door and escapes out the back with
Faith. The vampires chase them into a building. Seemingly safe for now, Faith
explains that she witnessed Kakistos murdering her Watcher. Just then, Faith
notices a couple of dead bodies on the floor. Buffy realizes that they didn't
escape the vampires, but were instead driven into the building on purpose. As
the vampires start to converge on them, Buffy and Faith run into the middle of
the floor. Buffy takes on several vampires while Faith goes one-on-one with
Kakistos. Paralyzed with fear, Faith can't fight back while Kakistos grabs her
by the neck and repeatedly strikes her in the face. Buffy runs over to help,
while Mr. Trick and a female vampire decide to abandon their master and head
out into town on their own. Kakistos' body is so strong that Buffy's stake has
no effect on him. Faith takes a cue from Kakistos' mockery and picks up a huge
pointed beam. Before Kakistos can realize what she's doing, Faith drives it
straight through his heart, causing Kakistos to crumble into dust.<P>

The next day, the Watcher's council approves Giles' request to watch over both
Buffy and Faith until a new Watcher can be assigned to her. Unable to keep her
secret any longer, Buffy tells Giles and Willow the whole truth about what
happened that night in the mansion. She explains that Willow's attempt at the
restoration spell worked, and Angel was cured before Buffy drove the sword
through him and sent him to Hell. After she heads out, Giles tells Willow that
there never was a binding spell to perform on Acathla. He made the whole thing
up so that Buffy would finally vent out whatever's been eating at her from the
inside all this time. In the hallway, Buffy finds Scott and revives their
plans for their weekend date.<P>

Later that night, Buffy revisits the mansion where Angel, Spike, and Dru once
stayed. Back at the scene where Buffy kissed Angel for the last time, she
places the claddagh ring on the floor and bids her final farewell to Angel.
After she leaves, the floor of the mansion begins to rumble. A bright light
appears in the air, and the naked body of a man falls out from it and onto the
floor. He lies there, afraid and shivering. It's Angel, who has returned from
Hell... somehow.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

The first couple of episodes of this season were mainly concerned with tidying
up after Buffy and Angel's climactic battle, a lot of time was spent getting
things back to normal. 'Faith, Hope and Trick' injects new energy into the
show, restores the status quo and then spins things off in an entirely new
direction.<P>

David Greenwalt's script perfectly balances the elements jostling for space:
it advances the relationships of the key characters, introduces two important
new characters, (mercenary vampire Mister Trick and the deliciously kinky
Faith), and manages to throw in a couple of thrilling action scenes for good
measure.<P>

Even though we're told very little about Trick at this stage, there's a lot of
information to absorb about &quot;the new slayer in town&quot;. Even at this stage it's
clear that Faith is a very volatile presence, something that's sorely needed
to add zest to a show beginning to exhibit signs of running out of steam.<P>

It's a busy episode for Buffy, who restores her relationship with Giles (by
admitting that Angel had been cured when she slew him); admits to her mother
that she died during her confrontation with The Master (in <A href=PROPHECYGIRL.html>Prophecy Girl</A>); and
has finally let go of Angel... or so she thinks!<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

One of Joss Whedon's ideas for the series is that the older a vampire gets,
the more animalistic they become. Two vampires that Buffy has encountered have
exhibited signs of this: The Master, whose features were bat-like, and
Kakistos, who has cloven feet and hands. It's also worth remembering that
traditionally the Devil has been depicted with cloven feet, indeed, he's often
goat-like from the waist down.<P>

Pop Culture 1: the reference &quot;Makes D.C. look like Mayberry&quot; refers to the
setting of the popular CBS TV series 'The Andy Griffith Show' (a.k.a. 'Andy of
Mayberry'). It featured the adventures of a small-town Sheriff, and ran from
1960-68 before it s star departed and the show was renamed 'Mayberry RFD'.<P>

Pop Culture 2: Buffy's complaint &quot;I'm the one getting Single White Femaled
here&quot; is a reference to the 1992 movie 'Single White Female', which starred
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridget Fonda as flatmates. In the film Leigh's
character begins to psychotically copy every aspect of Fonda's life.<P>

A third semi-regular character is introduced in this episode: Buffy's new
squeeze Scott Hope (Fab Fillipo).<P>
