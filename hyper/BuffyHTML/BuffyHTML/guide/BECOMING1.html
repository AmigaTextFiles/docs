<P><B>Becoming - Part One</B>
<BR>5V21<P>
<HR>
<P>
Galway, 1753 -- On his last day as a mortal human, the man who will become
Angelus encounters a beautiful, blonde woman on the streets at night. Her name
is Darla, and she seduces him closer to her. She sinks her fangs into his
neck, then uses her nails to make an incision on her chest, just above her
breasts. Immediately, Darla pulls the man's mouth onto her bleeding cut,
turning the man into a demon of the night.<P>

Sunnydale, Present -- Angel watches Buffy from afar as she battles a pair of
vampires. She orders one of them to take a message to Angel, saying that she's
taking the offensive. The vampire doesn't comply, so Buffy finishes him off.
The next day, Giles pays a visit to the museum, where a newly-discovered stone
artifact has been discovered. It is a few feet taller than Giles, and it
contains some form of text on the side. Giles asks the man in charge, Doug
Perren, if they attempted to open it yet, but Doug didn't notice the crack
running down the side of the stone until Giles pointed it out. Giles then asks
Doug to refrain from opening it until he can decipher the text. At school,
Buffy declares to her friends for the umpteenth time that she's ready to face
Angel, despite the fact that final exams are approaching. Willow offers to
tutor Buffy in chemistry during one of their free periods.<P>

London, 1860 -- Before she became a demon, Drusilla was a young Catholic woman
who only wanted to follow the right path in life. She enters a church and
steps into the confessional booth, failing to notice one of the priest's arms
reaching out in desperation before being pulled back in. Drusilla does not
realize that Angelus has just murdered the priest and is now acting in his
place behind the confessional screen. After Drusilla tells him of her problem
with her visions of the future, Angelus torments her by claiming that she is a
child of the devil. Drusilla does not want this to be true, and pleads for
help. Finally, Angelus lets her go with a request for Hail Mary's and an act
of contrition.<P>

Sunnydale, Present -- Drusilla, Spike, and Angelus read about the museum's new
artifact in the newspaper. Angelus knows what it is immediately. Back in
Sunnydale High, Buffy hopelessly tries to solve a chemistry problem when she
accidentally drops her pencil. It rolls off into the desk and falls on the
floor, right next to Ms. Calendar's disk which has remained their ever since
the night of her murder. Buffy pulls the disk out and hands it to Willow, and
pops it into the disk drive to check out its contents. What they find is
Jenny's final project: the curse for the restoration of Angel's soul.
Meanwhile, Dru, Angel, and several other vamps go to the museum to retrieve
the stone, killing Doug Perren in the process.<P>

Rumanian Woods, 1898 -- The dead body of a gypsy girl lays stretched out on
the ground next to a fire, while an elder gypsy woman chants the curse of
restoration. Glowing beneath her is an Orb of Thesulah. While she chants the
curse, Angelus flees through the woods, trying to escape the scene of the
crime, for he is the one responsible for the girl's death. The elder woman
completes the curse, and Angelus is stopped in his tracks. He falls to his
knees, and his eyes glow as his soul returns to his body for the first time in
over a century. A gypsy man steps out of the woods and explains to Angel that
he is being punished for the countless murders he has committed.<P>

Sunnydale, Present -- Buffy and Willow show Giles a printout of the
restoration curse. Giles claims that the curse would require a great knowledge
of the black arts, and Willow feels that she's up to the challenge. While
everyone talks of Angel's salvation, only Xander is upset, for he feels that
Angel must pay for his murders with his life. Xander gets into an argument
with Giles over Jenny's last wish before telling Buffy that she's willing to
forget all about the murders in order to get her beloved Angel back.
Elsewhere, Angel tells Spike the story of a demon named Acathla. This demon
possesses the power to literally swallow the Earth into Hell, but he was
stopped by a knight centuries ago. His body turned to stone with the sword
still embedded in it, then was concealed in the stone tomb and buried deep
beneath the ground. With that, two vampires open the tomb, revealing the body
of Acathla inside. Only someone worthy can remove the sword from Acathla's
body, freeing him to reign terror on the world. Later that night, Buffy finds
the claddagh ring that Angel gave to her before he lost his soul. She goes
outside for a walk and encounters Kendra, who has returned to take care of
another dark force in Sunnydale. At the library, Kendra shows them a valuable
weapon that she brought with her. It is a sword that was blessed by the same
knight who stopped Acathla. If Angel succeeds in reviving the demon, it may be
their only chance to stop it. Buffy asks Willow to perform the curse as soon
as possible, but they need an Orb of Thesulah first. Luckily, Giles already
has one in his office.<P>

Manhattan, 1996 -- Angel stumbles through the streets of Manhattan, living
like a bum ever since he regained his soul. He is approached by another demon
named Whistler who says he too is on the good side. Whistler offers Angel a
chance to pick himself up from this foul life and become someone important in
the world. But first, Angel has to see something before he can make his
decision.<P>

Los Angeles, 1996 -- A car with windows painted black parks outside of Hemery
High, and Angel rolls the window down just enough to see what he came there
for: the Chosen One. He observes Buffy's first meeting with a Watcher, then
follows her to the cemetery where she first learns the truth about vampires
and her destiny in life. Angel also follows Buffy to her home, where her
mother is upset because Buffy got home late. Buffy goes to the bathroom and
listens to her parents arguing with each other. Having seen enough, Angel asks
Whistler to help him to a better life, teach him to become somebody.<P>

Sunnydale, Present -- A human sacrifice is brought before Angelus, who
promptly feeds on his blood, making sure to spread some on the palm of his
right hand. Angelus then approaches the body of Acathla, reciting the
incantations for the ritual of his revival. Angelus grabs the sword and pulls
it with all his might, but he fails. Spike is amused at Angelus's failure, and
Dru is very upset. Angelus then swears that they will turn to an old friend,
and then succeed.<P>

The next day, Buffy and the others take one of their final exams, unaware that
a concealed vampire is walking down the hallway toward their classroom. The
vampire steps into the room, and smoke begins to rise from her body as the
rays of sunlight hit it. She warns Buffy that more will die if she does not
meet Angel that night. As she finishes the message, her body disintegrates.
Buffy tells Willow to perform the curse, leaving Kendra behind to stand guard.
Buffy finds Angel at the cemetery, and they begin to fight. Meanwhile, a group
of vampires invades the library during the restoration ritual. Back at the
cemetery, Buffy realizes that her fight with Angel is merely a diversionary
tactic, so she turns and runs towards the school as fast as she can. While
Kendra battles one of the vampires, another one pushes a bookshelf over,
crushing Willow underneath. Xander fights another one, but it brutally breaks
his right arm before he can shake him off. After Kendra slays a vamp, she
attacks another that has knocked out Giles. As they surround her, Cordelia
escapes from the library, while Willow lays unconscious under the bookshelf.
Drusilla then enters and takes on Kendra one-on-one. Kendra is no match for
Dru, who defends all of her attacks before hypnotizing the Slayer into an
immobile trance. Dru then slashes a cut in Kendra's neck with her nails.
Kendra falls to the ground as blood pours out of her neck.<P>

Taking Giles with them, the vampires leave the library only moments before
Buffy bursts into the school hallways. She finally makes it to the library,
but it is too late. She runs over to Kendra's fallen body, but there's nothing
she can do. Suddenly, the police arrive to see Buffy over the body of a dead
woman. One of them aims a gun at Buffy, ordering her to freeze. Buffy's
disastrous night has just gotten worse... <a HREF="BECOMING2.html">[to be continued...]</A><P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

Joss Whedon's two-part season finale is a treat for long-term viewers. It's
loaded with continuity references, as well as presenting on screen for the
first time events mentioned in previous episodes: Darla turning Angel into a
vampire in 1753 Galway (<A href=ANGEL.html>Angel</A>), Angel's mental torture of Drusilla <A href=LIETOME.html>Lie To Me</A>,
and Angel being cursed by the gypsies (<A href=ANGEL.html>Angel</A>, <A href=SURPRISE.html>Surprise</A> and <A href=INNOCENCE.html>Innocence</A>). We also
get to witness Buffy's tentative first staking, which is an episode highlight,
and see Merrick, Buffy's original Watcher, for the first time in the series,
(the character was featured in the movie version, where he was played by
Donald Sutherland). There's also a real sense of déjà vu about this episode,
as elements of <A href=INNOCENCE.html>Innocence</A> and <A href=WHENSHEWASBAD.html>When She Was Bad</A> are brazenly recycled. It must
all be rather for confusing for casual viewers!<P>

Buffy's fellow Slayer, Kendra (from <A href=WHATSMYLINE1.html>What's My Line</A>), and Darla (the Master's
minion, who was killed in <A href=ANGEL.html>Angel</A>) return, but sadly, neither is given much to
do. Bringing Kendra back only to have her killed off, seems rather a waste,
particularly as the death of a Slayer could have been the theme of a whole
episode.<P>

There's also a new character to complicate things: Whistler (played by Max
Perlich, better known as the photographer, Brodie, in 'Homicide - Life on the
Street'). Whistler is a meddlesome demon, and it's not clear what his
motivations are for becoming involved. This is perhaps intentional - after
all, he does say &quot;Nobody understands me, that's my curse!&quot; - but it remains
rather perplexing. Writer Joss Whedon seems more than usually preoccupied with
plotting, resulting in an episode that lacks his usual vitality.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

This episode presents another date in the Angel chronology, and one that
doesn't sit easily with ones mentioned in previous episodes. It's here
established that Darla turned the adult Angel into a vampire in 1753.
<A href=HALLOWEEN.html>Halloween</A> has him being eighteen years old in 1775, which makes his date of
birth around 1756. This episode also contradicts the date that Angel's soul
was restored. In <A href=ANGEL.html>Angel</A> it was implied that it happened in the 1920s. Here it's
stated as having taken place in Romania, in 1898. Pop culture: Buffy
mispronounces Acathla as 'Alfalfa', the name of a cheeky child character from
Hal Roach's long-running series of 'Our Gang' movies, (they began in 1922, and
ended in 1944). The Alfalfa character, played by Carl Switzer, appeared in the
series from 1935 to 1942. In 1955 the series was re-titled, for legal reasons,
to 'The Little Rascals', and sold to American television, where it has
remained a popular staple ever since.<P>

Buffy and Willow find Jenny's computer disc, the one that was misplaced at the
end of <A href=PASSION.html>Passion</A><P>

If the building for Hemery High, Buffy's previous school, looks familiar, it
may be because it was also used as the clock tower in the 'Back To The Future'
movies.<P>
