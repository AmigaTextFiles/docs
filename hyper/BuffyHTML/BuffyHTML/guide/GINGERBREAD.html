On a typical night of patrol and slaying, Buffy's routine is unexpectedly
interrupted by the arrival of her mother. Joyce feels that it's time to get a
better understanding of her daughter's world by watching Buffy in action.
Almost as soon as Joyce arrives, a vampire enters the scene. After Buffy
chases him into the thick of the woods, Joyce discovers the bodies of two dead
children, one boy and one girl, at a nearby playground. A strange symbol has
been enscribed in the palms of their hands. While the police investigate the
crime scene, Buffy tries to console her distraught mother.<P>

Buffy tells Giles about the murdered children in the library the next morning.
She sketches the symbol she noticed on their palms and shows it to Giles, who
believes it implies the handiwork of a cult. Buffy cannot believe that humans
are responsible for this as opposed to demons. At lunch, nobody notices Joyce
walking into the cafeteria and straight to the gang's table. Buffy excuses
herself and takes her mom into the hallway. Joyce tells her daughter that
she's organized a meeting at City Hall for that night to discuss the murder.<P>

Dozens of parents attend, including Sheila Rosenberg, Willow's mother. Willow
can't believe she's there, considering the fact that they barely communicate
with each other. After the Mayor delivers a textbook speech to the crowd, he
invites Joyce to the stand to lead them in a moment of silence. Instead, Joyce
proposes a call to action, declaring an end to the city's silence concerning
the ubiquitous dangers that plague Sunnydale. Later that night, Willow, Amy,
and their friend Michael gather together to explore their world of the black
arts. On the floor beneath them is the very same symbol that appeared on the
two dead children.<P>

At school the next morning, a group of students harass Michael by his locker,
stating their belief that witches were responsible for the children's murder.
Amy tries to fend them off, but it's Buffy who gets them to back off. Giles
finds Buffy and tells her that witches may in fact be the prime suspects. The
book that Giles needs to research this further was checked out by Willow, so
he asks Buffy to get it for him. Buffy finds Xander sitting in the lounge, who
points out Willow's stuff.<P>

As she picks up the book, Buffy notices the symbol drawn on Willow's notebook.
She asks Willow to explain it, but their conversation is cut short by the
sudden commotion in the hallways. Under Principal Synder's supervision, the
local police inspect each and every locker, looking for any signs of materials
pertaining to witchcraft. After Amy is escorted to the office, Willow tells
Buffy that the symbol is for a protection spell that she wanted to cast for
Buffy's upcoming birthday. In other words, the symbol and what it stands for
are completely harmless. At that moment, the cops open Willow's locker and ask
her to come with them. Buffy runs to the library and discovers a similar
scene. As the cops pack up all of Giles' books concerning the supernatural,
Buffy tells him about the misleading symbol.<P>

Later that night, Buffy argues with her mother, who is the founder of MOO
(Mothers Opposed to the Occult). Buffy insists that this matter be dealt with
by the Slayer. However, Joyce doesn't believe that Buffy's work is making
Sunnydale any better. After Buffy takes off, the two deceased children appear
in the kitchen... very much alive. Joyce listens to them intently as they beg
her to make their murderers suffer. Meanwhile, Sheila grounds Willow for
getting into trouble at school. She orders her daughter to stay in her room
for the rest of the night.<P>

At the park, Angel finds Buffy standing by the scene of the crime, which is
now decorated with flowers, candles, and pictures of the children from a time
when they were still alive. Buffy has not forgotten her mother's criticism of
the Slayer's effectiveness. Angel reassures Buffy that her destiny is not in
vain. During their conversation, Angel inadvertently alerts Buffy to a mystery
concerning the two children. She heads to the library and finds Giles, Xander,
and Oz trying to find any useful information on the internet. Buffy shares her
realization that nobody seems to know anything about the two children,
including their names or where they came from, and yet their pictures were
somehow available for use in MOO's campaign. Oz sends an instant message to
Willow, who then begins to search the web for any files or articles relating
to the two children. Apparently, the dead bodies of these same two children
have been repeatedly discovered once every fifty years, dating all the way
back to 1649. The oldest article identifies them as Hans and Greta Strauss.<P>

Unfortunately, Sheila cuts off Willow's computer access at this moment,
forcing Giles and the gang to figure the rest out on their own. Giles recalls
a theory that many fairy tales are based on actual accounts of the
supernatural. Buffy fills in the blanks, recalling the story of Hansel and
Gretel, who must have been based on Hans and Greta. Suddenly, Michael bursts
into the library and tells everybody that he was attacked by his own family.
He also informs them that Amy was taken from her home. Xander and Oz head
towards Willow's house while Buffy and Giles race back to the Summers home to
warn everybody. Back at the Rosenberg's, Willow answers the knocking at her
door and finds her mother... along with a group of angry parents who want
nothing but her death. Meanwhile, Buffy and Giles interrupt another MOO
meeting. As they take Joyce into the foyer to speak with her alone, the rest
of the group sneak up from behind and knock Giles unconscious. Joyce does the
same to Buffy with the help of some chloroform.<P>

Buffy, Willow, and Amy are tied to large stakes in City Hall, ready to be
burned for the crimes they've been accused of. Willow and Amy unsuccessfully
struggle with their restraints, while Buffy remains unconscious. Meanwhile,
Xander and Oz burst into Willow's room, which was left a total mess in the
wake of the angry parents. As they leave for City Hall, Giles is awoken by an
impatient Cordelia, who came to the house to find out what was going on. They
hurry to Giles' car and speed towards City Hall. During the drive, Giles has
Cordy mix together the ingredients for a spell while he tries to recall the
incantation from memory. Back at City Hall, Buffy finally regains
consciousness and realizes the situation she's in. Joyce refuses to listen to
her daughter's pleas. Amy escapes danger by transforming herself into a rat
and bolting out of the room, but Willow and Buffy are still moments away from
a fiery death. Just as the fire is about to engulf Buffy and Willow, Giles and
Cordy burst into the room. While Cordy extinguishes the fire, Giles casts the
spell on the two children, who then combine and change into the true form of a
tall, hideous demon. As the parents realize the deception and try to escape,
Xander and Oz approach the scene via a ventilation shaft above the ceiling.
Without the help of the parents, the demon attempts to kill Buffy and Willow
directly and charges them. Buffy breaks the stake she's been tied to in half
and leans forward -- just in time to impale the demon. The silence that
follows is soon interrupted by the sight and sound of Xander and Oz falling
down through a weak spot in the ceiling and crashing down onto the floor.<P>

A while after their near-death experience, Buffy and Willow discuss Sheila
Rosenberg's convenient memory loss concerning the demon, just like the way
Joyce Summers' memory used to operate before learning that her daughter was
the Slayer. Willow then makes another attempt at restoring the Amy rat to
human form. Unfortunately, Willow is going to need a little more practice
before she can pull this one off.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

The pacing of this episode is almost perfect, slowly building an uncomfortable atmosphere of intolerance and hatred. This bubbles over into bullying, overzealous state intervention and ultimately, into mob rule. It's a chilling scenario, made more intense by seeing how the series' most sympathetic and innocent character, Willow, is caught up in wild - if not entirely unfounded - accusations of witchcraft.<P>

The episode regularly strikes a sensitive nerve. The restriction of personal liberties ("Oh man, it's Nazi Germany and I've got Playboys in my locker!"), the formation of vigilante groups ("Mothers Opposed to the Occult...a powerful new group") and the confiscation of books ("He'll get most of them back") provides plenty of dramatic potential, and, given a unique "BtVS" twist, forms the backbone for a fascinating story.<P>

Jane Espensen's script consistently strikes the right tone, coating events with a veneer of humour (The 'MOO' acronym, Xander's Playboy stash and Sheila Rosenberg's reference to 'Bunny' Summers) that prevents the episode from slipping into darker territory. The tense finale, where Buffy, Willow and Amy are tied to stakes and threatened with being burnt as witches, is beautifully staged and directed. In an especially neat touch the pyre is made up of the contents of Giles' library, combining book burning with cruel and unusual punishment. Only the annoying and unnecessary addition of Willow's mother adds a sour note to an otherwise almost perfect episode.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

The Hansel and Gretel story as we know it now first appeared in Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's collection of fairy tales, published between 1812 and 1815. However, Grimm's stories were based on folk tales that had previously been perpetuated by oral storytelling traditions. In 'Gingerbread' the first occurrence of the myth is traced specifically to 1649, but this seems to be where the facts and 'BtVS' version of events part company...<P>

Pop culture 1: Snyder's gleeful "I love the smell of desperate librarian in the morning" is an adaptation of a famous line from Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Vietnam war movie 'Apocalypse Now', in which a hyped-up Lieutenant Colonel (played by Robert Duvall) is supervising an air raid on the Vietcong: "I love the smell of napalm in the morning".<P>

Pop culture 2: Willow and her mother discuss the 'Mister Rogers' puppet show, and one of the show's characters, King Friday. This is a reference to 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood', an educational children's show - and something of an American institution - that has been running since 1965.<P>
