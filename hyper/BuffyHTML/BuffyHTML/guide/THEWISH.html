<HR>
<P>
Ridding Sunnydale of one slimy demon provides little distraction for Buffy,
Xander, and Willow, who are still coping with the aftermath of their
relationship woes. Cordy is taking it the hardest, ignoring the vast amount of
answering machine messages left by Xander while burning all the pictures of
her ex-boyfriend.<P>

The next morning, Willow tries once again to patch up her relationship with
Oz. Unfortunately, he needs some space and time to make any decisions on the
matter. Cordelia arrives at school dressed to kill, but she soon learns that
all of her old friends still have no respect for her, even after Xander Harris
has left the picture. Harmony introduces Cordy to Anya, a new girl in town,
before harshly insulting her former best friend. Anya takes an immediate
interest in Cordy's personal troubles. Later that night, Cordy and Anya go to
the Bronze, where Xander is also in attendance, along with Buffy and Willow.
After getting up to fetch a few drinks, Buffy notices Cordy abruptly exiting,
so she follows her into the alley. Before Buffy can get Cordelia to open up
and vent her problems, a vampire intervenes. The ensuing fight sends Cordy
into a nearby pile of trash. With the last straw exposed, Cordelia identifies
Buffy as the source of all of her troubles. As she explains to Anya the next
day, none of the bad things in Cordy's life would have ever happened if Buffy
never came to Sunnydale. Anya removes her necklace and places it around
Cordy's neck. Cordy declares her wish that Buffy never made that fateful trip.
At this point, Anya reveals herself to be not quite human and says, &quot;Done.&quot; A
bright light flashes, and suddenly the Sunnydale High campus is much less
crowded than it was a moment ago.<P>

Cordelia quickly realizes that Anya must have granted her wish. However, this
new version of Sunnydale is not as ideal as she imagined it would be. There's
a city curfew that coincides with sunset. The Bronze is no longer the place to
be at night. And Xander and Willow, as Harmony tells her, are dead.<P>

Night falls as Cordelia wanders the deserted streets of Sunnydale. She
encounters Xander and tells him that they have to get Buffy. Willow arrives,
and Cordy learns that they are now vampires. Before Xander can kill her, a
familiar van pulls up to the scene of the inevitable crime. Giles gets out,
warding Xander and Willow off with a cross. Behind him, Oz sits in the
driver's seat with a crossbow aimed at the vamps. Larry and a girl named Nancy
get out of the van and pull Cordy to safety. Giles gets back inside, and the
van takes off. Cordelia is brought to the library, which serves as the main
base for the resistance against the vampires. Meanwhile, Xander and Willow
return to the Bronze, which is now the headquarters for The Master and his
minions. The Master orders Xander and Willow to kill Cordelia before she can
contact the Slayer and interfere with his latest scheme. Back at the library,
Cordy finally comes to and tells Giles about her wish and that they need
Buffy. Unfortunately, neither of them realize that Xander and Willow have
infiltrated the library. Locked inside the bookcage, Giles can only hopelessly
watch as Xander and Willow sink their fangs into Cordelia, draining her of all
of her blood. After the vampires leave, Giles uses an axe from his weapons
cabinet to bust open the cage. Larry and Oz arrive, informing Giles that Nancy
is now dead. As they pick up Cordy's lifeless body to bring to the
incinerator, Giles notices her necklace and removes it.<P>

The next morning, Willow plays around with Angel, who the Master has locked up
in the basement of the Bronze as punishment. At the library, Giles discovers
through his books that the necklace represents Anyanka, the &quot;Patron Saint of
Scorned Women&quot;. He realizes that Anyanka must have granted a wish that Cordy
made which resulted in the world they're living in right now. Giles calls
Buffy's Watcher in Cleveland and leaves a message.<P>

While driving down the streets later that night, Giles sees some vampires
packing a group of humans into the back of a truck. He wards them off with the
cross, enabling the humans to escape. However, he is knocked down from behind.
Before the vampires can finish him, another challenger enters the fray. Giles
watches the vampires face defeat at the hands of this newcomer, then realizes
that this new girl is the one and only Buffy Summers. After taking her back to
his apartment, Giles informs her of what he's learned concerning Anyanka. In
order to reverse all of her wishes and render her powerless, Anyanka's
powercenter must be destroyed. Buffy is clearly uninterested in this, and is
more concerned with taking out the Master.<P>

Buffy goes to the Bronze, which is now deserted. In the basement, she finds
Angel locked up behind bars. While she doesn't recognize him, Angel knows
exactly who she is from all the time he spent secretly observing her in Los
Angeles. Angel leads Buffy to a factory where the Master has unveiled a
machine that will revolutionize the lifestyle of vampires everywhere. This
device can drain a person's body of all of its blood and dispense it into
glasses and cups in mere seconds. Buffy and Angel step in to put a stop to the
festivities. While Buffy fights the vampires head-on, Angel frees the human
prisoners. In the course of the battle, Angel, Xander, and Willow are dusted.
While Buffy continues to fight, Giles summons Anyanka and identifies her
glowing necklace as her powercenter. As he rips it from her neck and prepares
to smash it, the Master overpowers Buffy and snaps her neck, fulfilling the
prophecy in the Pergamum Codex in this reality as well. Giles smashes the
necklace, and suddenly Cordelia is standing in front of Anya again. Anya
realizes that she is no longer able to grant Cordy's wish. As Cordy walks off,
she passes by Buffy, Xander, and Willow, who are still alive and well.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

The parallel universe story has a long tradition in telefantasy TV series. In dramatic terms it's a gift to writers: a chance to throw away the rulebook, and an opportunity to explore the kinkier aspects of the series' characters without upsetting established continuity in any lasting way. They also present actors with a golden opportunity to bring new dimensions to characters that they may have been playing for years with little leeway, so it's not surprising that such episodes often end up being fan favourites.
<P>
'The Wish' upholds this fine tradition in spades. Before the end of the episode we're offered the return of the Master, vampire versions of Willow and Xander - feasting on Cordelia while Giles watches helplessly, no less - Willow torturing Angel, a cynical, battle scarred Buffy and several regular cast members being killed.
<P>
'The Wish' also has another plot device common to most parallel universe stories: fish-out-of-water characters who know that something is amiss (in this case Cordelia and, to a lesser extent, Angel). If all this wish fulfilment wasn't enough, this episode also deals with the fallout from the scene in 'Lover's Walk' where Oz and Cordelia discover Willow and Xander canoodling, (the catalyst for the whole wish scenario).
<P>
<B>Trivia</B>
<P>
How to trace the history of the parallel universe story? Maybe the first literary example is Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland', which finds Alice in a strange fantasyland populated by characters resembling those that the real Alice knew. (Of course, it could be argued that this is a matter of interpretation, since it's not obvious from an isolated reading of the book). A similar device is used in L.Frank Baum's 1900 story The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.
<P>
Perhaps the best-known example in cinema is the 1946 classic 'It's a Wonderful Life', which tells the uplifting story of a humble, suicidal man (the wonderful James Stewart) who is shown how the world would have been different if he'd never been born. Many science fiction TV shows have utilised the idea: The 1970 Doctor Who story 'Inferno' saw the Doctor visiting a parallel world where Totalitarianism was rampant. The TV series 'Sliders' used the parallel universe theme. 'Star Trek' has a whole sub-series of parallel universe stories, beginning with the 1967 episode 'Mirror Mirror' and revived and mined for all it was worth by the 90s variant 'Star Trek - Deep Space 9'.
