At the ground-breaking ceremony for the new Cultural Partnership Center at UC
Sunnydale, Dean Guerrero introduces the curator of the new facility, Professor
Gerhardt. After finishing her speech, Prof. Gerhardt turns the digging duties
over to the nearby workers, one of whom is Xander. No sooner does the digging
begin when the ground gives way beneath Xander's feet, causing him to fall
into an underground chamber. It is the remains of a lost Sunnydale mission
that was buried by an earthquake in 1812. Later that night, Buffy senses a
mysterious presence somewhere outside of the dorm, but she can't place her
finger on what it is. Unbeknownst to Buffy, Angel has arrived in Sunnydale to
follow up on a foreshadowing vision that his partner had. Knowing only that
Buffy will encounter some great danger in the near future, Angel stands hidden
in the bushes outside of Stevenson Hall, staring up at the window of his
former love's room. Turning back to her roommate, Buffy decides that they
should have their own Thanksgiving celebration, seeing how Joyce is out of
town for the holidays. Although she is opposed to the genocidal history of
Thanksgiving, Willow agrees to the plans for her friend's sake. Buffy then
decides to hold the dinner at Giles' home.<P>

Elsewhere, Riley, Forrest, and Graham decide to give up their search mission
for the time being. Forrest reminds them that Spike can't hurt anybody. Sure
enough, Spike has seen better nights as he desperately tries to survive on an
empty stomach. Meanwhile, Anya visits Xander's place to find out why he hasn't
returned to the digging site. She soon realizes that Xander is overwhelmingly
sick. As Anya tends to Xander's needs, a green mist rises from the Sunnydale
mission site and drifts into Prof. Gerhardt's office. Settling over a display
case that contains an early 1800 Chumash knife, the mist materializes into an
Indian spirit warrior named Hus. Before she can make a sound, Prof. Gerhardt
is grabbed by the invader and sliced at the neck by the jagged edge of the
knife.<P>

Buffy and Willow investigate Prof. Gerhardt's office the next day, looking for
any clues concerning the nature of the attack. While Willow tries to figure
out why one of Gerhardt's ears was missing from the corpse, Buffy notices the
empty spot in the display case where the knife once rested. Afterwards, Buffy
unpacks several bags of groceries in Giles' kitchen while she describes the
findings at the office. Giles is familiar with the Chumash tribe, but he can't
explain why a peaceful group would be involved in Gerhardt's murder. On her
way out, Buffy is momentarily stopped by the same sense she experienced
earlier. After Buffy brushes it off and leaves, Giles calls Angel out of
hiding to talk about the murder. Angel recommends contacting Father Gabriel,
who may know more about what's going on. When Giles expresses his discomfort
with keeping Buffy in the dark, Angel insists that knowledge of his presence
would only distract Buffy and make her more vulnerable.<P>

Downtown, Buffy and Willow shop for the remaining items on the Thanksgiving
dinner list. When Riley appears to talk to Buffy about his trip home to Iowa
for the holiday, Willow leaves the two alone and enters the nearby coffee
shop. Inside, she encounters Angel, who quickly fills Willow in on the details
concerning his return to Sunnydale.<P>

Meanwhile, Spike tries to find comfort in Harmony's arms, but she refuses to
let him reenter her life. Later, Buffy follows Giles' referral to Father
Gabriel's church. What she finds is the hanging corpse of Father Gabriel,
along with an Indian warrior cutting off the body's ear. Buffy engages in
battle, but Hus' declaration of vengeance for his people's suffering causes
Buffy to break off the fight.<P>

On the morning of Thanksgiving, Buffy tries to prepare the dinner while Giles
and Willow get into an ethical debate over what to do with Hus. Having
researched the persecution of the Chumash people nearly two centuries ago,
Willow ponders the idea of trying to help Hus in some way. On the other hand,
Giles acknowledges the fact that Hus has murdered two innocent people and
needs to be stopped. Xander and Anya arrive, arousing numerous questions about
his deteriorating health. When Willow and the others conclude that Hus is
inflicting that which was done to his people, Xander is diagnosed with the
same diseases that befell the Chumash people: malaria, smallpox, syphilis, and
so on. Suddenly, another knock at the door concerns the group. Buffy and Giles
open the door to find a desperate Spike, who offers information on the
Initiative in exchange for shelter and food. After tying Spike to a chair,
Buffy sends Willow, Xander and Anya to warn Dean Guerrero of a possible
attack. Unfortunately, their warning falls on disbelieving ears, and the trio
find themselves heading back in defeat. Suddenly, Angel appears, much to the
shock of Xander. Angel quickly figures out that Buffy is Hus' next target,
leading the group to race back to Giles' place immediately.<P>

A barrage of arrows signals the invasion of Hus and several Chumash warriors
that he has summoned. As Buffy and Giles duck for cover, Spike is impaled by
several projectiles, each narrowly missing his heart. When Willow, Xander, and
Anya return, Hus decides to give up the arrow attack and challenge Buffy
face-to-face. While the gang futilely tries to fend off the invulnerable
attackers, Angel arrives to help turn the tide. Back inside, Buffy learns that
Hus' knife is the only thing that can wound him. Hus transforms into a large
bear in an attempt to overpower Buffy, but the Slayer manages to fatally stab
Hus with his own knife. Dissolving into green mist, Hus and the other Chumash
disappear.<P>

Now that Thanksgiving dinner has finally commenced, Buffy tries to look on the
bright side of things. However, a steadily recovering Xander accidentally
spills the beans on Angel's assistance, casting a spell of silence over the
stunned Slayer.<P>

<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
'Pangs' is part one of a two-part Buffy/Angel crossover storyline (it had to happen, didn't it, really). I got hold of a small synopsis for the conclusion, which is actually an 'Angel' episode, 'I Will Remember You!' (1ADH08), but is kinda Buffy-relevant...
<P>
When Angel tells Cordy and Doyle that he did not contact Buffy during his visit to Sunnydale, Buffy pays a visit and expresses her displeasure. Sparks fly. As they are about to part their separate ways, a medieval demon charges into Angel's office and a violent brawl ensues. The demon escapes, and Buffy and Angel decide to pursue it separately. When Angel makes contact and kills him, he observes that he has human characteristics. The Powers that Be confirm that Angel is indeed human again. Angel pursues Buffy and they share a passionate night of romance. But the next day, they are confronted by a stronger version of the medieval demon, and Angel is unable to fight in his human form. After hearing that Buffy would perish if he were to remain human, he begs the Powers That Be to transform him into a vampire so that he can protect her. They do so, and Angel breaks the news to a heartbroken Buffy. However, their blessed reunion will remain only in Angel's memory...
