While Dingoes Ate My Baby performs onstage at the Bronze, Willow listens to
Buffy discuss her relationship with Parker, who is playing a game of pool not
too far away. On his way out, Parker offers to walk Buffy back to the dorm,
and she readily accepts. Outside, while Devon and Oz load their equipment into
the van, Willow encounters Harmony for the first time since graduation.
Suddenly, a sharp pain strikes Willow's neck as she discovers that Harmony is
now a vampire, feeding off of her former classmate.<P>

Before Harmony can take too much blood, Oz pulls her off of Willow, who
immediately raises her cross. Harmony takes off, but not before warning Willow
and Oz that her own boyfriend is going to be fairly upset. Meanwhile, Parker
and Buffy discuss their pasts while walking to Stevenson Hall. When Parker
notices the scar on her neck, Buffy tosses out a cover story about an angry
puppy. Parker then tells Buffy that his father died a year ago. Stopping for a
moment, Parker asks Buffy to join him at an upcoming party at one of the frat
houses. Upon finally arriving at room 214 in Stevenson Hall, Parker and Buffy
move in for a goodbye kiss. Their lips never touch, for Oz and Willow rush
down the hallway to tell Buffy about Harmony. After Parker leaves, Willow
describes the event while Oz cleans the wound and applies a band-aid. Little
do they know that Harmony's boyfriend is none other than Spike.<P>

The next morning, deep beneath the streets of Sunnydale, Spike goes over the
city plans, planning his next course of tunneling. Frustrated and bored,
Harmony persuades Spike to take her to a party for some fresh food. Later that
night, while working a part-time job at Giles' apartment, Xander gets a
surprise visit from Anya. Under the impression that they're a couple, Anya
tells Xander about his constant presence in her dreams. Shocked and confused,
Xander tries to convince Anya that they don't have a relationship. At the
party, Parker and Buffy run into Spike and Harmony. After some brief
introductions, Spike flees the scene. Buffy follows him outside and gets into
a sparring-and-trash-talking session. Harmony arrives shortly, explaining that
Drusilla left Spike once again. Before Spike can retreat, Harmony mentions the
Gem of Amara. Furious, Spike grabs Harmony and leaves.<P>

Buffy heads to the nearest phone and calls Giles to tell him about Spike,
Harmony, and the Gem of Amara. Giles describes the gem as &quot;the vampire
equivalent of the Holy Grail&quot;, but he also explains that it doesn't actually
exist. While Buffy heads back inside to find Parker, Anya visits Xander once
again, this time in the basement of his house. When Xander reaches into the
fridge to offer her a drink, Anya drops her dress to the floor while his back
is turned. Paralyzed by what he sees after turning back around, Xander can
only listen as Anya describes her plan to get him out of her mind once and for
all: to have sexual intercourse with him. Xander tries to resist, but he soon
crumbles and gives in to Anya's demands. Back at the party, Parker talks to
Buffy about his beliefs on fate. Going with her instincts, Buffy passionately
kisses Parker, then follows him back to his room for the night.<P>

Buffy wakes up the next morning to find that she's alone in Parker's bed. As
she tries to gather all of her clothes, Parker walks in with a few cups of
coffee. Before Buffy leaves, Parker promises to give her a call later in the
day. Buffy returns to her room, only to find Giles at the computer with
Willow. Giles brings Buffy up-to-speed on his research concerning the Gem of
Amara. From what he's learned, the gem may not only be real, but it could also
be located in Sunnydale. After Giles leaves, Willow demands details about
Buffy's night with Parker. At the Harris residence, Anya tells Xander that
she's finally over him. When Xander mutters a simple &quot;okay&quot;, Anya gets upset
and leaves. Meanwhile, Harmony wakes up Spike by writing a love note on his
back. In the tunnel, Spike and his vampire cohorts realize that they're close
to the crypt they're looking for. As hours, then days, go by, Buffy constantly
checks her answering machine, never getting a single message from Parker,
while Spike finally drills through the ground of the crypt.<P>

Inside the crypt, Spike approaches a beautiful necklace with a shining emerald
in the middle of the room. While he puts it on, Harmony tries on various rings
and tiaras. Spike reaches for a nearby cross, believing that the Gem of Amara
has rendered him invincible to all vampire weaknesses. However, a burning pain
accompanies Spike's handling of the cross. Fed up with Harmony's constant
rambling, Spike tries to dust her with a make-shift stake. However, the hole
in her chest quickly reseals. Spike immediately identifies the Gem of Amara on
the ring that Harmony put on. He takes it from her and heads up to the
surface, where the sun is still shining. While walking around campus, Buffy
finds Parker telling the story of his deceased father to another pretty girl.
Pulling him aside, Buffy tries to find out what's been going on. Parker
informs Buffy that she mistook a little fun for a serious commitment. Crushed
and dejected, Buffy watches Parker as he walks off. A familiar voice gets
Buffy's attention, and she turns just in time to see Spike's fist. While they
fight, Giles and the others follow a lead from a news report to the tunnels
beneath Sunnydale, while Xander goes to Stevenson Hall to find Buffy. There,
he runs into Anya, who he quickly brushes off due to current circumstances
regarding Buffy's whereabouts.<P>

Underground, Giles, Willow, and Oz question a distraught Harmony, but she
flees before divulging Spike's location. Back above ground, Spike assaults
Buffy both physically and verbally, ridiculing her failed relationship with
Parker by likening it to the aftermath of her passionate night with Angel.
Xander finds them and tries to help out, but Spike handles him effortlessly by
throwing him into a nearby post. Buffy finally gains the upper hand and
removes the Gem of Amara, causing Spike to suddenly retreat from the burning
rays of sunlight.<P>

Back at Giles' apartment, Buffy announces her decision to give the Gem of
Amara to Angel. With a planned gig in Los Angeles, Oz agrees to take the ring
with him. Later that night, Buffy tries to figure out with Willow what went
wrong between Parker and herself. Deciding she needs some time alone, Buffy
lets Willow go an ahead to the dorm room. Buffy silently walks down the
sidewalks of UC-Sunnydale, confused and dejected.<P>

Unbeknownst to Buffy, Anya and Harmony are doing the exact same thing. As the
moon illuminates the otherwise dark campus, the lonely trio continues along,
their paths never crossing.<P>

Episode Synopsis by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B>
<P>
You can often tell a lot about where an episode of 'Buffy's priorities lie, and where the padding has been added, by dissecting its structure.
<P>
In this episode, for example, there's a pivotal scene almost exactly half way through, when Buffy sleeps with Parker. The first half of the episode leads up to the scene, and the rest deals with the fallout.
<P>
Spike's return is a welcome development. If the revelation itself is disappointingly understated, his beautifully written and performed scenes with Harmony more than live up to expectations.
<P>
If you were to remove this week's McGuffin (the gem of Amara) and the resultant daylight fracas between Spike and Buffy, you'll find a nicely-studied examination of the relationships developing between three odd couples:
<P>
Anya and Xander, Parker and Buffy, and Spike and Harmony. The fling between Parker and Buffy is a sharp contrast to her relationship with Angel, so who could blame viewers for unfavourably comparing the new with the old...?
<P>
<B>Trivia</B>
<P>
Pop culture: Harmony asks: &quot;Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?&quot; Well, he was in the 1994 film adaptation of Anne Rice's 'Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles', which also starred Tom Cruise. In the film Banderas played Armand, a 400 year-old vampire who runs a theatre, where the vampire killings are passed off as stage illusions.
<P>
The album that Oz holds up when he says &quot;More important than this one?&quot; is the last Velvet Underground album to actively feature Lou Reed, 1970's 'Loaded'.
<P>
Continuity: There are plenty of notable continuity references. Harmony and Buffy chat about the &quot;big snake&quot; that threatened to spoil 'Graduation Day Part II'. It was during the melee at the end of this episode that Harmony was bitten and turned into a vampire.
<P>
Anya and Xander began dating in 'The Prom', and the last time he saw her (&quot;fleeing in terror&quot;) was in 'Graduation Day - Part I'. The scar on Buffy's neck - now you see it, now you don't - was the result of Angel's feeding, in 'Graduation Day - Part II'. When Buffy tells Parker that she nearly drowned, she's referring back to 'Prophecy Girl'.
