<B>Graudation Day - Part One</B>
<BR>3ABB21<P>
<HR>
<P>
Graduation Day has finally arrived, and everybody has a different perspective
on it. Cordelia's concerned about the color of their graduation gowns, Buffy doesn't
quite get the whole graduation deal, and Xander, who woke up with a bad
feeling in his gut, fears he won't survive Graduation Day. He's found out that
Mayor Wilkins will be their commencement speaker. Faith isn't concerned about graduation, but she does have an interest in
college. She pays a visit to Professor Worth, a professor at the college. The
Mayor wants him dead, and Faith handles the job.<P>

While enduring his final classes, Xander mentions the Ascension to classmate
Anya, and her ears perk up. She knows about it, and Xander brings her to the
library, where Buffy, Giles and Wesley are trying to figure out why the Mayor
killed Professor Worth. Xander announces to them that Anya not only knows
something about the Ascension... she's the only living person who's been to
one.<P>

She tells them that about 800 years ago, in the Koskov Valleys above the
Urals, there was a sorcerer there who achieved Ascension. He became the
embodiment of the demon Lohesh, and she was there to witness it. Lohesh, a
four-winged soul killer, decimated the village within hours; only a small
handful of people survived. Anya explains that an Ascension means that a human
being becomes pure demon. She tells them that all the demons that walk the
earth are tainted, or human hybrids like vampires, but that a pure demon is
different. She doesn't think this sounds like Lohesh, though, because the
rituals are all different. Just as she says this, the Mayor bursts into the
library.<P>

The Mayor begins to talk about how powerful he'll be once the Ascension
happens. Buffy makes a remark, and the Mayor responds by saying when the
Ascension comes, he'll eat her. Giles, incensed by this, stabs the Mayor with
his fencing foil. Of course, this doesn't affect the Mayor, who merely pulls
the blade from his chest and walks away, grinning about his commencement
address.<P>

With the graduation ceremonies fast approaching, everyone's getting nervous.
Anya, who has seen what an Ascension is like, plans to skip town, though
Xander tries to get her to stay and help. She proposes to him that he could
leave with her, and tries to persuade him to come, but he's committed to
staying to help his friends, and declines. Buffy is also anxious, and tries to
convince her mom to leave town, saying she won't be able to concentrate on
stopping the Mayor if she has to worry about her mom. She doesn't want to
leave, but Buffy finally convinces her. Willow, who is researching in the
hopes of finding a spell to stop the Ascension, is nervous, too. To help her
relax some, Oz plants a passionate kiss on her. Soon they are making love. As
they lie together afterwards, they both agree that everything feels different
now.<P>

At Professor Worth's apartment, Buffy is investigating, trying to find some
information that may be helpful, and Angel comes to help her out. They gather
a box of documents, and prepare to take it to Giles. Outside the professor's
apartment, Buffy and Angel talk about their relationship, and Buffy expresses
her frustration. Suddenly an arrow pierces Angel through the back. We see that
Faith has shot the arrow. When Buffy tries to help Angel up, he collapses;
he's sweating, burning up. The arrow is poisoned, he tells her. In a panic,
Buffy rushes Angel back to the library.<P>

At the library, Giles and Wesley are discussing why the professor's research
was of interest to the Mayor. He was doing research in old lava beds near a
dormant volcano, and he found a large carcass buried underneath by an
eruption. In his paper, Professor Worth suggests that the carcass may be some
heretofore-undiscovered dinosaur. Giles thinks that perhaps it could also be a
demon, which would explain why the Mayor would want to keep this kind of
information secret - if the carcass was a demon, then it means that the demon
can be killed, which would mean that the mayor is only impervious to harm
until the Ascension. Once he's in demon form, he could be killed.<P>

Buffy brings Angel back to the library for help tended. Willow is summoned to
figure out what was on the arrow Faith shot Angel with. Wesley contacts the
Council to see if they can help, but he returns to tell Buffy that they said
they wouldn't help - it's not Council policy to cure vampires. Buffy is
defiant, but Wesley explains that they're talking about laws that are older
than civilization. Buffy says she doesn't care how old the laws are, she's
talking about watching her lover die. The Council's orders, Wesley reminds
her, are to concentrate on the Ascension. Buffy says she doesn't think she's
going to be taking any more orders, from Wesley or the Council, and tells
Wesley that she's not working for them anymore. Wesley pleads with her,
arguing that Faith poisoned Angel to distract Buffy, and now the strategy is
working. Buffy replies that she has a strategy of her own, and Wesley is not
in it. This is mutiny, Wesley cries. Buffy says she likes to think of it as
her graduation.<P>

Willow, meanwhile, has figured out what the poison is - its Latin name
translates to &quot;killer of the dead.&quot; Oz finds that the only cure for it is to
drain the blood of a slayer. Buffy has an idea: she'll get Faith's blood, and
she'll kill her first if she has to. No more playing around, she says, she's
ready to take on Faith to the death. Opening the closet in the library, she
removes a dagger - the one the Mayor gave Faith, the one Faith used to kill
one of the creatures from the Box of Gavroc in the cafeteria when the box was
exchanged for Willow - and takes it with her. Oz and Willow figure out where
Faith's apartment is, and Buffy heads there for the confrontation.<P>

The Mayor, meanwhile, is busy preparing for the Ascension by performing the
Ritual of Gavroc. Sitting at his desk in his office, he gleefully devours the
creatures from the Box of Gavroc, feeling stronger with each one he eats.<P>

Buffy arrives at Faith's apartment, and the battle soon begins. The furious
fight leads them crashing through the window of Faith's apartment and onto a
lower roof below. When they land, Buffy slaps handcuffs onto Faith's wrist,
and the other cuff is already attached to her own wrist. The fight continues
between the two handcuffed slayers until Faith breaks the cuffs apart. Buffy
staggers back, and pulls out Faith's dagger. They tangle some more, and the
fight moves toward the edge of the roof. As they peer over the ledge, Buffy
stabs Faith. Faith, stumbling, steps on to the ledge, leans back and says
goodbye, falling back into a passing truck. Buffy rushes to the ledge, but
she's too late. The truck, with Faith, and her slayer's blood which Buffy
needs to save Angel, is driving away... <A HREF="GDAY2.html">[to be continued...]</A><P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

There are definite indications that fatigue is closing in as the series reaches its finale. A strange mood shrouds the first two thirds of the episode: the performances are unusually stilted; the dialogue is peppered with woefully poor lines, and all the show's rhythms seem adrift. (I disagree. The episodes aren't shot one-by-one anyway - Ed). If this was an effort to create an ominous tone, in order to build tension, it isn't terribly successful. It takes an inordinate amount of time before the gears click into place: the pace only begins to pick up as the climactic showdown between Buffy and Faith begins.
<P>
Although the individual pieces never quite seem to fit together, 'Graduation Day - Part 1' provides some very memorable scenes to relish: Faith's chilling cold-blooded murder of Professor Worth is an event that would have been almost inconceivable a few episodes ago; "evil girl" Anya's romantic scene with Xander ("When I think that something could happen to you it feels bad inside, like I might vomit") is very funny, and demonstrates the character's potential.
<P>
There's a commendable atmosphere of genuine menace during the scene where the mayor ("call me Richard") visits the library. The funniest moment in the episode, though, is the scene in the library, when Giles and Xander unfold the illustration of Olvikan.
<P>
'Graduation Day - Part 1' seems half-hearted. For all its hints of what the Ascension might entail, we know that it's eventually going to be something that the show is going to have to achieve with a TV-show size budget.
<P>
The episode ends on a note that demonstrates the lack of energy present: Buffy knows that she needs the blood of a Slayer to cure Angel. She's tracked Faith down, has mortally wounded her in a bruising confrontation, and yet she watches, apparently helpless, as Faith quietly escapes on the back of a lorry...
<P>
<B>Trivia</B>
<P>
Pop culture: Xander's line in the library, as he sees the foldout illustration of the demon Olvikan, "We're going to need a bigger boat" misquotes Steven Spielberg's terrific 1975 movie 'Jaws'. The line is one of the most famous quotes in cinema history. The line is delivered by police chief Brody (Roy Schneider), just after has caught his first glimpse of a great white shark that's been terrorizing a small coastal town: "You're going to need a bigger boat!"
<P>
Willow's vain hope that Siegfried and Roy might be the speakers at the graduation ceremony is a reference to a pair of flamboyant magicians who perform in a spectacular Las Vegas show. They are famous for their elaborate costumes, and their menagerie of big cats, including white tigers.
