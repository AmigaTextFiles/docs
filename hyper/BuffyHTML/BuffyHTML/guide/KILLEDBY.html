<P><B>Killed By Death</B>
<BR>5V18<P>
<HR>
<P>
The flu has been spreading around Sunnydale High, and Buffy's one of the
unlucky souls who's got it. While on a routine patrol through the cemetery,
Buffy runs into Xander, Willow, and Cordelia. Before she can get them to go
home, Angel appears and attacks Cordy. Buffy fends him off, but the flu has
made her too weak to fight him effectively. Angel nearly bites Buffy when the
others come to her aid and thwart him back with their crosses. After Angel
leaves, Buffy collapses and lies on the ground, unconscious.<P>

The gang brings Buffy to the emergency room of Sunnydale General. Giles and
Joyce soon arrive, and they wait for Buffy to be moved to another room so they
could see her. On the way to room, Buffy realizes that she's going to be there
awhile, so she tries to get out, screaming that she has to kill the vampires.
Dr. Wilkinson injects a tranquilizer to calm her down. Soon, Buffy is asleep
in her new room while the others wait outside in the hall. Joyce tells
everyone that Buffy has been afraid of hospitals ever since she saw her cousin
Celia die in a hospital when they were both very young. The group goes home
while Xander stays behind to protect Buffy in case Angel shows up. That night,
Buffy is still overcome with her fever when she notices a young boy standing
in her doorway. As the boy walks away, Buffy sees a tall, demonic man
following the boy. He is dressed in black clothes and a black hat, and his
fingers are long and pointed. Buffy gets out of her bed to follow them, but
she soon finds herself in a flashback to a time when she was much younger,
walking down a similar hospital hallway. As her young self walks into a room
and approaches the bed curtains, Buffy wakes up, realizing that she was just
dreaming.<P>

She then gets out of bed and walks down the hall. She stops outside of a door
from which a body of a recently diseased girl is being wheeled out of. Buffy
eavesdrops on Dr. Wilkinson talking with another doctor, Dr. Stanley Backer.
Dr. Wilkinson is arguing about some kind of experimental procedure that Dr.
Backer has been performing on the children. Buffy then notices two children
standing before her. One of them is the same boy she saw earlier, who tells
her that Death is coming for them, and that he can't be seen by grownups.
Elsewhere, Angel walks into the hospital, holding some flowers for Buffy.
Xander blocks his path and challenges him to a fight, but Angel simply points
out Xander's apparent jealousy of Angel for getting to Buffy first. Angel then
turns around and leaves.<P>

The next morning, Buffy's fever has gone down, and the gang pays her a visit.
Buffy tells them about the apparent demon she saw walking the halls, the one
that grownups can't see, but also notes that she may have just been delusional
from her fever. She also tells them about the girl who died and Dr. Backer's
experiments. Giles and Willow return to the library to do some research while
Xander and Cordy snoop around the hospital for more info. They find nothing,
so Xander decides to stay behind and watch after Buffy. Cordy is upset with
him for his obvious attraction that he still holds for Buffy, but she later
returns with donuts and coffee to keep Xander company. In the meantime, Giles
and Willow concoct a theory that the kids think they're seeing Death, but
they're really seeing Dr. Backer. Willow researches his background, but can't
find much to convict him of anything.<P>

Later that night, Buffy sneaks out of her room again. She heads for the
children's ward, where Dr. Backer is preparing to inject a sleeping girl with
an unknown solution. He then hears something, but it is too late, for an
invisible force attacks the doctor, slashing away at his body. The young boy,
Ryan, wakes up and watches in horror as Dr. Backer is slashed to death by the
demon. Buffy looks in and sees Dr. Backer being attacked, but she can't see
the attacker. His lifeless body is then thrown out of the room, and before
Buffy can reach it, she is knocked back by the unseen force. She lies against
the wall, unconscious, while Dr. Backer's body is dragged down the hall and
out of sight.<P>

The next morning, Buffy tells the gang that Backer is no longer their suspect,
then shows them a drawing that Ryan made of the demon. Joyce arrives and tells
Buffy that she's been cleared to go home, but Buffy makes up an excuse that
she's still not feeling well so she can stay in the hospital and fight the
demon. Willow stays to help Buffy investigate Dr. Backer's office for clues as
to why he was killed, while Xander elects to stand guard at the hospital. This
leaves Giles to reluctantly work with Cordy in the library. In Dr. Backer's
office, Willow finds a log proving that Backer was innoculating the kids with
the same virus they were infected with in an attempt to raise their
temperature and burn out their fever. According the log, the process was
starting to work, so Backer really was helping the children all along. At the
library, Cordy notices that a picture on the cover of a book resembles the
picture that Ryan drew. She calls Buffy and tells them that the name of the
demon is Der Kindestod. Giles then tells Buffy that Kindestod kills its
victims by sitting on top of them and pinning them on their backs. It then
sucks the life out of them somehow.<P>

Buffy suddenly has another flashback to her earlier years. The younger Buffy
walks into the room and opens the curtains, only to see Celia screaming with
her hands in front of her, as if she is trying to push some invisible object
off of her. Buffy realizes that her cousin Celia was killed by Kindestod.
After hanging up the phone, Buffy realizes that the only time she was able to
see the Kindestod was when she was still under the effects of her fever.
Willow and Buffy sneak into Backer's office again. Buffy opens the
refrigerator and removes a test tube that contains the same virus strain that
Backer was using in his experiments. Willow dilutes it with water before Buffy
drinks it. Sick again, Buffy stumbles to the children's ward with Willow's
help. However, all the children are no longer in their room. Buffy then sees
Kindestod walking around inside the room, then entering a door labelled
&quot;Basement Access&quot;. The door is locked, so Buffy needs to find another way to
the basement. Dr. Wilkinson walks into the hallway and tries to get Buffy back
to her room, but Buffy pushes her away, and she and Willow run for it. Two
security guards stop them, but Willow throws an imaginary fit to divert the
guards while Buffy slips by. She finds Xander, and the two of them head down
to the basement. They find Ryan pinned to the floor by Kindestod, while the
rest of the children sit together screaming. Buffy fights Kindestod while
Xander moves the others to safety. Before Kindestod can drain Buffy of her
life force, she grabs his head with both hands and snaps his neck, killing him
instantly.<P>

The next morning, Buffy is back in the comfort of her own bedroom. Xander and
Willow are also there, keeping her company while she recovers from her fever
again. Joyce brings Buffy a letter that just arrived in the mail. It's from
Ryan, and Buffy opens it to find a drawing of Buffy standing victoriously over
the body of Kindestod, it's neck cracked open and blood spurting out.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

'Killed by Death' is a very disappointing episode that blatantly &quot;borrows&quot;
from Wes Craven's 1984 horror classic 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' for its
ideas, and even some of its imagery. Moving Buffy into the hospital diminishes
the group dynamic that energises most episodes, and seems to merely be an
excuse to use young children as the prey of a supernatural serial killer.<P>

Genuine highlights are few and far between, but pairing up Giles and Cordelia
provides much-needed humour in an otherwise gloomy episode (&quot;Boy, there's a
demon for everything!&quot;), and the tension between Xander and Angel when they
meet at the hospital is rather satisfying (&quot;It must just eat you up that I got
there first&quot;).<P>

Rob Des Hotel and Dean Batali's script is littered with idiotic contrivances,
and obvious plot holes. There are signs that this episode had a troubled
production. Established character actor Richard Herd (the alien leader in 'V')
has a throwaway role, and barely any dialogue, as Doctor Stanley Backer;
Buffy's fight with the Kindestod is poorly directed, and needed a couple of
clumsily-added lines of dialogue to explain what happened; and the last scene
seems so superfluous it draws undue attention to itself. It's all a bit of a
mess really.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

Willow feigns fear of frogs to distract the guards and Doctor Wilkinson, a
phobia she first mentioned in <A href=WHATSMYLINE1.html>What's My Line? - Part One</A>. In the original
script it was &quot;bats&quot; that were climbing all over here.<P>

Pop culture: when discussing Death, Xander says &quot;If he asks you to play chess,
don't even do it, guy's like a whiz!&quot; This is a reference to Ingmar Bergman's
wonderful 1957 film 'The Seventh Seal', in which a Knight returning from the
Crusades encounters Death, and stalls the Reaper by offering to play chess
with him. (If he wins, Death will spare his life. If he loses, Death can take
him without a struggle). The scene is iconic, and was mercilessly parodied in
the 1991 movie 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey' (amongst others).<P>
