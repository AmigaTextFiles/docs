<HR>
<P>

Here's a list of nasty, evil creatures who've received, or are waiting to receive, execution by our favourite Slayer!<P>

<B>Balthazar</B> The head of a 15th Century duelists cult called El Eliminati, Balthazar
is a powerful demon with the power to bring people to him by simply gesturing with his arms.
This grotesquely obese enemy festers in a vat of liquid elixir that his acolytes must
ladle over his torso. He came to Sunnydale seeking an amulet that would restore him to
his devastatingly full power. He also hints at the mayor's ascension in his dying seconds,
proclaiming that "When he rises, you'll wish I'd killed you all."
Appears in <A href=BADGIRLS.html>Bad Girls</A>.<P>

<B>Bezoar</B> A giant prehistoric creature that lives under the school, Bezoar
disperses its offspring as eggs to take over the student body. The slimy,
tarantula-like creatures hatch and attach themselves parasitically to the
student's spines, then force their unwitting victims to mine the school
basement for more eggs. Appears in <A href=BADEGGS.html>Bad Eggs</A>.<P>

<B>Chumash Indians</B> When Xander fell into an ancient tomb, he stirred the avenging
spirits of the Chumash Indians. The Europeans inflicted such brutish
atrocities on the peaceful tribe that they swore revenge on Anglo's in
general. Their spirits were fittingly unleashed on Thanksgiving Day and
instinctively sought the most prominent warrior in the land: Buffy.
Brandishing their original weapons, they laid siege to Giles' house and
fiercely battled Buffy and her crew. Appear in <A href=PANGS.html>Pangs</A>.<P>

<B>Coach Marin and the Swim Team</B> In striving for a championship swim team, coach
Carl Marin gives his boys fish DNA under the guise of steroids. They
unexpectedly become bloodthirsty fish creatures after tearing out of their own
flesh, and to keep them in shape, Coach Marin feeds them members of the
faculty and tries to give them Buffy as a &quot;pet.&quot; Appear in <A href=GOFISH.html>Go Fish</A>.<P>

<B>Ethan Rayne</B> One of Giles' old demon summoning buddies and the cause of the
original Halloween misadventures, the cowardly Ethan lends his talents to
members of the undead like Mr. Trick and Lurcoonis. Buffy doesn't have the
heart to kill him, but he wouldn't hesitate to offer Buffy or her friends'
lives to save his own. Appears in <A href=HALLOWEEN.html>Halloween</A>, <A href=THEDARKAGE.html>The Dark Age</A>, and <A href=BANDCANDY.html>Band Candy</A>.<P>

<B>Frawley</B> Another member of Mr. Trick's notorious &quot;Slayerfest '98&quot; team, Frawley
is a human hunter straight out of one of Davey Crockett's nightmares. He shows
up equipped with a long range rifle and a set of bear traps.<P>

<B>Frederick and Hans</B> Part of the team assembled by Mr. Trick to assassinate
Buffy and Faith in &quot;Slayerfest '98,&quot; these German twins are ex-SWAT Team
members with an extensive criminal record. Their arsenal includes a vast array
of state-of-the-art tracking instruments and firearms. Appear in <A href=HOMECOMING.html>Homecoming</A>.<P>

<B>Gachnar</B> When a fraternity house unknowingly drew the Mark of Gachnar on the
floor for their Halloween party, it summoned this Demon of Fear. The house was
taken over by everyone's worst fears, leaving the partygoers cowering in
shock, and Xander, Willow, Oz and Buffy to stop it. When the demon finally
surfaced, its intimidating appearance was wasted on its miniature body that
couldn't have beat up Brainy Smurf. Appears in <A href=FEARITSELF.html>Fear, Itself</A>.<P>

<B>Gentlemen</B> The Gentlemen are an order of sadistic surgeons who travel from town
to town collecting human hearts. Needing seven hearts to survive, but starting
with only two, they hover ominously over the ground and search for &quot;heart
donors&quot; with their demented lackeys. The Gentlemen performed a ritual that
robbed the entire town of Sunnydale of their voices so that no one could
scream when they removed the hearts of their unwitting victims. The only thing
that can destroy them is the sound of a human voice. Appear in <A href=HUSH.html>Hush</A>.<P>

<B>Gwendolyn Post</B> Ms. Post was a Watcher kicked out by The Council for misuse of
dark power. She befriended Buffy and the gang by posing as Faith's new
Watcher, but she was really after the Glove of Myhnegon, which grants its
wearer evil powers of destruction. Appears in <A href=REVELATIONS.html>Revelations</A>.<P>

<B>Hans and Greta</B> Beginning their evil excursions in 1649, Hans and Greta
resurface every 50 years to wreak havoc on small towns by brainwashing the
townspeople into killing the innocent in a witchhunt. By staging their own
ritualistic deaths in Sunnydale, Hans and Greta coaxed the parents of
Sunnydale into burning Buffy, Willow and Amy at the stake, but quick thinking
on Buffy's part revealed Hans and Greta's true demonic form. Appear in
<A href=GINGERBREAD.html>Gingerbread</A>.<P>

<B>Harmony Kendall</B> Harmony was one of Cordelia's superficial friends from
Sunnydale High who fought valiantly in the Graduation Day Battle. However, no
one saw her get bit and turn into a vampire during the melee. Wishing to kill
the people she merely teased in high school, she entered an abusive
relationship with Spike who promised to help her dispose of her ex-classmates.
She helped the elusive Spike find the Gem of Amara, granting him the power to
expose himself to sunlight. Appears in <A href="HARSHLIGHT.html">Harsh Light of Day</A>.<P>

<B>Hellmouth Demon</B> In one of Buffy's more difficult battles, an Apocalypse Cult
called the Sisterhood of Jhe attempted to open the Hellmouth, producing a
four-headed, dragon-like demon in the library who's purpose was to begin the
process of sucking the Earth down to Hell. Fortunately, Buffy, Giles and
Willow were able to defeat the Hellmouth Demon before it could bring the end
of the world. Appears in <A href=THEZEPPO.html>The Zeppo</A>.<P>

<B>Jack the Barkeep</B> When Xander began barkeeping at the UC Sunnydale pub, he had
no idea that he was serving the students contaminated beer. The salty barkeep,
Jack, was so fed up with cocky youngsters ruining the culture of beer drinking
that he put an elixir in the Black Frost Ale. The recipe, given to Jack by his
Warlock brother-in-law, turned the overly intellectual students into brutish
primates. Appears in <A href=BEERBAD.html>Beer Bad</A>.<P>

<B>Jack O' Toole Gang</B> Jack O' Toole, the town psychopath and self-made zombie,
reanimated his dead buddies for one last night of rowdiness, and attempted to
blow up the school, only to be thwarted by a lone and frightened Xander.
Appears in <A href=THEZEPPO.html>The Zeppo</A>.<P>

<B>James Stanley</B> In 1955 a Sunnydale High student named James Stanley killed his
teacher, Miss Newman, with whom he was in love. Their spirits return to the
present to possess unwitting students and replay the violent shooting over and
over again. Appears in <A href=EYES4U.html>I Only Have Eyes For You</A>.<P>

<B>Kakistos</B> When Faith arrived in Sunnydale, she brought a revenge-seeking
vampire hot on her heels. So old that his hands are cloven hooves, Kakistos
enjoys performing torturous atrocities on his victims. Appears in
<A href=FAITHHOPETRICK.html>Faith, Hope and Trick</A>.<P>

<B>Kathy</B> Trouble seems to find Buffy. Even her first college roommate turned out
to be a member of a clan of interdimensional demons seeking existence in our
reality. The mischievous Kathy snuck into our dimension to go to college with
other mortals, but the leader of her clan, Tapparich, came searching for her.
Kathy attempted to perform the Mok'tagar ritual on Buffy, involving the forced
ingestion of animal blood during sleep. She then tried to suck the Slayer's
soul out of her mouth so Taparrich would take Buffy back instead of her.
Appears in <A href=LIVINGCOND.html>Living Conditions</A>.<P>

<B>Ken</B> The lord of a Hell-like underworld in an alternate dimension, Ken poses as
the head of a youth outreach program that kidnaps troubled, but able bodied
teens. He and his demonic minions force them to slave in the murky caverns of
their dimension until they grow old. Appears in <A href=ANNE.html>Anne</A>.<P>

<B>Kulak</B> When Mr. Trick assembled an elite crew of bounty hunters to kill Buffy
and Faith in &quot;Slayerfest '98,&quot; Kulak was by far the most intimidating. A
deadly member of the Weequay clan, he wields razor sharp throwing blades,
which he stores in his forearms. Appears in <A href=HOMECOMING.html>Homecoming</A>.<P>

<B>Lagos</B> A medieval demon, Lagos visited Sunnydale in search of the Glove of
Myhnegon, which grants its wearer evil powers of destruction. Buffy employed
the aid of Willow to fight Lagos in a cemetery showdown. Appears in
<A href=REVELATIONS.html>Revelations</A>.<P>

<B>Lunch Lady</B> When Buffy gained the power of telepathy from a demon she slayed,
she overheared someone in the cafeteria plan to massacre the students the next
day. Suspected by Xander, but ignored by others, the lunchlady was discovered
pouring rat poison into the jello. Buffy defeated her, even though she wielded
a meat cleaver. Appears in <A href=EARSHOT.html>Earshot</A>.<P>

<B>Lurconis</B> A giant snake-demon that lives in the sewers, Lurconis requires
ritualistic offers of babies for him to eat. Mr. Trick distributed cursed
candy to distract the adults of Sunnydale so that an army of vampires could
steal the town's infants for the sacrifice. Buffy scorched him with an ignited
gas line, but Lurconis still lurks somewhere beneath the streets of Sunnydale.
Featured in <A href=BANDCANDY.html>Band Candy</A>.<P>

<B>Lyle and Tector</B> These violent brothers used to be outlaws in the 1800's who
wiped out an entire Mexican village in 1886, before they became an even more
ruthless pair of outlaw vampires. They visited Sunnydale on a quest to kill
Buffy and pick up a few &quot;snacks&quot; in the meantime. Appear in <A href=BADEGGS.html>Bad Eggs</A>.<P>

<B>Mouthless Demon</B> When Buffy killed one of these mouthless demons, she
inadvertently absorbed some of their fluorescent blood, she gained their power
of telepathy. In order to cure her of this curse, Angel brought her a
concoction containing the heart of one of the demons, which returned her
senses to normal. Featured in <A href=EARSHOT.html>Earshot</A>. <P>

<B>Ovu Mobani (Pat)</B> When Joyce Summers purchased an ancient Nigerian mask, she
had no idea that it housed the zombie demon Ovu Mobani. The mask has the power
to awaken the dead who wreak havoc on Sunnydale, and turn its wearer (Joyce's
zombified friend Pat) into the demon incarnate. The only way to destroy it is
to puncture its glowing, red eyes. Appears in <A href=DEADMANSPARTY.html>Dead Man's Party</A>.<P>

<B>Pete</B> After overdosing on a potion he created to increase his testosterone
level, Pete transforms into a marauding monster whenever he gets angry. With
veins bulging, his victims are guys who he thinks are after his girlfriend,
Debbie, and anyone who tries to get in his way. Appears in
<A href=BEAUTYANDBEASTS.html>Beauty And The Beasts</A>.<P>

<B>Polgara Demon</B> These vermin-headed demons became the desire of Ms. Walsh. Their
defense mechanism is a sharp, spear-like bone that protrudes from their hand
during battle. Ms. Walsh deployed the Initiative to capture one with its arm
intact so she could use it on her twisted creation, Adam. Featured in
<A href=IINTEAM.html>The I in Team</A>.<P>

<B>Sunday</B> Sunday was the head of a gang of misfit vampires that hole up in the
abandoned Psi Theta fraternity house, preying on unwitting freshmen. They then
stole their belongings to furnish their own lair. Sunday was one of the few
vampires actually able to defeat Buffy in their first encounter, nearly
breaking the Slayer's arm. Appears in <A href=THEFRESHMAN.html>The Freshman</A>.<P>

<B>Vahrall demon</B> These talon covered demons came seconds away from opening the
hellmouth under the Sunnydale High library. They performed an ancient ritual
involving the Word of Valios, the bones of a child and the sacrifice of
themselves. Fortunately both Buffy and Riley were there to intervene with
their attempt to unleash hell on Earth. Featured in <A href=DOOMED.html>Doomed</A>.<P>

<B>Veruca</B> The lead singer of the band Shy, Veruca was a charismatic and sexy
young performer who instantly drew the attention of Oz. She turned out to be
an intense advanced werewolf. She drew upon Oz's animal desires and tried to
lure Oz into accepting the brutal nature of his werewolf side. When it was
apparent that Oz wasn't seeing things her way, she went after Willow, but Oz
ripped through her jugular before she could do any harm. The experience was so
profound that Oz left Sunnydale and Willow to spend some time on his own to
find himself. Appears in <A href=WILDATHEART.html>Wild at Heart</A>.<P>

<B>Zacaray Kralik</B> On her 18th birthday, Buffy was forced to perform the
Cruciamentum test, in which she had to fight a vampire foe without her Slayer
powers. The Watcher's council chose Zack, an insane vampire who was committed
to an asylum for torturing and murdering over a dozen women when he was alive,
and he proved to be a little to powerful for their game. Appears in <A href=HELPLESS.html>Helpless</A>.<P>

<B>Mayor Richard Wilkins III</B><P>

No enemy has threatened Buffy's life more times than the conspiring Mayor of
Sunnydale. He's a demon over a hundred years old who's been in Sunnydale since
it was erected on the hellmouth. With his seat as the patriarch of the town,
he turned it into a buffet for demons by giving the townspeople a false sense
of security and covering up murders. Part of what allowed this demon to fool a
town into electing him Mayor is the charm exposed through his deep rooted
psychosis. While plotting to slaughter the inhabitants of Sunnydale, he
actually comes off as a kindhearted individual, his desk never lacking a bowl
of cookies or candy for visitors. He's neurotically obsessive-compulsive,
insisting that his employees wash their hands constantly and keep their feet
off the desk. <P>

Never one to do his own dirty work, the cunning Mayor employed Mr. Trick to
actualize his ploys to assassinate Buffy. After Mr. Trick was slain, he
convinced Faith to work at his side, promising her power when the world would
finally become a playground for the undead. The demented Mayor got so attached
to her that he became her surrogate father and she became his only weakness.
Mayor Wilkins organized numerous assaults on Sunnydale, including the
deployment of his vampires to steal babies for the feeding of the demon
Lurconis. He also had Buffy arrested and charged with the murder of Kendra.
However, all his devious acts have been part of his master plan to ascend into
pure demonhood. First, Mayor Wilkins performed a ritual granting him
invincibility, making his tissue regenerate almost immediately after any
laceration. He then acquired the Books of Ascension which map out the final
ritual for his ultimate departure from mortality. <P>

At the time, Anya was the only one to have witnessed an Ascension. She
revealed that the demons Buffy had been fighting have all been tainted
hybrids. An Ascension incarnates a pure demon capable of mass destruction. 800
years ago, Anya was present when a sorcerer in the Coscov Valleys achieved
Ascension into the demon Loesh. It decimated an entire village in minutes and
was only stopped by the fury of a volcano. Following the detailed steps
proscribed in the Books of Ascension, Wilkins consumed the deadly footlong
spiders teeming inside the Box of Gavroc. On Sunnydale High's graduation day,
his Ascension was finally realized. Under eclipsed skies, he metamorphisized
into an immense dragon-like demon, towering over the high school. After eating
principal Snyder, it took a full-fledged battalion of students under the
command of Xander to fight it with flame-throwers and medieval weaponry. He
was finally destroyed by a fertilizer bomb that decimated the entire school.
Features prominently in season 3, on the countdown to the ascension. <P>

<B>Mr. Trick</B> This elusive and sardonic vampire constantly schemed to destroy
Buffy. He arrived in Sunnydale with Kakistos, with whom he began his
unrelenting quest to kill the slayer and take over the town. He worked closely
with the Mayor after his failed Slayerfest '98, and although he usually
employed others to hunt Buffy down, he wasn't afraid to go toe-to-toe with her
himself. First appears in <A href=FAITHHOPETRICK.html>Faith, Hope and Trick</A>.<P>

<B>Ampatta</B> Released when the seal that held her at bay was broken, this
500-year-old Incan mummy wreaks havoc on Sunnydale. Ampatta can only continue
to live if she periodically drains the life out of an unwitting victim with a
deadly kiss. <P>

<B>Drusilla</B>  (Juliet Landau) Drusilla and Spike return to Sunnydale shortly after
the death of The Master to offer their services to The Anointed One. Spike and
Drusilla waste no time in destroying him, and taking his place as the leader
of Sunnydale's vampire community, promising &quot;From now on we're going to have a
little less ritual and a little more fun around here&quot;. After killing her
entire family and visiting every conceivable mental torture on the young
Drusilla, Angel turned her into a demon on the day she took the convent's holy
vows. Completely insane, she rampaged through Europe, slaughtering victims
mercilessly until she was almost killed herself by an angry crowd in Prague.
Spike saved her and has been working to restore her to her full power.
Cunning, deadly and deranged, Drusilla at full strength is a formidable enemy.<P>
<P>

<B>Eyghon</B> An ancient demon who lives by possessing the souls of dead or
unconscious people, Eyghon comes to Sunnydale looking for its next victim. It
seem that Giles is familiar with the demon, as is his friend Ethan. Back in
college, they summoned the demon using an ancient ritual. Ethan and Giles both
bore the mark of Eyghon - a tattoo - on their forearm. Features in
<A href=THEDARKAGE.html>The Dark Age</A>.<P>

<B>Machida</B> In the basement of a long-standing fraternity house in Sunnydale, a
secret lurks. Machida, a huge snake-demon, arises each year and is appeased by
the sacrifice of three young women. The women are lured there by members of
the fraternity, who gain power and rewards from the demon for their evil work.
Appears in <A href=REPTILEBOY.html>Reptile Boy</A>.<P>

<B>Moloch</B> Imprisoned magically in an ancient book, Moloch is a demon fond of
charming his victims into believing he is their friend, using them to do his
bidding, then killing them. When the book was scanned into the Sunnydale High
computer, Moloch escaped onto the internet. Featured in <A href=IROBOTYOU.html>I Robot... You Jane</A>.<P>

<B>Spike</B> (James Marsters) Nicknamed as &quot;Spike&quot; because of his fondness for
torturing his victims with railroad spikes, William the Bloody once hunted
side-by-side with Angel. Since then, Angel has had a change of heart about
killing humans. Spike on the other hand, will kill anyone who gets in his way.
The Anointed One found that out the hard way when Spike became angry and
hoisted him up into the sunlight, burning him to nothing. Two hundred year-old
Spike was formerly known as William the Bloody, and earned his new nickname
from his habit of torturing his victims with railway spikes. He will be a
formidable opponent for Buffy and the gang: he's already killed two Slayers.
Appears in many Buffy episodes.<P>

James Marsters, who has appeared on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; as the
goth-decked vampire Spike for the past two seasons, joins the cast as a series
regular for the show's fourth season. <P>

Born in the remote northern logging town of Greenville, CA, and raised in
Modesto, CA, Marsters always knew he wanted to be an actor. From his debut as
Eyeore in a fourth grade production of &quot;Winnie the Pooh,&quot; he went on to study
acting at New York's prestigious Juilliard. He began his professional career
in the theater, performing in stage productions including &quot;The Tempest&quot; and
&quot;Red Roses&quot; at Chicago's renowned Goodman Theatre. <P>

Marsters made his onscreen debut guest-starring on the television series
&quot;Northern Exposure.&quot; He landed the prominent role of an ill-at-ease priest,
which was cast locally in Seattle, soon after moving to the Pacific Northwest.
He was inspired by the success to move to Los Angeles and within months was
sinking his proverbial teeth into the role of Spike on &quot;Buffy the Vampire
Slayer.&quot; <P>

Marsters made his feature film debut in October 1999 in &quot;The House on Haunted
Hill,&quot; a psychological horror film which also stars Geoffrey rush, Famke
Janssen, Taye Diggs and Lisa Loeb. <P>

When he's not working, Marsters enjoys playing the guitar, watching football
and spending time with friends at the beach. He currently lives in Los
Angeles. <P>

<B>Ted Buchanan</B> (John Ritter) He seemed to be almost perfect: he cooked great
pizza, played a mean game of miniature golf, and was an outstanding salesman
at Loren Computers: &quot;Nobody beats 'The Machine' - the guy's a genius, knows
everything about computers...&quot; It was only when Ted Buchanan started dating
Joyce Summers that alarm bells started ringing. Buffy's suspicions were roused
when he rounded on her at the golf course: &quot;Do you want me to slap that
smart-ass mouth of yours?&quot;. Buffy was concerned when she discovered that -
unbeknownst to Joyce - Ted had marriage plans. When she finally confronted
Ted, he hit her, giving her the opportunity to retaliate. She knocked him down
the stairs. Joyce was stunned: &quot;You killed him!&quot; What neither of them knew was
that Ted was an android. He returned, and attacked Buffy again. Willow, Xander
and Cordelia discovered another secret - Ted's home hid a 1950s apartment,
complete with the corpses of the four women he'd been married to. Buffy
finally dispatched Ted with a frying pan in <A href=TED.html>Ted</A>. A homicidal robot who charms
women into trusting him, then kills them off, Ted was human once. A sickly
genius whose wife left him, Ted created a robot version of himself to bring
his wife back to him.<P>

<B>Teraka</B> A secret society of demonic assassins. Once called upon to eliminate a
target, they will not stop until they have completed their task. Featured in
<A href=WHATSMYLINE1.html>What's My Line - Part One</A>.<P>

<B>The Judge</B> An ancient and indestructable demon warrior, the judge once roamed
the earth, laying waste to human civilization in the name of all that's evil.
Since it was not possible to kill him with normal weapons, the only way to
defeat him was to chop him up and separate the pieces from eachother. As a
birthday gift to Drusilla, Spike orchestrated the Judge's resurrection,
bringing the pieces back together. Once his parts were joined, the Judge was
reanimated. Appears in <A href=SURPRISE.html>Surprise</A>.<P>

<B>The Master</B> (Mark Metcalf) The Master is the oldest and most powerful vampire.
He became trapped in Sunnydale 60 years ago when his plan to open the
Hellmouth - a gateway to unleash demonic forces - was thwarted by an
earthquake. Now Sunnydale High School lies on top of the Hellmouth and has
become the focus of vampire activity. The town has a new arrival, Buffy the
Vampire Slayer, who battles to prevent The Master's escape and his plan to
take over the world. The Master's origins are cloaked in mystery and his power
is unquestionable. He acts through his minions (such as Luke and Darla) and is
ruthless if they fail in their tasks. After defeating Buffy in <A href=PROPHECYGIRL.html>Prophecy Girl</A>
the Hellmouth opened, and The Master enjoyed a moment of freedom. Shortly
afterwards Buffy threw him through a glass roof onto a wooden stake in the
room below, and he crumbled to dust... Trapped in a sort of dimensional
prison, he was unable to enter our world, only able to act through his
minions. With the help of these vampire followers, he was able to cross over
to our world briefly by luring Buffy to his lair and biting her. Fortunately,
Buffy wasn't dead and surprised the Master, impaling him. His minions, led by
the Anointed One, tried to resurrect him using human sacrifice, but were
foiled by Buffy, who then smashed the Master's bones to bits. The Master is
gone forever, or at least for now. <P>

<B>The Pack</B> An ancient spell allows the spirits of animals, in this case hyenas,
to inhabit the bodies of humans. After eating Principal Flutie, they run a
rampage through Sunnydale. Appear in <A href=THEPACK.html>The Pack</A>.
