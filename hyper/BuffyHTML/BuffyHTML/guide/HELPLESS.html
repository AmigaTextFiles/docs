&quot;I don't know you.&quot; - Buffy
<P>
After a training session in the mansion, Buffy and Angel get a little too
close for comfort. With her eighteenth birthday almost upon her, Buffy is
anxiously awaiting to spend some time with her father at an ice show. Later,
at the library, Giles leads Buffy through a study of vibratory stones. Despite
being a little fidgety, Buffy manages to concentrate on one of the stones.
Afterwards, Buffy battles with a vampire in the park. Just as she is about to
deliver the final blow, something surges through Buffy's body, and she
suddenly finds herself powerless. The vampire quickly takes the upper hand,
knocking her to the ground and turning the wooden stake on the Slayer herself.
Buffy panicks, but she is still able to stun the vampire with a headbutt and
push him off of her. She grabs the stake and aims it straight up as the
vampire leaps onto her. In an instant, the vampire is nothing but dust.<P>

Giles enters the library the next morning to find Buffy practicing her aim
with throwing knives. As the random placing of the knives on and around the
target shows, the Slayer is not her usual self. Giles ensures Buffy that she'll be
okay. Outside, Buffy downplays her friends' enthusiasm over the upcoming
birthday, suggesting that a party may not be the greatest of ideas, given her
tainted history with such social gatherings. Later that night, Buffy notices a
birthday balloon floating in her kitchen with what appear to be an envelope
and tickets attached to the string. As Joyce informs her that Hank won't be
able to free up enough time to take her to the ice show, Buffy folds up the
envelope without even opening it.<P>

Meanwhile, three men are hard at work inside an old, abandoned boarding house.
One of the men, Quentin Travers, looks on as his two associates, Blair and
Hobson, work on laying bricks in several of the doorways. At the library,
Buffy tries to indirectly ask Giles to take her to the ice show, but he is
more interested in making her study the vibratory stones. After Buffy finally
gives up her futile effort, Giles instructs her to concentrate on the fault
inside the large blue stone. As Buffy stares at it, she suddenly loses all
touch with the outside world. Giles checks to make sure Buffy's in a trance,
then takes an injection kit out of his bag. He injects a strange, green fluid
into Buffy's arm. After he finishes the task and puts away the kit, Giles
waves his hand in front of the fault, breaking Buffy's trance. Unaware of what
just happened, Buffy decides to call it a night and leaves Giles alone in the
library.<P>

Outside of school the next morning, Buffy notices a guy harassing Cordelia.
Buffy walks up to the guy and grabs him by the arm. However, she suddenly
realizes that she doesn't have enough strength to do anything to the guy, who
casually shoves her to the ground with that one arm. Buffy finds Giles in the
hallway and tells him about her disturbing loss of strength. Giles doesn't
show a great deal of concern, although he definitely knows why Buffy is going
through this. Giles speaks with Quentin at the boarding house, voicing his
disagreement with the Watcher Council's insistence on subjecting Buffy to the
Cruciamentum. The Cruciamentum is a test which all Slayers must endure when
they reach the age of eighteen in order to prove their instinctual skills and
resourcefulness. To do so, the Slayer must survive an encounter with a vicious
vampire while trapped inside a small space. In this case, Buffy must defeat an
insane vampire, Zackary Kralik, in the confines of this boarding house. After
Giles leaves, a loud, painful scream emanates from Kralik's coffin. Blair and
Hobson open the coffin and give Kralik his pills. Giles returns to the
library, where Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Oz try to find any relevant info in
the books that might explain her loss of power. While Buffy continues to
search for answers, Kralik's screaming keeps Blair and Hobson from getting any
rest. While Hobson takes a break, Blair opens the coffin to learn that Kralik
wants more pills. As Blair goes to the kitchen to fill the glass with water,
Kralik screams to cover up the sound of his straightjacket ripping at the
seams. Kralik then tricks Blair into stepping close to the coffin and grabs
him by the throat with his freed arm before sinking his fangs into his neck.
At the mansion, Angel gives a book of poetry to Buffy for her birthday.
Unfortunately, Buffy is distracted by her power loss to fully appreciate
Angel's gift. Buffy fears that she may have lost what made her special. Angel
consoles her by confessing that he watched her long before she moved to
Sunnydale, admitting that he loved her then every bit as much as he does now.
Meanwhile, Blair rises in front of Kralik as a newly-turned vampire. He picks
up an axe and frees Kralik from his restraints.<P>

Giles stops by the boarding house to check in on things, but nobody seems to
be around. After noticing blood on the stairway railing, Giles grabs a
make-shift stake and opens Kralik's tomb. Finding it empty, Giles goes to the
kitchen and discovers Hobson's dead corpse. Overcome by the grotesque sight
and smell, Giles runs out of the house. He needs to find Buffy, who is walking
the streets alone. She runs into Kralik, who grabs her jacket. Unable to fight
him as she normally would, Buffy turns and runs for her life. She tries to
climb over, then under a fence. Blair shows up and tries to pull her back, but
Buffy escapes and runs out into the middle of the street. Giles arrives just
in time, and Buffy jumps into his car. Back at the library, Giles tells the
whole truth to Buffy, showing her the syringe filled with an organic compound
of muscle relaxants and adrenal suppressers. He informs her that the effects
of the compound will wear off in a few days, but Buffy is too furious to care
about that right now. Giles goes on to tell her that he just invalidated the
test by telling her about it ahead of time. Unfortunately, Buffy refuses to
listen or forgive him. As soon as Cordelia walks into the library to do some
research for a paper, Buffy asks her for a ride home. While Cordelia drives
Buffy home, Joyce hears a noise on her front porch. She goes out and sees
Buffy's jacket draped over a figure. Assuming it's Buffy, she bends down
towards the covered figure. However, it's not Buffy at all, but really Kralik.
When Buffy arrives home, she finds a polaroid of her mother and Kralik. She
packs a large amount of her slaying supplies into her bag and heads towards
the mansion. Tied to a chair and gagged, Joyce can do nothing but watch as Kralik takes
countless polaroids of her while rambling about his hatred for mothers. Buffy
walks in through the main entrance of the boarding house and looks around. As
she realizes that all of the other exits have been sealed by bricks, Blair
locks the main entrance, trapping the Slayer inside.<P>

Meanwhile, Quentin visits Giles at the library and tells him that the
Cruciamentum has begun. Giles informs him that he disclosed all of the
information concerning the test, but none of that matters right now. He leaves
Quentin in the library and races towards the boarding house. Buffy encounters
Kralik and tries to take him out with her crossbow, but it's no use. He chases
Buffy through the house. She takes refuge inside a dark room. When she turns
the light on, Buffy sees that the walls are completely plastered with photos
of her helpless mother. She runs out of the room, and Kralik finally traps her
in the hallway. Buffy attempts to ward him off with a cross, but Kralik is so
insane that he actually enjoys the pain it causes. Before he can bite into her
neck, Kralik is suddenly seized by his painful need to take his pills. He
fishes the medicine bottle out of his pocket. Spotting an opportunity, Buffy
grabs the bottle out of his hands and dives through a laundry chute.<P>

Landing in the basement, Buffy finds Joyce on the chair. When Kralik reaches
the basement, Buffy tries to flee the scene with his pills. He rips the bottle
out of her hands and quickly grabs the nearby glass of water. After swallowing
the pills with the water, Kralik suddenly notices a burning sensation inside
himself. Buffy holds out an empty bottle of Holy Water. The blessed water soon
disintegrates Kralik. As Buffy works on freeing Joyce from the chair, both
Giles and Blair crash into the basement. Giles finishes the vampire off, then
leaves with Joyce and Buffy.<P>

In the library, Quentin commends Buffy on her successful passing of the test.
However, he has bad news for Giles. Since he has demonstrated a relationship
with Buffy that the Council has deemed too close, like the way a father loves
his daughter, Giles is relieved of his duties as Buffy's Watcher. Quentin then
tells Buffy that she will be assigned a new Watcher soon. Struck by this
revelation of how much Giles cares for her, Buffy calmly allows him to tend to
her wounds. Back at home, Buffy's friends try to make sense of Giles' being
fired... especially Willow, who almost refuses to believe the mere possibility
of Giles losing his job.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B>
<P>
We all fear the diminishment or loss of our faculties, but Buffy, who relies on hers not only to carry out her responsibilities but also to keep her alive, must fear it most acutely. That's the basis for David Fury's story, which also tests the limits of Buffy's increasingly father-daughter relationship with Giles in some heart-wrenching scenes. To put it bluntly, Giles betrays Buffy in this episode, and seriously endangers the life of his charge in order to placate the Council. 
<P>
There's little logic in the premise for the test - what would happen if the slayer was killed? Would that mean that they weren't capable of doing the job? Little wonder that Giles has a change of heart about what he calls &quot;an archaic exercise in cruelty&quot; and decides to disobey the Council's orders, although it does raise the question as to why it took him so long! Surely this points to a character flaw in the watcher, not the slayer? This story would have been far more interesting if Faith had been around to stir things up. After a couple of episodes without her - and with no adequate explanation for her absence (sorry, but &quot;unannounced walkabout&quot; just doesn't cut it) - the series seems to be drifting rather aimlessly.
<P>
<B>Trivia</B>
<P>
Zackary Kralik was played by an actor with some experience of being a vampire: Jeff Corber appeared in Fox's short-lived 1996 series 'Kindred: The Embraced'.
<P>
This episode marks Buffy's eighteenth birthday, explaining the original title of this episode: &quot;Eighteen&quot;.
<P>
There are several allusions to the Red Riding Hood story, notably Kralik's line 'Why did you come to the dark of the woods - to bring all these sweets to grandmother's house?' and Buffy's red coat (which Kralik uses to hide in - as the wolf in the story used Grandma's clothes).
<P>
Buffy's love of ice-skating was an idea introduced in 'What's My Line - Part I'. Her line 'Brian Boitano doing 'Carmen' is a life changer' refers to the American 1988 Olympic gold medallist skater. Boitano has a song devoted to him in 'South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut'.
<P>
<B>Chris's Notes</B>
<P>
It seems that halfway into the third season, Buffy the Vampire Slayer has entered another one of its dark(er) patches. The Buffy team follow up last week's story, where Mothers Opposed to the Occult decide to burn the town's Wiccan population, with a storyline which sees Buffy lose all faith in Giles, followed by Giles being relieved of his watcher duties. Also, while <A href="GINGERBREAD.html">Gingerbread</A> makes use of classic Buffy humour to brighten the episode's tone slightly, there isn't much of this evident during 'Helpless' until Kralik's death. Even then, Giles' redundancy (though it should be noted, he is still the school's librarian) hangs like a rather dark cloud over the Scooby Gang.
