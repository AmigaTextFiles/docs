<B>How to use this guide</B><P>

This is the HTML edition of Buffy.guide, a hypertext database of Buffy information (episodes,
charcters, reviews, newsletters, etc). If you aren't familiar with the HTML browsing system,
try calling up your browser's help system (eg. press HELP, F1, etc).<P>

There are several ways of navigating around this guide. Here is a brief description of each:<P>

<U>Browsing through the main page</U>
<BR>The main page has a list of all the
Buffy episodes that I currently have information on. Click on the links to
read outlines and comments for your chosen episode. There are also links to
information on most major characters in Buffy. <A href=MAIN.html>Click here</A> to go to the episode
list on the main page.<P>

<U>Using the index</U>
<BR>I've supplied an <A href=BUFFYINDEX.html>index</A> for the episode names, so you can
search for episodes alphabetically.<P>

<U>Using the Major Buffy Events list</U>
<BR>This is a chronological list of all the events of
particular significance in the Buffy story, eg. Angel's first kiss with Buffy.
<A href=EVENTS.html>Click here</A> to check it out.<P>

<U>Navigation buttons</U>
<BR>AmigaGuide-style navigation link-buttons are provided at the top of
most pages. For example there are Contents and Index buttons at the top of this page. I implemented these
buttons because going from using the AmigaGuide version to this one was infuriating, so I thought
I'd try to emulate the AmigaGuide environment here.

<P>
<BR><B>Other information available in the guide</B><P>

<U>Vamp Vocabulary</U><BR>A Slayer-Speak glossary. Handy if you want to sound like one
of the Scooby gang. Accessible via the <A href=MAIN.html>Main page</A>, or <A href=VAMPVOC.html>click here</A> to go to the
Vamp Vocab page.<P>

<U>Death Row</U><BR>A large catalogue of demons and villains from Buffy. You can find a
link to it on the <A href=MAIN.html>Main page</A> or <A href=BUFFYDEATHROW.html>click here</A> to go straight to Death Row.<P>

<U>Slayer's Circle</U><BR>Slayer's Circle is an email-based newsletter for Buffy fans,
which you can join at the <a href="http://www.buffyslayer.com">Official Buffy Website</a>, or read by <A href="SLAYERSCIRCLE.html">clicking here</A> instead!<P>

<BR><B>Why I did it...</B><P>

I created the AmigaGuide&reg; version at first for my own use... Not having Sky is a real
bummer when you want so desperately to be a Buffy expert. So at first, I went
to the BBC cult T.V. webpage on a PC at college to get information on the
episodes. This initial information was rather sketchy, but I put it into a
guide anyway. The next week I pointed that disgusting IE5 browser at
<A href="http://www.buffyslayer.com">the official Buffy website</a> and got some much better episode outlines. The BBC
information has now been relegated
to a section called &quot;More Information&quot; at the bottom of some of the episode
outlines.<P>

Some of the outlines have been edited slightly, to clarify some points or to add details. Some mistakes may remain, I'm afraid, but they're getting fixed as they're discovered. Anyway, here's an FAQ. I've also included some questions from the Buffy FAQ at <a href="http://www.buffyslayer.com">http://www.buffyslayer.com</A>
<P>

<BR><B>FAQ</B><P>

<B>Q:</B> Buffy the what...?
<BR><B>A:</B>  Maybe you're in the wrong place, dude! Actually, if
you're new to the series then you should be able to learn a lot from this
guide. Start at the beginning, and read through to the end, I guess!<P>

<B>Q:</B> Why do you need version numbers for an episode guide?!
<BR><B>A:</B> The main purpose of the version numbers is so you know whether of not you have the latest version of the guide. I know, it seems a little daft that the first public release was v1.4 but, as a measure of how Buffy.guide has evolved, it works. I won't pretend I know the first thing about version numbers :)

<B>Q:</B> Where can I find information on what might happen in thej future of Buffy? 
<BR><B>A:</B> Visit <a href="http://www.buffyslayer.com">the Official Buffy Website</a>, go to the postings board and there's usually
someone around there looking in a big crystal ball. Or probably talking to
their aunt Mildred who works in the make-up department...<P>

<B>Q:</B> How can I help you with the Buffy guide? <B>
<BR>A:</B> Thanks for asking. Firstly, any incorrect information that you spot in the guide, I'd like you to
email me about. Don't just think everyone else will because unfortunatly then no-one does.
If you are my best friend ever, you will send any of this info to
<a href="mailto:scoopee_uk@yahoo.co.uk">scoopee_uk@yahoo.co.uk</a> !!
<P>
<B>Q:</B> Are you a Buffy expert? <B><BR>A:</B> No way! The only Buffy expert is Joss, man.<P>

<B>Q:</B> Are you infringing copyright by making a guide of this information?
<BR><B>A:</B>  I sure hope not. There's an X-Files guide doing the rounds and as far as I
know there have been no objections to that. As for using other people's
episode descriptions... Well, I included all the credits that were on the web
(unlike the author of certain other guides, no names!) so I don't see
any problem. Besides, I'm promoting Buffy :-)<P>

<B>Q:</B> That Sarah Michelle Gellar, she's alright, isn't she? <B><BR>A:</B>  Yeah, she's cool
;) Hey, that's highly emotional coming from a college student like me...<P>

<B>Q:</B> Oh really? What do you do at college?<BR>
<B>A:</B> Nice of you to ask! I'm doing A-Level Computing and English Language,
and an A&#47;S Level in Electronics.
<P>
<B>Q:</B> Are you one of those college kids who smokes dope, gets pissed on cheap
cider and listens to Nirvana and Korn all day? <B><BR>A:</B>  Yup!<P>

<B>Q:</B> Where can I get nude pictures of Buffy? <B><BR>A:</B>  I think that's just an
internet rumour, dude! Anyway, why would you wanna see that? Okay, you're
curious... but come on, man! She's lovely with her clothes on, so don't
degrade her. I know there are various websites offering fake &quot;nude Buffy
pictures&quot; with Sarah's head pasted over the top of some porn star's face...
Sad, really. Very sad.<P>

<B>Q:</B> Why do you seem to assume that I'm male? <B><BR>A:</B>  Sorry. Are there female Amiga
users out there? In fact, are there any Amiga users <I>at all</I> out there...?
Hello...? Sorry, I accept that if you're female you might not be so attracted
to Sarah, dude.<P>

<B>Q:</B> Stop saying &quot;dude!&quot; <B><BR>A:</B>  No.<P>

<B>Q:</B> How do I write to one of the stars? <B><BR>A:</B> Their Name, c&#47;o Buffy the Vampire
Slayer, c&#47;o The Warner Brothers Television Network, 4000 Warner Blvd.,
Burbank, CA 91522<P>

<B>Q:</B> Can I link to the Buffy website? How? <B><BR>A:</B> Use this code to link, using the
button on the Buffy server:<P>

<B>Q:</B> Who are the people who post at the Buffy website who seem to be connected
to the show? <B><BR>A:</B><P>

</TABLE>
<P>

<BR><BR>NB: I <B>DO NOT</B> know who the secret people are... I've never even seen any of
them post either.<P>

<B>Q:</B> I don't like all the American spellings. You should correct them to real
English. <B><BR>A:</B> Oh, &quot;Real&quot; English?! Why is 'Colour' any more correct than
'Color'? Spelling is entirely arbitrary (look at the word Knight and then try
telling me you pronounce it exactly as it's spelt!) and therefore not worth
arguing about. Plus it's an American show, for crying out loud!<P>

<B>Q:</B> That's a weird attitude, since you're an English language student! <B><BR>A:</B> As
a linguist, I describe; I do not prescribe. Dude.<P>
