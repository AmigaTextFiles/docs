"Beg to differ, little lady!" - Ted
<P>
Buffy's mom Joyce's new beau, Ted seems too good to be true. He cooks and he's
a computer specialist -- making him an instant hit with both Xander and
Willow. At school, Giles awkwardly chats with Jenny Calendar, but she says his
concern about her well-being (since she's recovered from being a demon) is
getting on her nerves. Ted continues to charm the gang, until he talks to
Buffy alone at the mini-golf course and reveals a decidedly dark side. Buffy
puts on her Angela Lansbury hat and checks out Ted's place of business. She
finds out from a co-worker that he's engaged. She asks Joyce and Ted at dinner
if this is true, and Ted denies it -- but he's certainly hoping to ask Joyce
to marry him if all goes well. Buffy leaves and returns through her window as
usual, only to find Ted snooping through her things. He sees her slayer
journal, and threatens to show it to Joyce if Buffy doesn't toe the line. She
talks back to him, and he pummels her. A fight ensues and one of her blows
knocks him down the steps -- killing him.<P>

Buffy goes to school in a daze -- she's never killed someone who wasn't
already undead. Knowing Buffy wouldn't have tangled with someone just because
he was dating her mom, Xander, Willow and Cordelia try to figure out what Ted
was up to. Xander's extremely concerned, but suddenly says, &quot;Don't sweat it.&quot;
This is a big, honking clue to Willow, and she realizes what's caused Xander's
change of attitude -- he's eating one of Ted's homebaked cookies. Analysis
shows the cookies contain a tranquilizer. Then Cordelia investigates further
and finds out Ted has had four wives. Meanwhile, at the cemetery, Jenny
apologizes to Giles for being short with him, but their warm fuzzy moment is
interrupted by a vampire who attacks Giles. Jenny tries to shoot the demon
with Giles' crossbow, but hits Giles by accident. Giles removes the bow and
kills the demon. Buffy discovers the dead Ted in her room, looking remarkably
healthy. She stabs him with a nail file and discovers he's a robot. Xander,
Willow and Cordelia continue their sleuthing and stumble upon what's left of
Ted's ex-wives in his closet. Back at the Buffy's, Ted approaches Joyce, who
is freaked to see him, then glad to see him, then completely wigged when he
starts short-circuiting and revealing his intent to dominate her. Buffy whacks
him with a frying pan, exposing his robot face and killing him (although on
this show you never know...). At school, it's just another ordinary
post-slaying day at Sunnydale, until the gang discover Giles and Jenny making
out.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

'Ted' taps into some dark territory, and explores the feelings of alienation
and betrayal experienced by many children whose divorced parents start dating
someone new. Or, as Buffy more succinctly puts it: &quot;Seeing my mother Frenching
a guy is definitely a ticket to Therapyland!&quot; Buffy's dislike and distrust of
Ted runs counter to her friends' experience of him, which effectively isolates
her from them, too, so it's hardly surprising that she runs straight to Angel
when she needs a sympathetic ear! There are plenty of sly hints about Ted's
true identity in Greenwalt and Whedon's fully developed script, an
uncomplicated mystery story - albeit one with the usual 'Buffy' slant - packed
with events that conjure interesting emotional responses from the main
characters. As well as Buffy struggling to come to terms with her Mother's new
partner and her role as &quot;the dutiful daughter&quot;, we have Giles rebuilding his
fragile relationship with Jenny, following her possession in <A href=THEDARKAGE.html>The Dark Age</A>.<P>

Ted's apparent death is an excellent plot twist, and for a while it seems that
Buffy's judgement is highly questionable. Joyce's reaction, and the subsequent
police investigation, which raises some serious real-world issues about
domestic abuse, both provide rich dramatic potential that the writers are able
to casually discard without detriment to their robust story.<P>

'Three's Company' star John Ritter seems strangely miscast as Ted, and oddly
out of sync with the series' established tone. It's a role that requires the
range to convey rapid mood swings and subtle nuances, and would have proved a
challenge for even the most experienced actor.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

Pop culture: the conversation about The Captain and Tennille refers to a
famous pop duo whose career began as backing singers for the Beach Boys. In
1975 their Neil Sedaka-penned song &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot; became their
first hit as a duo, selling more than a million copies. Their singing career
flourished for nearly five years before they moved into television, where they
had their own series.<P>

Pop culture #2: The &quot;Stepford&quot; mention refers to 'The Stepford Wives', the
story about a town in Connecticut where all the women, who lead lives of
blissful domesticity, turn out to be robots. Ira Levin's novel was turned into
a film in 1975, starring Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss, which spawned two
awful TV movie sequels.<P>
