<P>
Marc Blucas has had the rare opportunity to come within reach of two lifelong
dreams: playing professional basketball and achieving Hollywood stardom with
feature film roles and a recurring role as Buffy's (Sarah Michelle Gellar) new
beau during season four on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; <P>

Born and raised in a small Pennsylvania town, Blucas' storybook childhood was
centered on his talent for playing basketball, a gift that brought his high
school team two state championships and earned him a scholarship to Wake
Forest University. An Academic All-American and starter on the Division I
team, Blucas graduated with a degree in business and communications. <P>

After playing professionally for a year overseas, he left his hoop dreams
behind and turned his focus to acting. Yet, it was his prowess on the
basketball court that landed his first acting role, starring with Whoopi
Goldberg in the sports-themed feature film &quot;Eddie.&quot; <P>

In the big-screen drama &quot;Pleasantville,&quot; he landed a role as a high school
basketball player from an open call audition. His experience on the court also
came in handy as he was hired as a technical advisor on the film, casting the
other players, consulting on the sports dialogue and choreographing the game
scenes. He most recently appeared in the independent comedy &quot;Mating Habits of
the Earthbound Human&quot; and the thriller &quot;House on Haunted Hill.&quot; <P>

On television, Blucas has starred in several television movies, including &quot;The
Jim Valvano Story&quot; about the famous basketball coach for which he also served
a technical advisor for the game scenes, and &quot;Inflammable&quot; with Kris
Kristofferson. He also appeared opposite Jerry O'Connell in the miniseries
&quot;The 60's&quot; and guest-starred on &quot;Arli$$&quot; and MTV's &quot;Undressed.&quot; <P>

When not working, Blucas spends his free time as a referee for a youth
basketball league in Los Angeles.
