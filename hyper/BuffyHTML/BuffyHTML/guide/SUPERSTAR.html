At the cemetery, Buffy, Willow, Anya and Xander battle two acrobatic vampires.
Buffy manages to stake them both with some help from her friends and decides
to check out the tomb they came out of. The gang follows her into the dank
chamber where they encounter a nest of vampires feasting on a body. Greatly
outnumbered, they decide to retreat before their presence is noticed. Needing
help, they go to the one man that can aid them. After walking into a lush
mansion, they approach a massive desk and ask the person concealed behind the
chair for help. The chair swivels around to reveal Jonathan Levinson, the
Sunnydale High geek, looking suave and dangerous. At Giles' house, Buffy,
Willow, Xander, Anya, Jonathan and Giles discuss their plan of attack on the
vampire nest. Jonathan has all the answers and the group decides they should
pretty much stick behind him. When they enter the tomb to do battle, vampires
rush at the gang from all sides. Buffy manages to kill two of them but
Jonathan emerges as the real hero, dusting vampires right and left with a
crossbow while kicking and flipping his way across the room. When the group
emerges from the tomb, there's plenty of paparazzi waiting to score a candid
photo of the leather-clad Jonathan. When Spike appears on the scene, Jonathan
is quick to confront him. With no need to attack the harmless ex-vamp,
Jonathan settles for giving him a good tongue-lashing and swaggers off.<P>

That night at Tara's, Willow details the night's action as they make a collage
on the wall. Tara is intrigued by Willow's tale and asks how Buffy is doing
with Riley since he inadvertently slept with Faith. Willow assures her that
they'll get over it as she puts the last cut-out Jonathan head on their
tributary collage. Meanwhile, in Riley's room, Buffy and Riley attempt to
smooth out their crumbling love life. When Riley tries to give Buffy a kiss,
she just can't get Faith out of her head and has to leave. She decides to get
some sage advice from Jonathan whom she meets at a diner. Between signing
autographs for starstruck fans, Jonathan explains to Buffy that her hang-ups
with Riley are in her head. If she wants everything to be alright with him,
she needs to let herself love him. Later, Colonel George Haddoway introduces
himself at the Initiative Headquarters as the new Commander In Chief until
someone else is appointed to take over command. In briefing the soldiers on
Adam, he introduces Jonathan to give his perspective. Jonathan, in military
fatigues, shows the men a blueprint of Adam's body. He explains that there is
a cache of Uranium 235 that will keep him alive forever. Cutting his head off
or stabbing him in the heart will not stop him; his body needs to be
annihilated.<P>

After the meeting, Jonathan gives Riley some advice on how women want to be
treated. He explains to Riley that Buffy needs to be reassured that Faith
meant nothing to him and her sexual maturity can't compare to Buffy's
sensuality. That night at Jonathan's mansion, a young woman is trying to catch
a glimpse of her idol from the backyard with binoculars. Suddenly she is
attacked by a bony, wolf-like demon that she barely fends off for the time
being. Meanwhile, at the Bronze, Buffy, Riley, Xander, Anya, Willow and Tara
enjoy drinks and discuss Jonathan. Suddenly he hits the stage in a white
tuxedo and sings a lounge song dedicated to Buffy and Riley. This inspires the
troubled couple to reclaim their love for each other. Suddenly Karen, the fan
who was attacked by the demon at Jonathan's estate, comes running in having
narrowly escaped its slashing claws. The gang takes her back to Jonathan's
where she describes it in detail. When she draws a symbol she saw on its head,
Jonathan begins acting suspicious. He tells everyone that it is nothing more
than an animal from the nearby woods that he will take care of on his own.<P>

Meanwhile, Adam and one of his followers gather information at a house they
invaded. When Adam sees Jonathan on television, he tries to explain to his
vampire soldier that reality has been changed. Everyone is under a spell
except himself because his molecular structure is more in tune with the
surrounding world than any human, demon or member of the undead. Across town,
when Tara enters her building on her way to bed, she is attacked out of the
blue by the same demon that was outside Jonathan¹s house. She is instantly
pinned beneath the howling beast but manages to whip together a spell that
shoots dust in its face. With her attacker distracted for a moment, she bolts
out from beneath it and bounds into a janitor's closet. A few hours later she
is found by a student huddled up in shock, and brought to Willow and Buffy's
room. When Buffy comes home, she shows the symbol that Karen drew to the still
rattled Tara. Tara states that it was present on the demon's head that
attacked her.<P>

Buffy begins questioning Jonathan's bizarre lack of compliance to help find
the creature and calls a meeting at Giles'. When the gang gets there she
explains that it seems impossible that Jonathan has done so many great things,
including coaching the US Women's soccer team to an Olympic Gold. She explains
a theory that they could be living in an alternate universe that could be
created by a spell like the ones Anya used to create. She shows them a photo
in a Jonathan Swimsuit Calendar in which the same symbol from the demon is
displayed on his back in scar tissue. Suddenly Jonathan walks in and questions
their inquisitive glances. When asked about the scar, Jonathan gives a bizarre
explanation that seems to satisfy everyone but Buffy. Buffy asks Jonathan to
go on patrol with her to put the demon¹s reign of terror to an end.<P>

At the cemetery, Buffy and Jonathan come across Spike, lurking by a tomb. To
extract information from him, Buffy threatens to put an embargo on the
butchers that supply Spike with blood. The reluctant Spike discloses the
location of a vampire lair that was recently invaded by something powerful.
Knowing that this is probably the handywork of their demon, the Slayer and the
hero leave in pursuit. Meanwhile, back at Giles', Willow finds Jonathan's
symbol in one of the Watcher's medieval tomes. It says that the bearer of the
symbol has performed an augmentation spell, affecting how everyone perceives
him or her. She immediately figures out that Jonathan must have used it to
make himself a para-god. It continues that, with the spell, comes a force of
evil to counter the power of its conjurer. The only way to end the spell is to
kill its evil spawn. It dawns on them that the demon Buffy and Jonathan are
after is obviously the spinoff of the augmentation spell and Jonathan will
probably do anything he can to prevent it from being destroyed. Meanwhile, in
the cavernous lair that Spike pointed them to, Buffy and Jonathan come across
the demon. Rather than helping it kill Buffy, Jonathan realizes that the
charade is going to hurt people he actually cares about and helps her fight
it. When it has Buffy on the edge of a vast pit, Jonathan attempts to
sacrifice himself, tackling the demon into the pit. At the last second Buffy
catches his ankle as the demon plummets into darkness and Jonathan is returned
to his normal self.<P>

The next day the gang sits on the front lawn of campus, marveling at the fact
that they have full memory of worshipping the high school twerp. When Jonathan
shows up to apologize, Buffy explains that people aren't necessarily as mad at
him for creating a demon that endangered lives, but for treating them as sock
puppets in his game. Jonathan leaves remorseful, but before he does he tells
Buffy that he did mean what he said about letting herself love Riley. That
night, as Buffy and Riley sink into a passionate kiss, their relationship is
restored.<P>
