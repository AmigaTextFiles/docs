<P>
In the middle of her psych class, Buffy daydreams about an
uncharacteristically apologetic Parker, who begs her forgiveness after a
surprise vampire attack. Professor Walsh's lecture snaps Buffy back to
reality, and she looks down a few rows to see Parker putting his trademark
moves on yet another female victim. After class, Xander finds Buffy and Willow
and tells them of his recent employment as bartender at the campus pub.<P>

That night, Buffy stops by the pub and sees Parker entertaining a girl at one
of the booths. She bumps into Riley, who gives her the lowdown on Parker's
womanizing habits. Buffy pulls up a stool at the bar, where Xander is finding
some difficulty getting into the groove of the job. Fed up, Buffy is getting
ready to leave when she is stopped by several guys who demand her presence at
their table. Seeing Parker leave the pub with his latest prize, Buffy decides
to accept the guys' offer. In no time, she finds herself guzzling several
glasses of beer with her newfound friends. Meanwhile, at the Bronze, Willow
notices Oz's overwhelming interest in the on stage band, Shy. He is
particularly drawn to the lead singer, Veruca, a familiar girl who seems to
share a mutual interest in Oz. Elsewhere, a man prepares a mixture of several
chemicals and stores it in a keg of Black Frost beer, the same brand that
Buffy was drinking with the guys earlier.<P>

The next morning, Willow returns to the dorm and finds Buffy deeply fascinated
by their television set. On their way out to psych class, Willow has to remind
her roommate to get dressed. At class, Buffy eyes a classmate eating a
sandwich. Buffy snatches the sandwich and hungrily scarfs it down. Later, Oz
stops by Stevenson Hall and tells Willow that he's been invited by Veruca and
her band to watch their show that night. Willow opts to take a pass, leaving
Oz to go alone. While Oz heads to the Bronze, Willow decides to drop by the
Grotto, where she finds Parker sitting by himself. She approaches Parker and
proceeds to berate him for causing Buffy so much distress. In his defence,
Parker tries to explain his philosophy of short-term relationships.<P>

As Willow settles into the conversation, Buffy throws back another round of
beers with the guys at the pub. Concerned with their increasingly primal
behavior, Xander forces a reluctant Buffy to call it a night and head back to
the dorm. Deciding that the other guys have had enough as well, Xander asks
them to pay the bill. While he collects the money, one of the guys heads to
the bathroom. Moments later, he emerges as a hairy, caveman- like grunt. While
he knocks Xander to the floor, the others undergo similar transformations.
Xander scares them off with his lighter, then runs into the back room to warn
his boss, Jack. However, Jack reveals to Xander that he made the special
formula in order to get back at the pretentious students.<P>

Back at the Grotto, Parker attempts to lure Willow into seeing things his way.
On the contrary, Willow doesn't buy his act for a second. Just as she's about
to leave, the caveman storm into the grotto, dragging a couple of helpless
girls inside with them. Before they can escape, Willow and Parker are knocked
unconscious by the rampaging savages.<P>

Meanwhile, Xander gets Giles and takes him to Buffy's dorm, hoping the beer
hasn't transformed the Slayer yet. Upon entering the room, they find Buffy
drawing figures on the wall and pounding her chest, although her physical
features are still unchanged. Xander and Giles try to secure Buffy, but she
flees from the room.<P>

Xander tracks Buffy down outside, but their attention is soon drawn to a
pillar of smoke rising from the Grotto. Buffy makes it there first, and she
finds the place going down in flames. Recognizing Willow on the other side of
the flames, Buffy leaps to her friend's side. Buffy then spots a window wide
enough for them to escape through, so she leaps up to kick it open. The
cavemen take the escape route, followed by the two girls left behind.<P>

Xander helps Willow out through the window as Buffy pushes from inside.
Instead of exiting right away, Buffy picks up a large piece of wood and
inspects it thoroughly. Nearby, Parker regains consciousness and begs Buffy
for help. Buffy swings the wood onto Parker's head, knocking him back to
submission. She then drags him outside.<P>

Soon, ambulances and fire trucks arrive on the scene to save what's left of
the Grotto. Xander locks the cavemen in a van, knowing that the effects of the
beer will wear off in several days. In a strange reenactment of her daydream
from the other day, Buffy listens to Parker asking her to forgive him. Still
under the influence of Jack's formula, Buffy responds by clobbering Parker
with the wood once again.<P>
