<U>IMPORTANT NOTICE</U>
<P>
I found out recently to my absolute horror (really!) that the Slayer's Circle letters I had so far were only part of volume 4, and three other volumes existed! It's tedious enough just to reformat 10 of these letters in a row (there's more to do than you'd think) never mind about 256 of the damn things!
<P>
Thinking about this and the fact that the information is usually out of date by the time it's uploaded to Aminet, made me realise how very little I actually use Slayer's Circle, and it makes no sense to keep it if no-one uses it. So if you use it, email me and tell me. Otherwise I'm scrapping it. Slayer's Circle <B>will be deleted entirely</B> if no emails are received by lunchtime on Friday December 1st, 2000. Put into your subject line, something like 'KEEP SLAYER'S CIRCLE' to make sure I read it straight away. Sorry if you think this is a bit harsh. Some people are too afraid to remove redundant features from their guides or programs. Not me, dude.
<P>
You need not feel guilt for not using this section. I want to know how many people use it, not how many people think it would be a shame if it goes. But anyway for now, here's the Slayer's Circle newsletters.
