With Homecoming approaching, Cordelia plans to start her campaign for the
title of Homecoming queen, while the rest of the gang debates on their mode of
transportation to the dance. Buffy, however, is still distracted by Angel's
recent return, so she takes off for the mansion shortly after Scott asks her
to the dance. At the mansion, Buffy assures Angel that nobody else knows that
he's back. To Angel's dismay, Buffy also tells him that she's currently seeing
another guy. Unfortunately, that statement doesn't hold true for much longer,
for Scott dumps Buffy the very next morning. He explains that the down and
depressed Buffy he knows now is not the same Buffy he knew before they started
dating. After Scott leaves, Buffy wanders around outside of the school
alone... and completely unaware of the two German men who are watching her
from inside a van. Using state-of-the-art equipment, they transmit their
visual to a lavish mansion, where an old man receives the signal and shows the
image of Buffy to his boss: Mr. Trick.<P>

At City Hall, Mayor Richard Wilkins III learns from his deputy mayor that two
German brothers with impressive criminal records have recently been spotted in
Sunnydale. Their names are Frederick and Hans Gruenshtahler, and they're the
same two men who have been spying on Buffy. The Mayor isn't too worried about
this. In fact, he's more concerned with cleanliness and personal hygiene,
which he displays by closely inspecting his deputy mayor's hands. Meanwhile,
at Sunnydale High, the senior class gets its pictures taken in the lounge for
their fourth and final high school yearbook. Buffy's a no-show, so Cordelia
heads to the library to tell her about the photo session. Before she can enter
the library, Cordy is distracted by her Homecoming queen campaign priorities
and completely forgets to inform Buffy. Inside the library, Buffy and Faith
plan to attend the dance together since Scott is no longer in the picture.<P>

The next day, Buffy asks one of her favorite teachers from the previous school
year, Ms. Moran, to write her a recommendation to give to Principal Snyder.
Buffy needs the recommendation to fulfill one of the conditions set by Snyder
for her readmittance. However, Ms. Moran can't even remember Buffy's name, let
alone anything about her to merit a written recommendation. Buffy's woes
increase at lunch when she learns from Xander and the others that she missed
the yearbook photo session. Upset with Cordy's irresponsibility, Buffy
approaches the Homecoming queen candidate and speaks her mind. Naturally,
Cordy retaliates with her own special brand of verbal abuse. This motivates
Buffy to compete with Cordy and run for Homecoming queen herself. Later that
night, Mr. Trick assembles a promising group of hunters at his mansion for an
event called Slayerfest '98. Included in this group of hunters: Frawley, a
human hunter with a rifle and a set of bear traps; Lyle and Candy Gorch, two
recently-married vampires; Frederick and Hans Gruenshtahler, the German
brothers who have been tracking Buffy's every move; and Kulak, a
yellow-skinned demon who keeps jagged blades inside his forearms. Mr. Trick
hopes this Slayerfest will see the end of both Buffy and Faith. Meanwhile, at
the Rosenberg residence, Xander helps Willow pick out a dress for the dance
while he tries on the tuxedo he'll be wearing. Initially, they discuss their
relationships with Cordelia and Oz. However, after Willow puts on her best
dress and Xander completes his attire, the only thing on their minds is each
other. While Xander gives Willow a brief lesson on dancing, the two best
friends lose themselves in the moment and share a kiss. That moment is quickly
interrupted when they both realize what they've done, both to themselves and
their significant others.<P>

The next morning, Buffy learns that she'll be campaigning alone, since all of
her friends have already committed to helping Cordy. Buffy and Cordy kick
their Homecoming queen campaigns into full gear, hoping to outdo each other in
the race for the title. While Buffy convinces Willow to give her a little
help, Frederick and Hans listen in on their conversation. They pay particular
attention to Buffy's announcement that the limo will pick up Faith first,
Buffy second, and the rest of the group afterwards. Later in the day, Buffy
learns that Cordy has been paying some of the students money to get their
votes. This leads to another argument between the two candidates, only this
one ends on a much harsher note. Distraught, Willow tells Xander that their
brief tryst must be partly responsible for the current feud between Buffy and
Cordelia. Eventually, Xander and Willow's conversation turns to the bigger
problem at hand: what are they themselves going to do now. Later that night,
the limo stops at the Summers home to pick up Buffy as planned. Buffy is
surprised to find Cordy inside instead of Faith. According to a note written
by the gang, Buffy and Cordy will be taking the limo to the dance alone so
that they may work out their differences before the crowning of the Homecoming
queen.<P>

Included with the note are a couple of corsages. The limo's destination is not
the dance, however, but rather the nearby woods. Buffy and Cordy step out of
the limo and notice a monitor and VCR set up on a table, along with a sign
that informs them to play the tape.<P>

Buffy and Cordy watch a recording of Mr. Trick, who welcomes Buffy and Faith
to Slayerfest '98. Apparently, they expected Faith to be in Cordy's place.
Before Cordy can clear up the confusion, the monitor explodes, and the hunt
begins. The first hunter they run into is Frawley, who Buffy immobilizes by
knocking him into one of his own traps. Unable to free his leg, Frawley
informs Buffy and Cordy of the rest of the hunter group.<P>

While Buffy and Cordy take refuge inside a cabin, Xander and Willow find
themselves guilty and ashamed at the dance, even after Giles commends them on
their effort to resolve the feud between Buffy and Cordy. In the cabin, Cordy
finds a telephone which Buffy uses to call Giles at the library. Buffy
explains to Cordy that she's running for Homecoming queen because she wants a
high school memory that doesn't involve her job as the Slayer. Suddenly, Kulak
bursts into the cabin and attacks Buffy. During their battle, Frederick and
Hans approach the cabin. They are being navigated by the old man, who is
tracking Buffy and Cordy with his computer system back at the mansion. The
German brothers fire an explosive device into the cabin, which causes Buffy to
stop her battle with Kulak and escape with Cordy. Kulak fails in his attempt
to get out of the cabin, and he is killed in the explosion. Buffy and Cordy
get up from the ground and head back to the library, unaware that Lyle and
Candy Gorch have knocked out Giles and are waiting for them to arrive.<P>

While Buffy and Cordy head to the library, a pair of police officers arrive at
Mr. Trick's mansion and escort him away, against his will. At the library,
Buffy fights with Candy Gorch before dusting her. Enraged, Lyle moves in to
attack, but Cordy stops him short and launches into an impressive speech that
scares Lyle into taking off. After Giles regains consciousness, he points out
that he wasn't aware of the group buying corsages for Buffy and Cordy. Buffy
notices small electronic devices in the corsages, which the old man must have
been using to track their movements. They hear the German brothers in the
hallway, so Buffy binds the bugs together with a bundle of wet toilet paper.
After leading one of the brothers into a classroom, she throws the mass of
toilet paper onto his back. The old man gives the other brother the
coordinates, and both Frederick and Hans proceed to shoot each other dead.
Meanwhile, the two police officers bring Mr. Trick to City Hall, where Mayor
Wilkins introduces himself. He reveals that he's quite aware that Mr. Trick is
a vampire, and he wants his help in eliminating the &quot;rebellious element&quot; from
Sunnydale. Mr. Trick realizes that the Mayor is referring to the Slayers.<P>

At the dance, Buffy and Cordy finally arrive, only to learn that neither of
them is the new Homecoming queen, for the other two candidates win the
election in a tie.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

The Homecoming dance is one of those weird American customs that seems
somewhat bizarre to English audiences and 'Homecoming' is based on the
strangest aspect of the whole notion: the Homecoming Queen contest, a concept
that summons up heady 'Wicker Man'-type images of lambs being led to the
slaughter.<P>

The highlight of the episode, and, not coincidentally, the only element of the
story that has any lasting resonance, is the kiss between Xander and Willow
which revives a storyline that harks back to the groundwork laid out in the
series' earliest episodes.<P>

It's a scene that's rather clumsily set up, but it's rescued by David
Greenwalt's sharp dialogue and direction and, especially, by excellent comic
performances by Alyson and Nicholas. The rest of the episode doesn't seem to
know where to settle. There's no real symbiosis between the plot strands about
the two parallel contests (the Homecoming Queen competition and SlayerFest),
but at least pairing Buffy and Cordelia as the SlayerFest prey re-establishes
some of the self-centred rivalry that made Cordelia so sparky. Her
confrontation with Lyle Gorch is a joy to behold, as is her dumbfounded
astonishment at not being voted Homecoming Queen.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

This episode probably owes a debt of gratitude to the 1932 RKO movie 'The Most
Dangerous Game', about a sadistic Count who hunts shipwrecked humans on his
own personal Malayan island. The Count eventually met his match when pitted
against a big game hunter. The movie was based on a well-known short story by
Richard Connell, which has been filmed many times: most notably in 1946 (as 'A
Game of Death'), in 1951 (as 'The Black Castle'), in 1954 (as 'The Black
Forest'), in 1956 (as 'Run for The Sun') and in 1961 (as 'Bloodlust'). The
1932 movie, made by the same team that created 'King Kong', is by far the best
and most popular version. (In the UK it was re-titled 'The Hounds of
Zaroff').<P>

Lyle Gorch was one of the vampire brothers that Buffy encountered in <A href=BADEGGS.html>Bad Eggs</A>,
during which the other brother is killed by the Bazoar.<P>

After he was mentioned in many previous episodes, 'Homecoming' is the first to
actually feature the Mayor, Richard Wilkins III (Ian Abercrombie). It also
introduces Deputy Mayor Allan Finch (Jack Plotnick). Look out, too, for
Jonathan (Danny Strong), the geek whose vote Cordelia has bought for six
dollars (&quot;That buys a whole lotta cupcakes!&quot;). Jonathan has appeared regularly
in Buffy (his debut was in 'Inca Mummy Girl'). Keep an eye on him, because one
day he's going to be a <A href=SUPERSTAR.html>Superstar</A> !<P>
