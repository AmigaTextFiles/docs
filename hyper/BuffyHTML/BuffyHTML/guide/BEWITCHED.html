"The only way you could get other girls to like you would be witchcraft!" - Cordelia
<P>
The night before Valentine's Day, Xander shows Buffy his V-Day gift for Cordy:
a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant. After cracking a few jokes, Buffy
assures Xander that Cordy will love his gift. She then slays a vampire which
rises from its grave, and they continue on with their conversation.<P>

The next morning, Harmony and her friends are shunning Cordy from their
discussion groups. They mock Cordy for dating Xander, whom they perceive to be
one of the biggest losers in Sunnydale. Elsewhere, Amy asks Willow and Buffy
if they plan on attending the V-Day party at the Bronze later that night.
Willow is going to see Oz play in the band, while Buffy plans on staying home.
As everyone leaves and hands in their assignment, Xander notices that Amy does
not have a paper to turn in. To his surprise, he watches as Amy stares at Miss
Beakman, the teacher. Miss Beakman then reaches out her hand, as if she is
taking Amy's paper which doesn't even exist. Amy then turns and leaves. Xander
catches up with Buffy and Willow, telling them that he suspects Amy of messing
around with witchcraft. Buffy and Willow remind him that it was Amy's mother,
Catherine, who was the witch, and that Amy would never fool around with it.
Giles spots Buffy and approaches her. Jenny Calendar sees them and walks over,
but Giles brushes her off, saying that he and Buffy are busy at the moment. In
the library, Giles warns Buffy that Angel has a long past of committing horrid
acts on Valentine's Day. He refuses to tell Buffy any specifics, however, but
he does suggest that she be careful. Meanwhile, in the factory, Spike and
Angel give Drusilla their V-Day gifts. Spike gives her a necklace, while Angel
gives her a freshly torn-out heart.<P>

That night, Buffy receives a box of roses, which were left at her doorstep.
Buffy opens the box and finds a card with only one word written on it: &quot;Soon&quot;.
At the Bronze, Xander sees Cordy and walks over to give her his gift. After
admiring the necklace for a moment, Cordy breaks up with him. Xander is
righteously furious, and it only gets worse for him the next day, as everyone
in school seems to know that they broke up. Xander then notices Amy walking
around, so he runs over and tells her that he knows she's practicing
witchcraft. With the upper hand, Xander strikes a deal with Amy: help him cast
a love spell on Cordy, and nobody will have to know that she's a witch. After
arguing the idea for a while, Amy concedes and tells Xander that she needs a
personal item of Cordelia's.<P>

Xander finds Cordy near her locker and demands that she return the necklace he
gave her. Cordy says it's in her locker, but when she opens it, she hides
behind the locker door so she can remove the necklace from her neck without
Xander seeing. Meanwhile, Buffy walks into the library and shows Giles the
&quot;Soon&quot; card. Buffy demands that Giles tell her everything she needs to know
about Angel and Valentine's Day, so Giles sits her down and proceeds to read
various anecdotes from his books.<P>

In a darkened room, Amy and Xander perform the spell that should cause Cordy
to fall in love with him. However, Xander soon finds out that the spell had no
effect on Cordy. He walks into the library where Buffy is still listening to
Giles read his books. Buffy consoles Xander, then suggests that they spend
some time together that night. Buffy's suggestions get increasingly lurid, but
before they get too close, Amy walks in and tells Xander that she needs to
have a word with him. Outside in the hall, Amy tells Xander that the spell
didn't work. Xander could care less know, seeing how his dreams of Buffy and
himself are finally being fulfilled. However, Amy then suggests that they
spend some time together later that night, without the spells and other
witchcraft. Xander grows suspicious, and his fears are confirmed when another
girl approaches and asks him to accompany her that night. Xander realizes that
the spell actually worked. However, instead of affecting Cordy, it zapped
every other girl in Sunnydale. Xander goes home to avoid everybody, only to
find Willow waiting for him in his bed. Willow wants to him to take her right
there in his bed, and when things get a little too steamy between them, Xander
pushes her off and runs off.<P>

The next day, every single girl in the school ogles Xander as he walks down
the hall. He quickly enters the library and tells Giles everything that's
going on. Before Giles can process the information, Jenny walks in and tells
Giles that they need to talk. However, her attention quickly shifts to Xander,
proving that the spell affected not only the girls, but every single female in
town. Giles gets between the two and berates Xander for causing all this to
happen. He then leaves Xander in the library, dragging Jenny along with him.
After they leave, Xander tries to barricade the entrance to the library, but
Buffy simply walks in, wearing nothing but a raincoat. She seductively asks
Xander to undress her, but he can't, for he knows that what Buffy is doing is
not out of attraction for him, but simply a result of the spell. Just then,
Amy arrives and tells Buffy to leave. Instead, Buffy punches her to the floor.
Angered, Amy gets up and casts a spell on Buffy, turning her into the small
rat. Giles and Jenny return just then. While Xander and Giles try to catch the
rat, Oz walks into the library and punches Xander for whatever he did to
depress Willow. While Xander assures Oz that nothing happened, the rat escapes
through the partly-opened library door. Realizing that the rat is gone, Giles
commands Xander and Oz to find the rat while he tries to get Amy to reverse
the spells. Giles soon determines that Amy must have made a mistake in the
casting that caused Cordy to be protected by the spell instead of affected by
it.<P>

In the hallway, Xander notices a fight breaking out. To his horror, he sees a
mob of girls beating on Cordy. The mob is angry at Cordy for breaking Xander's
heart. Rushing in through the love-crazed girls, Xander pulls Cordy out of the
pack and runs away with her. They run outside, only to find Willow and dozens
of other girls. Willow is wielding an axe, for she would rather see Xander
dead than with Cordy. While the mobs of girls battle each other, Xander and
Cordy escape through the commotion and end up at Buffy's house.<P>

Joyce lets them in and, after sending Cordy upstairs to get some bandages,
starts seducing Xander. Cordy is sickened by this, so she pushes Joyce
outside. Joyce punches through the door window and struggles to unlock the
door, so Xander and Cordy run upstairs and hide in Buffy's room. Thinking
they're safe, Angel suddenly arrives and pulls Xander through the window and
throws him to the ground below. Before Angel can kill him, Drusilla arrives
and protects Xander. While Angel leaves, Dru offers immortal life to Xander.
Before she can sink his teeth into his neck, the mob of girls finally track
them down. They pull Xander away from Dru and pile up on top of Xander. Cordy
runs out and pulls Xander out from the pile before quickly running back
inside. All the girls chase them into the house. That is, everyone except Dru.
Angel reminds her that she can't get in without an invitation. Xander and
Cordy run into the basement and lock themselves in there. Meanwhile, Oz tracks
the rat into the school basement. The rat is first menaced by a cat, then
approaches a mouse trap. Upstairs, Giles and Amy perform the reversal spells.
They first reverse the spell on Buffy, causing her to transform back to her
human self. She quickly realizes that she is completely naked, so she asks Oz
to find her some clothes.<P>

While Giles and Amy work on reversing the love spell, the mob of girls break
open the basement door. Xander and Cordy run downstairs, but there's nowhere
to go. Soon, all the girls gang up on top of them. Finally, Giles and Amy
complete the reversal spell, and everybody returns to normal. All the girls
look around, completely confused as to what's going on. Cordy makes up an
excuse that they had just finished a scavenger hunt.<P>

The next day, Buffy thanks Xander for not taking advantage of her the previous
day. It seems that everybody retained their memory of what occurred during the
run of the spell. Xander then bumps into Harmony, who is walking with Cordy
and the rest of their friends. After Harmony mocks Xander, Cordy has had
enough. She rips on Harmony and tells everybody that she can date whoever she
wants to date. Cordy then walks over to Xander and takes his hand. Cordy is
horrified by what she's just done, but Xander comforts her, and the two of
them walk off, together again.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

Of all the regular characters, it's Xander that's least likely to be the focus
of any particular episode. He plays an important role in every episode,
providing much of the humour that's made the series so popular and accessible,
but he's a follower rather than an instigator. 'Bewitched, Bothered and
Bewildered' is a formulaic episode that seems to have been created as some
kind of loyalty bonus for Nicholas Brendon, who manages to carry things very
adeptly.<P>

Marti Noxon nails the spurned Xander's motivation for starting the trouble in
this episode in one line: &quot;I want her to want me desperately, so I can break
up with her, and subject her to the same hell she's been putting me through&quot;.
Thanks to Amy and the lovelorn Xander we get to see a whole new side to
several characters, most notably the sultry version of Willow!<P>

The episode is enlivened by Christophe Beck's wonderfully energetic score and,
especially, by James Contner's imaginative direction. Contner manages to bring
a sense of momentum that probably wasn't apparent from the script, and also
instils the episode with a sense of creeping terror. He also draws winning
performances from the cast, who probably haven't had this much fun since
<A href=HALLOWEEN.html>Halloween</A>.<P>

Noxon's witty script contains a lot of sparkling dialogue, including one sly
line that qualifies as one of the series' best, when Angel delivers a
still-warm human heart to Drusilla, as a Valentine's Day present: &quot;I found it
in a quaint little shop girl.&quot; The episode's official synopsis contains a
minor detail that didn't make the final edit: when the love potion spell is
broken, Amy hands her spell book to Giles. Its omission is possibly a sign
that the series' producers aren't quite finished with Amy yet...<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

It's rather apt that it's Oz who finds the naked Buffy in the school basement,
after her spell as a rat, since it's a predicament he must have found himself
in many times before, as in <A href=PHASES.html>Phases</A>. For an amusing elaboration of this
scenario, see John Landis' superb 1981 movie 'An American Werewolf In
London'.<P>
