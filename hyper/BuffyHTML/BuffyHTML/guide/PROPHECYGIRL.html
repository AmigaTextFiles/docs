"By the way, I really like your dress!" - Willow, The Master, Angel...
<P>

At the Bronze, Xander rehearses asking Buffy out to the prom by trying his
speech out on lovesick Willow. Meanwhile, Buffy is having a closer call than
usual with her vampire attackers. Giles reads a frightening prophecy about the
Master and the Slayer, and an earthquake hits Sunnydale.<P>

Buffy tells Giles about her attack, and lets him know that she's starting to
get scared. When Xander finally gets the nerve to ask her out, she turns him
down, saying she doesn't think of him &quot;that way&quot; and doesn't want to spoil
their friendship. In the library, Giles and Ms. Calendar discuss the prophecy:
the earthquake, along with several strange occurrences in Sunnydale, seem to
confirm that the apocalypse is near. Buffy overhears Giles telling Angel,
&quot;Tomorrow she'll face the Master and she will die.&quot; Buffy freaks out and tells
Giles she wants to quit. More signs of the end appear: a roomful of students,
including Cordelia's new beau, are found dead at school, totally unnerving
Willow, who discovers their bodies. Buffy decides that even though she's
afraid, only she can try to save the world by facing the Master. She goes out
with a crossbow, and the Anointed One leads her to the Master. Meanwhile,
Xander enlists Angel's help in trying to protect Buffy.<P>

The Master bites Buffy, and she drops into a puddle. This allows him to break
through to the &quot;other side.&quot; Xander and Angel find Buffy, and Xander is able
to revive her using CPR. Meanwhile, Cordelia, Willow and Ms. Calendar find
themselves driving through a sea of vampires in the streets. They try to
escape to the library, but the undead follow them. As they try to fight them
off, a huge, horrific monster comes up through the floor and attacks them.
Buffy makes it back to the school and fights the Master on the roof. She
throws him through the roof window and he falls through, getting impaled on
the way down. He disintegrates, and the monster and the vampires disappear
with him. &quot;We saved the world. I say we party,&quot; exclaims Buffy.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

There's a dark cloud hanging over this episode which gives the proceedings a
different, quite sinister tone. It brings the first season to a very
satisfying conclusion even if many questions, in true cliff-hanger style,
remain unanswered. The episode showcases the acting abilities of its regular
cast members, and puts the characters in unusual scenes. Buffy's tense &quot;I
quit!&quot; moment revealing Buffy at her most insecure (&quot;Giles, I'm sixteen years
old. I don't want to die.&quot;), and Xander finally plucking up the courage to ask
Buffy for a date.<P>

Prophecy Girl is a very important episode, not least because it's the one
where Cordelia and Jenny Calendar are finally integrated into Buffy's circle of confidantes. (&quot;How
come she's in the club?&quot;, moans Willow). Paradoxically, it now seems that the
team is finally complete even though the episode contains several scenes where
their relationships seem to be crumbling away - Buffy rejecting Xander, Willow
rejecting Xander, Buffy rejecting her father figure, Giles. As cosy
preconceptions about the dynamics between the characters are shattered, the
sense of disintegration is almost palpable.<P>

Despite superficial appearances (those intentionally written into the script),
there's no sign that the show itself is tiring. Indeed, the special effects in
this episode are among the best the show has to offer and foreshadow even
greater things to come in the second season.<P>
