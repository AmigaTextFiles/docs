<P>
While Willow and Xander try to introduce Anya to the challenges of poker,
Maggie Walsh applauds Buffy's latest training exercise with the Initiative's
top agents. In less than a minute, Buffy manages to overcome Riley's squad
with nothing but her own two hands and feet.
<P>
At the cafeteria the next morning, Buffy and Willow tell each other about the
previous night. After Riley walks in, Willow makes sure that Buffy remembers
their planned get- together at the Bronze later that evening. Meanwhile, Giles
pays a visit to Spike's new home in the cemetery. Giles tries to motivate him
towards joining their cause, but the only thing that Spike is interested in is
the money that Giles owes him. Swearing off any future relations with the good
guys, Spike orders Giles to leave. Later, Riley accompanies Buffy on her first
trip into the Initiative laboratory beneath the surface of Sunnydale. Upon
stepping out of the elevator, Buffy marvels at the vastness of the facility.
Maggie Walsh greets them and escorts them to the central testing area, which
is called the Pit. Buffy notices an unfamiliar pair of demons that are being
observed by scientists, and Riley tells her about the difficulty of their
capture. By the armory, Maggie shows Buffy a communication camera headset
prototype that also reads the heart rate of whoever is wearing it. After the
tour, Maggie issues a pager to Buffy in order to alert her to any future
missions. Once the Slayer is gone, Maggie enters the restricted-access 314
lab, where Dr. Angleman is working on their secret project: a hideous
biological weapon that they are creating out of various demon body parts.
Named Adam, his completion is not too far away.
<P>
Meanwhile, Tara gives Willow a gift in the form of a rare Dolls-Eye crystal.
When Tara explains that it once belonged to her grandmother, Willow
respectfully turns down the offer. Tara then invites Willow to hang out at her
dorm room later that night. Having made prior engagements with Buffy and the
others, Willow regretfully turns down a disappointed Tara once again. At the
Bronze, Buffy arrives late with Riley, whose friends tag along. Willow wonders
if Buffy needs to slow things down and be more cautious, seeing how they still
know very little about the Initiative and how Ethan Rayne's 314 warning
factors into any of this. Before their conversation gets very far, the
incessant beeping of the pagers pulls Buffy, Riley, and the others out of the
Bronze and back to the laboratory. With Xander and Anya off on their own,
Willow heads over to Tara's dorm.
<P>
During the mission briefing, Maggie and Dr. Angleman explain the squad's
objective. They must capture a Polgara demon, which defends itself with bone
skewers that extend from its arms. Dr. Angleman makes it perfectly clear that
they must leave the demon's arms unharmed, which prompts a series of curious
questions from Buffy. Afterwards, Riley assigns Forrest and Graham to head the
Beta team, while Buffy accompanies him on the Alpha team. Out on patrol,
Graham spots Spike walking through the woods. Failing to capture him with a
net, Graham fires a tracking device into Spike's back as he makes his getaway.
Distracted by Forrest's call on the radio, the Polgara demon takes Riley by
surprise. Buffy rushes in to attack, while Riley and another agent ready their
tasers. A drop kick to the demon's chest by Buffy gives them the opening they
need, and soon the Polgara demon is stunned into submission. Stimulated by the
fight, Buffy and Riley spend the night together in bed, consummating their
relationship under the watchful eye of a hidden surveillance camera in the
ceiling of Riley's room. Unbeknownst to either Buffy or Riley, Maggie Walsh
sits in a secret room, watching their lovemaking on a monitor.
<P>
Pleased to wake up next to Riley in the morning, Buffy revels in her newfound
happiness. When Buffy asks Riley if he knows anything about 314, the ringing
of the telephone immediately breaks up their moment. Reporting in for duty,
Riley stops outside the restricted-access security door. Curious about what
Buffy said, he peers through the window and sees another door with the same
number inscribed on it. Interrupting Riley's investigation, Maggie orders him
to lead the Beta team in recapturing Spike. Once Riley leaves, Maggie informs
Dr. Angleman that Buffy is apparently aware of their secret experiment. While
Maggie prepares their back-up plan, Dr. Angleman completes the amputation of
the Polgara demon's left arm. On the surface, Spike retreats to Giles'
apartment for help. When Xander identifies the object in Spike's back as a
tracking device, they conclude that the Initiative will be on their doorstep
in no time. Meanwhile, Buffy returns to her room and finds that Willow's bed
hasn't been slept in. Willow arrives shortly, but another series of beeps from
Buffy's pager prevents the two from going into any detail regarding the events
of the previous night. After Buffy takes off, Willow gets a call from Giles,
who requests her assistance. At the apartment, Willow recites a spell that
ionizes the surrounding atmosphere, thus obscuring the tracer's signal. As
soon as Giles successfully removes the tracking device, Xander flushes it down
the toilet, bringing an abrupt end to Beta team's mission.
<P>
In the Initiative lab, Maggie briefs Buffy on a basic reconnaissance mission.
After notifying her of a possible hostile roaming the sewers, Maggie equips
Buffy with the com-cam prototype and a taser. Soon after beginning her
mission, Buffy detects the target heading towards her from up ahead. When two
axe-wielding demons step around the corner and confront Buffy, she immediately
recognizes them from the Pit at the Initiative laboratory.
<P>
Realizing that something is up, Buffy aims her taser and pulls the trigger.
Instead of firing an immobilizing bolt, the weapon short-circuits in Buffy's
hands, forcing her to drop it. In an instant, a steel gate drops behind Buffy,
sealing off her escape route. As Buffy engages the demons in hand-to-hand
combat, Maggie watches the struggle via the com-cam headset. During the
struggle, Buffy's headset is knocked off her head and falls to the ground. The
view from the camera, along with the terminated heart rate, leads Maggie
believe that Buffy has been successfully eliminated. Back in the sewers, Buffy
lures one of the demons into taking a careless swing with his axe. Buffy
dodges the weapon, which sinks into the chest of the other demon. With one
down and one to go, Buffy disarms her opponent, sending the axe into the
nearby water canal. However, the demon strikes back, knocking Buffy to the
ground before retrieving his axe. Noticing that the taser is still
short-circuiting, Buffy grabs the sabotaged weapon and throws it into the
canal. In seconds, the demon is electrocuted to death.
<P>
When Riley returns from his failed recovery mission, Maggie informs him that
Buffy is dead. Unable to comprehend what he's hearing, Riley is overwhelmed
with grief.
<P>
Suddenly, his eyes fall on the set of monitors behind Maggie, which show Buffy
adjusting the com-cam to a suitable angle. Maggie's act is cut short by the
sound of Buffy's voice, and she turns to hear the Slayer threaten her with
payback. Realizing his boss' deception, Riley leaves the premises, refusing to
acknowledge Maggie's orders to stop. Back at Giles' apartment, Spike vows to
stay in Sunnydale until something is done about the implant in his head. Buffy
arrives shortly afterwards, and she tells the others that the Initiative is
not what it seems.
<P>
Inside the 314 lab, a furious Maggie Walsh paces around the motionless body of
Adam. She declares her intent to get Riley back and get rid of the Slayer once
and for all. Suddenly, a sharp pain rips through Maggie's chest. When she
looks down, she recognizes the tip of a bone skewer protruding from her chest.
Moments away from death, Maggie slowly looks over her shoulder to see Adam
standing behind her. As Maggie drops to the floor, Adam looks down at her
now-lifeless body and affectionately says, &quot;Mommy.&quot;
