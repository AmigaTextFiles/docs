Oz is a senior student at Sunnydale who plays guitar in a band called Dingoes
Ate My Baby (a reference to the story of Lindy Chamberlain which was
dramatised in the 1988 Meryl Streep movie 'A Cry In The Dark'). The band often
plays at the Bronze, for example during the foreign exchange trip in
<A href=INCAMUMMYGIRL.html>Inca Mummy Girl</A>, and at the Valentine's Day dance in
<A href=BEWITCHED.html>Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered</A><P>

He first entered the orbit of Buffy and her friends when a mysterious computer
company picked him and Willow as potential employees, during the school's
career fair in <A href=WHATSMYLINE1.html>What's My Line - Part 1</A>. Willow and Oz became friends, their
relationship slowly becoming more intense (even though Willow still has some
feelings for Xander). Oz soon graduated to a fully-fledged member of Buffy's
team, often supplying transport as well as pithy  comments. After knocking
about with Buffy and Willow for a while, Oz discovered that, like several
members of his family, he is a werewolf! Every month, when there's a full moon
Oz has to be locked into a cage in the library, so that he can't harm himself,
or other people.
