<HR>
<P>
It's Oz's time of the month, which means he has to spend three consecutive
nights locked in the book cage of the library while someone watches over him.
After Xander comes in to relieve Willow of her post, he lies down on the table
and falls asleep. At the cemetery, Buffy patrols for vampires with Faith.
Neither of them are close enough to the woods to detect a chase, which ends
brutally for a boy named Jeff Orkin.<P>

The next morning, Buffy, Willow, and Oz meet up with Scott and two of his
friends: Pete and Debbie. Oz offers his old biology notes to Debbie, so they
plan to meet up later. Buffy then heads off for her required therapy
appointment with the counselor while Willow and Oz go to the library. To both
Oz and Willow's dismay, Giles and Xander inform them of the murder that
occurred the previous night. The fact that Xander slept through most of the
night and the window inside the caged area is open does not bode well for Oz.<P>

Meanwhile, Buffy meets her counselor, Mr. Platt. While she's hesitant to
discuss the full details of her reasons for running away, Buffy does come to
respect Mr. Platt's helpful manner. After school, Buffy meets the others in
the library and learns that Oz may have killed someone while he was a
werewolf. Giles tells Willow, Xander, and Cordelia to go to the morgue and
inspect Jeff's corpse, while Buffy must be on the look-out for the killer if
it isn't Oz. He'll have Faith watch over Oz that night. At the morgue, Willow
collects evidence which clearly indicates that Jeff was mauled by a savage
animal. She then passes out due to the realization that Oz is the most likely
suspect. Outside, Buffy encounters someone running wild through the woods. To
her surprise, that someone is Angel.<P>

However, he's not exactly in his right mind, and he immediately attacks Buffy.
They fight for a while before Buffy finally knocks him out. She then takes him
to Spike and Dru's mansion, where she uses some of Dru's old chains to lock
Angel up and keep him from escaping out into the woods. Unable to communicate
with Angel, Buffy notices the burnt pattern on the floor that indicates the
spot where Angel landed at the end of his return trip from Hell. Unable to
spend the rest of the night at home, Buffy goes to the library and takes over
for Faith.<P>

Giles finds Buffy asleep in one of the library chairs the next morning. He
notices the books she's been reading, which deal with demon dimensions and
Acathla. After Buffy wakes up, she asks Giles if Angel could ever return from
Hell, and if so, what would he be like. Buffy would rather not tell Giles
right away that she found Angel. While Giles doubts the possibilty of Angel's
return, he goes on to say that because time moves much faster in the other
dimension, Angel would have been trapped there for an incredibly long time.
After so many years of torture, he couldn't possibly be the same person
mentally that he once was. Later, at lunchtime, Buffy joins Scott, Pete, and
Debbie at their table. Unable to straighten out her feelings, Buffy leaves
shortly and goes to the mansion. As soon as she rests a hand on Angel's
shoulder, he goes berserk. Shaken by how much he's changed, Buffy heads back
to Sunnydale High. Inside, Buffy goes to Mr. Platt's office and confesses that
she truly needs help with all that's going on in her life. Unfortunately, she
won't get any help from Mr. Platt, whom she soon discovers has been murdered,
most likely by the same attacker that killed Jeff Orkin. <P>

After school, Pete pulls Debbie into the maintenance room to make out for a
while. Inside, he notices that a jar once containing a glowing green formula
is now virtually empty. Debbie tries to deny doing anything with it, but she
soon admits that she got rid of it in order to help Pete get better. However,
Pete convulses and transforms into a hideous, monstrous form of himself,
proving to Debbie that he doesn't need the formula anymore. During this phase,
Pete strikes Debbie in the face, knocking her to the ground. Pete then regains
control of himself and changes back to his normal self before joining Debbie
on the floor. Despite being struck by her boyfriend turned monster, Debbie has
no problem excusing Pete's actions. Afterwards, Debbie meets Oz by the
fountain to get his biology notes. Noticing the bruise on her eye, Oz stops
Debbie from leaving right away by lightly grabbing her shoulder and asking if
she's okay. From a distance, Pete watches this whole conversation.<P>

With evidence indicating that Mr. Platt was killed during the day, Oz is off
the hook. In the library, the group draws a connection between the two victims
and Debbie. Oz tells the others about Debbie's bruised eye, which doesn't
quite follow with the suddenness of Mr. Platt's death. This leads them to
suspect Pete, both for the two murders and for striking Debbie. While Oz locks
himself in the cage for the third and final night of the month, Buffy and
Willow confront Debbie. Unfortunately, Debbie refuses to help them stop Pete.
During the conversation, Angel breaks his chains free of the mansion wall and
escapes.<P>

Buffy and Willow have no idea that Pete is in the library at that very moment,
ready to kill Oz for touching Debbie. Pete changes into his monster form and
rips the door off the cage. After throwing Oz around the library for a little
while, the sun finally sets and the moon shines, allowing Oz to turn the
tables on Pete. In his werewolf form, Oz is an even match for Pete's ferocity.
The sounds of their battle alerts the others to the library. Buffy tries to
knock them out with the dart gun, but shoots Giles instead when Debbie pushes
the gun off to the side just as Buffy pulls the trigger. While the
tranquilizer dart takes Giles out of the action, Oz and Pete break apart and
escape into the school hallways. Willow and Faith take down Oz with the dart
gun. Buffy chases Pete to the maintenance room, where she finds Debbie dead on
the floor, murdered by Pete. Another fight ensues. Just as it appears that
Buffy's about to lose the fight, Angel arrives and kills Pete. To Buffy's
surprise, Angel manages to say her name before falling to his knees and
embracing her.<P>

The next day, Buffy can't find the words to console Scott, who lost two of his
best friends without ever knowing the truth about what really happened. Later
that night, Buffy watches Angel as he sleeps on the floor of the mansion. He
constantly flinches and trembles, apparently suffering from nightmares of his
time in Hell.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

What appears to be the series' latest examination of werewolf-lore evolves
into a rather ham-fisted interpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic
1886 novella 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. Of course the two
are quite closely related, but 'Beauty and the Beasts' lacks the core idea
that makes Stevenson's work so compelling (that Jekyll rather enjoys being the
bestial Hyde, before he eventually becomes irreversibly transformed).<P>

Instead the episode begins as a rather limp whodunit with Oz under suspicion
for a series of animalistic attacks. A great deal of time is wasted before the
real story kicks in, and the focus shifts to the more intriguing relationship
between Debbie and Pete. Unfortunately the rest of the episode is rather
rushed, and routinely plotted.<P>

If there is a message in Marti Noxon's script - perhaps Faith's assertion that
&quot;all men are beasts&quot; - it's trampled in the unseemly rush for the finale. Two
plot elements deserve to be singled out for special criticism: the awkward
scene where Buffy discovers that Platt - a promising character who could have
been built up for at least an episode or three - has been &quot;pureed&quot;, and
Angel's rapid recovery. And - like, hey! - just when did he put those trousers
on!? <P>

(I reckon it's Angel's little-known ability to regenerate his clothes...
remember when he jumped out of bed in <A href=SURPRISE.html>Surprise</A>, suddenly all dressed in
black?!)<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

Giles' suggestion that Angel may have been in Hell for hundreds of years -
given that time in that dimension moves at a different rate (see <A href=ANNE.html>Anne</A>) - now
makes precisely pinpointing Angel's age rather difficult.<P>

Pop Culture: Several movies are mentioned or quoted, including 'The Full
Monty' (Xander's &quot;I can handle the Oz Full Monty&quot;); 'The English Patient'
(Faith's &quot;Every guy from Manimal down to Mr. I-Love-The-English-Patient has
beast in him&quot;) and 'The Sound of Music' (Buffy's reference to its title song:
&quot;Three-dimensional, Sensurround, The Hills Are Alive...&quot;). Coincidentally all
of them were Academy Award winners, and all won Oscars for their music.
Sensurround was created by Universal in 1974, to give extra bass rumble to the
disaster epic 'Earthquake'. 'Manimal' was an awful TV series about a college
professor who could change into any type of animal. It ran for eight episodes
in 1983.<P>

Platt also at one point says to Buffy &quot;You're bringing me in at the end of the
movie here.&quot;<P>
