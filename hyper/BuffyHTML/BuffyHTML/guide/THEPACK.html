The students of Sunnydale High school are spending the afternoon at the zoo.
Besides the standard zoo animals, this facility has a special new hyena
exhibit, marked &quot;Positively No Admittance.&quot; This piques the interest of
Sunnydale's obnoxious cool crowd, who have already had their fun tormenting
Buffy and a shy, bookish student named Lance. After grabbing poor Lance's
notebook, they enter the forbidden hyena house, forcing him to follow. Xander,
worried about his timid classmate, decides to come to his rescue. As they wait
for Xander, Buffy and Willow meet an eccentric zookeeper, who claims the
hyenas can understand human speech -- they learn people's names, call out to
them, and then eat them. Meanwhile, the crowd in the hyena house starts to get
rough with Lance, but suddenly their eyes start flashing yellow -- apparently,
they've stepped into a mystical circle on the floor and a transformation has
taken place. We see the eyes of one student who never meant to be there, and
they're flashing yellow, too. It's Xander.<P>

Back at school, Principal Flutie proudly introduces the students to Herbert,
the Sunnydale Razorbacks' new mascot. Not quite as menacing as the team's
namesake, Herbert is a actually a little pig. Xander elicits a strange
reaction from Herbert when the two exchange a glance. Since returning from the
zoo trip, he is more confident, more aggressive, and generally not the same
old Xander. His love-sick puppy stares have turned to animal leers -- he has
even taken to sniffing Buffy.<P>

Willow brings the news to Buffy and Giles that Herbert is dead-- the
pint-sized porker has been eaten by the hyena-possessed students. Buffy tries
to confront Xander, but he becomes even more aggressive and pounces on her.
They scuffle for a while, but Buffy finally decks him, and locks him into a
steel book-return cage. When it is discovered that the pack is responsible for
Herbert's demise, Principal Flutie is up in arms. He summons the group to his
office to reprimand them, but doesn't get the chance.<P>

The news horrifies everyone -- Principle Flutie has been eaten! The &quot;official&quot;
story is that a pack of wild dogs did it, but Buffy, Willow and Giles know the
truth. Since Xander was with Buffy when the incident occurred, she is relieved
that he was not involved. Giles has figured out that in order to restore
order, the spirits of the hyenas must be taken from the students and put back
into the animals. While Buffy and Giles go to the zoo, Willow offers to watch
over Xander. The zookeeper, well-versed in these matters, offers to help with
the &quot;transformation,&quot; and says that all the students must return to the
mystical circle in the hyena cage. But one member of their pack is missing --
Xander -- and Buffy and Giles realize, to their horror, that they will seek
him out, leaving Willow vulnerable to their attack. When they do just that,
Xander breaks free from the cage, but Willow hides. They escape the school
grounds and Buffy leads them all to the zoo.<P>

While everything seems to be going according to schedule, it turns out that
the zookeeper's plan is to absorb all the hyena's spirits himself. He does,
and grabs Willow in order to perform a predatory act which is part of the
ritual. Xander, back to his old self, reacts to seeing his friend in jeopardy
and dives on the zookeeper, freeing Willow. When the zookeeper goes after
Buffy, she hurls him into the hyena cage, where he is promptly devoured.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

This is a highly inventive episode with an unusual premise, albeit one that is
somewhat difficult to believe. The supernatural elements are clumsily handled,
and the Primals ability to transfer their spirits into their human hosts are
not adequately explained. The ending seems rushed and muddled. It would have
been nice if the story could have been stretched to allow scenes where the
human hosts became even more animalistic but this would probably have
necessitated elaborate - and expensive - make-up, and might have earned the
episode an X-certificate. As it is, it comes pretty close to the knuckle
anyway, with scenes that must have sent the censors scurrying for their
rulebooks. The cannibalism element is not gratuitously exploited but it seems
likely that viewers will be rather more saddened by the death of Hubert the
pig than the demise of Principal Flutie.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>
Pop Culture: Buffy's line, &quot;I can't believe that you of all people are trying to Scully me!&quot; is a reference to Dana Scully, Agent Mulder's partner on 'The X-Files'. Scully is the most sceptical of the pair and was assigned to work with Mulder to keep his investigations grounded in reality.
