<P><B>Invisible Girl (AKA Out of Mind, Out of Sight)</B>

<P>
As the Spring Fling dance nears, Cordelia's new boyfriend is mysteriously
beaten up at school -- by a baseball bat with no one attached to it. The
attacker leaves a cryptic message on the locker, which leads Buffy to believe
it wasn't an ordinary monster. Giles suggests it might be an invisible
creature or a ghost.<P>

Another attack finds Cordelia's friend Harmony flying backwards down a flight
of stairs, with no apparent outside force. After hearing a girl's voice, Buffy
pursues the invisible attacker to no avail. Buffy enlists Willow's help in
trying to get a list of missing kids -- perhaps this invisible girl is one of
them. Meanwhile, Angel appears at the library and says he's worried about
Buffy -- he knows that something big is about to happen but he doesn't know
what.<P>

Shock of shocks -- Cordelia is elected the May Queen for the school dance.
Buffy is convinced Cordelia is the link between the two mysterious attacks.
She finds a girl in Willow's printout, Marcie Ross, who she thinks might be
the one. Marcie was in the band, and the invisible girl keeps hiding in the
ceiling above the band room. Buffy follows her there to find a nest of sorts
where the invisible girl has been hiding. Another attack occurs: Cordelia's
teacher is almost suffocated.<P>

Further investigation reveals that Marcie was in everyone's classes, but no
one seems to even remember that she existed. Giles says she simply became
invisible because she was perceived that way -- it's all due to physics,
helped along by living above a Hellmouth.<P>

Marcie's goal seems to be to destroy Cordelia, who is already wigged out by
the attacks on people close to her. Cordelia's coronation as May Queen that
evening would be the perfect place for Marcie to attack, but Cordelia is none
too thrilled about being used as bait. As Cordelia gets ready at school for
the dance, Marcie yanks her up through the ceiling. Meanwhile, Giles, Willow
and Xander hear some haunting music and try to follow it, hoping to find
Marcie. The trio is led to the boiler room where they are overcome by gas
fumes. Marcie anesthetizes both Buffy and Cordelia, brings them to the Bronze
and ties them up. Marcie, armed with an arsenal of creepy surgical
instruments, explains to Cordelia that she intends to give her a face no one
will ever forget. She slices Cordelia's cheek, but Buffy manages to free
herself and a scuffle ensues. Buffy finally knocks Marcie out, just as a pair
of FBI agents arrive to take Marcie away. Angel saves the unconscious gang in
the boiler room, but Giles tells Buffy it was a janitor -- he doesn't want to
remind Buffy of her lost love. Cordelia acts grateful to the gang, but becomes
her normal obnoxious self when her newly-healed boyfriend and her
cooler-than-thou friends show up.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

Ashley Gable and Thomas Swyden's clever script, based on a story by series
creator Joss Whedon, is jam-packed with clever dialogue, which other writers
would do well to use as a model. It also has a carefully-polished plot, which
makes good use of the theme of alienation. That said, it's not the most
original story, and it can be no coincidence that Willow is wearing a Scooby
Doo T-shirt is some scenes. All the series needs is a pooch and a van, and
Hanna-Barbera would be consulting their lawyers!<P>

This episode thrusts Cordelia into the spotlight, and Charisma Carpenter
proves to be more than up to the challenge. It's a pivotal episode for her
character, redefining her relationship with Buffy and the gang, and mellowing
her haughty attitude. After opening her heart to Buffy, Cordelia is
practically one of the Slayerettes by the end of the episode, even though
there is still some animosity. (&quot;Buffy, I know we've had our differences, with
you being so weird an' all, and hanging out with these total losers... I know
that you share this feeling that we have for each other, deep down.&quot;, blubbers
Cordelia. &quot;Nausea?!&quot;, suggests Willow.)<P>

It also brings a new dimension to Angel's relationship with Giles, as he
retrieves the book about Slayer lore that will play such an important part in
the series' finale. The explanation for Marcie's invisibility (the result of
people's indifference combined with energy from the Hellmouth) is particularly
inventive, and deftly bypasses the obvious potions and scientific
experiments.<P>
