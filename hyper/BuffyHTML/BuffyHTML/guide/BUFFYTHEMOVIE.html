!!!UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!<P>
Surprisingly few people know about the Buffy movie (released in 1992) and fewer have watched it so I've decided to write a synopsis for the film. Viewers hoping for one and a half hours of big-screen Sarah Michelle Gellar will be greatly dissappointed (Buffy is played by Kristy Swanson), and of course there's no Willow, Xander or Giles.

Joss Whedon wasn't happy with the way the film eventually turned out because it was so far removed from his original vision. Critics view the film as a major flop and it's screened only when Channel 5 run out of things to play for the 9 o'clock movie slot. So if you can't get hold of it (or would rather imagine Sarah doing Buffy's vamp-dusting deeds) here's the basic outline...
