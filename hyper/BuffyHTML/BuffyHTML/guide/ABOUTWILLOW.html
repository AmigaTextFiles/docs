<BR>(Alyson Hannigan)<P>
<HR>
<P>
Willow Rosenberg is a shy, but bright and highly intelligent student at
Sunnydale High. She is approached by Buffy, who needs some help with her
studies. Flattered that someone as relatively cool as Buffy wants to associate
with her, she eagerly agrees, and soon becomes the Slayerettes' resident
researcher. Her most valued skill is her ability to hunt down information on
the Internet, but she's equally at home delving into dusty books in Giles'
library.<P>

Willow has always had trouble establishing relationships with the opposite
sex. For a long time, she has had a crush on her best friend, Xander Harris,
but is too shy to tell him about it (they dated briefly when they were
children, but called it off when he stole her Barbie doll!). Her most notable
relationship began online, with &quot;Malcolm Black&quot;, but he later turned out to be
a fifteenth century demon trapped in cyberspace! Buffy gives her a shoulder to
cry on: &quot;The one boy that's really liked me, and he's a demon robot. What does
that say about me?&quot;<P>

An all-round nice person, Willow shows remarkable courage and fortitude when
the occasion demands. She has a well-developed sense of humour, but this only
comes out in front of people she's comfortable with.<P>

On &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; Alyson Hannigan plays a shy wallflower who
becomes Buffy's friend and confidante. In real life, Hannigan is a veteran
actress who has been performing since the age of four and recently garnered
rave notices for her break-out performance in the big-screen comedy &quot;American
Pie.&quot; <P>

Born in Washington, D.C., Hannigan moved with her family to Atlanta at age 2.
She began her career acting in commercials, working steadily in national spots
for accounts like McDonald's, Six Flags Amusement Parks and Oreo cookies. At
age 11, she moved to Los Angeles in hopes of breaking into film and
television. <P>

Her breakthrough role came when she was cast as Dan Aykroyd's misunderstood
daughter in the feature film &quot;My Stepmother Is An Alien.&quot; She also appeared in
the feature film comedy &quot;Dead Man on Campus,&quot; co-starring Tom Everett Scott
and Mark-Paul Gosselaar. <P>

She went on to guest-star on a number of popular television shows, including
&quot;Picket Fences,&quot; &quot;Roseanne&quot; and &quot;Touched By An Angel.&quot; She was a recurring
guest star on the series &quot;Almost Home&quot; and a series regular on &quot;Free Spirit.&quot;<P>
<P>

In her free time, Hannigan enjoys an active life, including playing soccer,
surfing the web, kickboxing, and devoting a great deal of time to her two dogs
and three cats. She currently resides in Los Angeles.
