On the night before Halloween, during a pumpkin-carving get-together at
Xander's place, Buffy leaves the gang a little early to spend some time alone.
Outside, Buffy knocks a demonic-looking figure to the ground. Still recovering
from Parker's rejection, she barely reacts to the realization that it was
merely a guy in his Halloween costume.<P>

At school the next day, the sight of Parker drives Buffy out of the cafeteria
just minutes into the lunch period. Willow tries to help out, but Buffy
prefers the easy way out. Her growing preoccupation does not go unnoticed by
Professor Walsh, who threatens to kick Buffy out of the class if she has any
more absences. Riley suggests to Buffy that she should take a break from her
worries and just have fun for Halloween. Meanwhile, Josh and Edward, two
members of the Alpha Delt fraternity, prepare their house for a haunted party.
While Josh puts the finishing touches on a knife-wielding skeleton, Edward
hands over a bag of fake spiders, as well as a book that contains an
appropriate symbol to add to the party's freaky ambience. When Josh complains
about their stereo system's quality, Edward offers to call Oz to remedy the
situation. After school, Oz brings his stereo over to the Alpha Delt house,
with Xander tagging along. As Oz sets up the new sound system, Xander notices
the symbol being painted on the floor of the attic by Chaz, another fraternity
member. Oz accidentally cuts his finger while trying to tweak the sound
quality by trimming the speaker wire. When he shakes some blood onto the
floor, the painted symbol sends a rippling shockwave throughout the house that
nobody notices. Suddenly, what was once a fake, plastic spider resting on the
floor is now a living, walking creature.<P>

Without a date of her own, Buffy feels left out as she accompanies the gang to
the party. After being swayed from patrolling by Giles, Buffy wears an old
Little Red Riding Hood costume, thanks to some last-minute alterations by
Joyce. Willow embodies the persona of Joan of Arc in her medieval garb, while
Oz completes the picture with his name tag reading &quot;God&quot;. Sporting a James
Bond-esque tuxedo, Xander tells the others that Anya, whom he invited earlier
that day, will be a little late on account of costume-finding difficulty. The
gang's stroll to the party is momentarily interrupted by the sudden appearance
of masked commandos armed with rifles. They quickly turn and run, leaving the
gang to mistake them for average Halloween celebrators. While Buffy and the
others make their way to the fraternity house, the guests at the party soon
realize that something is obviously not right. Bloody eyeballs, dead guests,
and other horrific sights send the partygoers into chaos. In a rush to get
away, Josh takes a fatal tumble down the main staircase, snapping his neck at
the bottom step.<P>

Moments later, Buffy, Xander, Willow, and Oz arrive. Real spiders and bats
that appear to be fake at first quickly alert the gang to the trouble that
lies ahead. Hidden inside a closet, they find Chaz huddled in the corner, too
scared to come out. While trying to get any information from Chaz, Buffy fails
to notice the skeleton that approaches from behind, the knife still in its
hand. A slash at Buffy's back sends her into automatic pilot, flooring the
enemy in one blow. Before it even hits the floor, the skeleton reverts to its
plastic state.<P>

After inspecting the attacker, Buffy realizes that the closet that Chaz was
hiding in is nowhere in sight. Having had enough, Buffy orders the others to
evacuate and get Giles for help. Willow disagrees, believing she can conjure a
guiding spell that will lead them to where they need to go. Their argument
splits the group in two, with Oz following Willow while Xander tries to
support Buffy. However, Xander soon realizes that he can no longer be seen or
heard by Buffy, who starts a search for her seemingly lost friend. Oz, in the
meantime, begins to transform into his wolf state, despite the fact that the
full moon is still weeks away. Unable to control himself, Oz lashes out at
Willow before running off to prevent any more harm.<P>

Outside, Anya finally arrives in a big, white bunny costume. Unable to find
the front door where it's supposed to be, Anya walks around the house and
spots a terrified guest screaming through one of the windows. As Anya looks
on, the window suddenly vanishes from the facade. She immediately seeks out
Giles, who goes through his books to find answers. After locating what he
needs, Anya returns to the house with Giles, who employs a chain saw to get
them inside. Meanwhile, Willow attempts the guiding spell. The appearance of a
tiny, green sprite leads Willow to believe she succeeded. However, the sprite
rapidly multiplies into an uncontrollable swarm that chases Willow from room
to room. Elsewhere, a door mysteriously lands Buffy in the basement, where she
finds herself restrained on the floor by the arms of zombies. As she struggles
to break free, Josh appears and taunts her mercilessly. When Buffy finally
escapes, she ends up in the attic, where the rest of the party guests shiver
in fear. She finds Oz, who has returned to his human state. Willow arrives
shortly, followed by Buffy's sighting of Xander in another corner of the
room.<P>

Back together, the gang tries to make sense of what's going on. Xander points
out the symbol on the floor, which Willow identifies as the Mark of Gachnar, a
fear demon. They conclude that their fears are being manifested so that
Gachnar can enter their reality. Suddenly, a buzzing chain saw marks Giles and
Anya's entrance into the attic. Giles produces the book he found on Gachnar,
which describes several ways of preventing the summoning. Halfway through
Giles' reading of a sentence involving the destruction of the symbol, Buffy
sends her fist through the Mark of Gachnar. Unfortunately, the rest of Giles'
reading informs Buffy that she has just brought forth Gachnar. A bright light
shines through the hole in the floor, and the gang watches as Gachnar
emerges... as a diminutive demon no taller than several inches. While
suppressing her own laughter, Buffy puts a quick end to Gachnar with one
stomp.<P>
<B>More Information</B>
<P>
This time around the set-up (a haunted house, and a costume party) provides a great backdrop to David Fury's inventive and fast-moving script. Viewers will be forgiven, though, for feeling a sense of déjà vu. Elements of 'Halloween' and, especially, season one's 'Nightmares', feel recycled.
<P>
Fury has said that 'Fear, Itself' is a companion piece to 'Nightmares', and that he decided not to directly revisit the fears that were portrayed in that episode. Having acknowledged that the gang had matured considerably in the two years since 'Nightmares', he felt that their fears would have changed accordingly.
<P>
<B>Trivia</B>
<P>
The title comes from American President Franklin D. Roosevelt's inaugural address, on March 4th, 1933: &quot;This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper... Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&quot;
<P>
Pop culture: Two movies are referred to at the beginning of the episode, for the gang's &quot;second annual Halloween screening&quot;: the 1979 horror film 'Phantasm' and the rather less terrifying 1940 Walt Disney animated showcase 'Fantasia'.
<P>
Giles' line about the Frankenstein monster puppet, &quot;It's alive!&quot;(a statement later echoed by Chaz), is a quote from the 1931 Boris Karloff version of 'Frankenstein'. This is what Victor Frankenstein (Colin Clive) cries as his creation begins to stir.
<P>
When Oz and Xander are checking the loudspeakers, Xander asks: &quot;You're sensing a disturbance in the force, master?&quot; This is another reference to the 'Star Wars' movies. (It's very close to a line in the first film, where Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) reacts to the destruction of the planet Alderaan: &quot;I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced&quot;).
