Sunnydale High computer teacher Jenny Calendar first encountered Buffy and the
gang when working on a project to digitally scan the books in Giles' library
in <A href=IROBOTYOU.html>I Robot...</A> When the process released a demon into cyberspace her knowledge
as a &quot;techno- pagan&quot; proved invaluable. She subsequently shocked and intrigued
Giles when he returned a lost &quot;earring&quot; to her - &quot;That's not where I dangle
it!&quot; - and a slow-burning relationship between them began to smoulder. She
became further integrated into the Slayer's circle when her contacts gave her
important information about the imminent resurrection of The Master.<P>

Jenny and Giles officially began dating in <A href=SOMEASSEMBLY.html>Some Assembly Required</A>, but only
because Jenny initiated events. In <A href=THEDARKAGE.html>The Dark Age</A> she was possessed by a demon
summoned by one of Giles' former acquaintances. The demon was exorcised, but
the event drove a wedge between Giles and Jenny, and their relationship cooled
considerably.<P>

In <A href=SURPRISE.html>Surprise</A> it is revealed that Jenny was sent to Sunnydale to spy on Angel.
She comes from a gypsy tribe, the Kalderash. Angel and Darla had attacked
their village, killing &quot;the most beloved daughter&quot; and &quot;every man, woman and
child that touched her life&quot;. The gypsies cursed Angel by restoring his soul,
ending Angelus' reign of terror. Jenny - or, more properly, Janna - is visited
by a tribe elder, her uncle, who insists that she destroys Angel's
relationship with Buffy, before he achieves one moment of happiness. However,
Angel sleeps with Buffy, the curse is lifted and Angel's soul disappears,
making him evil again. Angel kills Jenny's uncle, and Jenny's secret history -
and treachery - is revealed to the gang (in <A href=INNOCENCE.html>Innocence</A>). After a period of
being shunned by Giles and the gang, Jenny prepares to restore Angel's soul,
but the vampire is enjoying his new existence: he destroys her equipment, and
brutally kills her.
