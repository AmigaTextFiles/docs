Playing Xander's love interest on &quot;Buffy&quot; is not a stretch for the enchanting
Emma. She has been the object of affection on many television shows, ranging
from sitcoms (&quot;Weird Science&quot;), to dramas (&quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;), to soap operas
(&quot;General Hospital&quot;). <P>

After growing up in sunny San Diego, Emma moved into theater as a teenager.
Her experience landed her guest starring roles on television shows. She has
acted opposite heartthrobs Don Johnson on &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; and Lorenzo Lamas on
&quot;Renegade&quot;. Her favorite role, however, was as Nurse Penny Brady on &quot;Saved By
The Bell: The College Years&quot;. She enjoyed acting in front of the live studio
audience because it reminded her most of stage performance. <P>

Emma's breakthrough was her recurring character in the 1995-96 season of
Beverly Hills 90210 as Brandon's love interest, Susan Keats. This exposure
landed her the role of Anyanka, the patron saint of scorned women, on &quot;Buffy&quot;.
After losing her demonic powers, she has returned as the morally ambiguous
Anya, who becomes Xander's plucky girlfriend. <P>

While Emma loves working on &quot;Buffy&quot;, she has a cynical attitude towards her
career. &quot;I don't know that I want to act 15 years from now. I mean, I love the
process of acting, but not the masochism.&quot; Having already earned a degree in
Psychology, she won't have to worry about making a living fifteen years from
now no matter what her occupation.
