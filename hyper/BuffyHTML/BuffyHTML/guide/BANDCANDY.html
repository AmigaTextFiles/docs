<P><B>Band Candy</B>
<BR>3ABB06<P>
<HR>
<P>
Buffy's S.A.T. is coming up, so Giles helps her study for it at the cemetery
while waiting for any vampires to rise from their graves. At City Hall, Mayor
Wilkins enlists Mr. Trick's aid for an upcoming tribute to a demon. Mr. Trick
just so happens to know a man who can help them.<P>

The next morning, Principal Snyder enlists students to sell candy in order to
raise money for Sunnydale High's marching band, and Buffy and the gang are at
the top of Snyder's recruitment list. After Buffy convinces her mother to buy
some candy, she revives their long-standing debate over whether or not she can
get a license and start driving. Joyce remains uncomfortable with the notion
of her daughter behind a steering wheel. Buffy then heads off for the library,
telling her mother that she has some more training to do with Giles. Joyce is
not pleased with how much time Buffy has to spend working with Giles. At the
library, Buffy trains briefly with Giles before leaving early, explaining to
him that her mom wants her home early. Buffy then visits Angel at the mansion,
bringing along a container of blood from the butcher shop. When Buffy finally
goes home, she is surprised to find both her mom and her Watcher waiting for
her in the foyer. They both have figured out that Buffy lied to them in order
to go someplace else, although Joyce suspects that place was the Bronze.
Unhappy with the way she's being treated, Buffy expresses how she can't
fulfill both of their demands for the amount of time they want to spend with
her. After Buffy goes to her room, Giles and Joyce relax on the couch,
curiously eating one candy bar after another. Elsewhere, these same candy bars
are being packaged in a factory. Overlooking the whole process is none other
than Giles' old rival, Ethan Rayne.<P>

Buffy, Cordy, Xander, Willow, and several other students sit in study hall on
Friday, waiting for their supervisor to arrive. The staff member assigned to
study hall this day happens to be Giles, who is uncharacteristically late.
While the students wait, Xander and Willow engage in a forbidden game of
footsie under their table, apparently still hung up over each other after
their kiss on Homecoming week. Principal Snyder talks one of the teacher, Ms.
Barton, into filling in for Giles. Buffy is both surprised and dismayed to
learn that Giles never showed up, but she and the rest of the students are
even more surprised when Ms. Barton speaks to them loosely and freely, going
so far as to refer to their principal as &quot;Commandant Snyder&quot;.<P>

After school, Buffy goes to Giles' apartment to find out where he was, but
that soon becomes irrelevant when she notices that her mother is there as
well. Giles explains that he and Joyce have been working out a schedule to
make it easier for Buffy to spend enough time with the both of them. Joyce
then stuns her daughter by handing her the keys to her jeep, telling Buffy to
drive herself home. After Buffy grabs the keys and leaves, Giles lights up a
cigarette, dropping the charade that he and Joyce were putting on for Buffy
when she arrived just now. Not one to pass up on an opportunity like this,
Buffy picks up Willow in the jeep and drives off to the Bronze, displaying a
horrific driving ability along the way. At the Bronze, Buffy and Willow
immediately notice the vast number of adults present, which is unusual for any
given night at the Bronze. Even stranger is that all of the adults are acting
like rowdy teenagers, including Principal Snyder, who acts like he's just one
of the Scooby Gang. While Buffy and Willow try to decipher this phenomenon,
Giles and Joyce drink, smoke, and listen to old LP's before heading out into
town. Giles and Joyce stroll by the store windows, one of which showcases a
coat that catches Joyce's eye. Giles breaks into the window and steals the
coat for the new &quot;girl&quot; in his life. A cop tries to stop them, but Giles makes
short work of the cop and takes his gun before leaving the scene with Joyce.<P>

Back at the Bronze, Buffy decides that they need to get out and find some
answers. As Buffy, Willow, and Oz leave the Bronze and get into the jeep,
Snyder follows them into the car. Since time is definitely an issue, Buffy
lets him tag along. Meanwhile, adults all over town are acting like teenagers,
just like the people at the Bronze. Two guys even get into a drag race, and
one of them smashes into Buffy's jeep. After everyone gets out of the car, one
man runs by and steals Snyder's candy bar. Buffy realizes that there must be
something wrong with the candy. Buffy instructs Willow and Oz to get Xander
and Cordelia and head to the library, while she and Snyder drive to the candy
bar factory.<P>

Buffy and Snyder arrive at the factory, where a huge mob of adults are
gathered around the entrance to get more candy bars. On her way to the
entrance, Buffy is distracted by the sight of Giles kissing Joyce right in
front of her eyes. Unable to deal with them at this moment, Buffy knocks out
the workers and enters the factory, with Giles, Joyce, and Snyder following
closely behind. Inside, Buffy finds Ethan, who wastes no time in running away.
He tries to lose them in the maze of candy bar boxes, but Buffy eventually
finds him. Back at the library, the rest of the gang tries to find some useful
information, but they can't do much without a good lead. Buffy learns from
Ethan that his job was mainly to divert the adults from the main objective,
which is to pay tribute to a demon named Lurconis. Oz and Willow discover that
Lurconis feeds on babies.<P>

Unbeknownst to any of them, a group of vampires walk into the hospital nursery
and steal four of the infants there. Buffy and the others are too late in
getting to the hospital. However, Giles is able to recall that Lurconis means
&quot;glutton&quot;, and that they should be able to find him in the sewers. They go
down into the sewer tunnels and find the babies, along with Mr. Trick, the
other four vampires, and the Mayor. As soon as Buffy and Giles arrive, Mayor
Wilkinson immediately flees the scene. While Buffy fights the vampires, Giles
and Joyce move the babies out of harm's way. During the battle, Buffy throws
one of the vampires into a large pool. A large rumbling soon follows, and
Lurconis, a huge serpentine creature, emerges from an opening next to the pool
and devours the hapless vampire. Mr. Trick challenges the Slayer to a fight,
but her Watcher intervenes and attempts to take on the vampire. Mr. Trick
easily tosses Giles into the pool and escapes. With Lurconis coming back for
seconds, Buffy detaches a fuel line and ignites the open end on one of the
torches that the vampires set up, creating a giant blowtorch. As Lurconis
emerges from the opening once again, Buffy roasts the demon, sending it back
into its dwelling.<P>

Afterwards, Mayor Wilkinson expresses his disappointment in Mr. Trick's
failure, warning him not to make the same mistakes again.<P>

The following Monday morning, all the adults in Sunnydale are back to normal.
Buffy laments to Giles after school about the disaster that was her S.A.T.
They meet up with Joyce by the jeep, which is still wrecked. Buffy is relieved
that she was able to stop Giles and Joyce before they went a little too far
with their carefree romance... or so she believes.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B>
<P>
There's much to enjoy in this episode, from the terrific pre-credits scene in the cemetery ("I'm going with 'B' - we haven't had 'B' in forever") to the sly final exchange (Buffy's "At least I got to the two of you before you actually did something").<P>

'Band Candy' is an episode with really crackling dialogue and a strong, linear plot, probably the result of the appointment of new Executive Story Editor and this episode's writer - Jane Espenson, who can certainly be forgiven for a rather hackneyed core plot idea. The key storyline reintroduces Ethan Rayne, who has devised an overly elaborate plan to divert attention from his mission to steal infants from the hospital. It's a plot that develops steadily, subtly building hints that the adults are slowly regressing. The episode even finds room to develop the storyline involving the recovering Angel, who has recently been sidelined, and physically separated from the rest of the gang. The icing on the cake is a trio of terrific performances from Armin Shimerman, Anthony Stewart Head and Kristine Sutherland, all revealing aspects to their characters which have previously only been hinted at: Giles the tearaway, Joyce the flirt and Snyder the excitable nerd.<P>

<b>Trivia</B>
<P>
Pop Culture: This is an episode stuffed full of pop culture references, many of which will mean very little to British audiences. Buffy's exclamation "Let's do the time warp again!" when they enter the Bronze to find it full of aging adolescents refers to a line from the most infectious song in Richard O'Brien's horror-themed musical "Rocky Horror Show". (Anthony Stewart Head played the lead character, Doctor Frank N. Furter in a West End production of the show, so perhaps it wasn't entirely coincidental).<P>

Xander's question to the uncharacteristically cheery Snyder "You weren't visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past by any chance?" is, of course, a reference to Charles Dickens' 1843 novel "A Christmas Carol", in which the misanthropic Scrooge is reformed by four visiting spirits.<P>
