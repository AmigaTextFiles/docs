After hearing Cher's &quot;Believe&quot; for the umpteenth consecutive time, Buffy
decides it's time for her nightly patrol. She tells Kathy that she's going out
for a cup of coffee. Before Buffy can make it out of the room, Kathy mentions
that some of the milk in their fridge is missing. Buffy confesses and takes
off from Stevenson Hall. Outside, Buffy meets up with Willow, who listens to
her friend talk about the trials of living with a new roommate.<P>

While Buffy and Willow part ways, a demon with orange wrinkled skin and
glowing green eyes watches from behind the bushes. A sound nearby kicks Buffy
into alert mode, but she soon realizes that it's only Kathy, who has decided
to join Buffy for a drink. Suddenly, Buffy hears what is undoubtedly a growl.
She pushes Kathy out of the way just as a demon attacks her. Buffy fights
back, finally forcing the demon to retreat. As Buffy helps an unsuspecting
Kathy out of the bushes, the demon rejoins his partner. They believe that they
have finally found the one they've been after.<P>

The next day, Buffy visits Giles at his apartment. After she describes the
demon to Giles, he wonders why Buffy is there instead of at school. Buffy
admits that she's staying out of the dorm until Kathy goes to class.
Meanwhile, Kathy futilely attempts to remove the stains on her sweater from
the previous night. Giving up, she decides to take a look through Buffy's
closet. Kathy finds a sweater to her liking, then notices Buffy's weapons bag
on the floor of the closet. Later, Buffy cuts into the cafeteria line in an
attempt to avoid Kathy, who is standing further down the line. The student
whom Buffy cut off, Parker, decides to introduce himself. He gives Buffy a
lesson on how to effectively utilize their meal cards. At the end of the line,
Parker heads towards his friend's table, while Buffy joins Willow, Oz, and
Xander at the other end of the dining room. During their conversation, Kathy
takes it upon herself to join the group at their table, uninvited. Buffy
quickly recognizes what Kathy's wearing, who believes that it's only fair
since Buffy caused the stains on her own sweater. As Kathy tells the others
about herself, Buffy watches in horror as a glob of ketchup falls from Kathy's
hamburger onto the sweater.<P>

That night, Willow tries to talk on the telephone while her roommate throws a
party at the same time. On the other end of the line, Buffy throws out more
complaints about her roommate. Hearing Kathy just outside the door, Buffy
hangs up. While Kathy sits on the bed and flosses her teeth, Buffy tries to
fit her apple into the stuffed fridge, in which every item is labeled with
Kathy's name, including each individual egg. When Buffy turns around, she
realizes that Kathy has closed her window. Buffy opens it back up and hits the
sack. After falling asleep, Buffy has a dream about a demon placing a scorpion
on her stomach, pouring blood down her throat, and sucking a mysterious light
out of her mouth.<P>

In the morning, Buffy tells Giles and the others about her dream. Kathy
appears and tells them about a dream she had the previous night. While Giles
and the gang are shocked to hear a description of the exact same dream, Buffy
is more concerned with her growing irritation and hatred for Kathy. Later that
night, the two green-eyed demons stand before a fire and begin to summon
another named Tapparich. When Buffy returns to her dorm room, she finds Parker
talking to Kathy inside. Apparently, they have been talking and getting to
know each other for quite some time before Buffy walked in. After Parker
leaves, Buffy and Kathy face off once again. This time, Buffy decides to help
herself to as much of Kathy's carton of milk as she can handle. Elsewhere,
Willow worries about Buffy steady change in personality. Oz tells her that
he'll go find Buffy and see what's up. On his way to Buffy's patrol route, Oz
passes by a group of students. One of them, a short girl, draws Oz's attention
for a brief moment. As Oz looks back, the girl also does a double take with
Oz, sensing something. Figuring it's nothing, Oz continues forward, failing to
notice the army of rifle-carrying soldiers running towards the girl and her
friends. During the patrol, Buffy tries to put her hatred for Kathy into
words, but she only ends up destroying a park bench with a kick of pure
hatred. Before going to bed, Buffy tries to get some reading homework done.
However, Kathy's toenail clipping proves way more distracting than it should
be. In retaliation, Buffy starts tapping her pencil. What follows is Cher's
&quot;Believe&quot;, Buffy's earmuffs, and the torturous crunching of Kathy's
hard-boiled egg shell. Having had enough, Buffy goes to bed and has the same
nightmare she had the previous night.<P>

Buffy wakes up the next morning to see Kathy squirming in her bed, apparently
having the same dream. Later, Willow talks to Kathy in the dorm hallway about
Buffy. Seeing Buffy approaching, Kathy takes off. Willow then listens in
fearful concern as Buffy declares that Kathy is evil and must be killed. Buffy
tries to explain that she took a sample of Kathy's toenail clippings and
realized that they continued to grow by themselves. However, Willow has
already concluded that her friend has gone off the deep end. Willow tells her
to talk to Giles, then calls him up to warn him of Buffy's arrival. Buffy
enters Giles' apartment and is greeted by a falling net from above. Giles,
Xander, and Oz rush out to restrain Buffy with ropes, fearing that her murder
plan must be stopped at all costs. Buffy leads Giles to the toenail clippings
in her bag and tries to convince them that she's right.<P>

However, Giles believes that Buffy has been possessed by the demon she fought
in the woods. While Xander and Oz take positions as watch guards over the
restrained Slayer, Willow tries to warn Kathy about Buffy's intentions.
Kathy's response of Buffy's come- uppance only scares Willow more, and she
leaves shortly after getting a call from Oz. Back at the apartment, Buffy
frees herself from the ropes and tricks Xander and Oz into coming close enough
for her to knock them out.<P>

Buffy returns to the dorm room in hopes of finishing Kathy once and for all.
When Kathy lands a hard backhand against her roommate's face, Buffy grabs her
by the face and pulls with all her might. The human skin comes off, revealing
the same kind of demon that Buffy encountered several nights ago. While they
battle, Xander and Oz regain consciousness just as Willow arrives at the
apartment. Back at the dorm, Kathy informs Buffy that she escaped from another
dimension, and now her elders have followed her in hopes of bringing her back.
The only way they can recognize one of their own is by sensing the absence of
a soul, so Kathy has been sucking out Buffy's soul the past few nights. Giles
learns of this Ritual of Mok'tagar through research and quickly checks the
toenail clippings. Confirming their continuing growth, Giles goes out into the
living room to tell Willow, Xander, and Oz what he has learned. Since Buffy
has already escaped, Giles decides that he and Willow must perform a spell
that will reverse the effects of the ritual. While Xander and Oz head towards
the dorm, Buffy and Kathy tear up their room in the name of beating the crap
out of each other. Just as Kathy attempts to finish her assimilation of
Buffy's soul, Giles and Willow complete the spell. Buffy's soul leaves Kathy
and returns to its original host. Suddenly, the demon Tapparich appears in
their dorm room. Kathy tries to plead her case, but Tapparich has heard
enough. He opens a portal that sucks Kathy and himself back into their own
dimension.<P>

Now that Kathy is officially no longer a student at UC-Sunnydale, Willow
decides to leave her party-crazed roommate and move in with Buffy. Things are
finally looking up, although a forbidden bite from Buffy's sandwich drives the
Slayer to focus her evil eye on Willow.<P>

Episode Synopsis by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B>
<P>
Films like 'Fatal Attraction', 'Pacific Heights' and 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle' helped popularise a sub-genre of thrillers featuring seemingly normal characters that turned into raving psychopaths. These were often referred to as the '...from Hell' movies (as in 'the mistress from Hell', 'the tenant from Hell', etc).
<P>
Now, with 'Living Conditions', writer Marti Noxon has taken the concept to its logical conclusion: having the character in question actually be a demon from another dimension! Dagney Kerr's nicely paced performance as Kathy helps sell the premise, but the story needed much longer to unfold, forcing Noxon to use many shortcuts to convey Buffy's creeping sense of paranoia. The result is a story with a rushed ending, short on subtlety and sorely lacking the wonderful dialogue nuances that characterise most episodes of the show.
<P>
It's encouraging to find the regular cast so casually back together again after the worrying indications in the last episode that it would be difficult for the writers to find reasonable excuses for them to continue working as a team. This episode generally dispenses with explanations, and flows better because of it.
<P>
<B>Trivia</B>
<P>
Pop culture #1: The scene where Oz and Xander discuss Buffy's flirty encounter with Parker contains several references to the two 'Terminator' movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. These include allusions to famous quotes from the films, including &quot;hasta la vista, baby&quot; and the ominous promise &quot;I'll be back&quot;.
<P>
Pop culture #2: For a more measured approach to the 'roommate from Hell' story check out Barbet Schroeder's 1992 film 'Single White Female', starring Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh.
