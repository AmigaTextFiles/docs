Sunnydale Cemetery. Evening. A body once known as Andrew Hoelich rises from
its grave, ready for a new life as a creature of the night. Standing in his
way is not the Slayer, but rather her closest friends: Willow, Xander, and Oz.
Unfortunately, without the powers that make Buffy special, the three friends
are unable to kill the vampire before it can escape into the night.
Afterwards, the group prepares themselves for the new school season, which
begins the very next day. They also wonder if and when Buffy will return to
Sunnydale after her unannounced absence since saving the world from the
Acathla threat. What they don't know is that Buffy is currently living alone
in an apartment in downtown Los Angeles. Buffy's dreams are haunted by Angel,
reminding of her of what she had to do in order to stop Acathla.<P>

The next morning, Willow learns that Oz flunked his senior year and needs to
repeat it, Xander and Cordelia's anticipated reunion has no sparks whatsoever,
and Giles gets the latest in a long line of leads concerning Buffy's possible
location. Meanwhile, Buffy is working as a waitress in a diner, under the
alias of Anne. During work, she serves a romantic couple of runaways. The
girl's name is Lily, while the guy's is Rickie. They both have each other's
name tattooed to their forearms. When Lily recognizes the waitress, Buffy
denies any familiarity with the girl. At one point, Rickie says to Lily the
exact same words that Buffy heard from Angel in one of her dreams. The next
day, on the way to work, Buffy passes by an old homeless woman who repeatedly
says, &quot;I'm no one.&quot; Back in Sunnydale, Giles pays Joyce Summers a visit to
inform her that his latest search turned up empty-handed. Joyce expresses her
resentment toward Giles, blaming him for Buffy's distance from her own
mother.<P>

On her way home from work, Buffy runs into Lily again. Lily gets Buffy's
attention by calling her by her real name, then reminds Buffy that she once
went by the name of Chantarelle and was involved in a vampire-worshipping
cult. Buffy explains that Anne is really her middle name. During their
conversation, an old man rudely bumps the both of them aside as he walks
towards the street. When asked if he's okay, the old man turns to them and
says, &quot;I'm no one.&quot; With that, he walks into the middle of the street, then
stops in the path of an oncoming car. Buffy dashes into the street and pushes
him aside just in time, but not before the car collides and sends her slamming
into the pavement. A few locals offer to help her and call an ambulance, but
Buffy quickly leaves the scene without even a limp. On the way, Buffy meets a
relatively clean-cut man. His name is Ken, and he's handing out flyers for a
shelter called the Family Home. Meanwhile, in the Bronze, Xander chats with
Willow and Oz about their failure at vampire slaying. Seeing Cordelia enter
the Bronze with a few of her friends, Xander hatches a plan to use her as
bait.<P>

The next day, Lily visits Buffy at work and tells her that Rickie's been
missing for a while. Buffy reluctantly agrees to help, and they first visit
the local blood bank where Lily and Rickie often donated in order to make some
money. According to the doctor, Rickie hasn't been there in the last few days,
so Buffy and Lily agree to split up and meet up later at Buffy's apartment.
During a search in an abandoned building, Buffy finds a dead old man with a
bottle of Drain Cleaner next to his head. Since the bottle is empty, the old
man must have killed himself with it. However, that's not the most disturbing
thing: Buffy notices a familiar tattoo on the man's forearm. It says &quot;Lily&quot;,
which means that this dead old man was Rickie. Back at her apartment, Lily
cannot believe the news. She blames Buffy for bringing along some evil from
Sunnydale, causing her boyfriend's untimely death. Lily exits the apartment
and meets Ken, who tells her that Rickie is alive and staying at the Family
Home. Relieved, Lily follows Ken to the shelter. Determined to get to the
bottom of things, Buffy breaks into the blood bank after closing hours and
finds Rickie's personal file. Alarmed by the word &quot;Candidate&quot; stamped in it,
Buffy questions the doctor, who has just arrived on the scene. Buffy gets the
info that leads her to the Family Home, where she finds Lily alone with Ken in
a room. Before Buffy can find out what's going on, Lily is pulled into the
floor through a strange black pool. Buffy struggles with Ken before they both
fall into the pool. On the other side of it, they crash down hard on the
floor. While Buffy takes care of Lily, Ken removes his mask to reveal the face
of a demon underneath. He calls the guards, and Buffy grabs Lily and tries to
escape. As the guards give chase, Buffy and Lily run into an enormous factory
room. Hundreds of missing runaways work slave labor, while the demonic guards
watch them, whips in hand. Ken and the guards catch up to them. With a swift
swing of his club, Ken knocks Buffy unconscious.<P>

Back in Sunnydale, Xander, Willow, and Oz try to dust the vampire again, this
time with Cordelia as bait. While everyone assumes their hiding positions,
Xander and Cordelia argue over what they did or didn't do during the summer.
Their fight is interrupted by a scream, for the vamp has snuck up behind
Willow and attacked her first. Oz runs in to the rescue, but the vamp quickly
knocks him to the ground. Xander tries to drive his stake into the vampire's
chest, but they get their arms locked up, preventing Xander from thrusting the
stake any further. Cordelia charges the vampire from behind, and all three of
them fall to the ground. The vampire lands into the stake, and immediately
explodes into dust. This causes Cordelia to fall into Xander's arms. They
finally give in to their desires and kiss right then and there.<P>

Buffy regains consciousness inside a prison cell. Lily, who's sitting inside
the same cell, believes they're in Hell. Buffy denies this, but that becomes
irrelevant as Ken explains their situation. Apparently, they are in some
alternate dimension outside of Earth, and time passes differently here.
According to Ken, one day on Earth equals one hundred years in this dimension.
Buffy puts the pieces together and realizes that the disoriented old people
she saw on the street must have been former slaves in this dimension,
including Rickie. Buffy, Lily, and several other runaways are then led into a
room. A demon guard tells them that they no longer have any individual
identities. He then asks a boy to identify himself. When the boy responds with
his own name, the guard beats him with a club. Lily's next, and her answer is
&quot;no one&quot;. A few more slaves respond in the same manner. The guard then asks
Buffy. Instead of giving the expected answer, Buffy finally comes to terms
with who she is and responds with her true identity, that of the Slayer. With
that, Buffy proceeds to fight and subdue the guards in the room. After telling
Lily to lead the others to the exit, Buffy runs out into the middle of the
factory and battles an endless number of demon guards. One after the other,
Buffy defeats them, until Ken grabs Lily and threatens to slice her throat
with a knife for Buffy's disobedience. Surprisingly, Lily pushes Ken off the
balcony while his back is turned, enabling Buffy to fight off the guards
holding her and climb to safety. At the exit, they encounter a heavy gate
which Buffy uses all of her strength to lift. Just as she's about to escape
herself, Ken tackles her. As he does so, Buffy is knocked towards the outside
of the gate, which comes crashing down on Ken's legs. Buffy then takes Ken's
club and smashes it onto his skull. After Buffy, Lily, and the other runaways
climb through the black pool, it seals itself.<P>

Deciding it's time to go back home, Buffy gives her apartment and her job to
Lily. Buffy is confident that Lily can take care of herself from now on.
Before Buffy leaves, Lily asks her if she can use Buffy's middle name, Anne,
as her own. Buffy agrees and leaves. Back in Sunnydale, Buffy knocks on the
door to her home. After Joyce opens it, they stand there, completely
speechless. Finally, they embrace. For Giles and the rest of the Sunnydale,
the Slayer has returned. For Joyce Summers, someone more important is finally
home: her only daughter.<P>

Episode Summary by: Alan Hufana<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

If season two started with an episode that made it seem like the programme had
been completely revitalised by the break, then the third season begins with an
episode still deeply rooted in the somewhat depressing finale to the previous
episode. More than five months have passed between the climactic end of
<A href=BECOMING2.html>Becoming - Part Two</A> and our return to Sunnydale in 'Anne', and the stagnation
caused by Buffy's departure is acutely felt. Willow, Oz and Xander seem
woefully ill- equipped to tackle the town s vampire population and must have
been lucky to survive the summer break!<P>

For some time it feels like Joss has completely forgotten how the series
works. Buffy's self-imposed exile has upset the careful balance that usually
exists within the team. What's more, Cordelia's awkward reintroduction after
her Mexican holiday artificially distances her from the rest of the gang. It
creates another impediment to returning to the status quo.<P>

One element of the episode that does work very well is the gradual shift in
Buffy's spirits. We first encounter her working anonymously in a diner, her
mental scars far from healed. Her reawakening is gradual, spurred on by her
empathy for the waifs and strays sleeping rough on the streets of the city.
Between Sarah's acting, and Joss's script and direction it s beautifully
depicted. Her eventual realisation that she must return to Sunnydale ends the
general atmosphere of malaise. If there was any doubt that the show was
veering off the rails, it is dispelled by Buffy's defiant message: &quot;I'm Buffy.
The Vampire Slayer, and you are?!&quot;<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

The new season sports a new, updated title sequence, and a slightly different
arrangement of Nerf Herder's theme music. The final shot of the new sequence,
a moody close-up of Buffy holding a sickle-like axe, comes from this episode.
The new titles include credit for Seth Green, who is promoted to a regular
cast member from this episode.<P>

Several cast members featured in previous episodes return here, including
Larry Bagby III as Larry, (the jock that Xander outed in <A href=PHASES.html>Phases</A>. Also notable
is the return of Chanterelle, the vampire wannabe from <A href=LIETOME.html>Lie To Me</A>, here
reincarnated as 'Lily'.<P>

Ken is played by Carlos Jacott, who has also appeared in the hit TV sitcom
'Frasier' as Matt, the producer of a morning TV show that Frasier presents for a week.
Confusingly, he later appears in an episode of 'Angel' as a completely different demon.<P>

We discover that Buffy's middle name is Anne, a fact curiously omitted from
her tombstone, which appeared in <A href=NIGHTMARES.html>Nightmares</A>.<P>
