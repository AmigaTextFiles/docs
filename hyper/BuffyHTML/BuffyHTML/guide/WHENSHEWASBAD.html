After spending the summer with her dad in L.A., Buffy returns to Sunnydale,
well, very unsunny. It seems her prom night massacre of the Master -- during
which she died and came back to life -- gave her more of a wiggins than she
admitted at the time. And to make matters worse, the Master is not quite as
dead as everyone had hoped. His minions assemble with the Anointed One and
plan to try to bring the Master back. This can be done by assembling those who
were with him when he died -- Willow, Cordelia, Giles, and Ms. Calendar, the
computer teacher who Giles is stuck on. Angel warns Buffy about the Anointed
One's powers, but she ignores him. Besides being rude to Angel and nasty to
Cordelia, she is cold to Willow and Xander. She even tries to make Angel
jealous by dancing seductively with poor Xander, who buys her act. Xander
finally tells Buffy off when the vampires beat him up and start assembling the
foursome they need for their mission. Buffy rescues Willow, Cordelia, Giles
and Ms. Calendar, who are hung upside down and about to be killed. In order to
finish off the Master, Buffy crushes his bones.<P>

After this final act, Buffy is purged of her fear and anger and starts sobbing
as Angel holds her. The next day at school, she apologizes to Giles for
behaving so badly, and is mortified when she realizes how rotten she's been to
her friends. But once she gets to class, Xander and Willow are quick to
forgive her, and the Three Musketeers -- or is it the Three Stooges? -- are
together again.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

Following the Summer break, and her dramatic encounter with The Master, Buffy
returns to Sunnydale. Likewise, the show returned to American screens, looking
revitalised and exhibiting a new-found confidence. 'When She Was Bad' is
another excellent episode written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon.
It begins by showing that the events at the end of the last series had
long-lasting consequences (see <A href=PROPHECYGIRL.html>Prophecy Girl</A>). This is a style that's becoming
increasingly rare in television drama, which normally tends to live in the
moment and assumes that viewers are too fickle to follow plot threads across
more than one episode.<P>

The episode does a good job tying up the loose ends left at the end of the
first series and toys with the viewer's expectations that The Master might not
really be dead. In fact, it's Buffy that might not really be alive or, at
least, not fully recovered. Before long, though, it becomes obvious that she's
back to fighting fitness, and by the end of the episode, Buffy has exorcised
her remaining demons. Sarah Michelle Gellar handles the changing moods of her
character very skilfully, bringing added depth to confrontational scenes with
Cordelia, Angel and Xander.<P>

Cordelia is finally integrated into Buffy's club of confidantes during &quot;When
She Was Bad&quot;. This changes the dynamic relationship between the lead
characters - keeping the show fresh and giving the talented Charisma Carpenter
new nuances to work with.<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

Being the first episode of the second series, 'When She Was Bad' features a
revamped title sequence, with added credit for David Boreanaz (Angel). Since
the second season was shot six months after filming wrapped on the first,
several cast members have different hairstyles. (In Sunnydale at least several
weeks have passed since the events in <A href=PROPHECYGIRL.html>Prophecy Girl</A> so it makes sense that
there would be differences).<P>
