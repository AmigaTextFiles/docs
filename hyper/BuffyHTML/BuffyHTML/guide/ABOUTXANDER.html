Alexander LaVelle Harris, known universally as &quot;Xander&quot;, is a bright student
at Sunnydale High, but lacks application.<P>

Xander has been close friends with Willow for most of their lives. He doesn't
realise that she is smitten with him and, in any case, he is besotted with
Buffy. Theirs is a doomed romance, since there's only one man in Buffy's life:
Angel. Xander finally plucked up the courage to tell Buffy of his feelings (in
<A href=PROPHECYGIRL.html>Prophecy Girl</A>) only to find that they were not reciprocated. Nevertheless, he
remains fiercely loyal and protective, even though often it places him in
danger. Their adventures together have tested Xander severely. Xander has
matured considerably since meeting Buffy, and has grown in courage. Little of
Xander's home life has been revealed. Like Willow and Buffy he's an only
child, but one who isn't close to his parents.<P>

Xander has not had many romantic relationships, (and is seemingly oblivious to
Willow's charms), and most of them have ended badly, (his entanglement with
Natalie French in <A href=TEACHERSPET.html>Teacher's Pet</A>, for example). Following a long period of
mutual animosity Xander and Cordelia were chased into a basement by one of the
three assassins from the Order of Taraka (in <A href=WHATSMYLINE2.html>What's My Line? - Part 2</A>). There
long-suppressed passions boiled over, marking the beginning of what's sure to
be a sparky relationship.<P>

Nicholas, who portrays the sardonic Xander with sensitivity and humor, already
has a varied list of credits in television, film and theater. With his
aspiration of playing professional baseball squashed when an arm injury cut
his sports career short, Brendon tuned to the acting game for a new challenge.
Soon after, he made his television debut in a Clearasil commercial. <P>

He persevered in entertainment and switched to the other side of the camera,
working as a television production assistant on &quot;Dave's World.&quot; After he
landed a guest-starring role on the series, Brendon continued to pursue his
dream of becoming an actor. Fate soon smiled upon him and he was called to
audition for the role in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; <P>

In television, he had a recurring role on the daytime drama &quot;The Young and the
Restless,&quot; guest-starred on the popular primetime comedy series &quot;Married With
Children,&quot; and starred in the pilot &quot;Secret Lives.&quot; He played an evil corn
follower in the feature film &quot;Children of the Corn III ­ Urban Harvest,&quot; and
starred in Los Angeles theater productions of &quot;The Further Adventures of Tom
Sawyer&quot; at Theatre West, &quot;My Own Private Hollywood&quot; at The Black Hole Theatre
and &quot;Out of Gas on Lovers' Leap&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse. <P>

Offscreen, the Los Angeles native enjoys playing basketball, camping and
spending quality time with friends and family, including his identical twin
brother, Kelly.
