<B>Principal Snyder</B>
<BR>(Armin Shimerman)<P>
<HR>
<P>
Principal Snyder was appointed to Sunnydale High School after the premature
death of Principal Flutie in <A href=THEPACK.html>The Pack</A>. His arrival in <A href=PUPPETSHOW.html>The Puppet Show</A> brought
a new tough regime to the school, and more trouble for Buffy and the gang: &quot;My
predecessor Mr Flutie may have gone in for all that touchy-feely relating
nonsense, but he was eaten. You're in my world now!&quot;<P>

Armin Shimerman was born in Lakewood, New Jersey, on November 5th 1949. He
planned on becoming a lawyer, before being bitten by the acting bug. After
learning his craft during several years playing New York theatre he migrated
to the West coast, and started appearing in various TV series and movies.
Shimerman came to the attention TV fantasy fans as Pascal in the popular
1987-1990 series 'Beauty and the Beast', but he's better known as Quark, the
Ferengi bar owner in 'Star Trek - Deep Space Nine', hidden behind an extensive
prosthetic makeup that made him the show's least recognisable, but perhaps
best-loved, star. Shimerman appeared in two episodes of 'Star Trek: The Next
Generation', including the 1987 episode that introduced the Ferengi, before
being cast as a regular on 'Deep Space Nine'.<P>

'Star Trek - Deep Space Nine' ended its seven-season run earlier this year,
meaning that some of the time Armin was working on 'Buffy' he was also
starring in 'Star Trek'. This was a logistical challenge for the producers of
both series, and meant long days for Armin, who would start 'Star Trek' very
early in the morning, (so that his makeup could be applied), drive across
state over lunch, and shoot 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' in the afternoon!<P>

He originally auditioned for the role of Principal Flutie, (the one who was
eaten by the wolf creatures in <A href=THEPACK.html>The Pack</A>), but eventually ended up as his
replacement, the menacing Principal Snyder. Armin's other genre roles include
appearances in 'Alien Nation' and 'Stargate SG1'. He's also appeared in
'Seinfeld', and as a judge in two David E. Kelley series: 'The Practice' and
'Ally McBeal'.
