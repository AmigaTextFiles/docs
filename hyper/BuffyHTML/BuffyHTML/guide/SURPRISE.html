Buffy's nightmare about Drusilla killing Angel gives her a major wiggins. She
tells Angel about it, afraid that Drusilla might still be alive, but he thinks
there's nothing to worry about. They kiss a lot. That morning at school, Buffy
is all swoony about Angel, and Willow encourages her to move their
relationship to the next level. Willow works up the nerve to talk to Oz, the
guitar-playing cybernerd who's been mooning over her, and he asks her out for
the following night -- where he'll be her date for Buffy's surprise 17th
birthday bash. When Buffy tells Giles and Jenny Calendar about her dream,
Giles says it's possible that Drusilla is alive, and to be on alert. Sure
enough, we see Spike and Dru at the factory. Spike is scarred and in a
wheelchair but as evil as ever. Dru is planning a party, too, but it's a safe
bet there'll be no chips and dip at this one.<P>

A strange man approaches Jenny in class -- it is her uncle, and we discover
she is actually a gypsy whose entire family was killed by Angel when he was
the superevil Angelus. The uncle says it's not fair for Angel to have any
happiness, so it's Jenny's duty to keep Buffy away from him. Jenny offers to
take Buffy to meet Giles off campus, and they discover some vamps making
trouble -- one of whom is the transcriber who once worked for Spike.<P>

As Buffy and one of the vamps scuffle, they go flying through the window of
the Bronze where the surprise party awaits. Newcomer Oz is startled to see
Buffy slay one of them, and now he's officially part of the gang. They open
the box the vamps were carrying, and it contains an arm which reaches out and
chokes Buffy. Angel explains there was a creature called The Judge who
destroyed everyone who was righteous. He was finally dismembered by an army,
but his parts still exist, and reassembling him would bring on Armageddon.
Angel says he must take that arm to the other side of the world, and must
leave by boat immediately. Buffy joins him at the dock to say goodbye, and he
gives her a claddagh ring as a token of his love. As they say goodbye, the
vamps are back and the arm is stolen.<P>

Dru's party is in full swing, and The Judge is the main attraction. His first
conquest is the transcriber, who he ignites with just a touch. When Buffy and
Angel go to the factory to see if they can find any more parts, they see it's
too late, and The Judge spots them. They escape to Angel's pad, where he
finally tells her he loves her. They make love and go to sleep. An undressed
Angel awakens with a start and runs outside, suddenly fully dressed in black,
and collapses. He calls Buffy's name but she stays asleep... <A href="INNOCENCE.html">[to be continued...]</A><P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

After the nightmares that the return of the Master caused Buffy in
<A href=WHENSHEWASBAD.html>When She Was Bad</A> you'd think that the Slayer and her buddies would have made
more effort to ensure that Drusilla was really dead (at the end of
<A href=WHATSMYLINE2.html>What's My Line</A>), especially when, from that episode's closing scene, she
wouldn't have been too difficult to find! Never mind, this episode sees the
welcome return of Drusilla and Spike, who, heavily scarred, is now confined to
a wheelchair.<P>

The gradual shift towards turning the series into a romantic soap opera,
perhaps in an attempt to broaden its demographic appeal to more female
viewers, is halted in its tracks with this terrific episode, which re-writes
the 'Buffy' rulebook. Buffy and Angel have finally done the dirty deed, and
now they're going to pay for it. The two-part stories have traditionally
tackled important events, and this is no exception. Marti Noxon's first solo
script is a perfect example of good writing, and is replete with sharp
dialogue and meaningful character development. Director Michael Lange (who has
also helmed episodes of 'The X-Files' and 'American Gothic') handles every
aspect of the production perfectly; getting perky performances from his cast,
and creating contrasting moments of genuine tension and cosy intimacy.<P>

Oz becomes a fully in-the-know member of the Scooby gang in this episode,
graduating with his cool reaction to the news that vampires are real, and that
a lot of them live in Sunnydale: &quot;Actually, it explains a lot!&quot;<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

This is the episode where Angel gives Buffy the claddagh ring. It's also the
source of the clip in the third season's title sequence with Willow and the
monkey.<P>

Willow and Oz officially start dating, after she invites him to Buffy's
birthday party. Brian Thompson, who appeared as the Master's servant, Luke, in
the <A href=WELCOMETOHELLMOUTH.html>Welcome To...</A> and <A href=THEHARVEST.html>The Harvest</A> returns as The Judge.<P>

'Surprise' reveals Jenny Calendar's true reason for being in Sunnydale, and
introduces her gypsy uncle, played by unforgettable character actor Vincent
Schiavelli, whose lengthy list of credits include appearances in 'Tomorrow
Never Dies' as an urbane torturer, the subway ghost in 'Ghost' and as
Salieri's valet in 'Amadeus'.<P>

Fancy a coat like Spike's? Start saving, because in it's new state - before it
was &quot;distressed&quot; (dirtied down) by the costume department - it cost about
£1000.<P>

<B>Chris's Notes</B><P>

The scene in Buffy's dream at the beginning of the episode, when Joyce turns to Buffy and says "Do you really think you're ready?" could have two meanings. The first is explained later in the episode - Buffy wants to starts driving. It could also be a reference to Buffy and Angel's relationship, which reaches it's climax (cough, so to speak) later on in the episode.<P>
