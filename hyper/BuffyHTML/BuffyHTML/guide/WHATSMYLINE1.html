&quot;Something's coming Buffy, and whatever it is, I can guarantee it's not good.&quot; - Giles
<P>
It's Career Week at Sunnydale High for everyone but Buffy -- her fate as the
Slayer has already been sealed. While Buffy is bummed, Spike seeks out a cure
for Drusilla by having a transcriber go through a book stolen from Giles. They
realize the book is in code, and through tarot cards, they can figure out what
to do. While at the cemetery, Buffy enters a mausoleum and sees the
transcriber and another vampire -- she's able to kill the vampire, but the
transcriber eludes her. When she returns home, Angel is waiting for her and
warns her of trouble. She's still upset about Career Day, and reveals her
secret childhood obsession with ice skater Dorothy Hamill.<P>

Giles worries about the missing vampire and what was taken from the mausoleum.
We see Spike with a coffin pillow adorned with a cross -- part of the cure. He
knows if Buffy keeps interrupting, he'll never get the key to curing Drusilla,
so he decides to summon bounty hunters -- the most savage of killers. Giles
chastises Buffy as they examine the mausoleum together and Giles finds the
name &quot;duLac&quot; -- he was the author of the stolen book Spike has; a book of evil
spells written in archaic Latin. They realize the cross has been stolen from
his crypt, and it is the tool which will allow Spike to wreak havoc -- Giles
says he must decipher the book first in order to save them. Meanwhile, we
strangers start hitting town and doing their damage-- one is a door-to-door
cosmetic salesman, one is an evil-looking guy, and one is a beautiful woman.<P>

Buffy blows off the deciphering session to go skate with Angel, but Evil Guy
is already there. Angel tries to save her but she's able to cut the guy's
throat with her skate blade. Angel wigs when he sees the guy's ring -- Giles
identifies it as the symbol of the Order of Teraka -- the deadly assassins.
These are not the ordinary vamps; they'll stop at nothing to kill everything
in their paths. Buffy freaks and goes to Angel's house while Angel goes to a
local bar, trolling for information about the bounty hunters. The beautiful
woman arrives and attacks Angel, locking him in a cage where he'll be
vulnerable to deadly sunlight within hours. While working with the
transcriber, Spike has finally found the answer to curing Drusilla. As Xander
and Cordelia go looking for Buffy at her house, Cordelia lets the cosmetics
salesman in. Back at Angel's house, the beautiful woman tries to kill Buffy
with an axe, identifying herself as Kendra, the Vampire Slayer...

<B>More Information</B><P>

Noxon and Gordon use the two-episode format to unravel their tale at a
leisurely pace, allowing this episode to gradually build up to the intriguing
cliffhanger. It also affords them the opportunity for some very nice character
development.<P>

Drusilla - if you'll forgive an inappropriate metaphor - really comes to life
this episode, adding a cruel streak that nicely counterpoints the series'
occasional drift into syrupy Mills and Boon-style romance, (this episode's
scenes at the deserted ice rink, for example). Spike's dedication to finding a
cure for Drusilla is rather touching and endearing, a good indicator that the
characters have become well established. The career fair theme is used to
nicely focus the episode's wider discussion of fate and destiny. There are
some nice parallels between Drusilla's tarot interpretations and the career
fair's prediction that Buffy - seemingly doomed to a career in law enforcement
- and Xander have bleak futures ahead of them. Buffy, however, is doubtful
that she will ever have a career other than being the Slayer, a nicely played
scene that reminds viewers of Buffy's unhappiness: &quot;A whole week of &quot;What's My
Line?&quot; only I don't get to play.&quot;<P>

<B>Trivia</B><P>

If you're wondering where you've seen Kelly Connell (who plays insect monster
Norman Pfister) before, it might have been in the cult TV series 'Picket
Fences', where he played Chief Pathologist Carter Pike, M.E.<P>

This episode introduces three recurring characters: Dalton, the scholarly
vampire employed by Spike to translate ancient texts, Kendra, the &quot;other&quot;
vampire slayer, and Willie, the &quot;sleazoid&quot; bartender at the as-yet unnamed
Alibi Room. The episode's most bizarre moment occurs when Willow is woken up,
muttering &quot;Don't warn the tadpoles &quot; Her fear of things amphibian is later
revisited in 'Killed By Death'.<P>

Oz and Willow are introduced to each other in this episode, when they're both
chosen as candidates for careers with &quot;the world's leading software concern&quot;.
The one-eyed assassin doesn't get an on-screen name, but in the episode's
official synopses he's called Octarus.<P>
