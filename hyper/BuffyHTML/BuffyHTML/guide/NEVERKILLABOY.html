<P>
&quot;She is the strangest girl!&quot; - Giles, Owen
<P>
In the middle of a late-night sparring session at the cemetery, Buffy and
Giles discover a ring with a mysterious engraving in it. The scene shifts to
the Master Vampire's lair, where the Master explains that the Anointed One --
the Master's greatest warrior and the Slayer's greatest foe is due to rise
from the ashes of five dead. The next day, Buffy is asked out by a handsome,
poetry-loving classmate named Owen who she is smitten with. Buffy's good mood
is spoiled by Giles, who's connected the engraving in the ring to a violent
prophecy which is about to be fulfilled... that night. Buffy very reluctantly
joins Giles at the cemetery, but nothing happens there. Meanwhile, an airport
van crashes and although the five passengers -- including a burly, tattooed
man who's been ranting incoherently -- survive the wreck, they die when the
van is overtaken by vampires.<P>

The next day, Owen and Buffy decide to try again, much to Giles' (and a very
jealous Xander's) chagrin.<P>

As Buffy prepares for her date, Giles comes over with the news: five people
were killed the night before, just as the prophecy described, and one of them
-- the tattooed man -- was wanted for murder. This leads Giles to believe that
he is the Anointed one. Buffy insists on going on to the Bronze with Owen, but
Willow and Xander agree to go along with Giles to the Sunnydale Funeral Home
so he can check the bodies for clues. Giles is greeted by vampires, and though
Willow and Xander try to help him, they realize this is Buffy's domain. They
run off to the Bronze to fetch her, but she's already hooked up with Owen.
Unable to blurt out their news, they merrily suggest to Buffy a jaunt to the
funeral home.<P>

Once they get there, they're shocked to find Owen has followed them. As Buffy
looks around for clues, the tattooed man -- now a vampire -- arises from a
gurney and tears the place apart. Buffy kicks him, knocking him on a gurney,
which hits the cremation oven and slides him right in. The next day, Owen is
pumped up about the previous night's adventures and can't wait for the next
date. Realizing she almost got him killed, Buffy reluctantly gives him the
&quot;let's be friends&quot; speech. Giles commends her on her maturity, and reminds her
that she did prevent a disaster. But all is not resolved. We see the Master in
his lair, welcoming the Anointed one: it is an eight-year-old boy from the van
accident, who smiles to reveal a mouth full of fangs.<P>

<B>More Information</B><P>

A somewhat doom-laden episode is spiced up with some interesting contrasts,
and a number of very amusing scenes which compensate for the absence of an
involving plot. Highlights include Xander trying to throw a spanner in Buffy's
plans as she prepares for her date with Owen. The episode takes an age to get
started: nothing of note happens in the first half of the episode, although we
are granted an insight into the sorry state of Buffy's love life. It's hard to
form any sort of relationship when you're likely to be called away at any
moment to tackle the forces of evil. It seems that only people who are privy
to Buffy's double life can get close to her.<P>

The siege situation, where the team are defending the funeral home against
hordes of the undead, is reminiscent of Assault on Precinct 13 and, more
pertinently, the classic 1968 horror movie Night of the Living Dead. Sadly,
director David Semel doesn't manage to fully exploit the full dramatic
potential of the situation. Better staged is the vampire attack on the crashed
bus which is very atmospheric. This is an episode that concentrates on
underlining Buffy's responsibilities as the Slayer. Giles explains that he too
has had to make sacrifices. In following the family tradition as a Watcher he
had to abandon his cherished plans to become either a fighter pilot or, rather
bizarrely, a grocer.<P>
