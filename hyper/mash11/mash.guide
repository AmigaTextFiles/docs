As Hawkeye and Trapper are planning to leave for Tokyo, an unusual offer to
swap POW patients between the Chinese and the 4077th comes in. Henry, after
much debate, agrees to send Hawk, Trap, Burns, Radar, and Klinger into enemy
territory.  Burns almost botches the swap when he brings a squirt gun to the
exchange.  Fortunately, the Chinese Dr. Lin Tam has a sense of humor (he
went to U. of Illinois, after all).

Although reports that the war is almost over reach the camp with increasing
frequency, the 4077th is still full with refugees and pri- soners of war.
Fresh casualties pour in as both sides try to gain ground before the
armistice.  A deeply troubled Hawkeye has been sent away to the psychiatric
hospital where Dr. Sidney Freedman tries to help him find the cause of his
breakdown, which is associated with a tragic incident on a trip back from
RR(?) at the beach.

Other members of the unit are coping with the final days of war, and making
plans to get out.  Hot Lips' father is trying to find her a glamorous Army
post.  B.J. is determined to make it back for his daughter's birthday.
Charles wants a plum appointment at a Boston hospital.  Klinger worries
about Soon-Lee's attempts to find her parents.  The normal business of the
camp is interrupted by a runaway Army tank that crashes into the compound
and destroys the half-built latrine.

With two results.  First, Charles wanders off to relieve himself and
stumbles on a group of Chinese musicians.  They surrender and come back with
him to the camp.  Second, the enemy spots the tank and begins to shell the
base.  Father Mulcahy bravely ventures out under fire to release the POWs, a
shell explodes near him, and he suffers a mild concussion.  When B.J.
examines him, he detects a hearing loss that Father Mulcahy begs him to keep
from the rest of the company.

The barrage continues as the unit fails to move the tank out.  Hawk- eye
returns to the 4077th and is called straight into the O.R.  He is urgently
needed because B.J. has received orders permitting him to go home.

Charles learns that he has been appointed to him Boston hospital but
quarrels violently with Hot Lips on discovering that she has pulled strings
for him.  He consoles himself by teaching the Chi- nese musicians a little
touch of Mozart.  Klinger, meanwhile, has brought back a reluctant Soon-Lee
to the safety of the camp, al- though she is still determined to find her
parents.  He is obvi- ously in love.

The pressure on the company is temporarily relieved when Hawkeye, who has
coped successfully with his return to surgery, drives the tank into the
4077th's trash dump.  But only temporarily.  Fires started by incendiary
bombs in the surrounding woods are visible from the camp and Colonel Potter
orders evacuation proceedings.

The Colonel's desperate plea for a relief surgeon is answered un- expectedly
by the return of B.J., who was already one-third of the way home when the
Army recalled him to fulfill the Colonel's staff request.  He misses his
daughter's birthday, but the company hosts a birthday party for an orphan
with B.J. as the guest of honor. Klinger proposes marriage and is accepted
by Soon-Lee.  He is over- joyed.  Charles, however, is not so happy when he
loses his "orches- tra" to a relocation center.

The end of the war is only hours away, but the casualties keep coming in --
among them Charles' flutist.  Finally, the surgical teams learn of the
immediate ceasefire as they operate on a group of desperately wounded
soldiers and civilians.  The war is over.

At the noisy, joyful camp party that night, members of the company talk
about their lives after the war.  Colonel Potter looks forward to be- coming
a semi-retired country doctor.  Hot Lips declares she has opted for the
States and a big city hospital.  Klinger announces his engage- ment and says
that he is staying in Korea to help find Soon-Lee's par- ents.  Charles is
still  going to Boston, despite Hot Lips' "meddling." B.J., of course, wants
to go home, yet refuses to actually say "goodbye" to the others.  And
Hawkeye?  Perhaps, after all, he will not be going to the big city surgical
post that he always dreamed of ...

After Klinger and Soon-Lee marry and leave the camp in traditional Korean
style, the other members of the company depart one by one.  By now, the camp
is a ghost town.  Father Mulcahy leaves to start a new life ministering to
the deaf.  Hot Lips is kissed and hugged.  Even her disagreement with
Charles is reconciled.  Charles himself exits with Rizzo in a garbage truck.
Colonel Potter takes Sophie for one last ride before she is adopted by the
orphanage.  Finally, B.J. and Hawkeye go together on B.J.'s motorbike to
meet Hawkeye's chopper. As Hawkeye looks down over the desolate camp, he
sees a message B.J. has left on the pad:  a GOODBYE marked out in stone.

And yes, "The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy" is really BIG fun :) Same
applies to M*A*S*H. Microsoft isn't fun. Microsoft created Windows, and I
have to curse them every day for it. And I'm talking VERY seriously here.
