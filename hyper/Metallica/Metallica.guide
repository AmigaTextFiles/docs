                  By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
                             Better raise your ears
                    The sound of hooves knocks at your door
                       Lock up your wife and children now
                          It's time to wield the blade
                       For now you have got some company
                          The Horsemen are drawing nearer
                          On the leather steeds they ride
                         They have come to take your life
                           On through the dead of night
                            With the four Horsemen ride
                            or choose your fate and die
                       You have been dying since the day
                                   You were born
                        You know it has all been planned
                        The quartet of deliverance rides
                          A sinner once a sinner twice
                           No need for confession now
                 Cause now you have got the fight of your life
                          The Horsemen are drawing nearer
                          On the leather steeds they ride
                         They have come to take your life
                           On through the dead of night
                            With the four Horsemen ride
                            or choose your fate and die
                                      Time
                           has taken its toll on you
                         The lines that crack your face
                                     Famine
                         Your body it has torn through
                            Withered in every place
                                   Pestilence
                        For what you have had to endure
                      And what you have put others through
                                     Death
                          Deliverance for you for sure
                          There is nothing you can do
                       So gather round young warriors now
                           and saddle up your steeds
                        Killing scores with demon swords
                       Now is the death of doers of wrong
                         Swing the judgment hammer down
                    Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
                          The Horsemen are drawing nearer
                          On the leather steeds they ride
                         They have come to take your life
                           On through the dead of night
                            With the four Horsemen ride

                   Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
                      Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean

                                It is going to take
                                 Your breath away
                Don't stop for nothing its full speed or nothing
                I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
                Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
                   Sending the shivers up and down your spine

                                 Your breath away
                 Those people who tell you not to take chances
                   They are all missing on what life is about
                 You only live once so take hold of the chance
                Don't end up like others the same song and dance
                                    Motorbreath
                              Its how I live my life

            Metallica, originally performed by Diamond Head

I gotta see you moving fast
See you come my way
See the dreams, I hope they last
Never fade away.
Gotta see the lights above
Make it loud tonight
Gotta set it all a-fire
Set it all a-light
See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I am gonna set you all a-light
Gotta make it man
I ain't got a choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
I don't what I'm gonna do
Maybe not tonight
Gotta set you all a-fire
Gotta treat you right.
I can see the flashing lights
Lit before your love, oh
Gotta hear the thunder roar
Coming from above.
See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I'm gonna set you all alight
Gotta make it man
I ain't got no choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
I can see the stars
I can see what's going on
Every night alone
I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell
If I'll make it myself someday
This stage is mine
Music is my destiny.
Cannot squeeze the life from me!
I can see the lights
But I can see what's going on
Every night alone
I sing my song just for fun.
Business in collapse
Some men don't like it so
Helpless maybe babe,
But you can leave or join the show.
Cannot squeeze the life from me!

Look out at the darkness,
And you will see,
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me,
You would not dare,
I am the chill that's in the air.
(chorus)
And I try to get through to you,
In my own special way,
As the barriers crumble,
At the end of the day.
Dark rivers are flowing,
Back into the past,
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future,
What is to be,
As the rivers flow into the sea.
(chorus)
Do not take for granted,
Powers out there,
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion,
Rising from time,
Steep is the mountain which we climb.

Motives changing
Day to day
The fire increases
Masks decay
I look at the river
White foam floats down
The body's poisoned
Got to sit tight
The wait
The wait

After awakening
The silence grows
The screams subside
Distortion shows
Mutant thoughts
Of bad mouthed news
Just another birth
Of distorted views
The wait
The wait

Last Caress
I got something to say
I killed your baby today
It doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead
Well, I got something to say
I raped your mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as she's spread
Sweet lovely death
I'm waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress
(repeats)
Green Hell
Here in this place lies the genie of death
Touch it, see it, Whoa
Here in this place is a means to your end
Touch it, feel it

You've come to this like no one could
I bet you never knew you woke it
And don't you run away from anything
I bet you thought you really could in Hell
We're gonna burn in Hell
Green hell
Like every h' shake apart
In Hell, green hell
Gotta find a way that you will stay
Green hell
Cannot forget about the heat
In Hell, green hell
Hell is green I need a flame
In Hell, green hell
Gonna burn in Hell
Green hell
You've come to this like no one could
I bet you never knew you woke it
And don't you run from anything
I bet you thought you really could take it
Here in this place is the genie of death
Touch it, see it

Here in this place is the way to your end
Touch it, see it

But what in the hell is this world coming to?

Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

chorus:
       Fight fire with fire

We shall die

Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There is someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you!"

chorus:
       Flash before my eyes
       Now it's time to die
       Burning in my brain
       I can feel the flames

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What I am doing here?
(chorus)
Someone help me
Oh please God help me
They are trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slowly
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by the horrid cream
Freed from the frightening dream

                       SONG: For Whom the Bell Tolls

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On the fight, for they are right, yes, by who's to say?
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know
Suffered wounds test there their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
chorus:
       For whom the bell tolls
       Time marches on
       For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time you will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now the will see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things are not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filing me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now He's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it to late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye

Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
chorus:
       Freezing
       Can't move at all
       Screaming
       Can't hear my call
       I am dying to live
       Cry out
       I'm trapped under the ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
(chorus)
Scream from my soul
Fate, mystified
Hell, forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Fell no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
chorus:
       Out of my own, out to be free
       One with my mind, they just can't see
       No need to hear things that they say
       Life is for my own to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell my what to do
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
(chorus)
See they try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life is for my own to live my own way

Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years

       To kill the first born pharaoh son
       I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, land of goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the nil
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
(chorus)
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I
Creep the steps and flood final darkness
Blood
Lambs blood painted door, I shall pass

Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

  Pounding out aggression
  turns into obsession
  cannot kill the Battery
  Cannot kill the family
  Battery is found in me

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, Dominating flurry
We create the Battery

Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths construction

                   Master
     Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings
     twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
     Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
     Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream

     Master
     Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream

Needlework the way, never you betray
life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
chop your breakfast on a mirror
[Chorus]
Master, Master, Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, Master, You promised only lies
Laughter, Laughter, All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, Laughter, laughing at my cries
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
now your life is out of season
[Chorus]
[Fade out with evil laughter].

 Messenger of Fear in sight
 Dark deception kills the light
 Hybrid children watch the sea
 Pray for Father, roaming free
   fearless Wretch
   insanity
   He watches
   lurking beneath the sea
   great Old One
   forbidden site
   He searches
   Hunter of the Shadows is rising
                            immortal
                            in madness You dwell
 Crawling Chaos, underground
 cult has summoned, twisted sound
 Out from ruins once possessed
 fallen city, living death
   fearless Wretch
   insanity
   He watches
   lurking beneath the sea
   timeless sleep
   has been upset
   He awakens
   Hunter of the Shadows is rising
                            immortal
                            in madness You dwell
 Not dead which eternal lie
 stranger eons Death may die
 drain you of your sanity
 face The Thing That Should Not Be
   fearless Wretch
   insanity
   He watches
   lurking beneath the sea
   great Old One
   forbidden site
   He searches
   Hunter of the Shadows is rising
                            immortal

                      SONG: Welcome Home (Sanitarium)

 Welcome to where time stands still
 no one leaves and no one will
 Moon is full, never seems to change
 just labeled mentally deranged
 Dream the same thing every night
 I see our freedom in my sight
 No locked doors, No windows barred
 No things to make my brain seem scarred
 Sleep my friend and you will see
 that dream is my reality
 They keep me locked up in this cage
 can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
    Sanitarium, leave me be
    Sanitarium, just leave me alone
 Build my fear of what's out there
 and cannot breathe the open air
 Whisper things into my brain
 assuring me that I'm insane
 They think our heads are in their hands
 but violent use brings violent plans
 Keep him tied, it makes him well
 he's getting better, can't you tell?
 No more can they keep us in
 Listen, damn it, we will win
 They see it right, they see it well
 but they think this saves us from our Hell
    Sanitarium, leave me be
    Sanitarium, just leave me alone
    Sanitarium, just leave me alone
 Fear of living on
 natives getting restless now
 Mutiny in the air
 got some death to do
 Mirror stares back hard
 Kill, it's such a friendly word
 seems the only way
 for reaching out again.

 No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
 running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
 Victim of what said should be
 a servant `til I fall
 [Chorus:]
    Soldier boy, made of clay
    now an empty shell
    twenty one, only son
    but he served us well
    Bred to kill, not to care
    just do as we say
    finished here, Greeting Death
    he's yours to take away
    Back to the front
    you will do what I say, when I say
    Back to the front
    you will die when I say, you must die
    Back to the front
                  you coward
                  you servant
                  you blindman
 [End Chorus]
 Barking of machinegun fire, does nothing to me now
 sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
 More a man, more stripes you bare, glory seeker trends
 bodies fill the fields I see
 the slaughter never ends
 [Chorus]
 Why, Am I dying?
 Kill, have no fear
 Lie, live off lying
 Hell, Hell is here
 I was born for dying
 Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
 had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
 Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
 left to die with only friend
 Alone I clench my gun
 [Chorus]
 Back to the front.

                            SONG: Leper Messiah

 Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
 circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
 Please, please
 spreading his disease, living by his story
 Knees, knees
 falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
 You will
 [Chorus]
    Time for lust, time for lie
    time to kiss your life goodbye
    Send me money, send me green
    Heaven you will meet
    Make a contribution
    and you'll get a better seat
 [End Chorus]
    Bow to Leper Messiah
 Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
 blind devotion came, rotting your brain
 Chain, chain
 Join the endless chain
 Fame, Fame
 Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
 We see
 [Chorus]
    Bow to Leper Messiah
 Witchery, weakening
 Sees the sheep are gathering
 set the trap, hypnotize
 now you follow
 [Chorus]
 Lie.

                             SONG: Damage, Inc.

 Dealing out the agony within
 charging hard and no one's gonna give in
 Living on your knees, conformity
 or dying on your feet for honesty
 Inbred, our bodies work as one
 bloody, but never cry submission
 Following our instinct not a trend
 go against the grain until the end
 [Chorus:]
    Blood will follow blood
    Dying time is here
    Damage Incorporated
 [End Chorus]
 Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
 stepping out?  You'll feel our hell on your back
 Blood follows blood and we make sure
 life ain't for you and we're the cure
 Honesty is my only excuse
 Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
 Steamroller action crushing all
 Victim is your name and you shall fall
 [Chorus]
 We chew and spit you out
 we laugh, you scream and shout
 All flee, with fear you run
 You'll know just where we come from
    Damage Incorporated
 Damage jackals ripping right through you
 sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
 Know just how to get just what we want
 tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
 Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
 Never happy ending on these dark sets
 All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
 step a little closer if you please
 [Chorus]

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of mother earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend
Never
   Fire
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Blackened is the end
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Color our world blackened
Bustering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Never
   Fire
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Blackened is the end
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Color our world blackened
              Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
   Darkest color
   Blistered earth
   True death of life
Termination....expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
   See our mother
   Put to death
   See our mother die
Smouldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Never
   Fire
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Blackened is the end
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Fire
   Is the outcome of hypocrisy
   Darkest potency
   In the exit of humanity
   Color our world blackened
              Blackened

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
   The ultimate in vanity
   Exploiting their supremacy
   I can't believe the things you say
   I can't believe
   I can't believe the price you pay
   Nothing can save you
 Justice is lost
 Justice is raped
 Justice is gone
     Pulling your strings
 Justice is done
     Seeking no truth
     Winning is all
     Find it so grim
             So true
             So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
   The ultimate in vanity
   Exploiting their supremacy
   I can't believe the things you say
   I can't believe
   I can't believe the price you pay
   Nothing can save you
 Justice is lost
 Justice is raped
 Justice is gone
     Pulling your strings
 Justice is done
     Seeking no truth
     Winning is all
     Find it so grim
             So true
             So real
Lady justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth?i cannot tell
Cannot feel
   The ultimate in vanity
   Exploiting their supremacy
   I can't believe the things you say
   I can't believe
   I can't believe the price we pay
   Nothing can save you
 Justice is lost
 Justice is raped
 Justice is gone
     Pulling your strings
 Justice is done
     Seeking no truth
     Winning is all
     Find it so grim
             So true
             So real
     Seeking no truth
     Winning is all
     Find it so grim

Do you see what i see?
Truth is an offence
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what i hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what i feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express
Do you take what i take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn't matter what you see?
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how i say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is mad for you my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what i fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what i choose?
More alternives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what i need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside to each his own
Do you trust what i trust?
Me, myself and i
Penetrate the smoke screen i see through the selfishlie
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how i say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is mad for you my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you know what i know?
Your money end your wealth
Your silence just to hear your self
Do you want what i want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence lengthen freedom's ring
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how i say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is mad for you my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way

  I can't remember anything
  Can't tell if this is true or dream
  Deep down inside I feel to scream
  This terrible silence stops me
  Now that the war is through with me
  I'm waking up I can not see
  That there is not much left of me
  Nothing is real but pain now
  Hold my breath as I wish for death
  Oh please god,wake me
  Back in the womb its much too real
  In pumps life that I must feel
  But can't look forward to reveal
  Look to the time when I'll live
  Fed through the tube that sticks in me
  Just like a wartime novelty
  Tied to machines that make me be
  Cut this life off from me
  Hold my breath as I wish for death
  Oh please god,wake me
  Now the world is gone I'm just one
  Oh god,help me hold my breath as I wish for death
  Oh please god help me
  Darkness imprisoning me
      All that I see
      Absolute horror
      I cannot live
      I cannot die
      Trapped in myself
      Body my holding cell
  Landmine has taken my sight
      Taken my speech
      Taken my hearing
      Taken my arms
      Taken my legs
      Taken my soul
      Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt modern day
Determining decay
The blattand disarray
Disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
   Shortest straw
Pulled for you
   Shortest straw
Pulled for you
   Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
It's teeth and talons through
Your living catch 22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
Shortest straw
Chalenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
    Shortest straw
Pulled for you
    Shortest straw
Pulled for you
    Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
    Shortest straw
Pulled for you
    Shortest straw
Pulled for you
    Shortest straw
Pulled for you
    Shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallaout has begun
Oppresive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You're reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blaclisted
With vertigo make you dead
Shortest straw
Chalenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give
You take
This life that i forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
  Anger
  Misery
  You'll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
  Anger
  Misery
  You'll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
See into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies
Infanticide
   Harvester of sorrow
   Language of the mad
   Harvester of sorrow
   Language of the mad

                      Song: The Frayed Ends Of Sanity

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
   Old habits reappear
   Fighting the fear of fear
   Growing conspiracy
   Everyone's after me
   Frayed ends of sanity
   Hear them calling
   Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I'm the slave of fear,my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As i wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest,question,wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
  Old habits reappear
  Fighting the fear of fear
  Growing conspiracy
  Everyone's after me
  Frayed ends of sanity
  Hear them calling
  Hear them calling me
Into run
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded i'll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
   Old habbits reappear
   Fighting the fear of fear
   Growing conspiracy
   Myself is after me
   Frayed ends of sanity
   Hear them calling
   Frayed ends of sanity
   Hear them calling
   Hear them calling me

Dear mother
Dear father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in day out live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Dear mother
Dear father
Every thought i'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always cencoring my every move
Children are seen bur are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
   Innocence
   Torn from me without your shelter
   Barred reality
   I'm living blindly
Dear mother
Dear father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact i think for me
No guarantee,it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
Dear mother
Dear father
You've clipped my wings before i learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing i've always heard from you
Do as i say not as i do
  Innocence
  Torn from me without your shelter
  Barred reality
  I'm living blindly
  I'm in hell without you
  Cannot cope without you two
  Shocked at the world that i see
  Innocent victim please rescue me
Dear mother
Dear father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite i feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers little one
don't forget, my son
to include everyone
tuck you in, warm within
keep you free from sin
till the sandman he comes
   sleep with one eye open
   gripping your pillow tight
      exit light
      enter night
      take my hand
      off to never never land
something's wrong, shut the light
heavy thoughts tonight
and they aren't of snow white
dreams of war, dreams of liars
dreams of dragon's fire
and of things that will bite
   sleep with one eye open
   gripping your pillow tight
      exit light
      enter night
      take my hand
      off to never never land
now I lay me down to sleep
pray the lord my soul to keep
if I die before I wake
pray the lord my soul to take
hush little baby, don't say a word
and never mind that noise you heard
it's just the beast under your bed,
in your closet, in your head
      exit light
      enter night
      grain of sand
      exit light
      enter night

why don't you worry about yourself instead
who are you? where ya been? where ya from?
gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
you lie so much you believe yourself
judge not lest ye be judged yourself
   holier than thou
   you are
   holier than thou
   you are
   you know not
before you judge me take a look at you
can't you find somethig better to do
point the finger, slow to understand
arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
it's not who you are it's who you know
others lives are the basis of your own
burn your bridges build them back with wealth
judge not lest ye be judged yourself
   holier than thou

New blood joins this earth
and quikly he's subdued
through constant pain disgrace
the young boy learns their rules
with time the child draws in
this whipping boy done wrong
deprived of all his thoughts
the young man struggles on and on he's known
a vow unto his own
that never from this day
his will they'll take away
    what I've felt
    what I've known
    never shined through in what I've shown
    never be
    never see
    won't see what might have been
    what I've felt
    what I've known
    never shined through in what I've shown
    never free
    never me
    so I dub thee unforgiven
they dedicate their lives
to running all of his
he tries to please them all
this bitter man he is
throughout his life the same
he's battled constantly
this fight he cannot win
a tired man they see no longer cares
the old man then prepares
to die regretfully
that old man here is me
    what I've felt
    what I've known
    never shined through in what I've shown
    never be
    never see
    won't see what might have been
    what I've felt
    what I've known
    never shined through in what I've shown
    never free
    never me

...and the road becomes my bride
   I have stripped of all but pride
   so in her I do confide
   and she keeps me satisfied
   gives me all I need
...and with dust in throat I crave
   only knowledge will I save
   to the game you stay a slave
   rover     wanderer
   nomad     vagabond
   call me what you will
      but I'll take my time anywhere
      free to speak my mind anywhere
      and I'll redefine anywhere
         anywhere I may roam
         where I lay my head is home
...and the earth becomes my throne
   I adapt to the unknown
   under wandering stars I've grown
   by myself but not alone
   I ask no one
...and my ties are severed clean
   the less I have the more I gain
   off the beaten path I reign
   rover     wanderer
   nomad     vagabond
   call me what you will
      but I'll take my time anywhere
      I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
      and I'll never mind anywhere
         anywhere I may roam

never begins it, never, but once engaged...
never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage
don't tread on me

love it or live it, she with the deadly bite
quick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike
shining with brightness, always on surveillance
the eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance
don't tread on me

All that is, was and will be
universe much too big to see

limitations of human understanding
too quick to criticize
obligation to survive

    will be ever
    twisting
    turning
    through the never
in the dark, see past our eyes
pursuit of trhuth no matter where it lies
gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
on a quest, meaning, reason
came to be, how it begun
all alone in the family of the sun
curiosity teasing everyone
on our home, third stone from the sun
    all that is, ever
    ever was
    will be ever
    twisting
    turning
    through the never
on through the never
we must go
on through the never
out of the
edge of forever
we must go
on through the never
then ever comes
    all that is, ever
    ever was
    will be ever
    who we are
    ask forever
    twisting
    turning

                         SONG: Nothing Else Matters

So close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
and nothing else matters
never opened myself this way
life is ours, we live it our way
all these words I don't just say
and nothing else matters
trust I seek and I find in you
every day for us something new
open mind for a different view
and nothing else matters
    never cared for what they do
    never cared for what they know
    but I know
so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
and nothing else matters
    never cared for what they do
    never cared for what they know
    but I know
never opened myself this way
life is ours, we live it our way
all these words I don't just say
trust I seek and I find in you
every day for us something new
open mind for a different view
and nothing else matters
    never cared for what they say
    never cared for games they play
    never cared for what they do
    never cared for what they know
    and I know
so close no matter how far
couldn't be much more from the heart
forever trusting who we are
no nothing else matters

Off through the new day's mist I run
off from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
therefore I am
harvest the land
taking of the fallen lamb
off thuogh the new days mist I run
off from the new day'smist I have come
we shift
pulsing with the earth
company we keep
roaming the land while you sleep
   shape shift     nose to the wind
   shape shift     feeling I've been
   move swift      all senses clean
   earth's gift    back to the meaning of life
bright is the moon high in starlight
chill is the air cold as steel tonight
we shift
call of the wild
fear in your eyes
it's later than you realized
   shape shift     nose to the wind
   shape shift     feeling I've been
   move swift      all senses clean
   earth's gift    back to the meaning of life
I feel I change
back to a better day
hair stands on the back of my neck
in wildness is the preservation of the world
so seek the wolf in thyself
   shape shift     nose to the wind
   shape shift     feeling I've been
   move swift      all senses clean
   earth's gift
   back to the meaning of wolf and man

Pride you took
pride you feel
pride that you felt when you'd kneel
not the word
not the love
not what you thought from above
   it feeds
   it grows
   it clouds all that you will know
   deceit
   deceive
   decide just what you believe
     I see faith in your eyes
     never your hear the discouraging lies
     I hear faith in your cries
     broken is the promise, betrayal
     the healing hand held back by the deepened nail                      
   follow the god that failed
find your peace
find your say
find the smooth road in your way
trust you gave
a child to save
left you cold and him in grave
   it feeds
   it grows
   it clouds all that you will know
   deceit
   deceive
   decide just what you believe
     I see faith in your eyes
     never you hear the discouraging lies
     I hear faith in your cries
     broken is the promise, betrayal
     the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
   follow the god that failed
     I see faith in your eyes
     broken is the promise, betrayal
     the healing hand held back by the deepened nail
     follow the god that failed
pride you took
pride you feel
pride that you felt when you'd kneel
trust you gave

left you cold and him in grave
     I see faith in your eyes
     never you hear the discouraging lies

You just stood there screaming
fearing no one was listening to you
they say the empty can rattles the most
the sound of your voice must soothe you
hearing only what you want to hear
and knowing only what you've heard
you    you're smothered in tragedy
you're out to save the world
    misery
    you insist that the weight of the world
    should be on your shoulders
    misery
    there's much more to life than what you see
    my friend of misery
you still stood there screaming
no one caring about these words you tell
my friend before your voice is gone
one man's fun is another's hell
these times are sent to try men's souls
but something's wrong with all you see
you    you'll take it on all yourself
remember, misery loves company
    misery
    you insist that the weight of the world
    should be on your shoulders
    misery
    there's much more to life than what you see
    my friend of misery
you just stood there creaming

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
while clutching to what you had thought was real
kicking at a dead horse pleases you
no way of showing your gratitude
so many things you don't want to do
what is it? what have you got ot lose
what the hell
what is you think you're gonna find?
hypocrite
boredom sets into the boring mind
    struggle within   it suits you fine
    struggle within   your ruin
    struggle within   you seal your own coffin
    struggle within   the struggling within
home is not a home it becomes a hell
turning it into your prison cell
advantages are taken, not handed out
while you struggle inside your hell
reaching out
grabbing for something tou've got to feel
closing in
the pressure upon you is so real
    struggle within   it suits you fine
    struggle within   your ruin
    struggle within   you seal your own coffin
    struggle within   the struggling within
reaching out for something you've got to feel
while clutching to what you had thought was real
what the hell
what is you think you're gonna find
hypocrite

Open doors so I walk inside
Close my eyes find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes
Just to have them close again
Well on my way
On my way to where I graze
It swallows me
As it takes me in his home
I twist away
As I kill this world

Open doors so I walk inside
Close my eyes find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes
Just to have them close once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down again
Is that the moon
Or just a light that lights this deadend street ?
Is that you there
Or just another demon that I meet ?

The higher you walk
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tells
"Step into the house that Jack built"

The higher you walk
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tells
"Yes this is the house that Jack built"

Open doors as I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take this in
Let the show begin

So tear me open and pour me out
There's a thing inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like a curse, just like a stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip
Don't want your greed
Don't want it
Now tear me open make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps

No one seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime
My whole lifetime

So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you

The more I search the more my need for you
The more I blast the more I bleed for you
You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime
My whole lifetime

And I'm torn
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
And when you see me stretched remind me of what left this outlaw torn

And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
And when you see me stretched remind me of what left this outlaw torn

                              SONG: Am I Evil?
        Metallica, originally performed by DiamondHead (Recorded in 1982)
         - words and music by Brian Tatler and Sean Lindon Harris

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace
Twenty seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil?
I am man
Yes I am
As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread
Takin' no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free
Twenty seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil?
I am man
Yes I am
On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet
Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil?
I am man
I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home
Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil?
I am man
My soul is longing for, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sleep myself
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home
Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil?
I am man
Am I evil?
Yes I fucking am
Am I evil?
I am man, yeah!

Let us have peace, let us have life
Let us escape the cruel night
Let us have time, let the sun shine
Let us beware the deadly sign
The day is coming
Armageddon's near
Inferno coming
Can we survive the blitzkrieg
The blitzkrieg

Save us from fate, save us from hate
Save ourselves before it's too late
Come to our need, hear our plea
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds
The day is dawning
The time is near
Aliens coming
Can we survive the blitzkrieg

Take it all away
Never give an inch
Gotta make a mint

Some long time friend's gonna lose it
In the end who's a fool
Seagull
Give it all away
Stay a bird
Stay a man
Stay a ghost
Stay what you wanna be
Loser
Give it all away
Never stay with the winner
With the man
With all the filthy money
Come on
Keep it on the side
With a ride
On a record on the top
If you're gonna be a bad boy
Breadfan
You got it wrong
Some long time friend's gonna lose it
In the end who's a fool

Stay a bird

           - words and music by Sean Lindon Harris and Brian Tatler

Now I see his face, I see his smile
Such a lonely place, no golden mile
Eyes tell of morbid tales of his black heart
His deeds through ages past tell of his part
See his face, see his smile
Time to die
Angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns
See his face, see his smile
Time to die
I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die
See his face, see his smile
Time to die

Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
Rumor going round, gotta clear out of town, smelling like a dry fish bone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door, carry me away once more.
Never, never, never want it anymore.  Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
(Chorus)
    Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know
Rainy afternoon, on a killer typhone, and it's a playing with my slide trombone.
Any more, anymore, can't take it anymore.
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
(chorus)
Walking down the street, shooting people that i meet, full loaded tommy gun.
Here come the deputy, try fukin' gittin' me, gotta get up and run
They got the sirens lose,I'm running out of juice.They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.

                                    Verse 1
                  The sound of gunfire goes through the night
                   The killing and hatred's a terrible sight
                       Reports come in of a heavy attack
                      Message recieved, we're moving back
                                       
                                    Verse 2
                  Preparations are made for the journey back
                    Hints on survival, supplies are packed
                      No more nights in this eternal hall
                      Destination is simple, we move out

                       Ingenuity needed to keep us alive
                     No time for cowardice, kill & survive
                  Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
                       Nasty word, he'll take your life

                     The silence is over the attack again
                     The killing & hatred, drive me insane
                      Reports come in of a savage attack
                      Message received, we're moving back

                         Meni's wanking all over again
                 Grab a dropcloth, or sheets will get stained
                       Like a porno kid with a porno mag
                      Message received, he's jerking off

   He must come in from the rain
   I fall 'cause I've let go
   The net below has rot away
   So my eyes, seek reality
   And my fingers seek my veins
   
   The trash fire is warm
   But nowhere safe from the storm
   And I can't bear to see
   What I've let me be,
   So wicked and worn
   
   So as I write to you
   Of what is done and to do,
   Maybe you'll understand
   And won't cry for this man,
   'Cuse low man is due
   
   Please forgive me
   
   My eyes seek reality
   My fingers feel for faith
   Touch clean with a dirty hand

   Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
   One for each of us and our sins
   So you lay us in a line
   Push your pins, they make us stumble
   Only you can tell, in time
   If we fall or merely stumble
   
   But tell me, can you heal what father's done,
   Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
   Can you heal the broken worlds within,
   Can you strip away so we may start again?
   Tell me, can you heal what father's done
   Or cut this rope and let us run?
   Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
   You jab another pin, jab another pin in me
   
   Mirror, mirror, upon the wall
   Break the spell or become the doll
   See you sharpening the pins
   So the holes will remind us
   We're just a toys in the hands of another
   And in time the needles turn from shine to rust
   
   But tell me, can you heal what father's done
   Or fix the hole in mother's son?

   Can you strip away so we may start again?
   Tell me, can you heal what father's done

   Jab another pin in me

   Blood for face
   Sweat for dirt
   Three X's for the stone
   To break this curse
   A ritual's due
   I believe I'm not alone
   Shell of shotgun
   Pint of gin
   Ah, numb us up to shield the pins
   Renew our faith which-a way we can
   To fall in love with life again
   To fall in love with life again

   To fall in love
