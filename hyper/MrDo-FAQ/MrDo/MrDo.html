This is an unofficial homepage for the fabulous coin-op <B>"Mr.Do!"</B>
, feel the 80's nostalgia!<BR>
There were many versions of this game, including bootlegs, pirated<BR>
 clones, follow ups, home versions and so on.<BR>
As usual I feel the original unmatched by his many followers, and this<BR>
 homepage will have it as main topic. So far I've collected as much<BR>
 material as I could, every feedback and support is welcome!<BR>
