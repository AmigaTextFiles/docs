<B>Q:</B> How many levels they are?<BR>
<B>A:</B> 10 different scenes, after that it start all over again.<BR>
<I><B>Note:</B></I> if you are good enough and reach level 100 the levelcounter on the<BR>
screen shows 00, cause it can display only 2 digits.
Level 101 is identical to level 01 and so on.<BR>
I give up at Level 188 with 6 lives (no time).
This was the highes level I played.<BR>
Same problem as the levelcounter is in the pointcounter. It
resets it to big but I don't know how<BR> many digits (too long
ago).<BR> [Reported by <B>Michaela Prüß</B>]<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q:</B> Ain't really any changes after scenes start again over 10?<BR>
<B>A:</B> Game seems tougher and centerscreen cakes are sobstituted
 by other foods.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q:</B> Is there any good strategy?<BR>
<B>A:</B> Every player develop one.<BR>
<BR>
Pay attention that if you dig upward and place yourself over a falling<BR>
apple, enemies coming from bottom will tend to allineate with your X axis.<BR>
<BR>
When you take the cake at the center of the screen enemies will stop,<BR>
 you can easily kill them while the AplhaMonsters are descending.<BR>
<BR>
If you miss only one letter to make <B>"EXTRA"</B> you can wait to reach a very<BR>
nasty level then take it here and finish it in a flash without losing
lives.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q:</B> Is the game available for <B>Amiga</B> and if so, where?<BR>
<B>A:</B> Mr.Do! reached the home computer range long before the Amiga hype<BR>
so there is no Amiga version available (except than in emulation,
I play it on <I>Mame</I>).<BR>
<BR>
Ages ago there was a cool bunch of guys converting to Amiga those missing<BR>
fabulous arcade games like Mario, Donkey Kong, Zaxxon, etc., including both<BR>
abart original versions and Amiga enhanced ones in the same file!<BR> They
called themselves <I>Bignonia</I> and had a  wishlist of next-to-be-converted
classics (including Mr.Do!)<BR> aside those yet done.<BR>
I don't hear from them since 1994 so I must assume they are active no<BR>
 more, anyway it can be possible that they finally made Mr.Do! in the<BR>
meantime, I grant nothing but writing them a couple of lines won't hurt,isn't? :),
 so you have to write (sorry, no e-mail address:P ) to:<BR>
<BR>
 Ard Joosse<BR>
 Doornlaan 5<BR>
 4334 BT Middelburg<BR>
 Holland<BR>
<BR>
 including in the letter a request for Mr.Do!, a disk and 1 dollar.<BR>
