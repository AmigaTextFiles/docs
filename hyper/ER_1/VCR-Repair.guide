@node 2.1 "Entertainment - then and now"

Think back 20 years. You went to the theater to see a movie. You watched TV
programs when they were broadcast (there was no cable, remember?) or you
missed them. TV studios and industry had video recording equipment but it was
expensive and cumbersome. Little did you realize at the time, but after some
false starts, the modern video revolution was about to be born. Are we better
off? Whatever you decide, there is no going back. You may be able to leave
your VCR's clock flashing 12:00 but you cannot escape the impact that this
technology has had on so many aspects of your life.

The video cassette recorder is a wonderful example of extremely complex
precision technology that has been made affordable through mass production.
In general, it is usually quite reliable. Treat a modern VCR with a bit of
respect and it will provide trouble free service for a long time. Unlike a TV
where the power circuits take their toll on circuit components, the
electronics in VCR are generally quite reliable and rarely fail. Most VCR
problems are mechanical - dirt and dust in the tape path, deteriorated rubber
parts, dried lubrication, wear of precision parts including the spinning
video heads, and abuse caused by rocks, toys, and peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches.

@node 2.2 "VCR repair"

Even if you are a technoklutz who lets your kids change the light bulbs in
your house and would never consider tackling any actual repair or internal
maintenance of your VCR, some basic awareness of the principles of video
recording and the likely causes for common problems will enable you to
intelligently deal with the service technician. You will be more likely to be
able to recognize if you are being taken for a ride by a dishonest or just
plain incompetent repair center. For example, did you know that one of the
most dreaded of problems - the tape eating VCR - can often be remedied by a
thorough cleaning and a 50 cent rubber tire?

This document will provide you with the knowledge to deal with over 85% of
the problems you are likely to encounter with your VCRs. It will enable you
to diagnose problems and in most cases, correct them as well. First and
foremost are the techniques for cleaning of the tape path and replacement of
rubber parts like belts, tires, and the pinch roller - the solution to many
common problems with VCRs. With minor exceptions, specific manufacturers and
models will not be covered as there are so many variations that such a
treatment would require a huge and very detailed text. Rather, the most
common problems will be addressed and enough basic principles of operation
will be provided to enable you to narrow the problem down and likely
determine a course of action for repair. In many cases, you will be able to
do what is required for a fraction of the cost that would be charged by a
repair center.

Should you still not be able to find a solution, you will have learned a
great deal and be able to ask appropriate questions and supply relevant
information if you decide to post to sci.electronics.repair. It will also be
easier to do further research using a repair text such as the ones listed at
the end of this document. In any case, you will have the satisfaction of
knowing you did as much as you could before taking it in for professional
repair. With your new-found knowledge, you will have the upper hand and will
not easily be snowed by a dishonest or incompetent technician.

@node 2.3 "Repair or replace"

While VCRs with new convenience features are constantly introduced, the basic
function of playing a tape has not changed significantly in 20 years. Even
the introduction of HQ about 10 years ago does not represent a dramatic
improvement. Therefore, unless you really do need a quick start transport, a
real time counter, index search, or the like, repair may not be a bad idea.
The older VCRs are built much more solidly than the $150 models of today.
Even high end VCRs may be built around a poorly designed transport and flimsy
chassis. Many older VCRs - for example 10 year old Panasonic models (and
their clones) can be kept functional - nearly indefinitely, it would seem -
at minimal cost.

If you need to send or take the VCR to a service center, the repair could
easily exceed half the cost of a new VCR. Service centers may charge up to
$50 or more for providing an initial estimate of repair costs but this will
usually be credited toward the total cost of the repair (of course, they may
just jack this up to compensate for their bench time).

If you can do the repairs yourself, the equation changes dramatically as your
parts costs will be 1/2 to 1/4 of what a professional will charge and of
course your time is free. The educational aspects may also be appealing. You
will learn a lot in the process. Thus, it may make sense to repair that old
clunker so the kids will have their own VCR or you will have a convenient
means of copying tapes (legally, of course).

@node 3.1 "Helical scan video recording"

Modern VCRs - both consumer and professional - are based on what is known as
helical scan recording. The main technological challenge that confronted the
designers of early video recording machines was achieving the necessary
bandwidth - several MHz - to faithfully capture the high frequency video
signal. The first such machines ran normal audio tape past stationary
recording heads at high speed - 10s of feet per second - in an attempt to
solve this problem. Needless to say, the mechanisms were complex, a finite
length of tape could only record a few minutes of video, and the heads wore
out almost as quickly. If anything - anything at all - went wrong with the
tape transport, you were up to your eyeballs is spilled tape. An alternative
technology was clearly needed.

Prior to practical video tape recording, the only way to preserve a TV show
was to use special equipment that essentially made a film of it off of a
video monitor. The quality of such recordings was not very good, editing was
difficult, the film needed to be developed so playback was not immediate, and
of course, the film could not be erased and reused.

The first successful commercial video tape recorder was introduced around
1956 with the Ampex Quadplex - a $50,000 machine using 2 inch open reel tape
and a high speed spinning head with 4 pickups rotating across the tape. This
event revolutionized commercial broadcasting. However, this technology was
much too complex, cumbersome, and expensive for consumer use and has a number
of technological disadvantages as well.

For a consumer video tape recorder to be successful it was felt that the
following three major hurdles had to be overcome:

   o Tape loading had to be simple and foolproof using a cassette - none of
     this open reel stuff.

   o A cassette had to hold at least an hour of color video.

   o The cost to the consumer had to be less than $1000 (1970's dollars!) for
     the machine and perhaps $20 per hour for the tape.

The rotating heads of the Quadplex machine provided the needed tape-head
speed to achieve sufficient video bandwidth. However, the transport was much
too complex for a consumer machine. Another disadvantage was that since a
video frame consists of many adjacent tracks on the tape (16), special
effects like stop motion as well as forward and reverse search were not
possible without a frame store. While this would not be out of the question
today, the cost of such a device in the 1950's would necessitate the consumer
taking out a second mortgage to pay for it. Finally, the 2 inch wide format
required too much tape for achieving a cost effective 1 hour program time and
made the design of a manageable cassette an impossibility. A separate room
would be needed to house a modest size video tape library!

Helical scan overcomes most of these problems. Rather than scanning across
the tape, the tape is wrapped a bit over 180 degrees around a rotating drum
at a slight angle. Thus, successive tracks are written diagonally across the
tape and can thus be much longer than the width of the tape as in the
Quadplex. The tape, therefore can be rather narrow. The first helical scan
tapes used a 1 inch format but narrower tape soon followed. The most common
formats today are forms of VHS (and BETA) at 1/2", and 8 mm (mostly used for
portable applications in camcorders and data storage.) 4 mm tape is used for
high quality audio (DAT) as well as data storage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 3.2 "VHS video"

Most of the following discussion unless otherwise noted applies to the VHS
format. Beta, which preceded VHS into the marketplace and which has all but
disappeared for consumer VCRs is actually a somewhat better system
technologically with superior picture quality. However, Sony's licensing
practices with respect to BETA made it inevitable that VHS would triumph in
the marketplace. Too bad in some ways.

Each track corresponds to 1 field of the interlaced video format. Generally,
two heads opposite each other on the rotating head drum are used. One
rotation of the drum corresponds to a complete video frame with heads
designated A and B for the even and odd fields respectively. What this also
provides is the ability to easily implement a variety of special effects
including freeze frame, and fully variable speed forward and reverse motion
with a recognizable and in many cases, quite clear picture. With relatively
minor restriction, this becomes as simple as moving the tape forward or
backward or keeping it stationary.

(Camcorders and other compact systems may use 2 pairs of identical heads
where the opposing pairs are separated by 270 instead of 180 degrees. This
permits the use of a smaller, lighter video drum.)

The A and B heads are not identical either. Their azimith angle differs being
+6 degrees for one and -6 degrees for the other. This is one of several
techniques used to minimize crosstalk between adjacent tracks. Azimith angle
is how far the head gap is from being perfectly perpendicular to the
direction of tape-tape motion. For example, a head with an azimith such as /
will ignore most of the information recorded with an azimith of \.

Note that the head gap - the distance between pole pieces - is on the order
of 1 um - 1/25,000 of an inch. As a point of reference, a human red blood
cell is about 7 um in diameter and an average sheet of typing paper is about
100 um in thickness. The gap is filled with a nonmagnetic material to prevent
it from getting clogged and to force the magnetic flux out of the head
structure and into the tape magnetic coating. This remarkably fine spacing is
necessary to achieve the multimegahertz video bandwidth.

Actual tape motion for a VCR is remarkably slow. To someone familiar with
audio decks, the tape in a VCR even at SP speed (the fastest) seems to be
crawling along. Their first reaction is often one of: "there must be
something wrong as the tape is moving sooo slooowly." Nope, just amazing
technology. The SP speed of a VHS VCR corresponds to a linear tape speed of
only 1-5/16 ips - slower than for an audio cassette deck (1-7/8" ips). EP
speed is 1/3 of this - 7/16 ips. However, the effective tape speed as seen by
the video heads is over 15 feet per second due to the spinning video head
drum.

The luminance (Y) and color (C) components of the composite video signal are
recorded differently. Luminance, which is in effect the black and white
picture with all the high resolution components but no color, is frequency
modulated on a carrier at around 3.4 Mhz. The deviation is about 1 Mhz and
the maximum frequency recorded on a VHS tape is a little over 5 Mhz (BETA is
slightly different and S versions of BETA and VHS extend some of these to
achieve higher bandwidths. The color signal is separated from the composite
video and is amplitude modulated on a 629 KHz carrier. This is called the
color under' system. The 'U' in U-Matic, a very popular industrial VCR 3/4"
format (which predates Beta and VHS and is still in use) stands for this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 3.3 "VHS audio"

Sound for the VHS format is not merged into the video signal on the tape. For
non-HiFi VHS VCRs, a separate stationary tape head is responsible for the
audio signal. Due to the very slow tape speed, audio quality is not even
comparable to a cheap audio cassette player even at the SP speed. VHS HiFi
overcomes this by FM recording of the audio signal deep in the tape (recorded
by a separate set of HiFi heads just before the video information), actually
buried under the video information.

Since the head-tape speed for the VHS audio track is the same high rate as
for the video track and exceeds that of a typical audio cassette deck by a
factor of more than 100, VHS HiFi audio reproduction - frequency response,
signal to noise ratio, and dynamic range - is excellent and approaches that
of a CD. In fact, using a T120 video cassette in EP (SLP, 6 hour) mode simply
to record stereo music (with the video ignored or blanked) is extremely cost
effective. What other media/technology will store a 6 hour concert with
nearly perfect reproduction for under $2? (Note: if you do this, some VCRs
will require some kind of video input to maintain stable tape speed. You can
just ignore the video portion on audio playback.)

There are two disadvantages to VHS HiFi, however: (1) there may be some
degradation of video quality due to unavoidable interactions with the buried
audio, and (2) it is not possible to rerecord (dub) only the audio without
disturbing the video.

@endnode
@node 3.4 "VCR servo systems"

Linear tape motion and head drum rotation must be precisely synchronized
during record, play, and special effects play modes. The general functioning
is similar for all but the source of the basic reference signal differs for
play and record. Some of the specific relationships may differ depending on
the specific VCR design.

Record: reference signal is vertical sync pulse from video input:

   o Head drum rotation is phase locked to vertical sync pulse so that
     appropriate head (of the A-B pair) is in contact with the tape during
     the appropriate video field.

   o The speed of the capstan which moves the tape through the transport is
     also locked to the vertical sync pulses so that the selected linear tape
     speed (SP, LP, EP) is maintained.

   o Control pulses (30 Hz for US NTSC) are recorded along the top edge of
     the tape by a stationary control head.

Play: reference signal is timing pulse derived from quartz oscillator:

   o Capstan rotation speed is locked to a 30 Hz pulse derived from a precise
     quartz crystal oscillator. Head drum rotation is phase locked to the
     control pulses now being read off of the tape by the Control head.

   o The tracking control is used to adjust the relative phase of the head
     drum with respect to the control pulses. This permits the head path
     across the tape to be aligned with the actual recorded tracks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 3.5 "Video Special effects"

For CUE (fast play forward) and REV (fast play reverse), the capstan speed is
phase locked to a multiple of the control track. Since the video heads are
crossing multiple tracks during these modes, some noise bars are unavoidable.
At SP speed, special wide or dual azimith heads are required to minimize this
degradation. Thus, only 4 head VCRs can play SP tapes at fast speeds with
minimal noise. With EP speed, the tracks actually overlap and a normal video
head is wide enough to pick up enough signal from adjacent tracks to produce
a mostly noise free picture. Due to the way adjacent tracks line up with LP
speed, most of these special effects cannot be used due to serious tearing of
the picture. The sophisticated processing needed for proper support at LP
speed is generally not included in modern VCRs due to the apparent lack of
interest in the LP speed (recording support at LP speed seems to be absent in
more and more newer VCRs though they will all play back LP tapes at normal
playback speed).

Really slow speed is usually implemented as a variable frame advance with the
tape fully stopping between frames. Special sets of video heads provide the
best quality. Freeze frame (PAUSE) uses the same set of heads. As with CUE
and REV, acceptable picture quality is provided even with a 2-head VCR for EP
speed recorded tapes. In all cases, picture quality can be further improved
through the use of a digital frame store.

Note that the servo systems in consumer VCRs are rarely precise enough to
implement the kind of instantaneous forward or reverse frame advance that is
present in high performance (and high cost) editing decks having jog shuttle
knobs with instantaneous and precise response.

@node 4.1 "General VCR placement considerations"

Proper care of a VCR does not require much. Following the recommendations
below will assure long life and minimize repairs.

   o Allow adequate ventilation - VCRs are not huge users of power but there
     is some heat buildup nonetheless. Leave at least 1-1.5 inches around all
     sides and top for air circulation. Try not to place the VCR near heat
     producing equipment.

   o Do not put anything on top of the VCR that might block the ventilation
     grill. To be safe, don't put anything on top - period. Tapes are
     especially bad - for the tapes - as the heat and possible magnetic
     fields in the vicinity will tend to age them prematurely.

   o If possible, locate the VCR away from the TV. Some VCRs are particularly
     sensitive to interference from the TV's circuitry and while this won't
     usually damage anything, it may make for less than optimal performance.

   o Don't locate VCRs in dusty areas if possible. Consider the use of a dust
     cover when not actually being used if you have no choice of location.

   o Don't locate VCRs in areas of high (tobacco) smoke or cooking grease
     vapors. I cannot force you to quit smoking, but it is amazing how much
     disgusting difficult to remove brown grime is deposited on sensitive
     electronic equipment in short order from this habit.

   o Make sure all input-output video and audio connections are tight and
     secure to minimize intermittent or noisy pictures and sound.

   o Finally, store video cassettes well away from all electronic equipment
     including and ESPECIALLY loudspeakers. Heat and magnetic fields will
     rapidly turn your priceless video collection into so much trash. It is
     also recommended that you store the cassettes on edge so that the tape
     edges are not subject to pressing against the case and that you run them
     through a VCR or winder/rewinder from start to end and back on FF/REW at
     least once a year (another pair of recommendations that are rarely
     followed).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.2 "Preventive maintenance (PM)"

You no doubt have heard that a VCR should be cleaned and checked
periodically. This is basically good advice but few people actually do follow
it. I cannot give a specific schedule to follow as many factors influence the
amount of wear and tear on your VCR:

   o If you mostly use new brand-name tapes to make your own recordings,
     rarely play rental tapes, and have the VCR located in a clean cool
     relatively dust free and smoke free location, you may be able to go 5
     years with no problems. However, a more prudent interval would be 1-2
     years between preventive maintenance and rubber replacement after 4-5
     years. Obviously, if you time shift every evening or have frequent
     marathon viewing parties you should probably reduce the PM interval.

   o If you play rental movies every weekend or older tapes and have chain
     smokers in the house, every 3 months may not be frequent enough. I would
     suggest 6 months to 1 year between preventive maintenance and rubber
     replacement after 3-4 years.

Realistically, you are not going to do any PM anyway. So, just be aware of
the types of symptoms that would be indications of the need for cleaning or
other preventive or corrective maintenance - erratic loading, need to
convince the VCR to perform certain operations, whirring motors without
completing cycle, VCR taking longer to go into or out of a particular mode
than you recall, jittery or noisy picture, or wavering or muddy sound. If
your inspection reveals deteriorated rubber parts, obviously these should be
replaced regardless of their age.

Of course, acute symptoms like a tape jam or tape munching episode is a sign
of the need for emergency treatment. This still may mean that a thorough
cleaning is all that is needed.

I generally don't consider cleaning tapes to be of much value for preventive
maintenance since they do not run long enough or with enough force to clean
the rollers, stationary heads, and guide posts. Also, the dry type, in
particular, are abrasive and frequent use may cause premature wear to the
expensive video heads.

The following are some reasons to inspect and clean a VCR periodically:

   o This will maintain performance at factory new levels. Dirt, dust, and
     shed tape oxide all contribute to a reduction in stable tape movement
     and possible problems with noisy or jumping pictures and muddy or
     wavering sound.

   o Dirt, dust, and other crud can be deposited on the tapes you run through
     the VCR contaminating them and passing problems on to this or other VCRs
     in the future.

   o Your inspection will reveal if service parts like belts, tires, the
     pinch roller, etc. are in good conditions so that future surprises will
     be minimized.

If you follow the instructions in the section:
@{"General guide to VCR cleaning and rubber replacement" link "6.3"}, there is minimal risk
to the VCR. However, don't go overboard. If the belts are in good condition
(by appearance and stretch test), just clean them or leave them alone. This is
especially true in the (generally infrequent) designs of some models of VCR
tape transports where significant disassembly is required to replace a belt.
In this situation, you risk not being able to put everything back the way it
was. Most belts can be replaced with little or no disassembly beyond removing
the top and bottom covers and possibly any circuit boards that may be in the
way, Sometimes one or two additional screws will need to be loosened or removed
to move a bracket or shield.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 4.3 "Rental tape considerations"

It would be nice for your VCR if rental movies had never been invented. You
have no idea of the history of any tape you bring home. The following may
also apply to tapes in your video library or tapes given to you by friends or
relatives:

   o The tape may be old and old tapes shed a lot more oxide and crud than
     newer tapes. A single playing may clog your video heads.

   o The tape may have been damaged by a prior viewing and one pass through
     may ruin your expensive video heads. A tape that has been seriously
     crinkled due to a VCR tape eating incident and then wound back into the
     cassette may be a ticking time bomb for your VCR. A tape with a partial
     break or one that has been improperly spliced is even more likely to
     cause serious damage. Do not splice tapes - see the section on
     @{"Recovering damaged or broken tapes" link "16.5"}

   o The cassette mechanism itself may have been damaged (from being dropped
     or stored in a hot automobile) with unknown consequences for your VCR.

Note: if you should ever damage a rental tape as a result of a cranky VCR or
for any other reason, don't just give it back to the video store. Please let
them know. Also, if your VCR should jam with a tape inside, do not forcibly
extract it - read the appropriate sections later in this document. If in
doubt, let the video store know what happened and follow their
recommendations.

While I cannot control your viewing habits, playing a lot of old, dirty,
deteriorated tapes (rental or from your own tape library) will eventually
take a toll on your VCR. At the very least, you should perform a general
cleaning and inspection at more frequent intervals.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.1 "Safety"

Once you remove the cover(s) of a VCR (ignoring the warnings about no user
serviceable parts, etc.), there are some risks to you and your VCR. You also,
of course, void the warranty (at least in principle). Therefore, if the unit
is still under warranty, having it serviced professionally may be your wisest
option.

Stay away from the line side of the power supply - put electrical tape over
the exposed connections. To be doubly sure, tape a piece of cardboard or
thick plastic over the power supply section. Other than that, there is more
danger of damaging the VCR by accidentally shorting something out or breaking
a little plastic doodad than of you getting hurt.

   o Don't wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact
     circuitry and conduct current, or get caught in moving parts (protect
     long hair as well).

   o If circuit boards need to be removed from their mountings, put
     insulating material between the boards and anything they may short to.
     Hold them in place with string or electrical tape. Prop them up with
     insulation sticks - plastic or wood.

   o Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered and
     unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped
     locations or difficult to access locations.

   o If you must probe live, put electrical tape over all but the last 1/16"
     of the test probes to avoid the possibility of an accidental short which
     could cause damage to various components. Clip the reference end of the
     meter or scope to the appropriate ground return.

   o Perform as many tests as possible with power off and the equipment
     unplugged. For example, the semiconductors in the switching power supply
     of a VCR can be tested for shorts and the fusable resistors can be
     tested for opens.

   o If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits in a switching
     power supply with the power off, discharge (across) large power supply
     filter capacitors with a 2 W or greater 20-100K resistor and then verify
     with your voltmeter.

   o The use of GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet is a
     good idea but will not protect you from shock from many points in a line
     connected power supply. A circuit breaker is too slow and insensitive to
     provide any protection for you or in many cases, your equipment. A GFCI
     may prevent your scope probe ground from melting should you accidentally
     connect it to a live circuit, however.

   o Don't attempt repair work when you are tired. Not only will you be more
     careless, but your primary diagnostic tool - deductive reasoning - will
     not be operating at full capacity.

   o Finally, never assume anything without checking it out for yourself!
     Don't take shortcuts!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.2 "Troubleshooting tips"

Many problems have simple solutions. Don't immediately assume that your
problem is some combination of esoteric complex convoluted failures. For a
VCR, it may just be a bad belt or an experiment in rock placement by your
3-year old. Try to remember that the problems with the most catastrophic
impact on operation (a VCR that eats tapes) usually have the simplest
solutions (replace the idler tire). The kind of problems we would like to
avoid at all costs are the ones that are intermittent or difficult to
reproduce: the occasional interference or a VCR that sometimes will not
record your favorite soaps on alternate Thursdays before a full moon.

If you get stuck, sleep on it. Sometimes, just letting the problem bounce
around in your head will lead to a different more successful approach or
solution. Don't work when you are really tired - it is both dangerous and
mostly non-productive (or possibly destructive).

Whenever working on precision equipment, make copious notes and diagrams. You
will be eternally grateful when the time comes to reassemble the unit. Most
connectors are keyed against incorrect insertion or interchange of cables,
but not always. Apparently identical screws may be of differing lengths or
have slightly different thread types. Little parts may fit in more than one
place or orientation. Etc. Etc.

Pill bottles, film canisters, and plastic ice cube trays come in handy for
sorting and storing screws and other small parts after disassembly.

Select a work area which is well lighted and where dropped parts can be
located - not on a deep pile shag rug. Something like a large plastic tray
with a slight lip may come in handy as it prevents small parts from rolling
off of the work table. The best location will also be relatively dust free
and allow you to suspend your troubleshooting to eat or sleep or think
without having to pile everything into a cardboard box for storage.

Another consideration is ESD - Electro-Static Discharge. The electronic
components in a VCR are vulnerable to ESD. There is no need to go overboard
but taking reasonable precautions such as getting into the habit of touching
the chassis first before any of the electronic components is a good practice.
The use of an antistatic wrist strap would be further insurance.

A basic set of precision hand tools will be all you need to disassemble a VCR
and perform most adjustments. These do not need to be really expensive but
poor quality tools are worse than useless and can cause damage. Needed tools
include a selection of Philips and straight blade screwdrivers, needlenose
pliers, wire cutters, tweezers, and dental picks. A jeweler's screwdriver set
is a must particularly if you are working on a portable VCR or camcorder. For
adjustments, a miniature (1/16" blade) screwdriver with a non-metallic tip is
desirable both to prevent the presence of metal from altering the electrical
properties of the circuit and to minimize the possibility of shorting
something from accidental contact with the circuitry.

You should not need any VCR specific tools with the possible exception of a
miniature metric hex key wrench set for loosening the set screws on the
roller guides should you need to perform a tape path alignment. I have never
needed a VCR head puller. You can make a tool for the special nut found on
many A/C head assemblies for tracking adjustment by filing a slot in the
blade of a straight blade screwdriver.

A low power fine tip soldering iron and fine rosin core solder will be needed
if you should need to disconnect any soldered wires (on purpose or by
accident) or replace soldered components.

For thermal or warmup problems, a can of 'cold spray' or 'circuit chiller'
(they are the same) and a heat gun or blow dryer come in handy to identify
components whose characteristics may be drifting with temperature. Using the
extension tube of the spray can or making a cardboard nozzle for the heat gun
can provide very precise control of which components you are affecting.

For info on useful chemicals, adhesives, and lubricants, see "Repair Briefs,
an Introduction" as well as other documents available at this site.

If you have several VCRs or do repairs for friends (former friends?), there
are inexpensive kits of VCR mechanical parts like washers and springs that
come in handy. General belt or similar kits are not worthwhile unless you are
in the service business - there is too mach variety in the sizes and other
characteristics of these types of parts to make an assortment a good
investment.

Note: while working with the top off, you may need to put pieces of
strategically located cardboard over the area of the cassette to block
extraneous light from causing erratic behavior (modes aborting, not starting
at all, etc.) with the start/end-of-tape sensors. Not all VCRs are sensitive
to extraneous illumination but I have been bitten more than once by not doing
this. Using overhead instead of direct illumination will probably help as
well. In extreme cases, placing electrical tape over the end sensors may be
needed but this will likely confuse the microcontroller under certain
conditions into thinking that a non- existent tape is present - or if your
troubleshouting will permit, leave a cassette in the transport. (I have heard
of at least one case where this was a problem even for normal operation -
apparently, light was falling on the VCR in just the wrong way where it
happened to be located. The VCR would enter rewind mode regardless of what
the helpless human wanted unless tipped on end!)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.3 "Test equipment"

Don't start with the electronic test equipment, start with some analytical
thinking. Many problems associated with consumer electronic equipment do not
require a schematic (though one may be useful). The majority of problems with
VCRs are mechanical and can be dealt with using nothing more than a good set
of precision hand tools; some alcohol, degreaser, contact cleaner, light oil
and grease; and your powers of observation (and a little experience). Your
built in senses and that stuff between your ears represents the most
important test equipment you have.

A DMM or VOM is necessary for checking of power supply voltages and testing
of sensors, LEDs, switches, and other small components. Unless you get deep
into the electronic repair of VCRs, an oscilloscope is not required.

There are two items of important test equipment that you probably already
have:

   o A video signal source - both RF and baseband (RCA jacks). Unless you are
     troubleshooting tuner or video/audio input problems, either one will
     suffice. RF sources include a pair of rabbit ears or an outdoor antenna,
     a cable connection, or a VCR with a working RF modulator. Similarly, a
     working VCR makes a handy baseband or RF signal source.

   o A display device. A video monitor or TV makes an excellent video signal
     display. Many video problems can be diagnosed by just examining the
     picture. If you have an old TV with a vertical hold control, this is
     useful when adjusting backtension, should the need arise. A B/W TV is
     adequate for many of the tests you will be performing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.4 "Cassette cheaters"

When troubleshooting mechanical problems in a VCR, one of the handiest
accessories is a cassette cheater - a frame to fool the VCR into thinking
there is a cassette in place so that you have access to the reel spindles and
idler.

You can buy these for $6-12 but you can make one that is almost as nice. Take
a discarded cassette, open it up and throw away everything but the top and
bottom halves and the screws. Punch out the plastic windows (and somewhat
more of the top and bottom if you are so inclined). Reassemble the two halves
of the cassette. Put a bit of electrical tape over the sensor holes on the
sides. This will load and 'play' just fine except that some machines actually
sense that the supply reel is being turned by the tape movement during
loading or always and will shut down if it isn't (among other peculiarities)
so you may have to do this by hand.

There are several benefits to using one of these, one of which is that there
is no chance of ruining a prized tape due to a hungry VCR. You will also be
able to feel the spindles to get an idea whether they are turning properly
and with enough torque in all modes. If you break out enough of the top and
bottom, you will have access to the idler and other under-cassette parts at
the same time. If you examine one of the commercial cassette cheaters, you
will see that very little is needed beyond the outer frame as long as it sits
properly on the indexing posts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.5 "Test tapes"

When aligning the tape path, a test tape will be needed as a reference.
Actually, you want two - one recorded at the SP (2 hour) speed and another
recorded at the EP (6 hour) speed. These do not need to be exorbitantly
priced professional alignment tapes. A couple of recordings made on a known
working VCR will get you close enough for most purposes. Do not use these
same tapes for diagnosing or testing of mechanical problems, your VCR may be
hungry and they may get eaten.

For general video diagnosis including mechanical and tape eating problems, a
bunch of sacrificial tapes is handy - advertizing, promos, feature shorts -
anything you do not care about but have been recorded on working VCRs. Very
often they get mangled and you do not want to continue to use mangled tapes
which may damage the VCR - in particular the video heads. However, once you
have the VCR basically working, you will want to test it start to finish on a
T120 cassette. This is because the reel hub size on those short video
cassettes is not the same as a standard (most commonly used) T120 cassette
and may mask problems if the VCR is mechanically marginal in some respects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.6 "Getting inside a VCR"

You will void the warranty - at least in principle. There are usually no
warranty seals on a VCR so unless you cause visible damage or mangle the
screws, it is unlikely that this would be detected. You need to decide. A VCR
still under warranty should probably be returned for warranty service for any
covered problems except those with the most obvious and easy solutions.

It is usually very easy to remove the top and bottom covers on VCRs. For the
top cover, there are usually some very obvious screws on the back or sides,
and in rare cases on the top. There may be a couple of screws on the bottom
as well that secure the top cover. For top loaders, you will probably need to
remove the cassette holder lid - there will be two screws, perhaps hidden by
rubber plugs.

Once all the screws are out, the top cover will lift up or slide back and
then come off easily. If it still does not want to budge, recheck for screws
you may have missed.

For the bottom cover, there are usually a half dozen or so screws around its
perimeter and sometimes in the middle as well. There may be one or two
grounding screws as well which are of different length and threads - these
should go back in the same location from where they came. Bottom covers are
usually simple sheet metal. In rare cases, you will need to remove the front
panel to free the bottom cover (or vice-versa).

Circuit boards may prevent access to the top or bottom of the tape transport.
Usually, removal of a few screws (often marked with red paint or arrows on
the circuit board) and perhaps pressing of a couple of snaps will permit the
board to be swung up on a hinge out of the way.

Front panels usually snap off, possibly requiring the removal of a few screws
on top or bottom.

Make notes of screw location and type and store the screws away in a pill
bottle, film canester, or ice cube tray.

When reassembling the equipment make sure to route cables and other wiring
such that they will not get pinched or snagged and possibly broken or have
their insulation nicked or pierced abd that they will not get caught in
moving parts. Replace any cable ties that were cut or removed during
disassembly and add additional ones of your own if needed. Some electrical
tape may sometimes come in handy to provide insulation insurance as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.7 "Why does my VCR shut down or behave strangely when I remove the cover?"

There are various sensors in a VCR that are light sensitive - it is not a
safety interlock (though it acts this way in some VCRs) but a result of the
way the tape start and end sensors operate. VHS tapes have a clear leader and
trailer. An LED or light bulb poking up near the center of the cassette shine
towards sensors at either side of the cassette. When light is detected the
VCR assumes that it is at the appropriate end of the tape and shuts off (or
rewinds if in PLAY mode when it senses the end depending on model).

During servicing, a piece of opaque cardboard or other insulating material
should be placed above the cassette basket if any strange behavior is
detected that was not present with the cover in place. Not all VCRs are
particularly sensitive external illumination.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.8 "Getting built up dust and dirt out of a VCR"

This should be the first step in any inspection and cleaning procedure.

Do not be tempted to use compressed air!

I would quicker use a soft brush to carefully dust off the circuit boards and
power supply. Work in such a way that the resulting dust does not fall on the
mechanical parts.

For the deck itself, using compressed air could dislodge dirt and dust which
may then settle on lubricated parts contaminating them. High pressure air
could move oil or grease from where it is to where it should not be. If you
are talking about a shop air line, the pressure may be much much too high and
there may be contaminants as well.

A Q-tip (cotton swab) moistened with politically correct alcohol can be used
to remove dust and dirt from various surfaces of the deck (in addition to the
normal proper cleaning procedures for the guides, rollers, heads, wheels,
belts, etc.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 5.9 "What to do if a tiny tiny part falls into the VCR"

We have all done this: a tiny washer or spring pops off and disappears from
sight inside the guts of the unit. Don't panic. First - unplug the VCR if it
is plugged into the AC. Remove the battery pack from a camcorder.

Try to locate the part with a bright light without moving the VCR. You may
have gotten lucky (yeh, right). Next, over an area where a dropped part will
be visible (not a shag carpet!), try any reasonable means to shake it loose -
upside down, a little gently tapping and shaking, etc. A hard surface is
better in some ways as you might hear the part drop. On the other hand it may
bounce into the great beyond.

If this does not work, you have two options:

  1. Assume that the part has landed in a place that will not cause future
     problems. There could be electrical problems if it is metallic and
     shorts out some circuitry or there could be mechanical problems if it
     jams some part of the mechanism. There is an excellent chance that the
     part will never cause any harm. What chance? I don't know, maybe 99%. It
     is not worth taking the unit to pieces to locate the part. You are more
     likely to damage something else in the process. Obtain a replacement and
     get on with your life. The exception is, of course, if you now begin
     experiencing problems you **know** were not there before.

  2. Take the unit to pieces in an attempt to locate the part. For all you
     know, it may be clear across the room and you will never find it inside.
     If all the gymnastics have not knocked it loose, then it may be really
     wedged somewhere and will stay there - forever. If the VCR behaves
     normally, then in all likelihood it will continue to do so.

To prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future you will no doubt
be much more careful. In addition, consider constructing a paper dam around
the area when you are attempting to remove a reluctant E-clip or spring.
Keeping one finger on the part as it is removed will tend to prevent
uncontrolled ejection as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.1 "Parts of the tape transport in a VCR"

The following description applies to 99.9% of the VCRs in existence today. I
have seen one that had a sideways loading mechanism - very weird.

Looking at the unit from above with the front toward you:

   o Supply reel - left hand side platform on which the supply tape spool
     sits. Edge which contacts idler tire should be cleaned.

   o Takeup reel - right hand side platform on which the takeup tape spool
     sits. Edge which contacts idler tire should be cleaned.

   o Idler - assembly which swings between supply and takeup reels and
     transfers power to the appropriate reel to wind the tape up during play
     and record and often to drive FF and REW.

   o Idler tire - the black rubber ring on the outside of one part of the
     idler which actually contacts the reel edges. This is single most likely
     part to need replacement after a few years of use. Some VCRs use a gear
     instead of a tire, but the tire is most common, especially in older
     units. Clean and inspect - replace if in doubt. Some VCRs use gears in
     place of rubber. Teeth can break off but these are generally quite
     reliable. Some high-end decks may have separate motors for reel
     rotation.

   o Roller guides - there are two, one on each side. These assemblies move
     from their retracted position toward front of machine to their loaded
     position for play and record. The white rollers should spin freely and
     be clean. When retracted, the roller guide assemblies will be slightly
     loose. However, when the tape is wound around the video head drum, they
     must be snug against the V-stoppers - the brackets at the end of the
     tracks. Also on the same assembly are tilted metal guide posts - again
     one for each side. These sometimes fall out with obvious consequences.
     Proper functioning and adjustment of the roller guides is the most
     critical requirement for proper tracking. (However, do not touch their
     settings without being really sure that they are at fault and not until
     you have read the sections relating to @{"tape path alignment" link "19"}) Clean and
     inspect.

   o Video head drum - almost 3 inch diameter by 3/4" high contains the video
     heads (and HiFi audio and flying erase heads, if present). Stay away
     from this unit - video heads are very delicate. If you must clean it,
     refer to the specific instructions on cleaning video heads elsewhere in
     this document. Video heads do not normally require cleaning despite what
     the cleaning tape people will have you believe. If you are not having
     video noise problems, they should be left alone.

   o Capstan - right side after tape exits from roller guide. The capstan is
     a shaft about 3/16" diameter which during play and record (and search)
     modes control tape movement forward or reverse when the pinch roller is
     pressed against it. Should be cleaned to assure proper tape movement
     during play, record, and search modes.

   o Pinch Roller - black rubber roller about 1/2" diameter, 3/4" high which
     spins freely and is pressed against the capstan during play, record, and
     search modes. A hard, shiny, dried out pinch roller can lead to tape
     edge munching and erratic sound/speed/tracking. Clean thoroughly.
     Inspect for cracked or deteriorated rubber.

   o Audio/Control Head assembly - between right roller guide (when tape is
     loaded around drum) and capstan. Includes magnetic heads for non-hifi
     (linear) audio and synchronization control track. Should be cleaned
     since tracking and non-hifi audio performance is critically dependent on
     its performance.

   o Back-Tension Arm - left side just as tape exits cassette - this is
     coupled to a felt band and serves to maintain a constant tension on the
     tape during play, record, and forward search. Retracts toward cassette
     when tape is unloaded. Backtension is somewhat critical and may need
     adjustment after long use.

   o Various other guide posts - vertical stationary metal posts which tape
     contacts. Should be cleaned but rarely need adjustment.

   o Full erase head - left side towards rear which tape passes over just
     before going around roller guide, guide post, and drum. Rarely causes
     problems. Clean.

   o Impedance Roller - left side near full erase head. Freely rotating
     roller stabilizes tape movement. Clean.

   o Belts - various size black rubber bands - a typical VCR will have
     between 0 and 12 of these on top and bottom. Typical is 3 or 4. These
     will need replacement after a few years. Clean and inspect.

   o VCR refuses to FF or REW and shuts off.
   o VCR shuts off entering PLAY or REC or at random during PLAY or REC.
   o VCR eats tapes.
   o VCR doesn't accept tapes or ejects them without cause.
   o Sound is wavery, fluctuating, or muddy.

The cause for all of these is very often a bad idler tire or other dirty,
worn, or tired rubber parts. See the section below:
@{"General guide to VCR cleaning and rubber replacement" link "6.3"} A VCR that just munched down your favorite
tape is very likely only in need of a little tender loving care.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.3 "General guide to VCR cleaning and rubber parts replacement"

All the guideposts, wheels, and rubber parts of a VCR should be cleaned
periodically - how often depends on usage. Of course, no one really does it
unless something goes wrong.

Do not attempt to clean the video heads until you follow the proper procedure
given elsewhere in this document, you can break them - very expensive lesson.
In most cases, they do not need attention anyhow.

Q-tips and alcohol (91% medicinal is ok, pure isopropyl is better. Avoid
rubbing alcohol especially if it contains any additives) can be used
everywhere except the video heads. Just dry quickly to avoid leaving residue
behind or damaging the rubber parts further.

Cleaning may get your machine going well enough to get by until any
replacement rubber parts arrive and to confirm your diagnosis.

Things to clean:

  1. Capstan and pinch roller. These collect a lot of crud mostly oxide which
     flakes off of (old rental) tapes. Use as many Q-tips (wet but not
     dripping with alcohol) as necessary to remove all foreign matter from
     the capstan (the shiny shaft that pulls the tape through the VCR for
     play and record). Just don't get impatient and use something sharp - the
     crud will come off with the Qtips and maybe some help from a fingernail.

     Clean the pinch roller (presses against the capstan in Play, Record, and
     Search mode CUE and REVIEW) and until no more black stuff comes off. Use
     as many Qtips as necessary until no more black gunk collects on Q-tip.

     If the pinch roller is still hard, shiny or cracked, it will probably
     need replacement. Many are available for about $6 from the sources
     listed at the end of this document. It is sometimes possible to put the
     pinch roller in an electric drill, drill press, or lathe, and carefully
     file off the hard shiny dried out rubber surface layer, but only use a
     last resort - and this fix is probably temporary at best.

  2. Various guideposts including the roller guides (the white rollers on
     metal posts which are near the video head drum when in play or record
     mode). When in FF or REW, or with no tape present, these move on tracks
     to a position toward the front of the VCR. Note that the roller guides
     with the white rollers and tilted metal posts will be fairly loose when
     in the unloaded position (but you should not be able to lift them off
     the tracks). When actually playing or recording a tape, they will be
     snug against the stoppers at the end of the tracks.

  3. Idler tire (idler swings between reels and transfers motor power to
     reels - clean until no more black stuff comes off. A dirty or worn idler
     tire is probably the single most common VCR problem.

     If the idler tire appears cracked, glazed, or dried out, it will need to
     be replaced. About $.50-$1.00. As a temporary measure, you can usually
     turn the tire inside-out and replace it. The protected inner (now outer)
     surface will grip well enough to restore functionality until a
     replacement tire arrives - and verify the diagnosis as to the cause of
     your problem.

     Also, the idler assembly includes a slip clutch. If this weakens, the
     idler may not have enough force to press on the reel table edges. If it
     becomes too tight, there may be audio, video, or crickled tape problems
     and/or excess wear of the idler tire. When in doubt, the entire idler
     assembly is often available as a replacement part. They can often be
     disassembled and adjusted if necessary.

  4. Reel table edges - surface on the reel tables where the idler contacts.

  5. Audio/control head (right side) and full erase head, (left side). Q-tips
     and alcohol are ok for these.

  6. Anything else that the tape contacts on its exciting journey through
     your machine.

  7. Rubber belts. Access to some of these will probably require the removal
     of the bottom cover. After noting where each belt goes, remove them
     individually (if possible) and clean with alcohol and Qtips or lint free
     cloth. Dry quickly to avoid degrading the rubber from contact with the
     alcohol. If a belt is trapped by some assembly and not easy to remove,
     use the Qtip on the belt and/or pulley in place. However, if it is
     stretched, flabby, or damaged, you will need to figure out how to free
     it.

     Make sure that there are no twists when a square cut belt or replacement
     is installed on its pulleys.

     On some models, you may need to unscrew circuit board(s) blocking access
     to either the top or bottom of the tape transport. Make notes of what
     went where - particularly different types of screws and routing of
     wires.

     Any belts that appear loose, flabby or do not return instantly to their
     relaxed size when stretched by 25% or so will need to be replaced and
     may be the cause of your problems. Belts cost about $.30-$2.00 and
     complete replacement belt kits are often available by model for $3.-$12.
     Meanwhile, the belts will function better once they are cleaned, maybe
     just enough to get by until your replacements arrive.

  8. Video heads: READ CAREFULLY. Improper cleaning can ruin the expensive
     video heads. DO NOT attempt to clean the video heads without reading and
     following the procedure described in the section on @{"video head cleaning" link "18.4"}

     While VCRs should be cleaned periodically, the video heads themselves
     usually do not need cleaning unless you have been playing old or
     defective rental tapes which may leave oxide deposits on the tips of the
     delicate ferrite head chips. Unless you are experiencing video snow,
     intermittent color, or loss of or intermittent HiFi sound (HiFi VCRs
     only, the HiFi heads are located on the video head drum and for the
     purposes of cleaning, treated the same way) leave the video heads alone.

     If you really feel that video head cleaning is needed, refer to the
     sections on @{"video head problem diagnosis and cleaning" link "18"} elsewhere in this
     document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.4 "Lubrication of a VCR"

The short recommendation is: Don't add any oil or grease unless you are
positively sure it is needed. Most parts in a VCR are lubricated at the
factory and do not need any further lubrication over their lifetime. Too much
lubrication is worse then too little. It is easy to add a drop of oil but
difficult and time consuming to restore a VCR that has taken a swim.

NEVER, ever, use WD40 in a VCR! WD40 is not a good lubricant despite the
claims on the label. Legend has it that the WD stands for Water Displacer -
which is one of the functions of WD40 when used to coat tools. WD40 is much
too thin to do any good as a general lubricant and will quickly collect dirt
and dry up.

A light machine oil like electric motor or sewing machine oil should be used
for gear or wheel shafts. A plastic safe grease like silicone grease or
Molylube is suitable for gear teeth, cams, and the roller guide tracks.

Unless the VCR was not properly lubricated at the factory (which is quite
possible), the only likely areas needing lubrication are the roller guide
tracks - clean and grease. Sometimes you will find a dry capstan, motor,
lever, or gear shaft but this is less likely.

In general, do not lubricate anything unless you know there is a need. Never
'shotgun' a problem by lubricating everything in sight! You might as well
literally use a shotgun on the VCR!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 6.5 "Head demagnetizing"

With audio tape decks, demagnetizing is often recommended to improve sound
quality and frequency response. There is some debate as to how much benefit
there is to this practice but if done properly, there is little risk.
Demagnetizing removes the residual magnetic fields that can build up on
ferrous parts of the tape heads and various guideposts and other parts in the
tape path which may affect frequency response.

For the following, do not go near the video head drum, only perform
demagnetization of the stationary A/C head, erase head, and guide posts and
rollers. In my opinion, the video heads should almost never need to be
demagnetized. The ferrite material from which they are constructed is not
prone to easily being magnetized like steel.

Use a small demagnetizer designed for a tape deck or cassette deck. Do not
use anything homemade that might be too powerful or a bulk tape eraser which
would certainly be too powerful.

Make sure the tip is covered with a soft material to prevent damage to the
finely polished surfaces in your VCR.

Turn power on to the demagnetizer when a couple of feet away from the VCR.
Then, slowly bring it in close and slowly go over all surfaces of anything
that the tape contacts or comes close to in the tape transport. The key word
here is SLOWLY. Move fast, and you will make the magnetic fields stronger.
When finished, slowly draw the demagnetizer away to a distance of a couple of
feet before turning it off.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.1 "Cassette loading and eject problems"

Cassette loading places the cassette into proper position on the tape
transport. In a front loader, pushing the cassette gently into the slot
should cause a motor to take over and suck it in and down to rest on indexing
pins. The mechanism that actually holds the cassette is called the cassette
basket. Several types of problems are possible: the VCR may ignore you when
you push the cassette in or press EJECT, or it may spit it out immediately or
cycle back and forth. On a top loader, you do most of the cassette loading
manually, so the only likely problem will be if EJECT does not work.

If attempting to load a cassette produces no response (though the VCR has
power), then there could be a problem with the microswitch that senses the
presence of a cassette, the cassette loading motor (if separate from the main
motor), a slipping or broken belt, or a faulty driver or other electronic
problem. Sometimes this could mean that the microcontroller is confused due
to a faulty mode switch or because the mechanism somehow got into a peculiar
state. Manual cycling of the cassette loading mechanism might reset it.
Gently push a cassette in and turn the appropriate shaft or pulley by hand.
First, try this with the VCR unplugged. If nothing happens or you feel
resistance, try the other direction. Assuming you find no problems - there is
no significant resistance to your turning and the cassette basket cycles from
fully ejected to fully seated on the transport baseplate, leave the cassette
basket in a partially loaded position and plug the VCR into the AC power and
turn it on (this may not be necessary depending on the design of your VCR).
It should now reset itself and either load or eject the cassette. If there
are still no signs of a response, a power supply, motor, or electronic
problem is likely.

If you hear a motor whirring but nothing happens, this is almost certainly a
slipping or broken belt.

If pushing a cassette into the VCR results in it being ejected as though it
tasted really bad (there may or may not be hesitation), or if the cassette
cycles back and forth without stopping, there could be several possible
causes.

If it stops part way during loading, does it pause as though the motor is
straining or just abort with no warning? If the former, then check carefully
for foreign objects, or lack of lubrication. A typical cause is a belt
slipping, usually not the idler in this case. Help it out gently and see if
that will complete the cycle. Sometimes it is helpful to cycle the mechanism
by hand - turning the appropriate shaft or pulley and feeling and watching
for any place where it binds. If the basket moves in the wrong way or you
feel any significant resistance, try the other direction. Sometimes, the
sticky cassette labels partially or totally peal off and clog the works. You
may find a toy or rock inside carefully inserted by your 3 year-old!

If the microcontroller were detecting an abnormality, then it would abort
instantly but would most likely try to unload the tape before giving up. It
is possible that if the expected behavior is not produced by the
end/beginning-of-tape sensors during cassette loading, an abort could be
initiated. Therefore, these sensors could be suspect. In some cases, the mode
switch may be dirty or faulty. A gear may have broken some teeth or slipped a
couple of teeth and the timing relationships may be incorrect. There may be a
microswitch that is controlled by the cassette basket position and this may
be defective or dirty.

Similarly, if the cassette seems to be cycling in and out in an apparently
infinite loop, there may be an obstruction or the microcontroller is confused
by a bad sensor or the basket is out of synchronization with the rest of the
mechanism. A squirt of contact cleaner into the microswitch sensor and/or
reflowing its bad solder connections may solve this type of problem.

Similar comments apply to cases where pressing the EJECT button produces no
response. In particular, if the cassette was loaded successfully and you just
finished a thoroughly enjoyable movie, the microcontroller may think the
mechanism is not safe and is not ejecting to protect your valuable tape from
possible damage should it not be fully retracted into the cassette.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.2 "Ejecting a cassette from an uncooperative VCR"

It is a common experience - the rental movie is due back at the video store
NOW but no matter how you press the EJECT button, yell, scream, hold your
breath, or jump up and down, the cassette refuses to be appear.

To remedy the underlying problem, see the sections on:
@{"Cassette loading and eject problems" link "7.1"} and other for appropriate information.
This section only deals with getting the cassette out without damaging either
your valuable recording or VCR.

Under no circumstances should you force anything - both your tape and your
VCR will be history.

First, see if the VCR just got into a confused state - pull the plug and
patiently wait a minute or two. This may reset the microcontroller and all
will be well. These things happen.

If this is not successful, you will need to open up the VCR (unplug it
first!) and attempt to cycle the mechanisms by hand. Probably both top and
bottom covers will need to be removed. The following procedures assume that
there are no broken parts, foreign objects, or other damage which might
prevent manual cycling of the tape loading and cassette loading mechanism.
(Inspect for toys and rocks.) Also note that some VCR designs use solenoids
to engage various operations. This will complicate your task (to put it
mildly) as locating and activating the proper ones at the appropriate time
is, well, a treat.

  1. Tape unloading: The first step is to determine if the tape has been
     unloaded from the video head drum back into the cassette. If the tape is
     fully retracted into the cassette - there is no tape showing, then go on
     to step (2). If not, you will need to figure out which shaft or pulley
     to turn to unload the tape. Trace the linkage or gears that move the
     roller guides back to their motor - it may be the main capstan motor or
     a separate small motor used only for this purpose. Rotate this in the
     direction which moves the roller guides back towards the cassette. It
     will take many revolutions - be persistent. If you feel any significant
     resistance or the roller guides move out toward the drum, turn the other
     way. The tape is fully unloaded when the roller guides are all the way
     into the cassette and the tape is straight across the cassette's
     stationary guideposts.

     If a single motor performs both the tape loading and cassette loading
     functions, stop turning as soon as you see the cassette start to rise
     and read the @{"next section" link "7.3"} before proceeding.

     If you are not fully successful or if there is still a tape loop outside
     the cassette even once you have been turning for what seems to be an
     eternity, you can still try to eject the cassette but will need to be
     extra careful not to crinkle the tape as the cassette door closes with
     the tape sticking out. Before proceeding on in this case, try to find a
     way to turn one of the reels to pull that tape back in as this will make
     your task a lot easier.

  2. Cassette unloading. Once the tape is fully retracted into the cassette,
     the cassette can be ejected safely. If a tape loop is still sticking out
     of the cassette - and you care about the recording - you will need to be
     especially careful not to crinkle the tape as the cassette door closes.
     It is usually not possible to get the cassette fully out without its
     door closing, so the best you can do is to make sure when this happens,
     the tape is flat across the gap. With care, it should survive.

     On a top loader, there is usually a solenoid specifically for EJECT or a
     simple mechanical pushbutton. Once the appropriate lever is pressed, the
     cassette should pop up - hold the basket with one hand as you do this to
     prevent any exposed tape loop from being crinkled.

     On a front loader, locate the cassette loading motor and begin turning
     it in the appropriate direction - this will be fairly obvious assuming
     there are no broken gear teeth or other broken parts and that something
     isn't totally jammed. If this is the main capstan motor, then just
     continue turning as in (1). Eventually the cassette should raise up and
     out.

     If you have a tape loop, be extra careful not to catch it on any
     guideposts or obstructions as you remove the cassette. Then, wind it
     back into the cassette by turning one of the reels (you may have to
     depress the release button on the bottom of the cassette with a pencil -
     this is the small hole in the center near the label side.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 7.3 "VCR is confused - will not eject non-existent tape"

If for some reason, the microcontroller gets confused and refuses to raise
the basket and there is no tape in the VCR, first, try pulling the plug for a
minute or two. This may reset the error condition. However, since the
mechanism is in an illegal state, the microcontroller may refuse to do
anything for fear of making things worse.

Assuming that the problem is still present, here are two suggestions:

   o Manually turn the appropriate motor shaft with power off to put the
     mechanism through the eject cycle. In many VCRs, this is as simple as
     turning the EJECT motor or possibly the main motor. Be patient and
     gentle - it will take a while.

     If there is some underlying problem which caused the basket to be
     lowered without a cassette in place, than the VCR may return to the
     illegal state, do nothing, or do something else that is peculiar once
     power is restored or any button is pressed.

   o Convince the microcontroller that a tape really is present when there is
     none. You need to (1) cover the start/end sensor LED poking up in the
     center of the deck, (2) depress any other microswitches that sense tape
     present, press EJECT, and (3) possibly turn the non-driven reel by hand
     a bit while it is attempting to wind the tape loop back into the
     cassette. Three or four hands are a definite asset. Make sure you get
     your fingers out before they are caught! Again, an underlying problem
     may produce unexpected results.

For additional info on initialization problems, see the section:
@{"VCR is failing the power-up sequence" link "10.6"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.1 "VCR will not fast forward and/or rewind"

Usually, the owner will admit that the machine is pre-Jurassic and has never
been cleaned or serviced.

Anyway, rule out the idler tire as well as the idler clutch - if it weakens,
then the idler wheel does not press against the appropriate reel with enough
force to grip.

Is it s top or front loader? If a top loader, you should be able to trick it
into playing a nonexistent tape by covering up the end-of-tape light (the one
sticking up in the middle) so that it will think there is a tape inserted.
(In some models, there might also be a microswitch.) This may permit you to
see what is going on.

If a front loader, then it is tougher. You need a cassette cheater (see the
section on @{"Cassette cheaters" link "5.4"}). Then, with the cheater in place happily
fooling the VCR, feel the spindles while the machine is operating. In FF or
REW, you may find that they are not being driven or or being driven very
weakly. Try to determine if the idler is even being pushed into position or
is hung up on something.

If there is any chance that it is the idler tire, try turning it inside-out.
The relatively protected inner (now outer) surface may grip well enough to
confirm the diagnosis.

Has it been serviced in the last 15 years? The last 100 years?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.2 "VCR aborts fast forward or rewind"

In this case, the tape starts to move - possibly at a reasonable speed - but
then may shut down - possibly erratic or tape dependent.

Make sure the tape is not the problem - try another one.

If it starts the operation (as evidenced by whirring sounds and the tape
counter changing numbers) but at some point - perhaps near the end of the
tape - aborts and shuts down, then a worn idler tire, worn or broken idler
clutch, bad belt, or lubrication problem is likely. See the section:
@{"VCR will not fast forward or rewind" link "8.1"} as well as @{"Lubricating a VCR" link "6.4"}

With instant start transports - where the tape is maintained around the video
head drum for all but the fastest rewind, there could be other control
problems as well.

If the tape starts fast forwarding or rewinding properly (from a visual
inspection with the cover off) but the tape counter does not change value and
then the unit shuts down, a reel rotation sensor problem is likely. See the
section: @{"Reel rotation sensors" link "20.4"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 8.3 "Tape rewinders"

Should you buy a tape rewinder to save wear and tear on your VCR? Take it or
leave it. I think they are good if your VCR is old and for whatever reason
has trouble with FF or REW. However, sluggish FF or REW may be a precursor to
tape eating and should be addressed to avoid an impending failure which may
ruin a tape. Rubber parts deteriorate by just existing. The surface layer
oxidizes and use may actually be good (don't quote me!). I would not bother
with a rewinder just to prevent wear and tear on the motors or heads. In many
VCRs - particularly older VCRs without real-time tape counters, the tape is
totally retracted into the cassette during high speed FF or REW and does not
contact the heads at all. In newer VCRs with real-time counters, the tape
will contact the control head lightly but wear should not worth worrying
about. Wear and tear on the motors is not a serious problem - much less than
playing a tape. If the convenience of being able to rewind off-line is
important to you, then there may be no harm in using one. However, some
rewinders can be hard on video tapes as they usually do not sense the clear
leader but stop rewinding when the tape tension increases at the end of the
tape. This may eventually damage the tape and/or pull the tape from the
takeup reel hub. I have heard of some actually mangling tapes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.1 "VCR refuses to record"

If efforts to record (directly or via the timer) are totally ignored or cause
the cassette to be ejected, then the record protect tab on the cassette may
be broken off or the record protect sense switch in the VCR may be dirty or
defective. This switch sits just under the cassette slot (on front loaders).
Locate it by referencing the tab position on the loaded cassette. It can
easily be tested with an ohmmeter - if you can get to it. To confirm, short
out or disconnect (which you will need to do depends on the design of your
VCR) the appropriate wires (maybe there is a connector - this could have bad
contacts as well) and see if the VCR is more cooperative.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.2 "VCR aborts play or record during startup or shortly thereafter"

This is a problem with the process called 'tape loading' - pulling the tape
loop out of the cassette and wrapping it around the spinning video drum,
engaging the capstan and pinch roller and reel rotation.

Check all the belts above and below the deck. Belts can appear to be firm but
if they do not return immediately to their relaxed length when you stretch
them 25%, they will need to be replaced.

With the cover off, observe the behavior when you hit play. (You may need to
put a piece of cardboard over the cassette to block external light from
interfering with the start/end tape sensors). Assuming this is a basic VCR
(no instant start features), you should see:

  1. The video head drum begins to spin.

  2. The roller guides move smoothly on the tracks, wind the tape around the
     drum, and stop snuggly pressed against the 'V-stopper' at the end of the
     tracks.

  3. The pinch roller moves into position and presses the tape against the
     capstan.

  4. The tape begins to move and is wound up by the takeup reel.

  5. The picture and sound appear on the TV.

With a 'rapid or quick start' (or it may be called something else) transport,
the tape moves to a half-loaded position when the cassette is inserted. This
is at an intermediate position partially pulled out of the cassette but not
wrapped around the drum. On VCRs with a real-time counter and/or index search
capabilities, the tape will be in contact with the control head.

With an 'instant start' transport, the tape will fully load around the
spinning drum when the cassette is inserted but the capstan will not engage
and no tension will be applied to the tape until you press PLAY or REC.
(After about 5 minutes, the drum will stop and it may unload to the half
loaded or unloaded position.)

Note that for VCRs with a real-time counter and/or index search capabilities,
the tape must be in contact with the control head (but not the video heads)
for all relevant modes. These VCRs (which include many modern units) must
therefore pull the tape at least partly out of the cassette.

In all cases, the completion of the sequence results in approximately the
same mechanical configuration during PLAY.

Several likely possibilities when it shuts down:

  1. Everything occurs as above, picture and sound appear for a few seconds,
     but then the VCR unloads the tape, ejects the cassette, goes into REW
     mode, stops, or shuts off. Two common causes:

     The takeup reel does not turn and tape spills into the machine. This is
     sensed by the microcontroller which aborts record or play and attempts
     to save your valuable cassette. Most likely cause: old/dirty idler tire.
     As a test, turn the idler tire inside-out. The fresh surface will now
     work well enough to confirm this diagnosis and will continue working
     long enough for your replacement idler tire to arrive. See the section:
     @{"General guide to VCR cleaning and rubber parts replacement" link "6.3"}

     The takeup reel is turning properly but one of the reel rotation sensors
     or its electronics is defective. As a test, check to see if the tape
     counter is changing at any time during the loading and abort process.
     Non-real time tape counters usually get their pulses from this same
     sensor. (Real time counters operate off of the A/C head control pulses
     and therefore would not be affected by a defective reel sensor). Some
     older VCRs used a belt driven counter - the belt may have broken or
     fallen off. Most newer VCRs use an optical sensor which may simply be
     dirty. See the section on: @{"Reel rotation sensors" link "20.4"}

  2. The roller guides are getting hung up and not fully loading the tape
     either as a result of an obstruction or dried up grease, or a slipping
     tape loading belt (often accompanied by an spine tingling squeal). Parts
     may have broken or fallen off of the roller guide assemblies preventing
     them from fully engaging the 'V-stoppers'. A similar fault may prevent
     the capstan from fully engaging against the tape and pinch roller.

  3. The mode switch sensor is dirty or defective and confusing the poor
     microcomputer as to the position of the loading mechanism. In this case,
     the loading process may stop half way, pause, and then unload as in (1)
     or (2), above. Or, it may do almost anything. See the section on:
     @{"Erratic behavior in various modes" link "10.2"}

  4. Some other condition such as the end-of-tape sensor thinking that you
     are at the end of the tape is aborting the tape loading process. This
     might be indicated by a sudden reversal and shutdown rather than a pause
     (usually accompanied by the sound of a motor whirring) at some point
     attempting to complete part of the cycle. For problems with record in
     particular, the record protect tab switch may be dirty or worn resulting
     in random aborts.

  5. Electronic problems like bad grounds or other bad connections are alos
     possible. Since with some models, (a number of JVC manufactured VCRs,
     for example) ground integrity is via screws through the mainboard,
     should these loosen, erratic behavior may result. Tighten the screws.

  6. A defective microcontroller or other logic could also be at fault but
     this is less likely than any of the preceding.

@endnode
@node 9.3 "VCR aborts play or record at random times or near end of tape"

In this case, the VCR starts to play or record but, say, an hour later, shuts
down for no good reason - at least not as a result of a command you thought
you issued.

Make sure the tape is not the problem - try another one.

Confirm that you are using the proper play or record modes - not OTR (One
Time Record) or other timed play or record modes which will likely operate in
increments of 15 minutes depending on how many times you press the button. In
addition, on certain VCRs, if the program timer is enabled with a program
setting that has its stop time occur while you are using the VCR - even if
the record operation has been aborted by pressing the stop button - the VCR
will shut down.

Finally, make sure you are not using any 'insert editing' modes which require
a previously laid down control track and would abort once blank tape was
reached. See the section: @{"Recording stops at random times on previously used tapes" link "11.4"}

Once all the obvious problems and cockpit errors have been eliminated,
mechanical problem still likely even though the VCR does not abort
immediately. A worn idler tire, worn or defective idler clutch, bad belt, or
improperly adjusted backtension, are all possibilities.

This is particularly likely if the problem is more likely to occur or only
happens near the end of tapes as the required takeup reel torque is greater
and any of the above mechanical problems will be exacerbated.

With instant start transports - where the tape is maintained around the video
head drum for all but the fastest rewind, there could be other control
problems as well.

If the operation starts properly (as indicated by a changing picture on the
TV in play or from a visual inspection with the cover off) but the tape
counter does not change value and then the unit shuts down, a reel rotation
sensor problem is likely. See the section: @{"Reel rotation sensors" link "20.4"}

This could still be due to problems similar to those which cause an immediate
abort if some components or connections are marginal. Also see the section:
@{"VCR aborts play or record during startup or shortly thereafter" link "9.2"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.4 "VCR eats tapes"

The most common cause of a VCR eating tapes is a dirty/worn idler tire
preventing the takeup reel from turning. See section on
@{"General guide to VCR cleaning and rubber parts replacement" link "6.3"} The idler tire
transfers motor power to the appropriate reel hub. If dirty, worn, dried out,
glazed, cracked, or otherwise deteriorated, it will slip and cause the takeup
reel (in play mode) to stop turning at some point. Hopefully, the microcomputer
senses this and tries to wind the tape back into the cassette. But, you guessed
it, this requires the idler tire so you end up with a mess of tape inside the
machine.  When you go to eject, you may get the cassette with a tape loop
hanging out.  If you are careful, you may be able to extract the tape without
crinkling it too badly but don't just pull - it will break or be hopeless
damaged. You will need to remove the top cover and carefully lift the tape loop
out of the machine and wind it back into the cassette. If there is any
significant crinkling or a partial break in the tape, discard the cassette.
If it is priceless and irreplaceable, see the section:
@{"Recovering damaged or broken tapes" link "16.5"} DO NOT try to use it or just return it to the video store without
informing them of what happened - it is unfair to the next renter as a badly
crinkled or partially broken tape can destroy expensive video heads.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.5 "Tape loop hanging from cassette when ejected after play or record"

(This may also apply to other modes for a VCR with a 'quick start' or
'instant start' transport.)

If your VCR aborts playing unexpectedly and shuts down and then, pushing
EJECT results in a tape loop hanging out of the cassette when it is removed,
this is considered tape eating - refer to the section: @{"VCR eats tapes" link "9.4"}
However, if all other functions work normally but ejecting results in a tape
loop, this section is for you.

Using a garbage cassette, try to observe exactly what is happening during
EJECT. Specifically, is the operation terminating early or is there some
problem with the appropriate reel not turning or not turning reliably or
quickly enough? Is the tape getting hung up on the roller guides or on some
other guideposts?

As with tape eating, the most common cause is dirty, old, deteriorated rubber
parts - particularly the idler tire - preventing the tape from being fully
wound back into the cassette. Therefore, the first step is to follow the
procedures in the section @{"General guide to VCR cleaning and rubber parts replacement" link "6.3"}

If this only started happening after you had the VCR apart for any reason,
recheck your work - you may have neglected a connector, have the mode switch
slightly out of position, or have gears which are improperly timed.

Many VCRs determine that the tape is completely wound back into the cassette
by sensing rotation of the non-driven reel indicating that the tape is
pulling on it as a result of being tight and pulled by the driven reel. If
this sensor is defective, disconnected, the signal is noisy, or the
associated electronics are faulty, the operation may be terminating early. As
an experiment to confirm this, use a cassette cheater and while the VCR
thinks it is winding the tape back into the cassette, turn the non-driven
spindle by hand - this should stop the operation instantly. If it stops too
quickly - before you turn the spindle, there could be a problem with this
sensor. It is also possible for a failure of one of the reel brakes to allow
one of the reels to continue spinning even after motor power has been shut
off. Alternatively, a sticky brake band may increase the driven reel torque
and fool the microcontroller into thinking that the tape slack has been taken
up.

If the roller guides get hung up on the tracks while being retracted, even
for an instant, the tape may become tight around the roller guides, pull on
the non-driven reel, and stop the operation before the tape is fully wound
back into the cassette. Check for obstructions and for adequate lubrication
of the roller guide tracks.

If it is a late model Sony, the 'half loading arm' could need lubrication.
See the section: @{"Late model Sony VCR munches tape on eject" link "17.4"}

@node 9.6 "Tape sticks to head drum"

(From: Daniel Schoo)

This seems to happen mostly on machines with a lot of play time. There is
supposed to be an air film between the tape and drum to facilitate the
reduction of friction. When the drum gets worn and polished the air is
squeezed out and the tape sticks. Little can be done for this. You could
replace the drum but this is expensive and not worth the effort for most
machines. The other option is to try and rough up the drum surface by light
sanding with scotchbrite. I don't need to go into detail about how difficult
this is to do correctly but what the heck you don't have anything to loose.
Just be careful and stay clear of the heads. BTW I have seen "cleaning" tapes
that rough up the drums very well!

Picture jittering vertically may be similar problem. Tape is not moving
smoothly over the head drum.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 9.7 "Video head drum stops or slows during play or record"

Check whether the backtension on the tape is applying so much pressure to the
drum that it is slowing it down. Backtension should be just enough to keep
the tape in good contact with the drum. If it is too tight, then you
backtension felt may be worn or adjusted too high. There is a lever just as
the tape exits the cassette - push this to the right to reduce tension.
Someone may have attempted to repair a broken backtension band and reduced
its length - I got a VCR for repair once where this was done.

If it is not the backtension, check free rotation of the drum when it stops -
I bet it turns as freely as always. Could be a part in the motor driver that
is faulty and failing when hot. However, the bearing could be worn or dry
which would require disassembly and lubrication or replacement of the lower
cylinder (assuming this is where the drum bearings are located).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.1 "VCR is alive but will not do anything"

Typical symptoms: front panel display is active, it may be possible to set
the clock or timer and change channels, but all transport related buttons are
totally inert. It is likely that the VCR refuses to accept a cassette as
well.

This could mean many things including motor problems as well as a general
power supply or control system failure. However, here are a couple of things
to try first:

  1. Cycle power - unplug the VCR from the wall (don't just use its power
     switch) for a minute or two to see if the microcontroller simply got
     into a confused state. This is more common than you would think. A
     random power surge can do it. The VCR may have gotten into a bad
     (mechanical or electrical) state.

  2. Unplug the VCR and remove the covers. Rotate the shafts of each of the
     motors (cassette loading and tape loading or main motors depending on
     your VCR) clockwise a couple of turns (assuming there is no resistance
     to turning). Plug it in and listen for initialization sounds - it should
     detect that the mechanism has been moved and then reset to a safe
     position. See if it is now behaving.

  3. If (2) doesn't do anything, try several turns counterclockwise instead.

  4. If still no improvement, there may be more serious power supply, motor,
     or control system problems.

If any of these appears to solve the problem, it is quite possible that you
will never experience it again. However, a dirty mode switch (see the
section: @{"VCR mode (sensor) switches" link "10.3"} may have resulted in an overshoot to a
bad mechanical state and without cleaning or replacement, the same thing may
happen again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.2 "Erratic behavior in various modes"

You press PLAY and the VCR gets halfway through loading the tape and suddenly
aborts and shuts down. Or, you put a cassette in and it is immediately spit
out as though it tasted bad to the VCR. Or, you press PLAY and the VCR goes
into REWIND mode. Or, you pressed REVIEW and it ejected or attempted to eject
the cassette.

Before you break out the screwdriver or shotgun, cover up the IR remote
sensor and cassette slot. Some types of electronic ballasted fluorescent
lights may confuse the remote control receiver. Or, someone or something may
be sitting on the remote hand unit or it may be defective and continuously
issuing a REW command! Excessive general illumination may even make its way
into the tape start and/or end sensors and trick the VCR into thinking the
tape is at one end.

Assuming neither of these is the source of the problem:

First, eliminate the possible mechanical causes such as slipping belts or a
bad idler tire which could prevent the VCR from completing your requested
action - it then shuts down or attempts to return to a 'safe' position.

Bad connections are a possibility but not as likely as in a TV or monitor,
for example. However, some VCRs (certain JVCs and clones, for example) ground
parts of the circuitry via the circuit board mounting screws and simply
tightening these are all that is needed to affect a cure.

The microcomputer or its associated circuitry could be defective as well -
but this is not as common most people fear.

Occasionally, a faulty power supply may result in similar behavior. Its
output voltages may be marginal, drop under load, or have excessive ripple
due to dried up filter capacitors.

However, a more likely possibility than any of the above is that a sensor
assembly present on most VCRs called the 'Mode Switch' or 'Mode Sensor' is
dirty or bad. See the section: @{"VCR mode (sensor) switches" link "10.3"} Failure of the
Mode Switch is a very common problem with numerous VCRs of many makes and
models.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.3 "VCR mode (sensor) switches"

In order for the microcontroller in a VCR to confirm correct functioning and
completion of various operations like cassette and tape loading and roller
guide position, some mechanical sensor feedback is normally used. The most
important sensor assembly in most VCRs is called the 'Mode Switch' or 'Mode
Sensor'. The purpose of the Mode Switch is to inform the microcontroller of
the gross position of the mechanism at all times. For example, the mode
switch may have 5 positions:

  1. Tape unloaded and cassette out.
  2. Tape unloaded and cassette in.
  3. Tape half loaded against A/C head but not around drum.
  4. Tape fully loaded around drum and roller guides at V-stoppers.
  5. Pinch roller pressed against capstan - play/record position.

The microcomputer monitors the outputs of the Mode Switch continuously when
it is executing a mechanical operation (some monitor it at all times even
with power 'off'). If an operation takes too long to move from state to state
or an incorrect state transition occurs, the operation will be aborted and an
attempt - possibly several - will be made to return the transport to a 'safe'
position - unloading the tape and possibly ejecting the cassette.

If the Mode Switch contacts are dirty or worn, or if it has somehow loosened
on its mountings and shifted slightly, one or more of these positions will
report back incorrectly or erratically signaling an error condition. For
example, a transition from state 1 to state 4 directly would totally confuse
the poor controller. A Mode Switch that shifted out of place (or where other
timing relationships in the VCR are messed up) might result in certain
operations stopping at the wrong position as well. For example, if the Mode
Switch shifts one way, the pinch roller may never quite press against the
capstan or the roller guides may not snuggle up to the V-stoppers as they
should in play mode. If it shifts the other way, operations may fail to
complete and run against the mechanical stops - stripped or broken gears may
even the result.

Mode Switches are usually linear or rotary slide switches with 4 or more
output terminals. They may or may not be easily accessible. On some, they are
visible once the bottom cover is removed. On others, they are buried beneath
a bunch of mechanical doohickies (technical term). Some are removable with a
screw or two and a connector. Others require desoldering and the removal of a
whole lot of stuff - all of which must be carefully replaced with exactly the
same timing relationships - just to gain access.

Once, you get at them, you can often snap apart the housing and use contact
cleaner on the sliding contacts and surfaces. I usually do not use any kind
of lubricant as it can gum up on the contact surfaces resulting in erratic
outputs - possibly the cause of the original problems in the first place.
Some may not come apart and replacement is the only option if squirting
contact cleaner through any visible openings does not help. Sometimes, bad
solder connections to the mode switch are the only problem.

However, be very careful about not moving anything and take careful notes on
the position of any parts that you disconnect as critical timing
relationships are controlled by the gear positions. Stripped gears or other
broken parts may result when the mechanism cycles. Also, in certain
positions, levers or sliders operated by the mechanism you remove may spring
out of position and you will need to make sure they get put back into the
correct slots in any cams when you are done. Mark all gear positions even if
they do not seem to be critical. See the section below on "How not to mess up
your day my ignoring timing marks" or more simply:
@{"Mechanical relationships in VCRs" link "10.4"}

Note that if you experience erratic behavior with a VCR manufactured by
Sharp, the probability of a dirty mode switch is very close to 1.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.4 "Mechanical relationships in VCRs"

The complexity of the mechanism in a VCR can be quite intimidating. To avoid
total frustration and really messing up your day, before you remove anything
mechanical, take careful notes of precise relationships of any gear, lever,
switch, anything that might possibly get back together in an ambiguous way.
Often there are 'timing' marks on the gears just as you would find in a
lawnmower or automobile engine. These will be little arrows or holes which
will line up with stationary marks or with each other on adjacent gears when
the mechanism is in a particular position. Often, it is best to put the
mechanism in the position where the timing marks line up because there may be
fewer levers, cams, etc. which are under pressure or tension in this position
and thus fewer things to pop out at you. If there are no apparent timing
marks, make your own with a scribe or pen. Sometimes mechanisms that at first
appear not to be critical are obscured in such a way that they really control
critical timing. So, when in doubt, make more notes than necessary - with
diagrams.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.5 "VCR does not work after cassette was forcibly removed"

You were watching your favorite tape and suddenly the VCR emits a mechanical
eek and is now dead - or you press eject and the VCR shuts down without
regurgitating your tape. Worse yet, someone (we will not point fingers)
forcibly removed the tape to return it to the video store.

Assuming that 'forcibly' does not mean that permanent damage was done, then
the first place, as always, to check is the idler tire and then all other
rubber belts. At this point it is hard to say whether your problem was
compounded by the removal of the tape. If any gears were shifted with respect
to one another, parts bent, or springs sprung, then without a service manual,
it would be difficult for a technician let alone someone not familiar with
your VCR to repair it.

An error at power on usually means that the microcomputer thinks that it is
unable to put the mechanism into a 'safe' position. This could be due to
slipping belts, broken gears, a bad motor, shifted sensors, or faulty
electronics. The original symptoms may have been a slipping idler preventing
the takeup reel from rotating allowing tape to spill into the machine. Power
on problems may be more serious. See the section on
@{"VCR is failing the Power-up sequence" link "10.6"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.6 "The VCR is failing the power-up sequence"

This often means that the internal microcomputer found the mechanism in an
unusual state and was unable to reset it. Some VCRs will actually move
portions of the mechanism to make sure that everything is ok to accept a
tape. Failure here may be the result of a slipping or broken belt or a belt
that has popped off of its pulleys, gummed up lubrication, or some other
mechanical fault. How old is it? Rubber parts tend to become smooth and lose
their elastic properties ('rubberiness') after a few years. Does the VCR make
any kind of whirring sounds before shutting down? This would mean that it is
attempting to move something back into position. Is there a tape in the
machine? How about a toy, peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or a little
applesauce? It could be a sensor or other electronic problem, but check out
the mechanical possibilities first.

On a VCR which has been cleaned and with good rubber parts:

VCRs have a light or LED (IR, infrared) in the middle of the mechanical
assembly that detects the end of tape. When a tape is loaded the tape will
cover the sensor. The controller can tell if the tape is at the beginning,
middle, or end by the sensor. The is achieved by a clear leader at the
beginning and end of the tape. The microcontroller will detect a problem if
the sensors do not detect the light or LED (middle of tape) and the carriage
assembly is up (no tape loaded). The VCR will shut down.

  1. If you have an incandescent light and it is not lit, it is burned out.
     If you have the LED type you can buy an IR tester from an electronic
     parts supplier or construct one as described at the end of this
     document. Replacement LEDs are readily available.

  2. The VCR might be in a confused state. Many VCRs have a belt that drives
     a loading motor. This is the motor that drives the tape around the
     heads. If those guides are not fully retracted, the VCR shuts down.
     Check the belt and replace if necessary.

  3. Ensure the tape guide assembly is fully retracted by physically turning
     the appropriate gears.

  4. Some obstruction is preventing part of the mechanism from resetting.
     Visually inspect for foreign objects or rough edges on something
     preventing full movement. Dried up grease can also cause this.

  5. A gear has slipped a tooth and one part of the mechanism does not track
     another. This may happen if a tape was forcefully ejected after being
     eaten. You may find that a tooth has actually broken off.

  6. If this occurred after having disassembled part of the mechanism,
     confirm the timing relationships. Make sure belts are installed in the
     correct locations - and on the correct sides of any intermediate pulleys
     where belts link more than two pulleys.

Without a service manual, determining the correct relationships for all gears
may be impossible, but if only one has slipped you may be able to locate
timing marks near the edges of the gears which should line up - usually when
the tape is unloaded. (portions from michael@marconi.nsc.com)

@node 10.7 "VCR displays DEW warning"

Your VCR has worked fine for several years but now you get the 'DEW' warning
in the display and no tape functions work.

The dew sensor is intended to prevent operation of the tape transport if the
humidity is so high that moisture would build up and cause the video tape to
stick to the rotating drum and damage the heads or get hopeless tangled as a
result.

First, perhaps the dew warning is telling the truth. If you have just moved
the VCR from a cold area to a warm one, let it sit for an hour or so and see
if the dew warning goes away. If you just fished it out of the toilet or
scraped stewed peaches from the interior, well, dew may be the least of your
problems.

Assuming that there is no reason for a dew warning, the dew sensor may be bad
or have changed value. There may or may not be an adjustment for this.

Before you go inside, try unplugging the VCR to clear any spontaneous fault
condition - see the section on: @{"VCR goes whacko" link "10.10"}

The dew sensor is a resistor that changes value when there is condensation.
If the sensor is bad, you should be able to replace it with a resistor and
keep the VCR happy. You should be able to determine the appropriate
resistance by trial and error. If it is the type where the resistance
decreases with moisture and the controller does not care if the resistance is
too high, then you can just remove it. Either way, you have now lost the
protection that the dew sensor provides. Replacement is obviously best.

Don't overlook the possibility of a bad connection - it may be plugged in and
just need to be reseated.

One type looks like a ceramic board, maybe 1/4" - 1/2" on a side with a
silver/gray printed circuit pattern.

If the A/D or whatever is used to determine when there is dew is faulty, then
you will most likely need a service manual to troubleshoot it.

@node 10.8 "VCR shows LOCKED in the display"

You go and try to play a tape and the VCR displays the word 'LOCKED' or
perhaps just a flashing 'L' in the display.

This may mean that the VCR has somehow been programmed to prevent use by
unauthorized kids (you are not reading this if you are a kid, right?) Even if
your model does not have this feature, the same basic chassis is probably
used for a range of models so it could have gotten into a confused state.

   o Sometimes, just pressing the PLAY (or other more obscure) button on the
     remote control (it may be designed not to work from the front panel) for
     10-20 seconds will clear this mode.

   o Unplugging the VCR for a minute or two may work. Unplugging for long
     enough to drain the backup battery will probably work but you may then
     need to reinitialize the clock, channel selection, and programming.

   o Best bet is to check your instruction manual (you can locate your user

@node 10.9 "VCRs with Alzheimer's Disease"

Suppose your just-out-warranty VCR is now acting up for no apparent reason -
making strange sounds, forgetting its programming, refusing to cooperate,
etc.

I don't know what kind of recourse you may have as an unsatisfied consumer,
but I would try to get some resolution through your place of purchase. Such a
VCR has all the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease - it should not be failing in
these ways so early in life unless it is under penalty of hard labor in the
damp snake infested dungeon of an English castle! Or it has been the
depository for peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches, applesauce, or marbles!

All the usual recommendations of cleaning and checking rubber parts and so
forth apply to units that have seen significant use or are a few years old or
both. Something this new under normal use should not be causing this amount
of grief. However, sometime I wonder whether using a machine very little
contributes to problems.

First try your place of purchase - there may still be some degree of interest
in maintaining customer satisfaction.

If you have given up on the store, start by checking the rubber parts for
dust and deterioration (with that kind of use, dirt should not be a problem,
but dust or smoke can accumulate), check for adequate lubrication (but don't
add any unless it is definitely needed and then only the smallest amount -
VCRs do not need much oil or grease and too much will just compound your
problems - and check for foreign objects especially if there are small kids
about.

@endnode
@node 10.10 "VCR has gone whacko"

You may think you are on the set of the latest sci-fi movie. The VCR displays
are counting at random, pushing buttons produce unexpected results, motors
may be spinning, or the VCR may be repeatedly loading and unloading a
non-existent tape. I may be attempting to play a tape even without you
pressing any buttons.

While these could be symptoms of a actual problem, first try unplugging the
VCR from the wall outlet (don't just turn it off) for a minute or so.

If this does not help, try unplugging for a couple of hours - this will
usually drain the backup battery and reset many other functions of the VCR.

If one of these techniques results in the universe returning to normal, there
may have been a power surge or lightening strike nearby which threw the
microcontroller into a confused state. It may never happen again. However,
power surges can be the result of heavy appliances like air conditioners on
the same circuit. If this is the case, you should consider using a different
circuit for your electronic equipment.

If this behavior started when the VCR was just plugged in or following some
other action requiring the mechanism to move or initialize, check for
mechanical problems like a broken belt or one that has popped off its pulleys
or an obstruction like a rock or toy that is preventing the VCR from
completing the required motions. Also see the section:
@{"VCR is failing the power-up sequence" link "10.6"}

Once you have ruled out mechanical problems, it is likely that the VCR has a
microcontroller, power supply, or other electronic problem which may require
professional service.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 10.11 "VCR forgets settings following power failure"

Normally, the AC line provides power to retain the clock, active channels,
and programming settings. During a power failure, the clock and programming
is usually powered using a supercap or battery (usually rechargeable).
Channel settings for older style varactor type tuners were often stored in
some kind of non-volatile memory while active channels for quartz tuners
generally use battery backup.

The clock and programming backup may be a supercap - a very high value
special electrolytic capacitor - as much a 1 F (1,000,000 uF) at 5-12 V.
Alternatively, it may use a rechargeable NiCd battery. In either case, these
are easily replaceable with standard parts. A NiCd battery pack of similar
ratings should be readily available. Supercaps are available from large
electronics distributors.

NiCd batteries fail in two ways - loss of capacity or shorted cells. If
memory is retained for a much shorter time than it used to, then the battery
has probably lost most of its capacity. If you measure less than n x 1.2 V
for an n cell NiCd battery pack after it has been charging for awhile, there
is likely a shorted cell. In either case, the best solution is a replacement
though the various common techniques for rejuvenating NiCd battery packs can
be attempted (remove from VCR first!).

The non-volatile memory could use a special chip like EEPROM which does not
require power or a battery backed SRAM or be internal to one of the VCR's
microcontrollers. Channel memory may use a separate power source from the
clock and programming, possibly a Lithium battery since it is undesirable for
the channel settings to be forgotten even if the VCR is unplugged for a month
or more as it is such a pain to reinitialize them. Rechargeable batteries
have too high a self discharge rate.

@endnode
@node 11.1 "VCR randomly switches speeds, tracking problems, and muddy sound"

First, don't ignore the possibility that you are attempting to play an old,
worn, or defective tape. This is especially true of rental tapes which have
been through who knows what kind of VCR hell. The control and audio tracks -
along the edges of the tape - are the first to wear. Weak muddy sound and
erratic tracking are also common symptoms caused by old worn tapes.

Assuming you are having the same problem on multiple tapes:

This is an indication that your tape path alignment is off or your rubber
parts (probably the pinch roller) need replacing. The tape is wandering up
and down as a result of unequal pull from the capstan due to a glazed/worn
pinch roller. There could also be other aspects of tape path alignment like
roller guide tilt (which is probably not adjustable), A/C head tilt, dirt,
roller guide height (don't mess with it), etc. See the section on
@{"tape path alignment" link "19"} It could also be worn feet on the roller guide assemblies
causing the guides to not be perfectly vertical - replacement of these parts
may be the only cure. Other much less likely possibilities: excessive or
varying backtension, tight idler clutch, electronic problems.

Another related symptom is that the sound does not always appear at full
volume or normal quality for a few seconds after the VCR starts playing. It
may vary in loudness during play as well. Slightly changing backtension may
make a big difference in audio.

If you look carefully, you should be able to see the tape wandering slightly
producing the muddy sound and erratic tracking. The tape may not be perfectly
smooth in passing over the various guides and rollers. Normally, you will
almost not be able to tell the tape is moving at all except by examining the
reel rotation - it is that mirror smooth.

First, clean the tape path properly, especially the capstan and pinch roller,
tape guides, A/C head. Inspect the pinch roller for glazing, cracking, etc.
and replace if necessary. See the sections on @{"cleaning" link "6.3"} and @{"tape path alignment" link "19"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 11.2 "VCR plays but at fast forward speed (or beyond)"

Normally, speed is controlled via phase locking the capstan to the (approx.)
30 Hz control pulses read off of the tape via the stationary audio/control
head. Possible causes for loss of lock:

  1. Dirt or bits of tape or oxide on control head - clean and inspect.

  2. Defective control head. Try making a recording. If recording plays
     normally on another VCR, then control head is probably ok.

  3. Tape wandering up and down so that control track is not sensed properly
     (how is the sound - this would also cause fluctuating or missing sound.)
     See the section
     @{"VCR randomly switches speeds, tracking problems, and muddy sound" link "11.1"}

  4. Mechanical fault preventing firm tape-control head contact such as a
     stuck movable guide post.

  5. Mechanical or mode switch problem preventing firm capstan-pinch roller
     contact. Under certain conditions - possibly at the beginning of a tape
     when takeup tension is greatest - the takeup reel may have enough torque
     to pull the tape past the video heads without the capstan controlling
     the speed as it should.

  6. Defect in servo or control circuitry or power supply (voltage out of
     tolerance).

  7. Bad tape. Don't overlook this possibility especially if it is a old or
     rental tape. The control track may have gotten erased or warn off - it
     is at the edge of the tape. Try another tape.

Inspect the tape path really really carefully to determine if there is some
obstruction preventing tape-control head contact or other mechanical
problems.  Try cleaning the tape path and checking the rubber parts. Check
power supply voltages if you can determine what they should be (see the
section on @{"VCR power supplies" link "15.3"} If these procedures to not reveal anything
amiss, you will need a service manual to pursue electronic faults.

@endnode
@node 11.3 "Tape edge gets creased and/or random switching between speeds"

As always, rule out the possibility that this is just a bad tape. It could
have been creased by someone else's VCR. Try a tape you can afford to
sacrifice (though it will still be safely usable) and run it through the VCR.
Sometimes, there will be a problem only near one end so you will need to try
it at various sections of tape. Record a few minutes and then back it up a
bit and inspect for damage by opening the cassette door (press the release on
the side). Both edges should be perfectly flat and smooth. If you get similar
playback symptoms with this cassette and/or find that the tape is being
creased along one or both edges, then it is your VCR doing the dirty work.

When the bottom of the tape gets creased, the control head may no longer
align with the control track and you loose servo lock on the sync signal.
Your audio may be fluctuating in intensity as well since the audio track is
wandering also and the tape may be intermittently going in and out of correct
tracking and/or changing speeds.

It could be the guide posts or other tape path components, but before you
turn every screw you can find and make the problems hopelessly worse, replace
all of the rubber parts - belts, idler tire, pinch roller. And while you are
at it, give the machine a good cleaning.

If you want to do this before buying the new rubber (which BTW should not be
more than a total $10-$15 from a place like MCM Electronics), you may at
least see a temporary improvement in performance.

You really need to determine exactly where the tape is being creased. Once
you do this, you may be able to determine the cause and visually verify
whether the problem is affected by any of your adjustments or probing.

Some possibilities are:

   o Worn feet on the roller guides causing them to not be precisely
     vertical. Sometimes there are adjustments for tilt; usually there are
     none. Sometimes replacements are readily available (especially if this
     is a common problem with your model).

   o Cassette not seating properly. Press down on cassette while playing a
     known good tape. If it moves, then check for obstructions or foreign
     objects such as toys or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches! A dirty,
     oily, or just tired belt may not grip well enough for the mechanism to
     complete the cassette load cycle.

   o Various guides too high or too low but this is pretty unlikely unless
     they have loosened somehow. Don't adjust unless you have a service
     manual or are absolutely sure that they have changed height.

   o Backtension misadjusted. If the tape passes around the backtension lever
     at too straight an angle (it doesn't bend enough), in addition to the
     possible incorrect backtension, it may simply not seat properly when
     passing around the subsequent guidepost or impedance roller.

@endnode
@node 11.4 "Recording stops at random times on previously used tapes"

Symptoms may be that the tape counter stops moving and/or the VCR enters stop
mode and shuts down. Assuming this is not a mechanical problem - bad idler,
belt, etc., make sure you don't accidentally have an 'insert editing' mode
enabled. Insert editing uses the previously laid down control track as the
timing reference. This provides clean glitch-free transitions between scenes.
Insert editing will not work at all on a new or bulk erased tape. If you
routinely use your cassettes over and over, there will be varying amounts of
previously recorded material - with control tracks - on the tapes. At some
point your recording may start to use tape beyond the recorded sections and -
presto, no more control track. Poor VCR is confused and aborts.

@endnode
@node 11.5 "Record (or play) stops after 15 minutes (or 30 minutes, etc.)"

Make sure you are using the proper record button. Most VCRs have a OTR (One

stops after a multiple of (usually) 15 minutes depending on how many times
you press the button. The (normally) red button should be used for
unrestricted untimed recordings.

Some VCRs also have other timed modes - sort of like the timed off function
of a clock radio. Pressing the 'Off-T' button adds time to record or play in
15 minute increments and then the VCR shuts off.

@endnode
@node 12.1 "Video playback problems"

If the VCR works in all respects when tuning broadcast or cable channels but
playing a tape results in no picture, a very snowy picture, or just a blue
screen, there may be problems with the video heads, the lower cylinder, head
preamps, or other video electronics. Testing most of these is beyond the
scope of this document and will require a service manual and test equipment.
However, you can do a decent job of determining if the video heads are likely
to be at fault.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.2 "Video record problems"

If attempting to record results in unexpected behavior, there could be a
variety of causes depending on what you get for playback:

   o Attempts to record are ignored by the VCR or cause the cassette to be
     ejected. This may mean the the record protect tab on the cassette is
     broken off or the record tab sense switch is dirty or bad.

   o Playback results in video snow. This means that the old recording is
     being erased (if there was one) but nothing or too weak a signal is
     being written by the video heads. This could be dues a variety of
     electronic faults as well as marginal or bad video heads.

   o Playback results in a picture but it has a wiggling rainbow pattern
     running through it. This is normal at the start of a recording made on
     top of an old recording if your VCR does not have a flying erase head.
     However, it should wipe down the screen in a few seconds and disappear.
     If it does not, then your full width erase head is not working.

   o Playback results in a flickering picture alternating between good video
     and snow at the frame rate (about 30 Hz for NTSC). This could mean that
     one of the heads used for record is dirty or defective.

   o Playback results in proper video but the previously recorded or no
     audio. The audio dub switch (if any) may be in the wrong position or the
     audio circuitry may be defective.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.3 "Snow on one or more speeds"

Did the problem happen suddenly? Or develop over time? If suddenly, what were
you watching at the time? A (literally) dirty rental movie?

If this VCR has 4 or more heads, SP and EP may use a different set of heads,
so certain heads may still be dirty or bad. If the machine tracks perfectly
in EP, then alignment is probably fine - EP is more critical as to alignment
as the EP track is 1/3 the width of the SP track.

Have the video heads been cleaned using the proper procedure (not just a
cleaning tape - see section on @{"video head cleaning" link "18.4"}

New video heads may fix this, though it can be caused by other problems such
as weak read electronics. See the section on @{"video head problems" link "18"}

You should also check the backtension adjustment - if too loose, head to tape
contact will be compromised. Try increasing it momentarily by pushing the
backtension lever slightly to the left while the tape is playing. The usual
way to adjust backtension without a backtension meter and service manual is
to look at the image just before vertical retrace at the bottom of the screen
- this is normally not visible unless you can reduce vertical size or play
with vertical hold to get the vertical blanking bar to appear. Of course,
most modern TVs don't have any such controls! This is the head switching
point and when the backtension is properly set the image above and the bit of
image below this break will be approximately aligned.

If increasing backtension helps, either the heads are marginal or the
backtension was low. However, low backtension will usually show up as a
waving or flagging effect at the top of the picture.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.4 "Jumpy picture in play"

You have a VCR with known good heads that produces jumpy (vertically) video
in play that cannot be stabilized with the tracking control. Perhaps you have
attempted to adjust the mechanical tracking and maybe some other stuff. Some
questions:

   o Did you replace the heads? Could you have gotten them 180 degree rotated
     from the correct position? I don't know what the implications would be
     on your model VCR, but there is a definite right and wrong on this. It
     would certainly show up as tracking being way out when attempting to
     play back tapes recorded on this VCR on another machine.

   o Exactly what adjustments did you touch?

   o Have you verified that the roller guides are fully engaged against the
     stops?

   o Have you checked backtension?

   o Did you touch roller guide height?

This is probably a mechanical problem, most likely an adjustment or fault
related to tape path alignment. However, it could also be due to electronic
problems with the video or servo circuitry. The vertical sync could be
corrupted or the head switching point not set correctly.

The head switching point is 6.5 lines before vertical sync. If this ends up
moving into vertical sync for some reason, you will get unstable video. The
supply side roller guide height adjustment is also critical and would be the
first thing to check mechanical alignment problems are suspected.

However, don't overlook the obvious: Your TV is marginal or misadjusted or
you are attempting to play a bad tape.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.5 "Incorrect frame alignment or bad video for part of frame"

Symptoms like a picture which has a portion that is noisy or missing, or
where the picture is split between top and bottom with the vertical blanking
somewhere in between may indicate a problem with the PG sensor.

The rotational position reference for the video head drum is usually supplied
by a pickup in close proximity to the edge of the lower cylinder (probably)
which has a small magnet fastened to it. This generates the so called 'PG'
pulse and is used by the servo circuitry to properly control the drum
rotation and the head switching point. If this sensor is moved or if there is
a fault in the PG circuitry, a variety of record or playback problems can
result. Without this reference, the servo circuitry has no way of knowing
where the A and B heads are at any given time. During record, this may result
in recording video which is not properly lined up with the video tape - a
track may consist of the end of one field and the beginning of the next
rather than an entier fields as it should. During playback, the head
switching point may occur at the wrong time resulting in a partially snowy or
missing picture since a head that is not even in contact with the tape may be
active. Similar problems may make look like your TV's vertical hold control
is set incorrectly with the vertical blanking bar visible at an arbitrary
point on the screen.

Beyond confirming that the pickup coil is in close proximity to the drum and
that there are no bad connections or loose connectors, there is not much to
be done for these problems without a service manual.

The definitions below are just FYI:

PG - pulse generator. The pulse is derived from the rotation of a magnet on
the video head drum past a sensing coil. I suppose this could be done
optically as well.

FG - frequency generator. This is a signal (sine or square) derived from the
rotation of the video head drum. This may be phase locked to the PG pulse but
can be a multiple of the frame rate. This could also refer to the capstan or
reel rotation rather than the head drum.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.6 "Rainbow pattern in recordings made over previously recorded tapes"

Unless your VCR has a flying erase head - located along with the normal video
heads on the rotating drum - you will see a faint rainbow pattern near the
start when recording over a previously used tape. The reason is that there is
a separation of a few inches in the tape path between the video heads and the
full width erase head. When you start recording at an arbitrary point, it
takes several seconds (actual time depends on recording speed) totally erased
tape to make it to the video heads. You are seeing an interference pattern
between the old and new video signals. The pattern will slowly wipe from top
to bottom as the diagonal tracks of new video intersect more and more of the
erased tape.

This effect will not occur (except possibly at the very beginning of the
tape) as long as you record from start to end without backing up the tape at
any time.

If the rainbow pattern is present whenever recording over previously recorded
tapes and does not go away, then your full width erase head is not working.
This could be due to an electronic failure or simply a bad connection to the
full width erase head. Alternatively, a mechanical problem such as a broken
or popped spring or gummed up lubrication might prevent the pivoting full
width erase head from contacting the tape properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 12.7 "Flag waving"

You have just loaded a videotape sent to you from your long lost cousin and
you notice that the top of the picture is wiggling back and forth.

First, if this wasn't the original complaint, make sure the flag waving
problem exists with the TV that will actually be used with the VCR - it may
just be your test TV or monitor that is unhappy.

(Parts of the following from: Andrew Morphitis, Andrew@andrewsm.demon.co.uk).

This fault is sometimes known as flag-waving when associated with video
recorders. If the tape back-tension provided by the tension arm and supply
reel-table is not the same as the back-tension provided when the tape was
recorded (possibly on another machine) then the field timing of the video
tracks being played back will be inconsistent . Your back- tension can be
checked using a back-tension cassette gauge (a typical reading would be about
35g-cm for VHS) or you could adjust the back tension using a known good test
tape (or reliable pre-recorded tape) until the waving disappears. If your
back-tension does turn out to be incorrect and you adjust it according to the
manufacturers spec. then all of the tapes you have previously recorded will
probably still exhibit this waving problem - adjust to spec. or to your tape
library - take your pick.

Thats the theory - now the practice. Back-tension refers to the tension of
the tape over the head drum, this is provided by the felt covered metal band
(tension band) which is wrapped around the supply reel (left-hand reel from
the front), the friction providing the tension. There are usually two
adjustments associated with back tension and these can be found near the
opposite ends of of this tension band, the tension arm operating position and
the anchor point of the band. Adjusting the latter position will increase or
decrease back tension (you will want to increase your back tension which has
dropped due to excessive wear on the belt). If you do give it a bash then be
aware that poorly adjusted back-tension can, at worst, give rise to premature
head wear. Because of the differences between the back tensions of different
machines, all modern TV's have a dedicated video channel button (usually
channel 0) which has a shorter flywheel line-timing duration allowing the TV
timebase to lock up more effectively to unstable video sources such as video
machines. Are you using the video channel? - try playing the video through
different channels on your TV.

@endnode
@node 13.1 "Poor quality sound on non-HiFi VCR"

There can be several non-electronic causes:

  1. The audio head needs to be cleaned. A cleaning tape may not be
     effective. You can use Q-tips and medicinal or pure isopropyl alcohol or
     tape head cleaning solution. You might as well clean the tape guides as
     well while you are at it - a speck of dirt can cause the tape to wander
     and produce erratic sound.

  2. The audio/control head needs to be aligned - particularly the azimith
     adjustment which is the angle the head gap makes with respect to the
     direction of the tape's long axis (I hope this is clear). You can do
     this if you are so inclined. Before you adjust azimith, a test for this
     would be to record and then play back a tape on this machine -
     regardless of how far off the azimith adjustment is, the recording
     should sound good (at least as good as one can expect from the linear
     audio) track. See the section on @{"Tape path alignment" link "19"}

  3. The audio head (and other parts) needs to be demagnetized - use an audio
     tape head demagnetizer. Stay away from the video heads. Some
     demagnetizers are powerful enough to damage them. Make sure the
     demagnetizer you use has a no sharp ends to damage anything - cover with
     electrical tape if in doubt. Turn on the demagnetizer and move it slowly
     near all metallic parts that the tape contacts - guides, levers, erase
     and audio/control head. As mentioned, do not go near the video heads.
     See the section on @{"Head demagnetizing" link "6.5"}

  4. The audio head is worn. If the poor sounds quality really bugs you,
     these can be easily replaced but they are not cheap since generic
     replacements are rarely available. Alignment will then be needed.

  5. Tape path problem causing bad tape-head contact. See section on
     @{"Tape path alignment" link "19"}

  6. Your expectations for audio quality on the linear audio tracks on a
     non-HiFi VCR are unrealistic. The worst will be a stereo VCR in EP mode
     since the stereo tracks are less than half as wide as non-stereo tracks.
     Best will be SP non-stereo but even this is very poor for music. Once
     you get used to HiFi quality, linear audio sounds like crud.

@endnode
@node 13.2 "Excessive flutter on VHS linear audio playback"

While general quality of VHS linear audio is almost always mediocre, there
should not be excessive flutter - wavering in pitch. Certainly it should not
be noticeable for speech. How bad music sounds will depend on your
expectations as well. Here are some possible causes:

   o Dirty/gummed up stationary guides or A/C head.
   o Lack of lubrication of the capstan or roller guides.
   o Excessively tight idler or other clutch.
   o Bad capstan motor, especially if direct drive type, or motor driver.
   o Servo system problems.
   o Power supply problems.
   o Stiction between tape and lower cylinder.
   o Unrealistic expectations of linear audio quality. Some VCRs are
     downright terrible, especially at EP speed. This is normal.

@endnode
@node 13.3 "Previous (non-HiFi) audio is not erased on new recordings"

If the old audio track is unchanged - you get the new video but old audio,
check that any dubbing switches are set correctly - to enable audio.

If you are getting a mixture of old and new audio, then there could be a
problem with the audio erase head (part of the A/C head stack) or its
circuitry.

Clean the audio/control head (the stationary head to the right of the video
drum near where the tape re-enters the cassette. Check for dirt or tape oxide
on or around the audio/control head.

Beyond this, testing will probably require a schematic. However, if you can
locate the connections to the audio erase head, use an ohmmeter to test for
continuity of the coil. Check with an oscilloscope for the high frequency
erase signal during record.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 13.4 "Poor quality sound on HiFi VCR"

The VCR may be switching between HiFi and linear audio at random (with the
HiFi light also flickering on and off or simply not selecting HiFi audio at
all.

The sound out of a HiFi (not just stereo) VCR should be virtually
indistinguishable from the original and for good quality source material,
nearly as good as a CD.

What to look for if it is really playing HiFi (try at slowest tape speed as
this will have little effect on HiFi quality but will turn the linear track
quality to crud). Use a tape with a musical recording for this:

   o Almost no tape hiss (background should be virtually silent).
   o Excellent frequency response (treble notes should sound natural).
   o Excellent dynamic range (loud louds and soft softs).
   o No detectable wow or flutter (no short or long term wavering in pitch).

Since the HiFi heads are on the rotating video head cylinder, they are
subject to the same problems as video heads - and the same difficulties in
diagnosing head problems. Dirt, damage, or electronic defects can cause the
HiFi sound to be absent or distorted. A broken or badly worn HiFi head will
simply cause the VCR to switch to the linear audio tracks. HiFi head
alignment is more critical than video head alignment so this may need to be
checked. Try adjusting the manual video tracking control as this will also
affect HiFi audio tracking and see if this clear up the sound.

@node 13.5 "Squealing noise from VCR in certain modes"

Unusual noises from inside the VCR may be an indication of a problem or just
a badly made cassette - try a different one.

The most common cause for a squealing noise are tired weak belts that are
slipping. Less likely is the need for lubrication.

   o A squeal when entering play or record mode - with the VCR perhaps
     aborting the operation - is usually caused by a slipping loading belt.

   o A squeal during fast FF or REW may indicate a slipping drive belt.

   o A squeal or whine during play or record (perhaps intermittently when the
     video head drum is spinning) could be a worn video head drum bearing or
     dirty or improperly positioned static brush (see also: "High pitched
     whine from inside VCR").

See the appropriate sections on @{"cleaning, rubber parts" link "6.3"} and @{"lubrication" link "6.4"}

   o A whine from the audio (of the TV) while using the VCR may indicate bad

@endnode
@node 13.6 "High pitched whine from inside VCR"

Your first thought is probably of an expensive repair to a motor bearing or
replacement lower cylinder. If there is a high pitched whine coming from
inside the VCR when in PLAY, REC, or other mode which spins the video heads,
you may simply have a dirty or mispositioned antistatic brush.

There is usually a metal strip with a carbon contact pressing against the
center of the video drum spindle either above or below the deck. It is very
common for it to vibrate is just the right way to sound like a cat being
strangled. Gently press on this strip or lift it off of the spindle while you
hear the sound. If the whine disappears, cleaning and slight repositioning of
the strip should be all you need to do. Do not remove this strip - it is
needed to ground the rotating drum to prevent static buildup and video noise
problems (see the section on: @{"Firing (static) lines in picture during playback" link "14.5"}

@endnode
@node 14.1 "VCR color problems"

There are two typical situations:

   o Playback is always in B/W.
   o Record is B/W but playback has normal color.

If you can play prerecorded tapes in color but tapes recorded on this VCR do
not play back in color, there may be several possible causes. The simplest is
that your input signal is too weak - a misadjusted antenna or cable with a
large number of splitters - and the VCR's color killer thinks there is no
color. Sometimes the threshold for detecting the color signal is set higher
on the VCR than the TV which you are using to monitor the recording.

Some questions:

   o Is the color TV's fine tuning set correctly?
   o Does it play prerecorded tapes in color?
   o Does the tuner output produce color?
   o Does the video output work in color?
   o Is the problem the same for all recording speeds?
   o Do the tapes you record on this VCR play in color on another one?

If the answer to all but the last question is 'yes', then the problem is most
likely in the video/chroma circuitry associated with recording function. It
could be as simple as the color killer setting being too low.

Possible sources of problems with color recording:

  1. Weak signal - check and/or adjust antenna.
  2. Color Killer set to low.
  3. Problems in tuner - does the video output work in color from the tuner?
  4. Problems in chroma circuits.
  5. Sometimes, marginal heads - less likely if it plays in color.

If recording works fine as indicated by tapes made on this VCR playing fine
on another one but prerecorded tapes do not play back in color and the VCR
works fine in all other respects there could be several possible causes:

  1. Weak chroma signal level from VCR.
  2. Color Killer set to low on TV.
  3. Problems in chroma circuits.
  4. Marginal or dirty video heads.

Note that in all cases of missing color, checking with another TV and/or
adjusting the TV's controls should be tried first as slight differences in
signal levels between tuner and playback may cause a TV with marginal
settings (fine tuning, color killer, chroma circuits) to switch unexpectedly
between color and B/W.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 14.2 "RF signal problems"

First determine whether there is a problem with broadcast or cable, playing
tapes, or both. If it is only broadcast or cable, then your source may be at
fault. If it is fine with the VCR off but noisy when using its tuner, the
problem could be in the tuner itself.

Verify that the direct video output (RCA jacks) works properly with a
prerecorded tape. If this is noisy as well, then there are problems with the
video circuitry or video heads.

If there are problems with the Channel 3/4 output but the direct video
outputs are fine, then suspect a weak or dead RF modulator. This is a little
metal metal box with the Antenna In and TV Out connectors. It has circuitry
which switches between the VCR's internal video signal and the antenna input.
It also converts the video baseband signal to the channel 3/4 output required
by the TV.

Before you conclude that the RF modulator is to blame, check that the channel
and fine tuning of the TV are properly set and that there are no other
problems with the TV. Test the VCR with another TV. It could be that the
signal from the VCR is just a little weaker than it is used to be. Try moving
the channel 3/4 switch back an forth - it may have developed a bad contact.
Try the other channel (3 or 4) - it may work better. Try moving the VCR away
from the TV - sometimes interference from the TV will degrade the video
quality.

If you do conclude that the RF modulator is at fault, generic replacements
are available from the parts sources listed near the end of this document or
other electronics distributors for less than $25. Replacement is
straightforward since there are only a couple of soldered connections but
getting to the unit physically is sometimes a challenge.

@endnode
@node 14.3 "VCR will not tune broadcast or cable"

Are you sure that the input signal is making to the VCR? Does the pass-
through connection work? Double check the connections. Connect the cable you
have on the ANTENNA IN of the VCR directly to the TV. Make sure it's center
pin is not bent over or broken off. Try a new cable. Is the tuning mode
switch (broadcast, CATV, etc.) set correctly on the VCR?

If the signal is preset into the VCR, there still may be a bad connection
inside preventing it from making it to the VCR's tuner. Sometimes, there are
RCA style plugs inside that work loose.

Otherwise, the tuner of the VCR is not working. This could be because it is
broken or power to it is bad or missing. If all other functions of the VCR
are working, it is likely (though not guaranteed) that the power supply is
fine. There could be bad connections or dirty connectors as well.

Beyond probing for bad connections and verifying your antenna hookup, there
is not much that can be done without a service manual and test equipment.

   o Have you rearranged your setup recently? It is common for TVs and VCRs

as large quantities of firing lines may be due to dirty, worn, or defective
video heads.

First, try a different tape - preferably a new recording made on a different
VCR or a new commercial video. It is possible that these streaks are simply
due to dropouts on the tape - missing bits of oxide or dirt causing momentary
loss of video signal. Old, worn, or cheap off-brand tapes are particularly
prone to dropouts.

One characteristic of dropouts is that they may span video lines as well as
video frames. If your lines are very short and random, they may be caused by
a dirty, missing, or improperly positioned video drum static brush. In most
VCRs, you will see a metal strip with a carbon contact pressing against the
center of the video drum spindle either above or below the deck. It is there
to provide electrical contact between the rotating video drum and the
stationary lower cylinder and chassis. This is necessary since the bearings
on which the upper cylinder rotate may not provide adequate contact and any
static buildup caused by the spinning head cylinder rubbing against the tape
may discharge through the bearings resulting in these firing lines. Carefully
remove the static brush and clean the end of the spindle and carbon contact.
This may be all you need to do to remove the static lines from your picture.

@node 15.1 "Multiple system problems"

Most VCR problems will be limited to a specific subsystem - video, audio,
tuner, servo, control. When multiple seemingly unrelated problems occur at
the same time, suspect a power supply problem since multiple systems may be
fed from common power supply outputs.

There are always several different voltages used within a VCR - if one of
these dies, some subsystems will work but will not receive the proper signals
from the dead parts. So, nearly any kind of behavior is possible.

Therefore, the first test is to determine, if possible, that the power supply
outputs voltages are correct - both with power off and power on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 15.2 "Power supply problems - unit totally dead/major system problems in all modes"

Power supply problems can range from intermittent behavior due to slightly
out of tolerance voltages, hum, or noise to a totally dead VCR. Multiple
system failures can result if one or more of the half dozen or so voltages
used within the VCR are incorrect or missing.

Some power supply problems are caused by power surges. These may result in a
totally dead VCR or in overstress and subsequent failure of various
components. A power strip with a circuit breaker, even with surge protector
is not a reliable protection against power surges especially during
lightening storms. The only sure protection is unplugging electronic
equipment during storms - but then, what would your insurance agent have to
do?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 15.3 "VCR power supplies"

Reread Safety info before tackling any power supply problem in a VCR!

VCRs typically use one of four types of power supplies (There are no doubt
others):

  1. Power transformer with linear regulator using 78/79XX parts or discrete
     components. The power transformer will be large and very near the AC
     line cord.

  2. Power transformer with hybrid regulator like STK5481 or any of its
     cousins - multioutput with some outputs switched by power on. If it has
     one of these, check ECG, SK, or NTE, or post to sci.electronics.repair
     and someone can probably provide the pinout. Again, the power
     transformer will be large and very near the AC line cord.

  3. Small switching power supply. Most common problems: shorted
     semiconductors, bad capacitors, open fusable resistors. In this case
     there is usually no large power transformer near the line input but a
     smaller transformer amidships.

  4. Combo of the previous - these are less common. An input power
     transformer may supply low voltage to a switcher.

  5. Camcorders and portable video camera-VCR combos include a battery
     charger and run all normal VCR (and camera) functions off of the
     battery. The required voltages are derived using DC-DC invertors.

Here are some general comments for each type:

  1. Troubleshooting is quite straightforward as the components are readily
     identified and it is easy to trace through from the power transformer,
     bridge or centertapped full wave rectifiers, regulators, caps, etc. The
     circuitry is not usually complex and the most common failures tend to be
     quite obvious.

  2. Failures of one or more of the outputs of these hybrid regulator blocks
     are very common. Use ECG/STK/NTE cross reference to identify the correct
     output voltages. Test with power switch in both positions. Any
     significant discrepancy indicates a likely problem. While an excessive
     load dragging down a voltage is possible, the regulator is the first
     suspect. Replacement cost is usually under $10.

  3. Switching supply problems are tougher to diagnose but it is usually
     possible without service literature by tracing the circuit and checking
     for bad semiconductors with an ohmmeter. Common problems - dried up
     capacitors, shorted semiconductors, and bad solder joints. In a supply
     that is dead - has blown the main fuse - check ALL semiconductors,
     capacitors, and resistors as a failure in one may damage others and just
     replacing the first one you find that is bad may result in it just
     blowing immediately. Fusable (flameproof) resistors (blue or brown body
     or boxy ceramic power type) may open up if there was a shorted switching
     transistor. Power resistors supplying current for the startup circuit
     may open from age. See 'Notes on Diagnosis and Repair of Small
     Switchmode Power Supplies' for more detailed information.

  4. Problems in either the power transformer/rectifier/filter capacitor
     section (usually no regulator) or switching supply are possible.
     However, they can pretty much be dealt with independently. Note: the
     switching supplies used in these usually run off of a lower voltage
     input than the more common off-line non-isolated type making them
     somewhat less hazardous to your health to work on.

  5. Problems can occur in either the battery charger or power supply
     section. Short running time on battery alone is usually caused by a bad
     battery. If possible, try a known good battery or battery eliminator
     first to determine which it is. The older style portable units were
     quite reliable and easy to service. However, modern camcorders are so
     jam packed with microminiature surface mount unmarked circuitry that
     troubleshooting and repair is definitely not fun. Not to mention the
     joys of just getting inside with only a finite use of expletives.

Don't overlook the possibility of bad solder connections as well.

@node 15.4 "Internal fuse blew during lightening storm (or elephant hit power pole)"

Power surges or nearby lightening strikes can destroy electronic equipment.
However, most of the time, damage is minimal or at least easily repaired.
With a direct hit, you may not recognize what is left of it!

Ideally, electronic equipment should be unplugged (both AC line and phone
line!) during electrical storms if possible. Modern TVs, VCRs, microwave
ovens, and even stereo equipment is particularly susceptible to lightening
and surge damage because some parts of the circuitry are always alive and
therefore have a connection to the AC line. Telephones, modems, and faxes are
directly connected to the phone lines. Better designs include filtering and
surge suppression components built in. With a near-miss, the only thing that
may happen is for the internal fuse to blow or for the microcontroller to go
bonkers and just require power cycling. There is no possible protection
against a direct strike.

Most VCRs have their own internal surge protection devices like MOVs (Metal
Oxide Varistors) after the fuse. So it is possible that all that is wrong is
that the line fuse has blown. Remove the case (Unplug it first!) and start at
the line cord. If you find a blown fuse, remove it and measure across the
in-board side of fuse holder and the other (should be the neutral) side of
the line. With the power switch off, this reading should be very high. With
the switch on, it may be quite low if the VCR uses a large power transformer
- a typical primary resistance is 15 to 30 ohms.

Some VCRs may be outside this range but if the reading is extremely low, the
power transformer could have a partially or totally shorted primary. If it is
very high (greater than 1 K ohms), then the primary of the power transformer
may be open or there may be blown thermal fuse under the insulation wrappings
of the transformer windings.

If the VCR has a switching power supply, see the document: "Notes on the
Diagnosis and Repair of small SwitchMode Power Supplies (SMPS)".

If the resistance checks out, replace the fuse and try powering the unit.
There will be 3 possibilities:

  1. It will work fine, problem solved.

  2. It will immediately blow the fuse. This means there is at least one
     component shorted - possibilities include an MOV, line filter capacitor,
     transformer primary.

  3. It will not work properly or still appear dead. This could mean there
     are blown fuses or fusable resistors or other defective parts in the
     power supply or other circuitry. In this case further testing will be
     needed and at some point you may require the schematic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 15.5 "Use of surge suppressors and line filters"

Should you always use a surge suppressor outlet strip or line circuit? Sure,
it shouldn't hurt. Just don't depend on these to provide protection under all
circumstances. Some are better than others and the marketing blurb is at best
of little help in making an informed selection. Product literature - unless
it is backed up by testing from a reputable lab - is usually pretty useless
and often confusing.

Line filters can also be useful if power in you area is noisy or prone to
spikes or dips.

However, keep in mind that most well designed electronic equipment already
includes both surge suppressors like MOVs as well as L-C line filters. More
is not necessarily better but may move the point of failure to a readily
accessible outlet strip rather than the innards of your equipment if damage
occurs.

It is still best to unplug everything if the air raid sirens go off or you
see an elephant wearing thick glasses running through the neighborhood (or an
impending lightening storm). Generally, the backup battery or supercap will
retain the clock and programming information long enough to ride out a
typical storm.

@node 16.1 "VCR poops out after a couple of hours"

What could be the cause of the video dying on a VCR after it is playing for a
couple of hour? Here are some questions:

   o Do all modes 'go out' or just PLAY?

   o Does it happen suddenly or just gradually worsens until it is total
     snow? Or, do you get the 'blue screen' if it has this function rather
     than snow?

   o Does the tuner still work?

   o Conversely, does PLAY work but not the tuner?

   o Do other functions like FF and REW always work?

   o How is the time it sits turned off related to how much on time you get?

   o Have you verified that the TV is fine?

   o Is it possible that the VCR is covered up/closed in/installed with
     inadequate ventilation?

It could be a loose connection or bad component. The usual way to narrow down
the possibilities is to use what is called 'cold spray' or 'circuit chiller'
on the appropriate sections of the circuit board until you locate the
component that is failing with when it gets hot. I once had a VCR that needed
a little fan blowing on it to keep it happy - much easier solution than
actually hunting down the fault.

If play or record just stopped and the tape unloaded, it could also be a
mechanical problem like a marginal idler tire, idler clutch, or worn belt.

@endnode
@node 16.2 "VCR was dropped"

So your cat decided it was time to practice the long-jump and didn't quite
pick a stable destination. Your VCR is on the floor, Tabby is in the
basement, and what to do?

Overall, VCRs are quite tough. However, falling in just the wrong way can do
substantial and possibly not immediately visible damage.

If you take it in for service, the estimate you get may make the national
debt look like pocket change in comparison. Attempting to repair a VCR that
has been dropped is a very uncertain challenge - and since time is money for
a professional, spending an unknown amount of time on a single repair is very
risky. There is no harm is getting an estimate (though many shops charge for
just agreeing that what you are holding is a VCR!)

This doesn't mean you should not tackle it yourself. There may be nothing
wrong or very minor problems that can easily be remedied.

First, unplug the VCR even if it looks fine. Until you do a thorough internal
inspection, there is no telling what may have been knocked out of whack or
broken. Electrical parts may be shorting due to a broken circuit board or one
that has just popped free. Don't be tempted to power the VCR even if there
are no obvious signs of damage - turning it on may blow something due to a
shorting circuit board.

Then, inspect the exterior for cracking, chipping, or dents. In addition to
identifying cosmetic problems, this will help to locate possible areas to
check for internal damage once the covers are removed.

Next, remove the top and bottom covers and front panel. Check for mechanical
problems like a bent or deformed cassette basket, broken or cracked plastic
parts, and anything that may have shifted position or jumped from its
mountings.

Carefully straighten any bent metal parts. Replace parts that were knocked
loose, glue and possibly reinforce cracked or broken plastic. Plastics, in
particular, are troublesome because most glues - even plastic cement - do not
work very well. Using a splint (medical term) or sistering (construction
term) to reinforce a broken plastic part is often a good idea. Use multiple
layers of Duco Cement or clear windshield sealer and screws (sheetmetal or
machine screws may be best depending on the thickness and type of plastic).
Wood glue and Epoxy do not work well on plastic. Some brands of superglue,
PVC pipe cement, or plastic hobby cement may work depending on the type of
plastic.

Cycle the cassette loading and tape loading mechanism manually by turning the
appropriate motor shaft, if possible. Check for free movement of the various
parts of the tape transport.

Inspect for any broken electronic components - these will need to be
replaced. If the fluorescent panel is broken, you can run the VCR without it
but of course will not be able to see any front panel displays. Check for
blown fuses - the initial impact may have shorted something which then blew a
fuse.

There is always a slight risk that the initial impact has already fried
electronic parts as a result of a momentary short or from broken circuit
traces and there will still be problems even after repairing the visible
damage and/or replacing the broken components.

Examine the circuit boards for any visible breaks or cracks. These will be
especially likely at the corners where the stress may have been greatest. If
you find ANY cracks, no matter how small in the circuit board, you will need
to carefully inspect to determine if any circuit traces run across these
cracks. If they do, then there are certainly breaks in the circuitry which
will need to be repaired. Circuit boards in VCRs are never more than two
layers so repair is possible but if any substantial number of traces are
broken, it will take a great deal of painstaking work to jumper across these
traces with fine wire - you cannot just run over them with solder as this
will not last. Use a fine tipped low wattage soldering iron under a
magnifying lens and run #28-30 gauge insulated wires between convenient
endpoints - these don't need to be directly on either side of the break.
Double check each connection after soldering for correct wiring and that
there are no shorts before proceeding to the next.

If the circuit board is beyond hope or you do not feel you would be able to
repair it in finite time, replacements may be available but their cost is
likely to be more than the VCR is worth. Locating a junk VCR of the same
model to cannibalize for parts may be a more realistic option.

Once all visible damage has been repaired and broken parts have been
replaced, power the VCR up and see what happens. Be prepared to pull the plug
if there are serious problems (billowing smoke would qualify). Determine if
it appears to initialize correctly - without shutting down. Play a garbage
tape to determine if there are any problems that might damage the tape. Watch
and listen carefully for any evidence of poor tracking, video noise, tape
speed instability, or weak or muddy audio that might indicate that tape path
alignment requires further attention. Listen as well for any unexpected
mechanical sounds that were not there before.

Very likely, the VCR will be fine, you can replace the covers, and now find a
more secure spot for it to prevent this sort of event in the future. Use your
own judgement with respect to the cat.

@endnode
@node 16.3 "VCR or camcorder went to the beach (sand and/or surf)"

Someone took your camcorder to the beach this summer and now it has sand or
perhaps salt inside. Or, that cup of tea on top of the VCR wasn't as stable
as you thought. Now, it behaves, well, strangely. Can this possibly be fixed?
Will it be worth the effort or expense?

Unless this is a really sophisticated (i.e., costly) unit, I doubt whether it
will pay you to take it anywhere for repair. Even if it is successfully
repaired, its reliability may be questionable. Furthermore, as with equipment
that has been dropped or physically abused, few repair shops will be inclined
to touch the job. They really don't like challenges of this sort.

That leaves you!

If anything got wet with saltwater and it has been just sitting, you can
probably forget it. Without immediate attention (and I mean immediate, not
later, not tomorrow, NOW!), saltwater corrosion can set in very quickly and
attacks electronic components, circuit board traces, cable wiring, and
mechanical parts. The only thing worse might be a peanut-butter-and-jelly
sandwich 'played' in your VCR. On second thought, that probably would not be
all that bad.

Although it is probably too late, the first thing to do when electronic
equipment gets wet is to remove the power source - pull the plug or remove
the batteries. Don't be tempted to apply power until you have determined that
everything is completely dried out inside and out.

DO NOT use strong solvents anywhere! These may attack various plastic parts
or cause internal damage to electronic components.

The following was written assuming sand, salt, and liquid contamination
everywhere! Modify based on your specific situation.

Mechanical intensive care:

  1. Disassemble as much as possible - sand and surf (or other liquids) find
     their way into the tiniest nooks and crannies. You need to get it all.

  2. Make a drawing of the belt routing, remove the belt(s), wash and dry
     them, label and set them aside.

  3. Use a soft brush (like a paintbrush) to dust out as much sand as
     possible. Hopefully, you can get it all this way. A vacuum cleaner with
     a wand attachment may prove handy to suck out sand. Sand will tend to
     collect on lubrication, especially grease, which will need to be
     completely cleaned out and replaced. Don't use high pressure compressed
     air, you will just spread it around. Any grease or oil on which sand has
     collected will need to be totally removed and replace with fresh
     lubrication.

  4. If there is evidence of salt (remember, I said forget it...but), you
     will need to wash it off. Yes, wash it. Keep water out of the motors.
     Use low pressure compressed air (a blow dryer on low heat should be
     fine) to dry so that it does not rust. Ditto if it is still wet with
     contaminated liquid (we won't say where this came from), wash with fresh
     water to remove all traces of it as quickly as possible. Then dry
     completely. Depending on the situation, a final rinse with 91% or pure
     isopropyl alcohol may be desirable to decrease drying time. This should
     be safe for most mechanical assemblies. Degreaser may be used if it is
     safe for plastic and rubber parts.

     Lubricate all bearing points with a drop of light machine oil - electric
     motor oil, sewing machine oil, etc. (Never never never WD40). Lubricate
     gears, cams, and sliding parts with a light plastic safe grease such as
     Molylube.

     Parts like the idler clutch may need to be disassembled to get at the
     friction felt. Other mechanical parts like cam gears may need to be
     removed to be properly cleaned. Don't mess up the timing relationships
     when you do this!

  5. Reinstall the belts and reassemble in reverse order.

Electronic intensive care:

  1. Remove the circuit boards and label the connectors if there is any
     possibility of getting them mixed up. If the circuit board(s) are
     soldered to the rest of the equipment, then you will have to improvise
     and work in-place.

  2. Wash with water and dry thoroughly. This does work. I use it routinely
     for degunking remote controls and rubber membrane keypads, for example.
     I have heard of people cleaning contaminated computer keyboards in their
     dishwasher! The important objective should be to get corrosive liquids
     off the components and circuit traces as quickly and completely as
     possible. A final rinse with 91% or pure isopropyl alcohol will decrease
     drying time. However, there is a slight risk of damage to sensitive
     electronic components should some be trapped inside. Pat dry, then use
     warm air from a hair dryer (or heat gun on low) to completely dry
     everything. Moisture will be trapped in controls, coils, selector
     switches, relays, transformer cores, connectors, and under large
     components like ICs. DO NOT operate until everything inside and out is
     thoroughly dry.

  3. Use spray contact cleaner on the switches and control cleaner on the
     control and adjustment pots. DON'T turn the internal adjustments without
     precisely marking the original position - else realignment will then be
     needed. However, exercise the user controls to help the cleaning
     process.

Note: drying time may be quite long. For parts with inaccessible areas like
membrane keypads, you may need to wait a week before normal operation is
restored. Be patient!

Once everything is completely dry as a bone and reassembled, power it up but
be prepared to pull the plug or pop the batteries if there are serious
problems. See if the display comes alive and the transport appears to
initialize. Attempt to play a garbage tape to determine if there are any
mechanical problems that might damage the tape. Look and listen for any
abnormalities which may require additional attention. Then address specific
problem areas. Also see the section: @{"VCR was dropped" link "16.2"} for additional info.

Obviously, this description is very simplistic. The important thing is to get
every last grain of sand, salt, and other contaminants off of the mechanisms
and circuit boards quickly.

As noted above, moisture may collect inside certain electronic parts and it
is essential that these be dried completely before attempting to apply power
to the unit. If you do not, at best it will not work properly and you may do
additional serious damage due to short circuits.

For the mechanics, the same applies though this is trickier since certain
parts need to be lubricated and these may not be readily accessible or
obvious. Don't be tempted to overdo the lubrication - too much is worse than
too little.

For camcorders, some parts of the optics or enclosed DC-DC convertors may be
impossible to access and clean of scum.

@node 16.4 "Dead remote control units"

If there is no response to any functions by the TV or VCR, verify that any
mode switches are set correctly (on both the remote and the TV or VCR). Check
and replace the batteries if necessary. Unplug the TV or VCR for 30 seconds
(not just power off, unplug). This sometimes resets a microcontroller that
may have been confused by a power surge. If it is a universal remote, it may
have forgotten its programming - reinitialize with the codes for your
equipment.

Test the remote with an IR detector. An IR detector card can be purchased for
about $6. Alternatively, build the circuit at the end of this document. If
the remote is putting out an IR signal, then the remote or the TV or VCR may
have forgotten its settings or the problem may be in the TV or VCR and not
the hand unit.

For more info, see the companion document on "Notes on the Repair of Hand
Held Remote Controls".

There are a large variety of universal remotes available from $10-$100. For
general TV/VCR/cable use, the $10 are fine. However, they will not provide
the special functions like programming of a TV or VCR. Don't even think about
going to the original manufacturer - they will charge an arm and a leg (or
more).

@node 16.5 "Recovering damaged or broken tapes"

So you just pulled your favorite tape from the VCR and there are two tape
ends dangling from it. Or, perhaps, your VCR has just munched on that tape
and a section is now seriously crickled. Maybe you haven't been following the
recommendations on preventive maintenance; maybe your VCR was just hungry. In
any case, what to do? The recording is, of course, irreplaceable.

Despite this, I recommend you chuck it. An imperfect splice or seriously
crinkled section of tape can shatter your video heads - the most expensive
single part in a VCR. If it is something you really treasure, than what I
would do is the following:

  1. Locate a garbage cassette and disassemble it. Throw away the tape but
     save everything else including the reels.

  2. Construct two cassettes from the combined collection of parts you now
     have. Cut out any sections of tape that got mangled.

     Cassette 1 has the first section of tape (before the break) and uses one
     empty reel from the garbage cassette for the supply reel. Rewind this to
     the beginning.

     Cassette 2 has the second section of tape (after the break) and uses the
     other empty reel from the garbage cassette for the takeup reel.

     Use the little plastic plugs that came from the garbage tape reels or
     some adhesive tape to connect the tape to the reels.

  3. If the break is at one end, you can just reconnect the bulk of the tape
     to the reel and dispose of the original leader. Just don't rewind or
     fast forward all the way to the end as the automatic end sensor will not
     work (for the particular end that has been repaired).

  4. Copy to a good cassette.

  5. Dispose of the original(s) or clearly mark 'DO NOT USE' with a detailed
     explanation.

The idea is to never have a splice in a VHS cassette. (Even a seriously
crinkled tape such as might result from a tape eating incident can damage the
heads.) It is possible to splice safely but as noted, it can be quite costly
if you don't get it quite right.

@node 16.6 "Cassette rewinder problems"

Cassette rewinders typically consist of a low voltage motor powered from a
built in transformer or wall adapter, a belt, a couple of reels, and some
means of stopping the motor and popping the lid when the tape is fully
rewound.

Note that some designs are very hard on cassettes - yanking at the tape since
only increased tension is used to detect when the tape is at the end. These
may eventually stretch the tape or rip it from the reel. As noted, I don't
really care much for the use of tape rewinders as normal use of rewind and
fast forward is not a major cause of VCR problems. Sluggish or aborted REW
and FF may simply indicate an impending failure of the idler tire or idler
clutch which should be addressed before the VCR gets really hungry and eats
your most valuable and irreplaceable tape.

Problems with tape rewinders are usually related to a broken or stretched
belt or other broken parts. These units are built about as cheaply as
possible so failures should not be at all surprising. The drive motor can
suffer from any of the afflictions of similar inexpensive permanent magnet
motors found in consumer electronic equipment. See the section: @{"Motors in VCRs" link "21.1"}
A broken belt is very common since increased belt (and tape) tension
is used to switch the unit off (hopefully). Parts can pop off of their
mountings. Flimsy plastic parts can break.

Opening the case is usually the biggest challenge - screws or snaps may be
used. Test the motor and its power supply, inspect for broken or dislocated
parts, test the power switch, check and replace the belt if needed. That is
about it.

@node 17.1 "Dead Clock in Hitachi manufactured VCR"

The clock display is dark but other functions are normal.

(From the besancon@rain.org (Fred Besancon))

Your vcr probably was made by Hitachi (Sears is one brand that may be
manufactured by Hitachi). If so, probably your DC to DC converter went bad.
Please note the the converter is close to the front of the vcr and not in
your main power supply board. A complete kit is sold by most vendors. That
is, you have to replace capacitors, transformer, etc. as well as probably an
I.C.

(From the Editor)

Parts Express has several kits for the Hitach ($12-13) that include other
parts that may have died as well. They also have the RCA part for ~$13.
Another brand affected is older RCA models.

Louis A. Iannotta adds; "The DC to DC converter you are replacing should be
replaced together with the 3 electrolytic capacitors which could have caused
it to fail along with the ICP-N10 circuit protect. RCA makes a kit with all
the parts you will need to replace. The part number is 163818 and is

@node 17.2 "JVC tracking problems and dropped parts"

You have a JVC VCR, 1990 or so vintage and it upped and died on you.

JVC, huh? How did it die? What are the symptoms? Major tracking problems?
Eats tapes? JVCs of that era tend to shed parts in the tape loading mechanism
- easily fixed. Unless it is a serious electronic problem, a service manual
may not help. And even then, it may not have the information you need.

Check the roller guide assemblies (see the section on @{"tape path alignment" link "19"}

If one of them flops around (they will be loose except in the fully loaded
position but should not come off the track), then it has lost the brass
guidepost underneath. Remove the bottom cover and you should see it drop out.
Without the guide, the roller guide will not seat properly and tracking will
be way off. Use a dab of Epoxy or superglue to replace the brass post fully
against the shoulder in the cast roller guide base. If this is done
carefully, tape path realignment should not be needed.

Alternatively, replacement roller guide assemblies are available.

Warning: do not attempt to load a tape if a roller guide assembly can be
lifted off of the track - it may smash the rotating video heads - very
expensive lesson.

If a roller guide does not seat fully against the V-stopper (the end piece),
then a linkage pin may have loosened. This is plastic pin which is the hinge
for the linkage which moves the roller guide assembly. I have used a tiny
screw from the top to firmly reattach this pin. Alternatively, a dab of
plastic cement may work. Tape path realignment should not be needed.

@node 17.3 "Panasonic and clones switching power supplies"

A number of Panasonic and other Matsushita brand clones use a switching power
supply which has a couple of common failure modes.

   o Blown fuse and shorted switchmode transistor and possible other failed
     parts. Replacement of the obvious shorted or open parts usually cures
     these. Test all semiconductors and fusable resistors - do not assume
     that a single part is bad. If you just replace the first bad part you
     find, it may just be blown again by other bad parts.

   o Low output voltages. If the 5 V (approximately) outputs measure low, 3.5
     V, for example, then there is a leaky capacitor in the power supply
     startup limiter. A common part number is C21 - 1 uF, 50 V.

   o The primary side filter and other electrolytics may lose capacity
     resulting in hum or ripple and regulation problems. Replacing all
     electrolytic capacitors in the power supply is probably the best
     solution.

Check out the schematic for a typical Panasonic switchmode power supply
available at this site.

@node 17.4 "Late model Sony VCR munches tape on eject"

Symptoms are that upon eject, a loop of tape may be hanging out and possibly
held by an arm inside the deck. The cause is gummed up lubrication on the
pivot of that 'half loading arm' on the right side of the transport. It is
supposed to help pull the tape out of the cassette during loading and then
spring back when unloading. If the lubrication gets sticky, it does not
spring back and grabs onto the tape during eject.

Someone gave me a fancy Sony HiFi VCR with the request "I will pay up to $150
to fix it. Circuit City said that it could not be repaired for less than $250
because my kids had gotten into it and recommended replacement" (I wonder
why). It was the stupid loading arm. Obviously, the grade-A techs at Circuit
City were either under orders not to suggest repairs if they could get away
with it and/or had never even taken the top off of the thing because the
owner had mumbled something about his kids.

I could have made a bundle off of that. I could have had a nice VCR for
nothing. I just gave it back and told him about the drop of oil.

(Portions of the following from: blatter@amiga.icu.net.ch ((Martin A.

Belts and idler tires are always the first thing to check for this sort of
problem but older Symphonic/Funai VCRs (Those without the 'quickstart' type
mechanism) also have a small rubber bumper/stop for the brake levers, etc. on
top of the deck by the tape reels. It wears out and then the lever catches
don't engage properly. The old mechanism was replaced by a compact direct
drive type which is mounted directly on the PCB in 1993 (at least on the
European PAL models).

Part #8059-02-23 is available at electronics distributors such as Fox
International in Ohio or MAT Electronics in PA. Symphonic/Funai Corp, 100
North St, Teterboro, NJ 07608 phone 201 288-2606. Alternatively, just wedge a
bit of plastic inside the rubber bumper to fatten it a bit or just turn it
around to expose the unworn side. This works just as well as a replacement
part.

@node 18.1 "What is a Video head?"

The flying video heads in a VCR or camcorder are the actual transducers which
scan the tape during REC and PLAY. The head drum or upper cylinder, as it is
often called, spins at 1800 RPM (for NTSC, actually 29.97 Hz) with one
complete rotation representing a video frame (525 lines in the US consisting
of 2 fields which are interlaced). The result of the spinning head is to
provide an effective head-tape speed of over 24 feet/second needed to achieve
the required video bandwidth.

The actual video heads are the nearly microscopic transducers that contact
the tape and magnetically record or playback the video information. The upper
cylinder is the entire rotating assembly including the video heads. The heads
are aligned and locked in place on the upper cylinder at the time of
manufacture and this alignment should never be touched.

(Note that the terms 'video heads' and 'upper cylinder' are often used
interchangeably but strictly speaking this is not correct.)

The heads themselves are made from ferrite which is an extremely hard ceramic
magnetic material which is also very fragile. The head chips can be seen at
the very bottom of the rotating upper cylinder. The actual construction is of
a 'C' shape with a very small gap between the arms of the 'C' - about 1 um or
so. This is filled with with a non-magnetic material to force the magnetic
field out of the head into the tape and to prevent material from collecting
in the gap. A few turns of fine wire form the coil of an electromagnet for
recording and as a pickup coil for playback. If you look at a head chip from
below (on a cylinder that has been removed) you can see the coil and the
shape of the core, though you will not be able to tell if a head is bad or
worn by this inspection unless there is obvious damage). A powerful
microscope is needed to even see the gap.

VCRs are described as having '2 heads' or '4 heads' or whatever. This
actually refers to the number of head gaps and not actual head chips though
usually this is the same number. However, two head chips may be placed very
close together and thus appear to be a single head when in fact there are a
pair of head gaps. Therefore, without a close examination, there may only
appear to be 2 heads when in fact there are 4 - in 2 pairs. You are not being
short changed.

Two heads are required for any play, record, or search function. Usually,
these are exactly 180 degrees apart - directly opposing one another on the
upper cylinder. With 4 head (or 3 head or 5 head) VCRs, various combinations
of heads are used for each mode to optimize record or playback video quality
by selecting a pair of heads with optimal widths and other characteristics.
These may end up not being exactly 180 degrees opposed requiring video delay
line to line up the two video fields in a video frame properly. This
complicates head testing as it is not always obvious even which set of heads
is used in any given mode.

An additional pair of opposing heads is required for HiFi VHS audio and
another one is present if the VCR has flying erase head. Usually, there is
only a single flying erase head - it is double width and clears a pair of
tracks (fields) on each pass. So, there may be up to 7 (or even more) heads
competing for space on the upper cylinder!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 18.2 "Are your videos heads really bad?"

No picture or snowy picture in play modes and/or failure to produce a good
recording may indicate dirty or bad video heads. First, make sure that the
VCR's tuner and RF modulator are working by viewing a broadcast or cable
channel. Next, refer to the section on @{"Video head cleaning" link "6.3"} and follow the
instructions carefully. If there is no change even after a couple of
cleanings, then your video heads may have problems. Of course, if your
inspection reveals any physical damage, you will need a new set of heads.

Indications of a bad video head include:

   o Any visible damage to the ferrite chips. Heads nearly always appear in
     opposing pairs on the upper cylinder (head drum). Any visible
     discrepancy between the chips in a pair is probably damage. Sometimes
     1/2 of the core breaks off leaving the windings dangling. Common causes
     for this damage are improper cleaning techniques or the use of damaged
     or spliced tapes. Use a magnifying glass and bright light to examine the
     heads but do not touch! By the way - improper splicing of broken video
     tapes is a good way to break video heads. Any kind of splicing should be
     avoided if at all possible. (See the section:
     @{"Recovering damaged or broken tapes" link "16.5"}

   o Excessive video snow which cannot be eliminated by the tracking
     controls. An image where more or less good video alternates with snow at
     a 30 Hz rate means that one of the 2 heads in a pair is either dirty or
     bad.

   o Excessive video snow or no picture on some playback speeds (SP, LP, EP,
     still) since different sets of heads (in 4 head or more) machines are
     often used for different speeds. If this is due to wear, then it would
     probably gradually deteriorate and not happen suddenly.

   o Inability of certain internal adjustments such as backtension to
     eliminate erratic tracking problems may indicate a worn video head.
     Horizontal bands of video noise may come and go at various places in the
     picture depending on what speed is being used or the playback location
     on the tape (beginning, middle, end). These may come and go in a
     periodic cycle.

   o Need to frequently clean the video heads even if you are only using new
     good quality (name brand) tapes. Video heads are normally self cleaning
     but very worn heads can tend to collect tape oxide resulting in a noisy,
     snowy, or totally missing picture.

   o You have just been playing a rental, damaged, or spiced tape and you
     notice any of the above symptoms.

If your VCR has HiFi audio, similar symptoms may apply to the HiFi audio
heads on the rotating drum. Noisy or loss of HiFi audio or erratic switching
between linear and HiFi audio may be due to bad HiFi audio heads (but could
also be a tracking problem since HiFi audio tracking can be even more
critical than video tracking).

However, many other problems can result in similar symptoms - video head
diagnosis is one of the most difficult to make (except for physical damage).

Some pros claim to be able to determine if a video head is worn by feeling it
with a finger. I can guarantee that you will not be able to do this, so the
set of guidelines given above is the best to go on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 18.3 "Need for video head cleaning"

When should you clean a video head? Only when symptoms point to a problem
with the head. See section on @{"video head problems" link "18"}. Periodic cleaning is not
necessary and may cause excessive wear if done with a head cleaning tape,
especially the dry kind which may be excessively abrasive. Frequent cleaning
by hand, while not damaging, still represents a slight risk since you never
can tell when you might do something you will regret!

VCRs should be cleaned periodically, but video heads usually do not need
periodic cleaning as the spinning heads performs a self cleaning function. If
it ain't broke, don't fix it.

I do not see any advantage in buying a VCR which claims to have automatic
video head cleaning. As noted, video heads are basically self cleaning in any
case. The automatic head cleaner is a foam roller that contacts the rotating
heads for a couple of seconds when the tape is loaded. In my opinion, this is
worse than useless as any crud collected by this foam may just be redeposited
on the heads during the next cleaning cycle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 18.4 "Video head cleaning technique"

Caution: Read the following in its entirely to avoid an expensive lesson.

As noted, improper cleaning can ruin your expensive video heads. The head
chips are very fragile and just rubbing them in the wrong direction (NEVER
use an up-and-down motion) can break them clean off.

Manual cleaning using the proper head cleaning sticks is best but requires
that you gain access to the interior of your VCR - i.e., take off the cover.

If you do not want to do this, you can try a wet type head cleaning tape. I
do not recommend the dry type as they are much more abrasive and may cause
premature wear of your video heads especially if used regularly. When using
the wet type cleaning tapes, follow the directions and - very important -
wait sufficient time for everything to dry out

Regular video head cleaning should not be needed! Therefore, the regular use
of a cleaning tape is not recommended. As noted, some cleaning tapes will
cause excessive wear to the video heads and no cleaning type can adequately
deal with other parts of the tape path anyhow. If you find yourself needing
to clean your video heads frequently, the video heads may be worn, the
backtension may be set too high, or you may be playing old or dirty
(literally) rental tapes.

To clean by hand, you will need what are called 'head cleaning sticks'. These
are covered by chamois and are safest. DO NOT USE QTIPS (COTTON SWABS). These
can catch on the ferrite cores and damage them or leave fibers stuck in the
heads. Qtips can be used for cleaning the other parts like the rollers and
audio/control head as described above but not video heads.

To use the cleaning stick, moisten it with head cleaner or alcohol. Pure
isopropyl is best, however, the 91% medicinal stuff is ok as long as you dry
everything pretty quickly. Don't flood it as it will take a long time to dry
and you run the risk of any water in the alcohol sitting on surfaces and
resulting in rust (very unlikely, but don't take the chance).

Gently hold the flat portion of the chamois against the upper cylinder where
it is joined to the lower (non-rotating) cylinder. Rotate the upper cylinder
be hand so that the heads brush up against the moist chamois. DO NOT MOVE THE
HEAD CLEANING STICK UP-AND-DOWN - you will break the fragile ferrite of the
heads - $$$$. Side-to-side is ok as long as you are gentle.

I know people who use a piece of moistened typing paper or a business card,
or even their Mark-1 thumb for video head cleaning but I would not recommend
these for a general service procedure!

(I suppose the only real requirement to prevent damage is that the material
have a fine enough structure and not have fibers that can get stuck in the
heads. So, the short list of acceptable materials is quite long - some more
effective than others. My concern for a general recommendation is that
people's interpretation of these requirements can vary quite a lot. If a
novice comes to me and asks what to use, I will say 'cleaning sticks'. Once
they understand the characteristics of the heads and their mounting, they are
free to use whatever works.)

Depending on how dirty your heads are, a couple of passes may be enough. Let
everything dry out for at least 1/2 hour. This process can be repeated.
However, one pass will usually do it.

In addition, inspect and clean the drum itself staying safely away from the
video head chips. The five fine grooves in the drum help control the air
bearing that the tape rides on and helps to stabilize tape motion. These
should be clear of dirt and tape oxide (DO NOT use anything sharp - the
moistened head cleaning sticks will work).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 18.5 "Advanced video head testing techniques"

Assuming cleaning does not help and you have the time and inclination, some
additional test can be performed to confirm or rule out a bad set of video
heads (upper cylinder).

To check the signal from the video heads you need a circuit diagram so that
you can locate the relevant test points and expected voltage levels in the
head preamp. This will be housed in a metal enclosure, usually right next to
the head assembly (at the rear). This should be done with an alignment tape,
but any known good recording should provide a reasonable approximation.

Other basic checks such as visual check with a magnifying glass, continuity
tests on the heads as well as power supply voltages in the preamp can also
help.

If your VCR has 4 video heads (not including HiFi audio heads) and only
certain modes or speeds do not work, then the following procedure may permit
you to isolate the problem to a head or its preamp. Basically, the idea is to
interchange the wiring of the two pairs of heads. While the heads will no
longer be optimized properly for each mode, there is a good chance that they
will work well enough to determine gross changes. For example, if SP play
originally had alternating fields of good and bad video and works moderately
well after this rewiring (but maybe with tracking noise), then you know that
the bad head is no longer being used for SP play. Since the same head preamps
are being used, a bad head must be at fault. Video drums where the heads are
wired with flying leads are somewhat easier to cross-wire than those with a
PC board. This is not fun and may not work in all cases, but if you are
hesitant to risk the cost of a new head, it may be worth a try.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 18.6 "Where to obtain replacement video heads"

Once you have concluded that a replacement head is required, you need to
decide whether you will undertake this yourself or take the VCR to a shop.
Video head replacement is relatively straightforward and low risk as long as
you are comfortable working on mechanical devices and take your time. A
little unsoldering and soldering is usually required.

Electronics suppliers such as MCM Electronics, Premium Parts, and Dalbani
stock a wide range of video heads for VCRs that are more than a couple of
years old. (They may not have heads for the latest models.) In some cases,
they will offer two kinds of heads for the same model - a generic version and
a 'name brand'. Unless you are extremely critical, there is probably no need
to spend the extra on the 'name brand' head. There is also no need to pay the
premium charged by the original manufacturer of your VCR - it is often priced
2:1 or more over what a generic head will cost with no substantial difference
in performance, if any. You may even end up with exactly the same head
manufactured on the same assembly line!

Note that currently, the price of many upper cylinders (video heads) for 2
head VCRs is well under $25 so ordering a replacement may be a better
investment of time and effort than a long diagnostic procedure especially if
the old head has high mileage and video quality has been steadily decreasing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 18.7 "Video head replacement technique"

  1. Do not touch the actual video head chips themselves. Handle the head as
     little possible. You can touch the upper part of the head cylinder if
     necessary. One thumb through the center hole with fingers resting on the
     upper edges works pretty well.

  2. Before you unmount the old one, mark or make a note as to its position -
     sometimes it is possible to mount the new head 180 degrees off from way
     it is supposed to be oriented causing tracking problems at the least as
     the opposing heads are not identical. (The azimith angles are +/- 6
     degrees for VHS).

  3. Unsolder the connections between the head and the upper cylinder. There
     will be 2n solder connections for an n head VCR. (Sometimes there is
     some kind of connector rather than solder connections, but this is
     rare.) Examining the new head should reveal exactly where to unsolder.
     For pins through the printed wiring board type, you should use some kind
     of desoldering tool - solder pump, SolderWick, or a vacuum rework
     station.

  4. Unscrew the 2 or 4 philips head screws holding the old head in place. It
     should be obvious from the new head which screws need to be removed. You
     may need to remove the static brush if your VCR has one or some other
     usually obvious stuff to get at it. DO NOT touch any other screws on the
     head drum as these are critical adjustments one should not mess with.

  5. Lift the old head straight up and off. You should not need to use any
     drastic measures though a little jiggling may help. I have never
     actually needed a head puller.

  6. Replace in reverse order, solder the connections, replace any other
     hardware that was removed. Refer to your notes on the position of the
     old head and/or the color codes (wire colors, dabs of paint, etc.) as to
     orientation on the drum.

  7. Carefully clean any fingerprints from parts of the head drum you
     touched. Again, do not touch the video head chips themselves. You may
     use 91% medicinal alcohol, though pure isopropyl is preferred. Avoid
     rubbing alcohol especially if it contains any additives. Let the machine
     dry completely.

  8. Unless you tweaked any mechanical adjustments, the VCR should work fine
     assuming the video head was the problem. If the tracking is way off,
     refer to your diagram and double check that you didn't replace the head
     rotated 180 degrees from the proper position by accident.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 18.8 "Can I substitute a video head from another VCR?"

The quick (and long) answer is: NO. The heads themselves are in no way
standardized. You can substitute a video head drum (upper cylinder) if it is
identical - VCRs sold under different labels are often manufactured by the
same few companies. Check a cross reference if you have a dead VCR with a
good set of heads but not the same model as the one you are trying to repair.
As far as the heads themselves, don't even think about attempting to
interchange the actual head chips - even if your replacement were physically
and electrically compatible, you would never be able to get the alignment
within tolerance since you do not have the factory jigs. Not to mention that
the head chips themselves are really really tiny and really really fragile
and their specifications all vary - head width, azimith angle, etc. Forget
it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 19.1 "General tape path alignment problems"

There are separate descriptions of the procedures for adjusting the various
components of the tape path - in particular, A/C head azimith, tilt, and
height; and roller guide height. Before you attempt these, you need to
determine whether either of these are likely to be your problems.

The following are some symptoms you may experience indicating the need for
A/C head adjustments:

   o Weak, muddy, or wavering sound. (Azimith, height, or tilt adjustment).

   o Tracking incompatibility between this VCR and tapes recorded on other
     VCRs - you always need to adjust tracking or keep the tracking control
     way off center when playing tapes from other VCRs. However, if it is
     only one other VCR, that VCR may be misadjusted. (Mechanical tracking
     adjustment).

   o Erratic loss of synchronization or frame lock, or speed changes. (Height
     or tilt adjustment).

Before you try to adjust the A/C head, make sure that there is not some
obvious mechanical problem that has shifted its position. There may be a bit
of something stuck in the mechanism. If this appeared after you did some work
on the VCR, you may have accidentally caught a cable or something else
preventing the A/C head assembly from returning to its proper position. This
is particularly likely if the problem happened suddenly.

Once you change its settings, any tapes recorded on your VCR prior to these
adjustments may not play back properly. For example, if you touch the A/C
azimith screw to correct a muddy weak sound problem when playing tapes from
other VCRs, any tapes previously recorded on your VCR will now sound muddy
and weak. You need to decide which is more important - your recorded tape
library or compatibility with other VCRs.

The following are some of the symptoms you may experience indicating the need
for roller guide height adjustments:

   o Video noise at top or bottom of picture that cannot be removed with the
     user tracking control.

   o Video noise in various areas of picture that comes and goes in a few
     second cycle.

   o A jumpy picture - as though the vertical hold control (which most TVs no
     longer have) is misadjusted.

Before you try to adjust the roller guide height, make sure that there is not
some obvious mechanical problem which is preventing the roller guides from
seating properly. This is particularly likely if the problems happened
suddenly. See the section below on:
@{"Likely causes for sudden change in tracking behavior" link "19.4"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 19.2 "Adjustment of A/C head - problems with tracking or sound (linear audio)"

If the problems happened suddenly, it is probably not a misadjusted
audio/control head but some other mechanical fault - eliminate this
possibility before considering A/C head adjustments.

The following will attempt to get your mechanical settings back to something
approaching normal even if the audio/control head was tweaked:

I assume that you have cleaned it and replaced any dead rubber parts.

I also assume that someone (we won't name anyone) has tweaked just about
every mechanical adjustment.

I would adjust the audio/control (A/C) head as best you can (don't touch this
unless you know it was messed up by someone):

   o Play a tape that you know was recorded on a good machine. It may be
     easier to start with a tape recorded in SP mode since this is less
     critical. Once the basic alignment is complete, go back and fine tune
     with a tape recorded in EP.

   o Adjust the A/C tilt as vertical as you can by eye. If necessary, fine
     tune it for most stable tape movement - the tape should be at the same
     angle moving over takeup roller guide, A/C head, and adjacent fixed I
     guide.

   o Adjust the A/C height for loudest sound. At each end of the range of
     this adjustment, you will lose tracking/sync and tape speed may
     fluctuate (in addition to the sound becoming weak).

   o Adjust the A/C azimith for best treble (high frequency) sound. This is a
     precise adjustment - a 1/16 of a turn is significant. There will be a
     very small range over which the sounds will be clear and natural. A tape
     with music is best for making this adjustment.

   o With electronic tracking control centered, adjust A/C mechanical
     tracking (usually, a conical nut that moves the entire A/C assembly)
     until you get the least snow (if you have a picture at this point).
     Satisfactory tracking may be obtained at several positions of this
     control. However, only one will produce current video-audio sync. For
     the others, the words and the picture will be off by some multiple of
     1/30th of second.

   o You may need to go back and touch up some of these again.

There can still be other problems in the tape path including the height and
angle of the roller guides and the height of the impedance roller assembly
(on the left before or after the full erase head.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 19.3 "Roller guide height adjustment"

You can do this by eye. Sophisticated test equipment and expensive test tapes
are not needed. One trick is of course not to mess with both guide posts at
the same time - but even if you do it isn't the end of the world. This
doesn't even require a scope - the video picture is an excellent alignment
tool! It does take patience and a steady hand.

Also, have you touched any other mechanical adjustments - other guideposts,
etc? Hope not. Also, I assume that any repairs to the guideposts have left
them perfectly vertical - if they are tilted, then other tape path
instabilities can result.

The following checks and adjustments are made in PLAY mode.

There is a ridge on the lower (stationary cylinder) on which the tape should
ride - not above and not below. Play a tape that is in good condition and
look closely at its bottom edge to see if it is sitting precisely on this
ridge. If it is not, first verify that both roller guides are snug against
the 'V-stoppers' - the brackets at the end of the tracks where the roller
guides stop in PLAY and REC. If they are not, then you need to determine what
is binding or what has fallen off of the tape loading mechanism. See the
section on: @{"General tape path alignment problems" link "19.1"} Assuming that the roller
guides are correctly positioned on the tracks, the first step is to visually
adjust the roller guides so that the tape just rides on that ridge on the
lower cylinder. That ridge is a very critical part of the guide mechanism.

There will be a set screw to lock each of the roller guideposts from turning.
The appropriate one(s) will need to be loosened slightly - just enough to
that the post is snug but can be turned by hand. The set screws may require a
miniature metric hex wrench. Some just have a square head screw which can be
loosened with a pair of needlenose pliers. Adjust each guidepost so that the
tape just rides on top of the ridge.

Now, for the fine adjustments. Which part of the picture is bad?

   o Left guide -> mostly problems with top of picture.
   o Right guide -> mostly problems with bottom of picture.

Misadjustment can also cause a periodic loss of sync on a several second
cycle.

Make careful SMALL adjustments of each one - then wait for a few seconds for
any results to become apparent. Since the tape moves so slowly, it takes
several seconds for the tape motion to stabilize to the new guide position.
The left guide will affect the top part of the picture (mostly) and the right
guide will affect the bottom.

Once you are happy with SP, get a tape recorded on a known good deck in EP
(SLP) mode since the tracks are narrower and fine tune it.

Tape path alignment comments:

  1. An EP recording requires the best tracking, and will thus make the best
     test source. (But it must have been recorded on a unit that was aligned
     properly).

  2. Using forward and reverse search modes helps to narrow the adjustment.
     The guide height on the "feed" side for whichever direction you're going
     will have more affect. In other words, tweak one while searching
     forward, and the other while searching in reverse.

  3. You could have the tape centered at the middle of the contact path, but
     too low at one end and too high at the other.

  4. You could have the entire contact path too high or too low, and be in-
     advertently "correcting" by misadjusting the tracking control. You could
     be off by an entire track getting a good but very unstable picture since
     the ridge is not providing any guidance.

Roller guide tilt: The roller guides (but not the fixed guide posts next to
them) should be perfectly vertical. Sometimes there is an adjustment for this
but usually not. Roller guide assemblies that have tilt due to wear will need
to be replaced.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 19.4 "Likely causes for sudden change in tracking behavior"

If it is impossible to find a position of the user tracking control that
results in a stable picture, this section is for you. Some amount of the
picture may be noisy - top or bottom - or the tracking may be fluctuating
with a few second cycle.

Mostly, these symptoms are related to problems with the roller guide
assemblies. (though electronic causes are also possible). The roller guides
are on the assemblies that move on curved tracks to wrap the tape around the
video head drum in play and record modes (and on newer instant start VCRs,
other times as well). Each roller guide assembly includes a white cylindrical
roller which should turn freely on a metal guidepost, and a fixed guidepost
at approximately a 20 degree angle.

  1. Roller guides not fully engaged against 'V-stoppers' (the metal brackets
     at the end of the track on which the roller guide assemblies move when
     entering PLAY or RECORD modes. Common causes:

      o Obstruction or ridge on track preventing guides from completing their
        movement. Visually inspect and observe behavior while entering and
        leaving PLAY mode. Sometimes with use, an edge develops and the guide
        gets hung up. A fine file can sometimes remove this.

      o Parts have fallen off (don't laugh - JVCs tend to do this). Various
        parts of the mechanical linkage that move the roller guides may
        loosen with use and either fall off entirely or change position
        enough to prevent full engagement. Compare left and right roller
        guide assemblies, they are usually nearly identical in their
        operation and you should be able to identify parts missing or out of
        position. These are usually on the underside of the deck and will
        necessitate removing the bottom cover (unplug the unit!). To gain
        access to critical parts of the linkage which may be obscured by
        circuit boards or other components, you may need to power the VCR,
        turn it on, press PLAY, and then pull the plug just as the roller
        guides are in the middle of the track and accessible.

        For the JVC problems, the parts are usually either a brass post or a
        plastic link. The brass post can be glued back in place using a drop
        of Epoxy. Make sure its shoulder is fully flush with the body of the
        roller guide casting. For the plastic link, I have used a very small
        screw to secure it in place from above. Some plastic cement may work
        as well.

      o Tracks on which roller guide assemblies slide are dirty and/or need
        lubrication. Clean and grease.

      o Obstructions such as toys or Cheerios blocking tracks.

Check the roller guides while the machine is playing a tape. They should be
firming pressed against the V-stoppers. Any looseness indicates a problem
preventing full engagement. If pushing the offending guide into position
fixes the tracking problem, this confirms the diagnosis.

Note that in modes where the roller guides are retracted, the roller guide
assemblies are relatively loose and free to move. However, the amount of
movement possible should be similar for the left and right roller guides and
you should not be able to lift either entirely off of the track - the ability
to do so means missing parts underneath the deck. If the missing parts can be
located, they can usually be glued back into position.

Warning: if you find a roller guide assembly that can be lifted off the track
DO NOT attempt to load a tape - the floppy roller guide assembly can smash
into the spinning video heads ruining them - and your entire day.

  1. One of the fixed guide posts next to roller guides (the ones that are
     tilted about 20 degrees) have worked loose and fallen off. There should
     be a tilted guide post next to each roller guide. If one is missing, it
     has probably fallen into the machine. Immediately unplug (to avoid the
     possibility of it jamming something and/or shorting components in the
     electronics). Locate the escaped post - turn the unit upside down,
     sideways, shake it, whatever until the loose post falls to the table or
     floor. Glue it back into position with a drop of Epoxy or other
     household cement.

  2. The backtension band has come loose or broken. The backtension band
     provides the force needed to keep the tape pressed against the video and
     audio head. A backtension lever on the left side just as the tape leaves
     the cassette is connected to a felt lined metal band that presses
     against the edge of supply reel. The position of the level determines
     the tension and is set up with mechanical feedback so that the tape
     tends to move it against spring force just enough to provide the correct
     amount. Test by moving the backtension lever a bit in each direction -
     you should be able to observe the tension change. Backtension bands are
     easily replaced. See section on @{"backtension adjustment" link "19.5"}

  3. Mechanical damage due to trauma such as VCR falling off of TV. Cure, if
     possible, will depend in extent and type of damage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 19.5 "Backtension adjustment"

Most VCRs use a backtension band - a thin metal band with a felt liner - to
apply a carefully controlled torque to the supply reel during forward tape
motion in play, record, and CUE. A backtension lever or arm contacts the tape
as it leaves the supply side of the cassette and provides feedback to control
the tension on the backtension band and thus how much it resists the rotation
of the supply reel.

If the backtension is too low, poor tape-head drum contact results and you
get a noisy intermittent picture.

If the backtension is too high, there will be excessive head wear and in
extreme cases, the drum will slow or stop entirely.

Backtension is normally set using a special backtension gauge which you most
likely do not have. If you own a TV with a vertical hold control, you can
adjust backtension by setting the vertical hold so that you can view the head
switching point - just above the vertical blanking bar. Above this point, you
see the video from one head and below you see it from the other. When
properly adjusted, these two segments should more-or-less line up.

There are two adjustments for backtension: a spring position and the
effective length of the band.

To set the length, there is a setscrew which allows the end of the band to be
moved back and forth. It is unlikely that you would need to set this unless
you have just replaced a band or unmucked someone elses repair attempt. I
usually consider the length to be correct when the angle that the tape makes
going around the lever post is about 90-120 degrees. In other words, the tape
should not be so tight as to not be deflected by the arm but should not be so
loose as to be near or at the end of its possible travel.

Then, set the spring force to align the picture above and below the head
switching point. If you do not have access to vertical hold, you may be able
to set backtension in the middle of the range where flag waving (see the
section on: @{"Flag waving" link "12.7"} is absent or minimized.

@endnode
@node 20.1 "Tape start/end sensors"

VHS cassettes use a clear leader and trailer for the purposes of detecting
beginning or end of tape. A light source that pokes up in the center of the
cassette illuminates photodetectors on either side of the cassette through
passages in the plastic passing through the tape as it leaves and enters the
cassette.

The light source can fail - this is common on older VCRs where this was an
incandescent lamp but rare on modern VCRs which use a special IR LED. The
failure of this light source can produce a number of symptoms:

   o The VCR may simply shut down and refuse to do anything. VCRs with
     incandescent lamps often were able to figure out that the light bulb was
     burnt out since it was drawing no current and then shut down or flash an
     error code.

   o The VCR may go through the motions of playing a prerecorded tape
     thinking that a tape is present because the sensors return signals
     indistinguishable from what it would see if a tape were present.
     Eventually, it may give up and probably shut off power.

   o The VCR may do strange things when you attempt to load a cassette since
     the microcontroller is receiving conflicting signals - the cassette is
     out but the sensors think otherwise.

If your VCR uses an incandescent lamp and it is not lit when power is on,
then the bulb is most likely burnt out.

If either sensor fails open, then similar symptoms may result.

If the sensor on the supply side fails shorted, then it will appear as though
the tape is at the end. The VCR may refuse to play or FF or will attempt to
rewind as soon as a cassette is inserted.

If the sensor on the takeup side fails shorted, then it will appear as though
the tape is at the beginning. The VCR may refuse to REW.

In both cases, sometimes you can trick the VCR into cooperating and
confirming that there is a sensor problem by pulling the connector for the
appropriate sensor once the cassette is loaded.

If you can get at the connectors, you can test the sensors by monitoring the
voltage on the outputs.

One test you might try if the VCR attempts to play an imaginary prerecorded
tape as soon as power is turned on is to locate the microswitch for record
lockout protection - it will be located near the front (where the record
protect tab would be once the cassette is loaded). Press this in while you
turn power on. If the VCR now just initializes and displays cassette-in
without trying to play, then it really thinks there is a cassette in place
most likely due to a faulty sensor.

In some cases, there could be other problems like a faulty mode switch or
microcontroller producing symptoms that might be mistaken for faulty
start/end sensors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 20.2 "Start/end sensor testing"

The start and end sensors are usually a combination of a light source (IR
LED) and IR photodiode. With a little effort, these can be tested for
functionality.

For an incandescent lamp (older VCRs), if it is not lit with VCR power on, it
is most likely burnt out. Test with an ohmmeter.

For an IR emitter, an IR detector like the circuit provided elsewhere in this
document or an IR detector card can be used to determine if the LED is
operating.

You can also try powering the LED with a low voltage supply and 500 ohm or so
resistor using the IR detector to see if it works. Disconnect it from the
circuitry first! Try both polarities to be sure you got it right.

The sensors themselves can be tested by disconnecting them from the circuitry
and shining an IR source on them (a remote control or incandescent bulb)
while monitoring the resistance with a VOM or DMM. Use the polarity which
give the higher reading (reverse bias). This resistance should drop
dramatically if they are functional.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 20.3 "Tape counters"

There are two kinds of tape position counters: reference and real-time.

What I call a reference counter is what all VCRs used up until a few years
ago. A sensor counts revolutions of the takeup reel (usually) either directly
or via a belt drive. A mechanical or electronic counter displays an arbitrary
number which provides some idea of location. Since the rotation rate of the
reel is not constant with respect to the actual time of the tape, it is not
possible to use this for anything other than a reference. In addition, the
tape may slip a bit and be wound tighter or looser depending on whether it
was wound in play, FF, or REW. Thus, even the reference is not accurately
repeatable.

Failures can be caused by a broken or weak belt for the mechanically operated
counter or defective circuitry for the electronic display. A failed sensor
would most likely also cause the VCR to shut down and unload the tape as this
is what is used to confirm that the takeup reel is rotating and that tape is
not spilling into the bowels of the VCR.

Real-time counters - which really are a vast improvement - operate off of the
control track pulses from the control head. Tape location is measured in
hours, minutes, and seconds though it is still relative and must be reset at
the beginning of the tape if an absolute location is to be determined.

One characteristic of the real-time counter is that it will not keep track of
location on a tape that has not been recorded (no control track). Therefore,
if you want to leave a specific length section of tape blank, you will still
need to lay down the control track by recording a blank channel or just
ignoring what you have recorded later when you go to fill it in.

Failure of the real-time counter on a VCR that otherwise works normally is
quite unlikely and is probably an electronic problem since the control head
must be functional for all record/play modes to work properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 20.4 "Reel rotation sensors"

Reel rotation is detected most often using optical sensors under the reels
though some older VCRs may use mechanical or optical interrupters driven off
of belts from the reel spindles.

There will always be a takeup reel sensor. It has two functions: to (1)
confirm that the reel is rotating and that tape is not spilling into the
bowels of the machine and (2) to operate the (non-real time) tape counter.

Failure of this sensor will cause the machine to shutdown almost immediately
and will result in a stuck tape counter.

Many VCRs will have a similar sensor on the supply reel. The output from this
sensor will be used to confirm proper rotation of both reels both during
modes involving tape motion as well as during the tape load and unload
operations.

Some fancier VCRs will display an estimate of tape remaining using the
difference in rotation rates of the supply and takeup reels based on
assumptions about tape thickness, hub size, and total length (which you may
have to tell it).

Sometimes, reel rotation sensor problems are simply due to accumulated dirt
on the reflective surfaces - clean them. In other cases, replacement sensors
will be needed. While you are at it, replace both sides where appropriate -
most of the cost to you is in your time, the cost of the sensors themselves
is modest.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 20.5 "Reel rotation sensor testing"

First, locate the LED and photodiode. You can tell the difference by testing
with a DMM on its diode test scale - the LED will have the higher forward
voltage drop.

Momentarily touch and remove a resistor (1K ohms or so should work) across
the sensor leads while the VCR is in PLAY mode before it quits. This should
make the counter change if the the LED is bad or the photodiode is open.
Alternately, a remote control may be able to activate it providing pulses
that will look to the counter exactly like reel rotation.

If this has no effect, unsolder the sensor (or unplug the sensor assembly
from the main board if there is a connector) and try the resistor across the
terminals where it was connected. If you now get a response, the sensor was
shorted (or the connection was bad).

If you do not get the counter to change in either case, there is a problem
with the electronics on the main board or a bad connection leading to the
main board. You will need to obtain the service manual or trace the circuit
leading to where the sensor signal is detected.

It is possible that the counter will only change when the microcomputer
expects the reel to be moving, so a test while in STOP mode may not be valid.

An alternative test is to use an ohmmeter across the photodiode on a high
ohms scale. Use the polarity which gives the higher resistance and shine a
light on the sensor. The resistance should drop dramatically with a bright
incandescent light (these put out a good amount of IR). If it is infinite in
both directions, the photodiode is open. If it is low in both directions, it
is shorted. You may be able to make a measurement while the sensor is still
in circuit, though other components may mask the resistance change. As noted,
the IR sensor/LED combination is often a pluggable assembly. Using my VOM on
a photosensor, I read infinite ohms with no light and 200 ohms with a bright
light. However, your mileage may vary.

@endnode
@node 21.1 "Types of motors in VCRs"

There may be anywhere from 2 to 6 or more motors in your VCR. Some designs
use a single motor to power all functions except the video head drum. Others
have separate motors for each function. Most typical are 3 or 4 motors.
Motors perform the following functions:

  1. Cassette loading (front loaders only).
  2. Tape loading (position tape around video head drum, etc.).
  3. Video head drum rotation (servo controlled).
  4. Capstan rotation (servo controlled).
  5. Takeup reel rotation (PLAY, REC, FF, CUE).
  6. Supply reel rotation (REW, REV).

The video head drum (3) always has its own motor. It is internal to the lower
cylinder or above the upper cylinder (except in the very oldest VCRs) and
directly drives the spinning upper cylinder.

Most consumer VCRs use a single motor for the capstan and the takeup and
supply reels. Some also use this same motor for cassette and/or tape loading.
Several possible types of small motors are typically used in VCRs:

  1. Small brush-type permanent magnet (PM) DC motors similar to those found
     in small battery operated appliances, CD and tape players, and toys may
     be used for cassette loading and/or tape loading.

  2. A similar but larger PM motor may provide power for the capstan and reel
     rotation and possibly multiple other functions (older VCRs).

  3. A single low profile or 'pancake' brushless DC motor may provide power
     for a direct drive capstan, reel rotation, and possibly multiple other
     functions.

  4. Brushless DC or 3 phase direct drive motors are usually used for the
     video head drum. Some of the very earliest VCRs used a belt drive for
     the video head drum.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 21.2 "Repairing small motors"

Aside from obvious mechanical problems and lubrication if needed, you usually
cannot do much to repair defective motors. If you enjoy a challenge, it is
sometimes possible to disassemble, clean, and lubricate a motor to restore it
to good health. However, without the circuit diagram, even knowing what the
proper voltages and signals should be on (2) or (3) type motors would prove
challenging.

The following are some of the possible problems that can occur with the basic
permanent magnet motors:

   o Open or shorted windings.
   o Partial short caused by dirt/muck or carbon buildup on commutator.
   o Dry/worn bearings.

An open or shorted winding may result in a 'bad spot' - a position at which
the motor may get stuck. Rotate the motor by hand a quarter turn and try it
again. If it runs now either for a fraction of a turn or behaves normally,
then replacement will probably be needed since it will get stuck at the same
point at some point in the future. Check it with an ohmmeter. There should be
a periodic variation in resistance as the rotor is turned having several
cycles per revolution determined by the number of commutator segments used.
Any extremely low reading may indicate a shorted winding. An unusually high
reading may indicate an open winding or dirty commutator. Cleaning may help a
motor with an open or short or dead spot but most likely it will need to be
replaced. Note that unlike a CD player which uses some motors constantly, the
small PM motors in VCRs are only used for loading operations and are
generally quite reliable unlee damaged by other problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 21.3 "Capstan problems"

Capstans are expensive especially if they are integral with the capstan
motor, but unless it is bent (very unlikely), or the bearings are totally
shot, or it is direct drive and the motor is bad, the capstan should not be a
problem as long as you CAREFULLY clean off all of the black tape oxide
buildup with alcohol and a lint free cloth or Q-tips. Don't get impatient and
use anything sharp! The black stuff will come off. A fingernail may help. A
dry bearing may need a drop or two of light oil (electric motor or sewing
machine oil). Sometimes, there is a bearing cover washer that works its way
up and interferes with the tape movement. Push it back down.

Some Sony VCRs have had problems with defective capstan motors resulting in
intermittent pausing or stopping of video playback when hot. The entire motor
or just the bearing assembly needs to be replaced in this case.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 22.1 "Why is a tracking control needed"

In order for the video to be read off of the tape properly, the spinning
video heads must be centered on the very narrow diagonal tracks. The width of
these tracks is as small as .019 mm. The actual reference point is not on the
video heads but the A/C head - several inches away. The control pulses put
down during record are used to phase lock the capstan to the spinning video
heads. The distance between the control head and the video heads determines
whether the required centering will be achieved. In the ideal world, the
distance would be identical for all VHS VCRs - that is the goal. It is part
of the VHS specification.

However, whether from wear and tear, or even if the technician doing the
setup in the VCR factory had an off day, this distance may not be quite
identical on the VCR that the tape was recorded on and the machine being used
for playback. Therefore, a way is needed to adjust the effective distance. A
mechanical control would be possible but not very elegant. Therefore, an
electronic tracking control is provided. This basically allows adjustment of
the time delay or phase of the control pulses from the control head during
playback. Record tracking is fixed. Actually, there may be as many as three
tracking controls: (1) the user tracking knob or buttons, (2) an internal
master tracking adjustment, and in fancier models, (3) an autotracking servo
system. (Note: tracking is always automatically reset to the default when a
cassette is inserted.)

@node 22.2 "Old clunkers and the march of technology"

It always amuses me to listen to comments about how anything older than 6
months (or 30 minutes) should be tossed in favor of some newer, more cheaply
made piece of crap. Yes, convenience features and HiFi audio have made newer
VCRs a lot nicer in many ways. But for time shifting and the kids, that old
clunker will do just fine, thank you. Some of the older VCRs will just keep
going and going and going and going with a cleaning and a few rubber parts
from time-to-time.

On the other hand, I had to repair my high-end (for 1990) moderately used
Mitsubishi VCR because a 10 cent plastic part broke (their cost, my cost -
$10) - clearly an exercise in design-to-fail engineering. For about .5 cents
more, it could have been built never to fail. The replacement part was
identical to the original, so I give it about 4 years.

@endnode
@node 22.3 "Can I add an S-Video input to my VCR?"

Possibly, but why bother? You will most likely be limited by the VCR's
circuitry anyhow.

All S-Video means is (1) a special connector and (2) separate luminance (Y)
and chrominance (C) rather than composite video.

In a VCR, you will need to bypass the input circuitry and get to the place
where Y and C are separate. This may or may not be possible depending on its
design.

It is probably not worth it as you will likely not gain much in picture
quality but if you really are determined, a schematic will be essential.

If all you want to do is allow for an S-video input, there are single chips
which will combine the Y and C into a normal composite video signal.

@endnode
@node 22.4 "Can a VHS VCR record single video frames at a time?"

It would be nice if it were possible to output still frames from a PC, for
example, to record computer animation on video tape. This would permit images
to be generated slowly and then played back in real-time.

However, there are a couple of problems with attempting to cleaning record
single frames on a consumer grade VCR:

   o Without moving the tape, only a single field (of the two interlaced
     fields in a video frame) can be recorded since the tracks for the A and
     B heads will be superimposed. I doubt that any VCR not specifically
     designed for single frame recording has any support for moving the tape
     in this manner.

   o The control and synchronization circuitry to cleanly switch the record
     for a single frame may not exist. This will depend on the model - the
     more sophisticated the editing functions that are supported, the more
     likely that this precision will be supported.

   o The VCR must have a flying erase head or you must use new or pre-erased
     tapes to avoid the rainbow interference on the first few hundred frames
     of any recording made over old video.

Other than that, there is no reason that the video writing circuitry cannot
be turned on during pause - some VCRs will do this if you go into record mode
while in pause.

Obviously, anything you can do from the front panel or remote you can do
under computer control. There could be hidden functions accessible via a
special connector or key sequence but you would need documentation for your
unit which may not be readily available, if at all.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 22.5 "Why is a special VCR needed for multiple video standards?"

A VCR is not simply 'analog playback' in the same way that an audio recorder
doesn't care whether you record classical or rock. The VCR must synchronize
to the video timing and demodulate the luminance and chrominance information
in order to lay down the tracks on the videotape. There are enough
differences among world video formats that while technically possible (and
such multiformat VCRs exist) it is not automatic - or free. The video timing
and modulation techniques for video formats like NTSC, PAL, SECAM, etc. are
sufficiently different that additional circuitry is necessary to handle
multiple formats. In the U.S. at least, there is not enough demand to justify
the added expense.

The technology of video recording makes interesting reading and the
sophistication of the circuitry and mechanism of a $200 VCR is quite amazing.

TVs are more likely to accommodate difference standards than VCRs. Even a
regular TV may be able to be used to play from a different standards VCR. For
example, NTSC 30/525 and PAL 25/625 use very similar horizontal frequencies
but different vertical rates and color encoding. Playback will be possible
(in B/W at least) if the vertical lock circuitry (or the vertical hold
control if there is one) on the TV has enough range. A simple color code
converter can then be easily constructed using a couple of chips and some
discrete parts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 22.6 "What is a delay line and where is it used?"

The question you originally asked might have been: What is this alien looking
thing in my VCR?

The object in question may look like a pentagonal shaped frosted glass slab
with two pairs of wires sticking out of adjacent edges. What it is, is an
acoustic delay line implementing a one TV line (1H) delay - around 63
microseconds (NTSC). The crystal is a shaped cavity and the polished edges
are acoustic reflectors. There are a pair of piezoelectric transducers - one
to launch a wave and the other to pick it up. The acoustic waves bounce
around in a zig-zag pattern which increases the effective path length, thus
the unusual shape.

Uses in a VCR include a comb filter and tape dropout masking.

The comb filter is part of the chroma circuitry and computes the sum of the
current and previous video lines during recording and playback. The acoustic
delay line therefore implements a delay of exactly one horizontal line. Due
to the various games that are played with chroma signal phase in the NTSC-VHS
system (as well as BETA and PAL), the end result is that chroma signal
amplitude is doubled and crosstalk between adjacent tracks is cancelled out.
This is because the chroma signal is always exactly in phase between
successive video lines but the crosstalk between adjacent tracks is always
exactly out of phase. The name 'comb filter' is derived from the shape of the
frequency response of the comb filter - its evenly spaced spikes look
somewhat like a hair comb and it is used to 'come out' the crosstalk
components of the chroma signal.

Another use for am acoustic delay line is dropout masking. The surface of the
tape is not always perfect - bits of oxide fall off or slight dips or bumps
result in momentary loss of head-tape contact. One way to minimize visible
streaks in the video is to replace the lost signal with video from the
previous scan line.

Nothing alien about it, just not your everyday electronic part.

@endnode
@node 22.7 "Why are there so many different design for VHS transports?"

Don't expect an amazing answer - this is a set of questions.

Why are there so many totally different designs to do basically the same
thing? I fully understand the pressures of cost and manufacturability.
However, it would seem that with VCRs, for example, every manufacturer (of
which there are only a limited number who actually manufacture the tape decks
themselves) and every couple model years has a totally unique design. You
would think that after almost 20 years of manufacturing VHS decks, the
technology would be mature. True, there have been advances with respect to
quick start, HiFi, and so forth. Nonetheless, the required functions have not
changed. And, for that matter, the performance of the typical mechanical deck
has not improved that much in the last 10 years or so. If anything, the old
designs seem to be remarkably robust. I can keep a 10 year old machine going
virtually forever by replacing the rubber every few years. I am not sure that
I can say the same of a modern VCR.

Is it only a matter of maximizing performance at a given cost or is there
something more? NIH syndrome? Maintaining control over repair parts and
service? Or, use of entry level engineers who might provide a new outlook on
the design?

@node 22.8 "Service center honesty?"

After taking your totally dead VCR into an authorized service center, it is a
month and still no diagnosis. When pressed, they finally 'discover' that a
diagnosis has been made and the estimate is $80.

The repair place is jerking you around. It should not take them as long as
you have experienced to make a diagnosis - especially if they are authorized
and have the service manual. They like the really easy problems like "My VCR
started eating tapes last week. Is it hopeless?" 50 cents worth of rubber
(idler tire), charge $50 - easy money. And they appear to be heros. To fix
the electronic problems you need at least the intelligence of a carrot and
time - and time is money. OK, so maybe they give a quick cleaning also.

If it were my VCR, I would bitch, moan, claim poverty, threaten to report
them, etc. But, get it back and fix it myself. I assume you checked the
fuses.  $80 dollars to fix doesn't sound like it could have been much more
than a fuse. With the typical markup on parts (4:1 for small parts), those
alone could easily push the bill to more than $80. The longer they hold it,
the tougher the problem seems so that when presented with the (larger) bill
the customer figures it is justified.

@node 23.1 "Advanced VCR troubleshooting"

If the solutions to your problems have not been covered in this document, you
still have some options other than surrendering your VCR to the local service
center or the dumpster. Fortunately, VCRs are among the most popular of
consumer appliances to be addressed by literature that is readily available -
at all levels of sophistication.

If you are tackling an electronic fault, a service manual with schematics
will prove essential. Some manufacturers will happily supply this for a
modest cost - $20-50 typical. However, some manufacturers are not providing
schematics - only mechanical and alignment info. Confirm that a schematic
(not just a block diagram) is included before purchasing if possible.

Howard Sams publishes Sams Photofacts service data for almost every model TV
that has ever been sold but their selection of VCRfacts is limited and the
newer ones tend to have strictly mechanical information. However, they are
worth a shot, especially if your local large public library subscribes to the
SAMs series as many do. Some of the older VCRfacts are quite detailed and
complete.

There are a variety of books dealing with all aspects of VCR repair. Some of
these only address mechanical problems (but, hey, this covers most failures)
while other are heavy into the basic recording theory and electronic
troubleshooting. Your local public library probably has some of these in the
electronics section - around 621.38 if your library is numbered that way.
Technical bookstores, electronics distributors, and the mail order parts
sources listed in this document carry a variety of these texts.

Here are a couple of typical titles which I have used (there are many others
and I am not necessarily recommending these above the others):

If you teach consumer electronics repair, I've run across a text that you
should check out:

Practical VCR Repair
David T. Ronan
Delmar/ITP publishers
ISBN # 0-8273-6583-7

I've looked at several VCR repair books in the past, and almost all of them
are very weak on the explanation of the mechanical problems in VCRs, which
account for 90% of the problems. This text does an excellent job of
explaining exactly how the tape transport system works in VCRs and what each
part does. It has lots of photos with parts clearly identified. It assumes NO
prior experience. I believe I could take a beginner student and let him walk
his way through it.

The table of contents pretty well describes it:

  1. VCR Operations & Controls
  2. Removing covers & getting started
  3. Understanding the videotape path (Also with a detailed appendix
     describing operation of tape load shuttles, video heads & drum, capstan
     & pinch roller)
  4. Video Cassette examination & repair
  5. Troubleshooting loader and Transport Malfunctions (Includes timing!)
  6. How to perform VCR Maintenance and common repairs
  7. How to align tape path and make adjustments
  8. Understanding basic electronics
  9. How to use a multimeter
 10. Electronic components
 11. How to solder
 12. VCR Power supplies
 13. Checking motors, optical sensors & remotes
 14. VCR Microprocessors & servos
 15. How a TV picture is made
 16. Recording on videotape
 17. Beyond standard VHS
 18. Using manufacturer's Service manuals
 19. Common audio and video problems
 20. Service considerations: The business side of VCR repairs

This is by far the best book I've seen on the subject.

(Please note: I have no connection with the publisher nor anything to gain by
bringing this to your attention.)

For basic mechanical problems, I could not have said the following any
better.

One of the best I have seen is called:

This book describes in a step-by-step fashion how to repair a VCR without
expensive test equipment or special tools. Fixes are described for different
machines by brand & model #, and there is also a list of parts suppliers.

I'm not affiliated with these people in any way - just impressed with the
book.

@node 23.3 "Determining belt, tire, and pinch roller specifications"

Belts are normally specified by their cross section - square, flat, round,
and their inside circumference (IC). The IC is used since it is virtually
impossible to accurately measure the diameter of a belt.

Assuming you cannot locate an actual part number, determine the type of belt;
square, flat, or round. If you do not have the old belt, this is usually
obvious from the pulleys. Most small belts (as opposed to V-belts on 1 HP
shop motors!) used in consumer electronic equipment are of square cross
section though flat types are sometimes found in the main drives of VCRs,
cassette/tape decks, and turntables (remember those?). Measure or estimate
the thickness.

The IC is always specified with the belt fully relaxed. This can be measured
by hooking the old belt on one end of a ruler and pulling it just tight
enough so that it more or less flattens out. Read off the length, then double
it for the IC. Get a new belt that is 5% or so smaller to account for the old
one be somewhat stretched out. Of course, if the belt broke, measurement is
real easy. Or, if you do not care about the old belt, just cut it and measure
the total length.

If the old belt decomposed into a slimy glob of jellatinous black goop or is
missing, you will need to use a string or fine wire around the appropriate
pulleys to determine the IC. Reduce this by 10-25% for the replacement. Very
often the match does not need to be exact in either thickness or length -
particularly for long thin belts. A common rubber band may in fact work just
as well for something like a tape counter!

However, there are cases where an exact match is critical - some VCRs and
belt driven turntables or tape decks do require an exact replacement for
certain drive belts but this is rare.

Some parts suppliers make determining replacement belts very easy with the
PRB system in which the part number fully codes the shape, size, and
thickness.

Idler tires are specified by their inside diameter, outside diameter, and
thickness. Some parts catalogs provide actual size drawings so that all you
need to do is match up your old tire to the picture. Since tires do not
generally decompose or stretch significantly and hold their shape,
measurement is usually quite easy,

Pinch rollers are specified by diameter and height along with bearing inside
diameter. The match must be exact so using the original manufacturer's part
number is best but generic replacements are available.

Parts suppliers generally provide quite complete cross references to their
replacement rubber parts and complete belt kits are available for most model
VCRs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 23.4 "Interchangeability of components"

The question often arises: If I cannot obtain an exact replacement or if I
have a VCR, tape deck, or other equipment carcass gathering dust, can I
substitute a part that is not a precise match? Sometimes, this is simply
desired to confirm a diagnosis and avoid the risk of ordering an expensive
replacement and/or having to wait until it arrives.

For safety related items, the answer is generally NO - an exact replacement
part is needed to maintain the specifications within acceptable limits with
respect to line isolation, X-ray protection and to minimize fire hazards.
However, these components are not very common in a VCR except for the power
supply.

For other components, whether a not quite identical substitute will work
reliably or at all depends on many factors. Some deflection circuits are so
carefully matched to a specific horizontal output transistor that no
substitute will be reliable.

Here are some guidelines:

  1. Fuses - exact same current rating and at least equal voltage rating. I
     have often soldered a normal 3AG size fuse onto a smaller blown 20 mm
     long fuse as a substitute.

  2. Resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, switches, potentiometers,
     LEDs, and other common parts - except for those specifically marked as
     safety-critical - substitution as long as the replacement part fits and
     specifications should be fine. It is best to use the same type - metal
     film resistor, for example. But for testing, even this is not a hard and
     fast rule and a carbon resistor should work just fine.

  3. Rectifiers - many are of these are high efficiency and/or fast recovery
     types. Replacements should have at equal or better PRV, Imax, and Tr
     specifications. For line rectifiers, 1N400x types can usually be used.

  4. Transistors (except power supply choppers) - substitutes will generally
     work as long as their specifications meet or exceed those of the
     original. For testing, it is usually ok to use types that do not quite
     meet all of these as long as the BVceo and Ic specifications are not
     exceeded. However, performance may not be quite as good. For power
     types, make sure to use a heatsink.

  5. Switching power supply transistors - exact replacement is generally best
     but switchmode transistors that have specifications that are at least as
     good will work in many cases. See the documents on "TV", "monitor", and
     "SMPS" repair for further info.

  6. Video heads (and lower cylinders) - generally not possible unless it is
     a very similar model as even the mounting is usually unique to a
     particular manufacturer and it may change from model to model. However,
     since, multiple brands may be manufactured by the same company,
     substitution may sometimes be possible - check a cross reference (e.g.,
     your parts supplier's catalog) for compatibility.

  7. A/C and full erase heads - may be possible if the mountings are
     reasonably compatible. However, there could be other unknowns like coil
     impedance drive requirements. The connectors are not likely to be
     similar.

  8. RF modulators - there is a certain amount of standardization. Therefore,
     if you have one that fits (or you can make it fit), this is worth an
     attempt.

  9. Motors - small PM motors may be substituted if they fit physically.
     Capstan motors - especially the direct drive type - are probably not
     interchangeable.

 10. Sensors - many are sufficiently similar to permit substitution.

 11. Power transformers - in some cases, these may be sufficiently similar
     that a substitute will work. However, make sure you test for compatible
     output voltages to avoid damage to the regulator(s) and rest of the
     circuitry.

 12. Belts, tires, and pinch rollers - a close match may be good enough at
     least to confirm a problem or to use until the replacements arrives.

 13. Mechanical parts like screws, flat and split washers, C- and E-clips,
     and springs - these can often be salvaged from another unit.

The following are usually custom parts and substitution of something from
your junk box is unlikely to be successful even for testing: SMPS (power
supply) transformers, interstage coils or transformers, microcontrollers,
other custom programmed chips, display modules, and entire power supplies
unless identical.

@node 23.5 "Suggested Parts Suppliers"

For general electronic components like resistors and capacitors, most
electronics distributors will have a sufficient variety at reasonable cost.
Even Radio Shack can be considered in a pinch.

However, for consumer electronics equipment repairs, places like Digikey,
Allied, and Newark do not have the a variety of Japanese semiconductors like
ICs and transistors, or VCR specific components like RF modulators, idler
assemblies, belts, tires, pinch rollers, video heads, etc.

The following are good sources for consumer electronics replacement parts,
especially for VCRs, TVs, and other audio and video equipment:

@node 23.6 "Other Sources"

(This section from: ac557@detroit.freenet.org (Ted C. Gondert)).

Look in the Thomson (a.k.a. RCA and GE) "VCR/Camcorder Sourcebook" TCE
publication # 1J9780 available from your local Thomson distributor. Publish
date October 1994 (maybe newer version is out now) This book lists the most
common parts for many brands and models of VCR and tells which Thomson or SK
parts fit. Also has some solid state parts listed crossed to Thomsan part #.
RCA VR470 uses belt #192179 or SKBK0516 and pinch roller #202113. Similar to
VR450 through VR475, made by Hitachi.

Service manuals for RCA/GE/Thomson are available from Thomson Consumer
Electronics publications, P.O. Box 1976 Indianapolis IN (317)-267-5799. Or
maybe their at 10003 Bunsen Way, Loisville, KY 40299.

Microfiche for VCR is about $10. Older model series are available by the year
for good prices. I bought 1985 to 1990 for $50 or so. I have the microfiche
for RCA VR470. Also looked through my file cabinet and found a printed
service manual for VR470 in excellent condition, only used once. Have extra
microfiche set for 1985 vcr including models VLT250 to VLT470, VLT600HF to
VLT700HF, VLP800 to VLP970HF. I'll sell those service manuals for a good
price maybe $15 or so? (will pay for shipping). Or I'll check with local high
school electronics class if they want them. Don't know if they are still
fixing vcr or not, last time I talked to instructor he said it was too many
problems and they were getting away from repair.

Tandy (Radio Shack) can order PRB belts and have a CD ROM to look up model #
belt guide. For just one set of belts, Radio Shack is much more accessible to
people then mail order with $20 minimum orders and shipping/handling.
