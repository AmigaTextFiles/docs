Invest in good tools.
     If you are into garage sales, you can often pick up excellent well
     maintained tools very inexpensively but be selective - there is a lot of
     junk out there. In the end, sub-standard tools will slow you down and
     prove extremely frustrating to use. Keep your tools healthy - learn to
     use a wet-stone or grinding wheel where appropriate (screwdrivers, drill
     bits, etc.) and put a light film of oil (e.g., WD40) on steel tools to
     prevent rust.

(From Tony (PDP11 Hacker))

Firstly, let me mention that repairing something is often more difficult than
doing a poor design to do the same thing. A trivial example - a 1kHz
sine-wave oscillator. Now, there are many ways to design such an oscillator:

   o LC (hartley, armstrong, colpits, etc)
   o RC (wien bridge, with assorted stabilisations)
   o Digital synthesiser (or even a DSP :-))
   o Round off and filter a triangular wave (which can be generated in many
     ways)
   o etc..

If you are doing a kuldged-up design, you can probably get away with only
knowing a couple of those, but if you are repairing something, you'd better
understand the one that was actually used. So, you have to understand the
circuit theory.

@node 2 "Chapter 2) Introduction"

This series will present case studies of selected repair problems from my
archives. (Archives sounds more impressive than scribbled notes and
schematics, doesn't it?). I hope that these summaries will be useful for
those of you are interested in tackling your own repairs. These will NOT be
of the form: "replace C418 when vertical size is reduced on HyperTech TV
chassis HT312". Rather, they will document specific but common problems with
TVs, VCRs, CDs, computer peripherals, etc. The symptoms, testing, diagnostic
procedure, repair procedure, and comments will be included so that you can
learn from my approach (and my screwups). If you want specific solutions to
well known or repeat problems with your RCA or Zenith, then the repair
professionals who frequent this group will be in a better position to help
since they work on many of the same line of equipment on a regular basis.
However, if you want to develop a general diagnostic approach, then this
series may provide some tips and insight based on theory and experience.

Not all of these will be exciting cast of thousands repairs. Many will be
mundain but will address common problems with consumer electronic equipment.
There will probably even be some of those 'dogs' that we all hate - the
problems that never seem to go away. In any case, these will all be based on
my true experiences with minimal embellishment.

@node 3 "Chapter 3) Some of My Rules of Troubleshooting"

Safety First
     You should know the hazards associated with the equipment you are
     troubleshooting. Take all safety precautions. Expect the unexpected.
     Take your time.

Always think 'what if'.
     This applies both to the analytic procedures as well as to precautions
     with respect to probing the equipment. When probing, insulate all but
     the last 1/8" of the probe tip to prevent costly shorts. (If I had a
     nickel for every time I have been screwed not following this advice...)

Learn from your mistakes.
     We all make mistakes - some of them can be quite costly. A simple
     problem can turn into an expensive one due to a slip of the probe or
     being over eager to try something before thinking it through. While
     stating that your experience in these endeavors is measured by the
     number of scars you have may be stretching the point, expect to screwup
     - we all can point to that disaster due to inexperience or carelessness.
     Just make it a point not to make the same mistake again.

How you approach matters.
     Don't start with the electronic test equipment, start with some
     analytical thinking. Many problems associated with consumer electronic
     equipment do not require a schematic (though one may be useful). The
     majority of problems with VCRs, CD player, tape decks, and answering
     machines are mechanical and can be dealt with using nothing more than a
     good set of precision hand tools; some alcohol, degreaser, contact
     cleaner, light oil and grease; and your powers of observation (and a
     little experience). Your built in senses and that stuff between your
     ears represents the most important test equipment you have.

If you get stuck, sleep on it.
     Sometimes, just letting the problem bounce around in your head will lead
     to a different more successful approach or solution. Don't work when you
     are really tired - it is both dangerous and mostly non-productive (or
     possibly destructive).

Many problems have simple solutions.
     Don't immediately assume that your problem is some combination of
     esoteric complex convoluted failures. For a TV, it may just be a bad
     connection or failed diode. For a VCR, it may just be a bad belt or
     idler tire - or an experiment in rock placement by your 3-year old. For
     a CD player, a dirty lens or need for lubrication. Try to remember that
     the problems with the most catastrophic impact on operation - a dead TV
     or a VCR that eats tapes - usually have the simplest solutions. The kind
     of problems we would like to avoid at all costs are the ones that are
     intermittent or difficult to reproduce: subtle color noise, the
     occasional interference, or the dreaded horizontal output transistor
     blowing out every 3 months syndrome.

Whenever possible, try to substitute a working unit.
     With modular systems like component stereos and computers, narrowing
     down a problem to a single unit should be the first priority. This is
     usually safe to do in such cases and will quickly identify which unit
     needs work. This same principle applies at the electronic or mechanical
     parts level. Note that there is the possibility of damaging the known
     good part by putting it into a non-working device or vice versa. This
     risk is most likely with the power circuitry in amplifiers, TVs and
     monitors, power supplies, etc. With appropriate precautions (like the
     series light bulb) the risk can be minimized.

Don't blindly trust your instruments.
     If your get readings that don't make sense, you may be using your
     equipment in a way which is confusing it. DMMs are not good at checking
     semiconductors in-circuit or the power transistor you are testing may
     have a built in damper diode and/or base resistor. Your scope may be
     picking up interference which is swamping the low level signal you are
     searching for (TVs and Monitors, or low level circuits in VCRs and CD
     players). Your frequency counter may be double triggering due to noise
     or imperfect signal shape.

Confirm the problem before diving into the repair.
     It is amazing how many complaints turn out to be impossible to reproduce
     or are simple cockpit error. It also makes sense to identify exactly
     what is and is not working so that you will know whether some fault that
     just appeared was actually a preexisting problem or was caused by your
     poking. Try to get as much information as possible about the problem
     from the owner. If you are the owner, try to reconstruct the exact
     sequence of events that led to the failure. For example, did the TV just
     not work when turned on or were there some preliminary symptoms like a
     jittery or squished picture prior to total failure? Did the problem come
     and go before finally staying bad for good?

@node 4.1 "Some basic hand tools"

Screwdrivers, common ...
     Screwdrivers of all types and sizes including straight, Philips, Torx.

Screwdrivers, Jewelers...
     screwdrivers - both straight and Philips.

Small socket drivers.

Allen (Hex) key
     Hex key wrenches or hex drivers. Miniature metric sizes for VCRs.

Pliers
     Long nose, round nose, curved. Both smooth and serrated types are
     useful.

Wrenches
     Adjustable wrench (small).

Wire Cutters
     Diagonal and flush. Linesman pliers.

Wire strippers
     fixed and adjustable. Crimp tool.

Alignment tools
     (at least a standard RCA type for coils).

Files
     Small set of assorted types including flat, round, square, and
     triangular.

Soldering equipment
     A low wattage (25 W) iron for delicate components (e.g., ICs, small
     parts), a medium wattage (40-50W) iron for heavy duty circuit board work
     (e.g., power plane connections, transformers), and a 100-140 W soldering
     gun for chassis connections. Three wire grounded soldering equipment is
     recommended but I do not consider it essential for this type of repair
     work. However, a temperature regulated soldering station is a really
     nice piece of equipment if you can afford it or happen on a really good
     deal. I consider fine gauge rosin core solder (.030 or less) to be best
     for most applications (e.g., Ersin Multicore).

Desoldering pump
     SoldaPullit or similar 'solder sucker' for removing components easily
     and usually nondestructively. SolderWick is also handy for cleaning up
     de-soldered connections. A vacuum rework station is not needed unless
     you are removing your soldered in 500 pin Intel P6!

     (From the Editor - for those in/around the USA only!)

     I have found the Radio Shack one-piece desoldering iron to be excellent.
     It's a 35Watt pen iron with a long tube, a vacuum bulb, and a tip. The
     tips are replaceable and come in copper or iron-plated designs. The
     later last a lot longer. I have de-soldered 24 pin EPROMs from 4 layer
     boards with EXCELLENT results. Of course, practice first on scrap.

Magnetic pickup tool
     You can never tell when you will drop something deep inside a VCR. If
     you keep a strong magnet stuck to your workbench, you can use it to
     magnetize most steel tools such as screwdrivers. Just keep anything
     magnetized away from the tape path and magnetic heads.

Hand drill, electric drill, drill press - one or all.
     A small bench-top drill press (e.g., 8") is invaluable for many tasks. A
     good set of high speed bits (not the 1000 bits for $9.95 variety). Also,
     miniature bits for PCB and small plastic repairs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.2 "Basic test equipment"

Obviously, you can load up on exotic test equipment. What follows are those
that are most used.

DMM and/or VOM
     I prefer to have both. A good old Simpson 260 is better in many ways
     than a cheap digital multi-meter. For most measurements, I still use a
     25 year old Lafayette (remember them?) VOM. I only go for the DMM when I
     need to measure really low ohms or where better accuracy is needed
     (though this can be deceptive - just because a DMM has 3-1/2 digits does
     not mean it is that accurate - check you manual, it may prove
     enlightening). The Simpson 260 also has a nice 5000 V AC/DC scale which
     the others lack.

     Scales for transistor, capacitor, frequency counter, etc. are not really
     essential. A diode test function on a DMM is needed, however, to
     properly bias semiconductor junctions. Even this is not useful for
     in-circuit tests or for some power transistors or transistors with built
     in damper diodes and/or base resistors.

     Make sure you have a good well insulated set of test probes. This is for
     your own safety as you may be measuring relatively high voltages.
     Periodically inspect for damage and repair or replace as needed.

     A high impedance high voltage probe is sometimes useful for TVs and
     monitors. You can build one of these which will suffice for most
     consumer electronics work.

Oscilloscope
     Dual trace, 10-20 MHz minimum vertical bandwidth, delayed sweep
     desirable but not essential. A good set of proper 10x/1x probes. High
     vertical bandwidth is desirable but most consumer electronics work can
     be done with a 10 MHz scope. If you get into digital debugging, that is
     another story - 100 MHz and up will be required. If money is no object,
     get a good digital storage scope. You can even get relatively
     inexpensive scope cards for PCs, but unless you are into PC controlled
     instrumentation, a stand-alone scope is much more useful.

     I would recommend a good used Tektronix or HP scope over a new scope of
     almost any other brand. You will usually get more scope for your money
     and these things last almost forever. My 'good' scope is the militarized
     version (AN/USM-281A) of the HP180 lab scope. This has a dual channel 50
     MHz vertical plug-in and a delayed sweep horizontal plug-in. I have seen
     these going for under $300 from surplus outfits. For a little more
     money, you can get a Tek 465 100 MHz scope ($400-700) which will suffice
     for all but the most demanding (read: RF or high speed digital) repairs.

TV set
     (color is desirable) and/or video monitor for testing of video equipment
     like VCRs, camcorders, laser disc players, etc.

VCR
     or other video signal source for testing of video monitors and TVs.

Stereo tuner
     or other audio signal source for testing of audio equipment.

Audio signal generator
     A function generator (sine, square, triangle) is nice as well. The usual
     audio generator will output from a few Hz to about 1 MHz.

Audio amp connected to a loudspeaker
     The input should be selectable between line level and mic level and be
     brought out through a shielded cable to a test probe and ground clip.
     This is useful for tracing an audio circuit to determine where a signal
     is getting lost.

RF signal generator
     For serious debugging of radio and tuner front-ends. These can get quite
     sophisticated (and expensive) with various modulation/sweep functions.
     For most work, such extravagance is unnecessary.

LCR meter
     A capacitor tester is desirable but I prefer to substitute a known good
     capacitor rather than trusting a meter which will not test under the
     same conditions as in-circuit.

Adjustable power supplies
     At least one of these should be of the totally indestructible variety -
     one you can accidentally short out without fear of damage. Mine is a
     simple 1 amp 0-40 V transformer and rectifier/filter cap affair with a
     little Variac for adjustment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.3 "Handy widgets"

These are the little gadgets and homemade testers that are useful for many
repair situations. Here are just a few of the most basic:

Series light bulb
     ... for current limiting during the testing of TVs, monitors, switching
     power supplies, audio power amplifiers, etc. I built a dual outlet box
     with the outlets wired in series so that a lamp can be plugged into one
     outlet and the device under test into the other.

Variac
     It doesn't need to be large - a 2 A Variac mounted with a switch, outlet
     and fuse will suffice for most tasks. However, a 5 amp or larger Variac
     is desirable. If you will be troubleshooting 220 VAC equipment in the
     US, there are Variacs that will output 0-240 VAC from a 115 VAC line.

     (From the Editor)

     DANGER!! Variac, an autotransformer, does NOT isolate you in any way
     from the 120V line! If you NEED isolation, please see next section.


120VAC ------------------    (120VAC output if here)
                         )
                        (
                         )
                        (
                         )
                        (
                         ) <--------------- OUTPUT 1
                        (
                         )
                        (
                         )   (0VAC output if here)
120VAC ------------------+----------------- OUTPUT 2

Isolation transformer
     This is very important for safely working on live chassis equipment. You
     can build one from a pair of similar power transformers back-to-back. I
     built mine from a couple of old tube type TV power transformers mounted
     on a board with an outlet box including a fuse. Their high voltage
     windings were connected together. The unused low voltage windings can be
     put in series with the primary or output windings to adjust voltage.

     (From the Editor)

     BTW, in the USA, used 250VA isolation transformer can be had for under
     $100... Sit down when you price new ones ;-)

Video cassette cheater
     This is the shell of a VHS or Beta cassette with all of the innards
     removed and most of the top and bottom cut out to permit access to the
     reel spindles and other rotating components of a VCR during operation.
     You can also purchase these at grossly inflated prices.

Degaussing coil
     Make or buy. The internal degaussing coil salvaged from a defunct TV
     doubled over to half it original diameter to increase its strength in
     series with a 200 W light bulb for current limiting will work just fine.

Tape head demagnetizer
     This could just be a coil wrapped around a common nail with its end
     protected with tape. Connect to low voltage AC. However, these are so
     inexpensive that you should just buy one. [Caution:] Do not use on video
     heads unless specifically designed for them. Some are strong enough to
     damage the fragile ferrite cores.

Clip leads
     Like woodworking clamps, you can never have too many of these.

Patch cords
     ... for audio, video, and telephone interconnection.

Printer
     Centronics printer and serial computer cables.

IR detector
     This can be a photodiode/LED circuit or IR sensitive card. Use for
     testing remote controls, IR LEDs in photo-sensors, and CD laser-diodes.

Flyback tester
     I use a 12 V chopper with a 10 turn coil to excite the flyback under
     test. This will identify most primary and secondary short type faults
     under near-operating conditions.

Insulating sheets
     For separating circuit boards when removed from the chassis. These can
     be cardboard, fiberglass, plastic, etc.

Insulating sticks
     For prodding to locate intermittents.

Small parts tray and container
     I always use a film canister or pill bottle for storing the screws,
     washers, and springs removed during disassembly. An ice-cube tray or egg
     carton makes a handy parts bin for temporary storage of small parts
     while you are working.

@node 4.4 "Basic Ancillary Equipment"

Various common items are useful for testing of the following consumer
electronics and computers. These will normally be used before and during use
of any actual test equipment. (Some of these were already listed under the
heading of 'test equipment').

TVs
     VHF and UHF antennas and/or VCR or other video source with both RF and
     baseband (RCA plugs) outputs.

VCRs
     A small TV (preferably color but a monochrome TV will suffice for many
     tests) and/or NTSC/PAL video monitor, antenna, known good video tapes at
     both SP and SLP speeds. Also, a couple of blank cassettes for record
     tests.

Camcorders
     Same as VCRs but in addition, a test chart, tripod, and lamps for indoor
     testing.

CD and Laser-disc Players
     A garbage CD and test CD (or Laser-discs). A garbage disc is one you do
     not care about if it gets scratched. A test disc does not need to be an
     official (and expensive) test disc - any known good disc will do for
     most tests. The garbage CD can even be an outdated CD-ROM - an audio CD
     player will usually read the directory of a CD-ROM just like an audio
     CD. An audio amplifier with speakers or headphones will be needed for
     the audio tests, or headphones if the unit has a headphone jack. A TV or
     video monitor will be needed for Laser-disc video tests.

Audio Equipment
     A set of known working stereo components consisting of at least a tuner,
     amplifier, and speakers. Headphones are also useful. For most purposes,
     an inexpensive setup is preferred since there is no telling what kind of
     abuse it may need to endure during troubleshooting. I suppose that a
     turntable may even be needed occasionally. A couple of pre-recorded
     audio cassettes are handy when testing tape decks. One of these should
     have a tone of known frequency recorded on an accurately calibrated deck
     for setting tape speed. Also, a couple of blank cassettes for record
     tests.

Microwave Ovens
     A cup of water for a load. A thermometer for power tests. Neon or
     incandescent bulbs with their leads shorted together can serve as
     microwave detectors inside the oven (though these may not always survive
     for very long).

PCs and components
     A working basic PC is useful to serve as a testbed for trying suspect
     components. I use an old 286 main-board with just enough to boot from an
     old hard drive. A set of known working basic PC peripheral boards is
     useful - SVGA, IDE and MFM HD and FD controller, I/O ports, sound card
     and speakers, 5-1/4" and 3-1/2" floppy drives, etc. A spare power supply
     - even one that is not an exact mechanical match - is also handy for
     testing. An old laptop (commonly used as a door stop) is useful for
     testing printers on location.

Computer Monitors
     A test PC is useful as a video source. Of course, it will need to
     support whatever scan rates and video types the monitor is designed to
     accept. Programs are available to display purity, convergence, focus,
     color, and other test patterns.

Telephones, answering machines, faxes
     A phone line simulator is useful for initial tests. A pair of normal
     phone lines will work but of course you will need to provide jacks where
     you are working and access (which may be difficult with teens in the
     house).

   o Light oil such as electric motor oil or 3-In-One. WD40 may be useful for
     cleaning or freeing rusted screws but it is not a general purpose
     lubricant despite what is claimed on the label.

   o Light grease suitable for fine electronics - must be plastic-safe.

   o Isopropyl alcohol (91 % medicinal or pure). Q-tip swabs for cleaning of
     everything BUT video heads; chamois head cleaning sticks for video
     heads. Note that sometimes plain water will work better for sugar based
     coatings. Tape head cleaner can be used for head cleaning as well.

   o Contact cleaner in spray can

   o Tuner cleaner and lubricant in spray can.

   o Degreaser in spray can.

   o Silicone heat sink compound

@node 4.7 "Parts"

I was going to attempt to make a basic list of recommended parts but this
quickly got out of hand. The list below is just a start.

The idea is to have enough parts available so that you do not need to raid
the local electronics store every time you want to try something. A good
source for many of the basic parts is dead equipment - their organs can live
on at your workbench.

   o Resistor assortment. Resistor packs for digital termination.

   o Potentiometers (variable resistors), assorted values.

   o Capacitor assortment - ceramic and electrolytic. Large high voltage
     electrolytics for power supplies.

   o Rectifiers - 1N4007s for primaries of power supplies. Microwave oven
     rectifier. Fast recovery rectifiers - for switching supplies.

   o Diodes - 1N4148 signal diodes.

   o Transistors (bipolar): small signal, medium power, high power audio, and
     horizontal output transistors. Obviously, this list could get quite
     long. A few basic types will suffice in a pinch.

   o Fuses - 3AG size (1-1/4"x1/4") - .5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 amp. You can always
     solder these across the smaller 5x20 mm fuses often found in consumer
     equipment these days.

   o LEDs and indicator lamps.

   o Wire: assorted colors of #24, #18, and #14 stranded and solid insulated
     wire. 75 ohm coax for video. Shielded cable for audio. Fine wire (e.g.,
     #30, bare and insulated) for PCB repairs.

   o Line cords, plugs, and other electrical components.

   o Assorted small switches - toggle, pushbutton, etc.

   o Various jacks and plugs such as RCA, phono, F, BNC, etc.

   o Small loudspeakers, headphones.

   o Hardware assortment including English and Metric screws, nuts, bolts,
     flat and lock washers.

   o etc., etc., etc.

@node 5.1 "Manufacturer's service literature"

Service manuals are available for a great deal of consumer electronics. Once
you have exhausted the obvious possibilities or mechanical problems, the cost
may be well worth it. Depending on the type of equipment, these can range in
price from $10-50 or more. Some are more useful than others. However, not all
include the schematics so if you are hoping to repair an electronic problem
try to check before buying.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.2 "SAM's Photofacts"

These have been published for over 45 years (I don't know for how long) and
are generally the best most consistent source of service info for TVs,
radios, some VCRs and other consumer electronics. There are some
Computerfacts but the number of these is very limited. The VCRfacts are also
somewhat limited and the newer ones tend to have strictly mechanical
information.

SAM's are often available (for photocopy costs) from you local large public
library which may subscribe to the complete series. If not, a large
electronic distributor can order the selected folder for you.

One advantage of the SAM's info is that it is compiled in a very consistent
format so that once you are familiar with one model TV, it is easy to
transfer that knowledge to any other. They provide waveforms at key locations
and DC voltage measurements almost everywhere. Additional info such as coil
resistance is often provided as well. The manufacturer's service manuals are
generally not nearly as complete.

(BTW, I have no connection with SAM's.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.3 "Inside cover of the equipment"

TVs often have some kind of circuit diagram pasted inside the back cover. In
the old days, this was a complete schematic. Now, if one exists at all, it
just shows part numbers and location for key components - still very useful.
Some TVs - as late as 10 years ago, maybe even now - included a complete
schematic with the product information and owner's manual. I have a 1984
Mitsubishi which has this. It is, however, the exception rather than the rule
anymore.

Microwave ovens almost always have a schematic diagram of the microwave power
generation circuitry pasted inside the sheet-metal cover. This will always
include the high voltage transformer, interlocks, rectifier, capacitor, and
magnetron. Since most microwave oven problems are in these areas, this is all
you are likely to need. The controller, especially electronic units, is often
omitted or only covered superficially.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.4 "Parts information"

I have found the most useful single source for information on semiconductors
to be the ECG Semiconductors Master Replacement Guide, about $6 from your
local Philips distributor. STK, NTE, and others have similar manuals. The ECG
manual will enable you to lookup US, foreign, and manufacturer 'house'
numbers  and identify device type, pinout, and other information. Note that I
am not necessarily recommending using ECG (or other generic) replacements if
the original replacements are (1) readily available and (2) reasonably
priced.  However, the cross reference can save countless hours searching
through databooks or contacting the manufacturers. Even if you have a wall of
databooks, this source is invaluable. A couple of caveats: (1) ECG crosses
have been known to be incorrect - the specifications of the ECG replacement
part were inferior to the original. (2) Don't assume that the specifications
provided for the ECG part are identical to the original - they may be better
in some ways. Thus, using the ECG to determine the specifications of the
parts in your junk bin can be risky.

@node 5.6 "Last Resort"

Finally, as with medical problems, an accurate diagnosis can only be made
with good complete information. Use your senses to their fullest. If you
decide to post to sci.electronics.repair or take the unit into a shop to be
repaired - the more complete your description of the problem the easier (and
cheaper) it will be to locate the problem. Include functional behavior or
lack thereof, mechanical and electronic sounds it makes, anything that is
related at all to the operation of the device in question. Sometimes
seemingly unrelated factors can be important. For example, the fact that your
officemate rearranged their desk and you monitor's image is now shaking.
Don't omit anything - even what you feel is inconsequential - leave that
judgment to the repair person. Also, what may have changed in your setup, did
you move the equipment recently or add a component? What about your cable
connections? Did you rearrange the furniture? When was the last time you know
it worked properly? What were you trying to do at the time of the failure? To
paraphrase a famous quote: 'The only stupid or useless information is that
which is not provided'. However, unless you really are sure of what you are
talking about, don't try to tell the repair person what you think the problem
is likely to be. Don't bombard them with buzzwords - any competent tech will
see right through that. You can be sure that if you mention that you suspect
the expensive flyback is toast, it will be diagnosed as bad. Let them do
their job. Listen carefully to their diagnosis. You should be able to tell if
it makes sense.

Posting to sci.electronics.repair is a bit different - speculation is safer.
There is enough cross-checking such that any gross errors in analysis will be
uncovered. There is also generally no profit motive. If your speculation is
totally bogus, you will find out quickly enough, turn various shades of red -
and learn from the responses.

@node 6 "Chapter 6) Safe Troubleshooting"

These guidelines are to protect you from potentially deadly electrical shock
hazards as well as the equipment from accidental damage when working on line
powered equipment including: TVs, monitors, and microwave ovens. With low
powered devices such as VCRs and CD players, you are much more likely to do
damage to the equipment than yourself.

Note that the danger to you is not only in your body providing a conducting
path, particularly through your heart. Any involuntary muscle contractions
caused by a shock, while perhaps harmless in themselves, may cause collateral
damage - there are many sharp edges inside this type of equipment as well as
other electrically live parts you may contact accidentally.

The purpose of this set of guidelines is not to frighten you but rather to
make you aware of the appropriate precautions. Repair of TVs, monitors,
microwave ovens, and other consumer and industrial equipment can be both
rewarding and economical. Just be sure that it is also safe!

   o Don't work alone - in the event of an emergency another person's
     presence may be essential.
   o Always keep one hand in your pocket when anywhere around a powered
     line-connected or high voltage system.
   o Wear rubber bottom shoes or sneakers.
   o Don't wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact
     circuitry and conduct current, or get caught in moving parts.
   o Set up your work area away from possible grounds that you may
     accidentally contact.
   o Know your equipment: TVs and monitors may use parts of the metal chassis
     as ground return yet the chassis may be electrically live with respect
     to the earth ground of the AC line. Microwave ovens use the chassis as
     ground return for the high voltage. In addition, do not assume that the
     chassis is a suitable ground for your test equipment!
   o If circuit boards need to be removed from their mountings, put
     insulating material between the boards and anything they may short to.
     Hold them in place with string or electrical tape. Prop them up with
     insulation sticks - plastic or wood.
   o If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits with power
     off, discharge (across) large power supply filter capacitors with a 2 W
     or greater resistor of 100-500 ohms/V approximate value (e.g., for a 200
     V capacitor, use a 20K-100K ohm resistor). Monitor while discharging
     and/or verify that there is no residual charge with a suitable
     voltmeter. In a TV or monitor, if you are removing the high voltage
     connection to the CRT (to replace the flyback transformer for example)
     first discharge the CRT contact (under the insulating cup at the end of
     the fat red wire). Use a 1M-10M ohm 1W or greater wattage resistor on
     the end of an insulating stick or the probe of a high voltage meter.
     Discharge to the metal frame which is connected to the outside of the
     CRT.
   o For TVs and monitors in particular, there is the additional danger of
     CRT implosion - take care not to bang the CRT envelope with your tools.
     An implosion will scatter shards of glass at high velocity in every
     direction. There are several tons of force attempting to crush the
     typical CRT. Always wear eye protection.
   o Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered and
     unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped
     locations or difficult to access locations.
   o If you must probe live, put electrical tape over all but the last 1/16"
     of the test probes to avoid the possibility of an accidental short which
     could cause damage to various components. Clip the reference end of the
     meter or scope to the appropriate ground return so that you need to only
     probe with one hand.
   o Perform as many tests as possible with power off and the equipment
     unplugged. For example, the semiconductors in the power supply section
     of a TV or monitor can be tested for short circuits with an ohmmeter.
   o Use an isolation transformer if there is any chance of contacting line
     connected circuits. A Variac(tm) is not an isolation transformer! The
     use of GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet is a
     good idea but will not protect you from shock from many points in a line
     connected TV or monitor, or the high voltage side of a microwave oven,
     for example. A circuit breaker is too slow and insensitive to provide
     any protection for you or in many cases, your equipment.
   o Don't attempt repair work when you are tired. Not only will you be more
     careless, but your primary diagnostic tool - deductive reasoning - will
     not be operating at full capacity.
   o Finally, never assume anything without checking it out for yourself!
     Don't take shortcuts!

@node 7.1 "Some practical advice"

  1. Make sure it's not 'finger trouble' - and that the fault actually
     exists. A lot of modern stuff is complicated to use, and faults may
     appear to be present, which are actually due to incorrect operation.

  2. Try and get the schematic (see below). Read and understand them

  3. Before going ANY further check the supply rails with a voltmeter, and
     preferably also an oscilliscope ('scope). About 90% of all faults, in my
     experience, are due to PSU problems of one kind or another.

  4. A visual inspection helps, as a lot of faults, particularly in VCRs etc
     are mechanical in nature.

  5. 'Stock Faults'. These are the common troubles that come up time and
     again in the same equipment - the 470uF capacitor in the Philips G11 TV,
     the STK-series regulators in VCR power units, etc. If you can find a
     list, it's worth going over these points first, but don't think that
     such a list will cure ALL problems.

  6. Now's the time to start real fault-finding, and where it's difficult to
     give many hints. Basically, you should try and divide the system up into
     functional sections, and trace the signal through each one. When you
     find the faulty block, you then home in on the faulty component.

  7. If you're in the UK, buy a copy of 'Television' magazine. It's available
     from W.H. Smiths. Even if you don't repair TV and video equipment, the
     hints and tips in there will help you with other faults. It taught me
     how to fix switch-mode PSUs anyway. Adverts in the back give suppliers
     of service data as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.2 "Where to get service data"

  1. Try the manufacturer - some will supply it, or will tell you an agent
     who will sell you a manual. Expect to pay between 10 pounds and 30
     pounds for a service manual for consumer electronics stuff in the UK.
  2. The UK company Mauritron also sell (official) copies of service manuals
     for a lot of stuff, including vintage radios, TVs, VCRs, home computers,
     test gear, etc.
  3. Post here, to sci.electronics.repair :-)
  4. In the UK, there are yearly books containing the circuits of all TV's ,
     VCR's, and radios/audio stuff introduced in that year. They're
     expensive, but some main public libraries keep at least some of them -
     the Bristol City Library keeps the TV volumes. They sometimes turn up in
     2nd hand book shops for about 15 pounds a volume. These books contain
     the circuits and some notes, extracted from the official manual. They're
     not as good as that manual, but are a lot better than nothing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.3 "Where to get parts"

Standard parts
     Resistors, common ICs, etc. Almost any electronics supplier keeps these
     - e.g. Maplin in the UK.
Custom-ish parts
     Like the Philips range of TV ICs that turn up in all sorts of stuff.
     There are companies that keep these, look in Television for adverts.
Custom chips
     You have to go to the manufacturers or agents for these, and hope they
     will supply. Or, alternatively, redesign the system round common
     components, which is a right pain to do!
Safety components
     Fuses, fusible resistors, HV assemblies, etc. You MUST use the original
     replacement part here, especially if you are repairing it for someone
     else - to do otherwise risks a lawsuit! If you are repairing for
     yourself, you may be able to substitute, but note that you'd better know
     what you're doing, or you may invalidate your fire insurance.

@node 7.4 "Test Equipment, general and specialized"

The most useful equipment IMHO is:

Multimeter
     AVO, DMM, VOM, call it what you will. I'm sure we all know what this is
     for, and how useful it can be. But, there are tricks to using one in
     some circumstances, which I may post later.

Oscilloscope
     Strangely, not as useful as many think, but I still use it a lot. It's
     nice to be able to trace waveforms, and look at ripple on PSU lines.

Logic probe
     Very useful, especially in tracing simple digital systems (VCR System
     Control (syscon), computer peripherals, etc. I would NOT want to be
     without mine.

Continuity tester
     A lot of faults are due to bad connections, cracked tracks, etc, and a
     quick way of 'buzzing them out' is a great time-saver. Many multimeters
     have a suitable function built-in.

     [filip: see an application note of the LM3909 LED flasher chip for this
     purpose!]

Logic analyser
     Expensive, but if you do a lot of chip-level computer repairs, as I do,
     very useful. If you have one, you probably know how to use it, and
     should be posting here :-)

EHT voltmeter
     Preferably 0-40kV for checking the EHT voltage on TV/monitor CRTs. If
     you do such repairs, it's useful to be able to check the EHT is present,
     which also indicates the fylback side is working correctly.

Transformer tester
     There was a design published in Television last year, basically, form an
     LC resonant circuit with the coil under test, excite it with a pulse
     train, and look at the decaying oscillations on a 'scope. A single
     shorted turn anywhere in the transformer will majorly damp the
     oscillations, and is easily visible on the 'scope. Since such faults
     will kill Line Output (horizontal output) transistors or chopper
     transistors, it's very useful to be able to eliminate the transformer
     early on.

Special stuff
     Exercisers, Diagnostic boxes, etc. I find these to be a waste of time
     and space in general. Probably very useful in a commercial environment -
     where you are repairing the same thing time after time, but for the home
     user, spend your money on the other instruments, and work out a way to
     do without the special stuff.

@node 8 "Chapter 8) Daisy Wheel Printer - Carriage gets stuck"

Patient
     Panasonic KX-P3131 Daisy Wheel PC printer.

Symptoms
     After some random amount of printing, the carriage would get stuck and
     just twitch instead of moving across the platen.

Testing
     Using its internal test function, I let it print out until the problem
     ocurred.

Once the problem ocurred, the carriage would just kind of twitch back and
forth. Grabbing it, it was obvious that the stepper motor was providing no
effective power. Since this is usually indicative of a missing phase to the
stepper motor, I immediately suspected either:

  1. Bad connection - cable or soldering.
  2. Bad driver.
  3. Bad motor.

Since it was intermittent with no relationship to time, heat, position, etc.,
this is most likely (1).

I then removed the cover to gain access to the circuit board and motor
connections. It was necessary to defeat the cover interlock to get it to come
one. Now, to get it to screw up again.

I left it printing out the ASCII character set and got a byte to eat. When I
came back it was busy gouging a hole in the paper. So now for the critical
test: Will pressing on the stepper motor connector cause a change? The answer
is --- Yes! The carriage started moving again meaning that it is likely a bad
connection.

Of course, to gain access to the underside of the circuit board required
removing a zillion screws and the entire mechanical assembly. But once this
was accomplished - immediate gratification. There were obvious bad solder
joints around several pins of the stepper motor connector. I resoldered these
and few others that were suspicious and inspected the rest of the board. If
only I could remember which screws went where! Apparently, the continuous
vibration of the assembly eventually caused the connections to fail. This is
not likely a heat related problem though it could be just plain bad quality
control.

Once reassembled, I left it happily printing out page after page of ACSII
characters. Then, just to be sure, I connected an old laptop and printed a
few pages of Repair Notes.

Comments: This is one of those dream problems since their solution is so
obvious and so definitive. There is no doubt that the cure will last.
Unfortunately, the tough 'dogs' are the ones you lose hair over.

@node 9 "Chapter 9) Panasonic PV1461 VCR with Dead Power Supply"

Patient
     Garage Sale Panasonic PV1461 VCR (Asked $10, offered and accepted $5).

Symptoms
     The power supply had been identified as being bad by the seller.

Testing
     I plugged it in - nothing as expected. This was to verify that all
     functions and display were dead.

I removed cover and found that the main fuse had been removed. Hmmm, this
usually means catastrophic power supply problem. This is the typical
Panasonic switching power supply. Well, I have completely rebuilt these, so
no biggie. (Of course, there was one I blew up, but that is another story).

The hardest part was removing the power supply. It is buried underneath the
bottom circuit board necessitating the removal of this board and the front
panel. Do you think they design these things this way to discourage
tampering?  There was plastic in specific places to prevent removal from the
top even though it would have been trivial to design for easy removal. I
disconnected power supply from VCR. Fortunately, this was just a connector.

I tested across switchmode power transistor with ohmmeter - dead short C-B-E.

I looked in ECG for 2SC3890 - ECG379 with that infamous # indicating an
electrical but not mechanical match.. Since I had some BU406s, I looked this
number up in ECG guessing that the BU406 would be have similar ratings and be
usable in a small switcher - guess what, ECG379. The difference is that the
2SC3890 is totally plastic while the BU406 is a metal tab TO220. OK, so I cut
out a bit of mica to serve as an insulator and used a nylon screw. This is
temporary as I intend to get the proper replacement (2SC3890 - $2.15 from MCM
Electronics).

I also checked continuity from the main filter cap to the C and E leads of
the transistor to rule out a blown fusable emitter resistor. I checked other
semiconductors as well - all fine as far as my VOM was concerned.
Fortunately, the only casualty seems to have been the transistor and the fuse
was fast enough to prevent any damage due to its shorting.

To power up the supply, I initially used a Variac with a 25 W light bulb in
series with the line. Note that since I do not have any 1.6 A fuses, the fuse
is shorted. The light bulb will provide the current limiting for now. I use
my dual outlet widget box plugging in the supply to one outlet and a lamp
with the 25W light bulb into the other (the outlets are wired in series for
exactly this sort of application). This whole rig was plugged into an
isolation trasformer for safety.

I then identified the primary output and connected my VOM to this. It would
be in the range 5-15 V, probably 12 V based on the filter capacitors (16 V).

All set? Crank up power. Output comes up to about 13 V at around 50 VAC in.
Light Bulb hardly flickered. If it had not stopped in the 12 V range, this
would either indicate that there was a problem in the regulation or that a
load was needed. Had this happened, I would have put a 22 ohm 5W resistor on
this output and retested. Cranking up the Variac to full voltage causes no
noticeable change to output.

OK, connect VCR. Lights, VCR, power! Nothing. Light bulb is now glowing but
there is no indication of life from front panel and no action from motors.

Hmmmm.

Examining the nameplate, the expected power consumption is 29 W which is way
more then one can get through a 25 W light bulb. (Expect to be able to draw
maybe half of the bulb's ratings). So I go hunting for a 60 W light bulb.

This time the motors twitch and the front panel comes alive. Inserting a tape
and holding my breath - tape starts to load but then aborts with poweroff. Go
for it! The Variac had been set at about 90 VAC, so I crank it up to 120. Now
everything works. I go dig up a TV and verify that the basic functions are
ok.  Doesn't appear to even need much cleaning. Even the idler tire appears
to be in good condition.

Add a 2SC3890 and box of 1.6 A fuses to my next MCM order.

Comment: This is the sort of repair that might not pay for a professional
shop to undertake. The time to disassemble the VCR, identify the problem,
replace the transistor and fuse, and verify correct operation could be
excessive, or at least has the potential to be excessive. If it turned out to
be more than a transistor and fuse or was beyond repair, they might have to
eat the cost in time and materials. In addition, there is no real way to
guarantee that other marginal components won't cause the problem to repeat a
week or month in the future. Upgrade/repair kits are available for these
supplies and would probably represent the lowest risk investment for a
permenant repair. No doubt, the previous owner had taken it in for repair and
been quoted a rediculous price to replace the entire power supply module.

@node 10 "Chapter 10) USR Data Modem Won't Dial"

Patient
     USR 14.4 K baud external data modem.

Symptoms
     Modem works in most respects but when it goes to dial, the tones are
     superimposed on the dialtone which never goes away.

Testing
     I plugged it into an old laptop kept for the specific purpose of testing
     of random external peripherals. Indeed, the AT commands worked just fine
     but tone dialing did not work. Interestingly, pulse dialing would work
     90% of the time but a connection was never completely established.

At this point, I put a scope on each side of the 600 ohm coupling
transformer. A normal 2 or 3 volt p-p signal was present on the logic side of
the transformer during dialing. However, a much attenuated signal was present
on the phone line side - probably .2 V p-p or so. I probably could have used
a set of crystal headphones to just listen to the relative amplitudes of the
logic and phone line side signals instead of a scope. (Magnetic headphones
would have too low an input impedance.)

On a hunch, I did try replacing the transformer with one from my junkbox but
as expected, this produced no change.

The phone line is a nasty place for electronic components - 90 V ringing
signal, lightning strikes, pickup of EMPs (from nuclear bombs), etc. The
first place to look for fried components is therefore the phone line
circuitry. For a modem and no schematics, with the possible exception of the
power supply, it is also probably the only place where there is any real
chance of finding a problem.

Since there are a manageable number of discrete parts that connect the phone
line to the transformer, an ohmmeter check was in order. Unfortunately, many
of them were really itty bitty surface mount parts. After a couple of
go-arounds, this proved to bear fruit as an SO23 device marked on the circuit
board as a diode turned out to be shorted though I seem to have missed it on
my first pass. Carefully unsoldering the almost microscopic part confirmed
that it had turned into a dead short.

Note: markings for these devices were not always complete. Nonetheless, basic
ohmmeter checks could be made with enough confidence to tentatively eliminate
all except the single shorted diode.

Removing the diode and retesting proved that dialout was possible and that
normal communications at 14.4 K baud was normal. The markings on the diode
did not permit me to identify whether it was a simple diode or a zener. I
still do not know what function the diode actually served.

I replaced it with a 1N4148. The modem has been tested to confirm that it is
not damaged by the ringing voltage. Since the application does not require
dial-in access, I do not know if there is still a problem with this mode.

Comments: Where a problem can be narrowed down to a small section of
circuitry, ohmmeter tests can prove successful in identifying parts that have
failed shorted or open. This may be the only option when confronted with a
device for which obtaining a schematic would be difficult or impossible - or
not worth the effort. While we might consider a modem to be a throwaway item
these days, the time need to do basic testing of the phone line side
components is minimal and, as in this case, may be all that is needed.

@node 11 "Chapter 11) RCA 26" TV Very Dead"

Patient
     RCA 26" TV, Chassis CTC131A/M. Garage sale acquisition ($5). Previous
     owner explained that it failed to work after power was restored
     following a power outage due to a thunderstorm. They were more than
     happy to have me remove it from their garage.

Symptoms
     Dead. Located fuse - blown due to short (not overload). Blackened inside
     glass. Note: appearance of blown fuses is very significant.

Testing
     Replaced fuse. This was in hindsight a mistake without using a series
     light bulb to limit the current. The new fuse did not blow but the
     lights dimmed momentarily. Apparently a fusable resistor had sacrificed
     itself to protect the fuse.

Without schematics, I decided to trace the AC line circuits. These were
partially buried inside a metal box with some big fat resistors on a separate
board.

Measuring across the power resistors revealed that one 2.7 ohm resistor was
now open. That explained the new failure. Some further searching located a
TO3 power transistor inside the metal shield. Measuring C-E came up 0 ohms.
This was not the horizontal output transistor but was rather in the power
supply - a flyback switching supply separate from the deflection circuits.

The transistor was marked with an RCA part number. My handy dandy ECG
Semiconductor Master Substitution guide listed it as a typical 350/800 volt
switching transistor. I did not have an exact replacement but figured that a
horizontal output transistor would probably work at least temporarily in this
application, so I used my favorite BU208A in its place.

As a temporary substitute for the fusable 2.7 ohm resistor, I put in a
regular power resistor with the understanding that a safe replacement would
be installed before the TV was buttoned up.

Now for the test. This would be classic use for a series light bulb and/or
variac for the initial power on. However, for whatever reasons, I did not
bother - and lucked out in this case. The TV came on just fine. The only
adjustments needed were to focus and horizontal position - totally unrelated
to the original problem.

The recommended ECG replacement for the chopper transistor was an ECG385, a
350 V 10 A switching transistor. I elected to put in an ECG386 to give myself
a little extra margin. The ECG386 is rated at 500 V and 20 A. Other
specifications were similar or superior.

Comment: Since most modern consumer electronics are powered all the time even
if the power switch is off, it is always a good idea to unplug everything
during a lightning storm or if a blackout occurs. A nearby lightning strike
can easily impose huge transients on the AC line. When power is restored
following a failure, the initial power-on may not be clean including
mini-brownouts, spikes, multiple cycles, etc. These are all hard on switching
supply based equipment. Now, I fully realize that few of ua actually follow
this advise. (Of course, other screwups can result in similar damage. I once
was given a bag of dead stuff from a friend of a friend who had been doing a
little wiring in his house. Somehow he managed to connect 240 V to a 120 V
circuit - only for a second....)

This is one example where a failure with the most catastrophic impact on
performance (it was dead, after all) has among a very simple solution
(transistor, resistor, fuse). I much prefer these to the 'color noise on
channels in the UHF band' variety.

@node 12 "Chapter 12) Pioneer CD Changer will not Recognize Disc"

Patient
     Pioneer PDM601 6 Disc CD Changer rejects all CDs.

Symptoms
     Disc is loaded from cassette, disc spins at various speeds for about 5
     seconds, then it gives up, unloads this disc and loads next until there
     are no more.

Testing
     Testing consisted of removing cover and observing behavior. Everything
     appears to happen normally except that disc directory is never read.

This is one of those problems that has an obvious cause and solution once
experienced, diagnosed, and repaired the first time. I will outline my
approach the first time I came across this one describing this particular
case history from the perspective of the novice wannabe repair expert.

Since the disc is loaded and spins, it is likely that the laser and focus
servo are functioning (though perhaps no guarantee, but I hope to get to that
in another episode).

At first, I suspected (incorrectly) that an adjustment was needed, so I did
what I always now warn against - turning any of the internal controls. I
thought that they had been returned to the original settings but was not
positive.

Pioneer CD players usually include a test function - a button on the main
circuit board marked 'TEST'. Normally, test functions are invoked either by
simply depressing the button or by holding it depressed when power is turned
on. In this case I discovered that if this button were depressed when the
unit was switched on, the display would change and certain front panel
buttons would now function controlling the servo circuits directly.

(Note that the approximate duration of the previous paragraph was about 1
year as I put the thing aside unable to make any headway during the first
go-around.)

After some experimentation with the front panel controls, I came to the
conclusion that:

   o STOP turns all servos OFF.
   o TRACK FWD enable FOCUS servo (and loads disc 1 in changer).
   o PLAY enables SPINDLE servo.
   o PAUSE enables TRACKING servo (and PLAY mode).
   o MANUAL SEARCH FWD or REV to move Laser head.

Playing with these for awhile revealed that it was possible to move the laser
pickup, engage the focus servo, and make the disc rotate, Further
experimentation confirmed that the internal controls were more or less in
their correct positions - tracking offset could make the pickup slew from one
end to the other, for example.

All this was leading nowhere until I accidentally happened to engage all
servos in the middle of a CD - and the track display suddenly appeared. I
reached for my headphones and confirmed that the CD was playing, just fine.

A little further investigation allowed me to determine that the CD would play
fine from about the middle to the end but would get progressively noisier
when moving toward the starting track and would be totally unplayable at the
very start.

Now, what could depend so fundamentally on track position? Well, there are
two possibilities: spindle motor speed and PLL frequency. A little careful
tweaking of PLL center frequency had little effect.

One thing I noticed was that one of the servo driver ICs was running quite
hot. This should have raised a red flag but again, this was the first time I
had seen this problem. I also observed that putting a heatsink on the IC and
blowing on this would permit the disc to play error free much closer to its
start.

So now, you are saying, "what a moron, everyone knows that Pioneer CD spindle
motors are crap". The confusing thing here was that the spindle motor was not
dead, just marginal. So, all basic observations came up negative.

Anyway, back to the saga. Suspecting the driver IC, I obtained a replacement
from MCM Electronics and swapped it. No change. Measuring motor voltage
showed a maximum of 1.7 V or so at any time including startup. Since the
driver is known now to be good and power was confirmed to be stable, I
started to suspect the motor.

Disconnecting the spindle motor and cycling the player revealed that the
driver was putting almost 10 V on the motor terminals but the motor was no
doubt partially shorted and dropping this to less than 2 V with the
consequential high power dissipation in the driver.

Now for the long shot. While the player was attempting to spin up and read
the disc directory, I gave the motor a squirt of degreaser through its
ventilation holes. The motor took off - went totally overspeed. Power off.
Wait for degreaser to evaporate. Try again. Now, the directory came up the
first time even though my internal controls were still no doubt not perfectly
tweaked. All functions worked perfectly. For the first time is about 2 years,
the player was producing music (without the help of TEST mode!

I then performed a normal alignment of the internal controls (but this is
another story).

Measuring the motor voltage now showed greater than 5 V at spinup and a range
of 2-.5 V between start and end of disc.

Comment: At this point the proper course of action would be to replace the
spindle motor. However, since this is my CD player and replacing spindle
motors is sometimes a pain, I will just keep an eye on performance. A pretty
good indication of the motor's state is the time to spinup. If this
deteriorates again I will be forced to replace the motor. For now, it
continues to be satisfactory.

The initial confusion here was due to the fact that the motor was not totally
dead, just weak enough to cause a problem with the inner tracks and more
importantly, the directory. This is one of those cases where the old style
turntable with a bad weak motor would have been much easier to troubleshoot,

@node 13 "Chapter 13) Dead Power One 400 W Multiple Output Switcher"

Patient
     Power One multiple output 400 W switching power supply.

Symptomsu
     Totally dead. No schematics available.

Testing
     Applying power produces no output. Only observation is that lights
     flicker indicating the input filter capacitors are charging so this
     eliminates a blown line fuse as a possibility.

Unfortunately, this unit is not what I would call a 'simple switcher'. In
addition to the main switchmode transistor, there are 2 other power
transistors, a uA723 IC regulator, countless discrete transistors, resistors,
capacitors, some components I cannot identify. This is all on the primary
side of the transformer. Tracing the circuit is virtually out of the question
due to its complexity. The only good news is that I have several identical
units so I can compare readings between the bad one and a working unit.
Powering with a Variac produces similar lack of any output. This is not a
case of the outputs shutting down - there is simply no startup.

First check: power to main filter caps, continuity of thermal protector,
power to uA723, power to switchmode power transistor. These all are fine.

Next, checked components around input including power transistors, large
resistors (suspecting a startup problem), capacitors, etc. All ok.

Finally, about to give up, I decide to just test resistance across a more or
less random selection of components. Everything is identical until I put my
meter across a 6.8 M ohm resistor. On the good unit, this measures above 1 M
ohm. On the bad unit, it measures about 40 K ohms. I unsolder components
around this resistor until I located a 2N4124 transistor that makes a
difference when removed. Testing on the x1 range of my VOM it tests fine but
on the x1K scale, there is significant leakage in the reverse biased
junctions. Comparing with a nearby 2N4124, this is definitely not the normal
characteristics of a 2N4124. The 2N4124 is a general purpose transistor so I
replaced it with a handy 2N3904.

Powering with a Variac, the supply now comes up fine. I have no idea of the
function of the bad transistor.

Comment: This might be called a blind repair. Like bad connections, the
failure mechanism and function of the bad part will probably never be known.
It is not known whether the transistor was marginal to begin with and its
characteristics just drifted over time, or whether it went bad.

The basic assumptions which permit this technique to work at all are that for
a sudden change in behavior in a system with mostly discrete parts, one of
these parts has changed its resistance enough that an ohmmeter check has a
chance to find it and that the circuitry is interconnected enough that
checking a relatively small subset of node combinations has a good chance of
locating the bad part.

@node 14 "Chapter 14) Goldstar CR820U TV with no Color"

Patient
     Goldstar model CR820U 19" color TV. Paid $1 at garage sale. If I can
     repair it cheaply, it will be given to someone in need free or for a
     nominal charge.

Symptoms
     Basically operational except absolutely no color - not even any color
     noise between channels. Color and Tint knobs have no effect. In
     addition, brightness control has very limited range - brightness
     slightly too high. Several other minor problems including cracked tuner
     knob, dirty tuner, broken antenna wires.

Testing
     This involved tuning local strong channels, adjusting fine tuning,
     tweaking AGC, etc. Under no circumstances was there any hint of color in
     the picture or between channels.

Fortunately, such symptoms narrow down the possible area of investigation to
the chroma decoder circuitry. Searching the circuit board for a likely
subsystem, I found that the set uses a TA7608P chroma chip. Fortunately, this
chip is listed in my ECG Semiconductor Master Replacement Guide with a cross
to ECG1532. Naturally, I suspect the IC at this point but know better than to
just go out and find a replacement - I have been burned in this way with an
RCA TV color problem - maybe I will say more on that in another Repair Brief.
While the ECG does have a pinout, this does not really provide enough
information to probe the circuit.

Off to the library to obtain the SAM's Photofact for this set. $0.75 poorer,
I copied the complete schematic and another interesting page - a chart
showing the resistances to ground for all pins on all of the intergrated
circuits used in the TV. One item I forgot to look for was the block diagram
that may have been included of the TA7608P chip. Oh well.

One thing I did try once armed with the SAM's was to attempt to tweak the
subbrightness control. Even this had very little effect. OK, on to the fun
stuff.

First test: confirm that the resistances of the circuit match those printed
on the resistance chart. The chart specifies a DMM that applies less than .1
V on the ohms scales (to prevent forward biasing of any semiconductor
junctions). Hopefully, my DMM satisfies this requirement. First step: make
sure the main filter capacitor is discharged before making any resistance
measurements. Done. Unfortunately. these tests do not reveal anything amiss.

Tests of this type are not guaranteed to find any problems. However, there is
a fair chance that a shorted or open part would show up as a bad reading in
the near that part. In my case, if there were any bad parts, the circuit
topology prevented this simple resistance test from detecting them.

Now for the live tests. I don't have a color bar generator so I just have to
hope that a broadcast channel will provide a signal that is close enough.

In the interest of safety, all the following tests are made with the set
powered off of my isolation transformer.

Voltage measurements were inconclusive. Although some where off by 20%, this
could be due to my non standard input signal. There did not appear to be any
particular pattern.

Next, I used a scope to look at the testpoints for which SAM's supplied
waveforms. Again, these will be different than the ones using a standard
colorbar signal but the overall appearance should enable me to determine if a
particular output is dead or the amplitude is way off.

All the waveforms looked reasonable except one - the output of what I deduce
to be a gated chroma amplifier. Its output is almost dead. The color
reference oscillator (3.58... MHz) looks fine as do the chroma input and
color burst gating pulses. All the supply voltages and decoupling pins look
fine as well. This doesn't look good for the chip. The signal seems to be
getting in but the chroma amp would seem to be dead. Fortunately, I could not
locate an inexpensive replacement from my usual sources. The TA7608P is
probably obsolete. Even the ECG1532 is not available from MCM Electronics or
Dalbani. I did not get to the point of trying ECG directly. You will see why
I say 'fortunately' in a moment.

When confronted with a situation of this type, I usually try some
experiments.

What would happen if I apply the chroma signal directly to the point in the
circuit that is the output of that dead chroma amp? I take a 10K resistor and
jump the input of the chip to the chroma amp output (and input to the chroma
demodulator.) Now, I have colored stripes on the screen indicating that the
chroma demodulator circuit is probably functioning. (Without the color burst
to phase lock, I could not hope for anything more). So, it still looks like
that bad amplifier. Well, one last desperate effort....

I use my sam's patented magic spit. This has served in on numerous occasions
mostly when locating clock noise, marginal timing, or glitches in high speed
digital systems but hey, the world is really analog anyhow. I am not joking.
Those who have done serious debugging know exactly what I am talking about.
Moisten your finger. Run it up and down the pins on a suspect device. If
something changes you have either (1) found a particularly critical or high
impedance but normally behaving circuit (for example the frequency
determining LC network of an oscillator) or (2) something that is open or on
the edge.

Magic spit to the rescue: running my finger (one hand in my pocket, isolation
transformer, etc.) over the two rows of pins on the chroma chip proved to
yield immediate results. Around the low number pins, the color suddenly
appeared grossly overloaded but with some indication of correlation with the
picture. This is the first time I have seen any indication of picture related
color. Hum.... OK, now to narrow it down. I take an insulated wire, and strip
both ends. Holding one bare end with my fingers, I touch each of the pins in
turn of the chip. Touching pin 6 has the most dramatic effect producing the
distorted colors. What is connected to pin 6? According to the schematic, it
is a 2.2 M ohm resistor to pin 3 and a decoupling capacitor to the power
supply. It is unlikely that the capacitor would fail in such a way as to
cause this behavior. So it must be the resistor. Rummaging around in my
resistor cabinet I come up with a 2.2 M ohm resistor. and tack it across pins
3 and 6 (with power off!).

Now I get distorted color but this looks a lot more like a color TV than what
I had before. Time for a better antenna. That helped a little but the picture
is way too dark. Well, I did fiddle with the sub-brightness control back when
it had minimal effect. Locating the sub-brightness control again, it now
functions as expected having more than a sufficient range. When adjusted to
produce a picture of normal brightness (with the user control mid-range), the
color appears normal. Some additional fiddling with the Color and Tint
controls yields a fine looking color picture.

Removing and testing the original 2.2 M ohm resistor confirms an open
circuit.  Soldering in my replacement completes the repair.

Now to clean the tuner, wipe down the case, repair the knob and antenna....

Total cost $1.77 including original purchase price (I threw in a hypothetical
$.02 for the resistor).

As I am writing this, I am watching the Goldstar TV - my trusty RCA has just
died after 14 years with no picture (raster and sound ok - that will be
another Repair Brief).

Comments: It is always tempting to suspect the expensive or unavailable part
first. Very often, as in this case, this proves to be erroneous. Had the
TA7608P been readily available at reasonable cost, I would have probably
replaced it only to find no change in behavior. This would, however, have
saved time.

Be warned that the 'sam's magic spit' approach must be used with caution. You
must understand the safety implications of touching *any* live circuit
especially with moistened fingers. I use an isolation transformer for
debugging. However, even with this precaution, I would think twice before
doing this on a live chassis (the Goldstar signal circuits are isolated from
the power line).

@node 15 "Chapter 15) Panasonic PV3720 VCR with Erratic Horizontal Video Noise"

Patient
     Panasonic PV3720 3 head VCR.

Symptoms
     Band of what looked like tracking noise would come and go depending on
     tape being played, speed of tape, whether at start or end, etc. The
     noise was confined to the top 1/3 of the picture. Its height could vary
     from just a couple of video lines to a band occupying 20 % of the
     screen.

Testing
     Several tapes were played initially. Problem would be nearly absent with
     some but severe on others. It was generally worse with EP recorded tapes
     compared to SP tapes.

I generally do not like problems of this type because one of the more likely
possibilities is of a worn video head. This is one of the classic symptoms
yet it could have a number of other causes. The approach must be to eliminate
as best as possible the alternative causes until the risk of purchasing a new
video is minimized.

Alternate #1: dirty heads. Head cleaning with a wet cleaning tape followed by
a manual cleaning had little effect.

Alternate #2: tape path alignment. Visual inspection of the tape movement
showed nothing out of the ordinary. Tape motion was very smooth and uniform
with no wiggling, wavering, or wondering. All tape guides were properly
positioned, perfectly vertical (where appropriate) and the tape appeared to
be riding at the correct height on the video head cylinder.

Alternate #3: backtension. Insufficient backtension could result in similar
problems. Inspection seemed to indicate that backtension was normal. Manually
increasing backtension by gently pressing the backtension level to the left
made a slight improvement. Increasing the spring tension did the same.
However, these were not dramatic effects and backtension is not a critical
setting to obtain a clean picture (though it is important to be accurate to
minimize head wear and clogging).

Alternate #4: roller guide height. Although visual inspection of the of the
tape path alignment proved negative I decided to confirm roller guide height
by careful adjustment of the supply side roller guide - carefully noting its
original position. (Problems at the top of the picture would be related to
the supply side roller guide.) Optimal position for both EP and SP was at the
original setting.

This left the video head as a likely candidate and at this point based on the
age of the machine, a new video head cylinder (MCM Electronics, ERH433) was
ordered and installed. Success! There was no doubt about the improvement. The
noise bards completely disappeared and the normal backtension provided more
then adequate head-tape contact.

Comments: Subtle problems that eventually point to the video heads are among
the more difficult to diagnose with enough confidence to risk ordering an
expensive video head and find out that the problem was elsewhere. This was a
case of video head wear (as opposed to a mechanical or electronic failure of
the heads). The chance of having an identical video head available to swap -
which is the best test - is quite small, especially for a 3 head type. If
this were a 4 head machine, some meaningful comparisons could be made during
playback since a different set of heads is often used depending on tape speed
and mode.

Thus, unless there is visible damage to the video heads or something like an
open winding that could be revealed by simple testing, it comes down to
eliminating as best as possible the alternatives until only the head remains
a likely possibility.

@node 16 "Chapter 16) Panasonic Color TV Shakes and Pulsates"

Patient
     Late model Panasonic 17" color TV

Symptoms
     Width slightly reduced. Slight evidence of 60 Hz hum bar, brightness
     pulsating, raster shaking, somewhat channel dependent.

Testing
     All of these symptoms were easily reproduced on the bench. The 60 Hz hum
     bar is the giveaway indicating a low voltage power supply problem.

Rather than operating the TV off a Variac to confirm lack of regulation, I
decide to just try the most likely solution - a replacement main filter
capacitor. With power off and making sure the main filter capacitor is
discharged, I use a pair of clip leads to jumper my test cap across its
terminals.

The set now works perfectly.

Removing the old capacitor (not easy as the rivlets really do make nice heat
sinks), testing with my trusty Radio Shack DMM on its capacitance scale
reveals that the value has dropped by over 85% - pretty amazing that the set
worked at all!

One highly overpriced replacement filter capacitor (I used a local
distributor instead of my favorite mail order sources) and the deed is done.

No disasters on this one!

Comments: This capacitor was mounted next to a large heat sink - possibly the
power regulator. When replacing electrolytics, we often ignore one very
important specification - the temperature rating. Either the original
capacitor was defective or it was not rated for the thermal conditions inside
a compact TV. The TV was not that old - maybe 3 or 4 years at most. We all
can point to equipment we own that is still working after 20 or 30 years
going strong on the original filter capacitors.

@node 17 "Chapter 17) Original ATT Touch Tone Phone will not Dial"

Patient
     Classic ATT Touch Tone Wall Phone. 'Battlewagon' usually considered
     indestructible.

Symptoms
     Everything worked fine except dialing. For some buttons, dial tone would
     not go away. For others, tones would be accepted but would be erratic
     and incorrect digits. Certain tones sounded weak or single frequency.

Testing
     All buttons were tested. It was found that the problem was not even
     consistent as some buttons would not work all the time.

While the internal wiring of one of these old phones is intimidating, the
basic tone dialing circuitry is an amazing example of simplicity. About the
only things that fail yet still permit some tone generation are the pot core
coils that determine tone frequency. Therefore, this is the first thing to
check.

Sure enough, the core that deals with rows has split where the two halfs are
joined. This seems to be a common problem due to both the age and brittle
cement used on some revs of this model phone, and probably, as a result of
rough treatment when hanging up the handset.

These cores must be aligned before being glued back together. In addition,
there is an adjustment plug which may need to be tweaked. I align by ear as
follows: Put a known good tone dialing phone and the bad phone on the same
phone line. Depending on which core is bad, depress either an entire (same)
row or column of buttons on both phones. (Adhesive tape is handy to hold down
the buttons unless you have four hands.) By depressing the entire set of
buttons, you are disabling the other tone generator so you hear a pure tone.
Without turning the fine adjustment plug (assuming it was not disturbed; if
it was, set it mid-range or the same as the one in the other core), rotate
the loose core top until a zero beat is obtained. As your rotate the core,
you will hear the tone change. As it approaches the correct setting, you will
hear the tones beat against each other. When you are set correctly, the
pitches will be equal and the beat frequency will go to zero. Mark the
position of the core with a pen or pencil and then glue with Epoxy or other
general purpose adhesive (around the outside - not on the mating surfaces as
this will affect the tone frequencies). After the glue sets, confirm and
adjust the plug core if needed. These cores use a strange triangular core
tool - I made mine by filing down an aluminum roofing nail (do not use a
ferrous material).

Comments: Those classic ATT touch tone phones are virtually indestructible.
However, broken cores (or actually, just broken joints on the cores) are
common but easily repaired once you know what to look for. Setting the tones
by referencing a known good phone seems to be a very reliable technique as
the zero beat permits an adjustment to better than .1%. Note that if the
reference phone is a more modern (and flimsy digital one), then pushing
multiple buttons may not work as it does with the old analog models. Setting
the frequency using the normal dual tones will work - it is just not as
easy..

@node 18 "Chapter 18) Pioneer PD5100 CD Player Trashed"

Patient
     Pioneer PD5100 single disc CD player in really sad shape. Garage sale
     acquisition paid $2. Probably paid too much. This episode is more aptly
     called a restoration rather than a repair. Perhaps a feature length
     saga. The challenge was irresistible.

Symptoms
     Tray wasn't even on track, just sitting inside; Flapper ripped off of
     mountings, electronic condition unknown. It is obvious that the owner
     had attempted something - it would be generous to call it a repair - and
     was unable or did not bother to get it back together.

Testing
     Not applicable at this point. With loose parts removed, power was
     applied to determine if there was any hope at all. At least the front
     panel came alive and pressing Eject resulted in the tray loading motor
     spinning.

In order to attempt to play a disc, the controller needs to think that the
tray is closed. It will then go through its startup cycle. In the case of
this player, there is a limit switch - somewhere. Rather than trying to
locate it, I decide to put the tray back on its tracks. This is easy but
there is still something wrong as it jams when the Eject button is pressed.
So be it, leave that for later. At least the limit switch will be activated.
Rummaging around in the pile of lonely parts removed from the carcass, I
locate the clamper cover with the magnet. I pop in a garbage CD, put the
clamper cover on top (make a mental not to press Eject under any
circumstances as the tray, disc, cover, and anything else that is not screwed
down would probably fly across the room) and press the power button. Some
success - the disc spins and the directory is correctly displayed. The
display came up rather quickly indicating that most of the optics and servos
cannot be far out of alignment. This is quite remarkable!

With mounting anticipation, I connect the audio outputs to my amplifier and
press play. The disc spins and makes repeated attempts to start playing at
track 1 but it is obvious that something is terribly wrong. Attempting to
play other tracks results in similar behavior.

The pickup appears to actually move to the general vicinity of the correct
track but is unable to locate and lock onto the time/track that is selected.
Pioneer CD players perform a very audible search to home in on the correct
disc location; there was no evidence of this search.

I next attempt careful adjustment of the servo controls. Note that I do not
expect this to help the problem based on how quickly the directory was
displayed. However, the tracking could still be off and with care, there
should be little risk of making things worse. Who knows what controls the
owner touched in a misguided hope of performing a miracle. First, I marked
the *exact* position of each control with a felt tip pen. This will get me
back to the supposedly good positions no matter what. The only controls that
would likely have an effect are those related to tracking. Careful tweaking
of tracking balance, tracking offset, and tracking gain have no detectable
effect. I put them back in their original position and verify that the player
still recognizes the disc. So far so good?

At least the moron who butchered this thing does not seem to have touched the
electronic adjustments.

At this point what do we know? Well, we know that all of the major components
of the optical deck work including the laser, photodiode array, fine focus
and tracking voice coil actuators, and spindle motor. These are all needed to
read the disc index. The spindle motor, a common problem in Pioneer CD
players is fine as its toughest task is at disc startup where the speed is
greatest. Since the disc index is located at the very inner extent of the
disc, we do not know if the sled servo (coarse tracking) is working
correctly, only that it is doing something - it resets to the inner track if
manually moved away and it does move to the approximate position of the
selected track.

Well, Pioneer CDs have a TEST mode. Where is the button? I hunt all over for
the little button and am about to give up when there it is! Hidden by the
cables to the front panel.

OK, press TEST while switching on power. Now I have control of the servos. A
little experimentation confirms that focus and spindle rotation seem to be
functional: (of course, we knew that, right?) With no disc in place, the
focus search routine is initiated by pressing TRACK FWD. The disc will only
spin if focus lock is achieved and this is confirmed with a disc in place. So
far nothing new. I am able to move the pickup back and forth on its tracks by
pressing SEARCH FWD and REV.

However, when entering the correct sequence to play at an arbitrary point on
the disc, weird things happen. If I use the SEARCH FWD and REV buttons to
move the pickup to a particular spot on the disc, press TRACK FWD to close
the focus servo, PLAY to start spindle rotation, and then PAUSE to actually
start playing, the track and time info is only displayed for an instant.
Then, the pickup seems to move toward and bump against the inner limit.
Sometimes, a couple of times are displayed in rapid succession which are not
sequential as they should be. In fact, they nearly always are far apart and
the second is usually a lower time than the first. Then the display is blank.

Hum, I don't have a schematic so this could be the end of the line. But, I do
see one chip on the circuit board that is getting unusually hot and I know
from past experience that it is a servo driver - TA8410K. I have absolutely
no idea if it is related in any way to the problem or really, for that
matter, what the problem is. I only know that (1) it has only 10 pins and is
easy to replace, (2) I have a replacement in my parts box, and (3) it is
getting hot (which may or may not be a fault since I know these type of chips
to run at least warm).

Getting to the bottom of the circuit board proves to be a bit harder than
anticipated requiring removal of most of the snap type connectors. I guess
these are cheaper than real connectors for Pioneer but a pain for servicing
(cables are terminated in tinned wires and placed in the connector housing,
then a cover is pressed down to lock them in place). I manage to only mangle
one of these (cosmetic damage only).

Replacement goes smoothly. Getting all the connectors back in place is loads
of fun but the effort is worthwhile! Now, the disc plays on the first
attempt.  There are still some tracking problems but this is a distinct
improvement. In all honesty, I am not sure that the chip made the difference
- it could have been a bad connections at one of the connectors. The new chip
runs warm, perhaps not quite as hot as the old one, I am really not positive.
I put a heatsink on it in any case (as I always do with these chips - just
for insurance.

Next I tackle the mechanical restoration. First step: get the tray to move
smoothly. Without going into terrible detail, the tray consists of two parts
whose relative motion raises and lowers the disc. There appears to be
something missing which controls when this raising and lowering takes place
as the disc is lowered even before the tray moves into the machine. Sometimes
there is a ball that controls this and a little examination reveals a grease
trail where such a ball could have been. A corresponding hole in the tray
bottom confirms this. I didn't notice any such ball in the parts pile but it
could have easily been lost (I later found it near a corner of my workbench)
but for now, I located a similar sized steel ball in my steel ball
collection.  With the ball in place, the tray now moves smoothly in and out
and the disc is raised and lowered at the proper time.

Now for the clamper.

This is a much sorrier affair as the clamper is mounted to the deck
sheetmetal with a couple of plastic standoffs that have been totally snapped
off at their bases. First I try simply glueing them but this does not appear
to be solid enough. In addition to the glue, I am able to clamp one down with
a metal scrap that I carefully shape and screw down. For the other, I made a
splint using a screw through a drilled hole into a neighboring strut. Now the
clamper moves up and down at the proper time but the cover disk with the
magnet seems to hit the tray. The part that seems to help out has totally
disappeared so I take a brass rod and mount it in its place. Even without the
rest of the mechanism, this seems to work fine. This rod, wrapped with
electrical tape to prevent damage to the disc, prevents the disc from
flopping around too much. Disc loads; disc unloads; all is well.

I then went through the electrical servo adjustment procedure as outlined in
the CD Player Notes, final tweaking by maximizing the amplitude and stability
of the 'eye' pattern. I made the mistake of attempting to touch the
'tangential adjustment' (at least that is what I think it is - without a
proper alignment disc, this appears to be very difficult) and spent some
frantic minutes until I was able to restore it to its original position.
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony comes in handy as it runs almost to the edge of
the disc (74 minutes) necessary to access the tangential adjustment. I even
risked careful adjustments of the LD - laser power just to determine that it
was not at the limit of its power. It was not. I am fairly confident at this
point that the adjustments are pretty much where they should be - and they
are very close to their original position.

Now the CD player works fairly well though it does not seem to have as much
disc defect tolerance as I would expect. I do not know if there is still a
fault either optical, mechanical, or electronic as all tests that I can
perform without service info seem satisfactory. Considering what the player
went through, this has still been a rewarding experience.

Comments: I consider this to be more of a learning experience than a repair.
At the outset, I did not expect to be able to get nearly as far as I did. It
was fun as such things go.

While I am in favor of home repairs, this is an example of a situation where
whoever attempted the repair of a problem due most likely to the bad servo
driver IC, totally destroyed any possibility of a professional even going
beyond looking at the unit and stating: "Yup, that was a CD player once upon
a time long long ago. To whom should I send the flowers?"

@node 19 "Chapter 19) Yamaha R8 Receiver with AM/FM Tuning Problems"

Patient
     Yamaha R8 stereo receiver, about 4 years old at the time of the failure.

Symptoms
     Fm reception is totally dead. Station numbers change erratically, not
     possible to save presets. Some AM stations work but most do not. This
     happened without warning - turned it on one day and it was sick.

Testing
     This involved methodically checking to see what functions are
     operational. Incrementing and decrementing of FM station frequencies is
     not operational in seek mode, only in manual. There is not reception on
     any FM station frequencies. Incrementing or decrementing AM station
     numbers across certain boundaries (I forget the exact locations) causes
     a sudden jump of 800 KHz and may actually jump to an illegal station
     frequency. Various other modes are non functional including saving of
     memory presets. Even the hard reset does not store the factory presets.

I purchased the service manual for this unit - a nice piece of documentation
and very reasonable - about $12. However, this is an example of modern
technology where even schematics, pin descriptions of the various LSI chips,
parts lists, etc. are not really adequate when so much depends on firmware
(in 3 microcontrollers) which is not provided. It turned out to be difficult
to even determine where each function is centered.

Some electrical tests that were performed:

Power supply voltages were verified.

Waveforms were checked on frequency synthesizer chip (LC7210).

Function of PLL charge pump was verified in both AM and FM. Output (VCO
control voltage) was consistent with frequency display when reception was
possible but not at other times. However, this could not be a problem with
the charge pump, only the digital control.

Intermediate 4 bit busses were checked for stuck-at faults - there were none.

The first real clue is that since even some manual tuning functions are
faulty, this is probably a digital fault. Presumably in manual, the station
display is driven by the microcontroller that drives the synthesizer chip
rather than being returned by that chip after a station search. Even in this
mode (for AM), there is the issue of the 800 KHz jump. This is not
approximate but exact and probably due to a stuck bit representing the 800
place value. The question then became: where was the bad bit? It is not on
one of the intermediate busses as these were tested.

Could it be in the tuning microcontroller? Maybe, but then I would expect
other functions controlled by this chip to be faulty (like mode setting,
etc.)  This is not the case. Could it be in the frequency synthesizer chip?
Probably as only station tuning functions are defective. Could it be
elsewhere? There do not appear to be any other busses or digital control
lines that could cause the set of problems that are present.

However, not confident enough of the diagnosis of the faulty LC7210
synthesizer to spend the $25 or so that Yamaha would probably charge and not
finding this part in any of my normal mail order sources, I set the receiver
aside for a while. I dig out my garage sale NAD for use in the meantime.

A couple of MCM catalog editions later - what's this? LC7210 - $6. I will
spring for that. Next MCM order arrives, solder in a socket as I always do
where possible. Replacement chip cures all problems!

With 20/20 hindsight, it is almost possible to identify the place inside the
LC7210 where the 800s bit bus fault occurs based on the symptoms and the
rudimentary block diagram provided in the service manual.

Comments: Although not evident from the description above, this was a
frustrating experience even with the service manual because there really was
not enough information present to make the logical inferences needed to come
to a definitive conclusion as to the defective part. Modern consumer
electronics include more and more microcontrollers where the intelligence is
buried in firmware and not the hardware itself. Without firmware listings, a
microprocessor is just a black box even with pins listings and internal block
diagrams. It would be nice if the service manual would at least provide
better indications of which functions is located where - identifying the
functions of each of the components. (It would also be nice if they were
written or at least edited by Americans (in the case of a manual destined for
the U.S. market). Some of the translations are, well, a bit strange.

@node 20 "Chapter 20) Sylvania TV with no Horizontal Sync"

Patient
     Sylvania Color Television, about 20 years old.

Symptoms
     Suddenly, the picture lost *all* horizontal hold. There was no evidence
     of any kind of attempt at lock in. I do not know whether this happened
     at power-on or while in use.

Testing
     With strong signal, it was determined that horizontal hold had no
     effect. It is as though the H sync is not making it to the lock
     circuitry. Adjusting horizontal hold makes picture move across screen.
     Angle of sides of picture changes but there is no lock - even incorrect
     - at any setting.

Using my isolation transformer, I prepare to scope the relevant signals. I
obtain the SAM's for the set. I check for the sync signal at the input to
IC400 (I think). It is there. This should be a snap - bad IC! Well, that is
exactly what happens - a careless slip of the scope probe and not only a
snap, but a crackle and a pop - and now I have no video, no HV, no deflection
- nothing.

OK, so what started out as a simple signal problem is now a major (at least
cost and pride wise) power supply problem.

Checking the first TO3 transistor I can locate - short - one dead transistor.
This is the power supply series chopper.

Checking the horizontal output transistor (HOT) with an ohmmeter - short -
second dead transistor.

After removing transistor, I check for rectified line voltage at the input to
the chopper - nothing. Tracing this back I soon locate an open fusable
resistor.

So, whatever I touched probably caused the HOT to fail (forced on for too
great a time can blow the HOT as a single shot event). The shorted HOT
probably then took out the chopper transistor.

This is not fun. It is not likely to be inexpensive either. It does seem that
no other parts have been sacrificed. Fusable resistors and driver transistors
seem ok in so far as my meter is concerned. I still assume that the original
problem was caused by a faulty IC400 but this point it is impossible to
confirm this since the set id dead-dead.

Damage:

Chopper transistor - $10, horizontal output transistor - $6. IC400 - $15,
fusable resistor - $1.

After replacing the components, making sure to use mica insulators and
silicone heat sink compound for the transistors, the set comes back alive.
Sync is fine. A little touchup of the video background and gain controls
(unrelated to the sync problem) and we are done. Ouch.

Comments: The lessons learned here came at a cost - but mostly to my pride.
Cascade failures are all too easy to induce through carelessness. Power
supply circuits are not forgiving. One would think that probing the sync
signal would not be able to kill anything. However, the design of power
supply and deflection systems share some common characteristics. One of these
is that a single instance of an improper drive waveform can blow the
switching transistor as a single shot event - excessive current or excessive
flyback voltage. This is a matter of exceeding the safe operating area of the
transistor.

What you learn: if possible, make all connections to your test equipment with
power off. Insulate all but the last mm of your probe so that any slip cannot
cause a short. Work methodically, think things through, don't be over-eager,
don't take shortcuts.

@node 21 "Chapter 21) Dead Microwave Oven"

Patient
     Microwave oven (don't recall the brand).

Symptoms
     Totally dead - no front panel display or anything else.

Testing
     Plugged unit into live outlet confirms description of problem.

First step: remove cover.

Second step: confirm that HV capacitor is discharged. Although the unit has
been unplugged for several days, it never hurts to be careful. Discharge with
high value high wattage resistor (well insulated) and confirm with HV
voltmeter.

Read or maybe get [shocked] and maybe even [die] :

Notes on Safety V1.00 (7KB)

WARNING WARNING WARNING etc. Microwave ovens are probably the most dangerous
piece of consumer electronic equipment in terms of potential for
electrocution while being repaired. Much more so than TVs, for example.

   o There is up to 5,000 V negative with respect to the chassis while
     powered and stored in the capacitor when shut down. The energy stored in
     this capacitor is roughly ten times that stored in the CRT second anode
     of a TV or monitor. A malfunctioning oven that does not blow a fuse is
     potentially even more of a hazard since the capacitor cannot discharge
     into the magnetron load after shutdown.

   o The available current exceeds 1 A. Depending on the transformer, this
     may flow until the fuse blows or circuit breaker trips.

   o An isolation transformer (assuming you had one large enough) or GFCI
     will not protect against HV shock since the HV is already on the
     secondary side of the HV transformer and, as noted, the HV return is the
     chassis.

   o A circuit breaker or fuse is not sensitive enough and too slow to
     provide any protection for you.

You might think at first that the possibility of microwave exposure is the
principal danger. However, unless the door seal, oven chamber, or waveguide
or its seals are damaged, there is no way for microwave radiation to escape.
This still means that proper precautions should be taken - don't operate the
oven for longer than needed with the cover off and don't stand too close.

Third step: test fuse. Open. Since these have ceramic bodies, it is not easy
to determine if the fuse died due to an overload or a short by visual
examination.

A microwave oven can blow a fuse for several possible reasons. Some of these
are:

  1. Shorted Magnetron.

  2. Shorted capacitor.

  3. Shorted rectifier.

  4. Defective door interlock switches.

  5. Bad Triac (possibly causes transformer core saturation due to operating
     as half wave rectifier or SCR).

  6. Bad transformer (shorted turns cause overload).

Fortunately, all but the last two are generally easy to identify using just
an ohmmeter. Sometimes, an intermittent or short that occurs only at full
voltage will prove elusive, however.

Some quick checks reveal that the capacitor is a dead short.

When replacing a microwave oven capacitor, it is important to get a fairly
close match for the capacitance. The uF rating of the capacitor affects the
microwave power output. Note that the 'working volts' rating on a microwave
oven capacitor is not the same as on common capacitors found in other
electronic equipment. It is not the maximum voltage permitted across the
capacitor but closer to the VRMS rating of the HV transformer. And of course,
before you start pulling wires off (1) mark down where they go and (2)
discharge/check for voltage on the cap one more time.

Replacing the capacitor with one from MCM Electronics brings the oven back to
life.

Comments: It is highly likely that the capacitor failed due to a defect in
manufacture rather than some other underlying problem in the circuitry. When
one thinks about how a capacitor is constructed - rolled up layers of foil
and dielectric - it is amazing that capacitors do not fail that often. Any
nick, thin spot, etc. represents a point of excess stress and can fail as in
this case after considerable use - resulting in a short circuit, dead oven,
and unhappy chef.

@node 22 "Chapter 22) Tandy Color TV/Monitor with hum bars"

Patient
     Tandy color TV/monitor found curbside. Unit appears to be in good
     physical condition. Remote is missing. Well, you cannot have everything.

Symptoms
     When first turned on, TV appears to function normally. Why was it
     tossed? Well, after 30 seconds or so, a pair of hum bars begins to
     appear in the picture gradually getting worse until horizontal width and
     sync are affected.

Testing
     Using a Variac, there is a point below normal line voltage where set
     operates perfectly. OK, so I will keep a Variac attached to the unit!

After removing the cover, the first thing to suspect is the main filter
capacitor. If this should dry up and lose some of its value, these would be
the exact symptoms. Jumpering (with power off) of a known good capacitor I
keep for this purpose doesn't change anything. But what is this? A discolored
resistor catches my eye. Maybe it is changing value as it heats and causing
these symptoms. I wait a reasonable time for the set to cool and measure the
resistor - 360 ohms. OK, replace with new one. Expecting this to cure the
problem I am disappointed when there is absolutely no change.

Off to the library for the SAMs Photofact. Darn - SAMs does not have a
service folder for this model. Nor for any similar models that I can
determine (the librarian was very cooperative).

Well, the problem seems to be heat related. I get out my trusty can of cold
spray. After going through nearly the entier can, it would seem that there is
only one part that has an effect on the hum bars when it is chilled. It is
the SCR that is part of the power supply regulator. Rather than simply
obtaining a replacement, I decide to trace the circuit to determine, if
possible, the possible cause of the problem figuring at this point that the
SCR is simply sensitive to heat.

During normal operation, an IC drives the gate of the SCR but what is this??
Until the secondary supplies kick in and provide power to the IC, the SCR is
driven by - you guessed it - the mysterious resistor. The other end of the
resistor goes to the raw DC on the main filter capacitor. Now that is
odd....Since I do not believe much in coincidences, I now start rethinking
the significance of this. Maybe that resistor is not quite what it appears to
be.

First, I remove it and see what happens: nothing. Power on, power off,
nothing.

Next, I momentarily touch the resistor to the circuit pad - the set comes
alive. Then I remove it. The set remains alive. And, after several minutes,
no hum bars. Hum....

I then try increasingly larger values of resistance until turn on is not
reliable - 15 K seems marginal, so I will go with 8.2 K ohms = that is over
25 times what I measured! No wonder there were hum bars indicating regulation
problems - that low value resistor was totally overwhelming the poor IC in
driving the SCR.

The set is used daily and has been operating without further problems for
over 5 years since reviving it. It works great with a $10 universal remote
control.

How did the resistor get damaged in the first place? I have no idea - maybe
its wattage was slightly underrated and it just finally decided to poop out.
I have no way of knowing what the original value was supposed to be or even,
for that matter, the wattage.

Comments: resistors can and do change value, sometimes, as in this case,
quite dramatically. Without a schematic, there is no easy way to determine
when and if this has happened - and what the original value should have been.
However, any discoloration, burn, or scorch marks should arouse suspicion.
With 20/20 hindsight, these signs may indicate the presence of carbon - a
fairly low resistance substance and thus reduced resistance is likely.

And yet again, a $.02 part renders a complex piece of equipment inoperative.

@node 23 "Chapter 23) Sony CDU33A 2X CD ROM Drive Failure"

Patient
     Sony CDU33A CDROM Drive given to me supposedly brand new but broken.

Symptoms
     Drive behaves the same as a similar working drive until it is accessed.
     Then, there is no response by any DOS or Windows software. No CDs are
     recognized, always get the message: Abort, Fail, Retry?

Testing
     I keep an old (well, what other type are there?) 286 PC clone system
     around for the primary purpose of testing peripherals. Installing the
     drive and software confirms the reported behavior. I was given two
     similar drives. The other one was reported as being intermittent but
     seems to work fine in my test system. This one was indeed dead.

Since it is impossible to observe the behavior of the pickup and, in
particular, the lens with the cover on, the first step is to get at the guts.

Fortunately, the CDU33A is quite simple to disassemble.

There are only two major components: the Printed Wiring Board (PWB) where all
the active electronics are located and the Optical Deck including laser,
optics, and pickup worm drive mechanism.

The other parts include the upper plastic casting and metal shroud, solenoid
latch assembly, right and left guide rails, drawer assembly, and front bezel,
two springs, bottom plate, 6 screws.

There are only two electrical connectors inside: one flat printed cable
linking the PWB and optical deck and a two pin connector supplying power to
the eject solenoid. This is in pleasant contrast to some other CDROM drives I
have seen with a half dozen or more small connectors spread all over the PWB
making removal and testing very difficult and risky.

After about 10 minutes, I have the drive apart and can now reassemble the
major components on the bench outside the case to observe behavior.

I prop up the circuit board and reconnect the flexible cable - noting the
orientation marks. I can now run the drive with full visibility of the
mechanism and optics. With a CD in place, there is no danger from the laser
beam. I make sure the PWB cannot short to anything and that the whole affair
cannot tip over.

Having set up this contraption (you would have to see it to appreciate
appreciate this terminology), I am ready to continue testing.

Naturally, it now works perfectly.

No amount of abuse seems to phase it - wiggling cables, flexing the circuit
board, trying multiple CDs, all fail to reproduce the original problems.
Could it be the case? I can think of no reason why it should make a
difference? Is there anything else different? I don't think so. Perhaps the
sled was jammed somehow and disassembling the drive fixed it. Who knows.

After reassembly, the drive continues to function perfectly.

Comments: How many times has someone brought you a 'broken' device which has
magically started working again on your bench. It certainly cannot hurt your
reputation. Admittedly, here, I had to actually do an exploratory before
rejuvenation to convince it that I meant business.

It has now been almost a year and the drive continues to function. I can only
guess that the cable may have been poorly seated or had some dirt stuck in
the contacts. Until it fails again, there isn't much more to try.
Unfortunately, the saying: "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" now applies. I
have no idea if the drive will ever again fail within its normal life
expectancy, but in the meantime, where did I put my Win95 CD? (No comments,
please, about choice of OS).

@node 24 "Chapter 24) Realistic Portable CD Player Randomly Shuts Off"

Patient
     Realistic portable CD player, about 4 years old.

Symptoms
     Player will shut off at totally random times or sometimes will not
     recognize the disc. There is a clicking associated with the problem -
     probably focus search failing.

Testing
     Attempting to play various CDs to completion provided no indication that
     the particular CD or power adapter made the slightest difference. There
     were some false leads with respect to the latter but these turned out to
     be strictly coincidence. The lens was inspected and cleaned anyhow with
     no change.

The first hint of the source of the fault came as a result of an observation
that pressing on the cover would sometimes either cause the player to stop in
the middle of a disc or allow it to recognize and begin playing a disc when
it would not otherwise cooperate.

Perhaps, the interlock switch was not being pressed in far enough. So, rather
than open the unit (I really don't like messing with the insides of portable
CDs if I can help it - you will see why in a few moments), I glued a bit of
plastic to the post that pokes the switch.

This seemed to help. For a few weeks, the problems had for the most part gone
away and the owner was a happy camper. Not surprisingly, this fix was only
temporary.

Since the quick fix had some effect, it is very likely that I am on the right
track. I will have to open it and deal with the switch face-to-face.

This is not too bad except that it is necessary to remove the main circuit
board to access the switch which is mounted on a little board of its own.
Four screws (large enough to actually see without a microscope) to get the
bottom off, another couple to remove the main board. One more and I can
remove or at least extend the switch circuit board far enough to inspect its
solder connections and get at the switch.

The solder doesn't look too bad but there might still be hairline cracks that
are not readily visible. A little reflow and they should be fine. (Problems
with solder joints here are not related to heat as in a TV or monitor but
rather due to the mechanical stress that is applied to the switch every time
the lid is closed.)

Now for the switch. It appears that the cover of the switch can be snapped
off relatively easily. The contacts appear somewhat gummy so I clean these
and pop the cover back on.

Tests with an ohmmeter now show the switch action to be solid. Wiggling the
switch lever and/or the entire switch has no effect.

Great, put it back together and I am done.

After replacing the switch board, main board, and bottom cover - the test.

Fanfare please!

Nothing. The player is dead as a door nail. It now will not even focus and
gives up almost immediately.

Off come the screws. Almost immediately, it is obvious what has happened. In
replacing the main board, I accidentally squashed one of the printed cables
linking the optical pickup and main board, partially severing the cable. In
fact, 2 of the 4 conductors are cut. This is the focus and tracking drive
cable so it is pretty important. What a pain!

Fortunately, luck is on my side with respect to the location of the break -
it is at a non-flexing part of the cable. Therefore, repairing the cable
should not be that difficult since once the conductors are connected
electrically, they can be coated with a sealer and flexing will not be a
problem.

To repair a cable of this type, I have two options: I can attempt to jumper
the break with some fine strands of wire or I can go point-to-point from the
circuit board to the destination on the optical pickup. However, the latter
connections are nearly hidden and would be difficult to solder.

I opt for the first. Using an Xacto knife, I carefully scrape the orange
mylar coating from both sides of the break. Then with #30 wire, I carefully
solder across the break for each of the conductors. A spring clothespin holds
the wire in place during the soldering. The entire affair is then coated with
some clear sealer to reinforce it mechanically and provide insulation. It
isn't pretty, but it will work fine. For added protection, I add a layer of
plastic electrical tape.

Now, finally, reassembling the unit keeping cable routing firmly in mind,
there should be no problem.

And, as expected, the player comes back to life and is rock solid with
respect to playing and recognizing discs. The oops should have no effect on
the expected longevity of the player.

Comments: we all can point to those minor disasters where we have overlooked
something where we should have been more careful. Whenever reassembling
anything, it is imperative that lead dress (ok, fancy term for how the cables
are routed) is kept firmly in the forefront of your mind. It seems that with
more and more miniaturization, this is an increasingly important and at
times, frustrating consideration. First of all, it is very tempting to say
when disassembling the unit 'this is obvious, no need to write it down'. Bad
move. Often, it appears much less obvious when putting everything back in its
place. I have never quite figured out how they do it during manufacturing -
correctly most of the time.

Ignoring cable routing can lead, as in this case, to severed wires. It can
also result in shorting between wires or between wires and sharp metal
brackets or shields. Broken wires can usually be repaired if they can be
located. Shorted signals can result in additional hard-to-locate collateral
damage which can really turn your hair gray.

What is even scarier is that with line connected electronics or appliances
like vacuum cleaners and even toasters - this can lead to electrically live
parts accessible to the user. Sometimes, the plastic insulation on typical
internal wiring will not fail immediately but will cold flow and cause
problems later. So, one should always make every effort to assure that no
wiring is being pinched and for metal cased appliances, check that the case
is not electrically live - has a high resistance (usually infinite, but at
least a few M ohms to both wires of the AC line with any on/off switches in
both positions) after the repair is completed. For non-heating appliances or
electronics, a little electrical tape goes a long way. For heating appliances
you really need to make sure that bare wires are routed far from any exposed
metal of the case taking into account as well any motion that may occur
during normal operation or due to being knocked about or dropped.

@node 25 "Chapter 25) Dead Zenith color TV"

Patient
     Zenith 19" color TV, about 5 years old. This TV is owned by a neighbor
     of mine who has small kids - more on this later.

Symptoms
     Dead as a door nail. Only evidence that it is connected to the line is a
     momentary flicker of lights when TV is turned on indicating that the
     main filter capacitor is being charged.

Testing
     This set has a pull-type on-off switch. There were no blown fuses.
     Checking with a voltmeter shows 150 V on the main filter capacitor with
     the switch in the on position. Ditto for the collector of the HOT.

This would seem to indicate that there is a problem with the startup drive to
the Horizontal Output Transistor (HOT).

Off to the library for the SAMs....

Many Zenith TVs use a simple multivibrator to generate a startup signal to
the horizontal driver transistor until the flyback can generate the secondary
voltages needed to operate the deflection ICs. Once these voltages are
present, the startup circuit is disabled. Indeed, such a design is used for
this TV.

Checking with a scope (powering the TV through my isolation transformer) at
the base of the HOT shows no drive signal.

Tracing back, there is no signal at the driver transistor or from the output
of the startup circuit. One of the two transistors in the startup
multivibrator is bad.

I do not have a suitable replacement - it is a high voltage low current
Zenith part similar to an MPSA43 - 200V. I will need to obtain one, or better
yet, two to replace both transistors in the multivibrator.

To confirm that the rest of the TV is operational, I use a common technique
to 'jump start' a TV where the startup circuit is defective. This is to
inject a signal of around 15-16 KHz directly into the base of the HOT to
substitute for the startup circuit.

With the TV turned on, momentarily touching the output of a pulse generator
set for 15 KHz and a couple of volts amplitude to the HOT base brings the TV
to life. Everything appears normal except that the TV does not start on its
own. Somehow, I don't think my neighbor would approve of this solution.
(Also, I am not giving up my pulse generator!).

[Caution:] Jump starting a TV like this is risky. In addition to the dangers
of mucking with a live TV, injecting a signal with improper characteristics
into the HOT can destroy it and possible a lot of other circuitry -
instantly. For example, a single cycle with too long an ON time can blow the
HOT from overcurrent while driven on or overvoltage during flyback. Use this
approach with care.

Replacement of the multivibrator transistors with the exact Zenith parts
completes the repair successfully.

Comments: Examining the schematic of the startup circuit reveals that it
appears to be designed to fail - especially with kids about. While the
transistors are rated at 200 V (they are running on the 150 B+ >from the line
power supply), the transistor power rating is only .6 W. Even though they are
running in a switching mode, I believe that repeated on/off cycles can stress
these to the breaking point. Something was mentioned about my neighbor's kids
turning the TV on and off repeatedly. I have not duplicated this experiment
but suspect that such treatment at least may contribute to premature failure.
Fortunately, in this case, it was only in the startup circuit.

Power-on is a stressful time for many types of equipment due to inrush
current, transient voltage, so many things changing quickly, etc. In
addition, designers may not study and characterize the behavior during
startup with the same amount of care that they presumably (we hope) do for
steady-state operation.

@node 26 "Chapter 26) Samsung VCR caught in infinite EJECT loop"

Patientu
     Samsung VCR, Model VR 2610.

Symptoms
     Inserting a tape works fine - it plays, it records, it FFs, it REWs.
     However, attempting to eject a cassette results in an infinite loop -
     the VCR grabs the tape back just before it pokes out of the slot.
     Sometimes, the tape can be grabbed in time but usually the cassette does
     not exit far enough.

Testing
     Symptoms confirmed. With the top off, it is easy to catch the tape but I
     don't suppose this would be an acceptable solution. In addition, the
     cassette carriages seems king of sloppy - loose for want of a better
     term. This would indicate a mechanical problem with the cassette basket
     - the mechanism which moves the cassette into position inside the VCR.

First step: a close examination of the basket mechanism. Nothing obvious - no
broken parts visible.

Next step: attempt to remove the basket. With most VCRs, this is a simple
matter of 4 screws and perhaps a connector. Not here. There are 4 screws, but
once the screws are removed, only one side wants to come loose. The left
side, with most of the gears and whatsits, is firmly fixed to the base of the
tape deck. No doubt, there are critical timing relationships that might be
disturbed once removed. It stays for now.

Perhaps, removing the bottom cover will reveal something. 8 screws later,
bottom cover off. What's this? A spring!! So now, we know that something is
indeed broken and most likely in the basket somewhere. This sort of spring is
not the type to have just popped off - it is a close wound coil spring with
hooks at each end. And, guess what, there is also a tiny bit of white nylon
which was probably the tab onto which the spring was hooked at one end.

A close examination of the visible portions of the basket above and below
deck finally turns up something now that I know generally what I am looking
for. Thankfully, it is accessible and I hopefully don't need to pursue
removing the basket which almost certainly would not be a fun thing to do.

The spring is supposed to be connecting two gear-type wheels in the EJECT
mechanism. With the spring sprung, these were free to rotate when they should
not have and their free play was sufficient to cause the EJECT operation to
screw up.

So, how to repair? There is no good way to glue nylon and even if there was,
the tab is so small that it would be impossible to provide a strong enough
bond to withstand the spring force. Replacement of the part with the broken
tab is a possibility though again not a pleasent one - it would require
removing the basket. Of course, replacing the entire basket is another
unpleasent and expensive options. Installing a metal post in place of the tab
is also a possibility - one that I do not really want to contemplate.

Well, it appears as though there is nothing particularly critical about the
spring placement. Is there an alternative location to connect the end with
the broken tab? Yes, it would appear that it will be sufficient to hook it
around another large wire spring. However, then it is probably stretched too
long, so I make a link out of a piece of a paper clip and this seems to be
about right. (Paper clips, bailing wire, scotch tape and chewing gum (well
maybe not chewing gum) are among my favorite things). Getting all this in
place under spring tension between the edge of the case and the basket
plastic frame proves a bit of challenge - requring a dental picks, needlenose
pliers, patience, and few carefully chosen four letter words - but I prevail.
The EJECT operation now works perfectly.

While not pretty, I believe the newly designed spring attachment will be much
more robust than the original. I should write to Samsung!

Comments: This is a another case of poor design - there can be no other way
of describing it. The spring is rather large (you can visualize it, can't
you?) and the tab much too small. Another .0001 cent of plastic and it would
outlast the rest of the VCR. There was absolutely no excuse as there is
plenty of space to enlarge and reinforce the tab.

@node 27 "Chapter 27) Nintendo Game Console won't reset"

Patient
     Nintendo original game system.

Symptoms
     Power light blinks indicating that it is not able to run the program
     contained in the game cartridge.

Testing
     Tried multiple cartridges without success.

The most common problem with these units is a worn or dirty system unit game
cartridge connector. In this case, the red power/status light will continue
to flash even after the RESET button is pressed with a game cartridge in
place. Replacements are available for about $9 from the usual sources (MCM
Electronics, etc.)

First, I try another game cartridge - the one that is not working may just
have dirty contacts or may be defective. This does not work.

So I need to get inside. Fortunately, unlike some other consumer stuff, this
is quite easy. Six screws underneath followed by about a dozen to remove the
metal shield and circuit board so the connector can be removed and inspected.

Before removing the connector from the circuit board edge, I give the system
another chance to redeem itself. With the latching mechanism removed, it is
possible to press the cartridge down somewhat lower than normal increasing
the chances for good contact. Indeed when this is done, it is possible to
occasionally get a good reset and game startup on the TV. This certainly
confirms the original suspicion.

Now, can I revive the original connector or must it be replaced? There are
three kinds of problems that generally occur with these connectors:

  1. Wear of the contacts to the game cartridge. Although full pressure is
     not applied until the cartridge is latched, there is still wear every
     time a game is inserted or removed. This take its toll. It is often
     possible to use a dental pick or a bent paper clip (one of my favorite
     tools!) to slightly spread the spring contacts so that they grip the
     edge contacts of the game cartridge more tightly. On a high mileage
     unit, however, they may be worn through to the point of actually
     breaking in half resulting in replacement as the only option.

  2. Corrosion at the connector to the circuit board. Cleaning with a pencil
     eraser or at most some very fine sandpaper (600-1000 grit) will usually
     restore to as-new condition unless some really corrosive agent was at
     involved.

  3. Kid grime on game cartridge edge connector transferred to Nintendo
     cartridge connector. Favorites: Coke, sugar candy, and ice cream.

So, the first step is cleaning of both sets of connector contacts and the
main circuit board edge finger. You may need to use a variety of solvents to
completely remove all crud. Water may work better on sugar syrup than normal
contact cleaner or alcohol. For the edge finger, a pencil eraser very useful.

Don't neglect the game cartridge connectors. These generally do not wear but
may collect all kinds of strange stuff. Rather than fight with the security
screws that you may find holding the case together, I usually simply use a
Qtip with water, contact cleaner, or alcohol - or one after the other - to
clean these contacts. Again, very fine sandpaper may be needed in extreme
cases.

Even if these procedures only make a slight improvement - you can press down
on the cartridge and the machine will respond to the RESET button - you have
confirmed that the connector is indeed the problem. In many cases, just
cleaning will result in reliable operation for a long time to come.

In the case of this particular system, all three problems were present.
However, for the time being at least, the system has responded well to
treatment.

Comments: While the original Nintendo game machine is a couple of generations
out of date, many are still in use. And, hey, young kids usually don't care.
OK, you don't have to admit to being the one who cannot resist just a couple
rounds of 'Super Mario III'!

Old Nintendos can usually be picked up for $5-20 at garage sales sometimes
complete with a selection of games, sometimes bare. The games go for $1-$5
depending on the barganing skills of the kid selling the stuff.

However, a bad connector is almost a sure bet with a secondhand system.
Consider that most electronic connectors are typically rated in terms of
hundreds of insertion/removal cycles. A Nintendo machine must endure
thousands of not necessarily gentle cycles over its lifetime. The connector
was not designed for that. Furthermore, you are likely to find all kinds of
muck inside, mostly unidentified, and often difficult to remove. Nonetheless,
these things are remarkably robust, electronic failures are infrequent, and
they can usually be revived without much difficulty.

@node 28 "Chapter 28) Hewlett Packard AN/USM281A Oscilloscope with Multiple Problems"

Patient
     Hewlett Packard AN/USM281A Oscilloscope. This is the militarized version
     of the HP180 lab scope. PL1186 dual channel 50 Mhz vertical plug-in,
     PL1187 delayed sweep timebase plug-in.

Symptoms
     Horizontal position shifted almost off the screen; delayed sweep and B
     timebase inoperative. Alternate triggering erratic at low
     intensities(??).

Testing
     How does one test a scope? Well, put it through its paces with
     reasonable input signals - a 10 MHz clock oscillator provides a nice
     test signal. Maybe another scope would be handy?

Prologue: (You can tell right off that this will be a feature length saga.) I
bought this scope at a garage sale. Now, understand, garage and tag sales
around the Philadelphia area where I live are usually of the "Aunt Minnie's
old silver plate" variety. Electronic equipment is usually limited to
comatose VCRs and color TVs that play in B/W (not that I complain about this
sort of stuff for the right price - as little as possible). However, one
little ad catches my eye: one item amongst all the bric-a-brac is 'test
equipment'.

BTW, I never go to flea markets with any serious intention of buying
anything. It is clear where their stuff generally originates. All the junk I
turn down at garage sales ends up with hugely inflated prices at flea
markets!

I get to THE sale relatively early (I am not quite the garage sale addict
type who gets up at 5 AM to be first in line). All that is visible are a
couple of pathetic old signal generators - one audio, the other RF. Well, $10
for an RF signal generator isn't too bad. I could probably have bargained him
down to $5 but first the all important question: Anything else? (Not that I
expected any sort of affirmative response given the assortment of hat boxes,
deflated basketballs, and old Christmas decorations.) However, surprise
surprise! "There is one other item." So he crawls under a table and drags out
an HP AN/USM281A - a real oscilloscope! "Well, I have this, um, oscilloscope.
It is solid state, dual channel, 50 Mhz, etc." Now, I am paying really close
attention (but of course, not wanting to show it). The only oscilloscopes I
had seen at garage sales until this time (beside my $3 Tek 321, but that is
another story) are usually the really beaten up Eico variety). He is actually
doing a pretty fair sell job. So, how much are you asking? "I would like to
get $100 for it." Very interesting. Can I try it? "Sure." So, he props 'my'
scope on top of a rickety old bar stool (I would have been quite upset if the
thing had gone crashing to the floor but still didn't want to act interested
enough to suggest he find a more stable spot.) I figure that if it appears to
work at all, $100 is a good price even if I have do some repair and
calibration. I fiddle with the controls, also noting that it comes with two
nice looking 1X/10X probes. Suddenly, the scope really cooperates - it must
really want a new home being so lonely stuck in the back of that garage. The
trace scoots off to the right of the screen. None of the front panel controls
have enough range to bring it back. I mumble: I cannot get the trace back. He
says "Oh, um, uh..." Before he can get too far, how about $50. "Sure, ok." I
didn't do enough testing to find out that the delayed sweep was also dead.
For that matter, even with the 10 turn delay time pot in plain view, the
existence of a delayed sweep mode did not register. I only found that out
later. No amount of fiddling would produce any difference between the A
timebase and Mixed A+B. The B timebase was totally dead.

So, how to go about tackling this? I have no service manual, no schematics,
and looking at circuit boards, the semiconductors are HP house numbers. I
didn't have an ECG manual. Fortunately, the component side of the circuit
boards are readily accessible. However, tracing the wiring is a real treat
with HP's love affair with multicolored striped bundled wiring harnesses. I
could try to buy a manual (this was somewhat before the days of
sci.electronics.repair). Nah, that would be cheating (and probably
expensive).  I did try our local HP sales rep when we were looking into their
logic analyzers but he did the usual salesperson thing and lost interest once
we signed on the dotted line.

So, I had to repair it the old fashioned way - ohmmeter, circuit tracing,
seat of the pants, etc.

Objective #1: find the horizontal position problem. Even if the delayed sweep
remains broken, a dual trace 50 MHz scope is very useful. Fortunately, this
problem appears solid now (and not intermittent as was the case previously)
so ohmmeter tests of the horizontal sweep board components should be
possible.  Tracing back from the deflection plate connections to the CRT
finally results in a difference between apparently symmetric sections of the
output stage. An 11 K ohm power resistor tests open! Well, that wasn't too
bad. It doesn't appear as though there is any cause other than age. Replacing
the resistor restores full range control of horizontal position. About 1/2
hour to find. Not too shabby.

At this point, I considered the operation a success and put the other
problems aside. Partially, this was because what I had was usable and
partially because I did not expect the delayed sweep/B timebase problem to be
nearly as easy to solve.

(Actual elapsed time: about 2 years. Well you know how I suggest 'sleeping on
a problem' when you cannot solve it immediately!).

Objective #2: Fix the B timebase. The only help I have with this is the fact
that the A and B timebase circuitry is quite similar so some comparisons of
resistance measurements will be possible. However, for some reason, my first
pass over the components with an ohmmeter does not turn up anything obvious.

Using another scope (a Tek 564), I poke around the B timebase circuitry a bit
to see if I can locate any interesting signals. I suppose my definition of an
'interesting signal' is one that is doing anything - not flatlined.

What's this? A ramp waveform - it must be derived from the A timebase as it
maintains a fixed relationship with the A timebase output but goes into the B
timebase circuitry. My guess would be that this was be used to provide a
gating pulse of variable width controlled by the delayed time (10 turn) pot.
Maybe following this signal will lead to something. Sure enough, it goes to
what must be a comparator circuit since the pot also connects nearby. And -
what is that? A charred resistor! Now, why didn't I see that before?
Fortunately, there is another identical circuit across the board and that
resistor is readable - 100 ohms. Now we are cooking (hopefully not
literally).  With great expectations - switch on. Still no action from the
Mixed A+B or B timebase. As far as I can tell, not a thing has changed. The B
timebase is still as dead as a door nail. The good news is that the resistor
is not getting hot, so that is encouraging - probably.

Next, I continue on with my search for shorted or open parts with an
ohmmeter. This time, I will be more systematic hopefully not missing
anything.  Finally, results! Another blown part. This time, it is a
transistor. From the remaining good junction I can at least tell it is
supposed to be PNP. Measuring the voltages across C-E, it appears as though a
2N2907 will be of adequate ratings (at least voltage wise). Hopefully.
Soldering in the new transistor from the top of the board is not fun - but
more fun than attempting to remove the board entirely. Power: Darn, still no
action.

Continuing with the ohmmeter finally turns up a shorted diode but what type?
Again, duplication comes to the rescue. It is a 54 V zener. I use a pair of
25 V or so zeners temporarily to substitute for this unusual diode. Now,
finally, the B timebase is responding to treatment! Having done what I always
caution against - turning adjustments without marking them - the behavior is
a bit - strange, but the two relevant controls (don't ask me at this point
what they did) could be set for proper operation of the Mixed A+B as well as
B timebase.

How could 3 parts in apparently not directly connected circuits be blown? I
have no idea except to suspect that the previous owner may have attempted to
repair the B timebase and never stumbled upon the actual cause which was most
likely the bad zener but managed to blow other parts in the process.

Objective #3: Determine why turning the intensity way down causes the
alternate sweep mode to get stuck on one trace. This one is a minor annoyance
only and really doesn't affect the utility of the scope in any way. It is
just not quite perfect. I finally locate a couple of adjustments in the
vertical plug-in that seem to have an effect on the rise time of the start of
the sweep or something - they seem to modify the strange behavior as well as
affecting the linearity of the left 1 cm or so of the screen for high sweep
speeds. I finally find a compromise position that seems to be satisfactory.

Wow, a whole bunch of simple problems but now it appears to be in pretty good
condition. A couple of drops of oil for the delay time control, clean the
switches and controls, and a piece of Plexiglas to protect the CRT and it is
done.

Comments: What do they say? "Real engineers don't need no f***ing manuals".
Or is that programmers? Well, whatever. A service manual would sure have made
the task a lot easier. But where is the sport in repairing something with
actual accurate documentation?!

The AN/USM281A is still a good solid easy to use oscilloscope for general
design and debugging. I don't know if this one ever saw duty in the Navy but
I have seen this model going for about $250-300 from test equipment outfits
like Tucker. In my tests, the scope will display a viewable waveform and lock
at frequencies greater than 80 MHz even though the specs are for 50 MHz
vertical bandwidth. The mainframe itself, I think, is rated for 100 MHz. It
uses standard HP180 series plug-ins so if I ever come across any of those at
another garage sale.... (about the same time pigs learn to fly!)

@node 29 "Chapter 29) Magnavox Console TV Deflection Problems"

Patient
     Approximately 10 year old BIG Magnavox color console (when furniture
     meant something).

Symptoms
     Horizontal deflection jittery, possible vertical collapse, arcing
     flyback - all in one set! This info from Dave whose friend owns the set.
     Dave is a tech at work who is now doing more software than hardware (not
     necessarily by choice).

Testing
     I did not actually see the original problems, nor did I have access to
     the entire set as Dave came in one morning with the guts of this set
     under his arm (more like both arms). We actually attempted to power it
     without the yoke or CRT but there was absolutely no evidence of
     anything. Surprise surprise.

Since the original description of the problems is somewhat incomplete, a
visual inspection is made and the HOT is tested for shorts just to be sure.
There were none. However, the visual inspection did confirm that the flyback
had a narrow but rather long (maybe a couple of inches) crack in its housing,
There was no conclusive evidence of arcing but this is one area where the
original symptoms were fairly definitive as the owner stated that there was
arcing around the flyback. (He probably knew just enough to be dangerous, but
hopefully has not done anything we will regret.)

This would explain the jittery horizontal but what about the vertical
problems? Were there really vertical problems. I never did get a good answer
to this question - at least not until later.

While it is likely that the flyback could be patched up at least temporarily,
it was decided to order a new one. The owner was willing to spend up to $150
to repair the set - I have no idea why. No match from places like MCM
Electronics - must go directly to Magnavox (Philips, actually). $71, ouch.
Admittedly, this is one of the spiffiest flybacks I have seen lately (at
least since that A-line Zenith with the cool ribbed plastic coil form). It
has a detachable CRT anode wire - wire and suction cup sold separately! Well,
for $71, you cannot expect everything.

Although we have agreed to order the flyback, I decide to test the old one
anyhow, so next day I bring in my flyback testing widget (12 V chopper, see
"Testing of Flyback (LOPT) Transformers"). This is the first time Dave has
seen this tester and Ed (our chief digital design engineer) is also curious
but stands at a safe distance, having a great deal of respect for a few puny
KV. Ed always stands at a safe distance when anything higher than 5 V is
involved!

First step - locate the HV return. In this case, it is obvious because (1) a
separate bare wire is brought out to a pin and (2) this wire is connected to
no other pins on the flyback. (With a built in HV rectifier, it is not
possible to use a normal DMM to locate this wire.)

Next step - wrap a ten turn coil around the core of the flyback and connect
this to the chopper.

Apply power - a nice healthy arc can be drawn from the HV lead of the flyback
to the return connection, current draw on power supply is low. Flyback is
quite functional. This does not test for breakdown at full voltage but does
rule out hard shorted turns. (Ed can be overheard mumbling something about
sticking with 5 V logic.)

Result is fine by me, owner wants new flyback and this one will make a great
HV supply for a plasma globe or something - someday.

So, we pile the chassis and all its attachments onto a table in the corner of
the testing lab awaiting our shiny new flyback (minus the red wire, some
assembly required). It looks kind of pathetic there but no one else dares go
anywhere near let alone touch it after an off-hand comment about charged
capacitors!

Approximately 5 days later, our new flyback arrives and is soldered into
place.

Next morning: I see Dave pulling up in his Chevy wagon. Guess what is in the
back? The entire huge, heavy TV, belly down. Oops. We quickly find a place
for it somewhat out of the way in a back room.

Apparently, there is no arcing and the horizontal deflection is stable. But,
there is absolutely no vertical at all - flat lined. OK, so the rumors about
vertical collapse were not exaggerated.

A little more visual inspection reveals a couple of interesting observations.
First, all the deflection circuitry - both horizontal and vertical - is
clustered in a small area near the flyback. In addition, the crack in the
crack in the original flyback is adjacent to some of the *vertical* output
circuitry. So, perhaps, the arcing was making its way to something in the
vertical deflection. What kind of output chip is it? Ah, my favorite - a
TDA3654. Fortunately, I have a bunch of them to keep one of my tough dogs
fed.  So, I am well prepared if need be.

A quick measurement of power to the TDA3654 reveals that there is none. Maybe
this won't be so bad after all. Tracing back with an ohmmeter and what do I
find? An open fusable resistor! And, in exactly the right place to be killing
power to the chip. Could it be this easy? Actually - yes in this case. I
install a normal 1 ohm 1/4 watt resistor (only for testing). I also use the
ohmmeter to confirm that the rectifiers in the vicinity are healthy. We are
set!

Power! At first there is nothing on the screen but then snow gradually
appears - and it is full screen. There is no antenna. Of course, reception
inside our building is nearly non-existent due to all the computer RF
interference and steel beam construction. However, we quickly locate a pair
of rabbit ears (or maybe it was just a couple of feet of hookup wire) and
tune one of the few channels that is viewable at all - which happens to be
broadcasting the morning cartoons. But that is just fine. Everything appears
normal and I remind Dave to replace that resistor with a proper flameproof
variety.

Dave cannot believe it.

Ed is nowhere to be found.

Everyone loves the cartoons.

Comments: The mechanism for the vertical failure still remains obscure.
Apparently, the arc caused a momentary but not fatal short circuit in some
part in the vertical output circuitry which blew the resistor. We always hear
how sensitive ICs are to static - here we have 25KV of raw power discharging
nearby with apparently no permanent damage except to a 25 cent resistor.

@node 30 "Chapter 30) Sharp VC7864U VCR Erratic"

Patient
     Sharp Model VC7864U VCR in generally good condition, garage sale
     acquisition, $1 (or was it $2?).

Symptoms
     Former owner complained about difficulty in ejecting.

Testing
     Tried playing multiple cassettes (not all at once!). For the most part,
     the VCR behaved normally. Maybe just a bit sluggish loading but no other
     obvious problems. Why did he dump it?

I did my usual cleaning - rubber parts did not look to bad, leave them for
now. Even the idler tire appears to be in decent condition. I will use the
VCR and see if any problems appear.

The first sign of trouble appears once when attempting to use REVIEW mode -
the VCR abruptly stopped and attempted to unload the tape. The loading motor
was spinning but nothing was happening (I think it was turning in the wrong
direction and the belt was slipping - I am not sure). Oh boy, time to leave
the cover off. Manually giving the motor shaft (fortunately it is accessible
from above the deck) a couple of turns convinces the VCR to complete a
correct unload cycle.

Well, this sounds like the classic 'if it is an erratic Sharp VCR, the mode
switch must be dirty or bad' problem.

(2 years pass as I am in no mood to bother with this repair at the moment.)

OK, now I have a need for a reasonably decent VCR to replace my cousin's
Mitsubishi HS328U which is finally dying. So, I dig the Sharp out of the
closet and see about its condition. Now, it doesn't even want to play a tape
at all. Well, I know I have to deal with the mode switch, so first things
first.

The mode switch on this model is sandwiched between the loading gears and a
mounting plate - all parts of what I will call the 'loading gear assembly'.
To access the mode switch, this entire unit needs to be removed and partially
disassembled. The gears operate the roller guide loading mechanism, and a
couple of cam operated levers which are conveniently hidden when it is
removed or reinstalled. It is driven by the loading motor via a couple of
idler gears.

Timing marks: In the unloaded position, there is a hole in one gear that
appears to line up with a slot. So, with the roller guides retracted (and the
gears which operate this linkage have timing marks which also line up), this
hole should be centered in the slot. Fine. This appears to be the only
critical relationship with respect to removing the loading gear assembly.

I unsolder the 4 connections to the mode switch, remove 3 screws, and -
sproing! What was that? OK, one or both cams still had a lever with spring
pressure applied. Hopefully, it will be possible to extend these these when
replacement time comes along.

With the loading gear assembly removed, it is still not possible to access
the mode switch. Now to disassemble it. There are two fancy cam gears which
obviously must be timed correctly - in one position there appear to be an
arrow and triangular hole which line up. I add a couple of marks of my own
for good measure with a felt tip pen. A simple split washer holds the gear I
need to remove onto its shaft. (Note: these split washers are not designed to
be reused but with care in removal, they can usually be replaced without any
long term problems. Of course, a professional would have an assortment of
replacement sizes handy.) Removing the gear carefully, there don't appear to
be any flat washers or spacers to worry about.

Once the gear is removed - making a note as to which side is up though this
is pretty obvious - the mode switch is exposed. Squeezing the center of the
split shaft enables the cover to be popped off and the interior appears. I
almost lost the springy wiper as it is not fixed to the plastic cover but
popped free when first removed. A frantic search was needed to locate it on
the floor. The wiper fingers and encoder contact traces seem to be in good
condition but whatever was used as a lubricant is a little gummy and might be
the problem. A simple cleaning seems to take care of that. I also bend the
wiper fingers a bit to increase the contact force very slightly.

Now, to get everything back together. First, the wiper is replaced and the
mode switch cover is snapped back in place. Free rotation is confirmed. Then,
the gear that was removed is returned to its shaft along with a cam follower
lever that was under it. The split washer is replaced.

To install the entire loading gear assembly means that the original gear
timing relationships must be re-established. In addition, care must be taken
to make sure those two cam follower levers I mentioned previously are
properly positioned. This takes a bit of work but eventually, I am convinced
that everything works as it should. The screws are tightened and then free
movement of all the parts is confirmed by manually cycling the loading
mechanism. The 4 mode switch connections are then resoldered.

Now for the test. Since this was not a hard failure to begin with, there is
no guarantee that any problems will be detected.

The tape seems to load correctly but then the VCR unloads and shuts down.
What is wrong? It would appear that the takeup reel is not turning. Hum,
probably that rubber wasn't as great as I had assumed a couple of years back.
I now do a more complete cleaning and, in particular, remove the idler tire
and inspect it. It appears to be ok but as a test, I turn it inside-out.

Now, everything works as expected. Testing with a cassette cheater (shell),
there appears to be adequate takeup torque. I clean the idler tire again and
reinstall it in the normal configuration. All modes appear functional even
when testing with a full takeup reel - requiring the most takeup torque. I
will order new rubber anyhow and replace it at a convenient time or if
problems reappear.

This VCR now appears to operate reliably and consistently. I have seen no
evidence of the original erratic behavior. Only time will tell for sure.

Comments: I cannot overemphasize the importance of making careful notes as
well as adding timing marks of your own when removing any parts of a VCR
which could conceivably have critical timing relationships. Not doing this
can really mess up your day. Err on the side of excess - it won't cost you
anything.

Sharp VCRs seem to be particularly prone to mode switch problems: Of the 3
Sharp VCRs under my control, 3 of them have developed dirty mode switches
resulting in a variety of erratic symptoms including, as noted, going into
the wrong mode as well as aborting the tape loading operation for no good
reason.

It would seem that a VCR design using an optical mode switch instead of one
with sliding contacts would be much more reliable at only modest additional
cost. After all, VCRs already use a number of optical sensors and cheap
computer mice use optical encoders not very different in design from a mode
switch. At least, it would be nice if mode switches were readily accessible.
Some are visible as soon as the bottom cover is removed. Others require
substantial disassembly with associated risks of incorrect reassembly
resulting in mechanical timing problems or even damage when the unit is
cycled.

@node 31 "Chapter 31) Sony Servolock Turntable Erratic"

Patient
     Jeff's Sony turntable. Two speed, quartz locked, nice - if you care
     about such things anymore.

Symptoms
     Platter turns but 'lock' light flickers and speed is slow and uneven
     (even to the unaided eye and without listening, it is obviously
     struggling).

Testing
     Both speeds (33-1/3 and 45) have similar problems. The selector switches
     appear to be clean and solid. By gently touching the spinning platter,
     it is found that there is also essentially no torque - it stops very
     easily.

It was quite obvious that the servo system was having difficulty reliably
locking - as evidenced by the flickering 'lock' indicator and lack of torque.
In addition, the platter did not appear to want to start up reliably at some
rotational positions.

So, what does it use as a reference? Remove the platter! This requires
popping a cosmetic cover and large E-clip. Aha, what is this? A little pickup
near the edge that looks sort of like a tape head. However, unlike an audio
or digital tape head, it has a series of offset laminations about 1 mm in
thickness. Not visible but inferred is a magnetic stripe pattern on the inner
surface of the platter which is in close proximity with the pickup when the
platter is installed. Better keep magnets far away. That pattern was put on
with a special jig at the factory - there would be no way to reconstruct it
if some, say, accident were to take place.

As a long shot, I attempt to adjust the pickup closer to the platter surface.
Perhaps the magnetic pattern has weakened or something else has drifted.
Ouch, now it is rubbing. A little further back. Ah, now it is clear.

Not too surprisingly, there is no change. Symptoms are identical.

Now what? Unfortunately, there is no way to get at the circuitry - under the
platter - when the platter is installed. There is no way to excite the
magnetic pickup with the platter removed. Not true! After storing the platter
at a safe distance, a simple magnet will generate a 20 mV signal out of the
pickup. This is probably greater than the normal signal level.

The circuit is pretty simple - couple of transistors and other stuff being
fed from the pickup for feedback and hall effect sensors for motor control.
The motor is a brushless DC 4 pole type with the commutation control external
and on the same board as the servo lock PLL.

Maybe a little signal tracing is in order. Using my magnet, I can see the
feedback signal making its way through to what I assume is part of the PLL -
probably the phase detector.

In retrospect, even suspecting the PLL's feedback signal was probably not
valid. The key is the dependence on rotational position during startup.

So, what about the motor signals? There appear to be two outputs from the
motor (in addition to the coil driving signals). What do these look like? The
first (from H1 - Hall sensor 1) flips between +5 V or so and ground as the
motor rotor is rotated through a complete revolution (Wow, Peter Piper picked
a pack of...., sorry, just practicing.) However, H2 seems to be mostly dead -
stuck at an intermediate voltage and only varying by a fraction of a volt.
Well, that could certainly be a problem.

(If this had not turned up anything, I would have gone on the determine if
the driving signals were correct).

Unfortunately, the actual sensors appear to be under the rotor. First the
rotor and then the entire motor circuit board has to be removed to access H2.
There is a slight risk that removing the powerful rotor magnet from its pole
pieces will cause it to lose some magnetization (this can happen when
removing the rotors of high energy servo motors, for example, if a dummy
rotor core is not slipped in as the rotor is removed). However, I risk it and
the rotor magnet seems to be just as strong as ever when replaced. I stick it
on a piece of soft steel as a keeper to be sure there no possibility of it
weakening while it is off the turntable.

The tricky part is accessing the bottom of the motor circuit board without
ripping up the connections to the (fixed) servo board. The actual Hall effect
sensor is in a four pin package about 2 mm on a side. There is at least a red
dot to indicate pin 1. I use an ohmmeter to double check that the device
itself is bad by measuring directly on the package pins. Confirmed, there is
are very noticeably different resistance readings across the pins of the good
and suspect parts.

I sent Jeff to buy the part (my 'customers' have to do something in return
for free repairs and Jeff can convince anybody of anything).

Fortunately, Sony Parts was happy to sell this $4 (wow!) part to someone who
is not a licensed Sony repair center. They were very helpful in fact, looking
up the part number for H2 in their parts catalog.

Reassembly is straightforward though I had no idea if the alignment of the
sensor was adequate until testing.

Now, at least the waveforms from H1 and H2 are of nearly the same shape and
about 90 degrees out of phase as they should be. Replacing the platter and
the lock light is now solid with decent torque from the motor. The platter
will start quickly and reliably from any initial position.

Next day: Jeff comes in complaining that the turntable is vibrating! Indeed,
during part of the rotation, there is a distinct vibration that can be felt
from the base. What could this be? Best guess is that the pickup needed to
repositioned. And, that was the problem. Apparently, my initial adjustment in
trying to locate the original problem had resulted in the pickup being
positioned further rather than closer from the platter. Some careful
incremental movement and the vibrations disappear.

Comments: The elegant simplicity of this turntable is impressive. Too bad
that turntables aren't really popular anymore. Well, maybe not bad. I cannot
complain about the benefits of CDs though other may disagree. Fortunately,
this turned out to be a motor problem and not an actual fault in the PLL
which would probably have necessitated a schematic.

I am not sure if Jeff ever used the turntable after it was repaired (about 4
years ago) as I cannot imagine him wanting to deal with vinyl. Maybe that is
why there has been no return call!

@node 32 "Chapter 32) Kenwood KX-55C Cassette Deck with Dead Transport"

Patient
     Tag sale Kenwood KX-55C cassette deck marked $2-, as-is, 'dead
     transport'. I paid a whole $1. Otherwise, it seemed in good condition.
     Well, at least they were honest.

Symptoms
     Front panel indicators are alive and the logic seems to repond to the
     PLAY and STOP as there is the sound of a solenoid but neither the
     capstan nor takeup reel shows any indication of even attempting to move.
     There is no sound of a whirring motor.

Testing
     With the cover off, nothing appears locked up - everything turns freely
     and the belts seem to be in reasonable condition. The motor connections
     are readily found. Voltage to the motor is about 10 V in all modes so in
     all likelihood, the problem lies inside the motor casing. The only
     connections to the motor are the two power leads. There is no external
     tachometer or other apparent feedback used for speed control.

So far, this seems pretty straightforward. The motor bracket is fastened to
the transport with 2 screws, a bit awkward to reach but I finally prevail.
The motor itself is contained in an second metal case to provide shielding.
To get inside requires prying off the cover at the non-shaft end with a
screwdriver. So far so good.

Various techniques are used to perform speed regulation in a cassette tape
deck. However, for a totally internal regulator, there are usually only two
possibilities: mechanical governor and voltage regulator.

In this case, it turned out to be the latter - a little circuit board
contained several components including a power device which was shorted. I
was not able to identify or cross reference this part so I decided to make my
own regulator.

However, first I needed to determine (1) if there was anything else wrong
with the deck and (2) the proper voltage for the motor.

The only think I know so far is that the voltage to the motor is less than 10
V.

There is no strobe disk to watch under fluorescent lighting.

Adjusting tape speed:

Make a recording of a single tone on a tape recorder you trust - one with
accurate speed.

My Heathkit audio signal generator and Yamaha cassette deck will do. I use a
variable DC power supply to drive the motor after soldering wires to the
motor terminals and remounting the motor in the deck. Since I will not be
attempting to squash my regulator inside the case, I should not need to touch
the motor again. I hope.

Apply power. Adjust the voltage to the motor to about 5 V and hit PLAY: It
turns! And, there is sound from my amp. Uh Oh, what happened? The transport
went into stop mode. In a VCR, I would suspect an idler tire or belt. What
was that? Did someone say belt? Right, the belt has popped off of the tape
counter. Maybe the tape counter has a contact on it which is used to sense
that the takeup reel is turning.

Now, it stays on but the pitch is way low.

Then, I adjust the speed while listening to this same source simultaneously
with the tape being played back on the unit to be adjusted. As the speed is
adjusted, the pitch changes. As it approaches the correct setting, the tones
beat against each other. When it is set correctly, the pitches will be equal
and the beat frequency will go to zero.

Even if you are tone deaf, it is easy to adjust the pitch accuracy to better
than 1/10 of a semitone using this method.

However, for this initial test, accuracy is not needed as long as the
approximate voltage is determined.

The result: A little over 6 V. Excellent, any vanilla flavor IC regulator
will do that from a 10 V input. The is quite low.

A scrap of circuit board, an LM317 (on heatsink, though this was probably not
essential at the 100 mA or so current required by the motor), a couple of
caps and resistors later, and Presto! a regulator. Speed adjust is done with
a 50 turn pot. (Well, it was handy.) I do not attempt to stuff this into the
motor case but screw it to the power transformer with an insulating standoff.

I now repeat the speed adjustment - more carefully this time.

One thing I do note is that after a few minutes of continuous operation, the
motor speed and thus pitch changes by a detectable but not unacceptable
amount (still only a fraction of a semitone) and then stabilizes. This is not
due to the voltage regulator as the voltage is rock solid. I assume that the
windings of the motor heat slightly and increase in resistance. Well, no
feedback for speed control, what can be expected?

Regulator running cool, repair completed.

(5 or so years later:)

While listening to a tape, motor grinds to a halt. So what is up now?

Take off the cover. Hard to believe I had all the screws installed!

Checking with a voltmeter, there is only a few tenths of a volt across the
motor but normal 10 V at the input to the regulator circuit. With the motor
disconnected, the output of the regulator is exactly correct - 6.3 volts. So
the regulator is most likely fine. What about the motor. Testing with an
ohmmeter reveals that the resistance varies between about .5 and 2 ohms -
much less than I would expect. So, there is a problem with the motor.

It is extremely unlikely that the entire motor shorted out.

This is the classic partially shorted Mabuchi-type motor scenario. I am not
going to let a little motor get the better of me! I first try spraying it out
with some degreaser - no dice, no change. I will just have to take it apart.

The end-plate is held on with a couple of bent metal fingers, pry them out.
However, I cannot just pull the end off as it will rip the delicate metal
brushes in the process. There are two access holes - I usually call them
ventilation holes but I bet their real purpose is to permit a brush spreader
tool (pretty impressive name, probably deserves a trademark) to be used to
allow the brushes to clear the lip on the commutator. My brush spreader
tool(tm) is - as usual - a bent paper clip.

With the end removed, I can now safely pop the entire armature out of the
motor case after removing the pulley (plastic, easy press fit).

(Note, this would be risky with precision servo motors using using high
strength rare earth magnets as the very act of removing the armature could
lead to instant partial demagnetization of the magnets. This is generally not
a problem with these cheap PM motors.)

The commutator looks a bit dirty but the real problem seems to be some metal
particles bridging the segments - probably dislodged by the continuous
rubbing action of the brushes. This is easily cleaned and the gaps between
the segments are cleared with a pointy dental pick.

Now, measuring across any pair of segments results in a 20-22 ohm reading,
much more reasonable.

Reassembly is uneventful and we are operational once again.

Comments: I can never resist attempting to repair a normally non-repairable
part like a motor. Sometimes, they turn out not to be repairable or I loose a
critical tiny tiny part to an unexplored corner of may basement but that is
the exception. In this case, it was quite easy. The motor did not actually
appear worn - the commutator and brushes were relatively smooth and
undamaged. Therefore, a replacement would probably not be substantially
longer lived than my restored motor.

@node 33 "Chapter 33) 19" Hitachi (Sun) Color Monitor"

Author: Ren Tescher
E-Mail: ren@rap.ucar.edu
Date: 6 Mar 1996

Patient
     19" Hitachi-Sun color monitor, purchased at an auction for $50. Hitachi
     HM-4119-S-DA-OL and Sun part number: 365-1073-01 (13w3 video connector)

Symptoms
     Vertical non-linearity (the text at the bottom of the screen was
     vertically compressed, going up it stretched until the top lines were
     'above' the readable part of the screen).

Testing
     described below

Repair procedure: (for qualified electronic technicians only-please!)

   o Unplug power cord and video connector
   o Remove back cover (6 screws)
   o Remove rear panel (9 screws)
   o Remove top shield (10 screws)
   o Remove circuit sub-assembly retaining screw at back bottom center
   o Discharge CRT (!CAUTION HIGH VOLTAGE PRESENT!)
   o Disconnect 2nd Anode
   o Remove CRT grounding strap (1 screw)
   o Unplug CRT socket
   o Unplug degaussing coil
   o Unplug Horizontal deflection coil
   o Unplug Vertical Deflection coil

Lift circuit sub-assembly slightly at the rear and pull back. The assembly
should slide out the back of the monitor chassis. Place circuit sub-assembly
on the bench. Locate electrolytic capacitor C307 (it is on the bottom PCB
near vertical deflection IC (IC300). Replace C307 (47ufd 35volt electrolytic)
(I used a 50volt) noting the polarity of the old capacitor.

Reverse the disassembly procedure and test.

Adjustments:
I found no adjustments were needed.

Elapsed time:
The first one took most of the afternoon, the second one took about an hour.

Disclaimer: Lethal voltages exist inside monitors even after they have been
unplugged, if you do not know where these voltages are or how to nullify
them, do not attempt repairs yourself, but give this article to a qualified
video service technician.

Much thanks to Jason Sodergren (jason@eng.wayne.edu) for pointing me in the
right direction.

Service Manuals (~$55US) are available from:

Tel: (510)661-0777

We also have an HM-4119-S-AA-O (Sun part# 365-1000-01) with a similar
problem. I just completed the repair on the above model and its procedure is
the same. (It is the same faulty capacitor C307). This model was 4 years
older than the other 2, but it is nearly identical inside. Also, thanks to
Hitachi for building a good monitor and making schematics available.

Let me know of your Hitachi/Sony Sun monitor repairs and I'll keep a no-cost

@node 34 "Chapter 34) Magnavox CJ4047 WA21 TV set"

Patient
     Magnavox digital-tuning color TV for a friend. Couldn't tell me how it
     died but promised to be patient with the time it could take me to fix
     it. That's was a GOOD thing. It's been 8 months :-)

Symptoms
     Pre: Dead. Nothing. Well, a tiny squeal could be heard. Determined that
     the HOT was bad (not shorted). Post: While the TV works PERFECTLY
     (sound, tuner, nice vertical line!) with the Horizontal Output
     disconnected (horizontal coil of yoke disconnected), with it in,
     high-pitched squeal.

Testing
     Long story. Original part was on order for months when I finally said
     what the hell and got the non-insulated HOT. I used a mica insulator
     (hint) and replaced a cap in the HOT circuit. When bringing set up on a
     Variac, around 40V sparks could be seen around the HOT. Of course, I
     didn't make the connection, pardon the pun.

The TV was in good shape, as demonstrated by the fact that I could watch a
nice, single pixel vertical picture with the yoke disconnected. The original
HOT was not to be found so I had ordered the non-insulated version (after
months of delay). I first suspected the yoke. I measured about 70 ohms for
the vertical section but only 3.5 ohms for the vertical. However, I checked
all the other TVs I have (waiting to be fixed) and was convinced that this
value was acceptable (it varied from 1.8 ohms for a large 19" to 20 ohms for
a monochrome monitor). So, that wasn't it. I then traced the circuit... as
per Sam's guides, I next suspected the start-up circuit for the HOT... alas
(sigh) that checked out. I DID find a slightly out-of-value cap in the PS,
250V 47uF had become ~15uF but replacing it did not improve anything (I was
going on the assumption that the PS was going into over-current with the HOT
in-circuit but worked fine without it).

Well, that was the end of the line. I then remembered the sparks when
bringing the set on a Variac - GET ONE NOW! - and realized "Duh, maybe the
insulator sparks at that low voltage but downright leaks at full voltage".
This is one of those things that can't really be tested... so I dug up a
strip of silicone rubber insulator and put it in place of the mica. Switched
on the Variac: 30V... no sparks, gentle whine from the PS, 60V... HV UP
(heart rate up), 120V... perfect picture!

The #%&*@ problem was the mica insulator!

Comments: I was SO close to giving up... what kept me going was knowledge
that everything BUT the HOT circuit was fine. I realized what was wrong after
a few days of desperation... the mica insulator is great for low-voltage
applications but it just isn't up to the task as a HOT insulator. Lesson
learned. BTW, I looked over the original HOT and, golly gee, a spark-etched
burn (hole) could be seen on the back surface. If they had used an insulated
HOT AND some insulator, this set would have still been working.

Lesson: Don't use [thin] MICA in HV apps or suffer weird and non-related
symptoms and problems. I used an over-sized strip of silicon rubber
insulator... got it from some stripped device. I gotta get some more :-)

@node 35 "Chapter 35) Panasonic PV 4820 VCR with multiple problems"

Patient:
     Panasonic PV-4820 VCR is basically comatose. Owner says her son tried to
     change the 'fuse' to fix the problem!!???

Symptoms:
     Front panel display is alive but not much else. There is no response to
     any buttons or the remote control.

Testing:
     Tried all the front panel buttons and remote control, unplugging, etc.
     Nothing.

The fuse in the power supply is fine. What the @#$% is she talking about?

Once the top and bottom covers are removed, a thorough visual inspection is
performed. One intersting observation is that the capstan seems to be binding
- the rotor of the direct drive capstan motor is rubbing against the bottom
support bracket. Surely, this cannot be the cause of all the problems, could
it? A little more thought and examination of how the capstan is mounted
reveals the likely answer: there is a white plastic 'knob' with a cross-slot
poking through the main circuit board on top of the VCR. This knob adjusts
the height of the capstan bearing. No doubt the so called 'fuse' that was
attempted to be replaced was this white knob which does kind of resemble a
3AG type fuse holder. OK, mumbling something about no user serviceable parts
inside, I adjusted the capstan height so that it is clear of the bracket and
spins freely. I make a note to check for any problems with the capstan servo
after the main problem is found since as expected, there is no change in
behavior with the capstan free to spin..

Now, back to the main event. Since there are multiple major system problems -
no response to any buttons qualifies - a power supply problem is indicated.
This VCR uses the famous (or infamous) Panasonic switching power supply
(though I did not know of its fame at the time). I locate the power supply
connector and start making measurements. I do not have a pinout or schematic
for this particular power supply but there just happens to be a similar model
Panasonic in the main conference room. How, I wonder if anyone will miss it
for a little while? Any important customers today?

One thing that is fairly obvious: there is no evidence of the typical 5-6
volts that most VCRs use for their logic. The closest voltage is 3.5 V - on a
couple of pins. Checking on the power supply connector of the other VCR,
these pins correspond to the 5.1 V outputs. The other voltages are a bit high
but this is not surprising since there is little load with nothing else
working and the regulation is probably faulty.

Rather than working on the power supply in-place I decide to remove it to the
comfort of my workbench. This is for three reasons. First, if for some
reason, the outputs should skyrocket, I will not have the rest of the VCR to
fry. Next, moving the power supply around will probably break the connections
due to fatigue anyhow (it is soldered). Finally, it is simply more
convenient.  Only 9 or so wires are involved, so no big deal.

Five minutes later....

Now, for a switching supply, I probably need a load at least on the regulated
output. I locate a 15 ohm power resistor, that should be about right for a +5
V low current (probably under 1 amp) logic supply.

Powering up using a Variac feeding my isolation transformer, the power supply
is still outputting +3.5 V on the +5.1 V output. Good, at least it is not an
excessive load problem on the +5.1 V outputs (which would indicate a problem
elsewhere in the VCR. What about the other outputs? Well, they all test
somewhat high (based on the measurements from the other VCR). Thus, an
overload on any of those outputs is unlikely as well.

So, what could be wrong? Next step: draw out the circuit. This isn't a
complicated power supply, no controller chip, just several transistors,
resistors, diodes, an optoisolator, etc.

A half hour or so later, I have a not quite complete schematic. There could
still be errors, but it is mostly there and sufficiently detailed to identify
potentially bad parts.

Since this power supply is basically working - nothing smoked or blew up -
this limits the possible problems considerably.

Testing components in the regulator feedback circuits does not reveal
anything.

What about the optocoupler? With power off, I tack a wire across the input
terminals (low voltage side). Now, if the optocoupler were leaky, this should
make no difference. Bringing up the AC on my Variac, the +5.1 V output
quickly reaches +5 - probably at an input of around 50 VAC - and shows no
sign of stopping there. This is the expected behavior if the optoisolator
were good. Cross that off the list. This also confirms that there is no
excess load on the +5.1 V supply holding it down.

What about the filter components for the +5.1 V? Jumping a good electrolytic
across the input capacitor (C16) of the Pi filter has no effect. So both the
capacitors are likely good as the first should be sufficient to hold
regulation. What else is there? What about the zener, D11? No dice, it and
its buddy, the only other zener, D15, test good.

What else is there? Hey, what is this capacitor, C21? It seems to be in
series between the +5.1 V output and the feedback circuitry? Since it is in
series, leakage is important. I need to swap it or test for leakage
out-of-circuit. I always opt to swap given a choice.

Ah ha! Success. Replacing with a good 1 uF 50 V capacitor results in
precisely 5.1 V. The capacitor, C21, seems to bypass the zener when the
output is changing - it in effect limits the rise of the +5.1 V output. Thus,
if it turns leaky and passes current, not only will the +5.1 V output rise
slower, it will be prevented from reaching its full specified value. The poor
regulator does not know the difference between a rising output and a leaky
capacitor.

Next day, replacing the power supply in the VCR restores full operation.
There appear to be no problems with the capstan. All modes are fully
functional. No other none user serviceable parts appear to have been touched.

I write a little note explaining what 'No User Serviceable Parts' really
means.

Comments: Knowing what I do now, checking C21 followed by C16 and C17, and
then the AC line filter capacitor, C4, would be the first thing to do
whenever one of these or similar Panasonic power supplies shows up with
incorrect output voltages. What this type of failure indicates is that
components like capacitors really are like peas in a pod. When from the same
manufacturer and lot number they are all very similar with respect to failure
modes like drying up and losing capacitance or turning leaky when used in
similar environments.

Most troubleshooting on the professional level is a matter of keeping good
notes and/or having a database of previous repair tech tips. While on the
subject, how about those solder connections in RCA/GE chassis CTC175/76/77
and all the others for that matter?...

As far as that 'fuse'. I must admit, had I known nothing about VCRs, the
white knob does look an awful lot like a fuse holder. To a homeowner, it
represents an irresistible temptation. Fortunately, he stopped short of
attempting to remove the 'fuse' entirely which would have no doubt resulted
in serious damage. And, no adjustment screws had been tightened! Thank you
for small miracles.

     JVC HR-D860U HiFi VCR, about 2-3 years old.

Symptoms
     According to the owner, the VCR gobbled up a tape and her husband
     'removed' the cassette but admitted he really wasn't sure of what he was
     doing(!!).

Testing
     In situations like this, a careful inspection of the mechanism should be
     the first step. For JVCs of this era, parts tend to fall off of the
     roller guide assemblies. In some cases, attempting to play a tape can
     cause expensive damage - a loose roller guide can swing up and smash the
     video heads.

Sure enough, the supply side roller guide assembly was loose on its track and
upon removing the bottom cover, the infamous brass pin fell onto the
workbench. One drop of Epoxy takes care of the roller guide repair.

So what else is wrong? Was any damage caused by removing the tape or playing
a tape with the faulty roller guide assembly?

The VCR appears to be behaving just fine, thank you. At least it played the
one test tape fine that I tried.

Return to owner. Try it.

Next day: It's back: Doesn't work on SLP or pause modes. Uh Oh, that sounds
like a smashed video head. Sure enough, a close visual inspection reveals
that one of the video head chips is broken. Most likely, this resulted from
the roller guide flopping around and/or during 'removal' of the stuck
cassette. Unfortunately, repair price wise, this is a 6 head VCR. Lowest head
price from my source: $71. Ouch. I tell the owner. "That isn't too bad, go
ahead". OK, I guess she remembers what it cost new.

One week later: installation is straightforward as the connections are all to
a circuit board with no flying leads. Pop the new head on and everything
seems to be fine but - what's this - flag waving? Was that there before? I
sort of remembered some on my cheapo monitor with the old head (the part that
was still good, didn't think much about it at the time).

So, I go and try the VCR on the Panasonic TV in the main conference room. A
little better, still some flag waving. However, everything else seems normal
- back tension in particular. It could just be my tapes. If recorded on a VCR
with significantly different back tension and/or video heads that are not
perfectly aligned on the drum (not a user or tech adjustment), flag waving is
possible and does not indicate anything is wrong - just different. Many TVs
will have a suitable fast vertical sync response or a special channel with
this characteristic so not generally a problem.

I returned the VCR, concerned that it would still not be quite right. But,
next day, everyone was happy and even with my description, had no idea what I
was talking about. Plays just like new. Flag waving, what's that?

Comments: this is one of those situations where the recommendation: "always
confirm what does and does not work before touching a piece of equipment"
applies fully. Unfortunately, with the broken roller guide, this was not
quite possible at the outset. However, I should have paid more attention to
the behavior once the roller guide was repaired and before replacing the
video head drum.

Interestingly, this was one of my first contacts with the JVC parts shedding
VCRs but in the next couple months, came across two more JVCs - one with a
dropped brass pin and the other with a loose plastic hinge pin in the roller
guide positioning linkage. Then, I 'fixed' a coworker's JVC over the phone
(425 miles away) by his description of the symptoms: "Sure, you lost a brass
pin. Pull the bottom off....".

VCRs really are like peas in a pod.

@node 37 "Chapter 37) Panasonic VCR with video noise, audio hum, and erratic operation"

Patient
     Panasonic VCR with several problems. Owner's complaint is video noise -
     sometimes the video disappears to be replaced by noise.

Symptoms
     Indeed, video playback is poor. Tracking does not help. At times, the
     video totally disappears as though the heads are clogged. I also note
     that there seems to be a hum in the audio at times and there is some
     erratic operation when switching modes.

Testing
     I tested with multiple tapes. Thoroughly cleaned the video heads using a
     cleaning tape, then cleaning sticks, then my thumb. In no case was clear
     video totally restored and the heads seemed to get clogged quite
     quickly. There is definitely hum in the audio. Occasionally, when
     entering play, the VCR will abort and unload.

This may be a case of multiple independent problems.

The hum leads me to suspect the power supply. This VCR uses a power
transformer, rectifier, filter capacitor prior to linear regulators.
Fortunately, unlike some Panasonic VCRs, the power supply in this one is
easily removed and may be tested easily. Putting a scope on the main filter
capacitor reveals that there is quite a lot of ripple - and that it is also
somewhat erratic in amplitude. This could indeed account for the hum and
erratic behavior. Some simple calculation show that the capacitance must be
reduced by 75%. I locate a capacitor that is still perhaps only 2/3 of the
labeled value and jerryrig it in place. The ripple is now much much reduced
and the hum is gone. Time will tell whether the erratic operations is cured.

The owner was probably not even aware of these problems!

Now for the video problems - which are unchanged.

All symptoms point to a bad head. It is quite likely this machine has seen
significant use. The owner is apartment bound and spends a lot of time in
front of TV.

Indications of a bad video head include:

   o Any visible damage to the ferrite chips.

No visible damage in this case.

   o Excessive video snow which cannot be eliminated by the tracking
     controls. An image where more or less good video alternates with snow at
     a 30 Hz rate means that one of the 2 heads in a pair is either dirty or
     bad.

Definitely present at times.

   o Excessive video snow or no picture on some playback speeds (SP, LP, EP,
     still) since different sets of heads (in 4 head or more) machines are
     often used for different speeds. If this is due to wear, then it would
     probably gradually deteriorate and not happen suddenly.

Yes as described above. This is a two head machine so all speeds are
affected.

   o Inability of certain internal adjustments such as backtension to
     eliminate erratic tracking problems may indicate a worn video head.
     Horizontal bands of video noise may come and go at various places in the
     picture depending on what speed is being used or the playback location
     on the tape (beginning, middle, end). These may come and go in a
     periodic cycle.

No significant response to backtension. All guideposts seems to be locked
solidly in correct position.

   o Need to frequently clean the video heads even if you are only using new
     good quality (name brand) tapes. Video heads are normally self cleaning
     but very worn heads can tend to collect tape oxide resulting in a noisy,
     snowy, or totally missing picture.

Absolutely - even after a manual cleaning (or using the Mark 1 Thumb), bad
video seems to return quite quickly.

   o You have just been playing a rental, damaged, or spiced tape and you
     notice any of the above symptoms.

She mostly plays old tapes. However, as noted there is no visible damage.
Nonetheless, old worn heads may be more prone to clogging.

Given that most of the qualifications for bad video heads are met, I go and
order a new upper cylinder from MCM Electronics. It is about $30.

This does indeed eliminate the video snow.

There is no further evidence of the hum or erratic behavior.

Comments: This VCR gets heavy use. I had cleaned it a few months before the
present episode and noted at that time that video playback was not that
great.  But at the time, it didn't seem poor enough to warrant the expense of
head replacement. However, now it was definitely unusable. The gradual and
progressive degradation is a classic symptom of worn video heads.

@node 38 "Chapter 38) JVC 6 Disc CD Changer Gets Stuck"

Patient
     JVC 6 disc cartridge type CD changer used by Chinese restaurant for
     background music.

Symptoms
     Music gets stuck on outer tracks of some discs. Sections start
     repeating, stuttering, etc.

Testing
     All CDs exhibit the same problems at approximately the same time into
     the disc.

History: This is the infamous 'Chinese Restaurant' CD player. I believe the
problems started when after several years, they decided to change or add a
disc. Yes, believe it or not, we had been subjected to the same music for as
long as we had been visiting this restaurant - at least a couple of years. We
were regulars. On this occasion, we were just getting through the soup (these
are the full course lunch specials) when, what was that? The music got stuck
for an instant. Being into this stuff, my ears are tuned to typical CD
problems. Must have been my imagination. Then, halfway through the main
course (Shrimp with Lobster sauce), there it was again. This time, it really
got stuck, repeating the same measure for several minutes before anyone
noticed and shut it off. Never being able to refuse a challenge, when
settling the check, I inquire: so music broken? "Yes, not work." OK, I fix.
So we walk out of there with this CD player under my arm and something to do
for the afternoon.

Problems of this sort are almost always mechanical with simple causes and
easy solutions. Attempting to play a disc - now it was totally incapable of
even recognizing the index - resulted in the motor that moves the optical
pickup just spinning its wheels. The worm gear was not moving and the pickup
remained stuck about 3/4 of the way to the outside of the disc. Giving it a
little help, resulted in resetting to the inner track limit and then
successfully beginning to play the disc.

The most difficult part about this affair was getting to the worm gear as the
optical deck is mounted upside-down and to remove it requires partially
disassembling the changer mechanism. However, once this is done, the problem
is quite obvious: Chinese grease! The last 1/4 portion of the worm gear is
gummed up. As noted, the same 6 discs had been playing for as long as I can
remember and none of these ever got to this outer track location. In addition
to cleaning and oiling the worm gear, I decide to order a new belt which
couples the motor to the worm gear as the slipping has probably weakened it.
However, I will return the player to them in the meantime as it should work
for a few weeks at least.

Well, that was about 3 years ago. The same new set of discs is still playing
and I still have that replacement belt sitting in my desk drawer. We did get
a free meal for the 3 of us out of the deal.

Comments: I know that many people are very careful to pamper their equipment.
However, unless the various mechanisms are fully exercised to their limits at
least occasionally - be it the pickup on a CD player or the suspension on an
automobile - dirt, grime, and corrosion can set in and result in expensive
repairs later on. At least that is my theory.

Despite my general low opinion of many JVC products, I have to admit that
this CD changer has been very reliable. It has probably been running 8-10
hours a day, 6 days a week, for over 5 years requiring only this one minor
cleaning and lube job during the entire time. That is not a bad record!

@node 39 "Chapter 39) Mitsubishi HS-318UR VCR Dropped"

Patient:
     Mitsubishi HS-318UR VCR apparently fell off the TV where it was perched
     from a height of about 4 feet. Owner had taken it to a repair shop for
     an estimate - it was recommended he get a new VCR. So, this was
     basically given to me. Well, loads of thanks! He also had some broken
     pieces in a little plastic bag - a corner of the front panel and a bit
     of a circuit board.

Symptoms:
     Totally dead, no display, no other signs of life. (Yes, I know, you are
     not supposed to plug in a dropped VCR until a thorough visual inspection
     is made inside and out.)

Testing:
     Not applicable.

This is an irresistible challenge. Aside from the chipped corner of the front
panel, there doesn't appear to be any exterior damage. But, the piece of
circuit board is ominous as it is apparent that there are numerous traces
broken - and probably more inside.

Overall, VCRs are quite tough. However, falling in just the wrong way can do
substantial and possibly not immediately visible damage. I have heard of
someone fighting off a would-be mugger with a VCR but this too is not
recommended practice!

In this case, the shop's estimate was way beyond what the VCR was worth and
the owner was perfectly happy to upgrade to a newer model. I did make sure to
get the remote control from him just in case a miracle happened - or the
remote was the only way left to access the major functions.

After removing the top and bottom covers and front panel, the extent of the
damage became evident. The good news was that the main board appeared to be
intact and the mechanism itself has no obvious damage though this will not be
fully confirmed until the electronic problems are addressed. At least, there
are no obviously broken or bent parts - and no loose screws or other parts
fall out. Nothing has popped loose.

I cycle the cassette loading and tape loading mechanism manually by turning
the appropriate motor shafts. Everything appears to be free and seems to
operate properly.

Inspecting for broken electronic parts does not reveal anything. At least the
display is undamaged. However, the corner of the front panel display board is
broken off - this is the piece in the plastic bag - thank you for saving it!
In addition, cracks have propagated in a couple of directions cutting even
more traces. Yuk. And, these are really, really fine traces. Double yuk. And,
this is a double sided board. Triple yuk. Why couldn't the display have
cracked in two - put it out of its misery.

There is always a slight risk that the initial impact has already fried
electronic parts as a result of a momentary short or from broken circuit
traces and there will still be problems even after repairing the visible
damage and/or replacing the broken components. Or, for that matter, that my
initial power test fried something else. Well, nothing ventured, nothing
gained.

Optimistically, at least 25 - possibly considerably more - 10 mil width
traces are cut. Some of the breaks are only visible with a strong magnifying
glass but as they say, a break is a break is a break.

First, I repair the board physically with some quick setting Epoxy. It almost
looks like a circuit board again. There is one little piece that is missing -
and some traces go smack through its center. Well, you cannot have
everything!  Since, this is going to be a feature length restoration, I
decide to remove the display board from the VCR - unfortunately, it is
soldered in, 40 or 50 pins worth. At least, this is straightforward, just
tedious.

With the board removed, it will at least be easier to get at both sides as
needed. There is no particularly good place to start - they are all equally
bad. Well, every journey begins with a single first step....

Where I can locate suitable end points, I solder fine wire (insulated #30
wirewrap wire) between these terminals. However, in many cases, it is simply
not possible to trace far enough to locate the ends. In these cases, I use
bare #30 wire directly across the break. A few I take a short cut and just
bridge with solder - this will bite me in the end.

I attempt to double check each connection after soldering for correct wiring
and that there are no shorts before proceeding to the next.

Unfortunately, one small piece of circuit board is completely missing and
traces pass through this piece. I guess as best as possible the routing of
these traces and hope. It seems to be part of the tuner memory circuit.

After what seems to be an eternity - it is probably on the order of 5 hours -
I am prepared for the smoke test. This requires reattaching the connections
to the mainboard and I will thus loose the mobility of having the display
board separate. Well, so be it. This isn't even fun!

I plug it in! Well, no smoke at least. The display shows blinking 12:00.
Progress! Still, ready to pull the plug, I hit the power button. What do you
know - that even works. And there is some sound from the transport
initializing.

Now to try the various functions. Let's see, no response from clock set,
channel up, tuning controls. It is obvious that there are still a bunch of
problems. Other anomalies: the Quick Record indicator is stuck on. What's
this? The display just went dark. Oops, there is is back again. Pressing on
the board seems to have an effect. There is still an intermittent somewhere.

Well, this is a start. Back to work....

Solder, solder, solder. After finding a half dozen more broken traces that I
missed on the first go around, try again. Now, the clock can actually be set
(well, except for the minutes). Quick record is still stuck. There goes the
display off again. So the intermittent is still intermittent. Ouch! Why is
the controller chip so hot? Pull the plug. Checking over the connections,
nothing seems amiss but in the rats nest that the back of the board has
become, who can say?

Following some traces that run under the display, I locate and repair a
couple more that I had missed before. I rewire those few traces that I had
just bridged with solder. I never do figure out exactly how the traces
running through that missing bit of board should be wired.

This is as good as it will ever get.

For some reason, the Quick Record light is now out, I have no idea why. The
display at least seems solid. The controller chip is cool again. Also have no
idea why. Now to try a tape....

Success of sorts. The tape will play but the sound is muddy. CUE, REV, FF,
and REW even work. It is not possible to reset the tape counter and it is
also not possible to set the channel memory. Previously set channels can be
tuned so that, at least, is not really a problem. And, who needs the stink'n
tape counter anyhow.

It is not possible to adjust the A/C head azimith enough to get truly good
sound. Only later, do I discover that the tape I was using for testing had
been recorded on a VCR with incorrectly set azimith so this was probably a
non-problem.

Just when I thought success was in hand, all of a sudden, after playing for
about 10 minutes, the tape suddenly speeds up to about 10X normal with mickey
mouse sound and loses sync. This is not CUE mode but yet another problem. The
STOP button works but EJECT overshoots the correct stopping position as the
main motor is obviously operating at increased speed in all modes. Resetting
requires unplugging the VCR for a few minutes and manually rotating the EJECT
gear a couple of turns. This is going to be a peculiar way to watch a movie!
Something is obviously heating up, possibly causing a failure of one or more
of the power supply voltages.

After spending about 15 hours on this VCR, I am in no mood to (1) give up
after being so close or (2) do any more serious work. Is there an
alternative?  Yes, let me cheat. Maybe simply providing a bit more cooling to
the power supply will keep it happy. So, I dig up a little blower removed
from a defunct ultrasonic humidifier and prop it behind the VCR. Can this
possibly work? The answer is - yes. Apparently, the added cooling is just
enough to prevent the thermal runaway problem. Now, it is actually possible
to play or record a 2 hour movie (first experiment: Star Trek IV). With this
setup, the VCR will play or record indefinitely without spontaneously going
into warp drive mode.

Comments: If you take a piece of equipment that has been dropped into a
repair shop, the estimate you get may make the national debt look like pocket
change in comparison. Attempting to repair a VCR or any other complex device
that has been dropped is a very uncertain challenge - and since time is money
for a professional, spending an unknown amount of time on a single repair is
very risky. There is no harm is getting an estimate (though many shops charge
for just agreeing that what you are holding is - a VCR!)

I suspect that the final problem - the thermal runaway is not related to the
repairs I made on the display board but due, perhaps, to a heatsink that was
loosened that I did not notice. Since the small amount of additional cooling
provided by my blower was adequate to keep the VCR happy, it could even have
been a pre-existing condition that just did not show up in a cooler location.

While a lot of effort was expended on this single restoration, for me it was
well worth it. This was my first VCR. Despite the less than total success,
the satisfaction was considerable. While the HS-318UR has long since been
retired I still hesitate to cannibalize it for parts figuring that it has
some historical significance.

@node 40 "Chapter 40) Mac Plus with no Video"

Patient:
     A colleague's Apple Mac Plus computer. Another state-of-the-art piece of
     technology. But, hey, these things are still useful.

Symptoms:
     Power-on results in nothing on the screen and the familiar friendly
     'bong' is missing as well. Just some unidentified electrical noise
     indicating that it is getting power.

Testing:
     Nothing with the case on. It is obviously not operating as a computer
     and does not go through the normal boot sequence or even get to the
     point of asking for a diskette.

This is the 'classic' all-in-one style Mac, physically almost identical to
the original MacIntosh computer and the Mac 512K. The much newer Mac Classic
is constructed along similar lines. All require the special 'extra long Mac
wrench' (1 foot long Torx) to get at the two screws under the 'handle'. Not
having one of these (or actually, having lost mine), I make a suitable
substitute by grinding down the end of a triangular file handle. It works
quite well, thank you.

There are 5 Torx screws: 2 lower rear, one inside the backup battery
compartment, and 2 under the handle (they are not all quite identical
depending on if they screw into plastic or metal). Once the screws are out, a
case splitting tool is supposed to be used but a wide straight blade
screwdriver or other metal strip can be used CAREFULLY to separate the two
sections of the case without damage.

With the case removed, I start by examining the large Molex connectors for
damage and cold solder joints - there are none apparent (at this time).

How to identify voltages? Well, the floppy is pretty standard, so at least +5
and +12 should be easily found. OK, +5 is low and +12 is very low. Something
is probably shorted. How about some ohmmeter checks? Since this is probably a
monitor problem, the natural place to start is the horizontal deflection
circuit. The small B/W monitor used in the Mac Plus runs off of +12 on the
isolated side of the main switchmode power supply so at least this will not
be a shocking experience.

Hmmm, HOT (BU406) is a dead short. It also appears to have seriously
overheated as the circuit board at its legs is somewhat blackened. The most
likely cause of overheating followed by failure is a bad flyback.

Nothing else in the vicinity appears bad based on the ohmmeter tests.

How does one test a flyback transformer?

Three ways:

  1. Compare resistance readings of windings with a known good flyback. If
     these match, substitute it. I really like this one and for a short test,
     it is low risk - the chance of ruining a good flyback on a low voltage
     deflection circuit is quite small. It is also a definitive test.

  2. Perform a 'ring test'. Pulse a winding in parallel with a capacitor and
     see how quickly the oscillations die down. A shorted turn or two will
     totally kill the Q of the flyback.

  3. Drive it with a known good chopper - this is my fun flyback tester - and
     confirm that it does not load the drive circuit significantly and that
     it puts out some high voltage.

See the document: "Testing of Flyback (LOPT) Transformers" for further info.

Happily, (1) is an option as I have a good Mac Plus just sitting around doing
nothing (you don't act surprised!). There appear to be several variations on
the basic flyback model - 157-0042B/B but they appear to be interchangeable.
Unfortunately, the ohmmeter comparison is inconclusive and cannot test the HV
winding in any case.

So, I decide to swap the flybacks - it is only 8 or 10 solder connections, so
quick and painless. I rummage around in my junk box (you probably get the
idea that my junk box is as big as a rail car) and locate a BU406D. The built
in damper diode should not hurt anything (there is an external one in the Mac
already).

Installing the transistor on its heatsink and soldering in the flyback takes
all of 5 minutes. Now for the smoke test. There is probably no need (and no
easy way anyhow) to use a series light bulb or Variac to limit the current.
The Mac switchmode power supply is current limited and unlikely to be able to
kill the HOT in the few seconds it will take to verify that the screen comes
up. I will know almost immediately if the voltages are more normal as the
friendly bong should sound almost as soon as the power switch is flipped.

And, indeed it does. A few seconds later, I am greeted with the inquiring Mac
Icon and inserting a boot disk results in the smiling Mac Icon and a proper
boot sequence. The picture appears to be bright, well focused, and stable. A
few tweaks to position and size, and it is perfect.

Now to order a flyback. $14.99 from MCM Electronics. I leave the BU406D in
place permanently.

Three years later: it's back!

New set of symptoms: single vertical line. This is a classic (no pun
intended) problem with Mac monitors - bad connections to the deflection yoke.
And, sure enough, whacking it brings back the horizontal, though it is
somewhat erratic.

The cause is obvious: one pin of the Molex yoke connector has staged a Three
Mile Island. It is totally melted and the normally white plastic is blackened
and brittle.

Rather than replacing the connector, I elect to just do a bypass and solder a
jumper from the remaining wire stump directly to its destination on the
monitor circuit board. Who ever removes yoke connectors anyhow? The remaining
three pins and sockets (1 horizontal and 2 vertical) appear to be in perfect
condition so I leave them alone.

I like easy problems for a change of pace!

Comments: Old Macs, like JVC VCRs that lose parts and Sony TVs with bad tuner
shield soldering, have a particular set of problems that are nearly
universal.  Run a Mac Plus long enough and you WILL see a bad Molex connector
or dead flyback.

The flybacks usually fail either by shorted turns in the primary or
secondary. Cracked cores or HV rectifier failures are also possible but not
common). When it is a primary short, I believe there is a good chance the HOT
will blow if not caught immediately. A secondary short may just increase the
load enough to cause overheating but not immediate failure. Sometimes, there
will still be enough high voltage generated to have some light on the screen
but the picture, if any, will be highly distorted. (I have a few Mac flybacks
at this point and it seems to be a toss up as to which set of windings
failed.

I like it when the primary goes bad because I can then perform a flyback
primary windingectomy and have a very nice core and high voltage winding for
constructing neat and nifty high voltage invertors. Generating more than
12,000 VDC from 12 VDC is quite easy and reworked Mac flybacks used in this
manner seem to be virtually indestructible. See the document: "Various
Schematics and Diagrams" for a couple of complete designs using previously
owned, low mileage flybacks.

@node 41 "Chapter 41) A Tale of Two Toshiba PA8706 AC Adapters"

Patient:
     Toshiba PA8706 power adapter (Supply #1) for a colleague's T1000XE
     laptop. I can hear everyone saying "right, one of those really
     state-of-the-art computers". However, the power adapters for newer
     models are quite similar so any lessons learned are still valuable.

     A second identical power pack will be pressed into service for the loan
     of some of its organs.

Symptoms:
     When the bad supply is connected to a laptop with a known good battery
     pack, the red power LED flashes continuously. No amount of reinserting
     the battery or plugging/unplugging the adapter's DC plug clears the
     fault. (These contortions are sometimes needed when starting with a
     totally dead battery and are sort of normal.)

Testing:
     A voltmeter reveals that the output, 12 VDC, is cycling at the same rate
     as the LED. This occurs whether connected to the laptop or not.
     Comparing this with a good adapter shows that even without a load, the
     output should be a steady 12 V. The other power pack works fine with
     this laptop as well. Therefore the fault is definitely in the power
     pack.

These power packs are actually universal (90-240 VAC or DC) input switching
power supplies which makes for a much more exciting adventure than a simple
transformer!

The first challenge was getting inside. There were obviously snaps around the
sides but it took a bit of detective work (read: the @#$% thing would not
split in two) to determine that there was a concealed Torx screw (fortunately
not of the security variety) under the manufacturer's label. Once this was
removed (by puncturing the decal rather than pealing it back), the case came
apart easily. At least it wasn't sealed and potted in Epoxy.

So, what do we have? It looks like a fairly typical small switcher - line
filter, bridge rectifier, filter capacitor (big!), switching transistor and
rectifier diodes in TO220 cases mounted to a full length heatsink, C-L-C 'pi'
output filter. Part types for the power semiconductors cannot be determined
immediately because of silicone rubber heat sink boots that entirely conceal
the devices.

Uh oh, what's this? A conformal coated hybrid controller. I better hope it
isn't bad as there is NO way of determining what is inside. Obtaining a
replacement would no doubt be impossible as well. Naturally, this is the
first component that I suspect - wrongly, of course.

Well, what does a cycling output mean? Usually, this is an indication of an
overvoltage or overcurrent condition forcing the controller to continuously
shut down the supply and restart. A common cause for an overcurrent fault are
shorted components on the secondary side of the supply. Overvoltage may
result from defective regulator feedback components. The controller may
simply be bad and misinterpreting the overcurrent and overvoltage sense
inputs.

What does the output look like? On my analog VOM which has a fairly fast
response, it appears as though it is cycling between 0 and a full 12 V (not
something in between that would indicate a severe overload or short. Running
the supply on a Variac reveals that the frequency of the cycle decreases as
the input voltage is reduced but that the voltage swing remains the same.

What is likely: the main switchmode transistor is probably good but there may
be shorted devices in the secondary side of the supply resulting in
overcurrent, a defective regulator resulting in overvoltage, or a faulty
sense circuit incorrectly shutting the supply down.

So, as always, I test all of the semiconductors that I can identify with an
ohmmeter. Of course, I cannot do this on the hybrid circuit so there is an
uncertainty that I might have missed something. However, everything I can
test checks out fine.

What is next? Capacitors, resistors. All of these seem fine. I substitute
some small electrolytics just to be sure. No change. Removing the output
filter capacitors one at a time also results in no meaningful change. (Maybe
the cycling rate increased - I did not check.)

At this point, I am temporarily out of ideas and the supply gets shelved for
a few months. There is a spare but no one is eager to give it up (or maybe I
just don't want to ask) for parts swapping - which is what I really want to
do. Guess which part I want to swap?

A garage sale comes to the rescue as I find an identical power pack marked $5
but it is late in the sale (after all, how many people collect these things!)
and I get it for $2.50. Whether it works or not, this is a handy source of
parts - as long as it does not have the identical problem.

Supply #2: I plug it in and measure its output - nothing. Humm. A dead power
pack could mean anything but as with any AC adapter, the first thing to check
is the wire. And, sure enough, a little squeezing and bending of the DC plug
end results in momentary contact and 12 V out. No doubt, the original owner
spent the $60 or so for a replacement - not having read the FAQ on AC adapter
repair.

Now, with a little effort, I should have a working power pack - and a source
of known good parts as well. It turns out not to be such a simple repair as I
have to carefully slit the rubber plug cover and then fish the good wire ends
through that to reattach them to the plug itself. As they say, not difficult,
just tedious. I have been there before.

Back to Supply #1. Now, I start swapping like crazy. The hybrid controller is
first, of course. As you guessed, no change. Next is the transformer, then
the switchmode transistor (a MOSFET), capacitors. No change, no change, no
change.

Finally, the one part that I should have suspected all along - even if my VOM
said it was good - the 12 V rectifier. Swapping this part - a TO220 with a
pair of high efficiency (or something) fast recovery diodes did the trick. I
know, you are saying: bozo, even in your FAQ, you say to never fully trust an
ohmmeter test. Well, it finally did bite me.

Comments: Most of the time, silicon semiconductors stay broken once they fail
but not always. In this case, for whatever reason, the diodes would work like
- well diodes - for long enough to provide full output voltage but then one
or both of them would turn into short circuits or at least develop high
leakage. Thus, reducing the input voltage would lengthen this cycle as it
would take longer for full reverse voltage to develop on the diodes as a
result of the filter capacitors charging.

With switching power supplies it is always tempting to blame the controller,
transformer, and switchmode transistor - because they are expensive,
difficult to obtain, or both. However, for a supply that shows some signs of
life, these components are rarely the cause of the problem.

Swapping parts between a working and dead unit - or between channels of a
stereo amplifier or dual channel oscilloscope - is always an ideal way of
eliminating selected parts from suspicion. It is a definitive test. There is
a slight risk (maybe not so slight with power supplies and power amplifiers)
that putting a good part into a circuit with some other fault will blow the
good part. But, this risk can generally be minimized by using a series light
bulb along with a Variac to limit current to the critical semiconductors.

@node 42 "Chapter 42) Right channel dead in Sansui 2000X receiver"

Author: John Heinrichs
E-Mail: jheinric@albedo.colorado.edu
WWW: http://ucsu.colorado.edu/~heinrich/Home.html

Patient:
     Sansui 2000X receiver

Condition:
     Purchased from a friend for $10 if I can fix it. According to previous
     owner, right channel completely dead and left channel distorted. Chassis
     loose in wooden cabinet (obviously an earlier aborted attempt at
     repair). No manuals or schematics. This is a superb receiver, 85
     watts/channel of clean, warm power. High-end unit in the mid-70s. Not
     only that, I had previously picked up a matching Sansui RA 500 analog
     reverb unit for $6 at an auction and wanted to put the two together.

Approach:
     I started, simply enough, by checking the output fuses. Right channel
     fuse missing, left fuse looks OK. Aha! Easy enough... Moved the left
     fuse to the right and put a new fuse in the right. Replaced the fuse,
     thinking this was gonna be a good story. Now to plug it in and see what
     happens. Right channel dead, but left plays great. That stuff about
     distortion must have been a mistake.

Next suspect - the power output transistors. Sure enough, two of the four
transistors have a direct short from the base to the emitter. Pulled 'em out
and hooked 'em up to a Heathkit transistor checker (they are 2SC1111s, so are
NPN silicon). Leakage current at 100%. Being short on cash right then, I went
to my parts stock and found a set of four MJ423s taken, I believe, from a
junked laser power supply. According to the Motorola guide, they are also NPN
silicon and have a significantly higher breakdown voltage (325 V) than the
originals. This amplifier is a pretty simple design and certainly too early
for the fancy Darlington push-pull amps we see today. So I'm pretty sure I
can drop the MJ423s in with no problem. When I power up the amp again, still
no change. With a gasp, I shut it down and pull out the replacements and
check them again in case the real problem had fried them. They're OK, though.

Now I look a bit further. Are the low-value (0.5 ohm) power resistors
discolored? No, but I pull out the meter for an in-circuit test, which will
work since 0.5 ohms is much less than the total resistance of the rest of the
circuit. One of the four resistors is a dead short. Again, I go to the parts
bins and find a great 0.5 ohm replacement (3% tolerance, no less) but the
leads are too short. So I solder on some lead extensions and replace the bad
one. Power up - now I'm getting a very weak signal on the right channel.

Tracing the wires backwards, there's a small circuit board (in a card socket,
thankfully) that looks connected to the power transistors. So I pull the
board out. Aha! A large black discoloration surrounds what's left of a 100
ohm resistor (the only way I can tell the value is by comparison with the
duplicate circuit for the left channel). The resistor reads open, so I
replace it, along with a nearby 0.1 microfarad capacitor that is a little
discolored and has cracks in the outer insulation. Put the card back in and
power it up. No improvement.

I start looking around and find a transistor that looks suspect. A cheap bent
metal heat sink is glued to the transistor case with some brown gunk.
Compared to the corresponding component on the left channel, the one on the
right has an even darker color to the gunk, which looks crumbly. So I try the
transistor checker (I have an in-circuit tester, which I recommend highly)
and it shows a leakage current of about 30%. This one I manage to find in my
guides and it shows a 2N2222A as a replacement. I've got plenty of these from
earlier dissections, so no problem. After swapping this transistor out, the
right channel comes up much better on headphones. Sounds mighty fine, in
fact.  So I hook it up to speakers. Now the right channel is highly
distorted, which increases with volume. When I hook the right channel up to
my scope, the waveform is distinctly clipped and only the negative signal
excursions show up. Looks like the waveforms I get with the overdriven
diode-clipped op amps I use for guitar distortion.

As I recall, I spent the next four hours or so checking every component I
could on that little circuit board. I even went so far as to remove each of
the remaining three or four active components and switch them between
channels. No change - still distorts under a load. Then I started to do a
detailed analysis of the circuit itself - actually developing a schematic -
and discovered that the connections at the board edge were symmetric. Well,
thank those engineers back in the 70s! I inserted the board into the
connector reversed and again found no change in the distortion. Now I'm just
about pulling my hair out. At least I know the board isn't the problem.

Now to look at every possible connection in the signal path. Speaker switch
checks out fine. Only thing left is the output fuse. Fuse still looks good
but, just to make sure, I replace it. Voila! No more distortion. Now it hits
me that I switched the fuses before I turned the thing on at the beginning.
There really was distortion on the left channel... I've never seen a fuse do
this before - acting just like a diode, but only when a load is present.

All that remained was to clean up 20+ years of dust and spiderwebs on the
inside, lube the pulleys for the tuning mechanism, and dig up some
replacement machine screws for mounting the chassis to the cabinet. The
cabinet looks like crap, but I'll deal with that later and do the reverb unit
cabinet at the same time. Now I've got the receiver set up in my shop, and it
really does look cool next to the reverb. The sound is excellent, and I have
to confess I like the look of the old analog radio dial. Best of all, all the
parts I needed were in my personal stash.

Postmortem/lessons learned: First, never change anything before the
preliminary evaluation. I would have saved a lot of time if I hadn't switched
the fuses around. Second, it would have also saved time to trace the entire
circuit first and find all the problems (like the fried components on the
small board) right away rather than the progressive look/replace/test process
I used.

@node 43 "Chapter 43) RCA FFR495 (CTC111C) Color TV Part 1: Messed up Colors"

Patient:
     My color television - the one I actually bought new (what a concept) at
     a discount store (after the yoke died on my Zenith B/W 21" tube set from
     the 1960s). The RCA was about 4 years old at the time of this failure.

Symptoms:
     At first, I just thought the camera work on the show I was watching was
     a little strange, maybe the lighting at dusk or something like that. But
     when the commercials also looked strange, it was obvious that the TV was
     the problem. There were no yellows or blues! All colors were in shades
     of red, orange, and cyan. This makes bananas look particularly icky.

Testing:
     I tried different channels, adjusting the user controls, etc. No change.
     Black and white programs were normal and turning the color control all
     the way down resulted in a normal B/W picture.

     Therefore, the CRT and its drive are fine, no missing colors. This is a
     case of messed up colors - and there can be only one small area of the
     TV's circuitry that can be responsible - the chroma decoder. I suppose,
     a short between two of the primary color signals - say blue and green -
     could result in a somewhat similar symptom but it was clear by rotating
     the tint control that this simple explanation did not hold up.

For a while, I just watched my weird TV since until I could get the Sams,
there would not be much I could do. After a couple days, it didn't seem as
strange but nonetheless, I didn't want to have to explain the situation to
anyone who visited. So, off to the library. This is a good excuse to copy
nearly the complete Sams folder for the CTC111 chassis even though a
relatively small area is involved (in this problem).

A single IC performs all the chroma functions including generation of the
3.58 MHz reference, gating of the color burst, I and Q decoding, and
generation of the R, G, and B drive to the CRT socket board. A
disconcertingly large number of discrete components surround this chip.

There are basically three signal inputs: luminance (B/W video), chrominance
(color information), and a color burst gating pulse.

Since the B/W picture is normal, the luminance input must be fine. There is
no likely scenario where a fault in a prior subsystem (i.e., tuner or IF)
could mess up the chrominance in any way that would explain the symptoms. The
gating pulse matches the Sams waveform.

What about voltage measurements? These seem to be pretty close though at
least one appears to be a misprint in the Sams (I never do quite figure out
if it is or not, it did not have anything to do with the problem but my
control settings might not have been the same).

What else is there? The output R, G, and B drives we know are messed up but
do they appear funny in any way? Nope, they are all unique and the amplitudes
are similar - thus no apparent shorts between them or to anywhere else.

The chip could be bad. Yes, I should have known better but this was over 10
years ago and ICs in TVs were relatively new. Therefore, I obtain a
replacement - $15, not too bad considering how many legs it has! I carefully
unsolder the old one and install a socket (as I always do in these situations
as damage to the cheaply made circuit boards is likely if it needs to be
changed again or the replacement is bad).

With great expectations, the new chip is plugged in, the TV is turned on and-

That looks even worse than before! Not only are the colors more messed up but
the contrast seems to be off as well. So, either the replacement is bad (yeh,
right) or the chip is not the problem. While bad parts are possible, the
symptoms looks suspiciously similar, if not quite identical. Therefore, I
conclude that it must be something else. $15 wasted? No, I learned a lot: If
the chip is good and the signals to it look good, there can only be one set
of alternatives - a bad discrete component or solder connection in the
vicinity of the chip.

Well, they all look like parts. No smoke has leaked out that I can see.

First, to determine which parts are likely to affect only the color. Based on
the controls (color and tint) and identifying parts that would have an effect
on phase or frequency response narrows it down quite a bit. There are some
resistors, capacitors, and a couple of small inductors.

A methodical test of resistances between pairs of nodes finally turns up
something. There is an inductor in what looks like a filter between two pins
on the chip which measures open! That would do it. It is marked 6 on the
schematic and that is probably the normal resistance - it certainly should
not test open. On the parts list, I finally find it - a 39 uH inductor. Just
as a quick test, I take a 1 M resistor and wind a very precise random number
of turns of #30 magnet wire around it. The 1M is irrelevant but acts as a
convenient form for the coil.

Now, finally, a change in the color. Nowhere near correct but this is the
first time that anything approaching reasonable colors have appeared since
the start of this affair. Still not quite right. I get a another 1M resistor
body and wind a whole bunch more turns onto it. Now, that is a lot better.
Actually, probably good enough but I have access to an inductance bridge at
work so, resistor and #30 wire in hand, I finally manage to come up with a
fair approximation to a39 uH inductor. Sure, you are saying, just go buy one.
You know that is not my style!

Comments: There is no good excuse for an inductor in a low power circuit to
fail. The only explanation can be that one of the connections to the outside
leads was not made properly or the fine wire of the coil had been nicked and
finally just broke. I attempted to repair it but unfortunately lost the wire
inside the potting compound (it was something like #40 wire - very very
thin).  Just bad quality control, not an induced failure.

Although it cost me $15 to replace the (good) chip, in the end, this was
probably well worth it as it definitively (well, almost) eliminated a large
unknown from consideration. The TV worked well for the next 12 years and only
recently developed the 'No Picture' problem to be dealt with in a subsequent
Repair Brief.

@node 44 "Chapter 44) Magnavox 4head HiFi VCR"

Author: Willis Chung
E-Mail: NikonKidF3@aol.com

Patient:
     Magnavox 4head HiFi VCR comes in with chief complaint that it won't load
     and eject tapes consistently.

Symptoms:
     A quick look inside with the cover off confirms this. The tape inside
     will partially elevate, but will not eject. The machine will also not
     play the tape, even when it appears that it is all the way down.

Testing:
     With gentle finger assistance, the rental tape is raised and ejected
     while the VCR is trying to eject it. A scratch tape is used to confirm
     that the problem is repeatable. An examination of the mechanism in the
     under-carraige shows a single toothed drive belt. No slipping here.

Thinking that the tape elevator mechanism was sticking, I clean and lubricate
the elevator assembly. Function does improve, but if a tape is loaded into
the machine after a few minutes of inactivity, the machine fails to load it
fully and fails to eject it. Once the tape is ejected with finger assistance,
subsequent loading usually resulted in correct function, with the machine
going into the half load position, and then playing properly.

Thinking that there was sonething mechanical that was sticking, I poked and
prodded at a lot of the mechanical parts, finding nothing wrong, nothing
sticking. Thinking it was a mode switch problem, I took the mode switch out,
disassembled it, and cleaned it thoroughly. Thinking the machine was not
sensing the position of the elevator mechanism, I disassembled and cleaned
the elevator position switches and verified their function. Naturally, none
of these things changed the behavior of the machine.

Stumped, I let the machine "season" on my bench for a few weeks. I fix some
other VCRs, and feel better about myself.

After posting the problem, I received several suggestions. #1 Check the
elevated pinch roller mechanism for binding. I had cleaned and lubed this
already, but I took a close look at it. No problems there. #2 Check the power
supply voltages.

Hooking up a scope to the outputs of the switch mode power supply shows
massive ripple on the +15 volt line. Aha! Tracking the line back, I find a
capacitor (470mfd, 16volts!). Soldering a 470mfd 35volt capacitor eliminates
the ripple, and the machine loads and ejects like a champ. Examination of the
other capacitors in the power supply reveals one more 16volt cap on a 15 volt
power supply line. I replace this one with a 35volt one as well. Seems like
the power supply was designed to fail prematurely.

@node 45 "Chapter 45) Panasonic PV1414 Closed Circuit TV Camera with no Video"

Patient
     A friend's brother's closed circuit TV camera from a building he rented
     (or something similarly convoluted).

Symptoms
     No video. Output will sync the small monitor that came with it but
     absolutely no signs of any response to light. You could set off a
     magnesium flare 2 inches in front of it - lens or no lens - and there
     would be no indication of any change to the video.

Testing
     There are no user adjustments beyond focus (there isn't even an iris on
     the lens). The camera was connected to a working monitor. Nothing,
     zippo, zilch, nadda.

This is a fairly typical 1/2" vidicon NTSC B/W video camera. 16 mm, f1.6 lens
with focus ring, 24 VAC power. Output is baseband (RS170) video from a BNC
jack. Apparently, it had been working but then at some point just quit. No
one knows if it was a sudden or gradual failure.

First, some vidicon theory:

A vidicon is one of a number of similar camera pickup tubes based on a non-
storage photoconductive target. An electron gun, not to dissimilar from the
one in a TV or monitor CRT generates a beam of electrons. A number of
electrodes shape and accelerate this beam toward the target. A pair of
magnetic deflection coils provide horizontal and vertical scanning exactly as
in a TV. A focus coil is used rather than focus electrodes (as are common in
modern CRTs).

The photoconductive target is high resistance when dark but low resistance
when illuminated. When the image from the lens is focused onto the target
coating, the light and dark areas of the image results in low and high
resistance areas on the target. As the electron beam scans, the target
current is a direct analog of the brightness variations of the image. A very
high impedance amplifier then boosts this signal to the level required for
RS170 video (roughly .7 V p-p into 75 ohms) which is combined with the
composite sync from the master timing generator.

Anyway, back to the story...

My friend Bill has quite a decently equipped lab related to his business
(special analog integrated circuits) but when it comes to something a bit out
of the ordinary, he is less than, shall we say, well prepared. To test this
camera on the bench requires a 24 VAC supply for its power. You would think
that locating a suitable transformer between a basement and garage full of
junk (sorry Bill, that is what a lot of it is!) would be a piece of cake.
Nope. We had to jerry-rig a couple of adjustable AC supplies in series to get
something approximating 24 V. Oops, phase backwards. Reverse and try again.
Finally, 24 VAC, and not too much smoke (though there was some - probably a
dead cockroach or something bigger). :-)

From the outset, Bill is insisting that the tube is bad. How? "Oh, the heater
will be gone". OK, where is the multimeter?

We use his 25 year old Lafayette VOM with the bent probes (one of which is
missing the banana plug at the multimeter end so the wire is just stuffed
into the hole). It is probably pins 3 and 4 of the vidicon. Yep, seems low
resistance to me. When the camera is powered, in the dark, it is indeed just
possible to make out the faint orange glow of the heater inside the tube but
this was not obvious at first. The voltage is probably correct, something
like 5 or 6 V DC.

Being the more conservative type, I suggest trying to trace out some of the
circuit to determine what's what.

Bill, on the other hand wants to start poking around with the scope. OK,
fine.  At least, many of the connector pins are labeled with signal names.
There are even various voltage test points on the circuit boards.

Well, first, let use check the marked voltages. Using the state-of-the-art
multimeter, every marked voltage seems to be dead on. (Now, don't get me
wrong. I also have an identical VOM which I still use quite a bit. However,
it is in somewhat less battle weary.)

Unfortunately, all the marked voltages are power supply outputs - not pins on
the vidicon tube which is what is really needed (as you will see later).

OK, what next. "Let's check deflection." Sure, humor him. These are clearly
marked on the yoke connector. On the scope, the vertical looks like a decent
sawtooth but the horizontal is a really short pulse. I, figuring the
inductance of the horizontal coil suggest that this might be normal. Bill
doesn't buy into this. I also suggest that even if the horizontal deflection
were dead, there would be some light sensitivity - the response is real time
with respect to wherever the beam is hitting. As long as it is somewhere on
the target, there should be some response to light. The horizontal deflection
coils are AC coupled - capacitor is good - so the beam could not be fully off
target. Bill is still fixated on a deflection problem. Oh well, humor him
some more.

At this point, it is late, I want to do this in my more methodical way, so I
bundle the whole thing into a bag and take it home on the back of my 10
speed.

Now, I do not have the nice working setup that Bill does, but I do have
parts. You want parts, I have parts. In particular, I have no trouble
locating a 24 V transformer and a line cord! So that problem, at least does
not exist at my place.

Since Bill won't sleep until this deflection thing can be put to bed also, I
decide to trace the circuit to see if the pulsed waveform is entirely
consistent with how it would appear to operate. I still believe it is and it
is irrelevant anyway.... The circuit is very conventional, not too unlike a
horizontal output circuit in any TV or monitor except that there is only an
inductor in place of the flyback. Checking the input signal, it is quite
clear that the circuit is doing what it should.

Then I get a phone call. Hi Bill. So we are discussing this result someone
mentions that it would be easy with a current probe to determine if the
deflection waveforms were correct. Current probe! Hello? Did someone mention
the words 'current probe' by an chance? Of course. I have a Tek high
frequency clamp on current probe - cost me a whole 10 cents at a garage sale.
The last time I used it, Bill and I were trying to measure the instantaneous
current pulse in an electronic flash unit (about 60-100 A). Why didn't we
think of this earlier (Bill has one as well but I bet he paid more for his!
Then again, with Bill, you can never quite tell).

This takes all of five minutes - the wires are clearly marked. And, what do
you know, a perfect current sawtooth! Hi Bill, guess what? Horizontal current
is a perfect sawtooth.

Next, I decide to attempt to figure out what each of the signals connected to
the vidicon do. There are 7 pins, the internal electrode arrangement is
clearly visible, and the names are printed on the vidicon socket board:


Pin 1: G1 ; Grid 1 - sets the beam current (like brightness, 0 to -80V).
Pin 2: K  ; Cathode - electron emitter.  (0 V, 20 V for blanking)
Pin 3: H+ ; Filament, around 5-6 V DC.
Pin 4: H- ;
Pin 5: G2 ; Grid 2 - this is very close to the cathode. (400 V) (1)
Pin 6: G3 : Grid 3 - this runs most of the length of the tube.  (300 V) (2)
Pin 7: G4 : Grid 4 - this is a short ring near the target. (400 V)

  1. This is suspicious as I would expect it to be somewhere in between G1
     and G3 in value. However, based on the circuit, this probably is correct
     as it is fed through a resistor (not voltage divider) directly from the
     400 V supply.

  2. This voltage seems to be the feedback for the power supply regulator.


   ____ _____________________

Target (Video signal out on external contact ring). Biased at around +10 V.

Touching or even going near the target ring at the front of the vidicon
results in a hum signal in the video output. Therefore, the video amplifier
chain is almost certainly working correctly.

Taking measurements while adjusting the Beam and Target pots seems to
indicate that they have the expected effect. There is just no beam current!

What else? Maybe Bill is right - the tube is shot.

I start rechecking the measurements - probe slips, zap - what was that? Did I
see a picture for a second or two? What did I touch? Figuring a cold solder
joint, I start prodding in the vicinity. Nothing. OK, recreate the incident.
The G2 test point and another pad are very close. If I momentarily touch the
two, there is a tiny spark and a faint but recognizable picture appears for a
few seconds and then fades out. This is entirely repeatable. What is that
other pad? It turns out to be G1 - the beam control grid. Surprise, surprise!

At first I thought that dragging down the G3 voltage or the +300 V rail was
having the effect but, of course, it turned out to be pulling up on the G1
voltage - making it more positive with respect to the cathode. In fact,
shorting G1 to its buddy next door on the same connector, +H, results in a
very nice picture. (Recall that +H is around +5 or +6 V).

For now, I will see if I can get it working consistently and worry about the
explanation later. I grab a 1 M resistor and solder it between +300 V and G1.
Now, it is possible to adjust Beam (and all the other controls I messed up)
to get a quite decent picture. The resistor provides enough positive current
into the BEAM pot so that the G1 voltage can easily be brought up to 30 V -
well beyond what is needed.

As far as I can tell, the video is fine, the settings are stable. So, we have
a case of a device that works in way it should not - which usually means that
the 'fix' is masking some other fault. Without schematics with voltage levels
or a spec sheet for the vidicon, there is not much more I can do. Bill will
no doubt want the thing back anyhow and it will be hard to refuse in the
interest of further research.

Comments: There are times when total comprehension is not required. It would
be a simple matter to substitute a known good vidicon - if I had one. There
is only so much time worth spending on something like a B/W CCTV camera.
Based on on my testing, it works reliably. I have had it on for several hours
without any change in behavior.

Almost certainly, there is still a fault - perhaps Bill was correct all along
and the vidicon is indeed bad in some way - not the way he thought, but bad
is bad except when it works! Or, maybe one of the voltages is indeed far
enough off to be killing the video. Maybe it will drift further out of spec
over time and the 'fix' will now longer be enough. For now, it works, move
on.  This camera will never be used in any mission-critical application,
probably chip inspection, so if it dies, Bill will just have to unpack the
Mark-1 magnifying eyeballs from storage.

Patient
     Heathkit 3-1/2 digit bench/portable digital multimeter from garage sale
     junk box. Apparently, this kit was never entirely completed as the cover
     was still in its protective plastic wrap.

Symptoms
     No display or any other signs of life. No smoke either so at least that
     is a positive sign.

Testing
     Switching through all ranges and modes results in similar behavior as in
     no signs of life.

Here is a situation that is not quite typical of a repair: a device which is
in a totally unknown state. Was it constructed properly? Were all the parts
good? Did some prior attempt to make it work blow something out? In many ways
it is much better to be working on a device that was functional and then blew
its top than to be dealing with something that never worked properly and
whose history is not available.

Well, with every long journey, start with a single step...

I don't intend to spend a lot of time on this. If initial tests do not
produce any revelations, shelve it. However, I do have the complete
instruction manual and schematics so this will not be a totally blind
challenge.

Since there is no action of any kind - not even a hint of a display - either
the power supply is bad or the controller - an MK6013 - is bad. Hope for the
power supply.

This meter is designed to be used on the bench or as a portable. It uses 4
C-size NiCd cells trickle charged when plugged into its detachable power
cord.  Checking on each of these indicates that they are charging. After a
few minutes, there is greater than 5 V across the battery which should be
adequate for normal operation. Still nothing. Unplugging, shows that the
cells (despite some crystallization around the ends) do hold a charge.

The power supply runs off of the NiCd battery and uses a DC-DC convertor to
generate all the voltages required for the circuitry except the +5 which is
obtained from the battery through a pass transistor. The neon 7 segment
displays require +/- 170 V and the analog circuitry uses +/-12 V. Listening
carefully, it is just possible to hear the whine of this DC-DC convertor so
at least it is starting up. Are the voltage outputs correct?

Well, the +170 testpoint measures about +70, the -170 V testpoint and +12 are
also low and -12. Humm, -12 is nearly non-existent.

Putting a scope on one of the inputs to the convertor transformer shows a
highly asymmetric waveform. This is a totally symmetric power oscillator.
Therefore, such a skewed waveform probably indicates excess load on one of
the outputs - probably on just one diode of the rectifier for that output.

Before I start mucking around in the power supply, I unplug the MK6013 chip
and set it aside in conductive foam. I don't really want to blow it out
(assuming it is still good) through some power supply screwup. All other
parts are common and readily available. I probably would never get around to
searching for a replacement for the MK6013, however.

First step: disconnect all windings of the transformer that are not needed to
run the convertor oscillator. Fortunately, this is easily accomplished
without removing the transformer. Suck the solder, make sure the pins are
clear of the pads. Power! OK, now the waveform is a nice squarewave (much
higher frequency and no longer audible). This proves that (1) the transformer
is likely fine and (2) it is an excessive secondary load problem.

Which output?

First, I reconnect the high voltage (+/-170 V) winding. Still a nice
squarewave. The +/- 170 V testpoints measure about 180 V and there is just a
hint of a glow from part of the display. Without logic drive, this could be
correct.

So, the problem is in the low voltage portion of the power supply or
somewhere else powered from the low voltage. Good news and bad news. This
narrows down the problem - to most of the circuitry in the entire unit!
However, the fault is likely in the power supply.

Next, reconnect the transformer winding for the +/-12. Now, the bad waveform
is back. The asymmetry of the input waveform almost certainly points to a bad
rectifier as this is the only component that could produce a load current
depending on the polarity of the input. Once rectified, excess load should
affect both polarities of the input waveform equally and thus not result in
the asymmetric waveform.

First, is it the positive or negative 12 V that is the problem? Pulling one
transistor easily confirms that the +12 V output is not the problem I then
unsolder each of the two rectifiers for the +12 V and nothing changes.

Now for the -12. Unsoldering D212 makes no difference but removing D214
restores the symmetry of the waveform. Even without this diode in place, all
output voltages are now well within expected tolerances. A 1N4007 takes the
place of its dead buddy.

Now for the acid test: replace the controller chip. And - Yes! - we have a
display. It even looks somewhat correct. Obviously, the meter has not been
calibrated but it does produce the expected results for DC V and Ohms. The +
indicator and a couple of segments are out but some quick jiggling and
tapping confirms bad connections. The bad segments are due to loose socket
pins and easily remedied with a pair of needlenose pliers. I never do
discover the actual cause of the bad + indicator but the problem went away
after cycling the AC/DC switch several times.

Some quick calibration shows that it is in pretty good condition. There may
possibly still be some minor accuracy problems with a couple of the ranges
but in general - the @$#% thing works!

A bad diode! A stupid, 5 cent, bad 1N4002 diode! Can you imagine the
frustration of the original owner who, after meticulously constructing the
kit - following every instruction to the letter, double checking and triple
checking - is unable to make it work because of a simple power supply
problem?  Keep in mind that this is not a modern DMM where the major parts
consist of: case, selector, IC, LCD. This is 1975 technology with many many
discrete parts on two 4" x 6" circuit boards. The effort probably represented
several dozen hours labor with a hot soldering iron and the extensive use of
choice 4 letter words.

Comments: A Heathkit IM2202 Multimeter is nothing to write home about by
today's standards but is still useful nontheless. The significance here, if
there is any, is in the type of situation in which one is attempting to make
a newly constructed unit operational. There are subtle differences in the
diagnostic procedures required due to the unknowns involved. In this
particular situation, there was no way of knowing how much damage might have
been done through prior unsuccessful troubleshooting or whether - as it
turned out - some original parts were bad as well. This was obviously not the
first electronics kit constructed by this person - there were a number of
successful examples at the same sale. Therefore, I did have some confidence
that the basic construction was solid and accurate and there would be some
minor problem involved - which as it turned out, was correct reasoning.

@node 47 "Chapter 47) SYLVANIA RXX170-WA01 Color TV Clicks - No Picture or Sound"

Patient
     Garage sale TV. Waited for price to be marked: $5. Paid $3. Then asked
     if there was remote - they wanted to charge me $30 for that! Just
     kidding.

Symptoms
     Pressing front panel power button results in a click but no indication
     of deflection or anything else. By listening carefully, it is just
     possible to determine that the 'on' and 'off' clicks are not quite the
     same sound. Therefore, the system controller thinks it is cycling power
     - this is not a shutdown problem. There is no response of any kind to
     any buttons on the remote control.

Testing
     With the cover off, the first check is to determine if the horizontal
     output transistor (HOT) is shorted - it is not. Applying power (using my
     isolation transformer), the main filter capacitor shows the expected
     +150 V from the bridge rectified 115 VAC. Shutting power off causes this
     voltage to decay over the course of about 10 seconds - therefore, the
     power relay, its control, and main filter capacitor are probably good.
     Checking voltage at the HOT shows that it is present (though high - I
     suspect this is simply due to the fact that there is no substantial load
     with the set not running). Thus, this is a startup problem and not a
     catastrophic failure of the HOT, flyback, or some other expensive part.
     More importantly, startup problems usually have a definite cause and are
     not likely to reoccur.

The next step is to obtain the Sams Photofact for this set. A trip to the
library is in order. Until then, what about the remote control? Is it bad or
is there something else in the TV itself that is not responding to the
remote?

A quick check with my IR Tester reveals that the remote is not putting out
any IR signal for any button presses. I double-check the batteries - they are
good and will operate other remote controls. Opening the remote control is
not as bad as some - one screw and some snaps along the sides. Nothing looks
immediately amiss - no broken parts. But this is the component side of the
circuit board. Depressing some catches around the edge allows it to be
removed. Hey, what is this? Along one edge, a trace has been lifted off and
broken by one of the catches. Did I do that? I thought I was being careful
enough. Well, it needs to be jumpered and soldered in any case. That does it!
The remote now puts out a strong IR signal - and operates the TV (to the
extent that this is possible - at least it clicks in exactly the same way). I
still have no idea of how the trace got broken or if I did it though this
would imply an impossible sequence of events as I did not open the remote
until *after* it did not work. But it did definitely fix the remote problem.
For good measure, I also put a dab of glue on the ceramic resonator which is
flapping in the breeze.

Now, back to the main event. Checking the Sams index is disappointing - this
model is not listed in the (1995) manual. However, a model with a very
similar number is. Well, asking for the folder doesn't cost anything.
Examining the schematics of this folder (for a RXX168-WA01) shows that there
are enough similarities to justify copying costs. In fact, it appears to be
virtually identical (I cannot actually locate any differences of any
consequence). Generally, on the first round, I copy the schematics and any
resistance charts and chip descriptions (block diagrams). Later, if I need
specific information like part numbers, I will copy the appropriate
additional pages.

Since there is voltage on the HOT, there is almost certainly a problem with
the startup drive. Checking the base of the HOT shows that there is no drive
present when power is turned on.

Checking the base of the horizontal driver transistor shows that there is
nothing there either.

How is startup drive derived?

Various models of TVs and monitors use different techniques: multivibrator,
deflection chip powered from standby supply, high value resistor supplies
current to horizontal driver or HOT directly, etc.

For this TV, a single chip is used for sync and deflection, a TDA8305 - TV
Signal Processor. However, after examining every pin on this chip, it is
apparent that there is no DC power available until after the set starts up
and the flyback supply is running. The supply voltages for the chip are all
13 V - rectified, filtered, and regulated off of a winding on the flyback.
This leaves only one possibility - there is a high value resistor between the
130 V B+ and the base of the horizontal driver transistor.

The collector of the horizontal driver transistor has the expected +130 V B+
so the transistor is not turning on or is open (not likely).

First, I unsolder the base of the horizontal driver transistor so I can check
the junctions with an ohmmeter - it appears good. Better make sure to
reconnect that before applying power or else there will be 130 V on the IC!

Next, I test across R502 - startup resistor. It injects current into the base
of the horizontal driver transistor. This applies a pulse to the HOT to
initiate the flyback supply. And, what do you know! The resistor tests open!
At first I thought I was just using the wrong scale on my VOM. However, it is
indeed open - might as well be a pair of disconnected wires. It is a 47 K ohm
1/2 W film resistor. A quick power calculation shows that 130 V across a 47 K
ohm resistor is about .3 W - close enough to suspect that simple heat
dissipation and thermal cycling over time resulted in an isolated failure. In
fact, there is no possible mechanism that would result in a forced failure of
this resistor. Even if the 130 V supply was running high, the maximum
dissipation is just about 1/2 W.

A replacement - with a 1 W resistor this time - restores normal operation.
Not a bad set for $3 (+$2.40 in copying costs and a resistor).

Comments: These are the types of repairs that pay the rent for repair shops.
A quickly identified cause with an equally quick and definitive cure. A
return problem related to this repair is extremely unlikely. Realistically, a
15 minute repair from start to finish is possible.

This Sylvania TV is also nice to work on. Everything is on one circuit board,
components are clearly marked, and it is possible to access everything
without disconnecting more than the degauss and speaker connections (not
needed for testing in any case). Too bad that a 2 cent resistor was specified
with a marginal power rating. All too frequently, startup problems in TVs,
monitors, and other switchmode power supplies, are caused by open high value
resistors.

@node 48 "Chapter 48) Kenwood CD Changer with erratic behavior"

Patient
     Kenwood carrousel 5 disc CD changer. This is an 'everything in a drawer'
     type design.

Symptoms
     Sometimes, it will recognize the disc and start playing. Most of the
     time, it will give up and go on to the next slot.

Testing
     Several discs were tried without any conclusive differences in behavior.
     If a disc is successfully recognized, it will play without problems
     until about the midpoint and then the player will abort and move on to
     the next. Attempting to manually search forward past track 6 (on one
     particular disc being used for tests) will result in an abort as well.

Unfortunately, once a disc is rejected, the silly thing remembers that the
spot (1 of 5) is empty so without cycling power, it is not possible to even
attempt to play the same disc twice in succession.

However, this is a minor irritation.

The first problem was getting the case open. While the screws appeared to be
ordinary Philips head screws, it required almost sitting on the screwdriver
to persuade them to break free. Hope he never expects to have any warranty
work done. The heads are barely recognizable!

Once open, the disc in the play slot is clearly visible. When the player
fails to recognize a disc, it doesn't spin at all. Ha! a spindle motor
problem. (Rubbing my hands!)

But first, check out startup. With suitable contortions, it is just possible
to make out the edge of the lens with no disc in place. Pressing play results
in the expected behavior of the lens moving up and down several times before
giving up (with no CD present).

There is no chance of being able to see the lens with a disc in place. Forget
it.

Well, maybe it is the spindle motor. I put a disc in and press play. Disc
moves into position, pause, give up and move on.

I'll show it!

Cycle power. Press play. Disc moves into position. And -- now: give the disc
a little twist. Yes! now the CD picks up speed and is recognized and starts
playing.

Hummmm.

Sounds more and more like a spindle motor. Perhaps a dead spot or partially
shorted winding. Or maybe a weak driver. Is this consistent? For the most
part, it is. Sometimes, the disc will be recognized and will play on its own
but most of the time, a little help is needed. Once it starts, a dead spot
would not matter and the hardest time for a driver is when the motor is
starting.

However, what about the problem of not being able to play to the end of a
disc once play is successful? I confirm that this is still indeed the case.
Yes, it is impossible to play past track 6 on this particular disc. Trying
another one, there is a also a time location beyond which play aborts.

What does this mean? It now doesn't sound like the motor as the toughest job
for the spindle motor is at the start of a disc.

However, what else could it be?

So, I roll up my sleeves and prepare to do battle with the spindle motor, at
least testing it. This is not going to be fun. The spindle motor is located
underneath the pullout drawer and there doesn't appear to be any easy access.
Well, every long journey begins with a single step....

As I am removing the bar with the clamper above the optical deck, something
catches my eye. What was that? This is the first unobstructed view of the
lens. That doesn't look quite right. Normally, the lens of a CD player or
other optical drive is shiny with a bluish tinge. This one is fuzzy purple.
That can't be right. Well, cleaning is easy enough not believing (but hoping)
that a dirty lens could be the problem all along.

One Q-tip later and, yes, all the former problems disappear. Discs are
recognized reliably, play flawlessly and to the end, and search works fine
for the entire disc.

How could a dirty lens prevent the spindle from starting but then play
apparently normally until a certain track? Well, I never actually did confirm
that focus was established in the situations where the player gave up. But to
have problems with focus but then be able to play substantially free of
problems. Well, no one ever said that understanding was always guaranteed.

When discussing the results with the owner, he confirmed that the house was
somewhat dusty but I know that no one in his family smokes and the player was
not in a kitchen.

Oh well, at least I did not have to take the whole bloody thing (the owner is
an Englishman) to pieces.

Comments: Why am I reporting on a simple case of a CD player that required a
lens cleaning? Well, to point out that many problems really do have simple
solutions even if the initial symptoms may point elsewhere.

In a portable, cleaning the lens would have been done as a matter of course
due to the easy access. Cleaning the lens in this changer meant removing the
cover as well as the bar holding the clamper. And, some of the symptoms did
not really point to lens cleaning.

@node 49 "Chapter 49) RCA EFR485 (CTC111) Color TV Part 2: No Picture"

Patient
     My color television - the one I actually bought new (what a concept) at
     a discount store (after the yoke died on my Zenith B/W 21" tube set of
     many years. This is the second of a 2 part Repair Briefs.

Symptoms
     I turned it on and - sound but no picture. No light visible on the
     screen. That is kind of strange. Except for the color problem 10 years
     ago, this has been a reliable set. (No tuner shield solder problems,
     knock on plastic!)

Testing
     No user controls have any effect. The screen remains black. There is no
     flash of light when powering it off either. There is static on the
     screen however, so I suspect that HV is fine. Nothing is shutting down
     on its own either.

Since there is sound and HV static, I assume the horizontal deflection is
running. As a simple test, I turn up the SCREEN control. This results in a
raster. Therefore the power supplies, horizontal, vertical, high voltage,
tuner, and sound are all in fine shape. Just no #$%^ picture. Well, that
narrows the area of search considerably.

This will require the Sams and a scope to trace - sure, no problem. I still
have the photocopied Sams from dealing with the previous problem and my scope
is just dying to chomp on something interesting.

The only difficulty is that the bottom of the main circuit board is not
accessible when mounted in the cabinet. However, maybe RCA thought of this -
there are two offset screw holes which (whether by design or not, I do not
know) permit the circuit board to be moved about 8 inches to the rear - and
the cabling is even long enough. Now, with the TV on its side, everything I
need to get to is out in the open.

With my isolation transformer - always a prerequisite - I can conveniently
examine various points in the video chain. However, some testpoints are
concealed under a shield soldered at multiple points. A slight annoyance -
the soldering on this shield is really really good.

Just when I have settled in to try to determine where the video signal is
getting lost, the picture pops on. Actually, it kind of dribbles on - first a
weak rainbow pattern and then a second later the good picture. Could this be
a bad connection? Perhaps, but no amount of wiggling, jiggling, whacking, or
cursing, has the slightest effect. Cycling power also does not induce the
problem. It is now as though the TV is not broken.

Hmmm. sounds like an electrolytic cap or thermal problem. (BTW, Bill - from
Repair Brief 35: "Panasonic PV1414 Closed Circuit TV Camera with no Video" is
sure that the problem is a bad electrolytic cap and wants to destroy the
ozone layer with a can of CFC based freeze spray to locate it.)

Let it cool for an hour.....

One hour later - picture comes on instantly!

Let it cool for a day.......

One day later - picture comes on instantly!

Leave it alone for a week................

Finally - no picture - for about a minute, then rainbow, then solid picture.

So, how does one go about troubleshooting a problem of this sort? Give me a
problem that takes a minute or hour to show itself any day but one that is
broken for only a minute or two? Not fun.

Well, perhaps even when it is working, there will be some voltage or waveform
that isn't quite right. Maybe a visual examination will turn up some
potentially bad electrolytic capacitors. Maybe one has lost some of its value
and a capacitance check will reveal the culprit. Right, keep dreaming.

First step: narrow down the search area. At this point, I have no idea
exactly where the video signal is getting lost - not even which subsystem! I
do know that sync is stable - examining the raster shows that the lines are
correctly interlaced when a proper channel is tuned. So, this puts it after
the sync separator. Since this is fed from the video at the output of the
video IF, I know at least that it is functioning to this point. That leaves
the entire luminance channel - joy - as well as the chroma/luminance IC (the
one I tried replacing in Part 1 of this story, U700).

I spend some time down one blind alley - the chroma input to U700. Suspecting
this signal, I confirm that it is indeed always present even when there is no
picture. A simple test of shorting this signal to ground at the chip input
would have revealed that the most its absence would do is result in a B/W
picture. One dead end.

Here is a rough block diagram of the video chain:


V                       +--------------+
i                 +-----| Lum Peak/Amp |-------+

Vertical Deflection  --| Vertical Blank |------+
                       +----------------+

I know that the video signal is fine at TP-A at all times. I also know now
that TP-B is fine and does not kill the video in any case should it
disappear.

Next, I identify the pins on the Lum/Chroma Proc chip (U700) that can
possibly kill the picture totally. It appears as though there are only five:
4 of these are controls or power supply voltages (constant DC levels) and the
other one is the luminance input, TP-C.

One week, later, preparing for battle I am set to measure the 4 static
voltages as soon as power is applied. The scope is hanging on TP-C as well to
determine if that signal is present at all times. A signal here would
eliminate all the stuff in the 'Lum Peak/Amp' box from consideration (and
there is considerable stuff in this box - I have greatly simplified the block
diagram).

Charge!, or, err, power!

Voltages: Measure, measure, measure, measure! These all check out within 5
percent or so.

TP-C signal: Yep, it comes up immediately and appears to be valid video and
of proper amplitude.

There is no detectable change in any of these when the picture appears 30
seconds later.

That's just great. All five possibilities seem to be fine. Well, when the
plausible are eliminated, check the implausible.

First, however, I breakdown and decide to swap U700 with my spare in a week
when I apply power again. As expected (but hoped against), the screen remains
black for the expected minute. When the picture appears, the color balance is
somewhat off (recall, that in our last episode, there were more severe
problems with this chip but that was when the actual fault had not been
located). However, adjustment of the CRT drives fixes this. For all intents
and purposes, the replacement U700 performs identically to the original.

So, there must be some other input to U700 that is messed up.

Well, there is another possible candidate. I had not paid serious attention
to it before but it is all that is left - the signal derived from 'Burst
Gate' and 'Vertical Blank'. I initially discounted this since there was a
signal present even when the picture was blank - but was it the correct
signal? Brief checks previously had shown it to healthy - but that was when
there was a picture.

One way to find out: short it to ground and see what happens. And - yes -
this kills the picture. What is also significant, is that when the short is
removed, the picture comes back in a very similar way to when the 'problem'
goes away - some initial rainbow effects before it stabilizes. So, next power
cycle (1 week) I am intent on catching this signal in the act! This signal
should look like a 2 volt pedestal during horizontal blanking with a narrow 5
volt pulse riding on top. This is called the 'Sandcastle'. I am now
thoroughly familiar with what the correct shape should be.


                             ___
               |\             ^
               ||             |
             __||_           7V
    ________|     |_________ _v_

1 Week passes......

Scope, are you ready? "At your service".

Look at that! The pedestal is there but the narrow pulse is missing. Finally
a clue. Some quick voltage measurements of the 'Vertical Blank' circuitry
shows that it is impossible for it to be at fault as the pedestal would not
appear normal. Therefore, it must be the 'Burst Gate'.

This is a fairly simple circuit - a transistor buffer is driven into
saturation by the inverse blanking signal. An RC delays its turnoff at which
point the positive going pulse at the collector is coupled via a C-L-R
network via a diode to U700. The following is somewhat simplified:


                            12V
                             |

                      _|_  |\         C L703    \ R741 
                 C709 ---    |        C         /
                      _|_   _|_      _|_       _|_
                       -     -        -         -

Next step: to determine if this transistor is working correctly. This time,
scope probes on input and output. The verdict: input and output are both
stable instantly at power-on. Having confirmed this, I immediately kill
power.  Maybe these quick checks will permit whatever is being cured in a
minute to remain sick. Now what?

What about the other side of C710. Nothing. How can that be?

Coupling capacitor? Quickly bridging another one doesn't result in any
change.  Kill power. I cannot afford the bench space, need to get this
wrapped up!

On a hunch, I check the resistance across L703. 20 K ohms, Huh? No way, it is
marked 21 ohms on the schematic. Not another dud inductor! (Recall that this
was the problem in Part I - messed up colors).

I pull L703 - it measures open. How could an open inductor result in a
flat-line output? One might think this would increase the output. Well, with
the inductor removed or open, the diode charges the capacitor as it would in
a power supply and results in the diode output being clamped to zero volts.
It actually makes sense.

First I try winding an inductor but even with as many turns of #32 wire as I
can fit on a 1/2 watt resistor body, the value must be way too low as the
output is still dead.

Rummaging around in my inductor drawer, I locate one that looks kind of
similar. Unmarked, but of approximately the right size and construction (I
really don't have a great stock of inductors.) The original is marked 471
which I assume to be 470 uH but I didn't photocopy the page of the Sams
Photofact with inductor ratings, unfortunately. The results with my unmarked
replacement are mixed - the picture is there (well, that really doesn't prove
anything) but it seems a little bright. This signal looks fine, maybe the
bright picture is my imagination. OK, try a different larger one. This even
measures the same on my ohmmeter as the original should (like that means
anything). However, the picture now appears normal.

Since the poor lonely inductor sitting on my bench still measures infinity
ohms, I am confident that this is indeed the problem. Exactly what mechanism
results in a delayed start inductor is not quite clear. It is not heat as
there is no time for any thermal effects and the power dissipation in the
inductor is about as close to zero as one can imagine. Is it simply the
voltage pulses appearing across some kind of marginal semiconductor-like
junction formed by corrosion between the coil wire and the leads that
eventually results in good contact?

Attempting to 'disassemble' the broken inductor simply results in broken
inductor pieces everywhere so I will never really know for sure what happened
- until another one of the half dozen or so similar inductors in the TV
decides to do its open circuit thing.

Maybe someday I will actually order the correct replacements for both of the
dud inductors - this new unmarked one and the homemade inductor that fixed
the previous messed up color problem. For now, it seems to be fine and the TV
shows won't be any better with the proper replacement parts anyhow.

Comments: No doubt next time (sure, if there is a next time) I will test all
the similar inductors first! What could possibly lead to a batch of
unreliable inductors is another one of those mysteries of the universe. After
all, an inductor is just a coil of wire soldered to a couple of leads. There
is no thermal or mechanical shock and the circuit is very low power in any
case. The TV is not in a damp location or subject to any other kind of abuse
that I know of though based on the appearance of the innards of the inductor,
some type of deterioration may have taken place.

How should one diagnose a problem of this type? In hindsight, I guess testing
components in the vicinity of the Lum/Chroma Proc after waiting a week and
with power off would make sense. But, some of the elapsed time was required
to localize the problem to that chip. However, once it was clear that one of
the signals to U700 was messed up, the ohmmeter checks would have greatly
reduced the additional required debug time. Would freeze spray have worked?
Perhaps - if anyone had thought to hit the inductor. There were no
electrolytic capacitors anywhere in the circuitry around U700.

@node 50 "Chapter 50) Sony Compact Stereo Model HP-179P - FM Dead"

Patient
     Sony compact stereo system - AM/FM radio, turntable, cassette (at least
     it is not an 8-track!!!). This is one of my charity repairs. (actually
     not charity in this case but low income people who would otherwise not
     get the stuff repaired at all.)

Symptoms
     AM works fine but there is only low level static from FM. General
     whacking and prodding produces no reaction.

Testing
     Exercised all buttons and controls, no change. An antenna seems to make
     little difference.

Getting to the **top** of the tuner circuit board is not too bad - just
remove the turntable, uh, record changer (you know what they are, right?).
Four screws and disconnect the motor and audio connectors.

However, even before that, I have to vacuum the thing! Why? Apparently, in
packing it up (in a pillowcase, no less), some powdered laundry detergent or
something similar was spilled into the thing. Yes, the adventures I have!
Even my shop vac has difficulty getting every last particle out but for now,
it will have to do.

With the turntable removed and set aside, the tuner and preamp board is
readily accessible.

The FM tuning capacitor and front end are easily identified. Touching various
points in this circuitry results in a large change in output but no
selectivity. There appears to be a strong station which peaks around 102 MHz
but it is obvious there is no heterodyning action as there is absolutely no
selectivity. However, the front end is sensitive to my touch and therefore it
is likely that the following stages are good.

I was just about to give up and head for the library and possible Sams when I
decided to poke around a little more. My some quirk, I happened to press on a
coil in the front end box and instantly good reception returned - as long as
I kept my finger on that coil! Another bad connection? A wooden stick worked
just as well as my finger (I was sure relieved since I didn't look forward to
spending the rest of my existence holding onto that coil). So, probably a bad
connection. When operating, reception seems to be absolutely perfect. Most
probably the local oscillator was at fault.

Now, the fun begins.

Getting to the bottom of the circuit board is a whole lot more difficult than
getting to the top.

First, the back panel needs to be removed. Then several screws holding the
circuit board and a ground strap that needs to be unsoldered from a shield.
Now it may be moved, but is still attached to the front panel via the dial
cord. And you know how much I love to restring dial cords! For a while, I
thought the cord would stay put even when pivoting the circuit board up
enough to inspect and resolder but no such luck. With a thoroughly
disheartening 'pling' the dial cord popped off of its pulleys. Well, at least
the board is totally free and the bottom can be accessed.

I resolder all the pads in the vicinity of the coil since may of the
connections looked questionable (though there were really none that I could
say definitively were bad).

After flipping the board back over, reception now appears to be solid.
Pressing, prodding, and pounding have no effect. Will it be permanent? I
surely hope so!

Replacing the dial cord turns out to be easier than I had expected (unlike
that time where I melted it with my soldering iron!) The only question was
how many turns on the tuning knob shaft but there is obviously only one
possibility (3) based on the total length.

Checking out the rest of the unit:

The tape deck appears to be functioning, Fortunately, none of the soap powder
made its way into the tape mechanism.

The turntable, however, is a sad story. Soap powder everywhere. I remove the
platter to find - more soap powder everywhere. It is necessary to
disassemble, clean, and regrease the main platter bearing and changer gears.

Only then do I notice that the counterbalance weight for the tone arm is
missing and the stylus is bent and would need to be replaced. Checking with
the owner, it turns out that she doesn't play records (I can see why) and
therefore, as much as it pains me, I will not bother to restore the turntable
at this time (and probably never). It would be simple - I would have to come
up with a suitable substitute for the weight and order a stylus.

Finally, I check out the dial indicators. One is burned out and another is
intermittent (broken filament). The stereo light is burned out as well. These
will come from MCM. At first I thought that substituting light bulbs I had in
my stock would suffice but the cost of the proper replacements was so low
that it wouldn't be worth it and mine would not work as well.

Comments: The world it seems is full of these 25 year old compact stereo
systems. While audiophiles and snobs may look down their noses at them, the
majority of people are perfectly happy with their performance (or lack
thereof). Repairing one of these may not have the glamor of working on a
laserdisc or projection TV but this lack may be more than made up for by the
flood of enthusiastic appreciation from the owner - especially if they would
otherwise not have been able to afford a repair.

Problems with compact stereos are very often low tech - lubrication, dirt,
bad connections, dried up capacitors, burnt out light bulbs. A schematic is
rarely needed and access to the interior is usually straightforward (though
perhaps not as easy as one would expect as in this case).

@node 51 "Chapter 51) Mitsubishi HS-U53 - Bad Tracking"

Patient
     My Mitsubishi HS-U53 HiFi VCR purchased new in 1990 (yes, hard to
     believe I actually bought something new!). Pampered, used mostly to tape
     Startrek and NOVA episodes. Not abused at all. How can it do this to me?

Symptoms
     Tape is accepted but attempting to play or even display a still results
     in a garbage picture - tracking is way off. In addition, play results in
     no tape movement and eject follows as if the VCR finds the content
     distasteful.

Testing
     I tried several tapes but it was obvious that something was very wrong.

I enjoy the challenge of reviving a garage sale acquisition purchased for $1
but I really do not like having to fix something for which I paid real money!

Nonetheless, I have no choice. Actually, this VCR has always been a bit
finicky about how a tape is inserted. If pushed into the cassette slot too
slowly, it might grab the tape and spit it out. If the tape was accepted,
there was a chance that it would not seat correctly and never advance.
Therefore, I wasn't entirely surprised by the failure.

Despite all my advise about most problems being simple and mechanical, I was
naturally thinking that **my** problem would be something esoteric!

Once the cover is off, the extent of the problem can be seen. This VCR uses a
'rapid access transport' which means that the tape is immediately wrapped
around the video heads in the fully loaded position except that the pinch
roller may not be fully engaged. Starting from this position is indeed quite
fast - less than a second to enter play or any other mode except super fast
rewind which unloads the tape back into the cassette. The tape is in very
light contact with the spinning drum but with no tension applied - which
winds down on its own after a few minutes to conserve motor life (wear of the
video heads would be negligible in this state).

Anyhow, back to the story. Checking the tape position after loading reveals
that the pinch roller is not moving properly over and down as it should.
Further close examination reveals the reason: there should be two wings on a
spiral plastic cam gear which guides the pinch roller movement. One of these
has apparently broken off allowing it to lose contact with its mate. (I did
find the broken-off piece - I really like to account for all parts so they
cannot jam something at a later time.)

Fortunately, MCM Electronics has a repair kit for about $12 which includes
the entire assembly with a new pinch roller as well as one belt. I guess this
is a common problem. Inspecting the pinch roller reveals some fine cracks
(somewhat unusual for a pinch roller of this age) so a replacement is
worthwhile.

To be safe, I scribe timing marks on the 2 or 3 gears that might be disturbed
during the swap. This is always a wise precaution if no service manual is
available. As it turned out, this was not needed as the new pinch roller
assembly dropped right in without moving anything.

Comments: Why does this sort of thing happen? Originally I thought that
Mitsubishi saved 2 cents on the plastic reinforcements and thus timed it to
fail after 4 years. Perhaps this is the case. However, the consensus now
appears to be that the lubrication of the shaft on which the pinch roller
assembly slides gums up or dries out resulting in binding and subsequent
breakage.

In either case, the end result is an annoying repair.

I did make sure to liberally lubricate the sliding shaft but fully expect the
problem to reoccur in a few years. Now, if I only would do the types of
preventive maintenance I recommend to others perhaps this could be avoided!
