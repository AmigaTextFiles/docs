@node 2.1 "Television at the crossroads"

Television in substantially its present form has been with us for nearly 50
years. It is a tribute to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC)
that the color television standards agreed upon in the early 1950s have
performed remarkably well making quite efficient use of valuable radio
spectrum space and the psychovisual characteristics of the human eye-brain
system. However, HDTV (High Definition TV) will supplant and ultimately
replace the current standards. We will all come to expect its superior
resolution, freedom from noise and ghosting, and CD sound. Yet, the perceived
quality of TV broadcasts and cable will never likely be the major issue with
most consumers. Content will continue to be the biggest problem.

It is likely that in roughly 15 years, HDTV - digitally processed and
transmitted as 1s and 0s - will completely replace the current system.
Acceptance in the marketplace is by no means assured but with the merging of
TV and computers - with the Internet as a driving force - it would seem that
the days of the stand-alone analog TV set are numbered.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.2 "Television receiver fundamentals"

The basic color television receiver must perform the same functions today as
40 years ago. (Since B/W is a subset of the color standard, most references
in this document will be for color except as noted). A studio video monitor
includes all of the functions of a television receiver except the tuner and
IF (which rarely fail except for bad connections or perhaps lightening
strikes to the antenna or cable connection). Therefore most of the repair
information in this document is applicable to both TVs and studio monitors.
Modern computer monitors share many similarities with TVs but the multisync
and high scan rate deflection circuitry and more sophisticated power supplies
complicates their servicing.

As of this writing, all but the smallest TVs are based on the Cathode Ray
Tube (CRT) as the display device. Tiny pocket sets, camcorder viewfinders,
and the like have started using LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) panels but these
are still inferior to the CRT for real time video. There has always been talk
of 'the picture on the wall' display. While we are closer than ever to this
possibility, I believe that mass production of an affordable wall mural TV
screen is still decades away. The reason is simple economics - it is really
hard to beat the simplicity of the shadowmask CRT. For example, a decent
quality active matrix color LCD panel may add $1000 to the cost of a notebook
computer compared to $200 for a VGA monitor. More of these panels go in the
dumpster than make it to product do to manufacturing imperfections.

Projection - large screen - TVs may, on the other hand, be able to take
advantage of a novel development in integrated micromachining - the Texas
Instruments Inc. Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). This is basically an
integrated circuit with a tiltable micromirror for each pixel fabricated on
top of a static memory - RAM - cell. This technology would permit nearly any
size projection display to be produced and would therefore be applicable to
HDTV. Since it is a reflective device, the light source can be as bright as
needed. However, this is still not a commercial product but stay tuned.

@node 2.3 "TV repair"

Unlike VCRs or CD players where any disasters are likely to only affect your
pocketbook, TVs can be dangerous. Read, understand, and follow the set of
safety guidelines provided later in this section whenever working on TVs,
monitors, or other similar high voltage equipment.

If you do go inside, beware: line voltage (on large caps) and high voltage
(on CRT) for long after the plug is pulled. There is the added danger of CRT
implosion for carelessly dropped tools and often sharp sheetmetal shields
which can injure if you should have a reflex reaction upon touching something
you should not touch. In inside of a TV or monitor is no place for the
careless or naive.

Having said that, a basic knowledge of how a TV set works and what can go
wrong can be of great value even if you do not attempt the repair yourself.
It will enable you to intelligently deal with the service technician. You
will be more likely to be able to recognize if you are being taken for a ride
by a dishonest or just plain incompetent repair center. For example, a faulty
picture tube CANNOT be the cause of a color television only displaying shows
in black-and-white. The majority of consumers probably do not know even this
simple fact. Such a problem is usually due to a bad capacitor or other 10
cent part.

This document will provide you with the knowledge to deal with a large
percentage of the problems you are likely to encounter with your TVs. It will
enable you to diagnose problems and in many cases, correct them as well. With
minor exceptions, specific manufacturers and models will not be covered as
there are so many variations that such a treatment would require a huge and
very detailed text. Rather, the most common problems will be addressed and
enough basic principles of operation will be provided to enable you to narrow
the problem down and likely determine a course of action for repair. In many
cases, you will be able to do what is required for a fraction of the cost
that would be charged by a repair center.

Should you still not be able to find a solution, you will have learned a
great deal and be able to ask appropriate questions and supply relevant
information if you decide to post to sci.electronics.repair. It will also be
easier to do further research using a repair text such as the ones listed at
the end of this document. In any case, you will have the satisfaction of
knowing you did as much as you could before taking it in for professional
repair. With your new-found knowledge, you will have the upper hand and will
not easily be snowed by a dishonest or incompetent technician.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.4 "Repair or replace"

If you need to send or take the TV to a service center, the repair could
easily exceed half the cost of a new TV. Service centers may charge up to $50
or more for providing an initial estimate of repair costs but this will
usually be credited toward the total cost of the repair (of course, they may
just jack this up to compensate for their bench time).

TV prices have been dropping almost as fast as PC prices. Therefore, paying
such prices for repair just may not make sense. Except for picture tube
problems, most TV faults can be corrected without expensive parts, however.
Keeping a 5 year old TV alive may be well worthwhile as basic TV performance
and important features have not changed in a long time.

If you can do the repairs yourself, the equation changes dramatically as your
parts costs will be 1/2 to 1/4 of what a professional will charge and of
course your time is free. The educational aspects may also be appealing. You
will learn a lot in the process. Thus, it may make sense to repair that old
clunker for your game room or beach house. (I would suggest the kid's room
but most TV watching just rots the brain anyhow so a broken TV may be more
worthwhile educationally than one that works.)

@node 3 "Chapter 3) TV Receivers 101"

3.1) Subsystems of a television set

A TV set includes the following functional blocks:

  1. Low voltage power supply (some may also be part of (2)). Most of the
     lower voltages used in the TV may be derived from the horizontal
     deflection circuits. Sometimes, there is a separate switching power
     supply but this would be the exception. Rectifier/filter
     capacitor/regulator from AC line provides the B+ to the switching power
     supply or horizontal deflection system. Degauss operates off of the line
     whenever power is turned on (after having been off for a few minutes) to
     demagnetize the CRT.

  2. Horizontal deflection. These circuits provide the waveforms needed to
     sweep the electron beam in the CRT across and back some 15,734 times per
     second (for NTSC). The horizontal sync pulse from the sync separator
     locks the horizontal deflection to the video signal.

  3. Vertical deflection. These circuits provide the waveforms needed to
     sweep the electron beam in the CRT from top to bottom and back 60 times
     per second (for NTSC). The vertical sync pulse from the sync separator
     locks the vertical deflection to the video signal.

  4. CRT high voltage (also part of (2)). A modern color CRT requires up to
     30 KV for a crisp bright picture. Rather than having a totally separate
     power supply, nearly every TV on the planet derives the HV (as well as
     many other voltages) from the horizontal deflection using a special
     transformer called a 'flyback' or 'Line OutPut Transformer (LOPT) for
     those of you on the other side of the lake.

  5. Tuner, IF, AGC, video and audio demodulators. Input is the antenna or
     cable signal and output are baseband video and audio signals. There is
     usually someplace inside the TV where line level video and audio are
     present but it may not be accessible from the outside of the cabinet
     unless you paid for the more expensive model with the A/V option. Very
     often, the tuner is a shielded metal box positioned on the bottom right
     (as viewed from the front) separate from the main circuit board.
     Sometimes it is on the main circuit board. The IF section may be in
     either place.

     On older or cheap TVs with a knob tuner, this is usually mounted to the
     front panel by itself. There are usually separate boxes for the VHF and
     UHF tuners.

  6. Chroma demodulator. Input is the baseband video signal. Outputs are the
     individual signals for the red, green, and blue video to the CRT.

  7. Video drivers (RGB). These are almost always located on a little circuit
     board plugged directly onto the neck of the CRT. They boost the output
     of the chroma demodulator to the hundred volts or so needed to drive the
     cathodes of the CRT.

  8. Sync separator. Input is baseband video. Output is horizontal and
     vertical sync pulses to control the deflection circuits.

  9. Audio amplifier/output. The line level audio is amplified to drive a set
     of speakers. If this is a stereo TV, then these circuits must also
     perform the stereo demultiplexing.

 10. System control. Most modern TVs actually use a microcontroller - a fixed
     program microcomputer to perform all user interface and control
     functions from the front panel and remote control. These are becoming
     increasingly sophisticated. However, they do not fail often. Older TVs
     use a bunch of knobs and switches and these are prone to wear and dirt.

Most problems occur in the horizontal deflection and power supply sections.
These run at relatively high power levels and some components run hot. The
high voltage section is prone to breakdown and arcing as a result of hairline
cracks, humidity, dirt, etc.

The tuner components are usually quite reliable unless the antenna
experiences a lightening strike. However, it seems that even after 20+ years
of solid state TVs, manufacturers still cannot reliably solder the tuner
connectors and shields so that bad solder connections in these areas are
common even in new sets.

@endnode
@node 4.1 "Color CRTs, Shadowmasks, Magnetic Fields, and Degauss"

All color CRTs utilize a shadowmask or aperture grill a fraction of an inch
(1/2" typical) behind the phosphor screen to direct the electron beams for
the red, green, and blue video signals to the proper phosphor dots. Since the
electron beams for the R, G, and B phosphors originate from slightly
different positions (individual electron guns for each) and thus arrive at
slightly different angles, only the proper phosphors are excited when the
purity is properly adjusted and the necessary magnetic field free region is
maintained inside the CRT. Note that purity determines that the correct video
signal excites the proper color while convergence determines the geometric
alignment of the 3 colors. Both are affected by magnetic fields. Bad purity
results in mottled or incorrect colors. Bad convergence results in color
fringing at edges of characters or graphics.

The shadowmask consists of a thin steel or InVar (a ferrous alloy) with a
fine array of holes - one for each trio of phosphor dots - positioned about
1/2 inch behind the surface of the phosphor screen. With most CRTs, the
phosphors are arranged in triangular formations called triads with each of
the color dots at the apex of the triangle. With many TVs and some monitors,
they are arranged as vertical slots with the phosphors for the 3 colors next
to one another.

An aperture grille, used exclusively in Sony Trinitrons (and now their clones
as well), replaces the shadowmask with an array of finely tensioned vertical
wires. Along with other characteristics of the aperture grille approach, this
permits a somewhat higher possible brightness to be achieved and is more
immune to other problems like line induced moire and purity changes due to
local heating causing distortion of the shadowmask.

However, there are some disadvantages of the aperture grille design:

   o weight - a heavy support structure must be provided for the tensioned
     wires (like a piano frame).

   o price (proportional to weight).

   o always a cylindrical screen (this may be considered an advantage
     depending on your preference.

   o visible stabilizing wires which may be objectionable or unacceptable for
     certain applications.

Apparently, there is no known way around the need to keep the fine wires from
vibrating or changing position due to mechanical shock in high resolution
tubes and thus all Trinitron monitors require 1, 2, or 3 stabilizing wires
(depending on tube size) across the screen which can be see as very fine
lines on bright images. Some people find these wires to be objectionable and
for some critical applications, they may be unacceptable (e.g., medical
diagnosis).

@node 4.2 "Why is the Shadowmask or Aperture Grill made of a magnetic material?"

(From: Jeroen Stessen, (stessenj@am.umc.ce.philips.nl))

The question often arises: Well, if magnetization and the need for degauss is
a problem, why not make the shadowmask or aperture grille from something that
is non-magnetic?

The shadowmask MUST be made of magnetic material! This may seem to be
undesirable or counterintuitive but read on:

Together with the internal shielding hood it forms sort of a closed space in
which it is attempted to achieve a field-free space. The purpose of
degaussing is NOT to demagnetize the metal, but to create a magnetization
that compensates for the earth's magnetic field. The SUM of the two fields
must be near zero! Degaussing coils create a strong alternating magnetic
field that gradually decays to zero. The effect is that the present earth
magnetic field is "frozen" into the magnetic shielding and the field inside
the shielding will be (almost) zero. Non-zero field will cause colour purity
errors.

Now you will understand why a CRT must be degaussed again after it has been
moved relative to the earth's magnetic field. This will also explain why
expensive computer monitors on a swivel pedestal have a manual degaussing
button, you must press it every time after you have rotated the monitor.

The axial component of the magnetic field is harder to compensate by means of
degaussing. Better compensation may be achieved by means of a "rotation coil"
(around the neck or around the screen), this requires an adjustment that
depends on local magnetic field. CRT's for moving vehicles (like military
airplanes) may be equipped with 6 coils to achieve zero magnetic field in all
directions. They use magnetic field sensors and active compensation, thus
they don't need any degaussing function. This is too expensive for consumer
equipment.

@node 4.3 "Tubes for all Nations"

(From: Jeroen Stessen, (stessenj@am.umc.ce.philips.nl))

CRT Manufacturers actually make different versions of their tubes for TV's
for the northern and southern hemisphere, and sometimes a 3rd neutral type.
These are so-to-say precorrected for the uncompensated field. (Note that the
term 'tube' here includes much of the convergence hardware as well - not just
what is inside the glass.)

I remember when we exported projection televisions from Belgium to Australia,
a couple of years ago. They all had to be opened on arrival to re-adjust the
rotation settings on the convergence panel, due to the different magnetic
field in Australia. Projection TV's don't have degaussing (there is nothing
to degauss), and the customer can only adjust red and blue shift, not
rotation.

Our CRT application group has a "magnetic cage". This is a wooden cube
(approx. 2 meter long sides) with copper coils around each of the 6 surfaces.
With this they can simulate the earth magnetic field for every place on earth
(as indicated on a map on the wall).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.4 "Degaussing (demagnetizing) a CRT"

Degaussing may be required if there are color purity problems with the
display. On rare occasions, there may be geometric distortion caused by
magnetic fields as well without color problems. The CRT can get magnetized:

   o If the TV or monitor is moved or even just rotated.

   o If there has been a lightening strike nearby. A friend of mine had a
     lightening strike near his house which produced all of the effects of
     the EMP from a nuclear bomb.

   o If a permanent magnet was brought near the screen (e.g., kid's magnet or
     megawatt stereo speakers).

   o If some piece of electrical or electronic equipment with unshielded
     magnetic fields is in the vicinity of the TV or monitor.

Degaussing should be the first thing attempted whenever color purity problems
are detected. As noted below, first try the internal degauss circuits of the
TV or monitor by power cycling a few times (on for a minute, off for 30
minutes, on for a minute, etc.) If this does not help or does not completely
cure the problem, then you can try manually degaussing.

Commercial CRT Degaussers are available from parts distributors like MCM
Electronics and consist of a hundred or so turns of magnet wire in a 6-12
inch coil. They include a line cord and momentary switch. You flip on the
switch, and bring the coil to within several inches of the screen face. Then
you slowly draw the center of the coil toward one edge of the screen and
trace the perimeter of the screen face. Then return to the original position
of the coil being flat against the center of the screen. Next, slowly
decrease the field to zero by backing straight up across the room as you hold
the coil. When you are farther than 5 feet away you can release the line
switch.

The key word here is SLOW. Go too fast and you will freeze the instantaneous
intensity of the 50/60 Hz AC magnetic field variation into the ferrous
components of the CRT and may make the problem worse.

It looks really cool to do this while the CRT is powered. The kids will love
the color effects.

Bulk tape erasers, tape head degaussers, open frame transformers, and the
"ass-end" of a weller soldering gun can be used as CRT demagnetizers but it
just takes a little longer. (Be careful not to scratch the screen face with
anything sharp.) It is imperative to have the CRT running when using these
whimpier approaches, so that you can see where there are still impurities.
Never release the power switch until you're 4 or 5 feet away from the screen
or you'll have to start over.

I've never known of anything being damaged by excess manual degaussing though
I would recommend keeping really powerful bulk tape erasers turned degaussers
a couple of inches from the CRT.

If an AC degaussing coil or substitute is unavailable, I have even done
degaussed with a permanent magnet but this is not recommended since it is
more likely to make the problem worse than better. However, if the display is
unusable as is, then using a small magnet can do no harm. (Don't use a 20
pound speaker or magnetron magnet as you may rip the shadowmask right out of
the CRT - well at least distort it beyond repair. What I have in mind is
something about as powerful as a refrigerator magnet.)

Keep degaussing fields away from magnetic media. It is a good idea to avoid
degaussing in a room with floppies or back-up tapes. When removing media from
a room remember to check desk drawers and manuals for stray floppies, too.

It is unlikely that you could actually affect magnetic media but better safe
than sorry. Of the devices mentioned above, only a bulk eraser or strong
permanent magnet are likely to have any effect - and then only when at
extremely close range (direct contact with media container).

All color CRTs include a built-in degaussing coil wrapped around the
perimeter of the CRT face. These are activated each time the CRT is powered
up cold by a 3 terminal thermister device or other control circuitry. This is
why it is often suggested that color purity problems may go away "in a few
days". It isn't a matter of time; it's the number of cold power ups that
causes it. It takes about 15 minutes of the power being off for each cool
down cycle. These built-in coils with thermal control are never as effective
as external coils.

@node 4.5 "Why are indirectly heated cathodes used in CRT"

Here are three reasons:

  1. The cathode can be made of and/or coated with a material optimal for
     emitting electrons without regard to its performance as a heater.

  2. The separate cathode and filament can be electrically isolated so that
     the filament voltage and cathode drive signal, if any, do not interfere.

  3. The cathode can have an optimal shape for the application. This would be
     particularly significant for CRTs. The spot on the screen is a reduced
     focused image of the effective shape of the emitting portion of the
     cathode.

@node 4.6 "Why do TVs overscan?"

(The following includes material from: Jeroen Stessen
(stessenj@am.nlvxe1.umc.ce.philips.nl))

Q: TVs are always set up to generate a picture which is 10-15 percent large
than the visible face of the CRT. Why?

In the early days of TV, this was probably done to make the design easier.
Component tolerances and power line voltage fluctuations would be masked even
if they caused changes in picture size.

There certainly is almost no reason today to have any more than a couple of
percent overscan. Most modern TVs have very well regulated power supplies and
component values do not really drift much.

Computer monitors, for example, are usually set up for no overscan at all so
that the entire image is visible.

We are constantly reminded of that, now that we are building TV's with VGA
inputs (PD5029C1 in the USA, US$ 2000). This mixed application has overscan
in TV mode and underscan in VGA mode. Geometry adjustment is quite critical
if you see border-on-border.

Unfortunately, TV's may be good but VCR's certainly are not. If you have too
little overscan and then put the VCR in any feature mode (like picture
search) then one (black) picture edge may become visible. Bad form. Viewers
do not like this.

While design considerations may have been the original reason for overscan,
now it has become accepted as a defacto standard, and broadcasters are
counting on the overscan being a certain percentage. One wonders whether it
will ever change or whether this really matters.

I suppose when we have true flat panel digitally addressed displays, we might
have 0% overscan.

At the Japan Electronics Show all the signs are pointed toward flat panel
displays so maybe I will not have to hold your breath for much longer.

Physically, as with an LCD display on a laptop computer, there will be 0%
overscan (no need to build the extra pixels) but that doesn't mean that all
480 lines will be visible.

@endnode
@node 4.7 "Scratches in CRT face"

Minor scratches can be removed with Jeweler's rouge or similar ultra fine
abrasive. Jeweler's Rouge is the same stuff that is used in the final
polishing of lenses and mirrors so it makes for a fine finish. However, any
kind of scratch deep enough to be felt will not yield to this approach.

WARNING: any kind of deep scratch on a CRT should be considered a serious
safety hazard. This may be even more of a concern for modern CRTs that have
'integral implosion protection' - that steel band around the outside'. Older
CRTs used either (1) a separate safety shield - that laminated glass plate in
front of your grandmom's TV - or (2) a second contoured glass panel bonded to
the actual tube face. In both of these cases, the second panel is strictly
protective and serves no structural purpose. Therefore, any damage to it does
not compromise the tube in any way. In the case of modern CRTs, the steel
band in conjunction with the basic tube envelope is used to maintain the
integrity of the overall CRT. Any damage significantly decreases the strength
and increases the risk of CRT implosion.

BTW, scratches in the CRT have absolutely no effect on X-ray emission. X-rays
are blocked long before they come anywhere near the surface and glass has
very little effect on their direction. Any scratch deep enough to have any
detectable effect on X-ray emission (actually, it would need to be an inch
deep gouge) would have caused the tube to implode.

@endnode
@node 5 "Chapter 5) TV Placement and Preventive Maintenance"

5.1) General TV placement considerations

Proper care of a TV does not require much. Following the recommendations
below will assure long life and minimize repairs:

   o Subdued lighting is preferred for best viewing conditions but I will not
     attempt to tell you how to arrange your room!

   o Locate the TV away from extremes of hot and cold. Avoid damp or dusty
     locations if possible. (Right you say, keep dreaming!)

   o Allow adequate ventilation - TVs use more power than any of your other
     A/V components. Heat buildup takes its toll on electronic components.
     Leave at least 3 inches on top and sides for air circulation if the
     entertainment center does not have a wide open back panel. Do not pile
     other components like VCRs on top of the TV if possible (see below).

   o Do not put anything on top of the TV that might block the ventilation
     grill in the rear or top of the cover. This is the major avenue for the
     convection needed to cool internal components.

   o If possible, locate the VCR away from the TV. Some VCRs are particularly
     sensitive to interference from the TV's circuitry and while this won't
     usually damage anything, it may make for less than optimal performance
     due to RF interference. The reverse is sometimes true as well.

   o If possible, locate your computer monitor away from the TV. Interaction
     of the electromagnetic fields of the deflection systems may result in
     one or both displays jiggling, wiggling, or vibrating.

   o Locate loudspeakers and other sources of magnetic fields at least a
     couple of feet from the TV. This will minimize the possibility of color
     purity or geometry problems.

   o Make sure all input-output video and audio connections are tight and
     secure to minimize intermittent or noisy pictures and sound. Use proper
     high quality cable only long enough to make connections conveniently.

   o Finally, store video cassettes well away from all electronic equipment
     including and especially loudspeakers. Heat and magnetic fields will
     rapidly turn your priceless video collection into so much trash. The
     operation of the TV depends on magnetic fields for beam deflection.
     Enough said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2) Preventive maintenance

Preventive maintenance for a TV is pretty simple - just keep the case clean
and free of obstructions. Clean the screen with a soft cloth just dampened
with water and at most, mild detergent. DO NOT use anything so wet that
liquid may seep inside of the set around the edge of the picture tube - you
could end up with a very expensive repair bill when the liquid shorts out the
main circuit board lurking just below. If the set has a protective flat glass
faceplate, there is usually an easy way (on newer sets with this type of
protection) of removing it to get at the inner face of the CRT. Clean both
the CRT and the protective glass with a soft damp cloth and dry thoroughly.
If you have not cleaned the screen for quite a while, you will be amazed at
the amount of black grime that collects due to the static buildup from the
high voltage CRT supply.

In really dusty situations, periodically vacuuming inside the case and the
use of contact cleaner for the controls might be a good idea but
realistically, you will not do this so don't worry about it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.1 "Safety"

TVs and computer or video monitors are among the more dangerous of consumer
electronics equipment when it comes to servicing. (Microwave ovens are
probably the most hazardous due to high voltage at high power.)

There are two areas which have particularly nasty electrical dangers: the
non-isolated line power supply and the CRT high voltage.

Major parts of nearly all modern TVs and many computer monitors are directly
connected to the AC line - there is no power transformer to provide the
essential barrier for safety and to minimize the risk of equipment damage. In
the majority of designs, the live parts of the TV or monitor are limited to
the AC input and line filter, degauss circuit, bridge rectifier and main
filter capacitor(s), low voltage (B+) regulator (if any), horizontal output
transistor and primary side of the flyback (LOPT) transformer, and parts of
the startup circuit and standby power supply. The flyback generates most of
the other voltages used in the unit and provides an isolation barrier so that
the signal circuits are not line connected and safer.

Since a bridge rectifier is generally used in the power supply, both
directions of the polarized plug result in dangerous conditions and an
isolation transformer really should be used - to protect you, your test
equipment, and the TV, from serious damage. Some TVs do not have any
isolation barrier whatsoever - the entire chassis is live. These are
particularly nasty.

The high voltage to the CRT, while 200 times greater than the line input, is
not nearly as dangerous for several reasons. First, it is present in a very
limited area of the TV or monitor - from the output of the flyback to the CRT
anode via the fat red wire and suction cup connector. If you don't need to
remove the mainboard or replace the flyback or CRT, then leave it alone and
it should not bite. Furthermore, while the shock from the HV can be quite
painful due to the capacitance of the CRT envelope, it is not nearly as
likely to be lethal since the current available from the line connected power
supply is much greater.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.2 "Safety Guidelines"

These guidelines are to protect you from potentially deadly electrical shock
hazards as well as the equipment from accidental damage.

Note that the danger to you is not only in your body providing a conducting
path, particularly through your heart. Any involuntary muscle contractions
caused by a shock, while perhaps harmless in themselves, may cause collateral
damage - there are many sharp edges inside this type of equipment as well as
other electrically live parts you may contact accidentally.

The purpose of this set of guidelines is not to frighten you but rather to
make you aware of the appropriate precautions. Repair of TVs, monitors,
microwave ovens, and other consumer and industrial equipment can be both
rewarding and economical. Just be sure that it is also safe!

   o Don't work alone - in the event of an emergency another person's
     presence may be essential.

   o Always keep one hand in your pocket when anywhere around a powered
     line-connected or high voltage system.

   o Wear rubber bottom shoes or sneakers.

   o Don't wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact
     circuitry and conduct current, or get caught in moving parts.

   o Set up your work area away from possible grounds that you may
     accidentally contact.

   o Know your equipment: TVs and monitors may use parts of the metal chassis
     as ground return yet the chassis may be electrically live with respect
     to the earth ground of the AC line. Microwave ovens use the chassis as
     ground return for the high voltage. In addition, do not assume that the
     chassis is a suitable ground for your test equipment!

   o If circuit boards need to be removed from their mountings, put
     insulating material between the boards and anything they may short to.
     Hold them in place with string or electrical tape. Prop them up with
     insulation sticks - plastic or wood.

   o If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits with power
     off, discharge (across) large power supply filter capacitors with a 2 W
     or greater resistor of 100-500 ohms/V approximate value (e.g., for a 200
     V capacitor, use a 20K-100K ohm resistor). Monitor while discharging
     and/or verify that there is no residual charge with a suitable
     voltmeter. In a TV or monitor, if you are removing the high voltage
     connection to the CRT (to replace the flyback transformer for example)
     first discharge the CRT contact (under the insulating cup at the end of
     the fat red wire). Use a 1M-10M ohm 1W or greater wattage resistor on
     the end of an insulating stick or the probe of a high voltage meter.
     Discharge to the metal frame which is connected to the outside of the
     CRT.

   o For TVs and monitors in particular, there is the additional danger of
     CRT implosion - take care not to bang the CRT envelope with your tools.
     An implosion will scatter shards of glass at high velocity in every
     direction. There are several tons of force attempting to crush the
     typical CRT. Always wear eye protection.

   o Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered and
     unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped
     locations or difficult to access locations.

   o If you must probe live, put electrical tape over all but the last 1/16"
     of the test probes to avoid the possibility of an accidental short which
     could cause damage to various components. Clip the reference end of the
     meter or scope to the appropriate ground return so that you need to only
     probe with one hand.

   o Perform as many tests as possible with power off and the equipment
     unplugged. For example, the semiconductors in the power supply section
     of a TV or monitor can be tested for short circuits with an ohmmeter.

   o Use an isolation transformer if there is any chance of contacting line
     connected circuits. A Variac(tm) is not an isolation transformer! The
     use of a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet is a
     good idea but will not protect you from shock from many points in a line
     connected TV or monitor, or the high voltage side of a microwave oven,
     for example. (Note however, that, a GFCI may nuisanse trip at power-on
     or at other random times due to leakage paths (like your scope probe
     ground) or the highly capacitive or inductive input characteristics of
     line powered equipment.) A fuse or circuit breaker is too slow and
     insensitive to provide any protection for you or in many cases, your
     equipment. However, these devices may save your scope probe ground wire
     should you accidentally connect it to a live chassis.

   o Don't attempt repair work when you are tired. Not only will you be more
     careless, but your primary diagnostic tool - deductive reasoning - will
     not be operating at full capacity.

   o Finally, never assume anything without checking it out for yourself!
     Don't take shortcuts!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.3 "Troubleshooting tips"

Many problems have simple solutions. Don't immediately assume that your
problem is some combination of esoteric complex convoluted failures. For a
TV, it may just be a bad connection or blown fuse. Remember that the problems
with the most catastrophic impact on operation like a dead TV usually have
the simplest solutions. The kind of problems we would like to avoid at all
costs are the ones that are intermittent or difficult to reproduce: the
occasional interference or a TV that refuses to play 'StarTrek Voyager'.

If you get stuck, sleep on it. Sometimes, just letting the problem bounce
around in your head will lead to a different more successful approach or
solution. Don't work when you are really tired - it is both dangerous
(especially with respect to TVs) and mostly non-productive (or possibly
destructive).

Whenever working on precision equipment, make copious notes and diagrams. You
will be eternally grateful when the time comes to reassemble the unit. Most
connectors are keyed against incorrect insertion or interchange of cables,
but not always. Apparently identical screws may be of differing lengths or
have slightly different thread types. Little parts may fit in more than one
place or orientation. Etc. Etc.

Pill bottles, film canisters, and plastic ice cube trays come in handy for
sorting and storing screws and other small parts after disassembly. This is
particularly true if you have repairs on multiple pieces of equipment under
way simultaneously.

Select a work area which is wide open, well lighted, and where dropped parts
can be located - not on a deep pile shag rug. The best location will also be
relatively dust free and allow you to suspend your troubleshooting to eat or
sleep or think without having to pile everything into a cardboard box for
storage.

Another consideration is ESD - Electro-Static Discharge. Some components
(like ICs) in a TV are vulnerable to ESD. There is no need to go overboard
but taking reasonable precautions such as getting into the habit of touching
the chassis first before any of the electronic components is a good practice.

A basic set of precision hand tools will be all you need to disassemble a TV
and perform most adjustments. These do not need to be really expensive but
poor quality tools are worse than useless and can cause damage. Needed tools
include a selection of Philips and straight blade screwdrivers, socket
drivers, needlenose pliers, wire cutters, tweezers, and dental picks. For
adjustments, a miniature (1/16" blade) screwdriver with a non-metallic tip is
desirable both to prevent the presence of metal from altering the electrical
properties of the circuit and to minimize the possibility of shorting
something from accidental contact with the circuitry. A set of plastic
alignment tools will be useful for making adjustments to coils and RF
transformers.

A low power (e.g., 25 W) fine tip soldering iron and fine rosin core solder
will be needed if you should need to disconnect any soldered wires (on
purpose or by accident) or replace soldered components. A higher power iron
or small soldering gun will be needed for dealing with larger components.

For thermal or warmup problems, a can of 'cold spray' or 'circuit chiller'
(they are the same) and a heat gun or blow dryer come in handy to identify
components whose characteristics may be drifting with temperature. Using the
extension tube of the spray can or making a cardboard nozzle for the heat gun
can provide very precise control of which components you are affecting.

For info on useful chemicals, adhesives, and lubricants, see "Repair Briefs,
an Introduction" as well as other documents available at this site.

@node 6.4 "Test equipment"

Don't start with the electronic test equipment, start with some analytical
thinking. Your powers of observation (and a little experience) will make a
good start. Your built in senses and that stuff between your ears represents
the most important test equipment you have.

However, some test equipment will be needed:

   o Multitester (DMM or VOM) - This is essential for checking of power
     supply voltages and voltages on the pins of ICs or other components -
     service literature like the SAMs Photofacts described elsewhere in this
     document include voltage measurements at nearly every circuit tie point
     for properly functioning equipment. The multitester will also be used to
     check components like transistors, resistors, and capacitors for correct
     value and for shorts or opens. You do not need a fancy instrument. A
     basic DMM - as long as it is reliable - will suffice for most
     troubleshooting. If you want one that will last for many years, go with
     a Fluke. However, even the mid range DMMs from Radio Shack have proven
     to be reliable and of acceptable accuracy. For some kinds of
     measurements - to deduce trends for example - an analog VOM is preferred
     (though some DMMs have a bar graph scale which almost as good).

   o Oscilloscope - While many problems can be dealt with using just a
     multimeter, a 'scope will be essential as you get more into advanced
     troubleshooting. Basic requirements are: dual trace, 10-20 MHz minimum
     vertical bandwidth, delayed sweep desirable but not essential. A good
     set of proper 10x/1x probes. Higher vertical bandwidth is desirable but
     most consumer electronics work can be done with a 10 MHz scope. A
     storage scope or digital scope might be desirable for certain tasks but
     is by no means essential for basic troubleshooting.

     I would recommend a good used Tektronix or HP scope over a new scope of
     almost any other brand. You will usually get more scope for your money
     and these things last almost forever. My 'good' scope is the militarized
     version (AN/USM-281A) of the HP180 lab scope. This has a dual channel 50
     MHz vertical plugin and a delayed sweep horizontal plugin. I have seen
     these going for under $300 from surplus outfits. For a little more
     money, you can get a Tek 465 100 Mhz scope ($400-700) which will suffice
     for all but the most demanding (read: RF or high speed digital) repairs.

   o A video signal source - both RF and baseband (RCA jacks). Unless you are
     troubleshooting tuner or video/audio input problems, either one will
     suffice. RF sources include a pair of rabbit ears or an outdoor antenna,
     a cable connection, or a VCR with a working RF modulator. This will be
     more convenient than an antenna connection and will permit you to
     control the program material. In fact, making some test tapes using a
     camcorder or video camera to record static test patterns will allow you
     full control of what is being displayed and for how long.

   o Color bar/dot/crosshatch signal generator. This is a useful piece of
     equipment if you are doing a lot of TV or monitor repair and need to
     perform CRT convergence and chroma adjustments. However, there are
     alternatives that are almost as good: a VHS recording of these test
     patterns will work for TVs. A PC programmed to output a suitable set of
     test patterns will be fine for monitors (and TVs if you can set up the
     video card to produce an NTSC/PAL signal. This can be put through a VCR
     to generate the RF (Channel 3/4) input to your TV if it does not have
     direct video inputs (RCA jacks).

@endnode
@node 6.5 "Incredibly Handy widgets"

These are the little gadgets and homemade testers that are useful for many
repair situations. Here are just a few of the most basic:

   o Series light bulb for current limiting during the testing of TVs,
     monitors, switching power supplies, audio power amplifiers, etc. I built
     a dual outlet box with the outlets wired in series so that a lamp can be
     plugged into one outlet and the device under test into the other. For
     added versatility, add a regular outlet and 'kill' switch using a quad
     box instead. The use of a series load will prevent your expensive
     replacement part like a horizontal output transistor from blowing if
     there is still some fault in the circuit you have failed to locate.

   o A Variac. It doesn't need to be large - a 2 A Variac mounted with a
     switch, outlet and fuse will suffice for most tasks. However, a 5 amp or
     larger Variac is desirable. If you will be troubleshooting 220 VAC
     equipment in the US, there are Variacs that will output 0-240 VAC from a
     115 VAC line (just make sure you don't forget that this can easily fry
     your 115 VAC equipment.) By varying the line voltage, not only can you
     bring up a newly repaired TV gradually to make sure there are no
     problems but you can also evaluate behavior at low and high line
     voltage. This can greatly aid in troubleshooting power supply problems.
     WARNING: a Variac is not an isolation transformer and does not help with
     respect to safety. You need an isolation transformer as well.

   o Isolation transformer. This is very important for safely working on live
     chassis equipment. Since all modern TVs use a line connected power
     supply, it is essential. You can build one from a pair of similar power
     transformers back-to-back (with their highest rated secondaries
     connected together. I built mine from a couple of similar old tube type
     TV power transformers mounted on a board with an outlet box including a
     fuse. Their high voltage windings were connected together. The unused
     low voltage windings can be put in series with the primary or output
     windings to adjust voltage. Alternatively, commercial line isolation
     transformers suitable for TV troubleshooting are available for less than
     $100 - well worth every penny.

   o Variable isolation transformer. You don't need to buy a fancy
     combination unit. A Variac can be followed by a normal isolation
     transformer. (The opposite order also works. There may be some subtle
     differences in load capacity.).

   o Degaussing coil. Make or buy. The internal degaussing coil salvaged from
     a defunct TV doubled over to half it original diameter to increase its
     strength in series with a 200 W light bulb for current limiting will
     work just fine. Or, buy one from a place like MCM Electronics - about
     $15 for one suitable for all but the largest TVs. Also, see the section:

@node 6.6 "Safe discharging of capacitors in TVs and video monitors"

It is essential - for your safety and to prevent damage to the device under
test as well as your test equipment - that large or high voltage capacitors
be fully discharged before measurements are made, soldering is attempted, or
the circuitry is touched in any way. Some of the large filter capacitors
commonly found in line operated equipment store a potentially lethal charge.

This doesn't mean that every one of the 250 capacitors in your TV need to be
discharged every time you power off and want to make a measurement. However,
the large main filter capacitors and other capacitors in the power supplies
should be checked and discharged if any significant voltage is found after
powering off (or before any testing - some capacitors (like the high voltage
of the CRT in a TV or video monitor) will retain a dangerous or at least
painful charge for days or longer!)

The technique I recommend is to use a high wattage resistor of about 100
ohms/V of the working voltage of the capacitor. This will prevent the
arc-welding associated with screwdriver discharge but will have a short
enough time constant so that the capacitor will drop to a low voltage in at
most a few seconds (dependent of course on the RC time constant and its
original voltage).

Then check with a voltmeter to be double sure. Better yet, monitor while
discharging (not needed for the CRT - discharge is nearly instantaneous even
with multi-M ohm resistor).

Obviously, make sure that you are well insulated!

   o For the main capacitors in a switching power supply which might be 100
     uF at 350 V this would mean a 5K 10W resistor. RC=.5 second. 5RC=2.5
     seconds. A lower wattage resistor can be used since the total energy in
     not that great. The circuit described below can used to provide a visual
     indication of polarity and charge.

   o For the CRT, use a high wattage (not for power but to hold off the high
     voltage which could jump across a tiny 1/4 watt job) resistor of a few M
     ohms discharged to the chassis ground connected to the outside of the
     CRT - NOT SIGNAL GROUND ON THE MAIN BOARD as you may damage sensitive
     circuitry. The time constant is very short - a ms or so. However, repeat
     a few times to be sure. (Using a shorting clip lead may not be a bad
     idea as well while working on the equipment - there have been too many
     stories of painful experiences from charge developing for whatever
     reasons ready to bite when the HV lead is reconnected.) Note that if you
     are touching the little board on the neck of the CRT, you may want to
     discharge the HV even if you are not disconnecting the fat red wire -
     the focus and screen (G2) voltages on that board are derived from the
     CRT HV.

     If you are not going to be removing the CRT anode connection, replacing
     the flyback, or going near the components on the little board on the
     neck of the CRT, I would just stay away from the fat red wire and what
     it is connected to including the focus and screen wires. Repeatedly
     shoving a screwdriver under the anode cap risks scratching the CRT
     envelope which is something you really do not want to do.

Again, always double check with a reliable voltmeter!

Reasons to use a resistor and not a screwdriver to discharge capacitors:

  1. It will not destroy screwdrivers and capacitor terminals.
  2. It will not damage the capacitor (due to the current pulse).
  3. It will reduce your spouse's stress level in not having to hear those
     scary snaps and crackles.

@node 6.7 "The series light bulb trick"

When powering up a TV (or any other modern electronic devices with expensive
power semiconductors) that has had work done on any power circuits, it is
desirable to minimize the chance of blowing your newly installed parts should
there still be a fault. There are two ways of doing this: use of a Variac to
bring up the AC line voltage gradually and the use of a series load to limit
current to power semiconductors.

Actually using a series load - a light bulb is just a readily available cheap
load - is better than a Variac (well both might be better still) since it
will limit current to (hopefully) non-destructive levels.

What you want to do is limit current to the critical parts - usually the
horizontal output transistor (HOT). Most of the time you will get away with
putting it in series with the AC line. However, sometimes, putting a light
bulb directly in the B+ circuit will provide better protection as it will
limit the current out of the main filter capacitors to the HOT. Actually, an
actual power resistor is probably better as its resistance is constant as
opposed to a light bulb which will vary by 1:10 from cold to hot. The light
bulb, however, provides a nice visual indication of the current drawn by the
circuit under test. For example:

   o Full brightness: short circuit or extremely heavy load - a fault
     probably is still present.

   o Initially bright but then settles at reduced brightness: filter
     capacitors charge, then lower current to rest of circuit. This is what
     is expected when the equipment is operating normally. There could still
     be a problem with the power circuits but it will probably not result in
     an immediate catastrophic failure.

   o Pulsating: power supply is trying to come up but shutting down due to
     overcurrent or overvoltage condition. This could be due to a continuing
     fault or the light bulb may be too small for the equipment.

The following are suggested starting wattages:

   o 40 W bulb for VCR or laptop computer switching power supplies.
   o 100 W bulb for small (i.e., B/W or 13 inch color) TVs.
   o 150-200 W bulb for large color or projection TVs.

Depending on the power rating of the equipment, these wattages may need to be
increased. However, start low. If the bulb lights at full brightness, you
know there is still a major fault. If it flickers or the TV (or other device)
does not quite come fully up, then it should be safe to go to a larger bulb.

@node 6.8 "Getting inside a TV"

You will void the warranty - at least in principle. There are usually no
warranty seals on a TV so unless you cause visible damage or mangle the
screws, it is unlikely that this would be detected. You need to decide. A TV
still under warranty should probably be returned for warranty service for any
covered problems except those with the most obvious and easy solutions.
Another advantage of using warranty service is that should your problem
actually be covered by a design change, this will be performed free of
charge. And, you cannot generally fix a problem which is due to poor design!

Getting into a TV is usually quite simple requiring the removal of anywhere
from 4 to 16 Philips or 1/4" hex head screws - most around the rear edge of
the cabinet or underneath, a couple perhaps in the middle. Disconnect the
antenna and/or antenna or cable wiring first as it may stay with catch on the
rear cover you are detaching. Reconnect whatever is needed for testing after
the cover is removed.

As you pull the cover straight back (usually) and off, make sure that no
other wires are still attached. Often, the main circuit board rests on the
bottom of the cover in some slots. Go slow as this circuit board may try to
come along with the back. Once the back is off, you may need to prop the
circuit board up with a block of wood to prevent stress damage and contact
with the work surface.

Most TVs can still be positioned stably on any of three sides (left, right,
bottom) even without the rear cover. However, some require the cover for
mechanical strength or to not easily fall over. Be careful- larger TVs, in
particular, are quite heavy and bulky. Get someone to help and take
precautions if yours is one of the unstable variety. If need be, the set can
usually safely be positioned on the CRT face if it is supported by foam or a
folded blanket.

Reassemble in reverse order. Getting the circuit board to slide smoothly into
its slots may take a couple of attempts but otherwise there should be no
surprises.

@node 6.9 "Dusting out the inside of a TV"

The first thing you will notice when you remove the cover is how super dusty
everything is. Complements to the maid. You never dreamed there was that much
dust, dirt, and grime, in the entire house!

Use a soft brush (like a new paintbrush) and a vacuum cleaner to carefully
remove the built up dust. Blowing off the dust will likely not hurt the TV
unless it gets redeposited inside various controls or switches but will be
bad for your lungs - and will spread it all over the room. Don't turn
anything - many critical adjustments masquerade as screws that just beg to be
tightened. Resist the impulse for being neat and tidy until you know exactly
what you are doing. Be especially careful around the components on the neck
of the CRT - picture tube - as some of these are easily shifted in position
and control the most dreaded of adjustments - for color purity and
convergence. In particular, there will be a series of adjustable ring
magnets.  It is a good idea to mark their position in any case with some
white paint, 'white out', or a Magic Marker so that if they do get moved - or
you move them deliberately, you will know where you started.

@node 7.1 "User picture adjustment"

For general viewing, subdued lighting but not total darkness is probably
best.  However, for most dramatic impact, a darkened environment may be
preferred. Make the following adjustments under the expected viewing
conditions.

Tune to a strong channel or play a good quality tape.

Turn the brightness, contrast, and color controls all the way down. Center
the tint control (NTSC).

Increase the brightness until a raster is just visible in the darkest
(shadow) areas of the picture.

Increase the contrast until the desired intensity of highlights is obtained.

Since brightness and contrast are not always independent, go back and forth
until you get the best picture.

Initially adjust the color control for pastel shades rather than highly
saturated color. Set the tint control for best flesh tones. Then, increase
the color control to obtain the desired degree of color saturation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.2 "Focus adjustment"

On a decent TV, you should be able to make out the individual scanning lines.
If they are fuzzy, especially in bright areas, then focus may need to be
adjusted.

The focus pot is usually located on the flyback transformer or on an
auxiliary panel nearby. The focus wire usually comes from the flyback or the
general area or from a terminal on a voltage the multiplier module (if used).
It is usually a wire by itself going to the little board on the neck of the
CRT.

Let the set warm up for at least half an hour. Display a good quality signal.
Turn the user color control all the way down and the brightness and contrast
controls all the way up. This will be the worst case. Adjust the focus
control for best overall sharpness - you may not be able to get it perfect
everywhere - center as well as corners. If best focus is at one end of the
focus pot's range and still not good enough, there may be a problem in the
focus divider, focus pot, or some related component.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.3 "Adjustment of the internal SCREEN and color controls"

The screen should be adjusted with a white pattern (snow from the tuner
should do or turn the user COLOR control all the way down to get a black and
white picture). Put the set in Service mode (horizontal line) if it has such
a switch in the back or inside. If not, just use the raster in a darkened
room. Adjust screen for a dim white line (raster). If the line is not white
at its dimmest point, you will need to adjust the drive and cutoff controls
for R, G, & B.

Alternatively, you can use the following procedure:

(From LEE)

Turn R, G, and B screen (or background) controls down. Now turn color control
fully counterclockwise -- off. Now turn up red screen until the screen just
shows a red hue. Now turn red gun down until red tint just goes away. Now do
the same with the green and blue screen controls. Now adjust the two DRIVE
controls for the best black and white picture. That's all there is to it. I
don't like to work with just a thin "SETUP" line. Cartoons seem to be the
best thing to have on while doing the above procedure. You can also use just
plain snow (no program) if you prefer. If you can obtain a good B&W pic. when
you're done, the tube is good and the set if most likely functioning
properly. Be patient and go slow while watching the large mirror that you are
using during this procedure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.4 "Color Balance"

Color balance needs adjustment if the highlights and/or shadows of a black
and white picture (turn the color control all the way down) are not a
perfectly neutral gray.

To adjust the color balance: Turn the color control all the way down so that
you get what should be a B/W picture. Set the user brightness and contrast
controls about mid-range. The tint control should not matter (if it does at
this point, you have other chroma problems or an 'autocolor' switch is on
limiting the range of some controls).

Adjust the sub-brightness controls (may be called color screen, background,
or the like) so that the dark areas of the picture are just visible and
neutral gray. Then, adjust the color gain controls until the brightest areas
are neutral white but not so bright that there is 'color bleeding' in the
highlights.

This should get you close. If something is still shifting after warmup and
get some cold-spray or even a little blower and try to locate the component
that is drifting. Most likely a transistor or capacitor.

@endnode
@node 7.5 "Horizontal position, size, and linearity adjustment"

Horizontal position may be set via a switch or jumper, a pot, or (mostly in
B/W TVs) a set of rings on the CRT neck.

Horizontal size should be set so that there is about 10-15 percent overscan
left and right. This will allow ample margin for power line voltage
fluctuations, component aging, and the reduction in raster size that may
occur with some VCR special effects (fast play) modes.

Many sets no longer have any horizontal size adjustments and depend on
accurate regulation of the voltage to the horizontal output stage to control
horizontal size. There may be a B+ adjustment to perform first.

On those that do, the adjustment may either be done by setting the B+
voltage, by a pot, or a width coil in series with the horizontal deflection
coils.

Modern sets do not generally have any linearity control but you may find this
on older models. You will need to go back and forth between size and
linearity as these adjustments are usually not independent.

Some of the newest sets control all these parameters via settings in
non-volatile memory and use service menus accessed via the remote control for
nearly all setup adjustments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.6 "Vertical position, size, and linearity adjustment"

Vertical position may be set via a switch or jumper, a pot, or (mostly in B/W
TVs) a set of rings on the CRT neck.

Vertical size should be set so that there is about 10-15 percent overscan top
and bottom. This will allow ample margin for power line voltage fluctuations,
component aging, and the reduction in raster size that may occur with some
VCR special effects (fast play) modes.

Some sets no longer have any vertical size adjustments and depend on the
accurate regulation of the voltage to the vertical output stage to control
vertical size.

On those that do, the adjustment is usually a pot in the vertical output
circuitry. If your set has a linearity control, you will need to adjust this
in conjunction with the size control as these are usually not independent.

Some of the newest sets control all these parameters via settings in
non-volatile memory and use service menus accessed via the remote control for
nearly all setup.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.7 "Pincushion adjustments"

There may be two controls - amplitude and phase. Pincushion amplitude as its
name implies, controls the size of the correction. Pincushion phase affects
where on the sides it is applied. Don't expect perfection.

If the controls have no effect, there is probably a fault in the pincushion
correction circuitry.

It is best to make these adjustments with a crosshatch or dot test pattern

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.8 "Geometry adjustment"

This refers to imperfections in the shape of the picture not handled by the
pincushion and size adjustments. These types of defects include trapezoidal
or keystone shaped raster and jogs or wiggles around the periphery of the
raster. Unfortunately, one way these are handled at the factory is to glue
little magnets to strategic locations on the CRT and/or rotate little magnets
mounted on the yoke frame. Unless you really cannot live with the way it is
(assuming there isn't something actually broken), leave these alone! You can
end up with worse problems. In any case, carefully mark the position AND
orientation of every magnet so that if this happens, you can get back to
where you started. If the magnets are on little swivels, some experimenting
with them one at a time may result in some improvement. Of course, it is best
to obtain a service manual and follow its instructions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.9 "Why is the convergence on my set bad near the edges"

Very simple - nothing is quite perfect. Perfect convergence is not even
necessarily possible in theory with the set of adjustments available on a
typical TV. It is all a matter of compromises. Consider what you are trying
to do: get three electron beams which originate from different electron guns
to meet at a single point within a fraction of a mm everywhere on the screen.
This while the beams are scanning at an effective writing rate of 20,000 mph
across the face of a 27" CRT in a variable magnetic environment manufactured
at a price you can afford without a second mortgage!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.10 "CRT purity and convergence problem"

Purity assures that each of the beams for the 3 primary colors - red, green,
and blue - strikes only the proper phosphor dots for that color. A totally
red scene will appear pure red and so forth. Symptoms of poor purity are
blotches of discoloration on the screen. Objects will change shades of color
when the move from one part of the screen to another.

Convergence refers to the control of the instantaneous positions of the red,
green, and blue spots as they scan across the face of the CRT so that they
are as nearly coincident as possible. Symptoms of poor convergence are
colored borders on solid objects or visible separate R, G, and B images of
fine lines or images,

NOTE: It is best to face the set North-South (front-to-back) when doing any
purity and convergence adjustments. Since you have no way of knowing what
orientation will eventually be used, this is the best compromise as the
earth's magnetic field will be aligned front-back. Of course, if you know the
final orientation of the TV in your entertainment center - and you don't
expect to be redecorating, use that instead.

First, make sure no sources of strong magnetic fields are in the vicinity of
the TV - loudspeakers, refrigerator magnets, MRI scanners, etc. A nearby
lightening strike or EMP from a nuclear explosion can also affect purity.

Cycle power a couple of times to degauss the CRT (1 minute on, 20 minutes
off) - see the section: @{"Degaussing (demagnetizing) the CRT" link "4.4"}. If the built in
degaussing circuits have no effect, use an external manual degaussing coil.

Assuming this doesn't help, you will need to set the internal purity and/or
convergence adjustments on the CRT.

First, mark the positions of all adjustments - use white paint, 'White out',
or a Magic Marker on the ring magnets on the neck of the CRT, the position
and tilt of the deflection yoke, and any other controls that you may touch
deliberately or by accident.

NOTE: if your set is still of the type with a drawer or panel of knobs for
these adjustments, don't even think about doing anything without a service
manual and follow it to the letter unless the functions of all the knobs is
clearly marked (some manufacturers actually do a pretty good job of this).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.11 "CRT purity adjustment"

Purity on modern CRTs is usually set by a combination of a set of ring
magnets just behind the deflection yoke on the neck of the CRT and the
position of the yoke fore-aft. As always, mark the starting position of all
the rings and make sure you are adjusting the correct set if rings!

Use the following purity adjustment procedure as a general guide only.
Depending on the particular model TV, the following purity adjustment
procedure may substitute green for red. This depends on the gun placement in
the CRT. This description is based on the SAMs Photofact for the RCA CTC111C
chassis which uses a slot-mask CRT. The procedures for dot-mask and Trinitron
(aperture grille) CRTs will vary slightly. See you service manual!

Obtain a white raster (sometimes there is a test point that can be grounded
to force this). Then, turn down the bias controls for blue and green so that
you have a pure red raster. Let the set warm up for a minimum of 15 minutes.

Loosen the deflection yoke clamp and move the yoke as far back as it will go,

Adjust the purity magnets to center the red vertical raster on the screen.

Move the yoke forward until you have the best overall red purity.

Now, move the yoke forward until you have the best overall red purity.
Tighten the clamp securely and reinstall the rubber wedges (if you set has
these) to stabilize the yoke position. Reset the video adjustments you
touched to get a red raster.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.12 "CRT convergence adjustment"

In the good old days when TVs were TVs (and not just a picture tube with a
little circuit board attached) there were literally drawers full of knobs for
setting convergence. One could spend hours and still end up with a less than
satisfactory picture. As the technology progressed, the number of electronic
adjustments went down drastically so that today there are very few if any.

Unless you want a lot of frustration, I would recommend not messing with
convergence. You could end up a lot worse. I have no idea what is used for
convergence on your set but convergence adjustments are never quite
independent of one another. You could find an adjustment that fixes the
problem you think you have only to discover some other area of the screen is
totally screwed. In addition, there are adjustments for geometry and purity
and maybe others that you may accidentally move without even knowing it until
you have buttoned up the set.

WARNING: Accurately mark the original positions - sometimes you will change
something that will not have an obvious effect but will be noticeable later
on. So it is extremely important to be able to get back to where you started.
If only red/green vertical lines are offset, then it is likely that only a
single ring needs to be moved - and by just a hair. But, you may accidentally
move something else!

If you really cannot live with it, make sure you mark everything very
carefully so you can get back to your current state. A service manual is
essential!

Convergence is set using a white crosshatch or dot test pattern. If you do
not have a test pattern generator, any static scene (from a camcorder or
previously recorded tape, for example) with a lot of fine detail will
suffice.  Turn the color control all the way down so you have a B/W picture.

Static convergence sets the beams to be coincident in the exact center of the
screen. This is done using a set of ring magnets behind the purity magnets on
the CRT neck.

From the SAMs for the RCA CTC111C: "adjust the center set of magnets to
converge blue to green at the center of the screen. Adjust the rear set of
magnets to converge red to green at the center of the screen." Your set may
have a slightly different procedure.

Dynamic convergence adjusts for coincidence at the edges and corners.

On old tube, hybrid, and early solid state TVs, dynamic convergence was
accomplished with electronic adjustments of which there may have been a dozen
or more that were not independent. With modern sets, all convergence is done
with magnet rings on the neck of the CRT, magnets glued to the CRT, and by
tilting the deflection yoke. The clamp in conjunction with rubber wedges or
set screws assures that the yoke remains in position.

From the SAMs for the RCA CTC111C: "Loosen the screws at the 6 o'clock and 10
o'clock positions to permit the yoke to be tilted vertically. Rock yoke up
and down to converge the right and left sides of the screen. Tighten screw at
6 o'clock and loosen screw at 3 o'clock to permit the yoke to be tilted
horizontally. Rock yoke from side to side to converge the top and bottom of
the screen. Tighten screws at 3 o'clock and 10 o'clock."

Many sets simply use the main clamp which locks the yoke to the neck of the
CRT in conjunction with rubber wedges between the yoke and the funnel of the
CRT to stabilize the yoke position position.

Refer to your service manual. (Is this beginning to sound repetitious?

For additional comments on convergence adjustments, see the sections:

@endnode
@node 7.13 "Tilted picture"

You have just noticed that the picture on your fancy (or cheap) TV is not
quite horizontal - not aligned with the front bezel. Note that often there is
some keystoning as well where the top and bottom or left and right edges of
the picture are not quite parallel - which you may never have noticed until
now. Since this may not be correctable, adjusting tilt may represent a
compromise at best between top/bottom or left/right alignment of the picture
edges. You may never sleep again knowing that your TV picture is not perfect!
BTW, I can sympathize with your unhappiness. Nothing is more annoying than a
just noticeable imperfection such as this.

There are several possible causes for a tilted picture:

  1. You just became aware of it but nothing has changed. Don't dismiss this
     offhand. It is amazing how much we ignore unless it is brought to our
     attention. Are you a perfectionist?

  2. There is an external tilt control which may be misadjusted. Newer Sony
     monitors have this (don't know about TVs) - a most wonderful addition.
     Too bad about the stabilizing wires on Trinitron CRTs. A digital control
     may have lost its memory accidentally. The circuitry could have a
     problem.

  3. There is an internal tilt control that is misadjusted. Not common.

  4. The deflection yoke on the CRT has gotten rotated or was not oriented
     correctly at the time of the set's manufacture. Sometimes, the entire
     yoke is glued in place in addition to being clamped adding another
     complication. On some monitors, you can rotate the CRT slightly instead
     but probably not on your TV.

     If the TV was recently bumped or handled roughly, the yoke may have been
     knocked out of position. But in most cases, the amount of abuse required
     to do this with the yoke firmly clamped and/or glued would have totally
     destroyed the set in the process.

     There is a risk (in addition to the risk of frying yourself on the
     various voltages present inside as operating TV) of messing up the
     convergence or purity when fiddling with the yoke or anything around it
     since the yoke position on the neck of the tube and its tilt may affect
     purity and convergence. Tape any rubber wedges under the yoke securely
     in place as these will maintain the proper position and tilt of the yoke
     while you are messing with it. (Don't assume the existing tape will hold
     - the adhesive is probably dry and brittle).

  5. External magnetic fields can sometimes cause a rotation without any
     other obvious effects - have you changed the TV's location?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.1 "Low voltage power supply fundamentals"

TVs require a variety of voltages (at various power levels) to function. The
function of the low voltage power supply is to take the AC line input of
either 115 VAC 60 Hz (220 VAC 50 Hz or other AC power in Europe and
elsewhere) and produce some of these DC voltages. In all cases, the power to
the horizontal output transistor of the horizontal deflection system is
obtained directly from the low voltage power supply. In some cases, a variety
of other DC voltages are derived directly from the AC line by rectification,
filtering, and regulation. In other designs, however, most of the low
voltages are derived from secondary windings on the flyback (LOPT)
transformer of the horizontal deflection system. In still other designs,
there is a separate switchmode power supply that provides some or all of
these voltages. There are also various (and sometimes convoluted)
combinations of any or all of the above.

There will always be:

  1. A power switch, relay, or triac to enable main power.

  2. A set of rectifiers - usually in a bridge configuration - to turn the AC
     into DC. Small ceramic capacitors are normally placed across the diodes
     to reduce RF interference.

  3. One or more large filter capacitors to smooth the unregulated DC. In the
     U.S., this is most often a voltage around 150-160 V DC. In countries
     with 220 VAC power, it will typically be around 300-320 V DC.

  4. A discrete, hybrid, or IC regulator to provide stable DC to the
     horizontal deflection system. Sometimes feedback from a secondary output
     of the flyback or even the high voltage is used. This regulator may be
     either a linear or switching type. In some cases, there is no regulator.

  5. Zero or more voltage dividers and/or regulators to produce additional
     voltages directly from the line power. This relatively rare except for
     startup circuits. These voltages will not be isolated from the line.

  6. A degauss control circuit usually including a thermistor or Posistor (a
     combination of a heater disk and Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC)
     thermistor in a single package). When power is turned on, a relatively
     high AC current is applied to the degauss coil wrapped around the
     periphery of the CRT. The PTC thermister heats up, increases in
     resistance, and smoothly decreases the current to nearly zero over a
     couple of seconds.

  7. A startup circuit for booting the horizontal deflection if various
     voltages to run the TV are derived from the flyback. This may be an IC
     or discrete multivibrator or something else running off a non-isolated
     voltage or the standby power supply.

  8. A standby power supply for the microcontroller and remote sensor.
     Usually, this is a separate low voltage power supply using a small power
     transformer for line isolation.

Always use an isolation transformer when working on a TV but this is
especially important - for your safety - when dealing with the non-isolated
line operated power supply section. Read and follow the safety guidelines.

@node 8.2 "Power button on set is flakey"

If the on/off (or other button) on the set itself behaves erratically but the
remote control works fine, then it could be a dirty button or cable or other
connections to the switch PCB, particularly if the buttons on the set itself
are rarely used. There could possibly be a bad pullup resistor or something
of that sort - but is it worth the effort to locate?

Why not just continue to use the remote? There is no reason to suspect that
it will develop similar symptoms. However, there is some risk that if the
button is dirty, you may find the TV coming on at random times in the middle
of the night (of course!).

I think I have an older Sylvania that does that sort of thing - don't really
know as I never use the power button on the set!

If power is controlled by a hard switch - a pull or click knob, or mechanical
push-push switch and this has become erratic due to worn contacts,
replacements are available but often only directly from the original
manufacturer to physically fit and (where applicable) have the volume or
other controls built in. As an alternative, consider mounting a small toggle
switch on the side of the cabinet to substitute for the broken switch. This
will almost certainly be easier and cheaper - and quite possibly, more
reliable.

@node 8.3 "TV blows fuse"

If the fuse really blows absolutely instantly with no indication that the
circuits are functioning (no high pitched horizontal deflection whine (if
your dog hides under the couch whenever the TV is turned on, deflection is
probably working)), then this points to a short somewhere quite near the AC
power input. The most common places would be:

   o Degauss Posistor - very likely.
   o Horizontal output transistor.
   o Power supply regulator if there is one.
   o Power supply chopper (switchmode) transistor if there is one.
   o Diode(s) in main bridge
   o Main filter capacitor(s).

You should be able to eliminate these one by one.

Unplug the degauss coil as this will show up as a low resistance.

First, measure across the input to the main power rectifiers - it should not
be that low. A reading of only a few ohms may mean a shorted rectifier or two
or a shorted Posistor.

   o Test the rectifiers individually or remove and retest the resistance.

   o Some sets use a Posistor for degauss control. This is a little cubical
     (about 1/2" x 3/4" x 1") component with 3 legs. It includes a line
     operated heater disk (which often shorts out) and a PTC thermister to
     control current to the degauss coil. Remove the posistor and try power.
     If the monitor now works, obtain a replacement but in the meantime you
     just won't have the automatic degauss.

If these test good, use an ohmmeter with the set unplugged to measure the
horizontal output transistor. Even better to remove it and measure it.

   o C-E should be high in at least one direction.
   o B-E may be high or around 50 ohms but should not be near 0.

If any readings are under 5 ohms, the transistor is bad. The parts sources
listed at the end of this document will have suitable replacements.

If the HOT tests bad, try powering the set first with your light bulb and if
it just flashes once when the capacitor is charging, then put a fuse in and
try it. The fuse should not blow with the transistor removed.

Of course, not much else will work either.

If it tests good, power the set without the transistor and see what happens.
If the fuse does not blow, then with the good transistor (assuming it is not
failing under load), it would mean that there is some problem with the
driving circuits possibly or with the feedback from the voltages derived from
the horizontal not regulating properly.

Look inside the TV and see if you can locate any other large power
transistors in metal (TO3) cans or plastic (TOP3) cases. There may be a
separate transistor that does the low voltage regulation or a separate
regulator IC. Some TVs have a switchmode power supply that runs off a
different transistor than the HOT. There is a chance that one of these may be
bad. If it is a simple transistor, the same ohmmeter check should be
performed.

If none of this proves fruitful, it may be time to try to locate a schematic.

A blown fuse is a very common type of fault due to poor design very often
triggered by power surges due to outages or lightening storms. However, the
most likely parts to short are easily tested, usually in-circuit, with an
ohmmeter and then easily removed to confirm.

If you find the problem and repair it yourself, the cost is likely to be
under $25.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.4 "Internal fuse blew during lightening storm (or elephant hit power pole)"

Power surges or nearby lightening strikes can destroy electronic equipment.
However, most of the time, damage is minimal or at least easily repaired.
With a direct hit, you may not recognize what is left of it!

Ideally, electronic equipment should be unplugged (both AC line and phone
line!) during electrical storms if possible. Modern TVs, VCRs, microwave
ovens, and even stereo equipment is particularly susceptible to lightening
and surge damage because some parts of the circuitry are always alive and
therefore have a connection to the AC line. Telephones, modems, and faxes are
directly connected to the phone lines. Better designs include filtering and
surge suppression components built in. With a near-miss, the only thing that
may happen is for the internal fuse to blow or for the microcontroller to go
bonkers and just require power cycling. There is no possible protection
against a direct strike. However, devices with power switches that totally
break the line connection are more robust since it takes much more voltage to
jump the gap in the switch than to fry electronic parts. Monitors and TVs may
also have their CRTs magnetized due to the electromagnetic fields associated
with a lightening strike - similar but on a smaller scale to the EMP of a
nuclear detonation.

Was the TV operating or on standby at the time? If it was switched off using
an actual power switch (not a logic pushbutton or the remote control), then
either a component in front of the switch has blown, the surge was enough to
jump the gap between the switch contacts, or it was just a coincidence (yeh,
right).

If the TV was operating or on standby or has no actual power switch, then a
number of parts could be fried.

TVs usually have their own internal surge protection devices like MOVs (Metal
Oxide Varistors) after the fuse. So it is possible that all that is wrong is
that the line fuse has blown. Remove the cover (unplug it first!) and start
at the line cord. If you find a blown fuse, remove it and measure across the
in-board side of fuse holder and the other (should be the neutral) side of
the line. The ohmmeter reading should be fairly high - well certainly not
less than 100 ohms - in at least one direction. You may need to unplug the
degaussing coil to get a reasonable reading as its resistance may be 25 or 30
ohms. If the reading is really low, there are other problems. If the
resistance checks out, replace the fuse and try powering the TV. There will
be 3 possibilities:

  1. It will work fine, problem solved.

  2. It will immediately blow the fuse. This means there is at least one
     component shorted - possibilities include an MOV, line rectifiers, main
     filter cap, regulator transistor, horizontal output transistor, etc. You
     will need to check with your ohmmeter for shorted semiconductors. Remove
     any that are suspect and see of the fuse now survives (use the series
     light bulb to cut your losses - see the section:
	 @{"The series light bulb trick" link "6.7"}

  3. It will not work properly or appear dead. This could mean there are open
     fusable resistors other defective parts in the power supply or
     elsewhere. In this case further testing will be required and at some
     point you may need the schematic.

If the reading is very low or the fuse blows again, see the section:
@{"TV blows fuse" link "8.3"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.5 "Fuse replaced but TV clicks with power-on but no other action"

The click probably means that the power relay is working, though there could
be bad contacts.

Since the fuse doesn't blow now (you did replace it with one of the same
ratings, right?), you need to check for:

   o Other blown fuses - occasionally there are more than one in a TV.
     Replace with one of exactly the same ratings.

   o Open fusable resistors. These sometimes blow at the same time or in
     place of the fuses. They are usually low values like 2 ohms and are in
     big rectangular ceramic power resistor cases or smaller blue or gray
     colored cylindrical power resistors. They are supposed to protect
     expensive parts like the HOT but often blow at the same time.

If any of these are bad, they will need to be replaced with flameproof
resistors of the same ratings (though you can substitute an ordinary resistor
for testing purposes). Before applying power, check (for shorts):

   o Rectifier diodes
   o Horizontal Output Transistor (HOT)
   o Regulator pass or chopper transistor (if present)
   o Main filter capacitor

An initial test with an ohmmeter can be done while in-circuit. The resistance
across each diode and the collector to emitter of the transistors should be
relatively high - a few hundred ohms at lest - in at least one direction
(in-circuit). If there is a question, unsolder one side of each diode and
check - should be in the Megohms or higher in one direction. Removed from the
circuit, the collector-emitter resistance should be very high in one
direction at least. Depending on the type, the base-emitter resistance may be
high in one direction or around 50 ohms. If any reading on a semiconductor
device is under 10 ohms - then the device most likely bad. Assuming that you
do not have a schematic, you should be able to locate the rectifiers near
where the line cord is connected and trace the circuit. The transistors will
be either in a TO3 large metal can or a TOP3 plastic package - on heat sinks.
The filter capacitor should eventually measure high in one direction (it will
take a while to charge from your ohmmeter). It could still be failing at full
voltage, however.

If you find one bad part, still check everything else as more than one part
may fail and just replacing one may cause it to fail again.

Assuming everything here checks out, clip a voltmeter set on its 500 V scale
or higher across the horizontal output transistor and turn the power on.
Warning - never measure this point if the horizontal deflection is operating.
it is ok now since the set is dead. If the voltage here is 100-150, then
there is a problem in the drive to the horizontal output circuit. If it is
low or 0, then there are still problems in the power supply or with the
winding on the flyback transformer.

Other possible problems:

   o Bad hybrid voltage regulator
   o bad startup circuit
   o Bad relay contacts as mentioned above.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.6 "Power-on tick-tick-tick or click-click-click but no other action"

A variety of power supply or startup problems can result in this or similar
behavior. Possibilities include:

   o Lack of startup horizontal drive - see the section: @{"Startup problems" link "8.12"}
     The main regulator is cycling on overvoltage due to lack of load.

   o Excessive load or faulty power supply cycling on its overcurrent
     protection circuit.

   o HV shutdown, or some other system detecting an out of regulation
     condition. However, in this case, there should be some indication that
     the deflection and HV is attempting to come up - momentary whine, static
     on the screen, etc.

   o A dried up main filter capacitor or other filter capacitor in the low
     voltage power supply that is producing an out-of-regulation condition
     until it warms up. A bad filter capacitor on the output of a series
     regulator may result in excessive voltage and subsequent shutdown.

   o A problem with the microcontroller, relay or its driver, or standby
     power supply.

One possible test would be to vary the line voltage and observe the set's
behavior. It may work fine at one extreme (usually low) or the other. This
might give clues as to what is wrong.

Also see the section: @{"Dead TV with periodic tweet-tweet-tweet or flub-flub-flub" link "8.10"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.7 "No picture or raster and no sound"

The screen is blank with no raster at all. There are indications that the
channel numbers are changing in the display. This indicates that some of the
low voltages are present but these may be derived from the standby supply.

Assuming there is no deflection and no HV, you either have a low voltage
power supply problem, bad startup circuit, or bad horizontal output
transistor (HOT)/bad parts in the horizontal deflection.

Check for bad fuses.

(If you have HV as indicated by static electricity on the front of the screen
and you hear the high pitched whine of the horizontal deflection when it is
turned on, then the following does not apply).

  1. Use an ohmmeter to test the HOT for shorts. If it is bad, look for open
     fusable resistors or other fuses you did not catch.

  2. Assuming it is good, measure the voltage on the collector-emitter of the
     HOT (this is safe if there is no deflection). You should see the B+ -
     probably between 100 and 150 V.

  3. If there is no voltage, you have a low voltage power supply problem
     and/or you have not found all the bad/open parts.

  4. If there is voltage and no deflection (no high pitched whine and no HV),
     you probably have a startup problem - all TVs need some kind of circuit
     to kick start the horizontal deflection until the auxiliary power
     outputs of the flyback are available. Some Zeniths use a simple
     multivibrator for this - a couple of transistors. Others power the
     horizontal osc. IC from a special line-derived voltage. The
     multivibrator type are sometimes designed to fail if someone keeps
     turning the set on and off (like kids playing) since the power rating is
     inadequate.

     Test the transistors if it is that type with an ohmmeter. If one is
     shorted, you have a problem. The usual way a TV service person would
     test for startup problems is to inject a signal to the base of the HOT
     of about 15.75 KHz. If the TV then starts and runs once this signal is
     removed, the diagnosis is confirmed. This is risky - you can blow things
     up if not careful (including yourself).

If you hear the high pitched whine of the deflection and/or feel some static
on the scree, confirm that the horizontal deflection and high voltage are
working by adjusting the SCREEN control (probably on the flyback). If you can
get a raster then your problem is probably in the video or chroma circuits,
not the deflection or high voltage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.8 "Reduced width picture and/or hum bars in picture and/or hum in sound"

The most likely cause is a dried up main filter capacitor. Once the effective
capacitance drops low enough, 120 Hz (or 100 Hz in countries with 50 Hz
power) ripple will make its way into the regulated DC supply (assuming full
wave rectification).

Another likely cause of similar symptoms is a defective low voltage regulator
allowing excessive ripple. The regulator IC could be bad or filter capacitor
following the IC could be dried up.

Either of these faults may cause:

  1. A pair of wiggles and/or hum bars in the picture which will float up the
     screen. For NTSC where the power line is 60 Hz but the frame rate is
     59.94 Hz, it will take about 8 seconds for each bar to pass a given
     point on the screen. (On some sets, a half wave recitifier is used
     resulting in a single wiggle or hum bar).

  2. Hum in the sound. This may or may not be noticeable with the volume
     turned down.

  3. Possible regulation problems resulting in HV or total shutdown or power
     cycling on and off.

The best approach to testing the capacitors is to clip a good capacitor of
approximately the same uF rating and at least the same voltage rating across
the suspect capacitor (with the power off). A capacitor meter can also be
used but the capacitor may need to be removed from the circuit.

Once the capacitors have been confirmed to be good, voltage measurements on
the regulator should be able to narrow down the problem to a bad IC or other
component.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.9 "TV power cycling on and off"

The power light may be flashing or if you are runing with a series light bulb
it may be cycling on and off continuously. There may be a chirping or
clicking sound from inside the set. (NOTE: using too small a light bulb for
the size of the TV may also result in this condition.)

If there is a low voltage regulator or separate switching supply, it could be
cycling on and off if the horizontal output, flyback, or one of its secondary
loads were defective.

Does this TV have a separate low voltage regulator and/or switching power
supply or is it all part of the flyback circuit? For the following, I assume
it is all in one (most common).

Some simple things to try first:

Verify that the main filter capacitor is doing its job. Excessive ripple on
the rectified line voltage bus can cause various forms of shutdown behavior.
An easy test is to jumper across the capacitor with one of at least equal
voltage rating and similar capacitance (make connections with power off!).

Use a Variac, if possible, to bring up the input voltage slowly and see if
the TV works at any point without shutting down. If it does, this could be an
indication of X-ray protection circuit kicking in, though this will usually
latch and keep the set shut off if excessive HV were detected.

@endnode
@node 8.10 "Dead TV with periodic tweet-tweet-tweet or flub-flub-flub"

A TV which appears to be dead except for a once a second or so tweet or flub
usually indicates an overload fault in the power supply has a short in one of
its load circuits, very often a shorted rectifier. It could also be the
flyback, but check the the loads first. Wait a few minutes for the filter
caps to discharge (but stay away from the CRT HV connector as it may retain a
dangerous and painful charge for a long time), use an ohmmeter across the
various diodes in the power supply. Using an ohmmeter on the rectifier
diodes, the resistance in at least one direction should be greater than 100
ohms. If it is much less (like 0 or 5 ohms), then the diode is probably bad.
Unsolder and check again - it should test infinite (greater than 1M ohms) in
one direction.

Other possible causes:

   o Bad solder connections.
   o Other shorted components like capacitors.
   o Other problems in the power supply.
   o Bad flyback.
   o Short or excessive load on secondary supplies fed from flyback.
   o Problem with startup drive (cycling on overvoltage).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.11 "Shorted Components"

A failure of the horizontal output transistor or power supply switchmode
transistor will blow a fuse or fusable resistor.

Look for blown fuses and test for open fusable resistors in the power
circuits. If you find one, then test the HOT and/or switchmode transistor for
shorts.

Other possibilities: rectifier diodes or main filter capacitor.

While you are at it, check for bad connections - prod the circuit board with
an insulated stick when the problem reoccurs - as these can cause parts to
fail.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.12 "Startup problems - nothing happens, click, or tick-tick-tick sound"

TVs and monitors usually incorporate some kind of startup circuit to provide
drive to the horizontal output transistor (HOT) until the flyback power
supply is running. Yes, TVs and monitors boot just like computers.

There are two typical kinds of symptoms: power on click but nothing else
happens or a tick-tick-tick sound indicating cycling of the low voltage (line
regulator) but lack of startup horizontal drive.

Check the voltage on the horizontal output transistor (HOT). If no voltage is
present, there may be a blown fuse or open fusable resistor - and probably a
shorted HOT.

However, if the voltage is normal (or high) - usually 100-150 V, then there
is likely a problem with the startup circuit not providing initial base drive
to the HOT.

The startup circuits may take several forms:

  1. Discrete multivibrator or other simple transistor circuit to provide
     base drive to the HOT.

  2. IC which is part of deflection chain powered off of a voltage divider or
     transformer.

  3. Other type of circuit which operates off of the line which provides some
     kind of drive to the HOT.

The startup circuit may operate off of the standby power supply or voltage
derived from non-isolated input. Be careful - of course, use an isolation
transformer whenever working on TVs and especially for power supply problems.

Note that one common way of verifying that this is a startup problem is to
inject a 15 KHz signal directly into the HOT base or driver circuit (just for
a second or two). If the TV then starts up and continues to run, you know
that it is a startup problem.

CAUTION: Be careful if you do this. The HOT circuit may be line-connected and
it is possible to destroy the HOT and related components if this is not done
properly. I once managed to kill not only the HOT but the chopper transistor
as well while working in this area. An expensive lesson.

I have also seen startup circuits that were designed to fail. Turning the TV
on and off multiple times would exceed the power ratings of the components in
the startup circuit. Some Zenith models have this 'feature'.

When this situation exists, it could be that the circuit is not providing the
proper drive or that due to some other circuit condition, the drive is not
always sufficient to get the secondary supplies going to the point that the
normal circuits take over.

I would still check for bad connections - prod the circuit board with an
insulated stick when the problem reoccurs.

@node 8.13 "TV turns off after warming up"

If you can turn it back on with the s momentary key or power button:

When it shuts off, do you need to push the power button once or twice to get
it back on? Also, does anything else about the picture or sound change as it
warms up?

  1. If once, then the controller is shutting the TV down either as a result
     of a (thermally induced) fault in the controller or it sensing some
     other problem. Monitoring the voltage on the relay coil (assuming these
     is one) could help determine what is happening. The controller thinks it
     is in charge.

  2. If twice, then the power supply is shutting down as the controller still
     thinks it is on and you are resetting it. A couple of possibilities here
     would be low voltage or high voltage regulation error (excessive high
     voltage is sensed and causes shutdown to prevent dangerous X-ray
     emission). A partially dried up main filter capacitor could also cause a
     shutdown but there might be other symptoms like hum bars in the picture
     just before this happened. Clipping a good capacitor across the suspect
     (with power off!) would confirm or eliminate this possibility.

If it uses a pull-knob (or other hard on/off switch), then this may be like
pulling the plug and would reset any abnormal condition.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.14 "TV doesn't power up immediately"

The TV may do nothing, cycle on and off for a while, power up and then
shutdown in an endless cycle - or at least for a while. Then it comes on and
operates normally until it is turned off.

A couple of possibilities:

  1. The main filter capacitor or other filter capacitors in the low voltage
     power supply is dried up and this can cause all kinds of regulation
     problems.

  2. The power supply regulator is defective (or marginal) allowing excessive
     voltage on its output and then the X-ray protection circuitry shuts you
     down.

If you can get access to a Variac, it would be worth bringing up the input
voltage slowly and seeing if there is some point at which it would stay on.

If there is, then if the picture has serious hum bars in it the main filter
cap could be bad. If more or less a decent picture with minor hum bars then
it could be the regulator.

@node 8.15 "Old TV requires warmup period"

So, what else is new? In the old days, a TV was expected to take a few
minutes (at least) to warm up. We are all spoiled today. Of course, you
usually maintained a full time technician or engineer to fiddle with the
convergence adjustments!

A TV (from around 1983) needs at least 5 min. to warm up (lighting up the
screen and making sound if I give it a cold start. Once warmed up, you can it
off and on again from the front panel and it will work immediately. Another
thing this TV has a sub-power switch in the rear.

1983 sounds a bit late, but sets in the late '70 during the transition from
tubes to all solid state chassis often had the 'sub-power' switch providing
some power to the filaments of the CRT and other tubes - usually in the
deflection and high voltage circuits since these would take a while to heat
up and stabilize. The idea was to leave this switch on all the time (except
when going on vacation - it was sometimes labeled 'vacation') so that you
would have nearly instant warm up. Supposedly, this led to an increased risk
of fire as well (see the section: @{"About instant on TVs" link "15.5"}

If it is a totally solid state chassis, then there is some component -
probably a capacitor in the power supply since it affects both picture and
sound - that is drifting with temperature and needs to be located with cold
spray or a heat gun.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.16 "Relays in the Power Circuitry of TVs"

What exactly is the purpose of such a relay ... i.e., why doesn't the power
switch on the TV just apply power directly instead of through a relay?

The usual reason for a relay instead of a knob switch is to permit a remote
control to turn power on and off. If your TV does not have a remote, then it
is simply the same chassis minus 24 cents worth of circuitry to do the remote
function. Isn't marketing wonderful?

The only unknown is the coil voltage. It is probably somewhere in the 6-12
volt range. You should be able to measure this on the coil terminals in
operation. It will be a DC coil.

However, the relay controls the 125 VAC (or 220) which you should treat with
respect - it is a lot more dangerous than the 25KV+ on the CRT!

Almost certainly, the relay will have 4 connections - 2 for power and 2 for
the coil. If it is not marked then, it should be pretty easy to locate the
power connection. One end will go to stuff near the AC line and the other end
will go to the rectifier or maybe a fusable resistor or something like that.
These will likely be beefier than the coil connections which will go between
a transistor and GND or some low voltage, or maybe directly into a big
microcontroller chip.

Of course, the best thing would be to get the schematic. Some big public
libraries carry the SAMs photofact series for TVs and VCRs. If not, take 10
minutes and trace it. You should be able to get far enough to determine the
relay connections.

Once you are sure of the AC connections - measure across them while it is off
and also while it is on. While off, you should get 110-125 VAC. While on and
working - 0. While on and not working either 110-125 VAC if the relay is not
pulling in or 0 if it is and the problem is elsewhere. We can deal with the
latter case if needed later on. Note the even if the relay contacts are not
working, the problem could still be in the control circuitry not providing
the correct coil voltage/current, though not likely.

It may be expensive and/or difficult to obtain an exact replacement, but
these are pretty vanilla flavored as relays go. Any good electronics
distributor should be able to supply a suitable electrical replacement though
you may need to be creative in mounting it.

@node 8.17 "Flameproof Resistors"

Flameproof Resistor or Fusable Resistor are often designated by the symbol
'FR'. They are the same.

You may see these in the switchmode power supplies used in TVs and monitors.
They will look like power resistors but will be colored blue or gray, or may
be rectangular ceramic blocks. They should only be replaced with flameproof
resistors with identical ratings. They serve a very important safety
function.

These usually serve as fuses in addition to any other fuses that may be
present (and in addition to their function as a resistor, though this isn't
always needed). Since your FR has blown, you probably have shorted
semiconductors that will need to be replaced as well. I would check all the
transistors and diodes in the power supply with an ohmmeter. You may find
that the main switch mode transistor has decided to turn into a blob of
solder - dead short. Check everything out even if you find one bad part -
many components can fail or cause other components to fail if you don't
locate them all. Check resistors as well, even if they look ok.

Then, with a load on the output of the power supply use a Variac to bring up
the voltage slowly and observe what happens. At 50 VAC or less, the switcher
should kick in and produce some output though correct regulation may not
occur until 80 VAC or more. The outputs voltages may even be greater than
spec'd with a small load before regulation is correct.

@node 9.1 "Deflection fundamentals"

The electron beams in the CRT need to be scanned horizontally and vertically
in a very precise manner to produce a raster - and a picture.

For NTSC and PAL, the horizontal scan rates are 15,734 and 15,625 Hz
respectively.

For NTSC and PAL, the vertical scan rates are 60 and 50 Hz (approximately)
respectively.

The deflection yoke includes sets of coils for horizontal and vertical
scanning oriented at 90 degrees with respect to each other. Additional coils
are needed to correct for pincushion and other geometric defects.

The deflection circuits must be synchronized and phase locked to the incoming
video signal.

Therefore, we have the following functions:

  1. Sync separator to obtain horizontal and vertical synchronization pulses.

  2. Horizontal oscillator which locks to horizontal sync pulses.

  3. Horizontal drive followed by horizontal output which feeds deflection
     yoke (and flyback for HV and other voltages), Yoke requires a sawtooth
     current waveform for linear horizontal deflection. Horizontal output in
     all but the smaller TVs is a large discrete power transistor, most often
     an NPN bipolar type.

  4. Vertical oscillator which locks to vertical sync pulses. Yoke requires
     sawtooth waveform for linear vertical deflection.

  5. Vertical drive/output which feeds vertical deflection yoke. Newer TVs
     use ICs for vertical drive and output.

  6. Various additional deflection signals to correct for the imperfections
     in the geometry of large angle deflection CRTs. These may be fed into
     the normal deflection coils and/or there may be separate coils mounted
     on the neck of the CRT.

@node 9.2 "Why are nearly all horizontal drivers circuits transformer coupled?"

One (probably secondary) reason is that this provides one of the isolation
barriers between a line-connected HOT and flyback primary and the signal
circuits of the TV.

A more important rational is that a transformer is nice easy way of impedance
matching the horizontal driver circuit (100s to 1000s of ohms) to the few ohm
input impedance of the horizontal output transistor base which requires
upwards of several amps for proper drive. A typical driver transformer may be
in the 5-10:1 turns ratio representing 25-100:1 impedance ratio.

A byproduct of all this is that it is almost impossible for a faulty driver
stage to kill the HOT.

@node 9.3 "Picture squeezed in then died"

You were watching 'Knight Rider' reruns and all of a sudden, the picture
"squeezed in" slowly from the right hand side. It "squeezed in" about 2
inches or so when the entire picture went dead - has remained like this
since. Sound is fine, but no activity at all from the tube. Has it died? How
much time, effort, and expense to fix?

No, it's not dead, at least it certainly is not the picture tube.

Your set probably didn't like Knight Rider - at least that episode!

Seriously, how old is the set? Is it a totally solid state chassis or are
there tubes in the deflection circuits?

Is there any indication of light on the screen? Any indication of the 15735
Hz horizontal running at all? (You would normally hear the high pitch sound).

Newer TVs almost always derive voltages for the sound circuits from the
horizontal deflection but older hybrids may run the sound off of its own
power.

In any case, there is a problem in the horizontal deflection and you probably
have no high voltage as well assuming no light on the screen.

The fact that it squeezed in first indicates that a partial short or other
fault may have developed in the horizontal deflection circuits - possibly the
deflection yoke or flyback transformer. It could also have been a bad
connection letting loose. Once it failed completely, the horizontal output
transistor may have bought the farm or blown a fuse.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.4 "Horizontal deflection shutting down"

Confirm that the horizontal deflection is shutting down (along with the high
voltage since it is derived from horizontal deflection: listen for the high
pitched deflection whine, test for static on the screen, see if the CRT
filaments are lit, turn up the brightness and/or screen control to see if you
can get a raster) and then why:

  1. Power is failing to the horizontal output transistor - this could be due
     to a low voltage power supply problem, bad connection, etc.

  2. Base drive to the horizontal output transistor is failing - could be a
     fault in the horizontal oscillator or bad connection.

  3. Problem with the flyback transformer or its secondary loads (flyback may
     provide other power voltages).

  4. X-ray protection is activating - either due to excess HV or due to a
     fault in the X-ray protection circuitry.

If the problem comes and goes erratically it sounds like a bad connection,
especially if whacking has an effect. If it comes and goes periodically, then
a component could be heating up and failing, then cooling, etc.

@endnode
@node 9.5 "Horizontal lock lost"

A TV which loses horizontal lock when changing channels, momentarily losing
the signal, or switching inputs may have a horizontal oscillator that is way
out of adjustment or has drifted in frequency due to aging components.

Note that the characteristics of this are distinctly different than for total
loss of sync. In the latter case, the picture will drift sideways and/or up
and down while with an off frequency oscillator, the torn up picture will try
at least to remain stationary.

This could be a capacitor or other similar part. Or, the oscillator frequency
may just need to be tweaked (particularly with older sets). There may be an
internal horizontal frequency adjustment - either a pot or a coil - which may
need a slight tweak. If a coil, use a plastic alignment tool, not metal to
avoid cracking the fragile core.

A schematic will be useful to locate the adjustment if any or to identify
possible defective parts. Try a large public library for the SAMs Photofact
for this set.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.6 "Vertical squashed"

This is a vertical deflection problem - possibly a bad capacitor, bad
connection, or other component. None of these should be very expensive (in a
relative sort of way).

Start by substituting a good capacitor for each electrolytic in the vertical
output circuit. Look for bad connections (particularly to the deflection
yoke), then consider replacing the vertical output IC or transistor(s).

The following are NOT possible: CRT, flyback, tuner. (I am just trying to
think of really expensive parts that cannot possibly be at fault).

Note that some movies or laser karaoke discs are recorded in 'letterbox'
format which at first glance looks like a squashed vertical problem. However,
the picture aspect ratio will be correct and turning up the brightness will
reveal a perfectly normal raster above and below the picture.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.7 "Part of picture cut off"

The following applies if the part of the picture is missing but not otherwise
squashed or distorted. For example, 85% is missing but the portion still
visible is normal size.

Wow! That's an interesting one, more so than the typical run-of-the-mill "my
TV just up and died on me". Or, "my pet orangutan just put a hole in the CRT,
what should I do"?

Since the size of the picture fragment is correct but 85% is missing, my
first thought would be to check waveforms going into the vertical output
stage. The supply voltage is probably correct since that often determines the
size. It almost sounds like the waveform rather than being mostly on (active
video) and off for the short blanking period is somehow only on during the
last part of the active video thus giving you just the bottom of the picture.
If there is a vertical output IC, it may be defective or the blanking input
to it may be corrupted. The problem may be as far back as the sync separator.
Then again who knows, maybe wait for the schematics.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.8 "Single Vertical Line"

Since you have high voltage, the horizontal deflection circuits are almost
certainly working (unless there is a separate high voltage power supply -
almost unheard of in modern TVs and very uncommon in all but the most
expensive monitors).

Check for bad solder connections between the main board and the deflection
yoke. Could also be a bad horizontal coil in the yoke, linearity coil, etc.
There is not that much to go bad based on these symptoms assuming the high
voltage and the horizontal deflection use the same flyback. It is almost
certainly not an IC or transistor that is bad.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.9 "Single Horizontal Line"

A single horizontal line means that you have lost vertical deflection. High
voltage is most likely fine since there is something on the screen.

This could be due to:

  1. Dirty service switch contacts. There is often a small switch on the
     located inside on the main board or perhaps accessible from the back.
     This is used during setup to set the color background levels. When
     flipped to the 'service' position, it kills vertical deflection and
     video to the CRT. If the switch somehow changed position or got dirty or
     corroded contacts, you will have this symptom. Flip the switch back and
     forth a couple of times. If there is some change, then replace, clean,
     resolder, or even bypass it as appropriate.

  2. Bad connection to deflection yoke or other parts in vertical output
     circuit. Bad connections are common in TVs and monitors. Check around
     the pins of large components like transformers, power transistors and
     resistors, or connectors for hairline cracks in the solder. Reseat
     internal connectors. Check particularly around the connector to the
     deflection yoke on the CRT.

  3. Bad vertical deflection IC or transistor. You will probably need the
     service manual for this and the following. However, if the vertical
     deflection is done with an IC, the ECG Semiconductor Master Substitution
     guide may have its pinout which may be enough to test it with a scope.

  4. Other bad parts in vertical deflection circuit though there are not that
     many parts that would kill the deflection entirely.

  5. Loss of power to vertical deflection circuits. Check for blown fusable
     resistors/fuses and bad connections.

  6. Loss of vertical oscillator or vertical drive signals.

The most likely possibilities are in the deflection output stage or bad
connections to the yoke.

@endnode
@node 9.10 "Loss of Horizontal Sync (also applies to vertical) after Warmup"

The problem lies either in the horizontal oscillator or in the sync system.
If it really is a problem with sync pulses not reaching the oscillator, the
picture will move around horizontally and can be brought to hold momentarily
with the hold control. If the picture breaks up into strips, there is a
problem in the horizontal oscillator. Rotate the hold control: if the
frequency is too far off, the picture will not settle into place at any
adjustment of the hold control. Look around the horizontal oscillator
circuit: all of the oscillator parts will be right there, or check on the
horizontal oscillator module. Another horizontal problem can occur if the set
is an RCA made from around 1972-1980: these sets are designed to slip very
far off sync if the high voltage is too high, to protect against radiation.
Turning up the brightness will decrease the number of bars if this system is
in question, as the high voltage is decreasing. In this case, check around
the high-voltage regulation system on the deflection systems board. I've had
2 1970's RCA's with this problem. (C.P.H.).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.11 "Intermittent jumping or jittering of picture or other random behavior"

This has all the classic symptoms of a loose connection internal to the TV or
monitor - probably where the deflection yoke plugs into the main PCB or at
the base of the flyback transformer. TVs and monitors are notorious for both
poor quality soldering and bad connections near high wattage components which
just develop over time from temperature cycling.

The following is not very scientific, but it works: Have you tried whacking
the TV when this happened and did it have any effect? If yes, this would be
further confirmation of loose connections.

What you need to do is examine the solder connections on the PCBs in the
monitor, particularly in the area of the deflection circuits and power
supply. Look for hairline cracks between the solder and the component pins -
mostly the fat pins of transformers, connectors, and high wattage resistors.
Any that are found will need to be reflowed with a medium wattage (like 40W)
or temperature controlled soldering iron.

It could also be a component momentarily breaking down in the power supply or
deflection circuits.

One other possibility is that there is arcing or corona as a result of humid
weather. This could trigger the power supply to shut down perhaps with a
squeak, but there would probably be additional symptoms including possibly
partial loss of brightness or focus before it shut down. You may also hear a
sizzling sound accompanied by noise or snow in the picture, static in the
sounds, and/or a smell of ozone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.12 "Horizontal output transistors keep blowing"

Unfortunately, these sorts of problems are often difficult to definitively
diagnose and repair - with expensive component swapping.

You have just replaced an obviously blown (shorted) horizontal output
transistor and an hour later, same symptoms:

Did the new transistor short?

Would the next logical step be a new flyback (LOPT)? Not necessarily.

If the set performed normally until it died, there are other possible causes.
However, it could be the flyback failing under load or when it warms up. I
would expect some warning though - like the picture shrinks for a few seconds
before the poof.

Other possible causes:

  1. Insufficient drive to horizontal output transistor (HOT). A weak drive
     would cause the HOT to either turn on or shut off too slowly greatly
     increasing heat dissipation. Check driver and HOT base circuit
     components.

  2. Excessive voltage on HOT collector - check LV regulator (and line
     voltage if this is a field repair), if any.

  3. Defective safety capacitors or damper diode around HOT. (Though this
     usually results in instant destruction with little heating).

  4. New transistor not mounted properly to heat sink - probably needs mica
     washer and heat sink compound.

  5. Replacement transistor not correct or inferior cross reference.
     Sometimes, the horizontal deflection is designed based on the quirks of
     a particular transistor. Substitutes may not work reliably.

The HOT should not run hot - properly mounted to the heat sink, it should not
be too hot to touch (CAREFUL - don't touch with power on - it is at over a
hundred volts with nasty multihundred volt spikes and line connected -
discharge power supply filter caps first after unplugging). If it is
scorching hot after a few minutes, then you need to check the other
possibilities.

It is also possible that a defective flyback - perhaps one shorted turn -
would not cause an immediate failure and only affect the picture slightly.
This would be unusual, however. See the section:
@{"Testing of flyback (LOPT) transformers" link "9.16"}

Note that running the set with a series light bulb may allow the HOT to
survive long enough for you to gather some of the information needed to
identify the bad component.

@node 9.13 "Vertical foldover"

The picture is squashed vertically and a part of it may be flipped over and

This usually indicates a fault in the vertical output circuit. If it uses an

other component in this circuit. It is probably caused by a fault in the
flyback portion of the vertical deflection circuit - a charge pump that
generates a high voltage spike to return the beam to the top of the screen.

Test components in the vertical output stage or substitute for good ones.

Symptoms are a picture that is as wide as the screen but the vertical height

to about 1/3 of the way up from the bottom. Furthermore, the bottom traces
seem to be overlayed resulting in brighter than normal lines.

This is a common problem for all GE, RCA, ProScan televisions of a variety of

Servicenter. (Thompson Electronics of France owns the names, RCA, GE, and

for carry in service and $95.00 for in-home service. This amount should cover
the bill as any technician who knows what they are doing should be able to
complete the repairs quickly. There is a small chance that the data in the

Examine closely your electrolytic caps on the mother board for leaky ones.
Also look into your horz. circuitry to make sure signals and voltages are
correct. (Gary)

In particular, this sounds like a pincushion problem - to correct for
pincushion, a signal from the vertical deflection that looks something like a
rectified sinewave is used to modify width based on vertical position. There
is usually a control to adjust the magnitude of this signal and also often,
its phase. It would seem that this circuit has ceased to function. If you
have the schematics, check them for 'pincushion' adjustments and check
signals and voltages. If not, try to find the 'pincushion' magnitude and
phase adjustments and look for bad parts or bad connections in in the general
area. Even if there are no adjustment pots, there may still be pincushion
correction circuitry.

If the internal controls have absolutely no effect, then the circuit is
faulty. With modern digital setup adjustments, then it is even tougher to
diagnose since these control a D/A somewhere linked via a microprocessor.

Pincushion adjustment adds a signal to the horizontal deflection to
compensate for the geometry of the CRT/deflection yoke. If you have knobs,
then tracing the circuitry may be possible. With luck, you have a bad part
that can be identified with an ohmmeter - shorted or open. However, without a
schematic even this will be difficult. If the adjustments are digital this is
especially difficult to diagnose since you don't even have any idea of where
the circuitry would be located.

Faulty capacitors in the horizontal deflection power supplies often cause a
similar set of symptoms.

@endnode
@node 9.16 "Testing of flyback (LOPT) transformers"

How and why do flyback transformers fail?

Flybacks fail in several ways:

  1. Overheating leading to cracks in the plastic and external arcing. These
     can often be fixed by cleaning and coating with multiple layers of high
     voltage sealer, corona dope, or even plastic electrical tape (as a
     temporary repair in a pinch).

  2. Cracked or otherwise damaged core will effect the flyback
     characteristics to the point where it may not work correctly or even
     blow the horizontal output transistor.

  3. Internal shorts in the FOCUS/SCREEN divider network, if present. One
     sign of this may be arcover of the FOCUS or SCREEN sparkgaps on the PCB
     on the neck of the CRT.

  4. Internal short circuits in the windings.

  5. Open windings.

More than one of these may apply in any given case.

First, perform a careful visual inspection with power off. Look for cracks,
bulging or melted plastic, and discoloration, Look for bad solder connections
at the pins of the flyback as well. If the TV or monitor can be powered
safely, check for arcing or corona around the flyback and in its vicinity,

Next, perform ohmmeter tests for obvious short circuits between windings,
much reduced winding resistances, and open windings.

For the low voltage windings, service manuals may provide the expected DC
resistance (SAMs PhotoFact, for example). Sometimes, this will change enough
to be detected - if you have an ohmmeter with a low enough scale. These are
usually a fraction of an ohm. It is difficult or impossible to measure the DC
resistance of the HV winding since the rectifiers are usually built in. The
value is not published either.

CAUTION: make sure you have the TV or monitor unplugged and confirm that the
main filter capacitor is discharged before touching anything! If you are
going to remove or touch the CRT HV, focus, or screen wires, discharge the HV
first using a well insulated high value resistor (e.g., several M ohms, 5 W)
to the CRT ground strap (NOT signal ground. See the section:
@{"Safe discharging of capacitors in TVs and video monitors" link "6.6"}

Partially short circuited windings (perhaps, just a couple of turns) and
sometimes shorts in the focus/screen divider will drastically lower the Q and
increase the load the flyback puts on its driving source with no outputs
connected. Commercial flyback testers measure the Q by monitoring the decay
time of a resonant circuit formed by a capacitor and a winding on the flyback
under test after it is excited by a pulse waveform. It is possible to easily
construct testers that perform a well. See the companion document "Testing of
Flyback (LOPT) Transformers" for further information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.1 "HV power supply fundamentals"

Most, if not all, TVs derive the high voltage for the CRT second anode,
focus, and (sometimes) screen (G2) from the horizontal deflection system.
This technique was developed quite early in the history of commercial TV and
has stuck for a very simple reason - it is very cost effective. A side effect
is that if the horizontal deflection fails and threatens to burn a (vertical)
line into the CRT phosphors, the high voltage dies as well.

Most TV high voltage supplies operate as follows:

  1. Horizontal output transistor (HOT) turns on during scan. Current
     increases linearly in primary of flyback transformer since it appears as
     an inductor. Magnetic field also increases linearly. NOTE: flyback is
     constructed with air gap in core. This makes it behave more like an
     inductor as far as the primary drive is concerned.

  2. HOT shuts off at end of scan. Current decreases rapidly. Magnetic field
     collapses inductively coupling to secondary and generates HV pulse.
     Inductance and capacitance of flyback, snubber capacitors, and parasitic
     capacitance of circuitry and yoke form a resonant circuit. Ideally,
     voltage waveform across HOT during flyback (retrace) period will be a
     single half cycle and is clamped by damper diode across HOT to prevent
     undershoot.

  3. Secondary of flyback is either a single large HV winding with HV
     rectifiers built in (most often) or an intermediate voltage winding and
     a voltage multiplier (see the section: @{"What is a tripler" link "10.2"}) The output
     will be DC HV pulses.

  4. The capacitance of the CRT envelope provides the needed filtering to
     adequately smooth the HV pulses into a DC voltage.

  5. A high resistance voltage divider provides the several KV focus voltage
     and sometimes the several hundred volt screen (G2) voltage as well.
     Often, the adjustments for these voltages are built into the flyback.
     Sometimes they are mounted separately.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.2 "What is a tripler?"

In some TVs, the flyback transformer only generates about 6-10 KV AC which is
then boosted by a capacitor-diode ladder to the 18-30 KV needed for modern
color CRTs. The unit that does this is commonly called a tripler since it
multiplies the flyback output by about 3 times. Some TVs use a quadrupler
instead. However, many TVs generate the required HV directly with a winding
with the required number of turns inside the flyback transformer.

Triplers use a diode-capacitor ladder to multiply the 6-10 KV AC to 18-30 KV
DC. Many triplers are separate units, roughly cubical, and are not
repairable. Some triplers are built in to the flyback - it is probably
cheaper to manufacture the HV diodes and capacitors than to wind a direct
high voltage secondary on the flyback core. In either case, failure requires
replacement of the entire unit.

For external multipliers, the terminals are typically marked:

   o IN - from flyback (6-10 KV AC).
   o OUT - HV to CRT (20-30 KV DC).
   o F - focus to CRT (2-8 KV).
   o CTL - focus pot (many megohm to ground).
   o G, GND, or COM - ground.

Symptoms of tripler failure are: lack of high voltage or insufficient high
voltage, arcing at focus protection spark gap, incorrect focus voltage, other
arcing, overload of HOT and/or flyback, or focus adjustment affecting
brightness (screen) setting or vice-versa.

@endnode
@node 10.3 "High voltage shutdown due to X-ray protection circuits"

A TV that runs for a while or starts to come on but then shuts down may have
a problem with the X-ray protection circuitry correctly or incorrectly
determining that the high voltage (HV) is too great (risking excessive X-ray
emission) and shutting everything down.

A side effect of activation of this circuitry is that resetting may require
pulling the plug or turning off the real (hard) power switch.

Is there anything else unusual about the picture lately that would indicate
an actual problem with the HV? If this is the case, then there may be some
problem with the HV regulation. If not, the shutdown circuit may be overly
sensitive or one of its components may be defective - a bad connection of
leaky cap (or zener).

One symptom of excessive HV (but not required) is an overly bright picture of
reduced size.

The HV shutdown circuit usually monitors a winding off of the flyback for
voltage exceeding some reference and then sets a flip flop shutting the
horizontal drive off.

On some Sony models, a HV resistive divider performs this function and these
do fail - quite often. The red block called a 'HV capacitor' is a common
cause of immediate or delayed shutdown on certain Sony monitors and TVs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.4 "Low or no high voltage"

Most of these problems are due to faults in the horizontal deflection system
- shorted HOT, shorted windings or HV rectifiers in the flyback, defective
tripler, or other bad parts on the primary side of the flyback.

However, if you discover an inch layer of filth inside the TV, the HV could
simply be shorting out - clean it first.

In most cases, these sorts of faults will put an excessive load on the
horizontal output circuits so there may be excessive heating of the HOT or
other components. You may hear an audible arcing or sizzling sound from
internal shorts in the flyback or tripler. Either of these may bet hot,
crack, bulge, or exhibit visible damage if left on with the fault present.

Most modern TVs do not regulate HV directly but rather set it via control of
the low voltage power supply to the HOT (B+), by snubber capacitors across
the HOT, and the turns ratio of the flyback. The HV is directly related to
the B+ so if this is low, the HV will be low as well. Faulty snubber
capacitors will generally do the opposite - increase the HV and the X-ray
protection circuits may kick in. However, low HV is also a possibility. The
only way the turns ratio of the flyback can change is from a short which will
manifest its presence in other ways as well - excessive heating and load on
the horizontal output circuits.

While a shorted second anode connection to the CRT is theoretically possible,
this is quite unlikely (except, as noted, due to dirt).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.5 "Excessive high voltage"

Any significant increase in HV should cause the X-ray protection circuits to
kick in and either shut down the set or modify the deflection in such a way
as to render it harmless.

Symptoms include arcing/sparking of HV, smaller than normal picture, and
under certain scenarios, possible excessive brightness.

Causes of the HV being too high are:

  1. Excess B+ voltage to the HOT. The likely cause is to a low voltage
     regulator failure.

  2. Open snubber capacitors across the HOT. These are under a lot of stress
     and are located near hot components so failure is possible.

  3. Incorrect excessively long scan drive to HOT caused by failure of
     horizontal oscillator/sync circuits. However, other things like the HOT
     will probably blow up first. The picture will definitely be messed up.

  4. Failure of HV regulator (tube sets and a few solid state sets - actual
     HV regulators are relatively uncommon today.) This may result in an
     underscanned (smaller than normal) picture.

@node 10.6 "Arcing, sparking, or corona from CRT HV anode (red wire/suction cup)"

Symptoms could include a sizzling corona or more likely, an occasional or
rapid series of sharp snaps - possibly quite loud and quite visible - from
the anode cap on the CRT to the grounded coating on the outside of the CRT or
a chassis ground point (or any other conductor nearby). Corona is a high
resistance leakage through the air without total breakdown. The snapping is
caused by the sudden and nearly complete discharge of the CRT anode
capacitance through a low resistance ionized path similar to lightening.

There are two likely causes:

  1. Dirt, dust, grime, around and under the suction cup on the CRT are
     providing a discharge path. This may be more severe in humid weather.
     Safely discharge the HV and then remove and thoroughly clean the HV
     suction cup and the area under it and on the CRT for several inches
     around the HV connection. Make sure there are no loose wires or other
     possible places for the HV to discharge to in the vicinity.

  2. The high voltage has gone through the roof. Usually, the X-ray
     protection circuitry should kick in but it can fail. If cleaning does
     not help, this is a likely possibility. See the sections:
     @{"High voltage shutdown due to X-ray protection circuits" link "10.3"} and
     @{"Excessive high voltage" link "10.5"}

@node 10.7 "Arcing at CRT sparkgaps"

This is rarely due to a defective sparkgap but rather is a safety mechanism
like a fuse designed to protect the internal electrodes of the CRT if the
focus or screen voltage should become excessive. The sparkgap breaks down
first and prevents internal arcing in the CRT.

An arcing sparkgap is usually accompanied by total loss of picture or bad
focus, brightness or focus fluctuations, or any of a number of similar
symptoms. The usual cause is a breakdown inside the focus divider inside the
flyback or tripler. Sometimes, it is in a component that can be disassembled
and cleaned but not generally. Replacement of the bad part will be needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.8 "Arcing from flyback or vicinity"

If the arc is coming from a specific point on the flyback - a crack or
pinhole - this may be patched using high voltage sealer or even a few layers
of plastic electrical tape. This may prove to be a permanent repair although
starting the search for a source for a new flyback would not hurt just in
case. The arc most likely did damage the insulation internally which may or
may not be a problem in the future.

In some cases, the pinhole or crack is an indication of a more serious
problem - overheating due to shorted windings in the flyback or excessive
secondary load.

First, clean the areas around the arc thoroughly and then try several layers
of plastic electrical tape. If the TV works normally for say, an hour, then
there is probably nothing else wrong and you can try for a proper sealing job
or hope that tape holds out (put a few more layers on - each is good for
about 8-10 KV theoretically).

If the arc is from one of the sparkgaps around the CRT, this could also be a
flyback problem indicating internal shorts in the focus/screen network.

Once I had a TV where the main problem was a cracked flyback arcing but this
took out one of the fusable resistors for the power supply to the VERTICAL
output so the symptoms included a single horizontal line. Don't ask me to
explain - replacing that resistor and the flyback (the flyback tested good,
but this was for someone else) fixed the TV.

In another case, a pinhole developed in the flyback casing probably due to
poor plastic molding at the time of manufacture. This resulted in a most
spectacular case of sparking to a nearby bracket. A few layers of electrical
tape was all that was needed to affect a permanent repair.

@node 10.9 "Ozone smell and/or smoke from TV"

Smoking is just as bad for TVs as for people and usually more quickly
terminal.

White acrid smoke may indicate a failed electrolytic capacitor in the power
supply probably in conjunction with a shorted rectifier. Needless to say,
pull the plug at once.

A visual inspection should be able to easily confirm the bad capacitor as it
will probably be bulging and have condensed residue nearby. Check the
rectifier diodes or bridge rectifier with an ohmmeter. Resistance across any
pair of leads should be more than a few ohms in at least one direction.
Remove from the circuit to confirm. Both the faulty diode(s) and capacitor
should be replaced (though the capacitor may work well enough to test with
new diode(s).

If a visual inspection fails to identify the smoking part, you can probably
plug the set in for a few seconds until the source of the smoke is obvious
but be prepared to pull the plug in a real hurry.

If the smell/smoke is coming from the flyback, then it has probably gone
belly up. You may be able to see a crack or bulge in the case. While the
flyback will definitely need to be replaced, it is likely that nothing else
is wrong. However, it might be prudent to use a Variac when performing
initial testing with the replacement just in case there is a secondary short
circuit or excess HV problem.

@node 10.10 "Should I be worried about X-ray exposure while servicing a TV or monitor?"

The only source of X-rays in a modern TV or monitor is from the CRT. X-rays
are generated when a high velocity electron bean strikes a heavy metal
target.  For anything you are likely to encounter, this can only happen in a
vacuum - thus inside the CRT. The higher the voltage, the greater the
velocity and potential danger.

The thick front CRT faceplate protects users adequately but there may be some
emission from the thinner sides. At 25-30 KV (quite low as X-ray energies go)
X-rays will be stopped by almost any metal so what you have to worry about is
where there are no shields.

However, realistically, there is very little and I would not worry about
exposure unless you plan to be sitting for hours on the sides, behind, or
under the TV or monitor - with a picture (there will be none if the screen is
black).

Your 4 year old son shot the Sony in the flyback transformer. Smoke and

Who says these FAQs cannot be funny?

Needless to say, unplug the set immediately. Inspect around the target area
for obviously blown or damaged components. Test fuses and fusable resistors.
Repair burnt solder connections and circuit board traces. Once the set is
entirely dried out, power it up - preferably through a series light bulb
and/or Variac until you are sure nothing else will let loose. Look, listen,
and smell for any unusual behavior. If it now works, then consider yourself
lucky. If not, there may be damage to transistors, ICs, or other components.

(The following from: edison@nelson.planet.org.nz (Richard Symonds)).

We're seeing another 'hazard' these days, people cleaning their television
screens with window cleaner - no problem in the days of separate chassis but
with the entire p.c.b. jammed under the tube on most t.v.s these days just a
few drips and its all over. Some have just corroded the switch banks (had one
recently just got into the A/V switch - when you walked around the room the
set changed to A/V and back by itself!) but a few have got around the
microprocessors and surface mount components and resulted in complete
write-offs. I suppose the damage is the opposite of electroplating as the
microp's have constant voltage to them. Never mind, they'll be a good source
of parts for future use.

@node 11.1 "No color - black and white picture"

This means absolutely no color - equivalent to a black and white picture. Not
even a hint of color.

First, confirm that the source is actually in color - try another channel or
input device.

Next, check the settings of the color control - it may have accidentally been
turned down. If your TV has some kind of automatic picture mode, try turning
if off and adjusting the color control. Try adjusting fine tuning if you have
such a control and the problem is with a broadcast or cable transmission.

At this point with a confirmed color signal source, there is a problem with
the chroma circuitry.

Note that to the average person, the obvious question becomes: is my color
picture tube bad? The answer is a definitive NO. It is virtually impossible
for a defective CRT to cause a total loss of color. A defective CRT can cause
a lack of a primary color - R, G, or, B which will mess up the color but is
not likely to result in a black and white picture.

Some possibilities in no particular order:

  1. Weak signal or defect in tuner/IF causing loss of signal strength.
  2. Coler killer set too high (internal control) if it has one.
  3. Defective part around the chroma chip/circuit. Faulty color oscillator.
  4. Bad connections in area of chroma chip/circuit.
  5. Defective chroma chip (don't suspect this first just because it is
     probably very expensive).

A service manual or SAMs, DMM, & scope will help greatly in attempting to
troubleshoot this unless it is an obvious bad connection. Try prodding the
main board around the chroma chip with an insulated tool to see if you can
make the color come and go.

I had one set where a $.02 resistor decided to open up causing just this
problem - perfect BW picture, no color. Another had a coil with a broken
wire.

The means colors that are not normal and that adjustment of the user controls

blues in scenes that should have these colors..

Make sure the user color and tint controls have not been accidentally turned

Perform the user setup described in the section: @{"User picture adjustment" link "7.1"}

Confirm that the source is not a weird color video - try another channel or a
tape.

Verify that this is not a missing color problem - one of the primary R, G, or
B, has disappeared. If so, refer to the section: @{"Missing colors" link "11.4"}

Once these have been eliminated, you are left with the following
possibilities:

  1. Defective part around the chroma chip/circuit. Misadjusted color
     oscillator.
  2. Bad connections in area of chroma chip/circuit.
  3. Defective chroma chip (don't suspect this first just because it is

A service manual or SAMs, DMM, & scope will help greatly in attempting to
troubleshoot this unless it is an obvious bad connection. Try prodding the

Something as simple as a bad resistor or inductor can be the cause - don't

@node 11.3 "TV and Monitor Manufacturing Quality and Cold Solder Joints"

Any intermittent problems with monitors that cause random sudden changes in
the picture brightness, color, size, or position are often a result of bad
connections.

Bad solder joints are very common in TVs and monitors due both to poor
quality manufacturing as well as to deterioration of the solder bond after
numerous thermal cycles and components running at high temperature. Without
knowing anything about the circuitry, it is usually possible to cure these
problems by locating all bad solder connections and cleaning and reseating
internal connectors. The term 'cold solder joint' strictly refers to a solder
connection that was either not heated enough during manufacturing, was cooled
too quickly, or where part pins were moved before the solder had a chance to
solidify. A similar situation can develop over time with thermal cycling
where parts are not properly fastened and are essentially being held in by
the solder alone. Both situations are most common with the pins of large
components like transformers, power transistors and power resistors, and
large connectors. The pins of the components have a large thermal mass and
may not get hot enough during manufacturing. Also, they are relatively
massive and may flex the connection due to vibration or thermal expansion and
contraction.

To locate cold solder joints, use a strong light and magnifier and examine
the pins of large components for hairline cracks in the solder around the
pin.  Gently wiggle the component if possible (with the power off). Any
detectable movement at the joint indicates a problem. With the power on,
gently prod the circuit board and suspect components with an insulated tool
to see if the problem can be effected.

When in doubt, resolder any suspicious connections. Some monitors may use
double sided circuit boards which do not have plated through holes. In these
cases, solder both top and bottom to be sure that the connections are solid.
Use a large enough soldering iron to assure that your solder connection is
solid. Put a bit of new solder with flux on every connection you touch up
even if there was plenty of solder there before.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.4 "Intermittent or Missing Colors"

If gently whacking the set can make the color(s) come and go, then bad
connections are a very likely possibility.

The the effect is sudden - the color drops in and out instantly, it is not a
CRT problem.

If the color fades in and out with a delay of about 10-15 seconds, it is
probably intermittent power to the CRT filament for that color and probably
means a bad CRT since the three filaments are wired in parallel inside the
CRT and one of the internal connections has come loose.

  1. Look in the neck of the CRT to make sure all three filaments are glowing
     orange. If one is out or goes on and off toss the set. Replacing the CRT
     is probably not worth it. However, if they all go on and off together
     (all colors would be fading in and out though perhaps not quite in
     unison), then bad connections on the video driver board (on the neck of
     the CRT) are indicated.

  2. Locate the output for the bad color on the video driver board on the
     neck of the CRT. This will probably read a significantly higher voltage
     than the corresponding pins for the good colors. A circuit problem is
     likely - probably on this board.

  3. Test components on this board for the good and bad color channels. A
     shorted transistor or open resistor can kill one channel. Swap parts to
     confirm.

This is a catch-all for some of the most common TV and monitor problems.

Most of the causes of intermittent colors boil down to bad connections of one
form or another. For totally dead colors - not intermittent - bad components
are also a possibility.

  1. Printed circuit board on the CRT neck. This is a common location for
     cold solder joints. Check with a bright light and magnifying glass for
     hairline cracks around the pins of larger parts. Prod and tap with an
     insulated tool to see if the problem is effected. Resolder if necessary.

  2. Cold solder joints elsewhere in TV or monitor usually around the pins of
     large parts such as transformers, power transistors and resistors, and
     internal connectors.

  3. Internal connectors that need to be cleaned and reseated. Remove, clean
     with contact cleaner, burnish, and replace.

@node 11.5 "Red, green, or blue full on - fog over picture"

This could be a heater-cathode (H-K) short in the CRT or a failure of a
component in the chroma circuits or video output (driver board).

Don't panic - heater-cathode shorts in CRTs can often be worked around.

Some simple tests can confirm or rule out other possibilities.

Compare the voltages for the video drive signals to the CRT on the little
board on the neck of the CRT with the CRT both connected and unplugged. A
schematic will help greatly in locating these signals.

If there is a significant difference especially on the bad color, then the
CRT is a likely candidate. Try tapping the neck of the CRT GENTLY (with it
plugged in and while viewing a picture) to see if it is an intermittent
problem. Might want to have eye protection on while doing this!

If there is no significant difference, you may have a bad driver or a problem
in the chroma circuits.

Look for bad connection/cold solder joints, probably on the little board on
the neck of the CRT. Use an insulated stick to gently prod the board and its
components in an effort to induce/cure the problem. Look carefully for
hairline cracks around the component leads.

You can swap components between two colors and/or test with an ohmmeter on
that driver board to determine what is bad. The nice thing about color
monitors and TVs is that there three copies of each of these components.
Swapping and/or comparisons between these is an excellent diagnostic
technique.

Alternatively, interchange the outputs of the bad color with a good one by
jumpering on the video driver board (on the CRT neck). If the bad color
changes, then the problem is in the circuitry and not the CRT.

@endnode
@node 11.6 "Providing isolation for a CRT H-K short"

This procedure will substitute a winding of your own for the one that is
built in to the flyback to isolate the shorted filament from the ground or
voltage reference. Note that if you have a schematic and can determine where
to disconnect the ground or voltage reference connection to the filament
winding, try this instead.

The flyback is the thing with the fat red wire coming out of it (and perhaps
a couple of others going to the CRT board or it is near this component if
your set has a separate tripler) and may have a couple of controls for focus
and screen. It should have some exposed parts with a ferrite core about
1/2-3/4" diameter.

The filament of the CRT is the internal heater for each gun - it is what
glows orange when the set is on. What has happened is that a part of the fine
wire of the bad color's filament (assuming this is indeed your problem) has
shorted to the cathode - the part that actually emits the electrons.
Normally, the heater circuit is grounded or tied to a reference voltage so
when it shorts to the cathode, the cathode voltage level is pulled to ground
or this reference.

You will need some well insulated wire, fairly thick (say #18-22). Find a
spot on the flyback where you can stick this around the core. Wrap two turns
around the core and solder to the CRT filament pins after cutting the
connections to the original filament source (scribe the traces on the board
to break them). This winding should cause the filaments to glow about the
same brightness as before but now isolated from ground. If they are too dim,
put another turn on the flyback to boost the voltage. (Don't go overboard as
you may blow the filament totally if you put too many turns on the core - you
then toss the TV.) Route the wires so that there is no chance of them getting
near the high voltage or any sharp metal edges etc. Your picture quality may
be a tad lower than it was before because of the added stray capacitance of
the filament wiring being attached to the the (formerly bad) video signal,
but hey, something is better than nothing.

@endnode
@node 11.7 "Rescuing a shorted CRT"

If the short is filament-cathode (H-K), you don't want to use the following
approach since you may blow out the filament in the process. If this is the
case, you may be able to float the filament and live with the short (see the
section on: @{"Red, green, or blue full on - fog over picture" link "11.5"}

Shorts in the CRT that are between directly accessible electrodes can be
dealt with in a more direct way than for H-K shorts. At this point you have
nothing to loose. A shorted CRT is not real useful.

If the short is between two directly accessible electrodes like cathode-grid,
then as a last resort, you might try zapping it with a charged capacitor.
Start with a relatively small capacitor - say a few uF at a couple hundred
volts. Check to see if the short is blown after each zap - few may be needed.
Increase the capacitance if you fell lucky but have had little success with
the small capacitor.

If the fault is intermittent, you will, of course, need to catch the CRT with
the socket disconnected and the short still present. Try some gentle tapping
if necessary. If you do this with the charged capacitor across the suspect
electrode, you WILL know when the short occurs!

@node 11.8 "Brightening an old CRT"

If performing adjustments of the internal background and/or screen controls
still results in a dark picture even after a long warmup period, the CRT may
simply be near the end of its useful life. In the old days of TVs with short
lived CRTs, the CRT brightener was a common item (sold in every corner
drugstore, it seemed!).

You can try a similar approach. CAUTION: this may shorten the life of the CRT
- possibly quite dramatically (like it will blow in a couple of seconds or
minutes). However, if the monitor or TV is otherwise destined for the scrap
heap, it is worth a try.

The approach is simple: you are going to increase the voltage to the
filaments of the electron guns making them run hotter. Hopefully, just hotter
enough to increase the brightness without blowing them out.

Voltage for the CRT filament is usually obtained from a couple of turns on
the flyback transformer. It is usually easy to add an extra turn or two which
will increase the voltage and thus the current making the filaments run
hotter. This will also shorten the CRT life - perhaps rather drastically.
However, if the monitor was headed for the dumpster anyhow, you have nothing
to lose.

There are also commercial CRT rejuvenators that supposedly zap the cathodes
of the electron guns. A TV repair shop may be able to provide this service,
though it is, at best, a short term fix.

this case, only highlights are affected.

One cause of this is that the color gain, contrast, or intensity controls

The following is from: (Ian White (100743.1026@COMPUSERVE.COM)).

Check the power supplies to the video circuits as well as the CRT filament

@node 11.11 "Picture fades in and out"

If the picture faded away on the order of 10-20 seconds (and if it comes
back, also comes up to full brightness in same time frame - possibly with the
persuasion of some careful whacking) AND with NO other significant changes
such as size, focus, etc., then take a look in the back of the tube for the
filament to be lit - the orange glow near the CRT socket. If there is none,
then you probably have a bad solder connection on the circuit board on the
neck of the CRT. Look for fine cracks around pins on that board. Try prodding
it with an insulating stick to see if the picture comes back. Resolder if
necessary. It is probably not a bad CRT as the filaments are usually wired in
parallel and all would not go bad at the same time.

However, if only a single color fades in and out, then a bad connection
inside the CRT is a distinct possibility - look for only one of the
filament's glow to be coming and going. This is probably not worth fixing.

If the picture faded away with other symptoms, then there is probably a fault
in the video amplifier/output one of its power supplies - still probably a
loose connection if you are able to get it back by whacking.

@node 11.12 "Occasional brightness flashes"

These may last only a fraction of a scan line or much much longer.

This could mean an intermittent fault in a variety of places including the

   o Brightness circuitry - SCREEN, master background or its power supply.
     Could be in or around flyback or focus/screen divider. Could perhaps be
     in the CRT, but probably less likely.

   o Video amp before or at chroma demodulator - since after this point, you
     would most likely get colored flashes since only one of the RGB signals
     would likely be effected.

If you get it from all sources, then tuner/IF is ruled out.

Suppose you just have no signal to a direct video input. What do you get? If
you still get flashes, it should be real easy to monitor either the video
outputs or SCREEN supply (with a HV divider on your scope) for noise. Then
trace back to power or noise source.

@endnode
@node 11.13 "Excessive brightness and/or washed out picture"

Excessive brightness/washed out picture is often an indication of a problem
with the SCREEN supply to the CRT. May be a bad capacitor or resistor divider
often in the flyback transformer assembly or on the board on the neck of the
CRT.

If the excessive brightness just developed over time, then a simple
adjustment of the SCREEN or background brightness controls may keep it (and
you) happy for a long time.

When good, a typical value would be in the 200-600 VDC at the CRT. The SCREEN
(may be called master brightness or background) control should vary this.

It could also be a problem with biasing of the video output transistors.
There may individual controls for background brightness on the little board
on the neck of the CRT.

However, we are looking for a common problem since all colors are wrong in
the same way.

First, check for bad connections/cold solder joints by gently prodding with
an insulating stick. Check voltages and bias levels.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.14 "Bad focus (fuzzy picture)"

Focus voltage on the CRT is usually in the range of 2-8 KV DC and should be
controllable over a fairly wide range by the focus pot.

The focus pot is usually located on the flyback transformer or on an
auxiliary PCB nearby. The focus wire usually comes from the flyback or if the
general area or from a terminal on a voltage multiplier module in some cases.
It is usually a wire by itself going to the little board on the neck of the
CRT.

If a spark gap (a little 2 terminal device with a 1/8" gap in the middle) is
arcing with power on, then the resistive divider has shorted inside the
flyback, focus board, or HV multiplier - whatever you TV has - and the this
unit will need to be replaced. Ditto if the SCREEN control affects focus
and/or vice-versa.

Using a suitable voltmeter (range at least 10KVDC), you should be able to
measure it connected and disconnected. The ground return will be the outside
coating of the CRT which may or may not be the same as the metal chassis
parts. If the voltage is very low (less than 2K) and the pot has little
effect:

When measured right off of the source disconnected from the CRT circuit, then
the problem is probably in the focus network in the flyback (or wherever it
originates). Sometimes these can be disassembled and cleaned or repaired but
usually requires replacement of the entire flyback or voltage multiplier.

When measured with the CRT connected but reasonable with it disconnected,
then check for a bad capacitor on the little circuit board. The CRT could
also cause this but it is unlikely.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.15 "Focus drift with warmup or age"

Focus is controlled by a voltage of 2-8 KV DC usually derived from the
flyback transformer and includes some resistors and capacitors. One of these
could be changing value as it warms up. (assuming nothing else changes
significantly as the unit warms up. E.g., the brightness does not decrease.)

Focus is usually a separate wire running from the flyback or its neighborhood
to the PCB on the neck of the CRT. Look for components in this general area.
Use 'cold spray' to isolate the one that is drifting. If you have access to a
high voltage meter, you should be able to see the voltage change as the TV or
monitor warms up - and when you cool the faulty part. If it is in the
flyback, then sometimes the part with the adjustments clips off and can be
repaired or cleaned. Most often, you will need to replace the flyback as a
unit.

Focus voltage is derived from a subset of te high voltage winding on the
flyback using a resistive voltage divider which includes the focus pot. These
are extremely high value resistors - 200 M ohm is common - and so leakage of
any kind can reduce or increase the focus voltage. All other things being ok
- i.e., the picture is otherwise fine - I would suspect this type of failure
rather than the CRT.

If you have a high voltage meter, you can measure the focus voltage to
determine if it is being changed by the focus pot and if it is in the
ballpark (2-8 KV typical). Sometimes, the part of the flyback with the focus
pot can be snapped off and cleaned or parts replaced but usually you need to
replace the whole unit. There may a capacitor or two on the PCB on the neck
of the CRT that could have increased leakage as well thus reducing the focus
voltage.

@endnode
@node 11.16 "Bad focus and adjustment changes brightness"

This is the classic symptom of a short between the focus and screen supplies
- probably in focus/screen divider which is part of the flyback or tripler.
If you have a high voltage meter, measuring the focus voltage will show that
(1) it is low and (2) it is affected by the SCREEN control Similarly, the
SCREEN voltage will be affected by the FOCUS control (which is what is
changing the brightness.

There is a slight possibility that this may be in the CRT as well. Measure
the FOCUS and SCREEN voltage with a high voltage meter. If they are identical
pull the plug on the CRT. If they are now their normal values, then a shorted
CRT is a distinct possibility - see the section: @{"Rescuing a shorted CRT" link "11.7"}

Here are some questions:

  1. As above, is there any light on the screen at any settings of the

     there is high voltage? Any cracking or other normal or abnormal sounds
     or smells?

Possible causes of no raster: no/low HV, drive to CRT bad/shut off as a
result of fault elsewhere, blanking as a result of tuner/controller
malfunction, filament to CRT not getting powered.

Possible causes of no video: problem in video IF, video amplifiers, video
output, cutoff due to other fault.

It could be as simple as a bad connection - try gently prodding the boards
with an insulated stick while watching the screen. Check for loose connectors
and reseat all internal connectors.

@node 11.18 "Purple blob - or worse"

Have you tried demagnetizing it? Try powering it off for a half hour, then
on.  Repeat a couple of times. This should activate the internal degausser.
See the section: @{"Degaussing (demagnetizing) the CRT" link "4.4"}

Is there any chance that someone waved a magnet hear the tube? Remove it
and/or move any items like monster speakers away from the set.

Was your kid experimenting with nuclear explosives - an EMP would magnetize
the CRT. Nearby lightening strikes may have a similar effect.

If demagnetizing does not help, then it is possible that something shifted on
the CRT - there are a variety of little magnets that are stuck on at the time
of manufacture to adjust purity. There are also service adjustments but it is
unlikely (though not impossible) that these would have shifted suddenly. This
may be a task for a service shop but you can try your hand at it if you get
the SAMs Photofact or service manual - don't attempt purity adjustments
without one.

If the set was dropped, then it is even possible that the internal shadowmask
of the CRT has become distorted and you now have a hundred pound paper
weight.

It is even possible that this is a 'feature' complements of the manufacturer.
If certain components like transformers and loudspeakers are of inferior
design and/or are located too close to the CRT, they could have an effect on
purity. Even if you did not notice the problem when the set was new, it might
always have been marginal and now a discoloration is visible due to slight
changes or movement of components over time.

@node 11.19 "Color TV only displays one color"

I assume that now you have no other colors at all - no picture and no raster.
Let us say it is red - R.

It is probably not the CRT. Do you have a scope? Check for the R, G, and B
video signals at the CRT. You will probably find no signals for the defective
colors.

This is almost certainly a chroma circuit problem as any failure of the CRT
or a video driver would cause it to lose a single color - the other two would
be ok. Therefore, it is probably NOT the CRT or a driver on the little board
on the neck of the CRT.

Try turning up the SCREEN control to see if you can get a G and B raster just
to confirm that the CRT is ok.

Locate the video drive from the mainboard for the good and a bad color.
Interchange them and see if the problem moves. If so, then there is a video
signal problem. If not, it is on the little CRT board.

It could be a defective chroma IC or something else in the chroma decoder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.20 "Disappearing Red (or other color)"

Problem: I have been given an old colour TV. The reception is good, but very
often, when the contrast and brightness of the TV image is low (e.g. when a
night scene is shown), the red colour slowly disappears, leaving behind the
green and blue image and many red lines.

The remaining red retrace are the giveaway that this is most likely not a CRT
problem.

(If there were no red lines, it could be the filament for the red gun of the
CRT going on and off due to a bad connection inside the CRT - bad news.)

How is a black and white picture? (Turn down the color control).

If B/W picture is good, then the problem is somewhere back in the chroma
decoder circuitry.

Check the video input to the CRT video driver board and signals on that
board. If B/W picture is also bad, then you can compare red and green signals
to determine where they are becoming different. The red lines in your
description sounds like the red video output circuit is drifting and messing
up the background level, blanking, screen, or other setting. Could be a
capacitor or other component.

@node 12.1 "No reception from antenna or cable"

Make sure your source is providing a signal and that the cable connectors are
good (center pin not broken or bent). Try another TV if possible.

Make sure you source select switch or mode is set correctly. Someone may have
accidentally set it to direct video or AUX input.

Are all bands affected? If so, the tuner or IF is faulty. If there is a lot
of snow, then it is probably toward the front (circuitry wise) of the tuner.
If it is just a black screen, then it could be in the IF or video amplifier.

If only certain bands are bad - channels 2-6 for example, then certain parts
of the tuner circuitry are faulty. However, make sure the CATV mode is set
correctly as this affects reception on a band-by-band basis.

The problems may be due to bad solder connections of the tuner shields,
connectors, coils, and other components. Try prodding the tuner to see if you
can make the problem come and go or at least change.

@node 12.2 "Picture is overloaded, washed out, or noisy"

@node 12.3 "Interference when using VCR RF connection"

(Some of these comments also apply to use of LaserDisc players, satellite
receivers, video games, or other sources with RF modulator (Channel 3/4)
outputs).

This may consist of patterns or lines in the picture.

If this only happens on the antenna or cable, it may be a problem with these
sources or the tuner in the VCR rather than the TV. As a test, try the
connecting the TV directly to the antenna or cable.

If it only happens on cable, there may be a (temporary) problem with cable
transmission - contact your cable company.

If it happens on playback of good quality (commercial) recordings, then it
could be a compatibility problem between the VCR and TV.

Make sure your patch cable connections are secure and that the cables are not
damaged - in particular that the center pin is intact.

Try fine tuning if your TV has this capability. If this does not help, try
switching the channel 3/4 selector on the VCR to the opposite position and
try that channel, sometimes one will be better than the other particularly if
one of these or an adjacent channel is active in your area.

If you have RCA baseband video inputs on your TV, try this connection to the
VCR. These should work better in any case.

Confirm that it is not actually a problem with the VCR - try another TV if
possible.

If you just changed your component placement, the VCR or TV may be picking up
interference from another component. Turn off everything but the VCR and TV
and see if that identifies the culprit. Move the TV away from the VCR so see
if they are interfering with each other - the TV may be introducing
interference into the VCR.

Occasionally, the particular patch cable or its length may affect reception
quality - try another one.

If none of this helps, you VCR's RF modulator may be bad or slightly weak.
Alternatively, the tuner in the TV may be faulty. If reception is generally
noisy on all sources, AGC or RF/IF alignment may need adjusting. However, not
all tuners are created equal. Your TV may simply be making the best of a
marginal situation.

A light dimmer on the same circuit as the TV may result in similar symptoms.
If you are tuning up your motorcycle (or automobile) in the same room, this
may be spark ignition interference.

@endnode
@node 12.4 "Missing or noisy channel or block of channels"

If you are unable to receive certain channels or blocks of channels, this is
a tuner problem - could be as simple as bad connections - or even simpler:.

First, check to see that the tuning mode is correct - TV, CATV, as this is
the most common cause of channels 'disappearing'.

TV channels are assigned frequencies ranging from 72 to almost 800 MHz
depending on broadcast or cable channel assignment. To tune over such a wide
range requires splitting it up into various bands even if these are not
actually defined. If you have a varactor tuned set, then you already know
about the Vl, Vh, and U bands which may use separate front-end components.
Even modern quartz PLL synthesized tuners need to allocate circuitry
depending on frequency range. Therefore, if a block channels is not working,
it could be due to a failure of some component related to that frequency
range. Aside from looking for bad connections, resoldering the shields and
connector pins, prodding, pressing, praying, etc. you will need a schematic
to have any chance of finding such a fault.

There is another slight possibility. Some TVs have a parental lockout
capability (pre V-chip) to prevent kids or other unauthorized access to
selected channels. The channel selections may have been accidentally altered.
Check your user manual for instructions on programming this feature. Even on
models without this option, the same internal circuitry could be present but
not normally accessible. A power surge or stray cosmic ray could have put the
set in a screwy mode. Unplugging power for a minute or probably a much longer
time might possibly reset such an anomaly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 12.5 "Loss of Channel after Warmup"

If there is a general loss of picture and sound but there is light on the
screen, then most likely the tuner or IF stage is pooping out.

With both no sound and no picture but a raster and static, it is most likely
a problem in the tuner, power to the tuner, or its controller (if non-knob
type).

If it recovers after being off for a while, then you need to try a cold spray
in the tuner/controller to identify the component that is failing. Take
appropriate safety precautions while working in there!

If it stays broken, then most likely some component in the tuner, its
controller, or its power supply as failed. There is a slight chance that it
could be a bad solder connection - I have seen these in the tuner modules of
RCAs on several occasions (and many other manufacturers - apparently not a
solved manufacturing problem even after 40+ years!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 12.6 "Channel tuning drifts as set warms up"

This may be a slight drift - like someone is messing with the fine tuning or
such a substantial change in tuning frequency that the channels go by as
though you are surfing.

Possible causes depend on tuner type:

  1. Quartz tuner (10 button direct access digital synthesizer) - For a
     slight drift, a component is probably changing value, possibly the
     crystal in the reference oscillator. For gross changes - flipping
     through channels - it is more likely to be a digital control problem -
     the microcontroller is misdirecting the synthesizer to change frequency.

  2. Varactor tuner (buttons but not direct channel access) - If only a
     single pushbutton selection is the problem, the the varactor tuning
     diode for that button is probably changing capacitance. If all channels
     in a band (Vl, Vh, U) are having a problem, it is more likely to be a
     drifting D/A or faulty AFT (Automatic Fine Tuning) circuit or power
     supply.

  3. Turret or switch tuner (Knobs) - A component like a capacitor is
     changing value.

You will have to get in there with a heat gun or cold spray and track it down
the old fashioned way. At least, the problem is almost certainly localized to
the tuner box (and possibly the controller if applicable).

As noted, gradual slight changes in tuning are likely due to frequency
determining components drifting.

Uncontrolled channel surfing is probably a logic problem. For the quartz
tuner, this could still be marginal connections causing the microprocessor to
misdirect the synthesizer to change channels.

For the latter case, particularly, the cause may still be bad connections
resulting in loss of channel memory and/or erratic behavior.

@node 12.7 "Noise in picture and sound due to bright scene"

When a bright scene comes, the screen flashes and there is a lot of noise in
the sound. When a dark scene comes, there is no flash or noise. Changing
channel does not help. The noise persists even when the sound is muted.

(The following is from: Lattuca@Midwest.net (Sam Lattuca))

When the video detector level is adjusted too high, you will get noise in the
sound while screen contains a lot of white information (i.e. letters) but
won't when only dark scenes are present. The video level adjust is usually a
small coil normally located near the IF section. Since your set is several
years old, this wouldn't be uncommon. It can be adjusted while watching the
picture and listening to the sound.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 13.1 "Picture fine, no audio"

First check that any muting control is not activated. This might be a button
on the remote or set itself. If you have a headphone jack, it may have dirty
contacts as plugging in a headphone usually mutes the speaker.

If the set is mono or only one channel of a stereo set is out, then check for
bad connections to the loudspeaker. Test the loudspeaker by disconnecting one
of the wires (with the power off!) and measuring its resistance with an
ohmmeter (it should be less than 100 ohms - probably less than 8 ohms). Or
momentarily touch a 1.5 volt battery to the speaker terminals - you should
get a click or pop from the speaker.

Next, trace back from the speaker output terminals to the circuit board and
look for bad solder connections or a loose or dirty connector.

If these tests do not reveal anything, you probably need a scope (or audio
signal tracer) and schematic. Or at least the part number off of the chip. Is
the final amp a chip also or just a transistor? Have you tested the
transistor? If there is little or no buzz from the speaker, that would
indicate a problem fairly near the output. If the tuner/if were bad, I would
expect some noise/humm pickup from the low level audio stages. Get the part
number off of the chip. If it is in a socket, check the contacts for
corrosion or looseness.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 13.2 "Weak or distorted audio"

Assuming you are not attempting to play it at ear shattering levels, this may
be due to an alignment problem in the IF/audio demodulator, a bad audio IC or
other circuitry, bad connection, or a defective speaker.

If your TV has an earphone or audio line out jack, try this to see if it is
clear. If so, then your problem is in the final audio amp or speaker(s).

If only one channel of a stereo TV is affected, it is almost certainly the
audio amp or speaker for that channel. Interchange connection to the two
speakers temporarily and see if the problem moves.

If the problem is at all intermittent - try gently whacking the TV - then it
is likely a bad connection - either a cold solder joint or a dirty or tired
IC socket.

The audio amplifiers in newer TVs are almost always ICs and replacements are
usually readily available. If the IC is in a socket, remove the IC, clean the
pins and socket contacts and reinstall it. Sometimes, the contacts on old
socket lose their springiness and do not provide solid connections. Such a
socket will need to be replaced.

If the set uses discrete transistors, it s also possible for one of these to
become noisy.

If your TV is fairly old - 10 years or so - this may be an alignment problem
requiring tweaking of a coil in the sound IF. See your service manual. It may
be possible to have similar problems with newer TVs but this is relatively
rare.

@endnode
@node 13.3 "Buzzing TV"

Do you actually mean buzz - low frequency as in 60 Hz? Or, do you really mean
high pitched whine. If the latter, see the section:
@{"High pitched whine or squeal from inside TV" link "13.4"}

Is the buzz through the speaker or from the inside of the set?

If it is the speaker, then it is a design issue with the audio circuitry.
However, a buzzing that only occurs when the picture has sharply defined text
or graphics, may be an overload problem at the source - some TVs simply
handle it better than others.

If it is from inside the set, it is in the deflection or power supply.

There is a slight possibility that the AC power in your house has some
harmonic content - the waveform is not sinusoidal. This might be the case if
you try to run on the same circuit as an active dimmer or something else with
thyristor control. Proximity to heavy industry could also cause this.

In neither case can you infer the severity of this annoyance from specs. It
is strictly a design (e.g. cost) issue.

The size of the TV is not a strong indicator of the severity of the problem
but there will be some relationship as the power levels are higher for larger
sets.

Possibly running on a slightly different line voltage may change it but that
is not really an option. You could try a line conditioner (not just surge
suppressor) which includes filtering. I suspect it won't make must
difference.

If it is in the audio circuits - from the speakers or line out - then
consider using a (HiFi) VCR for the tuner with an external stereo amp and the
internal speaker disabled.

If it is noise from the TV, then the best you can do is audition various TVs
very carefully to find one that you are satisfied with.

BTW, when I got my new super duper RCA Colortrak in 1980, it had a similar
annoying buzz - even had a repair guy out who behaved as though this was to
be expected. I did get used to it and am not even aware of it today - and
still use that set.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 13.4 "High pitched whine or squeal from TV with no other symptoms"

First, make sure it is not coming from the loudspeaker itself. If it is, then
we are looking at an unusual electronic interference problem rather than
simply mechanical vibration.

There are several parts inside the TV that can potentially make this noise -
the horizontal flyback transformer and to a lesser extent, the deflection
yoke would be my first candidates. In addition, transformers or chokes in the
switching power supply if this is distinct from the horizontal deflection
circuitry.

I don't know about returning a set to a store that doesn't take refunds (I
won't even ask about that!) but assuming that this sound level is normal for
the particular model here are a couple of suggestions:

You do not want to coat the TV as this may interfere with proper cooling, but
the interior of the entertainment center cabinet could be lined with a
non-flammable sounds absorbing material, perhaps acoustic ceiling tiles.
Hopefully, not a lot of sound energy is coming from the front of the set.

Move the TV out of a corner if that is where it is located - the corner will
focus sound energy into the room.

Anything soft like carpeting, drapes, etc. will do a good job of absorbing
sound energy in this band.

If you are desperate and want to check the inside of the set:

It is possible to coat the flyback transformer, but this is used mostly when
there a loose core or windings and you are getting not only the 15,735 Hz
horizontal (NTSC) but also various subharmonics of this. This is probably
acceptable but may increase the temperature of the flyback.

Using appropriate safety precautions, you can try prodding the various
suspect parts (flyback, deflection yoke, other transformers) with an
insulated tool such as a dry wooden stick. Listen through a cardboard tube to
try to localizing the source. If the sounds changes, you know what part to go
after. Sometimes a replacement flyback will cure the problem unless it is a
design flaw. You do not want to replace the yoke as convergence and other
adjustments would need to be performed. Other transformers can be replaced.

Note that the deflection frequency - just over 15 KHz for NTSC and PAL - is
on the border of audible for adults but will likely be loud to younger people
possibly to the point of being terribly annoying - or worse. If you are over
40 (men more so than women), you may not be able to hear the fundamental at
all (at least you can look forward to silence in the future!). So, even
sending the TV back for repair may be hopeless if the technician cannot hear
what you are complaining about!

You press VOLUME UP and the channel changes or a setup menu appears all by

confuse the remote control receiver. Or, someone or something may be sitting
on the remote hand unit or it may be defective and continuously issuing a bad
command!

Assuming this is not the source of the problem:

Check for bad connections - see if gently whacking the TV makes any
difference or triggers the errant behavior. Bad connections in the power
supply, system controller, or tuner, may result in this sort of behavior. See
the section: @{"TV and monitor manufacturing quality and cold solder joints" link "11.3"}

There could also be noisy power, a defective bad microcontroller, or EEPROM.

@endnode
@node 14.2 "Jittering or flickering due to problems with AC power"

If you have eliminated other possibilities such as electromagnetic
interference from nearby equipment or a faulty video cable or problems with
the video input (e.g., cable or VCR) - then noisy or fluctuating AC power may
be a possibility. However, most modern TVs usually have well regulated power
supplies so this is less common than it used to be. Then again, your TV may
just be overly sensitive. It is also possible that some fault in its power
supply regulator has resulted in it becoming more sensitive to small power
fluctuations that are unavoidable.

One way to determine if the problem is likely to be related to AC power is to
run the TV on clean power in the same location connected to the same video
input. For example, running it on an Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) with
the line cord pulled from the wall socket would be an excellent test. The
output of the UPS's invertor should be free of any power line noise. If the
TV's image has now settled down:

  1. Large appliances like air conditioners, refrigerator, or washing
     machines on the same circuit might cause significant power dips and
     spikes as they cycle.

     Plugging a table lamp into the same outlet may permit you to see any
     obvious fluctuations in power. What else is on the same circuit?
     Depending on how your house or apartment is wired, the same feed from
     the service panel may be supplying power to widely separated areas.

  2. For some unfathomable reason, your TV may just be more sensitive to
     something about the power from the circuit in that room. There may be
     nothing actually wrong, just different. While unlikely, a light dimmer
     on the same circuit could be producing line-conducted interference.

     If you have a multimeter, you could at least compare the voltages
     between the location where it has problems and the one where it is
     happy. Perhaps, the TV is sensitive to being on a slightly different
     voltage. This might only be a problem if some circuitry in the the TV is
     marginal in some respect to begin with, however.

  3. There could be a bad connection somewhere on the circuit. If your house
     has aluminum wiring, this is a definite possibility.

     Try a table lamp since its brightness should fluctuate as well. This
     should be checked out by a competent electrician as it represents a real
     fire hazard.

An electrician may be able to pinpoint the cause but many do not have the
training or experience to deal with problems of this sort. Certainly, if you
find any power line fluctuations not accounted for by major appliances, on
the same circuit this should be checked by an electrician.

@node 14.3 "My TV has the shakes"

You turn on your TV and 5-10 seconds later, the display is shaking or
vibrating for a second or so. It used to only occur when first turned on, but
now, the problem occurs 3 times in 30 seconds. Of course, many variations on
this general theme are possible.

Some possibilities:

  1. External interference - did you change anything or move your A/V setup
     recently? Do you have a computer monitor nearby?

  2. Defective circuitry in TV - power supply regulation, deflection, or bad
     internal connections are possible.

  3. Defective video cable (unlikely) - wiggle the cables to be see if you
     can induce the problem.

Note that many of the soures of electromagnetic interference that are
problems with computer monitors like transformers and power lines will not
cause noticeable shaking, wiggling, or jiggling on a TV because the power
line and vertical scan are at almost exactly the same frequency and any such
movement would be very slow.

@node 14.4 "TV was rained on"

Was the set plugged in when the leak started? Any piece of equipment with
remote power-on capability has some portions live at all times when plugged
in and so there may have been damage due to short circuits etc. Substantial
damage could be done due to short circuits.

Otherwise, you may just need to give it more time to dry out. I have had
devices with keypads getting wet that required more than a week but then were
fine. There are all kinds of places for water to be trapped and take a long
time to evaporate.

If the set got wet while unplugged (in a leaky attic or wet basement), for
example, or it has a pull or click knob on/off switch, then give it time to
dry out - completely. Assuming all visible water is drained, a week
represents a minimum safe time to wait. Don't rush it.

Generally, some moisture will not do any permanent damage unless the set was
on in which case you will simply have to troubleshoot it the old-fashioned
way - one problem at a time.

@node 14.5 "TV was dropped"

You have probably seen the TV advertisements - I don't recall what they were
for - where a late model TV is dropped out a many story window on a bunjie
cord to rebound once undamaged and without hitting a baby in a stroller but
then smash to smithereens on the sidewalk once the stroller had moved.
Needless to say, this is generally not a recommended way to treat a TV set!

However, mishaps do happen.

Assuming it survived mostly intact - the CRT didn't implode, you could still
have a variety of problems. Immediately unplug the set!

If you take it in for service, the estimate you get may make the national
debt look like pocket change in comparison. Attempting to repair anything
that has been dropped is a very uncertain challenge - and since time is money
for a professional, spending an unknown amount of time on a single repair is
very risky. There is no harm is getting an estimate (though many shops charge
for just agreeing that what you are holding was once a - say - a TV, or was
it a fishtank?)

This doesn't mean you should not tackle it yourself. There may be nothing
wrong or very minor problems that can easily be remedied. The following are
likely possibilities:

  1. Cracked circuit boards. These can be repaired since TVs usually have
     fairly wide open single or two sided boards.

  2. Broken circuit components. These will need to be replaced.

  3. Broken solder connections particularly to large heavy components on
     single sided boards. Reflow the solder. If the trace is cracked or
     lifted, repair as in (1).

  4. Broken mounting brackets. These are usually made of cheap plastic and
     often don't survive very well. Be creative. Obtaining an exact
     replacement is probably not worth the trouble and expense.

  5. Components knocked out of line on the CRT envelope or neck - deflection
     yoke, purity magnets, convergence magnets and coils, geometry correction
     magnets. These will need to be reattached and/or realigned. Some CRTs
     use little magnets glued to the funnel portion of the CRT envelope. If
     any of these have come loose, it could be quite a treat to figure out
     where they went and in what orientation.

  6. Internal damage to the CRT - popped or distorted shadowmask, misaligned
     electron guns. Unfortunately, you will probably have no way of
     identifying these since you cannot see inside the CRT. They will not be
     apparent until all other faults have been remedied and the TV set is
     completely realigned. At that point, extremely severe purity or
     convergence problems that do not respond to the normal adjustment
     procedure would be one indication of internal damage. Give the TV a nice
     funeral.

If you still want to tackle a restoration:

As noted, unplug the TV even if it looks fine. Until you do a thorough
internal inspection, there is no telling what may have been knocked out of
whack or broken. Electrical parts may be shorting due to a broken circuit
board or one that has just popped free. Don't be tempted to apply power even
if there are no obvious signs of damage - turning it on may blow something
due to a shorting circuit board. If it is a portable, remove the batteries.

Then, inspect the exterior for cracking, chipping, or dents. In addition to
identifying cosmetic problems, this will help to locate possible areas to
check for internal damage once the covers are removed.

Next, remove the cover. Confirm that the main filter capacitors are fully
discharged before touching anything. Check for mechanical problems like a
bent or deformed brackets, cracked plastic parts, and anything that may have
shifted position or jumped from its mountings. Inspect for loose parts or
pieces of parts - save them all as some critical magnets, for example, are
just glued to the CRT and may have popped off.

Carefully straighten any bent metal parts. Replace parts that were knocked
loose, glue and possibly reinforce cracked or broken plastic. Plastics, in
particular, are troublesome because most glues - even plastic cement - do not
work very well. Using a splint (medical term) or sistering (construction
term) to reinforce a broken plastic part is often a good idea. Use multiple
layers of Duco Cement or clear windshield sealer and screws (sheetmetal or
machine screws may be best depending on the thickness and type of plastic).
Wood glue and Epoxy do not work well on plastic. Some brands of superglue,
PVC pipe cement, or plastic hobby cement may work depending on the type of
plastic.

Inspect for any broken electronic components - these will need to be
replaced. Check for blown fuses - the initial impact may have shorted
something momentarily which then blew a fuse.

There is always a risk that the initial impact has already fried electronic
parts as a result of a momentary short or from broken circuit traces and
there will still be problems even after repairing the visible damage and/or
replacing the broken components. This is most likely if the set was actually
on but most modern TVs have some circuitry energized at all times.

Examine the circuit boards for any visible breaks or cracks. These will be
especially likely at the corners where the stress may have been greatest. If
you find ANY cracks, no matter how small in the circuit board, you will need
to carefully inspect to determine if any circuit traces run across these
cracks. If they do, then there are certainly breaks in the circuitry which
will need to be repaired. Circuit boards in consumer equipment are almost
never more than two layers so repair is possible but if any substantial
number of traces are broken, it will take time and patience. Do not just run
over them with solder as this will not last. Use a fine tipped low wattage
soldering iron and run #22-26 gauge insulated wires between convenient
endpoints - these don't need to be directly on either side of the break.
Double check each connection after soldering for correct wiring and that
there are no shorts before proceeding to the next.

If the circuit board is beyond hope or you do not feel you would be able to
repair it in finite time, replacements may be available but their cost is
likely to be more than the equipment is worth. Locating a junk unit of the
same model to cannibalize for parts may be a more realistic option.

Degauss the set as any impact may magnetize the CRT. Power cycling may work
but a manual degaussing is best.

Once all visible damage has been repaired and broken parts have been
replaced, power it up and see what happens. Be prepared to pull the plug if
there are serious problems (billowing smoke or fireworks would qualify).

Perform any purity, convergence, or other realignment as needed.

Then proceed to address any remaining problems one at a time.

@node 14.7 "Setup Adjustments Lost"

Many modern TVs have RAM, somewhat like the CMOS SETUP memory in your PC,
that store all factory adjustments. When power is lost, there is power surge,
lightening strike nearby, nuclear detonation or EMP, it may have put bad
information into the ram and thrown it out of adjustment. There is a way to
get into the service mode (depress and hold a secret button down and turn set
on, special combination of buttons on the remote, etc.) and then use the
remote to reinitialize and adjust the problems out.

HOWEVER, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DOING YOU COULD GIVE YOURSELF WORSE
PROBLEMS. YOU COULD EVEN BLOW THINGS OUT WITH SOME SETS!

The SAMS Photofact manual describes this process - you may be able to get
Photofacts from a local library, or you can buy them from Radio Shack or a
place like MCM Electronics or an electronics distributor.

Example: Sony with vertical deflection problems after power failure:

The following is from (Rob myers, myer3812@nova.gmi.edu).

I think, at least on a KV-20EXR10, you hold down the secret button while
turning on the set. An on screen menu appears, and the numeric keys make
adjustments and select the adjustments to make. I think you use 1/3 and 4/6
or 4/6 and 7/9 to do this. The secret button is a small black recess in the
video jack/ antenna panel. The adjustments you may need to make are vertical
linearity and pincushioning. I strongly suggest you get the SAMS manual
before you start making changes.

If it is not an adjustment problem you probably have a bad part in the
vertical power supply or output (perhaps $150 or less to get repaired???)
Once again, try not to make any unnecessary changes and document every change
you make!!! That way you can go back if you do anything wrong (hopefully). I
think the SAMS manual also tells you how to restore factory settings.

@node 14.8 "TV doesn't work after being in storage"

So the TV you carefully stuffed in a corner of the garages is now totally
dead. You swear it was working perfectly a year ago.

Assuming there was absolutely no action when you turned it on, this has all
the classic symptoms of a bad connection. These could be cold/cracked solder
joints at large components like transformers, power resistors, or connectors
and connectors that need to be cleaned or reseated. By 'no action' I mean not
even a tweet, bleep, or crackle from anything.

To narrow it down further, if careful prodding with a well insulated stick
does not induce the set to come on, check the following:

  1. Locate the horizontal output transistor. It will be in a TO3 metal (most
     likely on an older set) or TOP3 plastic package on a heat sink. With
     power off, measure collector to emitter with an ohmmeter - in at least
     one direction it should be fairly high - 1K or more. Then clip a
     voltmeter on the 250 V DC or higher scale across C-E and plug in and
     turn on the set. Make sure it is well insulated.

      o If the problem is in the low voltage (line) power supply, there will
        be no substantial voltage across C-E.

        You should be able to trace from the power line forward to find the
        bad part though a schematic will help greatly.

      o If the problem is in the startup circuit or horizontal
        oscillator/driver, then there will be something on the order of
        100-160 V across C-E.

        In this case, a schematic may be essential.

NOTE: don't assume that the metal parts of the chassis are ground - they may
be floating at some line potential.

There is also a slight chance that there is a low voltage regulator in
addition to the horizontal output, so don't get them confused. The horizontal
output transistor will be near the flyback transformer and yoke connector.

@node 14.9 "Older TVs with multiple intermittent problems"

If the set is say, a GE, with a manufacturing date around 1980, it is
possible you have one of those circuit boards best described as bad solder
joints held together with a little copper. In this case, prodding may get the
set started. The circuit boards in these sets were double sided using what
were called 'rivlets' for vias. The rivlets were relatively massive -
literally little copper rivets - and they were not adequately heated during
assembly so there were bucketloads of cold solder joints that showed up
during middle age. I repaired one of these by literally resoldering top and
bottom of every one of the darn things with a high wattage iron.

@node 14.10 "TV has burning smell"

Assuming there are no other symptoms:

If this appears after extended operation - an hour or more - it may just be a
build up of dust, dirt, and grime over the years. After understanding the
safety info, some careful vacuuming inside may help. Just don't be tempted to
turn any screws or adjustments!

Dust is attracted to the high voltage section in particular - even the front
faceplate of the CRT collects a lot and should be wiped with a damp cloth
from time to time.

If the symptoms develop quickly - in a few minutes or less, then there could
still be a dust problem - a power resistor may be heating a wad of it but
other possibilities need to be considered.

If not dust, then probably in the power supply but realize that TVs don't
have a nice metal case labeled 'power supply'. It is just a bunch of stuff
scattered around the main board. Without identifying the part that is
heating, a diagnosis is tough especially if the set really does work fine
otherwise. However, if a series regulator were faulty and putting out too
much voltage, the set could appear to work properly but in fact have
excessive power dissipation in certain components. If cleaning the dust does
not solve the problem, you will probably need a schematic to identify the
correct voltages.

@node 14.11 "Revival of dead or tired remote control units"

There are two types of problems with hand held remote controls: they have
legs of their own and they get abused or forgotten. I cannot help you with
walking remotes.

Where response is intermittent or the reliable operating distance is reduced,
first check the batteries and battery contacts. If some buttons are
intermittent or dead, than the most likely cause is dirty or worn contacts
under the rubber buttons or on the circuit board.

If there is no response to any functions by the TV or VCR, verify that any
mode switches are set correctly (on both the remote and the TV or VCR).
Unplug the TV or VCR for 30 seconds (not just power off, unplug). This
sometimes resets a microcontroller that may have been confused by a power
surge. Confirm that the remote has not accidentally been set to an incorrect
mode (VCR instead of TV, for example). If it a universal type, it may have
lost its programming - reset it. Make sure you are using the proper remote if
have multiple similar models.

Test the remote with an IR detector. An IR detector card can be purchased for
about $6. Alternatively, build the circuit at the end of this document. If
the remote is putting out an IR signal, then the remote or the TV or VCR may
have forgotten its settings or the problem may be in the TV or VCR and not
the hand unit. The following is just a summary - more detailed information is
available in the companion document: "Notes on the Repair of Hand Held Remote
Controls".

Problems with remote hand units:

All except (1) and (2) require disassembly - there may be a screw or two and
then the case will simply 'crack' in half by gently prying with a knife or
screwdriver. Look for hidden snap interlocks.

  1. Dead batteries - solution obvious.

  2. Corroded battery contacts, Thoroughly remove chemical deposits. Clean
     contacts with pencil eraser and/or sandpaper or nailfile.

  3. Broken connections often between battery contacts and circuit board,
     possibly on the circuit board - resolder.

  4. Bad resonator or crystal - replace, but diagnosing this without an
     oscilloscope may be tough. Broken connections on resonator legs are
     common.

  5. Dirt/spills/gunk preventing keys from operating reliably. Disassemble
     and wash rubber membrane and circuit board with water and mild detergent
     and/or then alcohol - dry completely.

  6. Worn or corroded contact pads on circuit board. Clean and then use
     conductive Epoxy or paint or metal foil to restore.

  7. Worn or dirty pads on rubber keypad. Clean. If worn, use conductive
     paint or metal foil to restore.

  8. Cracked circuit board - can usually be repaired as these are usually
     single sided with big traces. Scrape off insulating coating and jumper
     breaks with fine wire and solder.

  9. Bad LED. If IR tester shows no output, remove LED and power it from a 9V
     battery in series with a 500 ohm resistor. If still no output, replace
     with readily available high power IR LED. Otherwise, check driver
     circuits.

 10. Bad IC - if it is a custom chip, forget it! Failure of the IC is usually
     quite unlikely.

     (The following is from Duane P Mantick:)

     An awful lot of IR remotes use IC's from the same or similar series. A
     common series comes from NEC and is the uPD1986C which, incidentally is
     called out in the NTE replacements book as an NTE1758. A lot of these
     chips are cheap and not too difficult to find, and are made in
     easy-to-work-with 14 or 16 pin DIP packages. Unless you have no
     soldering or desoldering skills, replacement isn't difficult.

There are a large variety of universal remotes available from $10-$100. For
general TV/VCR/cable use, the $10 variety are fine. However, the
preprogrammed variety will not provide special functions like programming of
a TV or VCR. Don't even think about going to the original manufacturer - they
will charge an arm and a leg (or more). However, places like MCM Electronics
do stock a variety of original remotes - prices range from $9 - $143 (Wow
$143, for just a stupid remote! It doesn't even have high definition sound or
anything exotic). The average price is around $40.

@node 14.12 "Loudspeakers and TVs"

Loudspeakers incorporate powerful magnets - the larger the speaker, the
larger the magnet. However, anyone who goes ballistic when the mention is
made of a loudspeaker near a TV or monitor, should take their Vallium.

The fringe fields outside the speaker box will not be that great. They may
affect the picture perhaps to the point of requiring degauss. The normal
degauss activated at power-on will usually clear up any color purity problems
(assuming the loudspeakers have been moved away). At worst, manual degauss
will be needed. The CRT will not be damaged. The maximum field - inaccessible
at the voice coil - is quite strong. However, even for non-shielded
loudspeakers, the magnetic field decays rapidly with distance especially
since the core structure is designed to concentrate as much of the field as
possible in the gap where the voice coil travels.

However, keeping speakers away from CRTs is a good idea.

Now, you really should keep your superconducting magnetic resonance imager
magnet at least in the next room.....

@node 14.13 "Should I replace all the electrolytic capacitors if I find a bad one?"

When a bad capacitor is found in a TV, the question of course arises as to
the likelihood of other capacitors going bad in short order. It might be
worth checking (other) caps in the power supply or hot (temperature) areas
but you could spend you whole life replacing ALL the electrolytics in your
older equipment!

Always confirm the customer's complaints first!! Then verify that everything
else works or you will never know if your efforts have affected something
unrelated.

(Original request from rogerj@apex.com):

     "A sweet little old lady has duped me into repairing her old G.E. 13"
     color TV. Wanted me fix bad volume pot..... "oh it has such a good

     Stupidly w/o even turning it on, (big mistake) I begin to open the set.
     After 15-20 min. of travail, I discover that a previous "repairman" has
     glued the case shut!

     Now w/ set open, I turn it on and this picture is LOUSY. Bad color, and
     very poor convergence. But I don't know if I'm to blame for banging it
     around trying to open it up. Also, no horizontal or vertical hold.
     (fixed that wiht a few caps). This thing has probably been sitting
     around for a few years."

Well, you certainly did not kill the caps. Anything that sits for a few years
- probably in a damp unheated attic - is suspect.

Did you find the adjustments on the yoke assembly tight? If so, you probably
did not move anything very much either. She may remember the good picture it
produced before being stuffed away in the attic.

     "Anyway after going through all the adjustments, the convergence at the
     sides is still bad and the horizontal size is a tad insufficient (w/no
     adjustment available)"

Could be that the convergence (including pincushion) circuits are still
faulty - not just misadjusted.

Other things that can effect horizontal size while still giving you a
complete picture:

  1. Voltage to horizontal output transistor low. Is there a voltage
     regulator in your set? The one I have has none. I assume your line
     voltage is ok.

  2. Increased resistance or inductance of the yoke windings. For all you
     know, the yoke may have been replaced with the wrong part.

  3. Yoke improperly positioned on tube neck.

  4. Excessive high Voltage. This is usually not adjustable.

I bet the thing hasn't worked properly in 10 years.

@node 14.14 "Phantom spot or blob on CRT after set is shut off"

Why is there a splotch of colored light at the center of the CRT after I kill
power to my TV? Why does this not happen if the plug is pulled instead? It
seems to last for hours (well maybe minutes at least).

This problem sounds like field emission from the CRT cathode for one or more
guns. Even with the filament off, there may be some electron emission from
the cold cathode due to the strong high voltage (HV) electric fields in the
electron gun. I do not know how likely this is or why this is so.

When turned off with the remote or power button, you are not actually killing
AC power but are probably switching off the deflection and signal circuits.
This leaves the HV to decay over a few minutes as it is drained by the
current needed to feed the phantom spot or blob.

When you pull the plug, however, you are killing AC input and all the
voltages decay together and in particular, the video signal is still present
for long enough to keep the brightness up and drain the HV quickly.

A proper design (who knows, yours may simply have been broken from day 1)
would ensure that the HV is drained quickly or that the other bias voltages
on the CRT are clamped to values that would blank the CRT once the set is
off. If the problem developed suddenly, then this circuitry may have failed.
On the other hand, if it has been gradually getting more pronounced, then the
characteristics of the CRT or other circuitry may have changed with age.

It may not be worth doing anything to 'fix' this unless the splotch is so
bright (more so than normal video and for an extended time) that CRT phosphor
damage could result. On the other hand, It may provide for some interesting
conversation at your next party.

@node 14.15 "Disposing of dead TVs (CRTs and charged HV capacitors)"

I don't know what the law says, but for safety, here is my recommendation:

Treat the CRT with respect - the implosion hazard should not be minimized. A
large CRT will have over 10 tons of air pressure attempting to crush it. Wear
eye protection whenever dealing with the CRT. Handle the CRT by the front -
not the neck or thin funnel shaped envelope. Don't just toss it in the
garbage - it is a significant hazard. The vacuum can be safely released (let
out? what does one do with a vacuum?) without spectacular effects by breaking
the glass seal in the center of the CRT socket (may be hidden by the indexing
plastic of the socket). Cover the entire CRT with a heavy blanket when doing
this for additional protection. Once the vacuum is gone, it is just a big
glass bottle though there may be some moderately hazardous materials in the
phosphor coatings and of course, the glass and shadowmask will have many
sharp edges if it is broken.

In addition, there could be a nice surprise awaiting anyone disconnecting the
HV wire - that CRT capacitance can hold a charge for quite a while. Since it
is being scrapped, a screwdriver under the suction cap HV connector should
suffice.

The main power supply filter caps should have discharged on their own after
any reasonable length of time (measured in terms of minutes, not days or
years).

Of course around here, TVs are just tossed intact which is fortunate for
scavengers like me who would not be happy at all with pre-safed TVs!

@node 15.1 "An informal history of X-ray protection"

(The following is from: Marty).

Most of the old tube type color TV sets used a shunt HV regulator tube,
usually a 6BK4. If it failed, or some component in the HV circuit failed, the
high voltage, normally 25KV, could go up to 35KV or more, causing some X-Ray
leakage from the CRT. In the early 70s when news of this radiation scare was
first announced, there was a public outcry to immediately fix the problem.
The  feds hastily imposed a requirement on manufacturers of TV sets to
somehow  render a TV set "unwatchable" if the HV exceeded rated limits.

The manufacturers first response was to follow the letter of the law and the
first "HEW" circuit simply blanked the video when the HV exceeded a setpoint
to make the set "unwatchable".

It was quickly noticed that the HV was not turned off with this circuit and
the CRT still could emit some radiation. Many TV sets with this feature were
left on so the consumer could listen to the sound, so the feds tightened the
requirement.

By this time new TV sets were all solid state and some manufacturers
experimented with HV shutdown circuits, but most of these circuits were
poorly  designed and not reliable.

Zenith thought they had the answer by regulating the HV with a bank of 5
capacitors across the horizontal output transistor to "hold down" the HV to
25KV. If one capacitor opened, the HV would only rise about 2KV, not a
dangerous situation. This wasn't good enough for the feds.

The "fix" that Zenith finally came out with, was a "4 legged capacitor. Two
legs were the emitter return for the horizontal output transistor, & two legs
were the HV holddown capacitor (the equivalent value of the bank of 5 caps).
This "fix" was accepted by HEW and millions of TVs were produced. It worked
so well, that other manufacturers soon followed the lead (Magnavox, GE,
etc.).

Then the worst happened! The 4 legged monsters started failing in a large
numbers. Not opening completely & not shorting out. They sometimes allowed
the  HV to skyrocket to over 50KV. Some of them even cut the necks off of the
CRTs.

Zenith issued a recall on those models with the problem (more than one entire
model year). After several "improved" versions of the capacitor, the problem
was fixed but that recall almost bankrupted the company. Other companies had
failures too, but usually not as dramatic as Zenith's.

Magnavox used the HV holddown capacitor, both single & 4 leg version in
several 70s era TV sets and is a good candidate for fireworks as well.

@node 15.2 "Memory chips in TVs"

(From: Mark Zenier (mzenier@eskimo.com or mzenier@netcom.com)).

Actually, they are EEPROMs. A modern TV has integrated the circuitry so that
the microprocessor that controls it also sets the various adjustments like
vertical height and other characteristics. The same memory that knows what
channels are valid and what the brightness and other user adjustable settings
are is used for factory adjustments that are set when the TV is first turned
on. It's a lot cheaper to use the remote control signals that are already
there than add a handful of trimmer resistors.

For service purposes there is often a magic key sequence used with your
remote control to access a service page in the on screen display than can
change these. Since you can easily set something that could fry the various
high power deflection circuits, getting a little too curious can void your
warranty, and toast your set.

@node 15.3 "Tony's notes on setting convergence on delta gun CRTs"

(This section from: ard12@eng.cam.ac.uk (A.R. Duell))

The older delta-gun tubes (3 guns in a triangle, not in a line) can give
EXCELLENT pictures, with very good convergence, provided:

  1. You've set those 20-or-so presets correctly - a right pain as they
     interact to some extent.

  2. The CRT is set up in the final position - this type of tube is more
     sensitive to external fields than the PIL type.

Both my delta-gun sets (a B&O 3200 chassis and a Barco CDCT2/51) have very
clearly set out and labeled convergence panels, and you don't need a service
manual to do them. The instructions in the Barco manual are something like:

"Apply crosshatch, and adjust the controls on the convergence board in the
numbered order to converge the picture. The diagrams by each control show the
effect".

Here's a very quick guide to delta gun convergence where the settings are
done using various adjustments on the neck of the CRT (if you don't have a
service manual but do know what each control does, and where they all are -
otherwise, follow the instructions in the service manual --- sam):

  1. Apply a white crosshatch or dot pattern to the set. Don't try and
     converge on anything else - you'll go insane. It's useful to be able to
     switch between those 2 patterns.

  2. Before you start, set the height, width, linearity, pincushion, etc.
     They will interact with the convergence. Also check PSU voltages, and
     the EHT voltage if it's adjustable. That's where you do need a service
     manual, I guess.

  3. Turn off the blue gun using the A1 switch, and use the red and green
     static radial controls to get a yellow crosshatch in the middle of the
     screen. These controls may be electrical presets, or may be movable
     magnets on the radial convergence yoke (the Y-shaped think behind the
     deflection yoke).

  4. Turn on the blue gun and use the 2 blue static controls (radial and
     lateral) to align the blue and yellow crosshatches at the center of the
     screen. Some manufacturers recommend turning off the green gun when
     doing this, and aligning red with blue (using *only* the blue controls,
     of course), but I prefer to align blue with yellow, as it gives a check
     on the overall convergence of the tube.

  5. Turn off the blue gun again. Now the fun starts - dynamic convergence.
     The first adjustments align the red and green crosshatches near the
     edges - I normally do the top and bottom first. There will be 2 controls
     for this, either a top and a bottom, or a shift and a linearity. The
     second type is a PAIN to do, as it's not uncommon for it to affect the
     static convergence.

  6. Getting the red and green verticals aligned near the edges is a similar
     process.

  7. You now have (hopefully) a yellow crosshatch over the entire screen.

  8. Now to align the blue. This is a lot worse, although the principle is
     the same. Turn on the blue gun again, and check the static (center)
     convergence

  9. To align the blue lines with the yellow ones, you'll find not only shift
     controls, but also slope controls. Use the shift controls to align the
     centers of the lines and the slope controls to get the endpoints right.
     These interact to some extent. You'll need to fiddle with the controls
     for a bit to work out what they do, even if you have the manual.

The convergence over the entire screen should now be good....

A word of warning here... The purity is set by ring magnets on almost all
colour CRTs, but on PIL tubes, there are other ring magnets as well - like
static convergence. Make sure you know what you are adjusting.

@node 15.4 "Saga and general setup for large CRT TVs"

(Responses from: Tony (ard12@eng.cam.ac.uk), panic from V.K.)

     "I'm having problem(s) with a brand new 40" Mitsubishi tube (direct
     view) TV. I'm writing this with hopes of getting some basic information
     so that the dealer doesn't bamboozle me.

     From first viewing (5 minutes after the delivery man departed). I
     noticed a discoloration patch in the top right hand corner (purple when
     the background is blue/greenish when background is white)."

As you probably know, a colour TV produces a red picture, a green picture and
a blue picture on the screen at the same time. You eyes interpret that as a
coloured picture. If you look at (a normal, non-projection) TV screen through
a magnifying lens, you should be able to see red, green and blue dots, and no
other colours.

Now, there are 3 basic adjustments to getting a good colour picture :

  1. Purity. This means that the red picture is only red, the green picture
     only green, etc. This is the one that needs setting up on your set - you
     have a purity problem

  2. Convergence. This means that the 3 pictures line up over the entire
     screen (or as much of it as possible). If this one is wrong, you'll see
     coloured fringes around objects in the picture.

  3. Grey scale. This sets the overall colour of the picture - it means that
     white is really white, etc. It varies the relative intensities of the
     red, green and blue pictures.

     "I called the store in a panic and they calmly told me to press the
     "degauss" button to eliminate the problem (which I quickly learned was
     spurious magnetization, caused perhaps by storage near a speaker in the
     warehouse?). Result? Better but not cured."

Yes, spurious magnetization (or more correctly a different magnetic field
around the tube from the one present when it was set up) will cause purity
problems.

     "The next day I visited the store, and the manager said (again) that
     this was an easily fixable problem, requiring a few waves of a
     degaussing coil. To appease me, he sends the salesman home with me with
     small (1 foot diameter) coil in tow. Salesman (boy, actually) waves the
     coil in front of and around set and can't seem to perfectly"

Argh... Here's what should have been done IMHO.

  1. The set should have been degaussed (a fancy word for demagnetized).

  2. They should have connected a 'pattern generator' to the set. This is a
     piece of equipment that generates various test signals. They should have
     selected 'red raster' (which will appear to you as a pure red screen),
     and set up the purity adjustments on that. You should ask to see the
     pure red raster (and pure green and pure blue if the generator will
     allow it), and make sure there are no strange-coloured patches. If you
     like, you can examine the screen through a magnifying lens to check that
     there are no dots of other colours appearing - I do that when I'm
     setting up a new TV or monitor.

  3. They should then have displayed a 'cross hatch' on the screen. This is a
     grid of white vertical and horizontal lines. Convergence errors are
     shown by the lines splitting into 2 or more colours (normally one of the
     'primary colours' - red, green, or blue, and its complementary colour
     (cyan, magenta, and yellow)). Note, however, that it's VERY difficult or
     even impossible to get perfect convergence over the entire screen on a
     modern tube, and that you'll not notice small errors near the corners on
     a TV screen. Note that some engineers prefer to set up the convergence
     on some other type of display (dots, for example), but you should at
     least be able to see a cross hatch pattern (all pattern generators
     provide that one)

  4. They should have then displayed a 'grey scale' test display. This is a
     pattern of vertical grey bars of different brightnesses, from black to
     white. They should all have been a neutral grey, without colouration.

Note that convergence and purity interact to some extent, and thus if either
is adjusted, both must be checked (and rechecked). Grey scale adjustments
interact with nothing else.

I would want to see the set on a pattern generator (at least the patterns
I've mentioned above) and identify the problems.

     "To demagnetize the TV, he says that a large coil is required, that
     encompasses the whole unit; service rep will 'be in touch'."

I've never heard of that - the correct procedure is to wipe the coil around
the front, top, sides and bottom NOT the back and then move it 2-3m from the
set before turning it off. It doesn't matter whether the set is on or off for
this, btw. I've not heard of putting a large coil round the entire set. (See
the section: @{"Degaussing (demagnetizing) CRTs" link "4.4"}

     "After the sales boy leaves, I could SWEAR that the picture quality in
     general is decreased, with people (especially their extremities like
     lips and ears) appearing pinker than before, and also more general
     interference (fringes/noise) noticeable."

The convergence and purity are set by ring magnets on the neck of the tube.
It's possible that the degaussing procedure has slightly demagnetized these,
and if so, the whole set will need to be set up. Similarly, if any part of
the set was magnetized at the factory, then the adjustments may have been set
up to compensate, and then after demagnetization, they'll need to be reset.

     "So my questions are these. Can the original problem truly be FIXED with
     proper sized coil and application?"

I don't think the size of the coil will make any difference. I would want to
see that set on a pattern generator, so I could be SURE as to what the
problems are. If the dealers don't have a pattern generator, then they're not
fit to be fixing TVs IMHO.

     "Could I be imagining that the waving of the small coil degraded the
     picture quality?"

It's possible, but fairly unlikely. See above

     "Should I demand replacement to a new set? Can I legally ask for this,
     or is it like a new car...you own it, now you deal with the service guys
     forever."

I don't know US law, but in the UK, if a product is defective, you can demand
a refund of the money paid (not a replacement or a repair, a refund). IMHO, a
TV with incorrect colours is defective...

@node 15.5 "About Instant On TVs"

Most TVs built since, say, 1980 have only the microcontroller powered from a
small transformer when the set is off. This permits the remote control or
front panel pushbutton to switch the set on. This circuitry should be no more
prone to catastrophic failure than what is in a VCR or digital clock.

Historically, there were 'instant on' TVs which kept a substantial portion of
their circuitry live all the time - especially those using vacuum tubes in at
least part of the circuitry (other than the CRT). In these, there was a lot
more to fail. Those tubes would continue to change their characteristics for
many minutes when warming up. Circuits were also much more touchy - remember
all that constant tweaking! Thus, it made sense from the users's perspective
to eliminate the warmup period and keep those tubes toasty all the time.

In modern solid state TVs, the only component to really need a warmup period
is the CRT. All this means is that you have to wait 20 seconds for the
picture to appear.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 15.6 "Can I add an S-Video input to my TV or VCR?"

Possibly, but why bother? You will most likely be limited by the TV or VCR's
circuitry anyhow.

All S-Video means is:

  1. A special connector
  2. Separate luminance (Y)
  3. Chrominance (C)

rather than composite video.

In a VCR, you will need to bypass the input circuitry and get to the place
where Y and C are separate. This may or may not be possible depending on its
design.

In a TV, they may never be separate and you will need to substitute your own
circuitry for the chroma demodulator.

It is probably not worth it as you will likely not gain much in picture
quality but if you really are determined, a schematic will be essential in
either case.

If all you want to do is allow for an S-video input, there are single chips
which will combine the Y and C into a normal composite video signal.

Also, see the section:
@{"How do I add A/V inputs to a TV which does not have them built in?" link "15.7"}
since there may be safety implications in the case of adding S-Video to a TV
without any A/V jacks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 15.7 "How do I add A/V inputs to a TV which does not have them built in?"

The place to do this is after the video and audio IF where baseband signals
are normally separate. Depending on the model of TV, this may be trivial to
impossible - or a serious safety hazard.

Trivial: many low-end models use the same chassis (read this: circuit board)
as the high end A/V receivers. Either there will be some parts missing, a
cable connection to the missing A/V panel, or a missing auxiliary board which
would have the A/V interface and jacks. If this is the case with your model,
then it should be straightforward and safe to tap into the circuits at that
point.

If, on the other hand, everything is crammed onto a single circuit board with
no evidence of A/V signals, it may be very difficult as suitable tap-in
points may simply not be available.

Hazardous: many TVs have circuitry which is not isolated from the AC line. If
this is the case with your set, then it may be more trouble than it is worth
to provide the essential isolation barrier between the TV and your external
A/V equipment.

Unless you intend to always use the direct A/V inputs and forgo the tuner,
you will need some way of selecting between them - a switch or relay. This
could be manual - you push a button or flip a switch - or automatic. There
are all kinds of ways to doing the detection - mechanical, checking for a low
impedance connection, looking for a signal, using a switch, etc.

You will need a schematic - don't attempt this without one (for safety, if no
other reason).

@node 15.8 "Turning a TV (or monitor) into an oscilloscope?"

This question comes up so often and it does sound like a neat project to give
a defunct TV a second life. Don't expect to end up with a Tek 465 on the
cheap when you are done. However, it could be a fun learning experience.

You will be severely limited in the performance of such a scope. TVs and
monitors are designed to operate at a very narrow range of horizontal scan
rates and the high voltage is usually derived from the horizontal deflection.
So, you would need to retain the original deflection system for this purpose
at least.

  1. You will need to disconnect the defection yoke from the horizontal and
     vertical deflection circuits of the TV or monitor without killing the
     HV. (also, doing all this without killing yourself as well). Depending
     on the design, this may be as simple as unplugging the yoke connector.
     More than likely, you will need to substitute a load for the horizontal
     deflection coil. A coil from another sacrificial similar TV or monitor
     would probably suffice.

     WARNING: at this point you have a really bright spot in the middle of
     the screen which will turn to a really black spot if the brightness is
     not turned way down really really quickly.

  2. For the horizontal, you need a ramped current source. You are driving a
     non-ideal inductor (the deflection coil) so it has both inductance and
     resistance. Thus the waveform is a trapezoid - a voltage ramp (for the
     resistive part) superimposed on a voltage step (for the inductive part).
     This should not be too difficult. Don't expect to be able to achieve
     really fast sweep. Even running at normal TV rates is non-trivial.

  3. Similarly, for the vertical you need to drive with a voltage (your
     signal) controlled current source. However, if you just screwing around,
     then the linearity etc. for the vertical may not be that important. In
     this case, one way is to put a current sensing resistor in series with
     the deflection coil and use this in a power op amp type of feedback
     arrangement. (You could do this for (2) as well.

  4. There is a good chance that the original brightness control will work as
     an intensity adjustment. However, with some TVs and monitors, this
     depends on receiving a valid video signal. You may need to improvise. If
     you do want to control the intensity from a signal source, you should be
     able to tap into the drive signals going to the little board on the neck
     of the CRT.

  5. Don't expect high bandwidth, uniform response, or any of the other
     things you take for granted with a decent scope. That takes work.
     However, as a fun project, this certainly qualifies. Interchanging the
     functions of the horizontal and vertical deflection yoke (and rotating
     it 90 degrees) may provide a better match of horizontal and vertical
     bandwidth to your intended applications or experiments.

  6. SAFETY: Once you disconnect the deflection yoke from the TV or monitor's
     circuits, move the original circuits out of the way and put a barrier
     between between you and the rest of the TV or monitor. All you will need
     are connections to the deflection yoke on the CRT (unless you want to do
     intensity modulation). With a color TV or monitor, such experiments
     could be pretty interesting but there may be color fringing effects
     since you are not compensating for certain aspects of dynamic
     convergence at all.

@node 15.9 "Displaying a video signal as a picture on an oscilloscope"

I am not sure why anyone would really want to do this other than as an
experiment - it would be interesting one.

If a composite video signal is the input, you will need a sync separator.

You will have to construct a vertical deflection voltage ramp generator which
can be locked to your vertical sync signal.

The horizontal timebase of the scope will be fine for the horizontal
deflection and should easily lock to your horizontal sync pulse or (if the
scope has a TV trigger mode) directly to the video signal.

A video amplifier will be needed if your Z axis does not have an internal
amplifier (you need .7 V p-p to be full brightness range.) Unless you provide
automatic gain control, this will need to include offset (brightness) and
gain (contrast) adjustments. Even if there is an internal amplifier, it may
not have the required bandwidth for the video signal.

However, the overall brightness may be disappointing - a scope is not
designed for overall high brightness. The beam focus will not be as good as
that on a little TV either.

@node 15.10 "Use of surge suppressors and line filters"

Should you always use a surge suppressor outlet strip or line circuit? Sure,
it shouldn't hurt. Just don't depend on these to provide protection under all
circumstances. Some are better than others and the marketing blurb is at best
of little help in making an informed selection. Product literature - unless
it is backed up by testing from a reputable lab - is usually pretty useless
and often confusing.

Line filters can also be useful if power in you area is noisy or prone to
spikes or dips.

However, keep in mind that most well designed electronic equipment already
includes both surge suppressors like MOVs as well as L-C line filters. More
is not necessarily better but may move the point of failure to a readily
accessible outlet strip rather than the innards of your equipment if damage
occurs.

Very effective protection is possible through the use of a UPS
(Uninterruptible Power Supply) which always runs the equipment off its
battery from the internal invertor (not all do). This provides very effective
isolation power line problems as the battery acts as a huge capacitor. If
something is damaged, it will likely be the UPS and not your expensive
equipment. Another option is to use a constant voltage transformer (SOLA)
which provides voltage regulation, line conditioning, and isolation from
power spikes and surges.

It is still best to unplug everything if the air raid sirens go off or you
see an elephant wearing thick glasses running through the neighborhood (or an
impending lightening storm).

Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) are very important for minimizing
shock hazards in kitchens, bathrooms, outdoors and other potentially wet

However, what the GFCI detects to protect people - an imbalance in the
currents in the Hot and Neutral wires caused possibly by someone touching a
live conductor - may exist safely by design in high tech electronic
equipment.  The result - false tripping - is mostly a problem with 3 wire
grounded devices with built in line filters having capacitors between Hot and
Ground but may also occur with 2 wire ungrounded TVs due to the power-on
surge into the highly capacitive or inductive loads of their power supplies.

@node 15.12 "Multisystem TVs"

The question often arise: can my NTSC TV modified to display PAL signals (or
vice-versa). Unlike a VCR where there are substantial differences between
recording of NTSC and PAL, the problem of displaying the picture is much
simpler.

The following assumes 525 line NTSC and 625 line PAL:

The horizontal scan rates are nearly identical (15,734 Hz for NTSC and 15,625
Hz for PAL), so this is not likely to be a problem. If these differed
significantly, then there would be design issues similar to those for
multisync computer monitors and this would drive up cost.

The vertical scan are slightly more of a problem with 525 line/60 Hz NTSC and
625 line/50 Hz PAL. But it is a lot easier to design vertical deflection to
accommodate a modest variation in rates. TVs could be easily designed or
modified to accept either.

The color encoding techniques differ but inexpensive ICs exist that can deal
with either standard. In fact, many are programmable to do either with a
jumper and slight modifications to the external components.

Displaying a monochrome - B/W - picture on the other kind of set is usually
possible if the set has a vertical hold control or enough vertical range.
Modifying the chroma circuitry is more complicated but it should be possible
to substitute a second IC and patch it into the existing video chain.

As far as commercial multisystem TVs are concerned, the real reason we do not
see many of these (at least in the U.S.) is lack of demand. They are
available if you look hard enough and are willing to pay a premium. They are
readily available on the international market.

@node 15.13 "Could a TV be modified for 3D (stereo) display?"

The whole idea of stereo 3-D vision to put the left and right views to the
appropriate eyeball. There are two common ways of doing this:

  1. Use different colors for the two views with color filters in from of
     each eye to separate the views. This is what were often used for the
     really bad (content wise) sci-fi movies of the '50s.

  2. Display alternate views on the same monitor screen but use LCD shutter
     glasses to allow each eye to only see the appropriate view. This
     requires increasing the refresh rate to avoid unacceptable flicker.

The first approach can be used with any TV and a pair of monochrome video
cameras. Of course, true color cannot be used since pure colored images are
needed to separate the stereo views.

Alternating views with synchronized LCD glasses is a possibility but on a
standard TV, the resulting refresh rate would be 30 Hz with a 50% duty cycle
which is likely to be useful only as a short experiment - else your viewers
will likely develop splitting headaches.

@node 15.14 "Displaying TV on a computer monitor"

My general recommendation is that if you have the space, buy an inexpensive
TV - the quality in the end may in fact be better. And, it will be usable
without tying up your expensive monitor and (maybe) PC.

While various convertors are advertized to use a computer monitor with video
from a VCR or other source, keep in mind that if it sounds too good to be
true, it probably is like the claim of a $200 box for this:

OK, let me get this straight - this card/box will enable a 31.4 KHz
horizontal scan rate monitor (VGA) be used as a TV - yes or no? It thus
includes a video A/D, full screen frame buffer, D/A, and all the other tuner
stuff for under $200? I don't think so. A scan doubler - which is a subset of
the above - will not result in a high quality picture since it will display
pairs of lines interleaved. Or does the impressive advertisement leave out
the key requirement that the monitor sync at the NTSC horizontal scan rate of
15.734 KHz (most newer monitor do not)? Or is it a board that plugs into a PC
and indeed does use the resources of the PC including the VGA card and bus?

In any case, get a written money back satisfaction guarantee.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 15.15 "Displaying computer video on a TV"

Assuming this means NTSC:

  1. You need to convert RGB to NTSC - there are single chips for this. Try
     Sony, Philips, Motorola, and others. These will combine the R, G, B, H
     sync, and V sync into a single composite video signal using a minimum of
     additional components.

  2. You need to match the scan rate to NTSC - 15.734 KHz horizontal. Even
     basic VGA is twice this - 31.4 KHz. If your video card can be programmed
     to put out interlaced NTSC rate video then this is easy. If not, it is
     more difficult. If you want to use anything higher res than VGA, it is a
     very non-trivial problem requiring the construction of a scan convertor
     which includes a video A/D, full frame store, interpolator/readout
     timing, video D/A. Unless you are an experienced digital/analog
     designer, you really do not want to tackle any of this.

For the special case of VGA->NTSC, you may be able to get away with just
storing a single scan line since the horizontal frequency is (almost) exactly
twice the NTSC horizontal of 15.734 KHz. A double buffer where one buffer is
storing while the other is reading out at approximately half the VGA pixel
rate should work. With appropriate timing, even lines become the even field
for NTSC and odd lines become the odd field (I may have this backwards). It
is still not a trivial undertaking. Also, keep in mind that the quality you
will get on NTSC will be poorer than the VGA due to fundamental NTSC
bandwidth limitations. Also, flicker for line graphics will be significant
due to the interlacing at 30 Hz. Even this is a non-trivial undertaking.

The requirements for PAL are very similar. For 625 lines systems, the 800x600
is the format that most closely matches the TV resolution.

You can also buy little boxes to do this. Quality is general not great as you
are seriously limited by NTSC/PAL and the VCR. Except for presentations on
existing TV rate equipment, it is probably not worth the effort. This is
totally useless for any serious computer applications.

For professional presentations, modern video projectors are available that
use high resolution LCD panels and real-time scan conversion. However, they
are quite expensive (up to $10,000!!!).

@node 15.16 "What is Kell factor with respect to interlaced displays?"

(The following is from Bob Myers (myers@fc.hp.com)).

The Kell factor - which has to do with the fact that we're often
undersampling an image from the standpoint of the Gospel According to St.
Nyquist - IS a factor in the reduction of vertical resolution, but
interlacing plays a part as well. This comes from at least two factors:

  1. The receiver usually cannot precisely interleave the two fields.

  2. More importantly, there are steps taken to reduce the interline flicker
     which reduce the effective vertical resolution. This includes running
     the line width of the display somewhat larger than would otherwise be
     the case, and in interlaced cameras, discharging the entire screen
     (including the lines from the "other" field) after every field scanned.

Interlace is particularly troublesome on moving images, where you will often
perceive momentarily "missing" details. There was a LOT of discussion
regarding the gory details of interlacing in the recent HDTV debates within
SMPTE and other groups.

The following probably won't help you build such a gizmo but here are some
thoughts:

First, I would not attempt to build any of the RF/cable switching stuff -
there are too many variations. I would suggest trying to control the control
of what you have. With a cable box, this would be relatively easy - just put
the box and an IR transmitter in the same sealed enclosure. If you have only
a cable ready TV, you could substitute or intercept the remote detector
signal inside the set and disable the front panel controls.

Then you need:

   o An input devices - keypad for example.
   o A display - a 1 line LCD.
   o A microprocessor. This doesn't need to be much - just to store the
     'account information' including balance, allowable channel and time slot
     map, passwords. It would need a real time clock.
   o An IR remote code transmitter. This could probably be directly
     programmed by the micro to control your cable box.

Each account would have a means of adding to the balance, password
authentication, etc.

You would have a superuser account for your own watching as well as changing
any of the individual account settings.

Too bad I don't still teach my intro to computer design courses - this would
make a nice term project.

If you have a junker PC, this would be a simple bit of programming (but quite
wasteful of power even for an 8088 based PC).

                    +----------+----------+-----------+---- + 135

Although at first this appears to short out the line supply, when drawn like
this it turns out to be a valid switching regulator:

Q1 is driven by a pulse width modulated signal a the horizontal rate.

Q1 turns on putting 150 V across choke. Current ramps up in choke - more or
less linear until saturation which should not occur. This time increases with
increasing load.

Q1 turns off. Since current in an inductor cannot change instantly, current
continues to flow, now through D2, C2, and +135 load. LCR (R of load, diode)
time constant - charges capacitor and powers load.

It would appear to fail and run away under the following circumstances:

  1. Inductance is too low and choke cannot store enough energy even at high
     duty cycle to supply load. Too high a duty cycle and core saturates at
     which point transistor blows up.

  2. Inductance is too high relative to switching frequency so that choke
     does not have time to discharge (its current) before next current pulse
     - DC current will just keep increasing until core saturates. This could
     only really happen if the switching frequency were too high for some
     reason unless someone changed core material or something like t.

  3. Load is too great due to fault elsewhere.

When attempting to diagnose problems with these types of circuits where the
natural outcome of a fault is for one or more expensive parts to fail
catastrophically, it is wise to either use a Variac to bring up the input
voltage slowly and carefully observe the behavior hopefully before too late
or put a load in series with the line such as a 100W light bulb to limit the
current (though this will change the behavior in various ways).

@node 16.1 "Some questions and answers about TV standards"

(Responses from: Steve McKinty: (smckinty@france.sun.com))

  1. Q: What are the most common TV standards in the world?

     NTSC
        National Television Standards Committee
     PAL
        Phase Alternate Line
     SECAM
        SEquential Couleur Avec Memoire (Sequential colour with memory)

     There are other differences though. Strictly they are just different
     colour systems, but most countries which use PAL have 625 lines in a
     picture and send 25 full pictures/second, most NTSC countries have 525
     lines and send 30 full pictures/second (mostly for historical rather
     than technical reasons). That complicates things.

  2. Q: Who devised them, and when? and why? Are they as old as television?

     The first serious TV experimenting was done in several countries around
     the period 1900-1930, mostly black & white. The BBC started a regular
     service in 1936, other countries followed soon after, but since the
     technology was developing very rapidly there were always improvements
     being made. The BBC started with 405 lines, the US started a service a
     couple of years later with 525, by the time other European countries
     started the technology allowed 625 lines. France even tried 819 lines.

     All those system were black & white, but people wanted to have colour.
     During the 1940's much of Europe was at war, and technological
     development for entertainment slowed down, but in the US they were able
     to continue and devised a colour system which was compatible with the
     existing black & white one.

     By compatible I mean that a black & white TV got a black & white
     picture, a colo(u)r one got a colour picture. No need to make people
     throw away their B&W TVs. This system was endorsed by the American
     National Television Standards Committee, and was named after it => NTSC.

     After the war other countries started to look at colour. NTSC was a very
     clever system, but it had some flaws. Engineers in various countries
     tried to improve on it, and Telefunken in Germany came up with a simple
     modification which improved colour stability. It was named PAL because
     they reversed the Phase of the colour signal on Alternate Lines.

     At the same time Henri de France, in France, fixed the same flaw in a
     different way. His design (SECAM) needed a memory inside the set which
     made it more expensive. PAL gave as good a result, so most countries
     opted for that. France stayed with SECAM, possibly because in the De
     Gaulle era of the 50's memories of German occupation were still fresh,
     and dropping a French system in favour of a German one would have been
     unpopular. Rumour has it that the French government subsidized Thompson
     to make memory affordable.

     Since Britain went PAL, France went SECAM, and the US went NTSC, any
     colonies or dependencies of those countries tended to get the same
     system. India/Pakistan got PAL, Algeria got SECAM, and since the US
     helped rebuild Japan after WW2 it got NTSC, etc.

  3. Q: What's the difference?

     To squeeze a colour signal into the same space as a black & white one,
     and stay compatible, the NTSC designers separated the colour and
     brightness information. The human eye is less sensitive to colour, so
     they were able to reduce the bandwidth of that signal (make it take up
     less space in each channel), 'hiding' it at the high-frequency end of
     the video. That meant they didn't need to make the channels bigger, and
     incompatible.

     To do that, they used the fact that you can represent most colours with
     a combination of Red, Green and Blue. If you film a scene with three
     cameras, one for each colour, then add all the outputs together you get
     a black & white image. This signal is called luminance, usually
     represented by 'Y'. Mathematically Y = R + G + B. (Actually, not all the
     contributions are equal).

     They then transmitted the Y signal just as for a black & white TV, and
     also transmitted the R and B in the extra colour signal. B&W TV's only
     saw Y, and colour TV's got Y, R and B. Since Y = R + B + G, G can be
     obtained as Y - (R+B), so they didn't need to transmit all three.

     To get both R and B into one signal, they use a combination of Phase and
     Amplitude modulation (think of it as AM and FM at the same time). Its
     called quadrature modulation, and works very well, but is susceptible to
     phase changes as it passes along cables, etc. If the signal gets +10
     degrees phase change the colour will visibly change, which is why NTSC
     TV's have a tint control.

     PAL overcomes that by sending R and +B on one line, then R and -B on the
     next. That way a +10 phase shift on one line becomes -10 on the next,
     and small differences will cancel out. PAL TV's don't need tint
     controls.

     SECAM doesn't send both R & B together, it sends R on one line, B on the
     next. No fancy modulation, so no phase problems, but you need a 'memory'
     in the set to save up the signal from the previous line, since both R &
     B are required together for processing.

  4. Q: Why do you need different TVs?

     Mostly because of the different numbers of lines. Its quite easy to make
     one colour decoder which can cope with all the systems, but making a TV
     which can do 625 and 525 lines, 25 and 30 pictures/second, gets
     expensive. Consumers shop on price, no-one will buy a SECAM TV in the
     USA even if it only costs $20 more, since there aren't any SECAM
     channels.

  5. Q: Why do you need different VCRs?
     Q: Why can't one VCR record the same "output"?

     Some can, but like TVs it costs more to make them adjust. The motor
     speed varies with the number of pictures transmitted per second, for
     example. (This is covered in more detail in the document: "Notes on the
     Diagnosis and Repair of Video Cassette Recorder (VCR)" "Notes on the VCR
     Failure Diagnosis and Repair".)

  6. Q: Why did different systems evolve?
     Q: Is one cheaper?
     Q: Is one better?

     When originally developed, expense was considered based on contemporary
     technology. As noted, politics may have been equally important.

     As to which has better quality, its all rather subjective. The 625-line
     system adopted in Europe has better vertical resolution than the
     525-line US system, but some people find the 50Hz field rate still
     produces some flicker. NTSC/PAL/SECAM are all equally capable of
     excellent colour reproduction, but under poor signal conditions NTSC can
     degrade more quickly.

  7. Q: Are there other systems besides the ones I've mentioned? Why?

     Some others, like MAC where the colour and luminance are completely
     separated. That gets rid of interference (ever see the strange colours
     which appear on very fine check patterns?) but is more expensive and
     really only possible due to modern electronics.

  8. Q: Are there going to be more or less systems in the future?

     That is THE question! There are certainly going to be different systems,
     more lines, better sound, etc.

  9. Q: Is there any way to convert a PAL tape to NTSC or vice versa?

     Yes. If the PAL tape has 625 line pictures and the NTSC one has 525 line
     then you normally need a computer which can read in one format and
     re-adjust things. Not cheap, but becoming cheaper, several companies
     offer that sort of service. Some PAL VCRs can do a half-conversion,
     enough to fool most PAL TVs into thinking its got a PAL signal.

 10. Q: Do they teach this stuff in electrical engineering courses?

     Sometimes. Some of it, depends a lot on the course and school.

@node 16.2 "Politically Correct TV Standards"

(The following is from: Robert Rolf).

SECAM
     Used by France and the former Soviet union.
     No tint control. No color control.
     Full socialism. The state knows exactly what color you
     should see, and how strong that color should be.

PAL
     Used by Germany & UK, Australia etc.
     No tint control. A color control.
     Partial socialism. The state knows exactly what color you
     should see, but you get a choice as to how strong it can be.

NTSC
     Used in USA and Canada, Japan etc.
     A tint control, A color control.
     Uncontrolled socialism. The state lets you chose what color you
     see and how strong it can be. They then tax you regardless.

Just another way of looking at it....

@node 16.3 "Variations on a 'standard' - the PAL system"

In the U.S., when PAL is mentioned, it is usually assumed to be 625 line/50
Hz as used in the UK and man other places. However, there are several
variations on the PAL system.

(The following from: Ed Ellers <edellers@delphi.com))

I can think of five major groups right off:

PAL B/G/H
     625-line 50 Hz systems used in most European countries and many
     countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

PAL I
     Again 625 lines at 50 Hz, but with a different sound carrier frequency.
     Used in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Hong Kong, South
     Africa and a few other places I've forgotten.

PAL D/K
     Yet another 625-line system with a different sound carrier. Used in some
     former Warsaw Pact countries as well as mainland China; this may become
     more popular as PAL/SECAM receivers become common in the CIS republics
     and other former Soviet bloc countries, since those countries now use
     SECAM D/K.

PAL M
     This one's 525 lines at 59.94 Hz; it's just like NTSC except for
     PAL-type color encoding. It's used mainly in Brazil.

PAL N
     A real oddity, with 625-line 50 Hz video but a LOWER sound carrier and a
     lower color subcarrier than the B/G/H, I and D/K varieties. It's used in
     Argentina and a few other places.

@node 16.4 "Color television standards worldwide"

(The following is from EDMUNDO, Design Engineer Ten-Lab)

We at Ten-Lab have put together the following chart listing countries and
their corresponding color TV standards.

We are trying to be as accurate as possible, but we need your feedback to
refine and correct the information. We are doing the best we can in spite of
inherent problems such as:

  1. Some of the literature and charts are contradictory; even some books and
     manuals contradict each other more than they agree.

  2. Many countries have changed their names during the last few years.

  3. Some countries have one broadcast TV system, but also receive programs
     in a different system from beyond their borders. This creates some
     confusion about the format(s) used locally.

@node 16.6 "Notes on cable and broadcast frequencies"

(The following is from: kruskal@watson.ibm.com (Vincent Kruskal)).

RF band
     To get the band, subtract 1.25 from picture carrier (low end) and add
     4.75 (high end).

Color subcarrier
     Add 3.58... to picture carrier.

Sound carrier:
     Add 4.5 to picture carrier.

HRC
     Harmonically Related Carrier. Makes both second- and third-order beats
     invisible by making them fall directly on the picture carrier of other
     channels. That is, multiplying the picture carrier by two or three will
     yield exactly another picture carrier.

IRC
     Incrementally Related Carrier, add 1.25 to HRC frequency. A General
     Instruments (Jerrold) catalog said that IRC makes third-order (more
     important than second-order) beats invisible by making them fall
     directly on the picture carrier of other channels. But it is not true
     that multiplying an IRC picture carrier by two or three yields another
     IRC picture carrier. This contradiction has not been resolved. The
     reason third-order harmonics are more important is that oscillators and
     amplifiers tend to generate odd-order harmonics far more than even-order
     ones.

Broadcast frequency
     Add 1.25 to HRC frequency except for channels 5 and 6. For them,
     subtract 0.75. But these are just nominal frequencies. The FCC actually
     has three channel designations for each number as in 5, 5- and 5+. The
     minus channels are 10 kHz below the nominal value and the plus channels
     are 10 kHz above. For example: (next section)

@node 16.7 "Why is the NTSC color subcarrier such a weird frequency?"

(The following if from Bob Myers (myers@fc.hp.com)).

Actually, if we wanted to define the rates to the Nth degree, the important
starting point is the field rate. The NTSC color frame rate was defined as
(60 * 1000/1001) Hz, which is a bit more than 59.94 Hz. From this rate, all
the others in the system are defined. The line rate is 262.5 times this, and
the color subcarrier is defined as 455/2 times the line rate. This is often
given as simply 3.579545 MHz, but the the color subcarrier was actually
derived from the line/field rates rather than the other way around.

The whole thing was done so as to avoid (or at least minimize) interaction
between the luminance, chrominance, and audio subcomponents in the standard
color signal. This could have been achieved by moving either the audio
subcarrier or adjusting the line/frame rates as described above;
unfortunately, the latter route was chosen, leaving us with this very
strange-looking set of rates.

The precise color burst frequency winds up being 3.579545.4545... under this
definition, but giving it to the nearest Hz is within the tolerances of the
system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 16.8 "What is the maximal allowed deviation of the horizontal frequency?"

(The following is from: Peter Bennett VE7CEI (bennett@triumf.ca))

In Canada and the US (525 line, 60 HZ, NTSC), the horizontal frequency is
15,734.264 Hz. The colour subcarrier is 455/2 times the horizontal frequency
which should come to 3.579545 MHz. I believe the tolerance on the subcarrier
frequency is +/- 10 Hz.

@node 16.9 "Informal comparison of TV standards"

Q: I heard that TV in certain part of Europe has more quality in Europe then
here in North America. I'd like to know the differences between the two
systems. Is that why we cant use video tapes from there?

(Responses from: Mark Zenier (mzenier@netcom.com or mzenier@eskimo.com))

The first difference is that a lot of the world runs on 50 Hz power as
opposed to North America's 60 Hz power. In the olden days, before active
power supply regulators got cheap, it was decided that the vertical scan rate
match the power supply frequency, so that ripple in the power supply wouldn't
produce obnoxious visual effects.

So the PAL/SECAM signals have 50 vertical scans per second.

I don't know the exact reasoning, but the horizontal scan rate is close to
the same. 15750 (now 15734) for 60 Hz, and 15625 for 50 Hz systems. My guess
is the tradeoff between cost (50 years or so ago) and audibility for a large
portion of the population.

So 50 Hz systems have more lines - 625 vs. 525 lines for 60 Hz systems.

The second difference is that European TV channels are wider. 7 or 8 MHz
compared to the North American 6 MHz. Video bandwidth is limited to 4.2 MHz
in a 6 MHz channel, but can be as much as 6 MHz in some of the 50 Hz systems.
(NOTE: Systems is plural. There are many different European systems with
incompatible color and sound transmission methods.)

As for the quality, if you move a little farther away, so that a pixel on
each system subtends the same angle, NTSC doesn't have a poorer picture, just
a smaller one.

@node 17.1 "Advanced TV troubleshooting"

If the solutions to your problems have not been covered in this document, you
still have some options other than surrendering your TV to the local service
center or the dumpster.

(Also see the related document: "Sources of Repair Information and General
Comments".)

Manufacturer's service literature
     Service manuals are available for a great deal of consumer electronics.
     Once you have exhausted the obvious possibilities, the cost may be well
     worth it. Depending on the type of equipment, these can range in price
     from $10-50 or more. Some are more useful than others. However, not all
     include the schematics so if you are hoping to repair an electronic
     problem try to check before buying.

Inside cover of the equipment:
     TVs often have some kind of circuit diagram pasted inside the back
     cover. In the old days, this was a complete schematic. Now, if one
     exists at all, it just shows part numbers and location for key
     components - still very useful. Some TVs - as late as 10 years ago,
     maybe even now - included a complete schematic with the product
     information and owner's manual. I have a 1984 Mitsubishi which has this.
     It is, however, the exception rather than the rule anymore.

SAMs Photofacts
     These have been published for over 45 years (I don't know for how long
     but I have SAMs for a 1949 portable (3 inch) Pilot TV - about as
     portable as an office typewriter (if you remember what one of those was
     like) and are generally the best most consistent source of service info
     for TVs (nearly every model that has ever been sold), radios, some VCRs
     and other consumer electronics. For TV servicing, they are
     indispensable.

There are some Computerfacts but the number of these is very limited. The
VCRfacts are also somewhat limited and the newer ones tend to have strictly
mechanical information.

SAMs are often available (for photocopy costs) from you local large public
library which may subscribe to the complete series. If not, a large
electronic distributor can order the selected folder for you.

One advantage of the SAMs info is that it is compiled in a very consistent
format so that once you are familiar with one model TV, it is easy to
transfer that knowledge to any other. They provide waveforms at key locations
and DC voltage measurements almost everywhere. Additional info such as IC pin
to ground and coil resistances are often provided as well. The manufacturer's
service manuals are generally not nearly as complete.

(BTW, I have no connection with SAMs.)

@node 17.2 "Service manuals for really old TVs"

Try your large public library for SAMs photofacts. I found a 3" TV of from
around 1948 at a yard save. There was no problem finding a complete manual
including schematics, parts list, troubleshooting procedures, etc. Someday, I
may even get around to fixing it. All the paper capacitors are leaky (for
starters).

BTW, the case for this 3" TV is about 18" x 10" x 15" and it includes a handy
option: a 6 inch semispherical water filled magnifier. The CRT is an
oscilloscope tube. Not your basic portable!

@node 17.3 "Parts information"

I have found one of the most useful single sources for general information on
semiconductors to be the ECG Semiconductors Master Replacement Guide, about
$6 from your local Philips distributor. STK, NTE, and others have similar
manuals. The ECG manual will enable you to look up U.S., foreign, and
manufacturer 'house' numbers and identify device type, pinout, and other
information. Note that I am not necessarily recommending using ECG (or other
generic) replacements if the original replacements are (1) readily available
and (2) reasonably priced. However, the cross reference can save countless
hours searching through databooks or contacting the manufacturers. Even if
you have a wall of databooks, this source is invaluable. A couple of caveats:
(1) ECG crosses have been known to be incorrect - the specifications of the
ECG replacement part were inferior to the original. (2) Don't assume that the
specifications provided for the ECG part are identical to the original - they
may be better in some ways. Thus, using the ECG to determine the
specifications of the parts in your junk bin can be risky.

Other cross reference guides are available from the parts source listed
below.

@endnode
@node 17.4 "Information sources on the Internet"

Many manufacturers are now providing extensive information via the World Wide
Web. The answer to you question may be a mouse click away. Perform a net
search or just try to guess the manufacturer's home page address. The most
obvious is often correct. It will usually be of the form "http://www.xxx.com"
where xxx is the manufacturers' name, abbreviation, or acronym. For example,
Hewlett Packard is hp, Sun Microsystems is sun, Motorola is, you guessed it,
motorola. Electronic parts manufacturers often have detailed datasheets for
their product offerings.

@node 17.5 "Suggested references"

A good source for technology information is "Basic Theory of Colour
Television" from Philips. Ask this book from your local technical bookstore.

(The following from: (xtarelex@powergrid.electriciti.com))

For a technical reference on the various flavours of NTSC, PAL, and SECAM
used around the world, I suggest:

"Recommendations and reports of the CCIR, volume XI, part 1"

Available from Omnicom, 115 Park St. S.E. Vienna, VA 22180 (703)281-1135

There don't seem to be nearly as many TV repair books for modern solid state
TVs as I recall for old tube sets. Here are is one suggestion which you may
find (or its predecessor) at your local public library (621.384 if you
library is numbered that way) or a technical book store. MCM Electronics has
this as well.

@node 17.6 "Interchangeability of components"

Q: If I cannot obtain an exact replacement or if I have a monitor, TV, or
other equipment carcass gathering dust, can I substitute a part that is not a
precise match?

Sometimes, this is simply desired to confirm a diagnosis and avoid the risk
of ordering an expensive replacement and/or having to wait until it arrives.

For safety related items, the answer is generally NO - an exact replacement
part is needed to maintain the specifications within acceptable limits with
respect to line isolation, X-ray protection and to minimize fire hazards.
Typical parts of this type include flameproof resistors, some types of
capacitors, and specific parts dealing with CRT high voltage regulation.
However, during testing, it is usually acceptable to substitute electrically
equivalent parts on a temporary basis. For example, an ordinary 1 ohm
resistor can be substituted for an open 1 ohm flameproof resistor to
determine if there are other problems in the horizontal deflection circuits
before placing an order - as long as you don't get lazy and neglect to
install the proper type before buttoning up the monitor or TV.

For other components, whether a not quite identical substitute will work
reliably or at all depends on many factors. Some deflection circuits are so
carefully matched to a specific horizontal output transistor that no
substitute will be reliable.

Here are some guidelines:

  1. Fuses - exact same current rating and at least equal voltage rating. I
     have often soldered a normal 3AG size fuse onto a smaller blown 20 mm
     long fuse as a substitute.

  2. Resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, switches, potentiometers,
     LEDs, and other common parts - except for those specifically marked as
     safety-critical - substitution as long as the replacement part fits and
     specifications should be fine. It is best to use the same type - metal
     film resistor, for example. But for testing, even this is not a hard and
     fast rule and a carbon resistor should work just fine.

  3. Rectifiers - many are of these are high efficiency and/or fast recovery
     types. Replacements should have at equal or better PRV, Imax, and Tr
     specifications.

  4. Transistors and thyristors (except HOTs and SMPS choppers) - substitutes
     will generally work as long as their specifications meet or exceed those
     of the original. For testing, it is usually ok to use types that do not
     quite meet all of these as long as the breakdown voltage and maximum
     current specifications are not exceeded. However, performance may not be
     quite as good. For power types, make sure to use a heatsink.

  5. Horizontal output (or SMPS) transistors - exact replacement is generally
     best but except for very high performance monitors, generic HOTs that
     have specifications that are at least as good will work in many cases.
     Make sure the replacement transistor has an internal damper diode if the
     original had one. For testing with a series light bulb, even a
     transistor that doesn't quite meet specifications should work well
     enough (and not blow up) to enable you to determine what else may be
     faulty. The most critical parameters are Vceo/Vcbo, Ic, and Hfe which
     should all be at least equal to the original transistor. I have often
     used by favorite BU208D as a temporary substitute for other HOTs and
     SMPS (chopper) transistors. Make sure you use a heatsink and thermal
     grease in any case - even if you have to hang the assembly by a cable
     tie to make it fit.

  6. Deflection yokes - in the old days, particularly for TVs, all of these
     were quite similar. It was common to just swap with one that fit
     physically and at most need to adjust or change a width coil. With high
     performance multiscan monitors, this is no longer the case. Sometimes it
     will work but other times the power supply won't even be able to come up
     as a result of the impedance mismatch due different coils and pole piece
     configurations. In addition, there may be other geometry correction
     coils associated with the yoke that could differ substantially.

  7. CRTs - aside from the issues of physical size and mounting, many factors
     need to be considered. These include deflection angle, neck diameter,
     base pinout, focus and screen voltage requirements, purity and
     convergence magnets, etc. Color CRT replacement is rarely worth the
     effort in any case but trying to substitute a different CRT is asking
     for frustration. For monochrome CRTs, there is less variation and this
     may be worth a try.

  8. The following are usually custom parts and substitution of something
     from your junk box is unlikely to be successful even for testing:
     flyback (LOPT) and SMPS transformers, interstage coils or transformers,
     microcontrollers, and other custom programmed chips.

For general electronic components like resistors and capacitors, most
