@node 2.1 "Monitors, monitors, and more monitors"

In the early days of small computers, a 110 bad teletype with a personal
paper tape reader was the 'preferred' input-output device (meaning that this
was a great improvement over punched cards and having to deal with the bozos
in the computer room. Small here, also meant something that would comfortably
fit into a couple of 6 foot electronics racks!)

The earliest personal computers didn't come with a display - you connected
them to the family TV. You and your kids shared the single TV and the
Flintstones often won out. The Commodore 64 would never have been as
successful as it was if an expensive monitor were required rather than an
option.

However, as computer performance improved, it quickly became clear that a
dedicated display was essential. Even for simple text, a TV can only display
40 characters across the screen with any degree of clarity.

When the IBM PC was introduced, it came with a nice 80x25 green monochrome
text display. It was bright, crisp, and stable. Mono graphics (MGA or MDA)
was added at 720x350, CGA at a range of resolutions from 160x200 to 640x200
at 2 to 16 colors, and EGA extended this up to a spectacular resolution of
640x350. This was really fine until the introduction of Windows (well, at
least once Windows stayed up long enough for you to care).

All of these displays used digital video - TTL signals which coded for a
specific discrete number of possible colors and intensities. Both the video
adapter and the monitor were limited to 2, 4, or 16 colors depending on the
graphics standard. The video signals were logic bits - 0s and 1s.

With the introduction of the VGA standard, personal computer graphics became
'real'. VGA and its successors - PGA, XGA, and all of the SVGA (non)
standards use analog video - each of the R, G, and B signals is a continuous
voltage which can represent a continuous range of intensities for each color.
In principle, an analog monitor is capable of an unlimited number of possible
colors and intensities. (In practice, unavoidable noise and limitations of
the CRT restricts the actual number to order of 64-256 distinguishable
intensities for each channel.) Note that analog video was only new to the PC
world. TVs and other video equipment, workstations, and image analysis
systems had utilized analog signals for many years prior to the PC's
'discovery' of this approach. In all fairness, both the display adapter and
monitor are more expensive so it is not surprising that early PCs did not use
analog video.

Most of the information in the document applies to color computer video
monitors and TV studio monitors as well as the display portions of television
sets. Black and white, gray scale, and monochrome monitors use a subset of
the circuitry (and generally at lower power levels) in color monitors so much
of it applies to these as well.

For most descriptions of symptoms, testing, diagnosis, and repair, a
multiscan PC SVGA monitor is assumed. For a fixed frequency workstation
monitor, studio video monitor, or closed circuit TV monitor, only a subset of
the possible faults and procedures will apply.

@node 2.2 "Related Information"

See the manuals on "Diagnosis and Repair of small SwitchMode Power Supplies
(SMPS)" and "Diagnosis and Repair of TeleVision (TV) Sets" for additional
useful pointers. Since a monitor must perform a subset of the functions of a
TV, many of the problems and solutions are similar. For power related
problems the info on SMPSs may be useful as well. If you are considering
purchasing a monitor or have one that you would like to evaluate, see the
companion document: "Performance Testing of Computer and Video Monitors".

@node 2.3 "Monitor fundamentals"

Note: throughout this document, we use the term 'raster' to refer to the
entire extent of the scanned portion of the screen and the terms 'picture',
'image'. or 'display', to refer to the actual presentation content.

Monitors designed for PCs, workstations, and studio video have many
characteristics in common. Modern computer monitors share many similarities
with TVs but the multisync and high scan rate deflection circuitry and more
sophisticated power supplies complicates their servicing.

Currently, most computer monitors are still based on the Cathode Ray Tube
(CRT) as the display device. However, handheld equipment, laptop computers,
and the screens inside video projectors now use flat panel technology, mostly
Liquid Crystal Displays - LCDs. These are a lot less bulky than CRTs, use
less power, and have better geometry - but suffer from certain flaws.

First, the picture quality in terms of gray scale and color is generally
inferior to a decent analog monitor. The number of distinct shades of gray or
distinct colors is a lot more limited. They are generally not as responsive
as CRTs when it comes to real-time video which is becoming increasingly
important with multimedia computers. Brightness is generally not as good as a
decent CRT display. And last but not least, the cost is still much much
higher due both to the increased complexity of flat panel technology and
lower production volumes (though this is certainly increasing dramatically).
It is really hard to beat the simplicity of the shadowmask CRT. For example,
a decent quality active matrix color LCD panel may add $1000 to the cost of a
notebook computer compared to $200 for a VGA monitor. More of these panels go
into the dumpster than make it to product do to manufacturing imperfections.

However, a variety of technologies are currently competing for use in the
flat panel displays of the future. Among these are advanced LCD, plasma
discharge, and field emission displays. Only time will tell which, if any
survives to become **the** picture-on-the-wall or notepad display - at
reasonable cost.

Projection - large screen - TVs and monitors, on the other hand, may be able
to take advantage of a novel development in integrated micromachining - the
Texas Instruments Inc. Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). This is basically an
integrated circuit with a tiltable micromirror for each pixel fabricated on
top of a static memory - RAM - cell. This technology would permit nearly any
size projection display to be produced and would therefore be applicable to
high resolution computer monitors as well as HDTV. Since it is a reflective
device, the light source can be as bright as needed. This is still not a
commercial product but stay on line.

@node 2.4 "Monitor characteristics"

The following describe the capabilities which characterize a display:

  1. Resolution - the number of resolvable pixels on each line and the number
     of scanning lines. Bandwidth of the video source, cable, and monitor
     video amplifiers as well as CRT focus spot size are all critical.
     However, maximum resolution on a color CRT is limited by the
     dot/slot/line pitch of the CRT shadow/slot mask or aperture grille.

  2. Refresh rate - the number of complete images 'painted' on the screen
     each second. Non-interlaced or progressive scanning posts the entire
     frame during each sweep from top to bottom. Interlaced scanning posts
     1/2 of the frame called a field - first the even field and then the odd
     field. This interleaving reduces the apparent flicker for a given
     display bandwidth when displaying smooth imagery such as for TV. It is
     usually not acceptable for computer graphics, however, as thin
     horizontal lines tend to flicker at 1/2 the vertical scan rate. Refresh
     rate is the predominant factor that affects the flicker of the display
     though the persistence of the CRT phosphors are also a consideration.
     Long persistence phosphors decrease flicker at the expense of smearing
     when the picture changes or moves. Vertical scan rate is equal to the
     refresh rate for non-interlaced monitors but is the twice the refresh
     rate for interlaced monitors (1 frame equals 2 fields). Non-interlaced
     vertical refresh rates of 70-75 Hz are considered desirable for computer
     displays. Television uses 25 or 30 Hz (frame rate) interlaced scanning
     in most countries.

  3. Horizontal scan rate - the frequency at which the electron beam(s) move
     across the screen. The horizontal scan rate is often the limiting factor
     in supporting high refresh rate high resolution displays. It is what may
     cause failure if scan rate speed limits are exceeded due to the
     component stress levels in high performance deflection systems.

  4. Color or monochrome - a color monitor has a CRT with three electron guns
     each associated with a primary color - red, green, or blue. Nearly all
     visible colors can be created from a mix of primaries with suitable
     spectral characteristics using this additive color system.

     A monochrome monitor has a CRT with a single electron gun. However, the
     actual color of the display may be white, amber, green, or whatever
     single color is desired as determined by the phosphor of the CRT
     selected.

  5. Digital or analog signal - a digital input can only assume a discrete
     number of states depending on how many bits are provided. A single bit
     input can only produce two levels - usually black or white (or amber,
     green, etc.). Four bit EGA can display up to 16 colors (with a color
     monitor) or 16 shades of gray (with a monochrome monitor).

     Analog inputs allow for a theoretically unlimited number of possible
     gray levels or colors. However, the actual storage and digital-to-analog
     convertors in any display adapter or frame store and/or unavoidable
     noise and other characteristics of the CRT - and ultimately, limitations
     in the psychovisual eye-brain system will limit this to a practical
     maximum of 64-256 discernible levels for a gray scale display or for
     each color channel.

     However, very high performance digital video sources may have RAMDACs
     (D/A convertors with video lookup tables) of up to 10 or more bits of
     intensity resolution. While it is not possible to perceive this many
     distinct gray levels or colors (per color channel), this does permit
     more accurate tone scale ('gamma') correction to be applied (via a
     lookup table in the RAMDAC) to compensate for the unavoidable
     non-linearity of the CRT phosphor response curve or to match specific
     photometric requirements.

@node 2.5 "Types of monitors"

Monitors can be classified into three general categories:

  1. Studio video monitors - Fixed scanning rate for the TV standards in the
     country in which they are used. High quality, often high cost,
     utilitarian case (read: ugly), underscan option. Small closed circuit TV
     monitors fall into the class. Input is usually composite (i.e., NTSC or
     PAL) although RGB types are available.

  2. Fixed frequency RGB - High resolution, fixed scan rate. High quality,
     high cost, very stable display. Inputs are analog RGB using either
     separate BNC connectors or a 13W3 (Sun) connector. These often have
     multiple sync options. The BNC variety permit multiple monitors to be
     driven off of the same source by daisychaining. Generally used
     underscanned for computer workstation (e.g., X-windows) applications so
     that entire frame buffer is visible. There are also fixed frequency
     monochrome monitors which may be digital or analog input using a BNC,
     13W3, or special connector.

  3. Multiscan or multisync - Support multiple resolutions and scan rates or
     multiple ranges of resolutions and scan rates. The quality and cost of
     these monitors ranges all over the map. While cost is not a strict
     measure of picture quality and reliability, there is a strong
     correlation. Input is most often analog RGB but some older monitors of
     this type (e.g., Mitsubishi AUM1381) support a variety of digital (TTL)
     modes as well. A full complement of user controls permits adjustment of
     brightness, contrast, position, size, etc. to taste. Circuitry in the
     monitor identifies the video scan rate automatically and sets up the
     appropriate circuitry. With more sophisticated (and expensive) designs,
     the monitor automatically sets the appropriate parameters for user
     preferences from memory as well. The DB15 high density VGA connector is
     most common though BNCs may be used or may be present as an auxiliary
     (and better quality) input.

@node 2.6 "Why multiscan?"

Thank IBM. Since the PC has evolved over a period of 15 years, display
adapters have changed and improved a number of times. With an open system,
vendors with more vision (and willing to take more risks) than IBM were
continuously coming up with improved higher resolution display adapters. With
workstations and the Apple MacIntosh, the primary vendor can control most
aspects of the hardware and software of the computer system. Not so with PCs.
New improved hardware adapters were being introduced regularly which were not
following any standards for the high resolution modes (but attempted to be
backward compatible with the original VGA as well as EGA and CGA (at least in
terms of software)). Vast numbers of programs were written that were designed
to directly control the CGA, EGA, and VGA hardware. Adapter cards could be
designed to emulate these older modes on a fixed frequency high resolution
monitor (and these exist to permit high quality fixed scan rate workstation
monitors to be used on PCs) However, these would be (and are) much more
expensive than basic display adapters that simply switch scan rates based on
mode. Thus, multiscan monitors evolved to accommodate the multiple
resolutions that different programs required.

Note that we will use the term 'multiscan' to refer to a monitor which
automatically senses the input video scan rate and selects the appropriate
horizontal and vertical deflection circuitry and power supply voltages to
display this video. Manufacturers use various buzz words to describe their
versions of these monitors including 'multisync', 'autosync', 'panasync', and
'omnisync', as well as 'multiscan'.

Ultimately, the fixed scan rate monitor may reappear for PCs. Consider one
simple fact: it is becoming cheaper to design and manufacture complex digital
processing hardware than to produce the reliable high quality analog and
power electronics needed for a multiscan monitor. This is being done in the
specialty market now. Eventually, the development of accelerated chipsets for
graphics mode emulation may be forced by the increasing popularity of flat
panel displays - which are basically similar to fixed scan rate monitors in
terms of their interfacing requirements.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.7 "Analog vs. digital monitors"

There are two aspects of monitor design that can be described in terms of
analog or digital characteristics:

  1. The video inputs. Early PC monitors, video display terminal monitors,
     and mono workstation monitors use digital input signals which are
     usually TTL but some very high resolution monitors may use ECL instead.

  2. The monitor control and user interface. Originally, monitors all used
     knobs - sometimes quite a number of them - to control all functions like
     brightness, contrast, position, size, linearity, pincushion,
     convergence, etc. However, as the costs of digital circuitry came down -
     and the need to remember settings for multiple scan rates and
     resolutions arose, digital - microprocessor control - became an
     attractive alternative in terms of design, manufacturing costs, and user
     convenience. Now, most better quality monitors use digital controls -
     buttons and menus - for almost all adjustments except possibly
     brightness and contrast where knobs are still more convenient.

Since monitors with digital signal inputs are almost extinct today except for
specialized applications, it is usually safe to assume that 'digital' monitor
refers to the user interface and microprocessor control.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.8 "Interlacing"

Whether a monitor runs interlaced or non-interlaced is almost always strictly
a function of the video source timing. The vertical sync pulse is offset an
amount equal to 1/2 the line time on alternate fields (vertical scans - two
fields make up a frame when interlaced scanning is used).

Generally, a monitor that runs at a given resolution non-interlaced can run
at a resolution with roughly twice the number of pixels interlaced at the
same horizontal scan rate. For example, a monitor that will run 1024x768
non-interlaced at 70 Hz will run 1280x1024 interlaced at a 40 Hz frame rate.
Whether the image is usable at the higher resolution of course also depends
on many other factors including the dot pitch of the CRT and video bandwidth
of the video card and monitor video amplifiers, as well as cable quality and
termination. The flicker of fine horizontal lines may also be objectionable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.9 "Monitor performance"

The ultimate perceived quality of your display is influenced by many aspects
of the total video source/computer-cable-monitor system. Among them are:

  1. Resolution of the video source. For a computer display, this is
     determined by the number of pixels on each visible scan line and the
     number of visible scan lines on the entire picture.

  2. The pitch of the shadowmask or aperture grille of the CRT. The smallest
     color element on the face of the CRT is determined by the spacing of the
     groups of R, G, and B colors phosphors. The actual conversion from dot
     or line pitch to resolution differs slightly among dot or slot mask and
     aperture grille CRTs but in general, the finer, the better - and more
     expensive.

     Typical television CRTs are rather coarse - .75 mm might be a reasonable
     specification for a 20 inch set. High resolution computer monitors may
     have dot pitches as small as .22 mm for a similar size screen.

     A rough indication of the maximum possible resolution of the CRT can be
     found by determining how many complete phosphor dot groups can fit
     across the visible part of the screen.

     Running at too high a resolution for a given CRT may result in Moire -
     an interference pattern that will manifest itself as contour lines in
     smooth bright areas of the picture. However, many factors influence to
     what extent this may be a problem. See the section: 
	 @{"Contour lines on high resolution monitors - Moire" link "12.1"}

  3. Bandwidth of the video source or display card - use of high performance
     video amplifiers or digital to analog convertors.

  4. Signal quality of the video source or display card - properly designed
     circuitry with adequate power supply filtering and high quality
     components.

  5. High quality cables with correct termination and of minimal acceptable
     length without extensions or switch boxes unless designed specifically
     for high bandwidth video.
  6. Sharpness of focus - even if the CRT dot pitch is very fine, a fuzzy
     scanning beam will result in a poor quality picture.

  7. Stability of the monitor electronics - well regulated power supplies and
     low noise shielded electronics contribute to a rock solid image.

@node 2.10 "Performance testing of monitors"

WARNING: No monitor is perfect. Running comprehensive tests on your monitor
or one you are considering may make you aware of deficiencies you never
realized were even possible. You may never be happy with any monitor for the
rest of your life!

Note: the intent of these tests is NOT to evaluate or calibrate a monitor for
photometric accuracy. Rather they are for functional testing of the monitor's
performance.

Obviously, the ideal situation is to be able to perform these sorts of tests
before purchase. With a small customer oriented store, this may be possible.
However, the best that can be done when ordering by mail is to examine a
similar model in a store for gross characteristics and then do a thorough
test when your monitor arrives. The following should be evaluated:

   o Screen size and general appearance.
   o Brightness and screen uniformity, purity and color saturation.
   o Stability.
   o Convergence.
   o Edge geometry.
   o Linearity.
   o Tilt.
   o Size and position control range.
   o Ghosting or trailing streaks.
   o Sharpness.
   o Moire.
   o Scan rate switching.
   o Acoustic noise.

The companion document: "Performance Testing of Computer and Video Monitors"
provides detailed procedures for the evaluation of each of these criteria.

CAUTION: since there is no risk free way of evaluating the actual scan rate
limits of a monitor, this is not an objective of these tests. It is assumed
that the specifications of both the video source/card and the monitor are
known and that supported scan rates are not exceeded. Some monitors will
operate perfectly happily at well beyond the specified range or will shut
down without damage. Others will simply blow up instantly and require
expensive repairs.

@node 2.11 "Monitor repair"

Unlike PC system boards where any disasters are likely to only affect your
pocketbook, monitors can be very dangerous. Read, understand, and follow the
set of safety guidelines provided later in this document whenever working on
TVs, monitors, or other similar high voltage equipment.

If you do go inside, beware: line voltage (on large caps) and high voltage
(on CRT) for long after the plug is pulled. There is the added danger of CRT
implosion for carelessly dropped tools and often sharp sheetmetal shields
which can injure if you should have a reflex reaction upon touching something
you should not touch. In inside of a TV or monitor is no place for the
careless or naive.

Having said that, a basic knowledge of how a monitor works and what can go
wrong can be of great value even if you do not attempt the repair yourself.
It will enable you to intelligently deal with the service technician. You
will be more likely to be able to recognize if you are being taken for a ride
by a dishonest or just plain incompetent repair center. For example, a faulty
picture tube CANNOT be the cause of a color monitor only displaying in
black-and-white (this is probably a software or compatibility problem). The
majority of consumers - and computer professionals - may not know even this
simple fact.

This document will provide you with the knowledge to deal with a large
percentage of the problems you are likely to encounter with your monitors. It
will enable you to diagnose problems and in many cases, correct them as well.
With minor exceptions, specific manufacturers and models will not be covered
as there are so many variations that such a treatment would require a huge
and very detailed text. Rather, the most common problems will be addressed
and enough basic principles of operation will be provided to enable you to
narrow the problem down and likely determine a course of action for repair.
In many cases, you will be able to do what is required for a fraction of the
cost that would be charged by a repair center.

Should you still not be able to find a solution, you will have learned a
great deal and be able to ask appropriate questions and supply relevant
information if you decide to post to sci.electronics.repair. It will also be
easier to do further research using a repair text such as the ones listed at
the end of this document. In any case, you will have the satisfaction of
knowing you did as much as you could before taking it in for professional
repair. With your new-found knowledge, you will have the upper hand and will
not easily be snowed by a dishonest or incompetent technician.

@endnode
@node 2.12 "Most Common Problems"

The following probably account for 95% or more of the common monitor
ailments:

   o Intermittent changes in color, brightness, size, or position - bad
     connections inside the monitor or at the cable connection to the
     computer or or video source.

   o Ghosts, shadows, or streaks adjacent to vertical edges in the picture -
     problems with input signal termination including use of cable
     extensions, excessively long cables, cheap or improperly made video
     cables, improper daisychaining of monitors, or problems in the video
     source or monitor circuitry.

   o Magnetization of CRT causing color blotches or other color or distortion
     problems - locate and eliminate sources of magnetic fields if relevant
     and degauss the CRT.

   o EMI Interference - nearby equipment (including and especially other
     monitors), power lines, or electrical wiring behind walls, may produce
     electromagnetic fields strong enough to cause noticeable wiggling,
     rippling, or other effects. Relocate the monitor or offending equipment.
     Shielding is difficult and expensive.

   o Monitor not locking on one or more video scan ranges - settings of video
     adapter are incorrect. Use software setup program to set these. This
     could also be a fault in the video source or monitor dealing with the
     sync signals.

   o Adjustments needed for background brightness or focus - aging CRT
     reduces brightness. Other components may affect focus. Easy internal (or
     sometimes external) adjustments.

   o Dead monitor due to power supply problems - very often the causes are
     simple such as bad connections, blown fuse or other component.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 2.13 "Repair or replace"

If you need to send or take the monitor to a service center, the repair could
easily exceed half the cost of a new monitor. Service centers may charge up
to $50 or more for providing an initial estimate of repair costs but this
will usually be credited toward the total cost of the repair (of course, they
may just jack this up to compensate for their bench time).

Some places offer attractive flat rates for repairs involving anything but
the CRT, yoke, and flyback. Such offers are attractive if the repair center
is reputable. However, if by mail, you will be stuck with a tough decision if
they find that one of these expensive components is actually bad.

Monitors become obsolete at a somewhat slower rate than most other electronic
equipment. Therefore, unless you need the higher resolution and scan rates
that newer monitors provide, repairing an older one may make sense as long as
the CRT is in good condition (adequate brightness, no burn marks, good
focus). However, it may just be a good excuse to upgrade.

If you can do the repairs yourself, the equation changes dramatically as your
parts costs will be 1/2 to 1/4 of what a professional will charge and of
course your time is free. The educational aspects may also be appealing. You
will learn a lot in the process. Thus, it may make sense to repair that old
clunker for your 2nd PC (or your 3rd or your 4th or....).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node 3 "Chapter 3) Monitors 101"

3.1) Subsystems of a monitor

A computer or video monitor includes the following functional blocks:

  1. Low voltage power supply (some may also be part of (2)). Most of the
     lower voltages used in the TV may be derived from the horizontal
     deflection circuits, a separate switching power supply, or a combination
     of the two. Rectifier/filter capacitor/regulator from AC line provides
     the B+ to the switching power supply or horizontal deflection system.
     Multisync monitors may have multiple outputs from the low voltage power
     supply which are selectively switched or enabled depending on the scan
     rate.

     Degauss operates off of the line whenever power is turned on (after
     having been off for a few minutes) to demagnetize the CRT. Better
     monitors will have a degauss button which activates this circuitry as
     well since even rotating the monitor on its tilt-swivel base can require
     degauss.

  2. Horizontal deflection. These circuits provide the waveforms needed to
     sweep the electron beam in the CRT across and back at anywhere from 15
     KHz to over 100 KHz depending on scan rate and resolution. The
     horizontal sync pulse from the sync separator or the horizontal sync
     input locks the horizontal deflection to the video signal. Multiscan
     monitors have sophisticated circuitry to permit scanning range of
     horizontal deflection to be automatically varied over a wide range.

  3. Vertical deflection. These circuits provide the waveforms needed to
     sweep the electron beam in the CRT from top to bottom and back at
     anywhere from 50 - 120 or more times per second. The vertical sync pulse
     from the sync separator or vertical sync input locks the vertical
     deflection to the video signal. Multiscan monitors have additional
     circuitry to lock to a wide range of vertical scan rates.

  4. CRT high voltage (also part of (2)). A modern color CRT requires up to
     30 KV for a crisp bright picture. Rather than having a totally separate
     power supply, most monitors derive the high voltage (as well as many
     other voltages) from the horizontal deflection using a special
     transformer called a 'flyback' or 'Line OutPut Transformer (LOPT) for
     those of you on the other side of the lake. Some high performance
     monitors use a separate high voltage board or module which is a self
     contained high frequency invertor.

  5. Video amplifiers. These buffer the low level inputs from the computer or
     video source. On monitors with TTL inputs (MGA, CGA, EGA), a resistor
     network also combines the intensity and color signals in a kind of poor
     man's D/A. Analog video amplifiers will usually also include DC restore
     (black level retention, back porch clamping) circuitry stabilize the
     black level on AC coupled video systems.

  6. Video drivers (RGB). These are almost always located on a little circuit
     board plugged directly onto the neck of the CRT. They boost the output
     of the video amplifiers to the hundred volts or so needed to drive the
     cathodes (usually) of the CRT.

  7. Sync separator. Where input is composite rather than separate H and V
     syncs, this circuit extracts the individual sync signals. Output is
     horizontal and vertical sync pulses to control the deflection circuits.
     This is not needed on a monitor that only uses separate sync inputs.

  8. System control. Most higher quality monitors use a microcontroller to
     perform all user interface and control functions from the front panel
     (and sometimes even from a remote control). So called 'digital monitors'
     meaning digital controls not digital inputs, use buttons for everything
     except possibly user brightness and contrast. Settings for horizontal
     and vertical size and position, pincushion, and color balance for each
     scan rate may be stored in non-volatile memory. The microprocessor also
     analyzes the input video timing and selects the appropriate scan range
     and components for the detected resolution. While these circuits rarely
     fail, if they do, debugging can be quite a treat.

Most problems occur in the horizontal deflection and power supply sections.
These run at relatively high power levels and some components run hot. This
results in both wear and tear on the components as well as increased
likelihood of bad connections developing from repeated thermal cycles. The
high voltage section is prone to breakdown and arcing as a result of hairline
cracks, humidity, dirt, etc.

The video circuitry is generally quite reliable. However, it seems that even
after 15+ years, manufacturers still cannot reliably turn out circuit boards
that are free of bad solder connections or that do not develop them with time
and use.

@endnode
@node 4.1 "Color CRTs, Shadowmasks, Magnetic Fields, and Degauss"

All color CRTs utilize a shadowmask or aperture grill a fraction of an inch
(1/2" typical) behind the phosphor screen to direct the electron beams for
the red, green, and blue video signals to the proper phosphor dots. Since the
electron beams for the R, G, and B phosphors originate from slightly
different positions (individual electron guns for each) and thus arrive at
slightly different angles, only the proper phosphors are excited when the
purity is properly adjusted and the necessary magnetic field free region is
maintained inside the CRT. Note that purity determines that the correct video
signal excites the proper color while convergence determines the geometric
alignment of the 3 colors. Both are affected by magnetic fields. Bad purity
results in mottled or incorrect colors. Bad convergence results in color
fringing at edges of characters or graphics.

The shadowmask consists of a thin steel or InVar (a ferrous alloy) with a
fine array of holes - one for each trio of phosphor dots - positioned about
1/2 inch behind the surface of the phosphor screen. With some CRTs, the
phosphors are arranged in triangular formations called triads with each of
the color dots at the apex of the triangle. With many TVs and some monitors,
they are arranged as vertical slots with the phosphors for the 3 colors next
to one another.

An aperture grille, used exclusively in Sony Trinitrons (and now their clones
as well), replaces the shadowmask with an array of finely tensioned vertical
wires. Along with other characteristics of the aperture grille approach, this
permits a somewhat higher possible brightness to be achieved and is more
immune to other problems like line induced moire and purity changes due to
local heating causing distortion of the shadowmask.

However, there are some disadvantages of the aperture grille design:

   o Weight - a heavy support structure must be provided for the tensioned
     wires (like a piano frame).

   o Price (proportional to weight).

   o Always a cylindrical screen (this may be considered an advantage
     depending on your preference.

   o Visible stabilizing wires which may be objectionable or unacceptable for
     certain applications.

Apparently, there is no known way around the need to keep the fine wires from
vibrating or changing position due to mechanical shock in high resolution
tubes and thus all Trinitron monitors require 1, 2, or 3 stabilizing wires
(depending on tube size) across the screen which can be see as very fine
lines on bright images. Some people find these wires to be objectionable and
for some critical applications, they may be unacceptable (e.g., medical
diagnosis).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.2 "Color CRT resolution - focus and dot/slot/line pitch"

The ability to display fine detail involves many factors including the
resolution of the video source, video bandwidth, sharpness of the electron
beam(s), and the dot/slot/line pitch (color only) of the CRT.

The CRT is primarily responsible for the latter two.

The focus or sharpness of the spot or spots that scan across the screen is a
function of the design of the electron gun(s) in the CRT and the values of
the various voltages which drive them. Focus may be adjustmented but
excellent focus everywhere on the screen is generally not possible (see the
section: @{"Focus adjustment" link "7.2"}

Sharp focus is a difficult objective - the negatively charged electrons repel
each other and provide an inherent defocusing action. However, increasingly
sharp focus would not be of value beyond a certain point as the ultimate
resolution of a color CRT is limited by the spacing - the pitch - of the
color phosphor elements. (For monochrome displays and black-and-white TVs,
CRT resolution is limited primarily by the electron beam focus.)

One of three approaches are used to ensure that only the proper electron beam
strikes each color phosphor. All perform the same function:

Dot mask - the phosphor screen consists of triads of R, G, and B, circular
dots in a triangular arrangement. The shadowmask is a steel or InVar sheet
filled with holes - one for triad. The dot mask has been used since the early
days of color TV and is still popular today. The electron guns are also
arrange in a triangular configuration.

Slot mask - the phosphor screen consists of triples of vertically elongated
R, G, and B, stripes (actually, these are usually full vertical stripes
interrupted by narrow gaps). The shadowmask is a steel or InVar sheet filled
with slots - one for each triple. Ideally, the metal between the slots
vertically is as thin as possible to maintain the structural stability of the
slot mask sheet. This type of tube seems to be very popular in TVs but also
shows up in some computer monitors. The electron guns are in line which makes
some of the setup adjustments less critical compared to the dot mask CRT.

Aperture grille - the phosphor screen consists of triples of vertical R, G,
and B, lines running the full height of the screen. The aperture grille is a
series of tensioned steel wires running vertically behind the phosphor
stripes - one for each triple. The aperture grille - until recently under
patent protection and therefore only available in the Trinitron from Sony -
is found in both TVs and monitors. The electron guns are also in line.

The pitch of a color CRT refers to the spacing of phosphor triads or triples.
For dot mask CRTs, this parameter is relevant in both the horizontal and
vertical direction. For slot mask and aperture grille CRTs, the pitch is only
relevant in the horizontal direction.

Dot pitches as small as .22 mm are found in high resolution CRTs. Very
inexpensive 14" monitors - often bundled with a 'low ball' PC system - may
have a dot pitch as poor as .39 mm. This is useless for any resolution
greater than VGA. Common SVGA monitors use a typical dot pitch of .28 mm. TVs
due to their lower resolution have pitches (depending on screen size) as high
as .75 mm - or more.

Obviously, with smaller screens and higher desired video source resolutions,
CRT pitch becomes increasingly important. However, it isn't a simple
relationship like the size of a pixel should be larger than the size of a dot
triad or triple, for example. Focus is important. All other factors being
equal, a smaller pitch is generally preferred and you will likely be
disappointed if the pitch is larger than a pixel. As the pixel size
approaches the phosphor triad or triple size, Moire becomes more likely.
However, the only truly reliable way to determine whether Moire will be a
problem with your monitor is to test it at the resolutions you intend to use.

@endnode
@node 4.3 "Why is the shadowmask or aperture grill made of a magnetic material?"

(From: Jeroen Stessen, (stessenj@am.umc.ce.philips.nl))

The question often arises: Well, if magnetization and the need for degauss is
a problem, why not make the shadowmask or aperture grille from something that
is non-magnetic?

The shadowmask MUST be made of magnetic material! This may seem to be
undesirable or counterintuitive but read on:

Together with the internal shielding hood it forms sort of a closed space in
which it is attempted to achieve a field-free space. The purpose of
degaussing is NOT to demagnetize the metal, but to create a magnetization
that compensates for the earth's magnetic field. The sum of the two fields
must be near zero! Degaussing coils create a strong alternating magnetic
field that gradually decays to zero. The effect is that the present earth
magnetic field is "frozen" into the magnetic shielding and the field inside
the shielding will be (almost) zero. Non-zero field will cause colour purity
errors.

Now you will understand why a CRT must be degaussed again after it has been
moved relative to the earth's magnetic field. This will also explain why
expensive computer monitors on a swivel pedestal have a manual degaussing
button, you must press it every time after you have rotated the monitor.

The axial component of the magnetic field is harder to compensate by means of
degaussing. Better compensation may be achieved by means of a "rotation coil"
(around the neck or around the screen), this requires an adjustment that
depends on local magnetic field. CRT's for moving vehicles (like military
airplanes) may be equipped with 6 coils to achieve zero magnetic field in all
directions. They use magnetic field sensors and active compensation, thus
they don't need any degaussing function. This is too expensive for consumer
equipment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.4 "Tubes for all Nations"

(From: Jeroen Stessen, (stessenj@am.umc.ce.philips.nl))

CRT Manufacturers actually make different versions of their tubes for TV's
for the northern and southern hemisphere, and sometimes a 3rd neutral type.
These are so-to-say precorrected for the uncompensated field. (Note that the
term 'tube' here includes much of the convergence hardware as well - not just
what is inside the glass.)

I remember when we exported projection televisions from Belgium to Australia,
a couple of years ago. They all had to be opened on arrival to re-adjust the
rotation settings on the convergence panel, due to the different magnetic
field in Australia. Projection TV's don't have degaussing (there is nothing
to degauss), and the customer can only adjust red and blue shift, not
rotation.

Our CRT application group has a "magnetic cage". This is a wooden cube
(approx. 2 meter long sides) with copper coils around each of the 6 surfaces.
With this they can simulate the earth magnetic field for every place on earth
(as indicated on a map on the wall).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.5 "Degaussing (demagnetizing) a CRT"

Degaussing may be required if there are color purity problems with the
display. On rare occasions, there may be geometric distortion caused by
magnetic fields as well without color problems. The CRT can get magnetized:

   o if the TV or monitor is moved or even just rotated.

   o if there has been a lightening strike nearby. A friend of mine had a
     lightening strike near his house which produced all of the effects of
     the EMP from a nuclear bomb.

   o If a permanent magnet was brought near the screen (e.g., kid's magnet or
     megawatt stereo speakers).

   o If some piece of electrical or electronic equipment with unshielded
     magnetic fields is in the vicinity of the TV or monitor.

Degaussing should be the first thing attempted whenever color purity problems
are detected. As noted below, first try the internal degauss circuits of the
TV or monitor by power cycling a few times (on for a minute, off for 30
minutes, on for a minute, etc.) If this does not help or does not completely
cure the problem, then you can try manually degaussing.

Commercial CRT Degaussers are available from parts distributors like MCM
Electronics and consist of a hundred or so turns of magnet wire in a 6-12
inch coil. They include a line cord and momentary switch. You flip on the
switch, and bring the coil to within several inches of the screen face. Then
you slowly draw the center of the coil toward one edge of the screen and
trace the perimeter of the screen face. Then return to the original position
of the coil being flat against the center of the screen. Next, slowly
decrease the field to zero by backing straight up across the room as you hold
the coil. When you are farther than 5 feet away you can release the line
switch.

The key word here is SLOW. Go too fast and you will freeze the instantaneous
intensity of the 50/60 Hz AC magnetic field variation into the ferrous
components of the CRT and may make the problem worse.

It looks really cool to do this while the CRT is powered. The kids will love
the color effects.

Bulk tape erasers, tape head degaussers, open frame transformers, and the
"ass-end" of a weller soldering gun can be used as CRT demagnetizers but it
just takes a little longer. (Be careful not to scratch the screen face with
anything sharp.) It is imperative to have the CRT running when using these
whimpier approaches, so that you can see where there are still impurities.
Never release the power switch until you're 4 or 5 feet away from the screen
or you'll have to start over.

I've never known of anything being damaged by excess manual degaussing though
I would recommend keeping really powerful bulk tape erasers turned degaussers
a couple of inches from the CRT.

If an AC degaussing coil or substitute is unavailable, I have even done
degaussed with a permanent magnet but this is not recommended since it is
more likely to make the problem worse than better. However, if the display is
unusable as is, then using a small magnet can do no harm. (Don't use a 20
pound speaker or magnetron magnet as you may rip the shadowmask right out of
the CRT - well at least distort it beyond repair. What I have in mind is
something about as powerful as a refrigerator magnet.)

Keep degaussing fields away from magnetic media. It is a good idea to avoid
degaussing in a room with floppies or back-up tapes. When removing media from
a room remember to check desk drawers and manuals for stray floppies, too.

It is unlikely that you could actually affect magnetic media but better safe
than sorry. Of the devices mentioned above, only a bulk eraser or strong
permanent magnet are likely to have any effect - and then only when at
extremely close range (direct contact with media container).

All color CRTs include a built-in degaussing coil wrapped around the
perimeter of the CRT face. These are activated each time the CRT is powered
up cold by a 3 terminal thermister device or other control circuitry. This is
why it is often suggested that color purity problems may go away "in a few
days". It isn't a matter of time; it's the number of cold power ups that
causes it. It takes about 15 minutes of the power being off for each cool
down cycle. These built-in coils with thermal control are never as effective
as external coils.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.6 "How often to degauss"

Some monitor manufacturers specifically warn about excessive use of degauss,
most likely as a result of overstressing components in the degauss circuitry
which are designed (cheaply) for only infrequent use. In particular, there is
often a thermister that dissipates significant power for the second or two
that the degauss is active. Also, the large coil around the CRT is not rated
for continuous operation and may overheat.

If one or two activations of the degauss button do not clear up the color
problems, manual degaussing using an external coil may be needed or the
monitor may need internal purity/color adjustments. Or, you may have just
installed your megawatt stereo speakers next to the monitor!

You should only need to degauss if you see color purity problems on your CRT.
Otherwise it is unnecessary. The reasons it only works the first time is that
the degauss timing is controlled by a termister which heats up and cuts off
the current. If you push the button twice in a row, that thermister is still
hot and so little happens.

One word of clarification: In order for the degauss operation to be
effective, the AC current in the coil must approach zero before the circuit
cuts out. The circuit to accomplish this often involves a thermister to
gradually decrease the current (over a matter of several seconds), and in
better monitors, a relay to totally cut off the current after a certain
delay.  If the current was turned off suddenly, you would likely be left with
a more magnetized CRT. There are time delay elements involved which prevent
multiple degauss operations in succession. Whether this is by design or
accident, it does prevent the degauss coil - which is usually grossly
undersized for continuous operation - to cool.

@node 4.7 "Why are indirectly heated cathodes used in CRTs"

Here are three reasons:

  1. The cathode can be made of and/or coated with a material optimal for
     emitting electrons without regard to its performance as a heater.

  2. The separate cathode and filament can be electrically isolated so that
     the filament voltage and cathode drive signal, if any, do not interfere.

  3. The cathode can have an optimal shape for the application. This would be
     particularly significant for CRTs. The spot on the screen is a reduced
     focused image of the effective shape of the emitting portion of the
     cathode.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.8 "Why are there fine lines across my Trinitron monitor or TV?"

These are not a defect - they are a 'feature'.

All Trinitron (or clone) CRTs - tubes that use an aperture grille - require
1, 2, or 3 very fine wires across the screen to stabilize the array of
vertical wires in the aperture grille. Without these, the display would be
very sensitive to any shock or vibration and result in visible shimmering or
rippling. (In fact, even with these stabilizing wires, you can usually see
this shimmering if you whack a Trinitron monitor.) The lines you see are the
shadows cast by these fine wires.

The number of wires depends on the size of the screen. Below 15" there is
usually a single wire; between 15" and 21" there are usually 2 wires; above
21" there may be 3 wires.

Only you can decide if this deficiency is serious enough to avoid the use of
a Trinitron based monitor. Some people never get used to the fine lines but
many really like the generally high quality of Trinitron based displays and
eventually totally ignore them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 4.9 "Scratches in CRT face"

Minor scratches can be removed with jeweler's rouge or similar ultra-fine
abrasive. Jeweler's rouge is the same stuff that is used in the final
polishing of lenses and mirrors so it makes for a fine finish. However, any
kind of scratch deep enough to be felt will not yield to this approach.

Warning: any kind of deep scratch on a CRT should be considered a serious
safety hazard. This may be even more of a concern for modern CRTs that have
'integral implosion protection' - that steel band around the outside'. Older
CRTs used either (1) a separate safety shield - that laminated glass plate in
front of your grandmom's TV - or (2) a second contoured glass panel bonded to
the actual tube face. In both of these cases, the second panel is strictly
protective and serves no structural purpose. Therefore, any damage to it does
not compromise the tube in any way. In the case of modern CRTs, the steel
band in conjunction with the basic tube envelope is used to maintain the
integrity of the overall CRT. Any damage significantly decreases the strength
and increases the risk of CRT implosion.

BTW, scratches in the CRT have absolutely no effect on X-ray emission. X-rays
are blocked long before they come anywhere near the surface and glass has
very little effect on their direction. Any scratch deep enough to have any
detectable effect on X-ray emission (actually, it would need to be an inch
deep gouge) would have caused the tube to implode.

@node 5.1 "General monitor placement considerations"

Proper care of a monitor does not require much. Following the recommendations
below will assure long life and minimize repairs:

   o Subdued lighting is preferred for best viewing conditions. Avoid direct
     overhead light falling on the screen or coming from behind the monitor
     if possible.

   o Locate the monitor away from extremes of hot and cold. Avoid damp or
     dusty locations if possible. (Right you say, keep dreaming!) This will
     help keep your PC happy as well.

   o Allow adequate ventilation - monitors use a fair amount of power - from
     60 watts for a 12 inch monochrome monitor to over 200 W for a 21 inch
     high resolution color monitor. Heat is one major enemy of electronics.

   o Do not put anything on top of the monitor that might block the
     ventilation grill in the rear or top of the cover. This is the major
     avenue for the convection needed to cool internal components.

   o Do not place two monitors close to one another. The magnetic fields may
     cause either or both to suffer from wiggling or shimmering images.
     Likewise, do not place a monitor next to a TV if possible.

   o Locate loudspeakers and other sources of magnetic fields at least a
     couple of feet from the monitor. This will minimize the possibility of
     color purity or geometry problems. The exception is with respect to good
     quality shielded multimedia speakers which are designed to avoid
     magnetic interference problems.

   o Situate monitors away from power lines - even electric wiring behind or
     on the other side of walls - and heavy equipment which may cause
     noticeable interference like rippling, wiggling, or swimming of the
     picture. Shielding is difficult and expensive.

   o Make sure all video connections are secure (tighten the thumbscrews) to
     minimize the possibility of intermittent or noisy colors. Keep the
     cables as short as possible. Do not add extension cables if at all
     possible as these almost always result in a reduction in image crispness
     and introduce ghosting, smearing, and other termination problems. If you
     must add an extension, use proper high quality cable only long enough to
     make connections conveniently. Follow the termination recommendations
     elsewhere in this document.

   o Finally, store magnetic media well away from all electronic equipment
     including and especially monitors and loudspeakers. Heat and magnetic
     fields will rapidly turn your diskettes and tapes into so much trash.
     The operation of the monitor depends on magnetic fields for beam
     deflection. Enough said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 5.2 "Preventive maintenance (PM)"

Preventive maintenance for a monitor is pretty simple - just keep the case
clean and free of obstructions. Clean the screen with a soft cloth just
dampened with water and at most, mild detergent. DO NOT use anything so wet
that liquid may seep inside of the monitor around the edge of the CRT. You
could end up with a very expensive repair bill when the liquid decides to
short out the main circuit board lurking just below. Clean the CRT with a
soft damp cloth and dry thoroughly. Use the CRT sprays sold in computer
stores if you like but again, make sure none can seep inside. If you have not
cleaned the screen for quite a while, you will be amazed at the amount of
black grime that collects due to the static buildup from the high voltage CRT
supply.

In really dusty situations, periodically vacuuming inside the case and the
use of contact cleaner for the controls might be a good idea but
realistically, you will not do this so don't worry about it.

@node 5.3 "Monitor tuneup?"

(The following from: Bob Myers (myers@fc.hp.com)).

Most manufacturers will quote an MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure) of somewhere
in the 30,000 to 60,000 hour range, EXCLUSIVE OF the CRT. The typical CRT,
without an extended-life cathode, is usually good for 10,000 to 15,000 hours
before it reaches half of its initial brightness. Note that, if you leave
your monitor on all the time, a year is just about 8,000 hours.

The only "tuneup" that a monitor should need, exclusive of adjustments needed
following replacement of a failed component, would be video amplifier and/or
CRT biasing adjustments to compensate for the aging of the tube. These are
usually done only if you're using the thing in an application where exact
color/brightness matching is important. Regular degaussing of the unit may be
needed, of course, but I'm not considering that a "tuneup" or adjustment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.1 "Safety"

TVs and computer or video monitors are among the more dangerous of consumer
electronics equipment when it comes to servicing. (Microwave ovens are
probably the most hazardous due to high voltage at flesh frying and cardiac
arresting high power.)

There are two areas which have particularly nasty electrical dangers: the
non-isolated line power supply and the CRT high voltage.

Major parts of nearly all modern TVs and many computer monitors are directly
connected to the AC line - there is no power transformer to provide the
essential barrier for safety and to minimize the risk of equipment damage. In
the majority of designs, the live parts of the TV or monitor are limited to
the AC input and line filter, degauss circuit, bridge rectifier and main
filter capacitor(s), low voltage (B+) regulator (if any), horizontal output
transistor and primary side of the flyback (LOPT) transformer, and parts of
the startup circuit and standby power supply. The flyback generates most of
the other voltages used in the unit and provides an isolation barrier so that
the signal circuits are not line connected and safer.

Since a bridge rectifier is generally used in the power supply, both
directions of the polarized plug result in dangerous conditions and an
isolation transformer really should be used - to protect you, your test
equipment, and the TV, from serious damage. Some TVs do not have any
isolation barrier whatsoever - the entire chassis is live. These are
particularly nasty.

The high voltage to the CRT, while 200 times greater than the line input, is
not nearly as dangerous for several reasons. First, it is present in a very
limited area of the TV or monitor - from the output of the flyback to the CRT
anode via the fat red wire and suction cup connector. If you don't need to
remove the mainboard or replace the flyback or CRT, then leave it alone and
it should not bite. Furthermore, while the shock from the HV can be quite
painful due to the capacitance of the CRT envelope, it is not nearly as
likely to be lethal since the current available from the line connected power
supply is much greater.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.2 "Safety Guidelines"

These guidelines are to protect you from potentially deadly electrical shock
hazards as well as the equipment from accidental damage.

Note that the danger to you is not only in your body providing a conducting
path, particularly through your heart. Any involuntary muscle contractions
caused by a shock, while perhaps harmless in themselves, may cause collateral
damage - there are many sharp edges inside this type of equipment as well as
other electrically live parts you may contact accidentally.

The purpose of this set of guidelines is not to frighten you but rather to
make you aware of the appropriate precautions. Repair of TVs, monitors,
microwave ovens, and other consumer and industrial equipment can be both
rewarding and economical. Just be sure that it is also safe!

   o Don't work alone - in the event of an emergency another person's
     presence may be essential.

   o Always keep one hand in your pocket when anywhere around a powered
     line-connected or high voltage system.

   o Wear rubber bottom shoes or sneakers.

   o Don't wear any jewelry or other articles that could accidentally contact
     circuitry and conduct current, or get caught in moving parts.

   o Set up your work area away from possible grounds that you may
     accidentally contact.

   o Know your equipment: TVs and monitors may use parts of the metal chassis
     as ground return yet the chassis may be electrically live with respect
     to the earth ground of the AC line. Microwave ovens use the chassis as
     ground return for the high voltage. In addition, do not assume that the
     chassis is a suitable ground for your test equipment!

   o If circuit boards need to be removed from their mountings, put
     insulating material between the boards and anything they may short to.
     Hold them in place with string or electrical tape. Prop them up with
     insulation sticks - plastic or wood.

   o If you need to probe, solder, or otherwise touch circuits with power
     off, discharge (across) large power supply filter capacitors with a 2 W
     or greater resistor of 100-500 ohms/V approximate value (e.g., for a 200
     V capacitor, use a 20K-100K ohm resistor). Monitor while discharging
     and/or verify that there is no residual charge with a suitable
     voltmeter. In a TV or monitor, if you are removing the high voltage
     connection to the CRT (to replace the flyback transformer for example)
     first discharge the CRT contact (under the insulating cup at the end of
     the fat red wire). Use a 1M-10M ohm 1W or greater wattage resistor on
     the end of an insulating stick or the probe of a high voltage meter.
     Discharge to the metal frame which is connected to the outside of the
     CRT.

   o For TVs and monitors in particular, there is the additional danger of
     CRT implosion - take care not to bang the CRT envelope with your tools.
     An implosion will scatter shards of glass at high velocity in every
     direction. There are several tons of force attempting to crush the
     typical CRT. Always wear eye protection.

   o Connect/disconnect any test leads with the equipment unpowered and
     unplugged. Use clip leads or solder temporary wires to reach cramped
     locations or difficult to access locations.

   o If you must probe live, put electrical tape over all but the last 1/16"
     of the test probes to avoid the possibility of an accidental short which
     could cause damage to various components. Clip the reference end of the
     meter or scope to the appropriate ground return so that you need to only
     probe with one hand.

   o Perform as many tests as possible with power off and the equipment
     unplugged. For example, the semiconductors in the power supply section
     of a TV or monitor can be tested for short circuits with an ohmmeter.

   o Use an isolation transformer if there is any chance of contacting line
     connected circuits. A Variac(tm) is not an isolation transformer! The
     use of a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) protected outlet is a
     good idea but will not protect you from shock from many points in a line
     connected TV or monitor, or the high voltage side of a microwave oven,
     for example. (Note however, that, a GFCI may nuisanse trip at power-on
     or at other random times due to leakage paths (like your scope probe
     ground) or the highly capacitive or inductive input characteristics of
     line powered equipment.) A fuse or circuit breaker is too slow and
     insensitive to provide any protection for you or in many cases, your
     equipment. However, these devices may save your scope probe ground wire
     should you accidentally connect it to a live chassis.

   o Don't attempt repair work when you are tired. Not only will you be more
     careless, but your primary diagnostic tool - deductive reasoning - will
     not be operating at full capacity.

   o Finally, never assume anything without checking it out for yourself!
     Don't take shortcuts!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.3 "Troubleshooting tips"

Many problems have simple solutions. Don't immediately assume that your
problem is some combination of esoteric complex convoluted failures. For a
monitor, it may just be a bad connection or blown fuse. Remember that the
problems with the most catastrophic impact on operation like a dead monitor
usually have the simplest solutions. The kind of problems we would like to
avoid at all costs are the ones that are intermittent or difficult to
reproduce: the occasional jitter or a monitor that blows its horizontal
output transistor every six months.

If you get stuck, sleep on it. Sometimes, just letting the problem bounce
around in your head will lead to a different more successful approach or
solution. Don't work when you are really tired - it is both dangerous
(especially with respect to monitors) and mostly non-productive (or possibly
destructive).

Whenever working on complex equipment, make copious notes and diagrams. You
will be eternally grateful when the time comes to reassemble the unit. Most
connectors are keyed against incorrect insertion or interchange of cables,
but not always. Apparently identical screws may be of differing lengths or
have slightly different thread types. Little parts may fit in more than one
place or orientation. Etc. Etc.

Pill bottles, film canisters, and plastic ice cube trays come in handy for
sorting and storing screws and other small parts after disassembly. This is
particularly true if you have repairs on multiple pieces of equipment under
way simultaneously.

Select a work area which is wide open, well lighted, and where dropped parts
can be located - not on a deep pile shag rug. The best location will also be
relatively dust free and allow you to suspend your troubleshooting to eat or
sleep or think without having to pile everything into a cardboard box for
storage.

Another consideration is ESD - Electro-Static Discharge. Some components
(like ICs) in a monitor are vulnerable to ESD. There is no need to go
overboard but taking reasonable precautions such as getting into the habit of
touching the chassis first before any of the electronic components is a good
practice.

A basic set of precision hand tools will be all you need to disassemble a
monitor and perform most adjustments. These do not need to be really
expensive but poor quality tools are worse than useless and can cause damage.
Needed tools include a selection of Philips and straight blade screwdrivers,
socket drivers, needlenose pliers, wire cutters, tweezers, and dental picks.
For adjustments, a miniature (1/16" blade) screwdriver with a non-metallic
tip is desirable both to prevent the presence of metal from altering the
electrical properties of the circuit and to minimize the possibility of
shorting something from accidental contact with the circuitry. A set of
plastic alignment tools will be useful for making adjustments to coils
(though you can forgo these until the (rare) need arises.

A low power (e.g., 25 W) fine tip soldering iron and fine rosin core solder
will be needed if you should need to disconnect any soldered wires (on
purpose or by accident) or replace soldered components. A higher power iron
or small soldering gun will be needed for dealing with larger components.
Never use acid core solder or the type used for sweating copper pipes!

For thermal or warmup problems, a can of 'cold spray' or 'circuit chiller'
(they are the same) and a heat gun or blow dryer come in handy to identify
components whose characteristics may be drifting with temperature. Using the
extension tube of the spray can or making a cardboard nozzle for the heat gun
can provide very precise control of which components you are affecting.

For info on useful chemicals, adhesives, and lubricants, see "Repair Briefs,
an Introduction" as well as other documents available at this site.

@endnode
@node 6.4 "Test equipment"

Don't start with the electronic test equipment, start with some analytical
thinking. Your powers of observation (and a little experience) will make a
good start. Your built in senses and that stuff between your ears represents
the most important test equipment you have.

However, some test equipment will be needed:

   o Multitester (DMM or VOM) - This is essential for checking of power
     supply voltages and voltages on the pins of ICs or other components -
     service literature like the SAMs Photofacts described elsewhere in this
     document include voltage measurements at nearly every circuit tie point
     for properly functioning equipment. The multitester will also be used to
     check components like transistors, resistors, and capacitors for correct
     value and for shorts or opens. You do not need a fancy instrument. A
     basic DMM - as long as it is reliable - will suffice for most
     troubleshooting. If you want one that will last for many years, go with
     a Fluke. However, even the mid range DMMs from Radio Shack have proven
     to be reliable and of acceptable accuracy. For some kinds of
     measurements - to deduce trends for example - an analog VOM is preferred
     (though some DMMs have a bar graph scale which almost as good).

   o Oscilloscope - While many problems can be dealt with using just a
     multimeter, a 'scope will be essential as you get more into advanced
     troubleshooting. Basic requirements are: dual trace, 10-20 MHz minimum
     vertical bandwidth, delayed sweep desirable but not essential. A good
     set of proper 10x/1x probes. Higher vertical bandwidth is desirable but
     most consumer electronics work can be done with a 10 MHz scope. A
     storage scope or digital scope might be desirable for certain tasks but
     is by no means essential for basic troubleshooting.

     I would recommend a good used Tektronix or HP scope over a new scope of
     almost any other brand. You will usually get more scope for your money
     and these things last almost forever. My 'good' scope is the militarized
     version (AN/USM-281A) of the HP180 lab scope. This has a dual channel 50
     MHz vertical plugin and a delayed sweep horizontal plugin. I have seen
     these going for under $300 from surplus outfits. For a little more
     money, you can get a Tek 465 100 Mhz scope ($400-700) which will suffice
     for all but the most demanding (read: RF or high speed digital) repairs.

   o A video signal source - depending on what type of monitor you are
     repairing, you may need both computer and television signals.

     Computer Monitors - a test PC is useful as a video source. Of course, it
     will need to support whatever scan rates and video types the monitor is
     designed to accept. Software programs are available to display purity,
     convergence, focus, color, and other test patterns. Or create your own
     test patterns using a program like Windows Paint.

     Studio monitors - a baseband video source like a VCR or camcorder is
     useful in lieu of a test pattern generator. These will allow you to you
     to control the program material. In fact, making some test tapes using a
     camcorder or video camera to record static test patterns will allow you
     full control of what is being displayed and for how long.

   o Color bar/dot/crosshatch signal generator. This is a useful piece of
     equipment if you are doing a lot of TV or studio monitor repair and need
     to perform CRT convergence and chroma adjustments. However, there are
     alternatives that are almost as good: a VHS recording of these test
     patterns will work for TVs. A PC programmed to output a suitable set of
     test patterns will be fine for monitors (and TVs if you can set up the
     video card to produce an NTSC/PAL signal. This can be put through a VCR
     to generate the RF (Channel 3/4) input to your TV if it does not have
     direct video inputs (RCA jacks).

     Sophisticated (and expensive) universal test pattern generators are
     available that will handle any possible monitor scan rate.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 6.5 "Incredibly handy widgets"

These are the little gadgets and homemade testers that are useful for many
repair situations. Here are just a few of the most basic:

   o Series light bulb for current limiting during the testing of TVs,
     monitors, switching power supplies, audio power amplifiers, etc. I built
     a dual outlet box with the outlets wired in series so that a lamp can be
     plugged into one outlet and the device under test into the other. For
     added versatility, add a regular outlet and 'kill' switch using a quad
     box instead. The use of a series load will prevent your expensive
     replacement part like a horizontal output transistor from blowing if
     there is still some fault in the circuit you have failed to locate.

   o A Variac. It doesn't need to be large - a 2 A Variac mounted with a
     switch, outlet and fuse will suffice for most tasks. However, a 5 amp or
     larger Variac is desirable. If you will be troubleshooting 220 VAC
     equipment in the US, there are Variacs that will output 0-240 VAC from a
     115 VAC line (just make sure you don't forget that this can easily fry
     your 115 VAC equipment.) By varying the line voltage, not only can you
     bring up a newly repaired monitor gradually to make sure there are no
     problems; you can also evaluate behavior at low and high line voltage.
     This can greatly aid in troubleshooting power supply problems. Warning:
     a Variac is not an isolation transformer and does not help with respect
     to safety. You need an isolation transformer as well.

   o Isolation transformer. This is very important for safely working on live
     chassis equipment. Since nearly all modern monitors utilize line
     connected switchmode power supply or line connected deflection circuits,
     it is essential. You can build one from a pair of similar power
     transformers back-to-back (with their highest rated secondaries
     connected together. I built mine from a couple of similar old tube type
     TV power transformers mounted on a board with an outlet box including a
     fuse. Their high voltage windings were connected together. The unused
     low voltage windings can be put in series with the primary or output
     windings to adjust voltage. Alternatively, commercial line isolation
     transformers suitable for TV troubleshooting are available for less than
     $100 - well worth every penny.

   o Variable isolation transformer. You don't need to buy a fancy
     combination unit. A Variac can be followed by a normal isolation
     transformer. (The opposite order also works. There may be some subtle

   o Degaussing coil. Make or buy. The internal degaussing coil salvaged from
     a defunct color TV or monitor doubled over to half it original diameter
     to increase its strength in series with a 200 W light bulb for current

@node 6.6 "Safe discharging of capacitors in TVs and video monitors"

It is essential - for your safety and to prevent damage to the device under
test as well as your test equipment - that large or high voltage capacitors
be fully discharged before measurements are made, soldering is attempted, or
the circuitry is touched in any way. Some of the large filter capacitors
commonly found in line operated equipment store a potentially lethal charge.

This doesn't mean that every one of the 250 capacitors in your TV need to be
discharged every time you power off and want to make a measurement. However,
the large main filter capacitors and other capacitors in the power supplies
should be checked and discharged if any significant voltage is found after
powering off (or before any testing - some capacitors (like the high voltage
of the CRT in a TV or video monitor) will retain a dangerous or at least
painful charge for days or longer!)

The technique I recommend is to use a high wattage resistor of about 100
ohms/V of the working voltage of the capacitor. This will prevent the
arc-welding associated with screwdriver discharge but will have a short
enough time constant so that the capacitor will drop to a low voltage in at
most a few seconds (dependent of course on the RC time constant and its
original voltage).

Then check with a voltmeter to be double sure. Better yet, monitor while
discharging (not needed for the CRT - discharge is nearly instantaneous even
with multi-M ohm resistor).

Obviously, make sure that you are well insulated!

   o For the main capacitors in a switching power supply which might be 100
     uF at 350 V this would mean a 5K 10W resistor. RC=.5 second. 5RC=2.5
     seconds. A lower wattage resistor can be used since the total energy in
     not that great. If you want to be more high tech, you can build the
     capacitor discharge circuit outlined in the companion document: "Testing
     Capacitors with a Multimeter and Safe Discharging". This provides a
     visible indication of remaining charge and polarity.

   o For the CRT, use a high wattage (not for power but to hold off the high
     voltage which could jump across a tiny 1/4 watt job) resistor of a few M
     ohms discharged to the chassis ground connected to the outside of the
     CRT - NOT SIGNAL GROUND ON THE MAIN BOARD as you may damage sensitive
     circuitry. The time constant is very short - a ms or so. However, repeat
     a few times to be sure. (Using a shorting clip lead may not be a bad
     idea as well while working on the equipment - there have been too many
     stories of painful experiences from charge developing for whatever
     reasons ready to bite when the HV lead is reconnected.) Note that if you
     are touching the little board on the neck of the CRT, you may want to
     discharge the HV even if you are not disconnecting the fat red wire -
     the focus and screen (G2) voltages on that board are derived from the
     CRT HV.

     If you are not going to be removing the CRT anode connection, replacing
     the flyback, or going near the components on the little board on the
     neck of the CRT, I would just stay away from the fat red wire and what
     it is connected to including the focus and screen wires. Repeatedly
     shoving a screwdriver under the anode cap risks scratching the CRT
     envelope which is something you really do not want to do.

Again, always double check with a reliable voltmeter!T

Reasons to use a resistor and not a screwdriver to discharge capacitors:

  1. It will not destroy screwdrivers and capacitor terminals.

  2. It will not damage the capacitor (due to the current pulse).

  3. It will reduce your spouse's stress level in not having to hear those
     scary snaps and crackles.

@node 6.7 "The series light bulb trick"

When powering up a monitor (or any other modern electronic devices with
expensive power semiconductors) that has had work done on any power circuits,
it is desirable to minimize the chance of blowing your newly installed parts
should there still be a fault. There are two ways of doing this: use of a
Variac to bring up the AC line voltage gradually and the use of a series load
to limit current to power semiconductors.

Actually using a series load - a light bulb is just a readily available cheap
load - is better than a Variac (well both might be better still) since it
will limit current to (hopefully) non-destructive levels.

What you want to do is limit current to the critical parts - usually the
horizontal output transistor (HOT). Most of the time you will get away with
putting it in series with the AC line. However, sometimes, putting a light
bulb directly in the B+ circuit will provide better protection as it will
limit the current out of the main filter capacitors to the HOT. Actually, an
actual power resistor is probably better as its resistance is constant as
opposed to a light bulb which will vary by 1:10 from cold to hot. The light
bulb, however, provides a nice visual indication of the current drawn by the
circuit under test. For example:

   o Full brightness: short circuit or extremely heavy load - a fault
     probably is still present.

   o Initially bright but then settles at reduced brightness: filter
     capacitors charge, then lower current to rest of circuit. This is what
     is expected when the equipment is operating normally. There could still
     be a problem with the power circuits but it will probably not result in
     an immediate catastrophic failure.

   o Pulsating: power supply is trying to come up but shutting down due to
     overcurrent or overvoltage condition. This could be due to a continuing
     fault or the light bulb may be too small for the equipment.

The following are suggested starting wattages:

   o 40 W bulb for VCR or laptop computer switching power supplies.
   o 100 W bulb for small (i.e., B/W or 13 inch color) monitors or TVs.
   o 150-200 W bulb for large color monitors or projection TVs.

Depending on the power rating of the equipment, these wattages may need to be
increased. However, start low. If the bulb lights at full brightness, you
know there is still a major fault. If it flickers or the TV (or other device)
does not quite come fully up, then it should be safe to go to a larger bulb.

@node 6.8 "Getting inside a monitor"

You will void the warranty - at least in principle. There are usually no
warranty seals on a monitor so unless you cause visible damage or mangle the
screws or plastic, it is unlikely that this would be detected. You need to
decide. A monitor still under warranty should probably be returned for
warranty service for any covered problems except those with the most obvious
and easy solutions. Another advantage of using warranty service is that
should your problem actually be covered by a design change, this will be
performed free of charge. And, you cannot generally fix a problem which is
due to poor design!

Getting into a monitor is usually quite simple requiring the removal of 2-10
Philips or 1/4" hex head screws - most around the rear edge of the cabinet or
underneath, a couple perhaps in the middle. Disconnect the input and power
cables first as it they stay with catch on the rear cover you are detaching.
Reconnect whatever is needed for testing after the cover is removed. Set the
screws aside and make notes if they are not all of the same length and thread
type - putting a too long screw in the wrong place can short out a circuit
board or break something else, for example. A screw that is too short may not
be secure.

Once all visible screws are out, try to remove the cover. There still may be
hidden catches or snaps around the edges or seam or hidden beneath little
plastic or rubber cosmetic covers. Sometimes, the tilt-swivel base will need
to be removed first. If no snaps or catches are in evidence, the cover may
just need a bit of persuasion in the form of a carefully placed screwdriver
blade (but be careful not to damage the soft plastic). A 'splitting' tool is
actually sold for this purpose.

As you pull the cover straight back (usually) and off, make sure that no
other wires are still attached. Often, the main circuit board rests on the
bottom of the cover in some slots. Go slow as this circuit board may try to
come along with the back. Once the back is off, you may need to prop the
circuit board up with a block of wood to prevent stress damage and contact
with the work surface.

Most - but not all - monitors can be safely and stably positioned either
still on the tilt-swivel base or on the bottom of the frame. However, some
will require care as the circuit board will be vulnerable.

Larger monitors are quite heavy and bulky. Get someone to help and take
precautions if yours is one of the unstable variety. If need be, the monitor
can usually safely be positioned on the CRT face if it is supported by foam
or a folded blanket.

Once the cover is off, you will find anywhere from none to a frustratingly
large number of sheetmetal (perforated or solid) shields. Depending on which
circuit boards need to be accessed, one or more of these shields may need to
be removed. Make notes of which screws go where and store in a safe place.
However, manufacturers often place holes at strategic locations in order to
access adjustments - check for these before going to a lot of unnecessary
bother. Note: sheetmetal usually has sharp edges. Take care.

Reassemble in reverse order. Getting the circuit board to slide smoothly into
its slots may take a couple of attempts but otherwise there should be no
surprises.

@node 6.9 "Dusting out the inside of a monitor"

The first thing you will notice when you remove the cover is how super dusty
everything is. Complements to the maid. You never dreamed there was that much
dust, dirt, and grime, in the entire house or office building!

Use a soft brush (like a new paintbrush) and a vacuum cleaner to carefully
remove the built up dust. Blowing off the dust will likely not hurt the unit
unless it gets redeposited inside various controls or switches but will be
bad for your lungs - and will spread dirt all over the room. Don't turn
anything - many critical adjustments masquerade as screws that just beg to be
tightened. Resist the impulse for being neat and tidy until you know exactly
what you are doing. Be especially careful around the components on the neck
of the CRT - picture tube - as some of these are easily shifted in position
and control the most dreaded of adjustments - for color purity and
convergence. In particular, there will be a series of adjustable ring
magnets.  It is a good idea to mark their position in any case with some
white paint, 'white out', or a Magic Marker so that if they do get moved - or
you move them deliberately, you will know where you started.

@node 7.1 "User picture adjustment"

For general viewing, subdued lighting is preferred. Avoid backlighting and
direct overhead lighting if possible.

Display an image with a variety of colors and the full range of brightness
from deep shadows to strong highlights. For PCs, a Windows desktop is
generally satisfactory. An outdoor scene on a sunny day is excellent for
studio monitors. Alternatively, use a test pattern specially designed for
this purpose.

Turn the BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST controls (or use the buttons) all the way
down.

Increase the BRIGHTNESS until a raster is just visible in the darkest
(shadow) areas of the picture.

Increase the CONTRAST until the desired intensity of highlights is obtained.

Since BRIGHTNESS and CONTRAST are not always independent, go back and forth
until you get the best picture.

On monitors with a color balance adjustment, you may want to set this but
unless you are doing photorealistic work, using the manufacturer's defaults
will be fine unless you need to match the characteristics of multiple
monitors located side-by-side.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.2 "Focus adjustment"

One of the most common complaints is that the monitor is not as crisp as it
used to be - or just not as sharp as expected.

Assuming that the focus has just been gradually getting worse over time,
tweaking the internal focus control may be all that is needed.

Some monitors have the focus adjustment accessible through a (possibly
unmarked) hole in the side or rear of the case.

Safety: as long as you do not go near anything else inside the monitor while
it is on AND keep one hand in you pocket, you should be able to do this
without a shocking experience.

Plug it in, turn it on and let it warm up for a half hour or so. Set your PC
(or other video source) to display in the resolution you use most often.
First turn the user brightness and contrast fully counterclockwise. Turn
brightness up until the raster lines in a totally black area appear, then
back a hair until they disappear. Then, turn the contrast control up until
you get a fairly bright picture. Fullly clockwise is probably ok. Adjust
FOCUS for generally best focus. You will not be able to get it razor sharp
all over the screen - start at the center and then try to get the edges and
corners as good as you can without messing up the center too much. Double
check that the focus is ok at your normal settings of brightness and contrast
and at other resolutions that you normally use.

The focus pot is usually located on the flyback transformer or on an
auxiliary panel nearby. The focus wire usually comes from the flyback or the
general area or from a terminal on a voltage the multiplier module (if used).
It is usually a wire by itself going to the little board on the neck of the
CRT.

The SCREEN control adjusts background brightness. If the two controls are not
marked, you will not do any damage by turning the wrong one - it will be
immediately obvious as the brightness will change rather than focus and you
can then return it to its original position (or refer to the section on
@{"brightness adjustments" link "7.3"} to optimize its setting).

On a decent monitor, you should be able to make out the individual scanning
lines at all resolutions though it will be toughest at the highest scan
rates. If they lines are fuzzy, especially in bright areas, then focus may
need to be adjusted or there may be an actual fault in the focus circuitry or
a defective or just marginal CRT.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.3 "Brightness and color balance adjustment"

A monitor which has a picture that is very dark and cannot be adequately set
with the user brightness and contrast controls may need internal adjustment
of the SCREEN (the term, screen, here refers to a particular electrode inside
the CRT, not really the brightness of the screen you see, though it applies
here), MASTER BRIGHTNESS, or BACKGROUND level controls. As components age,
including the CRT, the brightness will change, usually decrease. The
following procedure will not rejuvenate an old CRT but may get just enough
brightness back to provide useful functionality for a few months or longer.
If the problem is not with the age of the CRT, then it may return the monitor
to full brightness. The assumption here is that there is a picture but the
dark areas are totally black and the light areas are not bright enough even
with the user brightness control turned all the way up.

In most cases, the cover will need to be removed. The controls we are looking
for may be located in various places. Rarely, there will be access holes on
the back or side. However, if there are unmarked holes, then the FOCUS and
SCREEN controls are the most likely possibilities.

The controls may be located on the:

   o Flyback (LOPT) transformer. Usually there is a master screen control
     along with a focus control on the flyback transformer.

   o A little board on the neck of the CRT. There may be a master screen
     control. a master brightness control, a master background level control,
     or individual controls for red, green, and blue background level. Other
     variations are possible. There may also be individual gain/contrast
     controls.

   o Main video board is less common, but the background level controls may
     be located here.

Display a picture at the video resolution you consider most important which
includes both totally black and full white areas which also includes sharp
vertical edges.

Set the user brightness control to its midpoint and the user contrast control
as low as it will go - counterclockwise.

Let the monitor warm up for at least 15 minutes so that components can
stabilize.

If there is a MASTER BRIGHTNESS or BACKGROUND level control, use this to make
the black areas of the picture just barely disappear. Them, increase it until
the raster lines just appear. (They should be a neutral gray. If there is a
color tint, then the individual color background controls will need to be
adjusted to obtain a neutral gray.) If there is no such control, use the
master screen control on the flyback. If it is unmarked, then try both of the
controls on the flyback - one will be the screen control and the other will
be focus - the effects will be obvious. If you did touch focus, set it for
best overall focus and then get back to the section on @{"focus" link "7.2"} once you are
done here.

If there are individual controls for each color, you may use these but be
careful as you will be effecting the color balance. Adjust so that the raster
lines in a black area are just visible and dark neutral gray.

If there is a 'service switch' you may prefer to make the adjustment with
this in the service position. The raster will collapse to a single horizontal
line and the video input will be disabled and forced to black. The BACKGROUND
or SCREEN control can then be adjusted as above.

Now for the gain controls. On the little board on the neck of the CRT or on
the video or main board there will be controls for R, G, and B DRIVE (also
may be called GAIN, or CONTRAST - they are the same). The knobs or slots may
even be color coded as to which primary (R,G,B) it affects. If there are only
two then the third color is fixed and if the color balance in the highlights
of the picture was ok, then there is nothing more you can do here.

Set the user contrast control as high as it will go - clockwise.

Now adjust each internal color DRIVE control as high as you can without that
particular color 'blooming' at very bright vertical edges. Blooming means
that the focus deteriorates for that color and you get a big blotch of color
trailing off to the right of the edge. You may need to go back and forth
among the 3 DRIVE controls since the color that blooms first will limit the
amount that you can increase the contrast settings. Set them so that you get
the brightest neutral whites possible without any single color blooming.

Note that this is ignoring the effects of any beam current or brightness
limiter circuitry. Any recommendations in the service manual should be
followed to minimize the chance of excess X-ray emissions as well as to avoid
burn-in of the phosphor screen.

Now check out the range of the user controls and adjust the appropriate
internal controls where necessary. You may need to touch up the background
levels or other settings. Check at the other resolutions and refresh rates
that you normally use.

If none of this provides acceptable brightness, then either your CRT is in
its twilight years or there is something actually broken in the monitor. If
the decrease in brightness has been a gradual process over the course of
years, then it is most likely the CRT. As a last resort you can try
increasing the filament current to the CRT the way CRT boosters that used to
be sold for TVs worked. See the section: @{"Brightening a CRT" link "11.12"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.4 "Position, size, and linearity adjustment"

Position and size are usually user controls on computer and video monitors
but not on TVs. On monitors with digital controls, they may usually be set
for each resolution. On cheaper monitors, there may be a knobs on the front
or back panel. Sometimes, there are located internally. There may be separate
adjustments for each scan range and may or may not be accessible through
holes in the back panel.

There may also be an adjustment called 'horizontal phase' which controls the
relative timing of the horizontal sync pulse with respect to retrace. Its
effect is subtly different than horizontal position which actually moves the
raster. If possible, center the raster and then use H Phase to center the
picture.

In monochrome monitors (mostly), position may be set via a pair of rings on
the neck of the CRT.

Size can be set to your preference for each scan rate (if they are
independent). For computer work, slight underscan is often preferred as all
of the frame buffer is visible. However, any slight geometric problems with
the raster will be all too visible when compared with the straight sides of
the CRT bezel.

For normal viewing of video (television) monitors, raster size should be set
so that there is about 10-15 percent overscan all around. This will allow
ample margin for power line voltage fluctuations, component aging, and the
reduction in raster size that may occur with some VCR special effects (CUE
and REV) modes. However, for studio use, underscan is often preferred or at
least an option to permit the entire raster to be inspected.

Modern color monitors may not have any horizontal linearity control but you
may find this on older models. There may be an internal vertical linearity
adjustment. I am not aware of any that have user accessible linearity
controls. If there are internal pots or coils, you will need to go back and
forth between size and linearity as these adjustments are usually not
independent.

Of course, parameters controlling your video card also affect position and
size. There is no best approach to reconciling the effects of monitor and
video card position adjustments. But, in general, start with the monitor
controls centered within their range or use the memory defaults as
appropriate. Then, use the video card setup program to optimize the settings.
Only if these do not have enough range should you use the monitor controls.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.5 "Pincushion adjustments"

Horizontal pincushion refers to any bowing in or out on the vertical sides of
the raster. There is not usually any explicit vertical pincushion adjustment.
Adjustment usually uses two controls - amplitude and phase. Pincushion
amplitude as its name implies, controls the size of the correction.
Pincushion phase affects where on the sides it is applied. Don't expect
perfection.

If the controls have no effect, there is probably a fault in the pincushion
correction circuitry.

It is best to make these adjustments with a crosshatch or dot test pattern

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.6 "Geometry adjustment"

This refers to imperfections in the shape of the picture not handled by the
pincushion and size adjustments. These types of defects include a trapezoidal
or keystone shaped raster and jogs or wiggles around the periphery of the
raster. Unfortunately, one way these are handled at the factory is to glue
little magnets to strategic locations on the CRT and/or rotate little magnets
mounted on the yoke frame. Unless you really cannot live with the way it is
(assuming there isn't something actually broken), leave these alone! You can
end up with worse problems. In any case, carefully mark the position AND
orientation of every magnet so that if this happens, you can get back to
where you started. If the magnets are on little swivels, some experimenting
with them one at a time may result in some improvement. Of course it is best
to obtain a service manual and follow its instructions. However, this may not
be possible at reasonable cost or at all for many computer monitors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.7 "Why is the convergence on my monitor bad near the edges"

Very simple - nothing is quite perfect. Perfect convergence is not even
necessarily possible in theory with the set of adjustments available on a
typical monitor. It is all a matter of compromises. Consider what you are
trying to do: get three electron beams which originate from different
electron guns to meet at a single point within a fraction of a mm everywhere
on the screen. This while the beams are scanning at an typical effective
writing rate of 50,000 mph across the face of a 17" CRT (assumed resolution:
1024x768 at 75 Hz) in a variable magnetic environment manufactured at a price
you can afford without a second mortgage!

The specifications for misconvergence have two parts: a center error and a
corner error. The acceptable center error is always the smaller of the two -
possibly .1-.2 mm. compared to .3-.5 mm in the corners. Very often, you will
find that what you are complaining about is well within this specification.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.8 "CRT purity and convergence problem"

Purity assures that each of the beams for the 3 primary colors - R, G, B, -
red, green, and blue - strikes only the proper phosphor for that color. A
totally red scene will appear pure red and so forth. Symptoms of poor purity
are blotches of discoloration on the screen. Objects will change shades of
color when the move from one part of the screen to another. There may even be
excess non-uniformity of pure white or gray images.

Convergence refers to the control of the instantaneous positions of the red,
green, and blue spots as they scan across the face of the CRT so that they
are as nearly coincident as possible. Symptoms of poor convergence are
colored borders on solid objects or visible separate R, G, and B images of
fine lines or images,

Note: It is best to face the monitor North-South (front-to-back) when doing
any purity and convergence adjustments. Since you may have no way of knowing
what orientation will eventually be used, this is the best compromise as the
earth's magnetic field will be aligned front-back. However, if the monitor
will definitely be in a fixed location, use that orientation instead.

First, make sure no sources of strong magnetic fields are in the vicinity of
the monitor - loudspeakers, refrigerator magnets, MRI scanners, etc. A nearby
lightening strike or EMP from a nuclear explosion can also affect purity so
try to avoid these.

Cycle power a couple of times to degauss the CRT (1 minute on, 20 minutes
off) - see the section: @{"Degaussing (demagnetizing) the CRT" link "4.5"} If the built in
degaussing circuits have no effect, use an external manual degaussing coil to
be sure that your problems are not simply due to residual magnetism.

Assuming this doesn't help, you will need to set the internal purity and/or
convergence adjustments on the CRT.

First, mark the positions of all adjustments - use white paint, 'White out',
or a Magic Marker on the ring magnets on the neck of the CRT, the position
and tilt of the deflection yoke, and any other controls that you may touch
deliberately or by accident.

Note: if your monitor is still of the type with a drawer or panel of knobs
for these adjustments, don't even think about doing anything without a
service manual and follow it to the letter unless the functions of all the
knobs is clearly marked (some manufacturers actually do a pretty good job of
this).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.9 "CRT purity adjustment"

Purity on modern CRTs is usually set by a combination of a set of ring
magnets just behind the deflection yoke on the neck of the CRT and the
position of the yoke fore-aft. As always, mark the starting position of all
the rings and make sure you are adjusting the correct set if rings!

Use the following purity adjustment procedure as a general guide only.
Depending on the particular model monitor, your procedure may substitute
green for red. This depends on the gun placement in the CRT. The procedures
for dot-mask, slot mask, and Trinitron (aperture grille) CRTs will vary
slightly. See you service manual!

Obtain a white raster (sometimes there is a test point that can be grounded
to force this). Then, turn down the bias controls for blue and green so that
you have a pure red raster. Let the monitor warm up for a minimum of 15
minutes.

Loosen the deflection yoke clamp and move the yoke as far back as it will go,

Adjust the purity magnets to center the red vertical raster on the screen.

Now, move the yoke forward until you have the best overall red purity.
Tighten the clamp securely and reinstall the rubber wedges (if your CRT has
these) to stabilize the yoke position. Reset the video adjustments you
touched to get a red raster.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 7.10 "CRT convergence adjustment"

In the good old days when monitors were monitors (and not just a mass
produced commodity item) there were literally drawers or panels full of knobs
for setting convergence. One could spend hours and still end up with a less
than satisfactory picture. As the technology progressed, the number of
electronic adjustments went down drastically so that today there are very few
if any. However, some high end monitors do have user accessible controls for
minor adjustment of static (center) convergence.

Unless you want a lot of frustration, I would recommend not messing with
convergence. You could end up a lot worse. I have no idea what is used for
convergence on your set but convergence adjustments are never quite
independent of one another. You could find an adjustment that fixes the
problem you think you have only to discover some other area of the screen is
totally screwed. In addition, there are adjustments for geometry and purity
and maybe others that you may accidentally move without even knowing it until
you have buttoned up the set.

Warning: Accurately mark the original positions - sometimes you will change
something that will not have an obvious effect but will be noticeable later
on. So it is extremely important to be able to get back to where you started.
If only red/green vertical lines are offset, then it is likely that only a
single ring needs to be moved - and by just a hair. But, you may accidentally
move something else!

If you really cannot live with it, make sure you mark everything very
carefully so you can get back to your current state. A service manual is
essential!

Convergence is set using a white crosshatch or dot test pattern. For PCs (a
similar approach applies to workstations) If you do not have a test pattern
generator, use a program like Windows Paint to create a facsimile of a
crosshatch pattern and use this for your convergence adjustments. For a
studio video monitor, any static scene (from a camcorder or previously
recorded tape, for example) with a lot of fine detail will suffice.

Static convergence sets the beams to be coincident in the exact center of the
screen. This is done using a set of ring magnets behind the purity magnets on
the CRT neck. (Set any user convergence controls to their center position).

Adjust the center set of magnets on the CRT neck to converge blue to green at
the center of the screen. Adjust the rear set of magnets to converge red to
green at the center of the screen." Your monitor may have a slightly
different procedure.

Dynamic convergence adjusts for coincidence at the edges and corners.

On old tube, hybrid, and early solid state monitors, dynamic convergence was
accomplished with electronic adjustments of which there may have been a dozen
or more that were not independent. With modern monitors, convergence is done
with magnet rings on the neck of the CRT, magnets glued to the CRT, and by
tilting the deflection yoke. The clamp in conjunction with rubber wedges or
set screws assures that the yoke remains in position.

Remove the rubber wedges.

Loosen the deflection yoke clamp just enough so that it can be tilted but
will remain in the position you leave it. Rock the yoke up and down to
converge the right and left sides of the screen. Rock the yoke from side to
side to converge the top and bottom of the screen. The rubber wedges can be
used as pivots to minimize the interaction between the two axes but you may
need to go back and forth to optimize convergence on all sides. Reinstall the
wedges firmly and tape them to the CRT securely. Tighten the yoke clamp
enough to prevent accidental movement.

Some monitors may use a plastic frame and set screws instead of just a clamp
and rubber wedges but the procedure is similar.

Refer to your service manual. (Is this beginning to sound repetitious)?

For additional comments on convergence adjustments, see the section:

@node 7.11 "Tilted picture"

You have just noticed that the picture on your fancy (or cheap) monitor is
not quite horizontal - not aligned with the front bezel. Note that often
there is some keystoning or other geometric distortion as well where the top
and bottom or left and right edges of the picture are not quite parallel -
which you may never have noticed until now. Since this may not be correctable
(at least, not without a lot of hassle), adjusting tilt may represent a
compromise at best between top/bottom or left/right alignment of the picture
edges. You may never sleep again knowing that your monitor picture is not
perfect! BTW, I can sympathize with your unhappiness. Few things are more
annoying than a just noticeable imperfection such as this.

There are several possible causes for a tilted picture:

  1. You just became aware of it but nothing has changed. Don't dismiss this
     offhand. It is amazing how much we ignore unless it is brought to our
     attention. Are you a perfectionist? Did your friend just visit boasting
     about his P8-1000 screamer?

  2. There is an external tilt control which may be misadjusted. Newer Sony
     monitors have this and it is a most wonderful addition. Too bad about
     the stabilizing wires on Trinitron CRTs. A digital control may have lost
     its memory accidentally. The circuitry could have a problem.

  3. There is an internal tilt control that is misadjusted. Not common.

  4. The deflection yoke on the CRT has gotten rotated or was not oriented
     correctly at the time of manufacture. Sometimes, the entire yoke is
     glued in place in addition to being clamped adding another complication
     (but reducing the chance that this is the cause). On some monitors, you
     can rotate the CRT slightly instead.

     If the monitor was recently bumped or handled roughly, the yoke may have
     been knocked out of position. But in most cases, the amount of abuse
     required to do this with the yoke firmly clamped and/or glued would have
     totally destroyed the monitor in the process.

     There is a risk (in addition to the risk of frying yourself on the
     various voltages present inside as operating monitor) of messing up the
     convergence or purity when fiddling with the yoke or anything around it
     since the yoke position on the neck of the tube and its tilt will affect
     purity and convergence. Tape any rubber wedges under the yoke securely
     in place as these will maintain the proper position and tilt of the yoke
     while you are messing with it. (Don't assume the existing tape will hold
     - the adhesive is probably dry and brittle).

  5. The CRT may have rotated slightly with respect to the front bezel.
     Irrespective of the cause of the tilt, sometimes it is possible to
     loosen the 4 (typical) CRT mounting screws and correct the tilt by
     slightly rotating the CRT. This may be easier than rotating the yoke.

  6. External magnetic fields can sometimes cause a rotation without any
     other obvious effects - have you changed the monitor's location? Try it
     somewhere else.

@node 8.1 "Low voltage power supply fundamentals"

Monitors require a variety of voltages (at various power levels) to function.
The function of the low voltage power supply is to take the AC line input of
either 115 VAC 60 Hz (220 VAC 50 Hz or other AC power in Europe and
elsewhere) and produce some of these DC voltages. In all cases, the power to
the horizontal output transistor of the horizontal deflection system (B+) is
obtained directly from the low voltage power supply. In some cases, a variety
of other DC voltages are derived directly from the AC line by rectification,
filtering, and regulation. In other designs, however, most of the low
voltages are derived from secondary windings on the flyback (LOPT)
transformer of the horizontal deflection system. In still other designs,
there is a separate switchmode power supply that provides some or all of
these voltages. There are also various (and sometimes convoluted)
combinations of any or all of the above.

Note: we will often use the term 'B+' to denote the main DC voltage that
powers the horizontal deflection system of most monitors.

The following are a couple of the typical arrangements found in color
monitors:

  1. All low voltages except for the B+ to the horizontal output transistor
     (HOT) are derived from the horizontal deflection (flyback). This is the
     scheme used in the majority of TVs. Some kind of startup circuit gets
     the HOT booted but then all internal logic and video amplifier power is
     obtained from various windings on the flyback transformer. The B+ of
     anywhere from 60 to 130 V (higher for countries using 220 VAC line
     voltage) is likely to be regulated and its value selected based on the
     scan rate detected. High voltage is obtained from the flyback.

  2. Some or all of the low voltages are provided by a switchmode power
     supply (SMPS) independent of the horizontal deflection. Additional
     voltages may be provided from flyback windings as in (1). Sometimes,
     this SMPS is a self contained and easily tested, swapped, and repaired
     unit. In other cases, it is built onto the mainboard making it more
     difficult to trace the circuit and troubleshoot. High voltage may be
     obtained from the flyback or a separate HV module.

For multiscan monitors, the low voltage power supplies can get to be quite
complex as varying voltages are required for at least the horizontal
deflection based on scan range. Separate regulators may be used for each
range which are switched by the microprocessor or a single regulator may be
programmed for the required voltages. This is one area where a typical PC
monitor departs significantly in design compared to a TV or fixed scan rate
studio or workstation monitor.

There will always be:

  1. A power switch, relay, or triac to enable main power.

  2. A set of rectifiers - usually in a bridge configuration - to turn the AC
     into DC. Small ceramic capacitors are normally placed across the diodes
     to reduce RF interference.

  3. One or more large filter capacitors to smooth the unregulated DC. In the
     U.S., this is most often a voltage around 150-160 V DC. In countries
     with 220 VAC power, it will typically be around 300-320 V DC.

  4. A discrete, hybrid, or IC regulator to provide stable DC to the
     horizontal deflection system. Sometimes feedback from a secondary output
     of the flyback or even the high voltage is used. This regulator may be
     either a linear or switching type. In some cases, there is no regulator.
     Alternatively, an entire switchmode power supply may be used to provide
     one or more stable voltages to the horizontal deflection and other
     circuitry.

     Items (1) to (4) may be part of a separate low voltage power supply
     module or located on the mainboard.

  5. Zero or more voltage dividers and/or regulators to produce additional
     voltages directly from the line power. This relatively rare except for
     startup circuits. These voltages will not be isolated from the line.

  6. A degauss control circuit usually including a thermistor or Posistor (a
     combination of a heater disk and Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC)
     thermistor in a single package). When power is turned on, a relatively
     high AC current is applied to the degauss coil wrapped around the
     periphery of the CRT. The PTC thermister heats up, increases in
     resistance, and smoothly decreases the current to nearly zero over a
     couple of seconds. Alternative schemes including RC delays and relays
     are often used in monitors which have degaussing buttons.

  7. A startup circuit for booting the horizontal deflection if various
     voltages to run the monitor are derived from the flyback. This may be an
     IC or discrete multivibrator or something else running off a
     non-isolated voltage or the standby power supply. Some monitors simply
     take the video input and use this via some simple logic or amplifier
     circuitry to drive the HOT. With these, there will be no action of any
     kind if there is no input signal. (Remember the old IBM PC monitors?
     Unplug the video cable and the raster collapsed to a vertical line and
     then disappeared.)

  8. A standby power supply for the microcontroller and remote sensor.
     Usually, this is a separate low voltage power supply using a small power
     transformer for line isolation. If the monitor does not have digital
     controls and/or has a hard on/off switch (not s soft touch button), this
     section is not neeeded.

Always use an isolation transformer when working on a monitor but this is
especially important - for your safety - when dealing with the non-isolated
line operated power supply section. Read and follow the safety guidelines.
Also see the document: "Notes on the diagnosis and repair of small SwitchMode
Power Supplies (SMPS)" for additional tips and techniques when diagnosing and
testing switchmode power supplies.

@endnode
@node 8.2 "Monitor deflection derived power supply faults"

Monitors use a variety of switching supply techniques and it would be
difficult to cover every possibility but here are some comments for those
that use deflection derived approaches:

Horizontal output transistor (usually a TO3 metal or TOP3 plastic case shorts
out. This will usually blow a fuse or fusable resistor as well.

Horizontal drive chain - horizontal oscillator, driver, or driver
transformer. Newer monitors may use an IC for the oscillator and this can
fail.

Startup - There may be some kind of startup circuit which gets the whole
thing going until the auxiliary voltages are available. This could be as
simple as a multivibrator or transistor regulator to provide initial voltage
to the horizontal oscillator chip or circuit.

Output rectifier diodes can fail shorted and load down the outputs to the
point of shutting down.

Some load could be shorted or a capacitor could be shorted leading to
overload and shutdown.

Flyback transformer can have shorted windings which load down the output.
These (primary shorts in particular) may cause the horizontal output
transistor to fail as well. Common problem with older MacIntosh computers and
video terminals. Some secondary faults may not be instantly destructive but
result in little or no high voltage and overheating.

Also, look for cold solder joints - monitors tend to have these as a result
of temperature cycling and bad manufacturing. (Is this sounding repetitive
yet?)

Sometimes there is a series regulator after the filter cap and this could be
bad as well.

Without a schematic, I would attempt to trace the circuit from the main
filter cap or output of the line operated switchmode power supply assuming
that has the proper (approx. 60-120 VDC depending on scan range) voltage.

If you can locate the horizontal output transistor, see if there is voltage
on its collector, should be the same. If there is, then there is probably a
drive problem. If you have an ECG or similar semi cross reference, that will
help you identify the ICs and transistors and locate the relevant portions of
the circuitry.

If there is no voltage at the horizontal output transistor, then there is
probably a blown fuse or bad connection somewhere or a fault in the line
operated SMPS if there is one. However, the fuse may have blown due to a
fault in the SMPS or horizontal deflection.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.3 "Power button on monitor is flakey"

If the on/off (or other button) on the monitor itself behaves erratically
then the most likely cause is the obvious - the button or switch is dirty or
worn. On a momentary pushbutton, if you can get at it, some contact cleaner
may help.

If power is controlled by a hard switch - a mechanical push-push latching
switch and this has become erratic due to worn contacts or just plain broken,
replacements may be available but often only directly from the original
manufacturer to physically fit. As an alternative, consider mounting a small
toggle switch on the side of the cabinet to substitute for the defective one.
This will almost certainly be easier and cheaper - and quite possibly, more
reliable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.4 "Monitor blows fuse"

If the fuse really blows absolutely instantly with no indication that the
circuits are functioning (no high pitched horizontal deflection whine (if
your dog hides under the couch whenever the monitor is turned on, deflection
is probably working)), then this points to a short somewhere quite near the
AC power input. The most common places would be:

   o Degauss Posistor - very likely.
   o MOV or other surge suppressor.
   o Horizontal output transistor (if deflection derived power supply)
   o Power supply regulator if there is one.
   o Switchmode power transistor if there is a line operated SMPS.
   o Diode(s) in main bridge
   o Main filter capacitor(s).

You should be able to eliminate these one by one.

Unplug the degauss coil as this will show up as a low resistance.

First, measure across the input to the main power rectifiers - it should not
be that low. A reading of only a few ohms may mean a shorted rectifier or
two, a shorted Posistor, or a fried MOV.

   o Test the rectifiers individually or remove and retest the resistance.

   o Some monitors use a Posistor for degauss control. This is a little
     cubical (about 1/2" x 3/4" x 1") component with 3 legs. It includes a
     line operated heater disk (which often shorts out) and a PTC thermister
     to control current to the degauss coil. Remove the posistor and try
     power. If the monitor now works, obtain a replacement but in the
     meantime you just won't have the automatic degauss.

If these test good, use an ohmmeter with the monitor unplugged to measure the
horizontal output transistor or SMPS switchmode transistor. Even better to
remove it and measure it.

   o C-E should be high in at least one direction. (Both directions should be
     high if the transistor does not have an internal damper diode).

   o B-E should be high in one direction and not shorted in the other or
     around 50 ohms in both directions (typical for transistors with internal
     damper diodes) but should not be near 0.

If any readings are under 5 or 10 ohms, the transistor is bad. The parts
sources listed at the end of this document will have suitable replacements.

If this tests bad, try powering the monitor first with your light bulb and if
it just flashes once when the capacitor is charging, put a proper fuse in and
try it. The fuse should not blow with the transistor removed.

Of course, not much else will work either.

Install a new transistor and power the monitor using your series light bulb.
If the bulb now flashes once and then settles down to a low brightness level,
the monitor may be fine. See if there is an indication of deflection and HV -
look for the glow of the CRT filaments and turn up the brightness to see if
there is any indication of a raster. With the light bulb, not everything will
be normal but some life would be a good sign. Even a pulsating light bulb may
just mean that the light bulb is too small for the monitor power
requirements.  It may be safe to try a higher wattage bulb.

If the bulb glows at close to full brightness, there is probably still some
fault elsewhere. Don't be tempted to remove the light bulb just yet. There
could be problems with the driving circuits, flyback, secondary loads, or
with the feedback from the voltages derived from the horizontal not
regulating properly.

See if you can locate any other large power transistors in metal (TO3) cans
or large plastic (TOP3) cases. There may be a separate power transistor that
does the low voltage regulation or a separate regulator IC or hybrid. As
noted, some monitors have a switchmode power supply that runs off a different
transistor than the HOT. There is a chance that one of these may be bad.

If it is a simple transistor, the same ohmmeter check should be performed.

If none of this proves fruitful, it may be time to try to locate a schematic.

A blown fuse is a very common type of fault due to poor design very often
triggered by power surges due to outages or lightening storms. However, the
most likely parts to short are easily tested, usually in-circuit, with an
ohmmeter and then easily removed to confirm.

Occasionally, fuses simply tire of life and just replacing the fuse will be
all that is needed.

Even if it is more involved than this, if you find the problem and repair it
yourself, the cost is likely to be under $25.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.5 "Internal fuse blew during lightening storm (or elephant hit power pole)"

Power surges or nearby lightening strikes can destroy electronic equipment.
However, most of the time, damage is minimal or at least easily repaired.
With a direct hit, you may not recognize what is left of it!

Ideally, electronic equipment should be unplugged (both AC line and phone
line!) during electrical storms if possible. Modern TVs, VCRs, microwave
ovens, and even stereo equipment is particularly susceptible to lightening
and surge damage because some parts of the circuitry are always alive and
therefore have a connection to the AC line. Telephones, modems, and faxes are
directly connected to the phone lines. Better designs include filtering and
surge suppression components built in. With a near-miss, the only thing that
may happen is for the internal fuse to blow or for the microcontroller to go
bonkers and just require power cycling. There is no possible protection
against a direct strike. However, devices with power switches that totally
break the line connection are more robust since it takes much more voltage to
jump the gap in the switch than to fry electronic parts. Monitors and TVs may
also have their CRTs magnetized due to the electromagnetic fields associated
with a lightening strike - similar but on a smaller scale to the EMP of a
nuclear detonation.

Was the monitor operating or on standby at the time? If it was switched off
using an actual power switch (not a logic pushbutton), then either a
component in front of the switch has blown, the surge was enough to jump the
gap between the switch contacts, or it was just a coincidence (yeh, right).

If it was operating or on standby or has no actual power switch, then a
number of parts could be fried.

Monitors usually have their own internal surge protection devices like MOVs
(Metal Oxide Varistors) after the fuse. So it is possible that all that is
wrong is that the line fuse has blown. Remove the case (unplug it first!) and
start at the line connector. If you find a blown fuse, remove it and measure
across the in-board side of fuse holder and the other (should be the neutral)
side of the line. The ohmmeter reading should be fairly high - more than 100
ohms in at least one direction. You may need to unplug the degaussing coil to
get a reasonable reading as its resistance may be less than 30 ohms. If the
reading is really low, there are other problems. If the resistance checks
out, replace the fuse and try powering the monitor. There will be three
possibilities:

  1. It will work fine, problem solved.

  2. It will immediately blow the fuse. This means there is at least one
     component shorted - possibilities include an MOV, line rectifiers, main
     filter cap, regulator transistor, horizontal output transistor, etc. You
     will need to check with your ohmmeter for shorted semiconductors. Remove
     any that are suspect and see of the fuse now survives (use the series
     light bulb to cut your losses - see the section: @{"The series light bulb trick" link "6.7"}

  3. It will not work properly or appear dead. This could mean there are open
     fusable resistors other defective parts in the power supply or
     elsewhere. In this case further testing will be required and at some
     point you may need the schematic.

If the reading is very low or the fuse blows again, see the section:
@{"Monitor blows fuse" link "8.4"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.6 "Fuse replaced but monitor clicks with power-on but no other action"

The click probably means that the power relay is working, though there could
be bad contacts.

Since the fuse doesn't blow now (you did replace it with one of the same
ratings, right?), you need to check for:

   o Other blown fuses - occasionally there are more than one in a TV.

Replace with one of exactly the same ratings.

   o Open fusable resistors. These sometimes blow at the same time or in
     place of the fuses. They are usually low values like 2 ohms and are in
     big rectangular ceramic power resistor cases or smaller blue or gray
     colored cylindrical power resistors. They are supposed to protect
     expensive parts like the HOT but often blow at the same time (or the
     pricey HOT sacrifices itself to save the resistor.)

If any of these are bad, they will need to be replaced with flameproof
resistors of the same ratings (though you can substitute an ordinary resistor
for testing purposes). Before applying power, check: Rectifier diodes,
horizontal output transistor, regulator pass or chopper transistor (if
present), and main filter capacitor for shorts.

An initial test with an ohmmeter can be done while in-circuit. The resistance
across each diode and the collector to emitter of the transistors should be
relatively high - a few hundred ohms at lest - in at least one direction
(in-circuit). If there is a question, unsolder one side of each diode and
check - should be in the Megohms or higher in one direction. Removed from the
circuit, the collector-emitter resistance should be very high in one
direction at least. Depending on the type, the base-emitter resistance may be
high in one direction or around 50 ohms. If any reading on a semiconductor
device is under 10 ohms - then the device most likely bad. Assuming that you
do not have a schematic, you should be able to locate the rectifiers near
where the line cord is connected and trace the circuit. The transistors will
be either in a TO3 large metal can or a TOP3 plastic package - on heat sinks.
The filter capacitor should eventually measure high in one direction (it will
take a while to charge from your ohmmeter). It could still be failing at full
voltage, however.

If you find one bad part, still check everything else as more than one part
may fail and just replacing one may cause it to fail again.

Assuming nothing tests faulty so far, clip a voltmeter set on its 500 V or
higher scale across the horizontal output transistor and turn the power on.
Warning - never measure this point if the horizontal deflection is operating.
It is ok now since the monitor is dead. If the voltage here is 100-150, then
there is a problem in the drive to the horizontal output circuit. If it is
low or 0, then there are still problems in the power supply or with the
winding on the flyback transformer or one of its outputs.

Other possible problems: bad hybrid voltage regulator, bad startup circuit,
bad relay contacts as mentioned above.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.7 "Power-on tick-tick-tick or click-click-click but no other action"

A variety of power supply or startup problems can result in this or similar
behavior. Possibilities include:

   o Lack of startup horizontal drive - see the section: @{"Startup problems" link "8.14"}
     The main regulator is cycling on overvoltage due to lack of load.

   o Excessive load or faulty power supply cycling on its overcurrent
     protection circuit.

   o HV shutdown, or some other system detecting an out of regulation
     condition. However, in this case, there should be some indication that
     the deflection and HV is attempting to come up like momentary high
     pitched deflection whine, static on the screen, etc.

   o A dried up main filter capacitor or other filter capacitor in the low
     voltage power supply that is producing an out-of-regulation condition A
     bad filter capacitor on the output of a series regulator may also result
     in excessive voltage and shutdown.

   o A problem with the microcontroller, relay or its driver, or standby
     power supply.

One possible test would be to vary the line voltage and observe the set's
behavior. It may work fine at one extreme (usually low) or the other. This
might give clues as to what is wrong.

Also see the section:
@{"Dead monitor with periodic tweet-tweet-tweet or flub-flub-flub" link "8.11"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.8 "No picture but indications of power"

The screen is blank with no raster at all. There are indications that the
power is alive - the status LEDs are lit and you can hear the normal relay
clicking sounds when you change video modes. This indicates that some of the
low voltages are present but these may be derived from the standby supply.

Assuming there is no deflection and no HV, you either have a low voltage
power supply problem, bad startup circuit, or bad horizontal output
transistor (HOT)/bad parts in the horizontal deflection.

Check for bad fuses.

(If you have HV as indicated by static electricity on the front of the screen
and you hear the high pitched whine of the horizontal deflection when it is
turned on, then the following does not apply).

  1. Use an ohmmeter to test the HOT for shorts. If it is bad, look for open
     fusable resistors or other fuses you did not catch.

  2. Assuming it is good, measure the voltage on the collector-emitter of the
     HOT (this is safe if there is no deflection). You should see the B+ of
     between 60 and 150 V (typical) depending on mode (for a multiscan
     monitor).

  3. If there is no voltage, you have a low voltage power supply problem
     and/or you have not found all the bad/open parts. The flyback primary
     winding may be open as well.

  4. If there is voltage and no deflection, you probably have a startup
     problem - all TVs need some kind of circuit to kick start the horizontal
     deflection until the auxiliary power outputs of the flyback are
     available. Some designs use a simple multivibrator for this - a couple
     of transistors. Others power the horizontal oscillator IC from a special
     line-derived voltage.

     Look for pulses at the HOT base. If there are none, trace back to the
     driver and oscillator. Most likely: the power for startup is missing.

     Test the transistors if it is that type with an ohmmeter. If one is
     shorted, you have a problem. The usual way a TV service person would
     test for startup problems is to inject a signal to the base of the HOT
     of about 15.75 KHz. If the TV then starts and runs once this signal is
     removed, the diagnosis is confirmed. This is very risky for monitors and
     I would not recommend it - you can all too easily blow things up if not
     careful (including yourself).

If you hear the high pitched whine of the deflection (probably not for
workstation or SVGA computer monitors unless you are a bat) and/or feel some
static on the scree, confirm that the horizontal deflection and high voltage
are working by adjusting the SCREEN control (probably on the flyback). If you
can get a raster then your problem is probably in the video (or chroma)
circuits, not the deflection or high voltage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.9 "Monitor mostly dead, possible whine from power supply"

Note that this may be perfectly normal for your monitor if there is no video
input - confirm that there is a signal that is compatible with the monitor's
scan rate(s) and sync. Make sure the sync selection is set appropriately as
well.

This may indicate an overloaded low voltage switching power supply. The whine
is caused by the switching power supply's chopper frequency dropping down due
to the overload.

Test the B+ to the horizontal deflection circuits (B+ input to the flyback).

If it is near zero, test the HOT for shorts and replace but continue testing
with a series light bulb and/or Variac. There may be something causing the
HOT to go bad like a shorted flyback or bad damper diode or snubber cap.

If the voltage is not zero but is low (e.g., it should be 120 V but is only
60 V), there may be a problem with:

  1. Defective low voltage power supply. Test with a substitute load like a
     40 W light bulb or power resistor. If the supply now outputs full
     voltage, it is probably fine. For a power resistor, select a value such
     that the load at the expected voltage will be about 1/2 to 2/3 of the
     nameplate power rating of the monitor. Make sure the resistor can handle
     this power dissipation!

  2. Flyback (LOPT) transformer - shorted windings. See the section:
	 @{"Testing of flyback (LOPT) transformers" link "9.22"}

  3. Deflection yoke - shorted turns in the horizontal or geometry correction
     windings. Unplug the yoke if possible and very slowly bring up the
     monitor on a Variac. Be careful - if you now get high voltage, you may
     get a very bright spot in the center of the screen which will quickly
     turn to a very dark spot in the center of the screen - turn the screen
     (G2) control down and don't run in this state for more than a few
     seconds. The problem may not be in the yoke but in the circuitry around
     it. Quickly test the B+. It will probably now be normal.

     With the yoke connected, use an oscilloscope to monitor the collector of
     the HOT using a Variac to bring up the voltage slowly. This is safe
     since you will not be going to full B+ - just enough to look at the
     signal shape (don't let the collector signal go over a couple hundred
     volts). The waveform should be a clean pulse during retrace and nearly
     zero during active video. Ideally it will look like a sinusoidal
     positive half cycle. If there are dips, serious ringing, or other
     uglies, then there is likely a fault in the flyback, horizontal
     deflection coils, or associated circuitry. Pull off the yoke connector
     and repeat. If it is now clean, suspect the yoke or other components
     directly connected to it (geometry correction coils, caps, etc.).

     If you suspect the yoke perform a 'ring test'. See the section:
	 @{"Testing of flyback (LOPT) transformers" link "9.22"} since similar techniques
	 may be used.

  4. Excess load on one of the flyback's secondaries. Disconnect all
     secondary output pins from the flyback if possible and see if your B+
     returns to normal. Of course, much of the monitor will not work without
     these power supplies. You will then need to test the components in each
     of these supplies and/or reconnected them one by one.

  5. Improper drive to HOT. Inspect with an oscilloscope. The drive should
     match the video input - its frequency should match the horizontal rate
     with a high time equal to the active video - typically 75-85% of the
     total line time. If it is on for too long, or of incorrect frequency,
     the output will not be correct and there may be excessive load on the
     low voltage power supply.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.10 "Reduced width picture and/or hum bars in picture"

The most likely cause is a dried up main filter capacitor. Once the effective
capacitance drops low enough, 120 Hz (or 100 Hz in countries with 50 Hz
power) ripple will make its way into the regulated DC supply (assuming full
wave rectification).

Another likely cause of similar symptoms is a defective low voltage regulator
allowing excessive ripple. The regulator IC could be bad or filter capacitor
following the IC could be dried up.

Either of these faults may cause:

  1. A pair of wiggles and/or hum bars in the picture which will float up the
     screen. For NTSC where the power line is 60 Hz but the frame rate is
     59.94 Hz, it will take about 8 seconds for each bar to pass a given
     point on the screen. (On some sets, a half wave recitifier is used
     resulting in a single wiggle or hum bar).

     For high scan rate computer monitors, the this may result in horizontal
     hum bars, wiggles, or other distortions that will drift up or down the
     screen based on the difference frequency between the power line and
     video refresh rate being supplied by the PC or workstation. A
     confirmation can be obtained by varying the scan rate and seeing if the
     rate of drift changes predictably.

  2. Possible regulation problems resulting in HV or total shutdown or power
     cycling on and off.

The best approach to testing the capacitors is to clip a good capacitor of
approximately the same uF rating and at least the same voltage rating across
the suspect capacitor (with the power off). A capacitor meter can also be
used but the capacitor may need to be removed from the circuit.

Once the capacitors have been confirmed to be good, voltage measurements on
the regulator should be able to narrow down the problem to a bad IC or other
component.

@node 8.11 "Dead monitor with periodic tweet-tweet-tweet or flub-flub-flub"

A monitor which appears to be dead except for a once a second or so tweet or
flub usually indicates a fault in the switching power supply - often a
shorted rectifier. The HFR854s (one common type in monitors) or other high
speed high efficiency rectifiers in the output side of the switching power
supply seem to like to turn into short circuits. (I had a couple of DOA
monitors where this was the problem. so much for quality control!)

After unplugging the monitor and waiting a few minutes for the filter
capacitors to discharge (check with a voltmeter but stay away from the CRT HV
connector as it may retain a dangerous and painful charge for a long time),
use an ohmmeter across the various diodes in the power supply. These appear
commonly as black cylinders about 3/8" long by 1/4 diameter. (Kind of like
1N400Xs on steroids). The resistance of the diodes in at least one direction
should be greater than 100 ohms. If it is much less (like 0 or 5 ohms), then
the diode is probably bad. Unsolder and check again - it should test infinite
(greater than 1M ohms) in one direction. If it now tests good, there may be
something else that is shorted.

Replacements are available for about $.25 from places like MCM Electronics.

Check other power semiconductors as well, in particular, the horizontal
output transistor.

Other possible causes: bad solder connections, other shorted components like
capacitors, other problems in the power supply. Sometimes this is an
indication of an overvoltage shutdown due to a faulty regulator or open load.

This could also be due to other shorted components such as the horizontal
output transistor where there is a separate switching power supply as well as
faults in the overcurrent or overvoltage circuitry of the power supply or its
controller chip.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.12 "Monitor power cycling on and off"

The power light may be flashing or if you are runing with a series light bulb
it may be cycling on and off continuously. There may be a chirping or
clicking sound from inside the set. (Note: using too small a light bulb for
the size of the monitor may also result in this condition.)

If there is a low voltage regulator or separate switching supply, it could be
cycling on and off if the horizontal output, flyback, or one of its secondary
loads were defective.

Does this monitor have a separate low voltage regulator and/or switching
power supply or is it all part of the flyback circuit? For the following, I
assume it is all in one.

Some simple things to try first:

Verify that the main filter capacitor is doing its job. Excessive ripple on
the rectified line voltage bus can cause various forms of shutdown behavior.
An easy test is to jumper across the capacitor with one of at least equal
voltage rating and similar capacitance (make connections with power off!).

Use a Variac, if possible, to bring up the input voltage slowly and see if
the monitor works at any point without shutting down. If it does, this could
be an indication of X-ray protection circuit kicking in, though this will
usually latch and keep the set shut off if excessive HV were detected.

Since the monitor is not totally dead - there are some signs of life - the
once a second or so tweet or flup - this often means that the switching power
supply has a short in one of its load circuits, very often a shorted
rectifier. It could also be the flyback, but check the the loads first. Wait
a few minutes for the filter caps to discharge (but stay away from the CRT HV
connector as it may retain a dangerous and painful charge for a long time),
use an ohmmeter across the various diodes in the power supply. Using an
ohmmeter on the rectifier diodes, the resistance in at least one direction
should be greater than 100 ohms. If it is much less (like 0 or 5 ohms), then
the diode is probably bad. Unsolder and check again - it should test infinite
(greater than 1M ohms) in one direction.

Other possible causes:

   o Bad solder connections.
   o Other shorted components like capacitors.
   o Other problems in the power supply.
   o Bad flyback.
   o Short or excessive load on secondary supplies fed from flyback.
   o Problem with startup drive (cycling on overvoltage).

@node 8.13 "Shorted Components"

A failure of the horizontal output transistor or power supply switchmode
transistor will blow a fuse or fusable resistor.

Look for blown fuses and test for open fusable resistors in the power
circuits. If you find one, then test the HOT and/or switchmode transistor for
shorts.

Other possibilities: rectifier diodes or main filter capacitor.

While you are at it, check for bad connections - prod the circuit board with
an insulated stick when the problem reoccurs - as these can cause parts to
fail.

@endnode
@node 8.14 "Startup problems - nothing happens, click, or tick-tick-tick sound"

TVs and monitors usually incorporate some kind of startup circuit to provide
drive to the horizontal output transistor (HOT) until the flyback power
supply is running. Yes, TVs and monitors boot just like computers.

There are two typical kinds of symptoms: power on click but nothing else
happens or a tick-tick-tick sound indicating cycling of the low voltage (line
regulator) but lack of startup horizontal drive.

Check the voltage on the horizontal output transistor (HOT). If no voltage is
present, there may be a blown fuse or open fusable resistor - and probably a
shorted HOT.

However, if the voltage is normal (or high) - usually 60-150 V depending on
scan rate (for a multiscan monitor), then there is likely a problem with the
startup circuit not providing initial base drive to the HOT.

The startup circuits may take several forms:

  1. Discrete multivibrator or other simple transistor circuit to provide
     base drive to the HOT.

  2. IC which is part of deflection chain powered off of a voltage divider or
     transformer.

  3. Other type of circuit which operates off of the line which provides some
     kind of drive to the HOT.

The startup circuit may operate off of the standby power supply or voltage
derived from non-isolated input. Be careful - of course, use an isolation
transformer whenever working on TVs and especially for power supply problems.

Note that one common way of verifying that this is a startup problem is to
inject a 15 KHz signal directly into the HOT base or driver circuit (just for
a second or two). If the TV then starts up and continues to run, you know
that it is a startup problem.

Caution: be careful if you do this. The HOT circuit may be line-connected and
it is possible to destroy the HOT and related components if this is not done
properly. I once managed to kill not only the HOT but the chopper transistor
as well while working in this area. An expensive lesson.

I have also seen startup circuits that were designed to fail. Turning the TV
on and off multiple times would exceed the power ratings of the components in
the startup circuit. Some Zenith models have this 'feature'.

When this situation exists, it could be that the circuit is not providing the
proper drive or that due to some other circuit condition, the drive is not
always sufficient to get the secondary supplies going to the point that the
normal circuits take over.

I would still check for bad connections - prod the circuit board with an
insulated stick when the problem reoccurs.

@node 8.15 "Monitor turns off after warming up"

If you can turn it back on with the s momentary key or power button:

When it shuts off, do you need to push the power button once or twice to get
it back on? Also, does anything else about the picture or sound change as it
warms up?

  1. If once, then the controller is shutting the TV down either as a result
     of a (thermally induced) fault in the controller or it sensing some
     other problem. Monitoring the voltage on the relay coil (assuming these
     is one) could help determine what is happening. The controller thinks it
     is in charge.

  2. If twice, then the power supply is shutting down as the controller still
     thinks it is on and you are resetting it. A couple of possibilities here
     would be low voltage or high voltage regulation error (excessive high
     voltage is sensed and causes shutdown to prevent dangerous X-ray
     emission). A partially dried up main filter capacitor could also cause a
     shutdown but there might be other symptoms like hum bars in the picture
     just before this happened. Clipping a good capacitor across the suspect
     (with power off!) would confirm or eliminate this possibility.

If it uses a hard on/off switch, then this may be like pulling the plug and
would reset any abnormal condition.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.16 "Monitor doesn't power up immediately"

The monitor may do nothing, cycle on and off for a while, power up and then
shutdown in an endless cycle - or at least for a while. Then it comes on and
operates normally until it is turned off.

A couple of possibilities:

  1. The main filter capacitor or other filter capacitors in the low voltage
     power supply is dried up and this can cause all kinds of regulation
     problems.

  2. The power supply regulator is defective (or marginal) allowing excessive
     voltage on its output and then the X-ray protection circuitry shuts you
     down.

If you can get access to a Variac, it would be worth bringing up the input
voltage slowly and seeing if there is some point at which it would stay on.

If there is, then if the picture has serious hum bars in it the main filter
cap could be bad. If more or less a decent picture with minor hum bars then
it could be the regulator.

@node 8.17 "Old monitor requires warmup period"

So, what else is new? In the old days, a TV or monitor was expected to take a
few minutes (at least) to warm up. We are all spoiled today. Of course, you
usually maintained a full time technician or engineer to fiddle with the
convergence adjustments!

If it just takes a while for the picture to become as bright as you like,
this is probably just a result of an old tired CRT (see the sections:
@{"Monitor life, energy conservation, and laziness" link "13.8"} and @{"Brightening a CRT" link "11.12"}.
If, however, nothing happens for a few minutes, then some component needs to
be powered for a while before it starts cooperatings. This is probably a dried
up capacitor in the power supply since that is drifting with temperature and
needs to be located with cold spray or a heat gun.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.18 "Power supply interactions"

This describes problems like turning up the brightness causes a loss of sync
or adjusting height also affects width.

These may be caused by poor regulation in one or more low voltage power
supplies or and interaction between the high voltage and low voltage power
supplies - possibly a dried up capacitor if it is relatively old, bad
connections, or another faulty component. Measure the B+ to the horizontal
deflection (to the flyback, not the horizontal output transistor). If it is
changing with the problem, then a regulation problem is confirmed. If this
voltage is solid, you will need to check the others to see which one is
actually changing.

@endnode
@node 8.19 "Relays in the Power Circuitry of monitors"

What exactly is the purpose of such a relay ... i.e., why doesn't the power
switch on the monitor just apply power directly instead of through a relay?

On a TV, the usual reason for a relay instead of a knob switch is to permit a
remote control to turn power on and off. If your TV does not have a remote,
then it is simply the same chassis minus 24 cents worth of circuitry to do
the remote function. Isn't marketing wonderful?

On a monitor without any remote control, there can be two likely reasons:

  1. Reduce the needed capacity of the on/off switch. High resolution
     monitors do consume a fair amount of power. A soft touch button may be
     more elegant or cheaper.

  2. Allow for automatic power saving 'green' operation.

When replacing a relay, only unknown is the coil voltage. It is probably
somewhere in the 6-12 volt range. You should be able to measure this on the
coil terminals in operation. It will be a DC coil.

However, the relay controls the 125 VAC (or 220) which you should treat with
respect - it is a lot more dangerous than the 25KV+ on the CRT!

Almost certainly, the relay will have 4 connections - 2 for power and 2 for
the coil. If it is not marked then, it should be pretty easy to locate the
power connection. One end will go to stuff near the AC line and the other end
will go to the rectifier or maybe a fusable resistor or something like that.
These will likely be beefier than the coil connections which will go between
a transistor and GND or some low voltage, or maybe directly into a big
microcontroller chip.

Of course, the best thing would be to get the schematic but with monitors
this may not be easy.

Once you are sure of the AC connections - measure across them while it is off
and also while it is on. While off, you should get 110-125 VAC. While on and
working - 0. While on and not working either 110-125 VAC if the relay is not
pulling in or 0 if it is and the problem is elsewhere. We can deal with the
latter case if needed later on. Note the even if the relay contacts are not
working, the problem could still be in the control circuitry not providing
the correct coil voltage/current, though not likely.

It may be expensive and/or difficult to obtain an exact replacement, but
these are pretty vanilla flavored as relays go. Any good electronics
distributor should be able to supply a suitable electrical replacement though
you may need to be creative in mounting it.

@endnode
@node 8.20 "What is a posistor?"

A posistor is a combination of a PTC (positive temperature coefficient)
resistor and another resistor-element to heat it up and keep it hot.
Sometimes, these will go by the name posister or thermister. The heater is a
disk shaped resistor across the power line and the themister is a disk shaped
device in series with the degauss coil. They are in clamped together to be in
close contact thermally. You can pry off the lid and see for yourself.

The most common failure mode is for the part to short across the line.

Its function is to control degauss, so the only thing you lose when you
remove one of these is the degauss function on power-on. When you turn the TV
or monitor on, the PTC resistor is cold and low resistance. When heated, it
becomes very high resistance and turns off the degauss coil but gradually -
the current ramps down to zero rather than being abruptly cut off..

Computer Component Source stocks a wide variety, I believe but it may be
cheaper to go direct to the manufacturer if they will sell you one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 8.21 "Flameproof Resistors"

Flameproof Resistor or Fusable Resistor are often designated by the symbol
'FR'. They are the same.

You may see these in the switchmode power supplies used in TVs and monitors.
They will look like power resistors but will be colored blue or gray, or may
be rectangular ceramic blocks. They should only be replaced with flameproof
resistors with identical ratings. They serve a very important safety
function.

These usually serve as fuses in addition to any other fuses that may be
present (and in addition to their function as a resistor, though this isn't
always needed). Since your FR has blown, you probably have shorted
semiconductors that will need to be replaced as well. I would check all the
transistors and diodes in the power supply with an ohmmeter. You may find
that the main switch mode transistor has decided to turn into a blob of
solder - dead short. Check everything out even if you find one bad part -
many components can fail or cause other components to fail if you don't
locate them all. Check resistors as well, even if they look ok.

Then, with a load on the output of the power supply use a Variac to bring up
the voltage slowly and observe what happens. At 50 VAC or less, the switcher
should kick in and produce some output though correct regulation may not
occur until 80 VAC or more. The outputs voltages may even be greater than
spec'd with a small load before regulation is correct.

@endnode
@node 9.1 "Deflection fundamentals"

The electron beams in the CRT need to be scanned horizontally and vertically
in a very precise manner to produce a raster - and a picture.

For NTSC and PAL, the horizontal scan rates are 15,734 and 15,625 Hz
respectively, the vertical scan rates are 60 and 50 Hz (approximately)
respectively.

For PCs and workstation monitors, a wide range of scan rates are used.

For example:


      Standard      Horizontal, KHz  Vertical, Hz
    ------------------------------------------------
	MDA               18.43           50
	CGA               15.75           60
	EGA               15.75-21.85     60
	VGA               31.4            60-70
	SVGA (800x600)    35-40           50-75+
	SVGA (1024x768)   43-52+          43-75+  
	SVGA (1280x1024)  64-72+          60-75+
	Workstations      64-102+         60-76+

Even in high resolution fixed frequency monitors, these high horizontal (in
particular) scan rates necessitate some fancy circuit design. All components
are running under stressful conditions and it is amazing that failures are
not more common.

With multiscan monitors, the complexity of the circuits increases
dramatically to accommodate the wide range of horizontal scan rates. Relays
or electronic switches are used to select power supply voltages, tuning
components, and to make other alternations in the deflection circuits to
handle DOS VGA one minute and Autocad 1280x1024 the next. It comes as no
surprise that the most stressful time for a monitor is when switching scan
rates.

Unfortunately, successfully diagnosing problems dealing with the scan
switching logic and circuitry is virtually impossible without a schematic.

The deflection yoke includes sets of coils for horizontal and vertical
scanning oriented at 90 degrees with respect to each other. Additional coils
are needed to correct for pincushion and other geometric defects.

The deflection circuits must be synchronized and phase locked to the incoming
video signal.

Therefore, we have the following functions:

  1. Sync separator to obtain horizontal and vertical synchronization pulses
     for monitors with composite video or sync inputs. Input sync detectors
     and auto polarity switching circuits as needed for separate horizontal
     and vertical sync inputs.

  2. Horizontal oscillator which locks to horizontal sync pulses.

  3. Horizontal drive followed by horizontal output which feeds deflection
     yoke (and flyback for HV and other voltages), Yoke requires a sawtooth
     current waveform for linear horizontal deflection. Horizontal output in
     all but the smaller TVs or monitors is a large discrete power
     transistor, most often an NPN bipolar type.

  4. Vertical oscillator which locks to vertical sync pulses. Yoke requires
     sawtooth waveform for linear vertical deflection.

  5. Vertical drive/output which feeds vertical deflection yoke. Newer TVs
     and monitors use ICs for vertical drive and output.

  6. Various additional deflection signals to correct for the imperfections
     in the geometry of large angle deflection CRTs. These may be fed into
     the normal deflection coils and/or there may be separate coils mounted
     on the neck of the CRT.

  7. Multiscan deflection control and selection circuitry (multiscan monitors
     only), probably controlled by a microprocessor which stores scan
     parameters for each scan rate and automatically detects the appropriate
     settings to use by analyzing the input video. For horizontal deflection,
     the usual way of size constant regardless of scan rate is to scale the
     B+ to the HOT with horizontal frequency. Thus, VGA resolution may us 60
     V B+ while 1280x1024 at 75 Hz may require 150 V. Various other
     components may need to be selected based on scan rate. Relays are often
     used for this selection since they are easy to control and can handle
     the voltages and currents in the various deflection circuits reliably.

@endnode
@node 9.2 "Gross problems in size or position at certain scan rates"

First, make sure you are not specifying incorrect scan rate for your monitor.
Check your video card setup and/or monitor selection in Win95.

Assuming you are not violating the scan rate specifications but have a
picture that is twice the height of the screen and one half the width, for
example, this could indicate a failure in the scan rate switching circuitry
of a multiscan monitor. Either the logic is faulty and ordering the wrong
selections for power supply voltage and tuning components or the relays or
the relevant parts are faulty. This could be due to bad connections as well -
quite likely in fact. Also, try to reset the afflicted parameters using the
digital controls (if relevant) and confirm that your video card is putting
out the correct scan rate - try another monitor or examine the video signals
with an oscilloscope.

Try prodding the circuit boards with an insulated stick - this may identify
bad connections or unstick a sticky relay.

A schematics will likely be needed to proceed further with these sorts of
problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.3 "Can incorrect or missing video damage my monitor?"

The short answer is - quite possibly. Don't push your luck.

Mostly, there are problems at scan rates which exceed the monitor's
specifications. However, some poorly designed monitors or just a particular
combination of events can blow a monitor with too low a scan rate or an
absent or corrupted signal input. There was one case where a very expensive
high performance monitor would consistently blow its horizontal deflection
circuits when driven by a particular ATI video card. It turned out that
during the power-on self test of the ATI BIOS, just the wrong video timing
was being generated for a fraction of a second - but that was enough.

As far as scan rate limits, there is no way of knowing - it really all
depends on the quality of the design of your monitor. Some will happily run
continuously at 25% above specifications. Other will blow out totally at the
first excuse.

The specification that is likely to be more critical is the horizontal rate
as it probably puts more stress on the components than the vertical rate. I
have found that as you approach the upper limits, there is a good chance that
the geometric accuracy of the raster near the top of the screen may start to
deteriorate due to lock in problems as well. However, it would be foolhardy
to depend on this sort of behavior as an indication of going over the edge.

It will be much too late when you find out. If the manual says 75 Hz V and 64
KHz H, stay below **both** of these. If you exceed the safe ratings and the
design isn't really good, there is the possibility of blowing components in
the horizontal deflection and high voltage sections which will result in
expensive repair bills. You will likely get no warning of impending failure.
In addition, even if the monitor does not immediately turn into a pile of
smoking silicon and plastic, components may be under more stress and running
at higher levels of power dissipation. Total failure may be just around the
corner. More subtle degradation in performance may occur over time as well.

You won't see the difference anyhow beyond 75 Hz and your programs may run
slightly faster at lower refresh rates since the video is not using as much
bandwidth (however, the difference here may be very slight or non-existent
depending on your board, computer, applications, etc..

@endnode
@node 9.4 "Why are nearly all horizontal drivers circuits transformer coupled?"

One (probably secondary) reason is that this provides one of the isolation
barriers between a line-connected HOT and flyback primary and the signal
circuits of the TV.

A more important rational is that a transformer is nice easy way of impedance
matching the horizontal driver circuit (100s to 1000s of ohms) to the few ohm
input impedance of the horizontal output transistor base which requires
upwards of several amps for proper drive. A typical driver transformer may be
in the 5-10:1 turns ratio representing 25-100:1 impedance ratio.

A byproduct of all this is that it is unlikely for a faulty driver stage to
kill the HOT. Unlikely but not impossible.

You were happily playing 'Doom' when the sides of the picture squeezed in two

much time, effort, and expense to fix?

No, it's not dead, at least it certainly is not the picture tube.

Your probably shot the monitor instead of the bad guys!

Is there any indication of light on the screen? Any indication of the
horizontal deflection running at all as evidenced by static on the screen?

In any case, there is a problem in the horizontal deflection and you probably
have no high voltage as well assuming no light on the screen.

The fact that it squeezed in first indicates that a partial short or other
fault may have developed in the horizontal deflection circuits - possibly the
deflection yoke or flyback transformer. It could also have been a bad
connection letting loose. Once it failed completely, the horizontal output
transistor may have bought the farm or blown a fuse.

@node 9.6 "Horizontal deflection shutting down"

Confirm that the horizontal deflection is shutting down (along with the high

pitched deflection whine (NTSC/PAL/CGA), test for static on the screen, see
if the CRT filaments are lit, turn up the brightness and/or screen control to
see if you can get a raster) and then why:

  1. Power is failing to the horizontal output transistor - this could be due
     to a low voltage power supply problem, bad connection, etc.

  2. Base drive to the horizontal output transistor is failing - could be a
     fault in the horizontal oscillator or bad connection.

  3. Problem with the flyback transformer or its secondary loads (flyback may
     provide other power voltages).

  4. X-ray protection is activating - either due to excess HV or due to a
     fault in the X-ray protection circuitry.

If the problem comes and goes erratically it sounds like a bad connection,
especially if whacking has an effect. If it comes and goes periodically, then
a component could be heating up and failing, then cooling, etc.

@endnode
@node 9.7 "Horizontal lock lost"

A monitor which loses horizontal lock when changing resolutions, momentarily
losing the signal, or switching inputs may have a horizontal oscillator that
is way out of adjustment or has drifted in frequency due to aging components.
Alternatively, you may be running at scan rates that are not supported by
your monitor. Check its user manual (yeh, right, like you have it!). Use the
setup program that came with your video card to adjust the default scan rates
to match the monitor. Not only will it lock better, you are less likely to
damage the monitor by feeding it improper scan rates.

Note that the characteristics of this are distinctly different than for total
loss of sync. In the latter case, the picture will drift sideways and/or up
and down while with an off frequency oscillator, the torn up picture will try
at least to remain stationary.

Assuming you are have your video card set up properly - double check anyhow -
this could be a capacitor or other similar part. Or, the oscillator frequency
may just need to be tweaked (particularly with older monitors). There may be
an internal horizontal frequency adjustment - either a pot or a coil - which
may need a slight tweak. If a coil, use a plastic alignment tool, not metal
to avoid cracking the fragile core. There may be several adjustments for
multiscan monitors - one for each major scan range.

A schematic will be useful to locate the adjustment if any or to identify
possible defective parts. If it is a heat related problem try cold spray or a
heat gun in an effort localize the offending part.

@node 9.8 "Horizontal squashed"

A very narrow picture may indicate problems with the power supply to the

If the size is erratic and/or gently whacking the monitor makes the width
change, bad connections are likely. See the section:
@{"Monitor manufacturing quality and cold solder joints" link "11.4"}

Confirm that your video card is running at the proper scan rate -
particularly that it is not violating the monitor's specifications. An
excessive horizontal scan rate is a common cause of a reduced width raster.
Try its software setup adjustments as these may have been lost.

Beyond this, a schematic will probably be needed to isolate the fault.

A sudden change in linearity or a monitor that requires a warmup period

cold spray or a heatgun to see if you can locate the bad part.

This is a vertical deflection problem - possibly a bad capacitor, bad
connection, or other component. None of these should be very expensive (in a
relative sort of way).

Start by substituting a good capacitor for each electrolytic in the vertical
output circuit. Look for bad connections (particularly to the deflection
yoke), then consider replacing the vertical output IC or transistor(s).

The following are NOT possible: CRT or flyback. (I am just trying to think of
really expensive parts that cannot possibly be at fault).

@node 9.11 "Picture size changing"

If the picture area is expanding or contracting without any changes to your
video card settings or other software. then there is a problem with the power
supplies in the monitor. This would be confirmed if the change is (1) gradual
over the course of say, an hour, and/or (2) gently whacking the monitor has
some effect indicating bad internal connections. Software problems would not
result in either of these characteristics.

Note that if the change is very small - say, less than 1 or 2%, then it may
simply be normal for your monitor due to poor design or the use of inferior
components - some parts associated with power supply regulation may be
changing value as the monitors warms up.

A way to confirm that something is drifting due to thermal problems would be
the monitor from another computer and see if the same thing happens. Just
powering the monitor by itself (but not in any power saving mode) might also
work for this test.

One possible cause could be that the high voltage is drifting gradually due
to a faulty component - increasing and making the beam 'stiffer' or
vice-versa. If this is the case there might also be a gradual change in
brightness as well (decreasing image size -> increase in brightness).
Alternatively, the HV may be stable but the power to both H and V deflection
is gradually changing.

Excess high voltage can increase the X-ray emissions and any kind of power
supply problems may ultimately result in total failure and an expensive
repair. Therefore, these symptoms should not be ignored. See the sections on
@{"low voltage" link "8"} and @{"high voltage" link "10"} power supply problems.

@endnode
@node 9.12 "Replicated or offset multiple images"

Multiple images on the screen horizontally or vertically indicate that the
scan rate is way off (by a factor equal to the number of complete pictures.)
This could be a fault in the monitor or you could be running way outside of
the monitor's specifications. Even slightly exceeding these for the
horizontal or vertical may confuse the scan rate selection logic and result
in the monitor setting itself with incorrect scan rate settings.

A situation where successive sweeps alternate position slightly resulting in
double or triple images may be caused by a incorrect or out of range video
timing, a bad component, or improper sync signals.

Check the settings of the video card and any sync termination or selection on
the monitor. Beyond this, a schematic will be required.

@endnode
@node 9.13 "Part of picture cut off"

The following applies if the part of the picture is missing but not otherwise
squashed or distorted. For example, 85% is missing but the portion still
visible is normal size.

Wow! That's an interesting one, more so than the typical run-of-the-mill "my
TV just up and died on me". Or, "my pet orangutan just put a hole in the CRT,
what should I do"?

With a monitor, this is more likely than a TV. But the cause is probably not
in the monitor (though not impossible). Check that your video parameters are
set up correctly (particularly if you have full control of them as with
Linux). You may have set the active too short or blanking too long.

If your video is confirmed to be ok (looking at it with an oscilloscope would
be best), then with the size of the picture fragment correct but 85% missing,
check waveforms going into the vertical output stage. The supply voltage is
probably correct since that often determines the size. It almost sounds like
the waveform rather than being mostly on (active video) and off for the short
blanking period is somehow only on during the last part of the active video
thus giving you just the bottom of the picture. If there is a vertical output
IC, it may be defective or the blanking input to it may be corrupted. The
problem may be as far back as the sync separator. Then again who knows,
schematics would be really handy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.14 "Bright blurry bars on edge of picture"

This may be due to improper video timing. You may be seeing part of the
active video during retrace. Horizontal timing problems would produce
vertical bars on the right or left edge; vertical timing problems would
produce horizontal bars at the top or bottom edge.

If your video card permits control of video timing parameters, try reducing
the relevant active time relative to the blanking period. If this does not
work, your video card may be incompatible with the monitor.

If the problem just happened without any changes to the video source, the
monitor may have a problem in its deflection circuits - coil or capacitor, a
power supply fault, position or size settings or control, or deflection yoke.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.15 "Single Vertical Line"

Since you have high voltage, the horizontal deflection circuits are almost
certainly working (unless there is a separate high voltage power supply -
almost unheard of in modern TVs and very uncommon in all but the most
expensive monitors).

Check for bad solder connections between the main board and the deflection
yoke. Could also be a bad horizontal coil in the yoke, linearity coil, etc.
There is not that much to go bad based on these symptoms assuming the high
voltage and the horizontal deflection use the same flyback. It is almost
certainly not an IC or transistor that is bad.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.16 "Single Horizontal Line"

A single horizontal line means that you have lost vertical deflection. High
voltage is most likely fine since there is something on the screen.

This could be due to:

  1. Dirty service switch contacts. There is often a small switch on the
     located inside on the main board or perhaps accessible from the back.
     This is used during setup to set the color background levels. When
     flipped to the 'service' position, it kills vertical deflection and
     video to the CRT. If the switch somehow changed position or got dirty or
     corroded contacts, you will have this symptom. Flip the switch back and
     forth a couple of times. If there is some change, then replace, clean,
     resolder, or even bypass it as appropriate.

  2. Bad connection to deflection yoke or other parts in vertical output
     circuit. Bad connections are common in TVs and monitors. Check around
     the pins of large components like transformers, power transistors and
     resistors, or connectors for hairline cracks in the solder. Reseat
     internal connectors. Check particularly around the connector to the
     deflection yoke on the CRT.

  3. Bad vertical deflection IC or transistor. You will probably need the
     service manual for this and the following. However, if the vertical
     deflection is done with an IC, the ECG Semiconductor Master Substitution
     guide may have its pinout which may be enough to test it with a scope.

  4. Other bad parts in vertical deflection circuit though there are not that
     many parts that would kill the deflection entirely.

  5. Loss of power to vertical deflection circuits. Check for blown fusable
     resistors/fuses and bad connections.

  6. Loss of vertical oscillator or vertical drive signals.

The most likely possibilities are in the deflection output stage or bad
connections to the yoke.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.17 "Loss of horizontal sync (also applies to vertical) after warmup"

The problem lies either in the horizontal oscillator or in the sync system.
If it really is a problem with sync pulses not reaching the oscillator, the
picture will move around horizontally and can be brought to hold momentarily
with the hold control. If the picture breaks up into strips, there is a
problem in the horizontal oscillator. If there is an accessible hold control
try rotating it: if the frequency is too far off, the picture will not settle
into place at any adjustment of the hold control. Look around the horizontal
oscillator circuit: all of the oscillator parts will be right there, or check
on the horizontal oscillator module. If only one resolution on a multiscan
monitor is affected, the there could be a separate oscillator circuit for
each range.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.18 "Intermittent jumping or jittering of picture or other random behavior"

This has all the classic symptoms of a loose connection internal to the TV or
monitor - probably where the deflection yoke plugs into the main PCB or at
the base of the flyback transformer. TVs and monitors are notorious for both
poor quality soldering and bad connections near high wattage components which
just develop over time from temperature cycling.

The following is not very scientific, but it works: Have you tried whacking
the TV when this happened and did it have any effect? If yes, this would be
further confirmation of loose connections.

What you need to do is examine the solder connections on the PCBs in the
monitor, particularly in the area of the deflection circuits and power
supply. Look for hairline cracks between the solder and the component pins -
mostly the fat pins of transformers, connectors, and high wattage resistors.
Any that are found will need to be reflowed with a medium wattage (like 40W)
or temperature controlled soldering iron.

It could also be a component momentarily breaking down in the power supply or
deflection circuits.

Another possibility is that there is arcing or corona as a result of humid
weather. This could trigger the power supply to shut down perhaps with a
squeak, but there would probably be additional symptoms including possibly
partial loss of brightness or focus before it shut down. You may also hear a
sizzling sound accompanied by noise or snow in the picture, static in the
sounds, and/or a smell of ozone.

If your AC power fluctuates, an inexpensive monitor may not be well enough
regulated and may pass the fluctuations on as jitter. The video card is
unlikely to be the cause of this jitter unless it correlates with computer
(software) activity.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.19 "Horizontal output transistors keep blowing"

Unfortunately, these sorts of problems are often difficult to definitively
diagnose and repair and often result in much expensive component swapping.

You have just replaced an obviously blown (shorted) horizontal output
transistor and an hour later, same symptoms:

Did the new transistor short?

Would the next logical step be a new flyback (LOPT)? Not necessarily.

If the monitor performed normally until it died, there are other possible
causes. However, it could be the flyback failing under load or when it warms
up. I would expect some warning though - like the picture shrinks for a few
seconds before the poof.

Other possible causes:

  1. Insufficient drive to horizontal output transistor (HOT). A weak drive
     would cause the HOT to either turn on or shut off too slowly greatly
     increasing heat dissipation. Check driver and HOT base circuit
     components.

  2. Excessive voltage on HOT collector - check LV regulator (and line
     voltage if this is a field repair), if any.

  3. Defective safety capacitors or damper diode around HOT. (Though this
     usually results in instant destruction with little heating).

  4. New transistor not mounted properly to heat sink - probably needs mica
     washer and heat sink compound.

  5. Replacement transistor not correct or inferior cross reference.
     Sometimes, the horizontal deflection is designed based on the quirks of
     a particular transistor. Substitutes may not work reliably.

With multiscan monitors, some of these parts may be switched in and out based
on scan range. Very tricky.

The HOT should not run hot - properly mounted to the heat sink, it should not
be too hot to touch (CAREFUL - don't touch with power on - it is at over a
hundred volts with nasty multihundred volt spikes and line connected -
discharge power supply filter caps first after unplugging). If it is
scorching hot after a few minutes, then you need to check the other
possibilities.

It is also possible that a defective flyback - perhaps one shorted turn -
would not cause an immediate failure and only affect the picture slightly.
This would be unusual, however. See the section:
@{"Testing of flyback (LOPT) transformers" link "9.22"}

Note that running the set with a series light bulb may allow the HOT to
survive long enough for you to gather some of the information needed to
identify the bad component.

@node 9.20 "Vertical foldover"

The picture is squashed vertically and a part of it may be flipped over and
distorted.

This usually indicates a fault in the vertical output circuit. If it uses an
IC for this, then the chip could be bad. It could also be a bad capacitor or
other component in this circuit. It is probably caused by a fault in the
flyback portion of the vertical deflection circuit - a charge pump that
generates a high voltage spike to return the beam to the top of the screen.

Test components in the vertical output stage or substitute for good ones.

Examine closely your electrolytic caps on the mother board for leaky ones.
Also look into your horz. circuitry to make sure signals and voltages are
correct. (Gary)

In particular, this sounds like a pincushion problem - to correct for
pincushion, a signal from the vertical deflection that looks something like a
rectified sinewave is used to modify width based on vertical position. There
is usually a control to adjust the magnitude of this signal and also often,
its phase. It would seem that this circuit has ceased to function. If you
have the schematics, check them for 'pincushion' adjustments and check
signals and voltages. If not, try to find the 'pincushion' magnitude and
phase adjustments and look for bad parts or bad connections in in the general
area. Even if there are no adjustment pots, there may still be pincushion
correction circuitry.

If the internal controls have absolutely no effect, then the circuit is
faulty. With modern digital setup adjustments, then it is even tougher to
diagnose since these control a D/A somewhere linked via a microprocessor.

Pincushion adjustment adds a signal to the horizontal deflection to
compensate for the geometry of the CRT/deflection yoke. If you have knobs,
then tracing the circuitry may be possible. With luck, you have a bad part
that can be identified with an ohmmeter - shorted or open. However, without a
schematic even this will be difficult. If the adjustments are digital this is
especially difficult to diagnose since you don't even have any idea of where
the circuitry would be located.

Faulty capacitors in the horizontal deflection power supplies often cause a
similar set of symptoms.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 9.22 "Testing of flyback (LOPT) transformers"

How and why do flyback transformers fail?

Flybacks fail in several ways:

  1. Overheating leading to cracks in the plastic and external arcing. These
     can often be fixed by cleaning and coating with multiple layers of high
     voltage sealer, corona dope, or even plastic electrical tape (as a
     temporary repair in a pinch).

  2. Cracked or otherwise damaged core will effect the flyback
     characteristics to the point where it may not work correctly or even
     blow the horizontal output transistor.

  3. Internal shorts in the FOCUS/SCREEN divider network, if present. One
     sign of this may be arcover of the FOCUS or SCREEN sparkgaps on the PCB
     on the neck of the CRT.

  4. Internal short circuits in the windings.

  5. Open windings.

More than one of these may apply in any given case.

First, perform a careful visual inspection with power off. Look for cracks,
bulging or melted plastic, and discoloration, Look for bad solder connections
at the pins of the flyback as well. If the TV or monitor can be powered
safely, check for arcing or corona around the flyback and in its vicinity,

Next, perform ohmmeter tests for obvious short circuits between windings,
much reduced winding resistances, and open windings.

For the low voltage windings, service manuals may provide the expected DC
resistance (SAMs PhotoFact, for example). Sometimes, this will change enough
to be detected - if you have an ohmmeter with a low enough scale. These are
usually a fraction of an ohm. It is difficult or impossible to measure the DC
resistance of the HV winding since the rectifiers are usually built in. The
value is not published either.

Caution: make sure you have the TV or monitor unplugged and confirm that the
main filter capacitor is discharged before touching anything! If you are
going to remove or touch the CRT HV, focus, or screen wires, discharge the HV
first using a well insulated high value resistor (e.g., several M ohms, 5 W)
to the CRT ground strap (NOT signal ground. See the section:
@{"Safe discharging of capacitors in TVs and video monitors" link "6.6"}

Partially short circuited windings (perhaps, just a couple of turns) and
sometimes shorts in the focus/screen divider will drastically lower the Q and
increase the load the flyback puts on its driving source with no outputs
connected. Commercial flyback testers measure the Q by monitoring the decay
time of a resonant circuit formed by a capacitor and a winding on the flyback
under test after it is excited by a pulse waveform. It is possible to easily
construct testers that perform a well. See the companion document "Testing of
Flyback (LOPT) Transformers" for further information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.1 "HV power supply fundamentals"

Most, monitors derive the high voltage for the CRT second anode (THE high
voltage, focus, and (sometimes) screen (G2) from the horizontal deflection
system. This technique was developed quite early in the history of commercial
TV and has stuck for a very simple reason - it is very cost effective. A side
effect is that if the horizontal deflection fails and threatens to burn a
(vertical) line into the CRT phosphors, the high voltage dies as well. Of
course, if the vertical deflection dies....

Some high end monitors utilize a separate high voltage supply. One reason for
this approach is to decouple the horizontal deflection from the HV in
multiscan monitors thus simplifying the design.

Usually it is a self contained invertor module. It if can be opened, then
repair may be possible. With a separate HV supply, there is no need for a HV
flyback transformer on the mainboard. Some designs may use a separate HV
supply including a flyback which is part of the mainboard but is self
contained and independent of the horizontal deflection system.

Most TV and monitor (flyback) high voltage supplies operate as follows:

  1. Horizontal output transistor (HOT) turns on during scan. Current
     increases linearly in primary of flyback transformer since it appears as
     an inductor. Magnetic field also increases linearly. Note: flyback is
     constructed with air gap in core. This makes it behave more like an
     inductor than transformer as far as the primary drive is concerned.

  2. HOT shuts off at end of scan. Current decreases rapidly. Magnetic field
     collapses inductively coupling to secondary and generates HV pulse.
     Inductance and capacitance of flyback, snubber capacitors, and parasitic
     capacitance of circuitry and yoke form a resonant circuit. Ideally,
     voltage waveform across HOT during flyback (retrace) period will be a
     single half cycle and is clamped by damper diode across HOT to prevent
     undershoot.

  3. Secondary of flyback is either a single large HV winding with HV
     rectifiers built in (most often) or an intermediate voltage winding and
     a voltage multiplier (see the section: @{"What is a tripler" link "10.2"}) The output
     will be DC HV pulses.

  4. The capacitance of the CRT envelope provides the needed filtering to
     adequately smooth the HV pulses into a DC voltage. Sometimes there is a
     separate HV capacitor as well.

  5. A high resistance voltage divider provides the several KV focus voltage
     and sometimes the several hundred volt screen (G2) voltage as well.
     Often, the adjustments for these voltages are built into the flyback.
     Sometimes they are mounted separately. This or a similar divider may
     also provide feedback to control high voltage regulation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.2 "What is a tripler?"

In some TVs and monitors, the flyback transformer only generates about 6-10
KV AC which is then boosted by a capacitor-diode ladder to the 18-30 KV
needed for modern color CRTs. The unit that does this is commonly called a
tripler since it multiplies the flyback output by about 3 times. Some TVs use
a quadrupler instead. However, many TVs and monitors generate the required HV
directly with a winding with the required number of turns inside the flyback
transformer.

Triplers use a diode-capacitor ladder to multiply the 6-10 KV AC to 18-30 KV
DC. Many triplers are separate units, roughly cubical, and are not
repairable. Some triplers are built in to the flyback - it is probably
cheaper to manufacture the HV diodes and capacitors than to wind a direct
high voltage secondary on the flyback core. In either case, failure requires
replacement of the entire unit.

For external multipliers, the terminals are typically marked:

   o IN - from flyback (6-10 KV AC).
   o OUT - HV to CRT (20-30 KV DC).
   o F - focus to CRT (2-8 KV).
   o CTL - focus pot (many megohm to ground).
   o G, GND, or COM - ground.

Symptoms of tripler failure are: lack of high voltage or insufficient high
voltage, arcing at focus protection spark gap, incorrect focus voltage, other
arcing, overload of HOT and/or flyback, or focus adjustment affecting
brightness (screen) setting or vice-versa.

High voltage shutdown due to X-ray protection circuits: A monitor that runs
for a while or starts to come on but then shuts down may have a problem with
the X-ray protection circuitry correctly or incorrectly determining that the
high voltage (HV) is too great (risking excessive X-ray emission) and
shutting everything down.

A side effect of activation of this circuitry is that resetting may require
pulling the plug or turning off the real (hard) power switch.

Is there anything else unusual about the picture lately that would indicate
an actual problem with the HV? For example, has it suddenly gotten brighter
than normal or has the size decreased? If this is the case, then there may be
some problem with the HV regulation. If not, the shutdown circuit may be
overly sensitive or one of its components may be defective - a bad connection
of leaky cap (or zener).

The HV shutdown circuit usually monitors a winding off of the flyback for
voltage exceeding some reference and then sets a flip flop shutting the
horizontal drive off.

On some Sony models, a HV resistive divider performs this function and these
do fail - quite often. The red block called a 'HV capacitor' is a common
cause of immediate or delayed shutdown on certain Sony monitors and TVs. See
the section: @{"Apple monitor dies after variable length of time" link "12.21"}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.3 "Low or no high voltage"

Most of these problems are due to faults in the horizontal deflection system
- shorted HOT, shorted windings or HV rectifiers in the flyback, defective
tripler, or other bad parts on the primary side of the flyback.

In addition, with multiscan monitors, the incorrect voltage or other
component could be selected due to a logic fault or a problem with the
selection relay or other circuitry.

However, if you discover an inch layer of filth inside the monitor, the HV
could simply be shorting out - clean it first.

In most cases, these sorts of faults will put an excessive load on the
horizontal output circuits so there may be excessive heating of the HOT or
other components. You may hear an audible arcing or sizzling sound from
internal shorts in the flyback or tripler. Either of these may bet hot,
crack, bulge, or exhibit visible damage if left on with the fault present.

Many modern monitors do not regulate HV directly but rather set it via
control of the low voltage power supply to the HOT (B+), by snubber
capacitors across the HOT, and the turns ratio of the flyback. The HV is
directly related to the B+ so if this is low, the HV will be low as well.
Faulty snubber capacitors will generally do the opposite - increase the HV
and the X-ray protection circuits may kick in. However, low HV is also a
possibility. The only way the turns ratio of the flyback can change is from a
short which will manifest its presence in other ways as well - excessive
heating and load on the horizontal output circuits.

While a shorted second anode connection to the CRT is theoretically possible,
this is quite unlikely (except, as noted, due to dirt).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.4 "Excessive high voltage"

Any significant increase in HV should cause the X-ray protection circuits to
kick in and either shut down the set or modify the deflection in such a way
as to render it harmless.

Symptoms include arcing/sparking of HV, smaller than normal picture, and
under certain scenarios, possible excessive brightness.

Causes of the HV being too high are:

  1. Excess B+ voltage to the HOT. The likely cause is to a low voltage
     regulator failure.

  2. Open snubber capacitors across the HOT. These are under a lot of stress
     and are located near hot components so failure is possible.

  3. Incorrect excessively long scan drive to HOT caused by failure of
     horizontal oscillator/sync circuits. However, other things like the HOT
     will probably blow up first. The picture will definitely be messed up.
     This is more likely with multiscan monitors than TVs since what is too
     long for one scan range may be correct for another and the selection
     circuitry is confused or broken.

  4. Failure of HV regulator. Actual HV regulators are uncommon today but the
     HV may controlled by a feedback voltage from a divider (focus or screen,
     or its own) or a secondary winding on the flyback setting the B+ or
     drive timing. This may result in an underscanned (smaller than normal)
     picture if only the HV and not the deflection voltages as well are
     derived from the same supply.

In one example of (4), a arcing of the HV in a Conrac studio monitor resulted
in the destruction of the HV switchmode invertor transistor (this used a
separate HV supply) and a fusable resistor. The cause was an open HV feedback
resistor divider allowing the HV to increase drastically.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.5 "Arcing, sparking, or corona from CRT HV anode (red wire/suction cup)"

Symptoms could include a sizzling corona or more likely, an occasional or
rapid series of sharp snaps - possibly quite loud and quite visible - from
the anode cap on the CRT to the grounded coating on the outside of the CRT or
a chassis ground point (or any other conductor nearby). Corona is a high
resistance leakage through the air without total breakdown. The snapping is
caused by the sudden and nearly complete discharge of the CRT anode
capacitance through a low resistance ionized path similar to lightening.

There are two likely causes:

  1. Dirt, dust, grime, around and under the suction cup on the CRT are
     providing a discharge path. This may be more severe in humid weather.
     Safely discharge the HV and then remove and thoroughly clean the HV
     suction cup and the area under it and on the CRT for several inches
     around the HV connection. Make sure there are no loose wires or other
     possible places for the HV to discharge to in the vicinity.

  2. The high voltage has gone through the roof. Usually, the X-ray
     protection circuitry should kick in but it can fail. If cleaning does
     not help, this is a likely possibility. See the sections:
     @{"High voltage shutdown due to X-ray protection circuits" link "10.2"} and
	 @{"Excessive high voltage" link "10.4"}

@endnode
@node 10.6 "Arcing at CRT sparkgaps"

This is rarely due to a defective sparkgap but rather is a safety mechanism
like a fuse designed to protect the internal electrodes of the CRT if the
focus or screen voltage should become excessive. The sparkgap breaks down
first and prevents internal arcing in the CRT.

An arcing sparkgap is usually accompanied by total loss of picture or bad
focus, brightness or focus fluctuations, or any of a number of similar
symptoms. The usual cause is a breakdown inside the focus divider inside the
flyback or tripler. Sometimes, it is in a component that can be disassembled
and cleaned but not generally. Replacement of the bad part will be needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.7 "Arcing from flyback or vicinity"

If the arc is coming from a specific point on the flyback - a crack or
pinhole - this may be patched using high voltage sealer or even a few layers
of plastic electrical tape. This may prove to be a permanent repair although
starting the search for a source for a new flyback would not hurt just in
case. The arc most likely did damage the insulation internally which may or
may not be a problem in the future.

In some cases, the pinhole or crack is an indication of a more serious
problem - overheating due to shorted windings in the flyback or excessive
secondary load.

First, clean the areas around the arc thoroughly and then try several layers
of plastic electrical tape. If the TV works normally for say, an hour, then
there is probably nothing else wrong and you can try for a proper sealing job
or hope that tape holds out (put a few more layers on - each is good for
about 8-10 KV theoretically).

If the arc is from one of the sparkgaps around the CRT, this could also be a
flyback problem indicating internal shorts in the focus/screen network.

Once I had a TV where the main problem was a cracked flyback arcing but this
took out one of the fusable resistors for the power supply to the *vertical*
output so the symptoms included a single horizontal line. Don't ask me to
explain - replacing that resistor and the flyback (the flyback tested good,
but this was for someone else) fixed the TV.

In another case, a VGA monitor, a pinhole developed in the flyback casing
probably due to poor plastic molding at the time of manufacture. This
resulted in a most spectacular case of sparking to a nearby bracket. A few
layers of electrical tape was all that was needed to affect a permanent
repair.

@node 10.8 "Ozone smell and/or smoke from monitor"

Smoking is just as bad for monitors as for people and usually more quickly
terminal (no pun....).

White acrid smoke may indicate a failed electrolytic capacitor in the power
supply probably in conjunction with a shorted rectifier. Needless to say,
pull the plug at once.

A visual inspection should be able to easily confirm the bad capacitor as it
will probably be bulging and have condensed residue nearby. Check the
rectifier diodes or bridge rectifier with an ohmmeter. Resistance across any
pair of leads should be more than a few ohms in at least one direction.
Remove from the circuit to confirm. Both the faulty diode(s) and capacitor
should be replaced (though the capacitor may work well enough to test with
new diode(s).

If a visual inspection fails to identify the smoking part, you can probably
plug the monitor in for a few seconds until the source of the smoke is
obvious but be prepared to pull the plug in a real hurry.

If the smell/smoke is coming from the flyback, then it has probably gone
belly up. You may be able to see a crack or bulge in the case. While the
flyback will definitely need to be replaced, it is likely that nothing else
is wrong. However, it might be prudent to use a Variac when performing
initial testing with the replacement just in case there is a secondary short
circuit or excess HV problem.

@node 10.9 "X-ray and other EM emission from my monitor?"

X-ray radiation is produced when a high velocity electron beam strikes a
target containing heavy metals. In a modern monitor, this can only take place
at the shadowmask/aperture grille and phosphor screen of the CRT.

For X-rays, the amount of radiation (if any) will be proportional to
brightness. The energy (determined by the CRT high voltage, called KVP in the
medical imaging field) is not affected. This is one reason many monitors and
TVs are designed with brightness limiting circuits.

In any case, there will be virtually no X-ray emissions from the front of the
CRT as the glass is greater than an inch thick and probably contains some
lead for added shielding. Also see the section:
@{"Should I be worried about X-ray exposure while servicing a TV or monitor?" link "10.10"}

Electromagnetic radiation (EM) is produced mostly from the deflection yoke
and to a lesser extent from some of the other magnetic components like
transformers and inductors. Depending on monitor design (some are
specifically designed to reduce this), EM emissions can vary quite a bit.
Frequencies range from the 50/60 Hz of the power line or vertical scan rate
to several hundred KHz in the AM broadcast band. The intensity and spectral
distribution will vary depending on horizontal and vertical scan rate.

A totally black screen will reduce X-ray emission to zero. It will not affect
EM emissions significantly as most of this comes from the magnetic parts,
particularly the deflection yoke.

There is no measurable microwave, IR, or UV radiation.

I refuse to get into the discussion of what, if any, health problems result
from low level EM emissions. There is simply not enough data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 10.10 "Should I be worried about X-ray exposure while servicing a TV or monitor?"

The only source of X-rays in a modern TV or monitor is from the CRT. X-rays
are generated when a high velocity electron bean strikes a heavy metal
target.  For anything you are likely to encounter, this can only happen in a
vacuum - thus inside the CRT. The higher the voltage, the greater the
velocity and potential danger.

The thick front CRT faceplate protects users adequately but there may be some
emission from the thinner sides. At 25-30 KV (quite low as X-ray energies go)
X-rays will be stopped by almost any metal so what you have to worry about is
where there are no shields.

However, realistically, there is very little and I would not worry about
exposure unless you plan to be sitting for hours on the sides, behind, or
under the TV or monitor - with a picture (there will be none if the screen is
black).

It is interesting that even those 1.5" Watchman and .5" camcorder viewfinder
CRTs have X-ray warning labels!

@node 10.11 "Flyback got wet"

You put your can of Coke where????

Who says these FAQs cannot be funny?

Needless to say, unplug the monitor immediately. Inspect around the target
area for obviously blown or damaged components. Test fuses and fusable
resistors. Remove all traces of liquid - especially sugary or corrosive
liquid. Use water first and then alcohol to promote drying. Repair burnt
solder connections and circuit board traces. Once the monitor is entirely
dried out, power it up - preferably through a series light bulb and/or Variac
until you are sure nothing else will let loose. Look, listen, and smell for
any unusual behavior. If it now works, then consider yourself lucky. If not,
there may be damage to transistors, ICs, or other components.

Another cause of this is using spray cleaner or a too wet rag on the front of
the CRT (other parts of the monitor, for that matter). Any liquid which drips
inside (all too likely) may short out circuitry on the mainboard with very
expensive consequences.

@node 10.12 "Blooming or breathing problems"

Blooming is defined as an expansion of the raster or horizontal sections of
the raster with bright material. For example, switching between dark and
light picture causes the size of the picture to expand by 10%. A slight
change in size is unavoidable but if it is greater than 1 or 2 percent from a
totally black image to a full white one, this is either an indication of a
defective monitor or one that is badly designed. The cause is poor low or
high voltage regulation. Check the B+ to the horizontal deflection. This is
usually well regulated. If it is varying in sympathy to the size changes,
trace back to determine why the low voltage regulator is not doing its job.
The reason for the size change is that the high voltage is dropping and
reducing the stiffness of the electron beam.

Expansion of the raster width in areas of bright imagery is an indication of
short term regulation problems. The video drive may be interacting with the
other power supplies. Check for ripple - this would be at the vertical scan
rate - in the various regulated power supplies. The cause may be a dried up
electrolytic capacitor - once you locate the offending voltage, test or
substitute capacitors in that supply.

In both these cases, if this just started after some work was done to the
monitor, the brightness limiter and/or video drive may simply be set so high
that the monitor cannot supply enough current to the high voltage. If the
brightness is acceptable with these turned down slightly and still have
acceptable brightness, then there may be nothing wrong.

Breathing is defined as a periodic change in the size of the raster which may
be independent of what is displayed or its severity or frequency may be
related to the brightness or darkness of the image. This is another type of
regulation problem and may be caused by bad electrolytic capacitors or other
components in the low voltage power supplies. If the monitor uses a
switchmode power supply or low voltage regulator separate from the horizontal
deflection, first check its output(s) for a variation in voltage at the
breathing rate. Test with a light bulb or resistor load to confirm that the
problem is here and not the deflection or remainder of the monitor.

@node 11.1 "Blank picture, power light on, digital controls (if any) active"

Does 'blank picture' means a totally black screen with the brightness and
contrast controls having no effect whatsoever? Or, is there is no picture but
there is a raster - light on the screen? The direction in which
troubleshooting should proceed differ significantly depending the answer.

Verify that you computer has not simply entered power saving mode and blanked
the screen or shut off the monitor video and power circuits entirely.

Confirm that the video source is not defective or blank - try another one.

Here are some questions:

  1. Is there any light on the screen at any settings of the brightness and
     contrast controls, and/or when switching channels. Can you see any
     raster scanning lines?

  2. Looking in the back of the monitor, can you see the glow of the CRT
     filament?

  3. Do you get that static on the front of the tube that would indicate that
     there is high voltage? Any cracking or other normal or abnormal sounds
     or smells?

If the answer to any of these is 'no', then you have a power supply and/or
deflection problem. Refer the the section: @{"No picture but indications of power" link "8.8"}
Possible causes of no raster: no/low HV, drive to CRT bad/shut off as
a result of fault elsewhere, blanking as a result of power saving or
controller malfunction, filament to CRT not getting powered.

Possible causes of no video: problem in video input, video amplifiers, video
output, cutoff due to other fault.

It could be as simple as a bad connection - try gently prodding the boards
with an insulated stick while watching the screen. Check for loose connectors
and reseat all internal connectors.

@node 11.2 "No color - black and white picture"

This means absolutely no color - equivalent to a black and white picture. Not
even a hint of color.

If you are using a composite video input, troubleshoot the chroma circuitry
like you would a TV - see the document: "Notes on the Diagnosis and Repair of
TeleVision (TV) Sets"

This is an extremely unlikely failure mode for a computer monitor unless you
are using a composite video input. It is most likely to a software driver or
program problem. Sometimes, the PC will think that the monitor you have
connected is not capable of color and certain programs will then display in
B/W no matter what.

In some cases this is due to an initialization problem - possibly a race
condition during the boot process - especially likely if you are using an
older video card with a new fast processor.

First, confirm that the source is actually in color - try the monitor on
another computer or vice-versa.

Check the settings of any mode switches - in rare cases there is a color/mono
switch or button.

Note that to the average person, the obvious question becomes: is my color
picture tube bad? The answer is a definitive NO. It is virtually impossible
for a defective CRT to cause a total loss of color. A defective CRT can cause
a lack of a primary color - R, G, or, B which will mess up the color but is
not likely to result in a black and white picture.

@endnode
@node 11.4 "Monitor manufacturing quality and cold solder joints"

Any intermittent problems with monitors that cause random sudden changes in
the picture brightness, color, size, or position are often a result of bad
connections.

Bad solder joints are very common in monitors due both to poor quality
manufacturing as well as to deterioration of the solder bond after numerous
thermal cycles and components running at high temperature. Without knowing
anything about the circuitry, it is usually possible to cure these problems
by locating all bad solder connections and cleaning and reseating internal
connectors. The term 'cold solder joint' strictly refers to a solder
connection that was either not heated enough during manufacturing, was cooled
too quickly, or where part pins were moved before the solder had a chance to
solidify. A similar situation can develop over time with thermal cycling
where parts are not properly fastened and are essentially being held in by
the solder alone. Both situations are most common with the pins of large
components like transformers, power transistors and power resistors, and
large connectors. The pins of the components have a large thermal mass and
may not get hot enough during manufacturing. Also, they are relatively
massive and may flex the connection due to vibration or thermal expansion and
contraction.

These problems are particularly common with TVs and monitors - especially
cheaper monitors.

To locate cold solder joints, use a strong light and magnifier and examine
the pins of large components for hairline cracks in the solder around the
pin.  Gently wiggle the component if possible (with the power off). Any
detectable movement at the joint indicates a problem. With the power on,
gently prod the circuit board and suspect components with an insulated tool
to see if the problem can be effected.

When in doubt, resolder any suspicious connections. Some monitors may use
double sided circuit boards which do not have plated through holes. In these
cases, solder both top and bottom to be sure that the connections are solid.
Use a large enough soldering iron to assure that your solder connection is
solid. Put a bit of new solder with flux on every connection you touch up
even if there was plenty of solder there before. However, remove any obvious
excess. Inspect for solder bridges, sliver, splashes, etc. before applying
power.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.5 "Intermittent, flickering, or Missing Colors"

This is a catch-all for some of the most common monitor problems. Most of the
causes boil down to bad connections of one form or another. However,
defective components like bias resistors on the CRT driver board or in the
video circuitry could also be at fault.

Does whacking the monitor have any effect? If so, then bad connections are
confirmed. If the color(s) come and go suddenly, then it is most likely not a
CRT problem. If colors fade in and out over a 10-15 second period, take a
look at the neck of the CRT for the glowing filaments of the electron guns.
If one is not lit or is coming and going independent of the others, then you
may have a bad filament connection inside the CRT. The CRT will need to be
replaced (or more likely, the monitor will go to the dumpster).

Possible causes of intermittent or missing colors:

  1. VGA or other video input cable. Sometimes these develop intermittent
     problems at the connector to the VGA board. These may be internal to the
     cable in which case it will need to be replaced or if you are handy and
     have infinite patience, you can replace just the VGA connector.

     Alternatively, the male pins of the cable may not be making good contact
     with the female VGA socket. First try contact cleaner. If this does not
     work, gently squishing the male pins with a pair of needlenose pliers
     may provide temporary or permanent relief if the pins are a tad too
     small. However, if you go too far, you can damage or break the pins or
     cause the female sockets to become enlarged and loose fitting for any
     other monitor you may use.

     There may be cold solder joints on the VGA board itself at the VGA
     connector. These can be resoldered.

  2. Printed circuit board on the CRT neck. This is a common location for
     cold solder joints. Check with a bright light and magnifying glass for
     hairline cracks around the pins of larger parts. Prod and tap with an
     insulated tool to see if the problem is effected. Resolder if necessary.

  3. Cold solder joints elsewhere in monitor usually around the pins of large
     parts such as transformers, power transistors and resistors, and
     internal connectors. Inspect with a strong light and magnifier if
     necessary.

  4. Internal connectors that need to be cleaned and reseated. Remove, clean
     with contact cleaner, burnish, and replace.

  5. Bad filament connections inside the CRT (gradual fade in and out or one
     filament not lit). Replace CRT or monitor.

@endnode
@node 11.6 "Ghosts, shadows, or streaks in picture adjacent to vertical edges"

Complaints about these kinds of problems are very common especially as the
screen resolution and necessary video bandwidth keeps increasing. Most are
due to cable and video termination deficiencies and not actual monitor
defects.

The video signals for red, green, and blue (or just a single signal for
monochrome) are sent over cables which are generally 75 ohm transmission
lines. These are coaxial cables that may be combined inside a single sheath
for VGA, SVGA, MACs, and many workstations but may be separate coaxes with
BNC (or other) connectors for other video applications.

Without going into transmission line theory, suffice it to say that to obtain
good quality video, the following conditions must be met:

  1. A good quality of cable must be used. This means one in which the
     characteristic impedance is close to the optimum 75 ohms, one which has
     low losses, and one which has good shielding. For installations using
     BNC connectors, a good quality of 100% shielded RG59U is often used. The
     BNC connectors must be properly installed or they will contribute to
     mismatch problems.

  2. Where multiple monitors are to be connected to a single video source,
     all wiring is done in a daisy chain fashion. The only taps permitted are
     the minimum necessary to connect each monitor to the chain. This usually
     means a BNC-T connector or a pair of connectors on the monitor for each
     video signal. T connections with cable must be avoided.

  3. Only the last monitor in the chain should be terminated in 75 ohms. All
     of the others must be set to Hi-Z. Monitors with BNC connectors will
     usually have one switch or a switch for each color to select
     termination.

Monitors for PCs, MACs, and workstations usually have built in termination
and do not offer the choice of Hi-Z. This means that without a video
distribution amplifier, it is not possible to connect multiple monitors of
this type to a single video source with any expectation of a good quality
display.

Failure to follow these rules will result in video ringing, ghosts, shadows,
and other unsightly blemishes in the picture. It is often not possible to
control all aspects of the video setup. The cable is often a part of the
monitor and cannot easily be substituted for a better one. The monitor may
not have properly designed circuitry such that it degrades the video
regardless of the cable and display board quality. The display card itself
may not have proper drivers or source termination.

Ironically, the better the video card, the more likely that there will be
visible problems due to termination. This is due to the very high bandwidth
and associated signal edge rates.

Some examples of common termination problems:

   o Overly bright picture with trails following vertical edges, perhaps with
     periodic ringing. This is due to a missing termination. Check if the
     monitor is set for Hi-Z instead of 75 ohms. If there is no switch, then
     the termination may be faulty or the monitor may need an external
     resistor. For BNC connectors, plug-on terminations are available.

   o Bright ghost images adjacent to vertical lines. This may indicate that
     the terminating resistor is greater than the impedance of the cable. You
     may be using Ethernet Thinnet cable by accident which is RG58 with an
     impedance of 50 ohms.

   o Dark picture and ghost images adjacent to vertical lines. This may
     indicate that the terminating resistor is too low - multiple monitors on
     a chain all set for 75 ohms instead of just the last one. Or, an
     improper type of cable such as audio patch cord.

   o Fuzzy vertical edges. This may indicate a poor quality cable or a run
     which is just too long. For high resolutions such as 1280x1024, the
     maximum cable length may be as short as 25 feet or less for poor quality
     cable. Better cable or fiber-optic repeaters may be necessary.

   o Other similar problems - check cables for defective or improperly
     installed connectors. This is especially applicable to cables with BNC
     or UHF type connectors which require a kind of artistic talent to
     assembly properly and consistently.

If only 1 or 2 colors (of the R, G, and B) are effected, then look for
improper switch settings or bad connections (bad cable connectors are really
common) on the problem color cables.

@node 11.7 "General streaks or lines to the right of bright or dark areas"

The problem is that on a white background the various objects leave a shadow
to their right. Not a duplicate image but more like horizontal dark streaks
on the white background. Also it seems that high intensity colors display
very bright but low intensity colors are overly dark (almost black). The
contrast and brightness adjustments make no difference.

This could be a number of things but they are all in the video amplifier and
probably not the CRT driver board.

Since all colors are effected, look for something common like a bad power
supply. With a scope, this would probably be rather easy even without
schematics. The fact that the brightness and contrast controls do nothing
would suggest some fault in their general area or the IC or transistors they
control in the video amps - and that this is not a CRT problem. Locate the
video amp IC if it uses one and locate a pinout - this should be enough to
determine which signals are faulty.

First, do check carefully for bad connections and other obvious failures.

This could also be a symptom of a bad CRT but this would be unusual with a
not-ancient monitor.

@endnode
@node 11.8 "Washed out picture"

If you can obtain a full intensity raster by varying the brightness or screen
control, then your problem is most likely in the video amplifiers or power
for the video amplifiers.

If, however, the screen control varies the brightness but will not get a
bright raster, you probably have problems either with the HV power supply or
the filament supply for the CRT - is there the normal bright orange glow at
the base of the CRT? If it is dim or very reddish, there may be a marginal
connection or bad component in the filament circuitry.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.9 "Red, green, or blue full on - fog over picture"

This could be a heater-cathode (H-K) short in the CRT or a failure of a
component in the chroma circuits or video output (driver board).

Don't panic - heater-cathode shorts in CRTs can often be worked around.

Some simple tests can confirm or rule out other possibilities.

Compare the voltages for the video drive signals to the CRT on the little
board on the neck of the CRT with the CRT both connected and unplugged. A
schematic will help greatly in locating these signals.

If there is a significant difference especially on the bad color, then the
CRT is a likely candidate. Try tapping the neck of the CRT GENTLY (with it
plugged in and while viewing a picture) to see if it is an intermittent
problem.

If there is no significant difference, you may have a bad driver or a problem
in the chroma circuits.

Look for bad connection/cold solder joints, probably on the little board on
the neck of the CRT. Use an insulated stick to gently prod the board and its
components in an effort to induce/cure the problem. Look carefully for
hairline cracks around the component leads.

You can swap components between two colors and/or test with an ohmmeter on
that driver board to determine what is bad. The nice thing about color
monitors and TVs is that there three copies of each of these components.
Swapping and/or comparisons between these is an excellent diagnostic
technique.

Alternatively, interchange the outputs of the bad color with a good one by
jumpering on the video driver board (on the CRT neck). If the bad color
changes, then the problem is in the circuitry and not the CRT.

@endnode
@node 11.10 "Providing isolation for a CRT H-K short"

This procedure will substitute a winding of your own for the one that is
built in to the flyback to isolate the shorted filament from the ground or
voltage reference. Note that if you have a schematic and can determine where
to disconnect the ground or voltage reference connection to the filament
winding, try this instead.

The flyback is the thing with the fat red wire coming out of it (and perhaps
a couple of others going to the CRT board or it is near this component if
your monitor has a separate tripler) and may have a couple of controls for
focus and screen. It should have some exposed parts with a ferrite core about
1/2-3/4" diameter. The filament of the CRT is the internal heater for each
gun - it is what glows orange when the set is on. What has happened is that a
part of the fine wire of the bad color's filament (assuming this is indeed
your problem) has shorted to the cathode - the part that actually emits the
electrons. Normally, the heater circuit is grounded or tied to a reference
voltage so when it shorts to the cathode, the cathode voltage level is pulled
to ground or this reference.

You will need some well insulated wire, fairly thick (say #18-22). Find a
spot on the flyback where you can stick this around the core. Wrap two turns
around the core and solder to the CRT filament pins after cutting the
connections to the original filament source (scribe the traces on the board
to break them). This winding should cause the filaments to glow about the
same brightness as before but now isolated from ground. If they are too dim,
put another turn on the flyback to boost the voltage. (Don't go overboard as
you may blow the filament totally if you put too many turns on the core - you
then toss the TV.) Route the wires so that there is no chance of them getting
near the high voltage or any sharp metal edges etc. Your picture quality may
be a tad lower than it was before because of the added stray capacitance of
the filament wiring being attached to the the (formerly bad) video signal,
but hey, something is better than nothing.

@endnode
@node 11.11 "Rescuing a shorted CRT"

If the short is filament-cathode (H-K), you don't want to use the following
approach since you may blow out the filament in the process. If this is the
case, you may be able to float the filament and live with the short (see the
section on: @{"Red, green, or blue full on - fog over picture" link "11.9"}

Shorts in the CRT that are between directly accessible electrodes can be
dealt with in a more direct way than for H-K shorts. At this point you have
nothing to loose. A shorted CRT is not terribly useful.

If the short is between two directly accessible electrodes like cathode-grid,
then as a last resort, you might try zapping it with a charged capacitor.

Unplug the CRT socket!

Start with a relatively small capacitor - say a few uF at a couple hundred
volts. Check to see if the short is blown after each zap - few may be needed.
Increase the capacitance if you fell lucky but have had little success with
the small capacitor.

If the fault is intermittent, you will, of course, need to catch the CRT with
the socket disconnected and the short still present. Try some gentle tapping
if necessary. If you do this with the charged capacitor across the suspect
electrode, you WILL know when the short occurs!

@node 11.12 "Brightening an old CRT"

If performing adjustments of the internal background and/or screen controls
still results in a dark picture even after a long warmup period, the CRT may
simply be near the end of its useful life. In the old days of TVs with short
lived CRTs, the CRT brightener was a common item (sold in every corner
drugstore, it seemed!).

First confirm that the filaments are running at the correct voltage - there
could be a marginal connection or bad resistor in the filament circuit. It
may not be possible to measure the voltage with a DMM but a service manual
will probably have a waveform or other test. A visual examination is not a
bad way to determine if the filaments are hot enough. They should be a fairly
bright orange to yellow color. A dim red or almost dark filament is probably
not getting its quota of electrons. It is not be the CRT since all three
filaments are wired in parallel and for all three to be defective is very
unlikely.

You can try a making a brightener. Caution: this may shorten the life of the
CRT - possibly quite dramatically (like it will blow in a couple of seconds
or minutes). However, if the monitor or TV is otherwise destined for the
scrap heap, it is worth a try.

The approach is simple: you are going to increase the voltage to the
filaments of the electron guns making them run hotter. Hopefully, just hotter
enough to increase the brightness without blowing them out.

Voltage for the CRT filament is usually obtained from a couple of turns on
the flyback transformer. Adding an extra turn will increase the voltage and
thus the current making the filaments run hotter. This will also shorten the
CRT life - perhaps rather drastically. However, if the monitor was headed for
the dumpster anyhow, you have nothing to lose. You can just add a turn to an
existing winding or make your own separate filament winding as outlined in
the section: @{"Providing isolation for a CRT H-K short" link "11.10"}

In some monitors, there is a separate filament supply on the mainboard - this
should be obvious once you trace the filament wires from the video driver
board). In this case, it still may be possible to increase this output or
substitute another supply but a schematic will be required.

There are also commercial CRT rejuvenators that supposedly zap the cathodes
of the electron guns. A TV or monitor service center may be able to provide
this service, though it is, at best, a short term fix.

Setting the brightness excessively high may result in enough heating of the
shadowmask to distort it. IF severe enough, the positions of the holes will
shift enough to result in visible purity problems. This is less of a problem
with tubes using an InVar shadow/slot mask. It should also be less of a
problem for Trinitron aperture grille CRTs.

The only solution is to reduce the brightness.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.16 "Why is the brightness so non-uniform in bright areas?"

Actually, the intensity variation is likely to be even worse than it appears
- possibly as more than 2:1 from center to edges. In most cases you do not
notice it. With large deflection angle tubes, fewer electrons make it to
phosphor dots near the edge of the screen. It is simple geometry.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.17 "Brightness changes from left-to-right across screen"

This usually indicates a fault in the power supplies to the video amplifier
and/or video output circuits. Most likely, an electrolytic capacitor has
dried up and is not adequately filtering the power derived from the flyback
which then has ripple at the horizontal scan rate and thus locked to the
screen. The voltage decays from left-to-right between horizontal flyback
pulses.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.18 "Picture fades in and out"

If the picture faded away on the order of 10-20 seconds (and if it comes
back, also comes up to full brightness in same time frame - possibly with the
persuasion of some careful whacking) AND with NO other significant changes
such as size, focus, etc., then take a look in the back of the tube for the
filament to be lit - the orange glow near the CRT socket. If there is none,
then you probably have a bad solder connection on the circuit board on the
neck of the CRT. Look for fine cracks around pins on that board. Try prodding
it with an insulating stick to see if the picture comes back. Resolder if
necessary. It is probably not a bad CRT as the filaments are usually wired in
parallel and all would not go bad at the same time.

However, if only a single color fades in and out, then a bad connection
inside the CRT is a distinct possibility - look for only one of the
filament's glow to be coming and going. This is probably not worth fixing
since it will require CRT replacement.

If the picture faded away with other symptoms, then there is probably a fault
in the video amplifier/output one of its power supplies - still probably a
loose connection if you are able to get it back by whacking.

@endnode
@node 11.19 "Occasional brightness flashes"

These may last only a fraction of a scan line or much much longer.

Make sure it is not the video source - try another one.

This could mean an intermittent fault in a variety of places including the
video circuitry and SCREEN power supply:

   o Brightness circuitry - SCREEN, master background or its power supply.
     Could be in or around flyback or focus/screen divider. Could perhaps be
     in the CRT, but probably less likely.

   o Video amp before or at chroma demodulator (if composite input) - since
     after this point, you would most likely get colored flashes since only
     one of the RGB signals would likely be effected. However, a bad power
     connection to the video circuitry could cause all the colors to be
     affected.

If you still get flashes, it should be quite easy to monitor either the video
outputs or SCREEN supply (with a HV divider on your scope) for noise. Then
trace back to power or noise source.

@endnode
@node 11.20 "Occasional static, lines, spots, or other unsightly blemishes"

First, confirm that these are not video source - PC - related. Try the
monitor on another computer. This may be a problem with the hardware or
driver (software) for the video card, the O/S, or memory or bus speed.

If it is not computer related, then it could be arcing, corona, bad
connections, or some electronic component breaking down. See the appropriate
sections for these problems.

Note that problems in absolutely fixed locations or with an extent related to
pixel sizes in the video card are nearly always computer/video card related
and not due to a faulty monitor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.21 "Flickering monitor"

First, make sure your scan rate is set high enough (but not beyond the
capabilities of the monitor). A scan rate less than 60 Hz is likely to result
in annoying flicker especially at high brightness levels.

See if the flickering correlates with any processor or disk activity
indicating a software driver or video card problem.

Assuming neither of these applies and you are not doing your work by
candlelight, a flickering image is probably due to an intermittent arc or
short, probably in the high voltage section near or at the flyback
transformer. However, it is also possible that it is due to a simple bad
connection elsewhere.

So the first thing to do will be to remove the cover and without touching
anything, carefully examine for any obvious signs of bad connections, arcing,
or burned areas. In particular look for:

   o hairline cracks around the pins of large components like power
     transistors, power resistors, transformers, and connectors.

   o any discoloration, cracking, other unusual signs on the flyback. The
     flyback also provides, via a high resistance divider network, the
     several KV for focus and several hundred V for the G2 (screen) CRT
     electrode. These are the voltages that may be intermittently changing
     and resulting in flicker.

Now, with the monitor powered in a darkened room with a normal picture (use
the highest resolution at which your monitor will work as this should put the
most stress on it, maybe).

   o Look for any arcing or corona around the area of the flyback or the neck
     of the CRT first, then just anywhere.

   o Use a well insulated stick (wood or plastic) to gently prod the circuits
     board, components, wires, etc. to see if you can induce the problem.

There will probably be a pair of adjustments on the flyback itself. One of
these is FOCUS and the other is SCREEN - essentially a master brightness.

   o Now, with one hand in your back pocket, try turning each of these a
     fraction of a turn in each direction. Don't worry, you cannot hurt
     anything by doing this. The FOCUS should only change the sharpness of
     the picture. The SCREEN should only change the brightness. In both
     cases, this should be a smooth effect. Sometimes, these controls will
     simply get dirty and cause the problems you have seen. In this case,
     just moving them back and forth may clean them. If one affects the other
     - if turning focus alters brightness or vice-versa, there is a short
     between the focus and screen voltages, probably inside the flyback but
     it could be elsewhere.

It is likely that all of the above tests will come out negative as you may
have an intermittent short internal to the flyback which can only be fixed by
replacement. However, eliminate the easy fixes first.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.22 "Excessive brightness and/or washed out picture"

Excessive brightness/washed out picture is often an indication of a problem
with the SCREEN supply to the CRT. May be a bad capacitor or resistor divider
often in the flyback transformer assembly or on the board on the neck of the
CRT.

If the excessive brightness just developed over time, then a simple
adjustment of the SCREEN or background brightness controls may keep it (and
you) happy for a long time.

When good, a typical value would be in the 200-600 VDC at the CRT. The SCREEN
(may be called master brightness or background) control should vary this.

It could also be a problem with biasing of the video output transistors or
their power source.

There may individual controls for background brightness on the little board
on the neck of the CRT.

However, we are looking for a common problem since all colors are wrong in
the same way.

First, check for bad connections/cold solder joints by gently prodding with
an insulating stick. Check voltages and bias levels.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.23 "Focus problems"

Slight deterioration in focus can be corrected by adjusting the focus control
usually located on the flyback transformer. Sometimes, this is accessible
externally but usually not. On monochrome monitors, the focus control, if
any, may be located on the main board.

Don't expect to have perfect focus everywhere on the screen. Usually there
will be some degradation in the corners. A compromise can generally be struck
between perfect focus in the center and acceptable focus in the corners.

If the adjustments have no effect, then there is probably a fault in the
focus power supply.

For most color TVs and monitors, the correct focus voltage will be in the 4-8
KDC range so you will need a meter that can go that high or some big
resistors to extend its range or a HV probe. You must use a high impedance
meter as the current availability from the focus power supply is very low.

The pots in the flyback are sometimes accessible by removing their cover,
which may snap on. However, a typical focus circuit will have a large value
resistor potted inside the flyback (like 200 Megohms).

Try to measure the focus in-circuit. If the value you read is very low
(assuming your meter has a high enough impedance not to load the circuit
appreciably), then disconnect the wire (from the PCB on the neck of the CRT
or wherever) and measure again and observe any change in picture.

If still low, then almost certainly there is a problem with the pot or the
flyback. See if you can open it enough to measure and/or disconnect the pot.
If the problem is inside the potted part of the flyback, the only alternative
is a new flyback or an external divider if you are so inclined. However, once
the focus network goes bad inside the flyback, there is an increased chance
other parts will fail at some point in the future.

If the voltages check out with the CRT disconnected, there is a chance of a
bad CRT or of a shorted component on the PCB on the neck of the CRT. Look for
shorted capacitors or burnt or damaged traces.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.24 "Bad focus (fuzzy picture)"

Focus voltage on the CRT is usually in the range of 2-8 KV DC and should be
controllable over a fairly wide range by the focus pot.

The focus pot is usually located on the flyback transformer or on an
auxiliary PCB nearby. The focus wire usually comes from the flyback or if the
general area or from a terminal on a voltage multiplier module in some cases.
It is usually a wire by itself going to the little board on the neck of the
CRT.

If a spark gap (a little 2 terminal device with a 1/8" gap in the middle) is
arcing with power on, then the resistive divider has shorted inside the
flyback, focus board, or HV multiplier - whatever you TV has - and the this
unit will need to be replaced. Ditto if the SCREEN control affects focus
and/or vice-versa.

Using a suitable voltmeter (range at least 10KVDC), you should be able to
measure it connected and disconnected. The ground return will be the outside
coating of the CRT which may or may not be the same as the metal chassis
parts. If the voltage is very low (less than 2K) and the pot has little
effect:

When measured right off of the source disconnected from the CRT circuit, then
the problem is probably in the focus network in the flyback (or wherever it
originates). Sometimes these can be disassembled and cleaned or repaired but
usually requires replacement of the entire flyback or voltage multiplier.

When measured with the CRT connected but reasonable with it disconnected,
then check for a bad capacitor on the little circuit board. The CRT could
also cause this but it is unlikely.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.25 "Focus drift with warmup or age"

Focus is controlled by a voltage of 2-8 KV DC usually derived from the
flyback transformer and includes some resistors and capacitors. One of these
could be changing value as it warms up. (assuming nothing else changes
significantly as the unit warms up. E.g., the brightness does not decrease.)

Focus is usually a separate wire running from the flyback or its neighborhood
to the PCB on the neck of the CRT. Look for components in this general area.
Use cold spray or a heat gun to isolate the one that is drifting. If you have
access to a high voltage meter, you should be able to see the voltage change
as the TV or monitor warms up - and when you cool the faulty part. If it is
in the flyback, then sometimes the part with the adjustments clips off and
can be repaired or cleaned. Most often, you will need to replace the flyback
as a unit.

Focus voltage is derived from a subset of the high voltage winding on the
flyback using a resistive voltage divider which includes the focus pot. These
are extremely high value resistors - 200 M ohm is common - and so leakage of
any kind can reduce or increase the focus voltage. All other things being ok
- i.e., the picture is otherwise fine - I would suspect this type of failure
rather than the CRT.

If you have a high voltage meter, you can measure the focus voltage to
determine if it is being changed by the focus pot and if it is in the
ballpark (2-8 KV typical). Sometimes, the part of the flyback with the focus
pot can be snapped off and cleaned or parts replaced but usually you need to
replace the whole unit. There may a capacitor or two on the PCB on the neck
of the CRT that could have increased leakage as well thus reducing the focus
voltage.

@endnode
@node 11.26 "Bad focus and adjustment changes brightness"

This is the classic symptom of a short between the focus and screen supplies
- probably in focus/screen divider which is part of the flyback or tripler.
If you have a high voltage meter, measuring the focus voltage will show that
(1) it is low and (2) it is affected by the SCREEN control Similarly, the
SCREEN voltage will be affected by the FOCUS control (which is what is
changing the brightness.

There is a slight possibility that this may be in the CRT as well. Measure
the FOCUS and SCREEN voltage with a high voltage meter. If they are identical
pull the plug on the CRT. If they are now their normal values, then a shorted
CRT is a distinct possibility - see the section: @{"Rescuing a shorted CRT" link "11.11"}

@node 11.27 "Purple blob - or worse"

Have you tried demagnetizing it? Try powering it off for a half hour, then
on.  Repeat a couple of times. This should activate the internal degausser.
See the section: @{"Degaussing (demagnetizing) the CRT" link "4.5"}

Is there any chance that someone waved a magnet hear the tube? Remove it
and/or move any items like monster speakers away from the set.

Was your kid experimenting with nuclear explosives - an EMP would magnetize
the CRT. Nearby lightening strikes may have a similar effect.

If demagnetizing does not help, then it is possible that something shifted on
the CRT - there are a variety of little magnets that are stuck on at the time
of manufacture to adjust purity. There are also service adjustments but it is
unlikely (though not impossible) that these would have shifted suddenly. This
may be a task for a service shop but you can try your hand at it if you get
the SAMs Photofact or service manual - don't attempt purity adjustments
without one.

If the monitor was dropped, then it is even possible that the internal
shadowmask of the CRT has become distorted and you now have a seventy-five
pound boat anchor.

It is even possible that this is a 'feature' complements of the manufacturer.
If certain components like transformers are of inferior design and/or are
located too close to the CRT, they could have an effect on purity. Even if
you did not notice the problem when the monitor was new, it might always have
been marginal and now a discoloration is visible due to slight changes or
movement of components over time.

@node 11.28 "Color monitor only displays one color"

I assume that now you have no other colors at all - no picture and no raster.
Let us say it is red - R.

It is probably not the CRT. Do you have a scope? Check for the R, G, and B
video signals at the CRT. You will probably find no signals for the defective
colors.

This is almost certainly a chroma circuit problem as any failure of the CRT
or a video driver would cause it to lose a single color - the other two would
be ok. Therefore, it is probably NOT the CRT or a driver on the little board
on the neck of the CRT.

Try turning up the SCREEN control to see if you can get a G and B raster just
to confirm that the CRT is ok.

Locate the video drive from the mainboard for the good and a bad color.
Interchange them and see if the problem moves. If so, then there is a video
signal problem. If not, it is on the little CRT board.

It could be a defective chroma IC or something else in the chroma decoder.

@node 11.29 "Disappearing Red (or other color)"

Problem: I have been given an old colour TV. The reception is good, but very
often, when the contrast and brightness of the TV image is low (e.g. when a
night scene is shown), the red colour slowly disappears, leaving behind the
green and blue image and many red lines.

The remaining red retrace are the giveaway that this is most likely not a CRT
problem.

(If there were no red lines, it could be the filament for the red gun of the
CRT going on and off due to a bad connection inside the CRT - bad news.)

How is a black and white picture? (Turn down the color control).

If B/W picture is good, then the problem is somewhere back in the chroma
decoder circuitry.

Check the video input to the CRT video driver board and signals on that
board. If B/W picture is also bad, then you can compare red and green signals
to determine where they are becoming different. The red lines in your
description sounds like the red video output circuit is drifting and messing
up the background level, blanking, screen, or other setting. Could be a
capacitor or other component.

@node 11.30 "Interference from Electrical Wiring"

If the wiring of normal outlets is done correctly even without a safety
ground, the currents should be balanced and you will not experience a
problem. However, many circuits, particularly those involving setups like
3-way switches or switched outlets and wiring in older buildings can have
unbalanced currents when active. If your monitors are close enough to the
wiring, there can be interference which will take the form of a flickering or
pulsating display.

Other than recommending moving the monitors, there is no easy solution. They
can be shielded with Mu Metal but that is expensive. Or you could run all
displays at a 60 Hz vertical rate (or 50 Hz depending on where you live).
However, this is inconvenient and will never be quite perfect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endnode
@node 11.31 "Interference from other Equipment"

Any type of equipment which uses or generates strong magnetic fields can
interfere with a monitor. Other computer monitors or TVs, equipment with
power transformers, and electric motors will cause a pulsating or flickering
display. Loudspeakers or other equipment with static magnetic fields will
cause color purity and/or geometric distortion problems which degauss will
not cure.

The easiest way to confirm that interference is your problem is to move the
monitor or suspect equipment to a different location. The only real solution
is to separate the monitor and interfering device.

Note that with scan rates that are not even near the power line frequency any
more, a variety of symptoms are possible including shimmering, wiggling,
undulating (how many more adjectives can you come up with?). The rate of the
movement will be related to the difference between the monitor scan rate and
the frequency of interference.

Problems are that all graphics applications fade to black, lose their color

You tried changing video drivers, modes, cleaning connections on cables and
video card, even pulled the card and cleaned the edge connector.

After cleaning up, things seemed to work (still had pincushion problem), but
next time it was powered on, same weird problems.

Voodoo might be required but more down-to-earth causes are likely:

Are you sure nothing changed in the building (like you installed a medical
MRI unit with a 2T magnet in the same room)?

All monitors have a built in degauss circuit which operates when power is
turned on after being off for at least 15 minutes or so. This could have
failed - it is switching off suddenly instead of ramping down as it should -
and is making the problem worse or you could have a power supply failure
inside the monitor.

Gradual variations in color or brightness on the screen or over time are
almost always monitor problems, not video card, software, or cables.

It won't hurt to try manual degauss with the monitor powered, see below. If
this clears it up - possibly until you turn the power off and on again, then
it may be the internal degauss circuitry.

@endnode
@node 11.33 "Jittering or flickering due to problems with AC power"

If you have eliminated other possibilities such as electromagnetic
interference from nearby equipment or electric wiring or a faulty video card
or cable - or software - then noisy or fluctuating AC power may be a
possibility. However, modern monitors usually have well regulated power
supplies so this is less common than it used to be. Then again, your monitor
may just be overly sensitive. It is also possible that some fault in its
power supply regulator has resulted in it becoming more sensitive to minor
power line fluctuations that are unavoidable.

One way to determine if the problem is likely to be related to AC power is to
run the monitor on clean power in the same location on the same computer. For
example, running it on an Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) with the line
cord pulled from the wall socket would be an excellent test. The output of
the UPS's invertor should be free of any power line noise. If the monitor's
image has now settled down:

  1. Large appliances like air conditioners, refrigerator, or washing
     machines on the same circuit might cause significant power dips and
     spikes as they cycle.

     Plugging a table lamp into the same outlet may permit you to see any
     obvious fluctuations in power. What else is on the same circuit?
     Depending on how your house or apartment is wired, the same feed from
     the service panel may be supplying power to widely separated areas.

  2. For some unfathomable reason, your monitor may just be more sensitive to
     something about the power from the circuit in that room. There may be
     nothing actually wrong, just different. While unlikely, a light dimmer
     on the same circuit could be producing line-conducted interference.

     If you have a multimeter, you could at least compare the voltages
     between the location where it has problems and the one where it is
     happy. Perhaps, the monitor is sensitive to being on a slightly
     different voltage. This might only be a problem if some circuitry in the
     monitor is marginal in some respect to begin with, however.

  3. There could be a bad connection somewhere on the circuit. If your house
     has Aluminum wiring, this is a definite possibility.

     Try a table lamp since its brightness should fluctuate as well. This
     should be checked out by a competent electrician as it represents a real
     fire hazard.

An electrician may be able to pinpoint the cause but many do not have the
training or experience to deal with problems of this sort. Certainly, if you
find any power line fluctuations not accounted for by major appliances, on
the same circuit this should be checked by an electrician.

@node 11.34 "My monitor has the shakes"

You turn on your monitor and 5-10 seconds later, the display is shaking or
vibrating for a second or so. It used to only occur when first turned on, but
now, the problem occurs 3 times in 30 seconds. Of course, many variations on
this general theme are possible.

Some possibilities:

  1. Defective degauss circuit - this would normally cause a shaking or
     vibration when you first turn it on but you normally do not notice it
     since the CRT is not warmed up. The degauss circuit may have developed a
     mind of its own.

  2. Other defective circuitry in monitor - power supply regulation,
     deflection, or bad internal connections.

  3. External interference - did you change anything or move your setup
     recently? See the sections on: @{"Interference from other equipment" link "11.31"} and

@node 11.35 "Loss of color after warmup"

If there is a general loss of picture but there is light on the screen if the

If it recovers after being off for a while, then you need to try a cold spray
in the video/controller to identify the component that is failing. Take
appropriate safety precautions while working in there!

If it stays broken, then most likely some component in the video circuitry,

@node 12.1 "Contour lines on high resolution monitors - Moire"

These fall into the category of wavey lines, contour lines, or light and dark
bands even in areas of constant brightness. These may be almost as fine as
the dot pitch on the CRT or 1 or 2 cm or larger and changing across the
screen. If they are more or less fixed on the screen and stable, then they
are not likely to be outside interference. (However, if they are locked to
the image, then there could be a problem with the video board.)

One cause of these lines is Moire (interference patterns) between the raster
and the dot structure of the CRT. Ironically, the better the focus on the
tube, the worse this is likely to be. Trinitrons, which do not have a
vertical dot structure should be immune to interference of this sort from the
raster lines (but not from the horizontal pixel structure).

You can test for Moire by slowly adjusting the vertical size. If it is Moire,
you should see the pattern change in location and spatial frequency as slight
changes are made to size. Changes to vertical position will move the patterns
without altering their structure - but they will not remain locked to the
moving image.

If they are due to the raster line structure - your focus is too good - the
patterns will remain essentially fixed in position on the face of the CRT for
horizontal size and position adjustments - the patterns will remain fixed
under the changing image.

How to eliminate it? If Moire is your problem, then there may be no easy
answer. For a given resolution and size, it will either be a problem or not.
You can try changing size and resolution - Moire is a function of geometry.
Ironically, I have a monitor which is nicer in this respect at 1024x768
interlaced than at 800x600 non-interlaced.

Some monitors have a 'Moire reduction mode' switch. This may or may not be of
help. One way to do this is - you guessed it - reduce the make the picture
fuzzier!

Another cause of similar problems is bad video cable termination creating
reflections and ghosting which under certain conditions can be so severe as
to mimic Moire effects. This is unlikely to occur in all colors with a VGA
display since the termination is internal to the monitor.

These could be a problem with the video source - bad pixels in the video

could be dirt or dead phosphor areas in the CRT. Except for problems with the
on-screen character generator, it is unlikely that the monitor's circuitry
would be generating isolated spots.

You can easily distinguish between video problems and CRT problems - missing
pixels due to the video source will move on the screen as you change raster
position. CRT defects will remain stationary relative to the screen and will
generally be much more sharply delineated as well.

There is a specification for the number and size of acceptable CRT blemishes
so you may have to whine a bit to convince the vendor to provide a

@node 12.3 "Power saving problems"

Modern monitors are usually designed to permit software to control various
levels of power saving ('green') features from blanking the screen to totally
shutting down. Problems can occur if the software to control these features
is not compatible with the monitor or not set up correctly or is attempting
to control a monitor that lacks power saving modes or is defective or
incompatible.

A monitor that behaves normally under most conditions but emits a high
pitched whine when the computer attempts to direct it into power saving mode
is probably not understanding the commands or does not have the appropriate
power saving features. It probably behaves about the same as if there is no
video signal - which indeed may be the case as far as it is concerned.

Many monitors not receiving proper sync signals are perfectly happy driving
everyone in the office insane with that high pitched whine. Others will blow
up eventually.

Recommendation: don't use power saving until you have the proper software. Of
course, your monitor could be defective and your current software is actually
fine. Check your user manuals to determine compatibility and setup
parameters.  Also see the section:

Problem: I have a 17" monitor that has an image that EVER SO SLIGHTLY drifts
to the left (and stops) after a long day's work (heat, I suppose). Also, the
vertical height shrinks a little bit. Is this at all normal/acceptable?

How much is 'ever so slightly'? There are a fair number of components whose
values could alter the position/size of a monitor image. I do not find it at
all surprising that there should be a small shift due to heat. It really
depends on many factors including the basic design, quality of components,
ventilation/cooling, etc. Of course, it is possible to have a monitor that
has a component that is worse with respect to temperature. Could also be
related to line voltage depending on the regulation of your monitor's power
supplies.

In general, my feeling is that if it is not objectionable (a 1/2" shift would
be objectionable) AND it's severity is not changing with time, you can ignore
it.

Many monitors do this. TVs do this but you are not aware of it since they are
already 5-10% overscanned for just this reason, as well as compensating for
component aging and line voltage fluctuations.

A can of cold spray or a heat gun will be useful to track down the bad

It could be the monitor's components have drifted and are now marginal at

Some video cards modify horizontal and vertical frequency as part of their
software size adjustment in their Setup program. For example, with ATI cards,
even though the general resolution option in the DOS Install program may be
800x600 at 75 Hz, adjusting the horizontal size can actually vary the
horizontal frequency over a greater than 10% range. A similar variation is
possible with the vertical rate.

Does just the picture go away or does power die to the monitor? If you can
see the neck of the CRT, the filaments glow orange when it is operating. Does
this glow disappear indicating that the deflection/HV is shutting down?

There could be a number of possibilities - no way of knowing if it will be
easy or inexpensive to repair without testing. It could be power supply, HV
supply, X-ray protection, etc.

@node 12.6 "Monitor flickers when disk accessed"

This is almost certainly a software problem. First, try moving the monitor
away from the PC as far as the cable will stretch. If it still occurs, then
it is probably not the monitor. Could have to do with power saving (just a
guess) or some other incompatibility. Nothing the PC does should affect the
monitor in any way once the refresh rate is set.

@node 12.7 "Buzzing monitor"

Do you actually mean buzz - low frequency as in 50 - 120 Hz? Or, do you
really mean high pitched whine. If the latter, see the section:
@{"High pitched whine or squeal from inside monitor" link "12.8"}

If it is from inside the monitor - make sure it is not your multimedia
speakers or sound card picking up interference - it is in the deflection or
power supply.

There is a slight possibility that the AC power in your home or office has
some harmonic content - the waveform is not sinusoidal. This might be the
case if you try to run on the same circuit as an active dimmer or something
else with thyristor control. Proximity to heavy industry could also cause
this.

The size of the monitor is not a strong indicator of the severity of the
problem but there will be some relationship as the power levels are higher
for larger sets.

Possibly running on a slightly different line voltage may change it but that
is not really an option. You could try a line conditioner (not just surge
suppressor) which includes filtering. I suspect it won't make must
difference.

Sometimes, it is simply a design or manufacturing defect and the only
alternative is a replacement - possibly a different brand. I may be more
difficult to quiet down a buzz than a high pitched whine.

@endnode
@node 12.8 "High pitched whine or squeal from monitor with no other symptoms"

Sometimes this is continuous. In other cases, it comes and goes almost as
though there is an intelligence at work attempting to drive you crazy. All
the more so since a technician may not even be able to hear what you are
complaining about if their hearing is not as sharp at high frequencies as
yours. Even high resolution computer monitors running at high horizontal scan
rates (beyond human hearing) can have these problems due to the switching
power supplies as well as subharmonics of the horizontal scan rate exciting
mechanical resonances in the magnetic components.

Note: if the whine only occurs when the monitor is unplugged from the
computer or the computer is turned off, this is probably normal. Without
valid sync signals the monitor defaults to a horizontal rate which is within
the audible range (less than 20 KHz). Any vibrating components will be
readily heard. It is usually not a sign of impending failure.

There are several parts inside the monitor that can potentially make this
noise - the horizontal flyback transformer and to a lesser extent, the
deflection yoke and associated geometry correction coils would be my first
candidates. In addition, transformers or chokes in the switching power supply
if this is distinct from the horizontal deflection circuitry.

If you are desperate and want to check the inside of the monitor:

Using appropriate safety precautions, you can try prodding the various
suspect parts (flyback, deflection yoke, other transformers) with an
insulated tool such as a dry wooden stick. Listen through a cardboard tube to
try to localizing the source. If the sounds changes, you know what part to go
after. Sometimes a replacement flyback will cure the problem unless it is a
design flaw. You do not want to replace the yoke as convergence and other
adjustments would need to be performed. Other transformers can be replaced.

Sometimes, tightening some mounting screws or wedging a toothpick between the
core and the mounting or coils will help. Coating the offending part with
sealer suitable for electronic equipment may quiet it down but too much may
lead to overheating. Even replacement is no guarantee as the new part may be
worse!

Note that the pitch of the whine - the frequency - may not even be audible to
a technician assigned to address your complaint. The cutoff frequency for our
hearing drops as we get older. Someone over 40 (men more so than women), you
may not be able to hear the whine at all (at least you can look forward to
silence in the future!). So, even sending the monitor back for repair may be
hopeless if the technician cannot hear what you are complaining about and you
are not there to insist they get a second opinion!

@node 12.9 "Monitor was rained on"

Was the set plugged in when the leak started? Any piece of equipment with
remote power-on capability has some portions live at all times when plugged
in and so there may have been damage due to short circuits etc. Substantial
damage could have already been done.

Otherwise, you may just need to give it more time to dry out. I have had
devices with keypads getting wet that required more than a week but then were
fine. There are all kinds of places for water to be trapped and take a long
time to evaporate.

If the monitor got wet while unplugged or it has a mechanical (hard) on/off
switch, then give it a lot of time to dry out completely. Assuming all
visible water is drained, a week represents a minimum safe time to wait.
Don't rush it.

Generally, some moisture will not do any permanent damage unless the set was
on in which case you will simply have to troubleshoot it the old-fashioned
way - one problem at a time.

@node 12.10 "Monitor was dropped"

If your work area is maintained like that of Nedrie in the movie "Jurassic
Park, you might not even notice if one your monitors fell off the table! This
is no way to treat a monitor.

However, mishaps do happen.

Assuming it survived mostly intact - the CRT didn't implode, you could still
have a variety of problems. Immediately unplug the monitor!

If you take it in for service, the estimate you get may make the national
debt look like pocket change in comparison. Attempting to repair anything
that has been dropped is a very uncertain challenge - and since time is money
for a professional, spending an unknown amount of time on a single repair is
very risky. There is no harm is getting an estimate (though many shops charge
for just agreeing that what you are holding was once a - say - a monitor, or
was it a fishtank?)

This doesn't mean you should not tackle it yourself. There may be nothing
wrong or very minor problems that can easily be remedied. The following are
likely possibilities:

  1. Cracked circuit boards. These can be repaired since monitors usually
     have fairly wide open single or two sided boards.

  2. Broken circuit components. These will need to be replaced.

  3. Broken solder connections particularly to large heavy components on
     single sided boards. Reflow the solder. If the trace is cracked or
     lifted, repair as in (1).

  4. Broken mounting brackets. These are usually made of cheap plastic and
     often don't survive very well. Be creative. Obtaining an exact
     replacement is probably not worth the trouble and expense.

  5. Components knocked out of line on the CRT envelope or neck - deflection
     yoke, purity magnets, convergence magnets and coils, geometry correction
     magnets. These will need to be reattached and/or realigned. Some CRTs
     use little magnets glued to the funnel portion of the CRT envelope. If
     any of these have come loose, it could be quite a treat to figure out
     where they went and in what orientation.

  6. Internal damage to the CRT - popped or distorted shadowmask, misaligned
     electron guns. Unfortunately, you will probably have no way of
     identifying these since you cannot see inside the CRT. They will not be
     apparent until all other faults have been remedied and the TV set is
     completely realigned. At that point, extremely severe purity or
     convergence problems that do not respond to the normal adjustment
     procedure would be one indication of internal damage. Give the TV a nice
     funeral.

If you still want to tackle a restoration:

As noted, unplug the monitor even if it looks fine. Until you do a thorough
internal inspection, there is no telling what may have been knocked out of
whack or broken. Electrical parts may be shorting due to a broken circuit
board or one that has just popped free. Don't be tempted to apply power even
if there are no obvious signs of damage - turning it on may blow something
due to a shorting circuit board.

Then, inspect the exterior for cracking, chipping, or dents. In addition to
identifying cosmetic problems, this will help to locate possible areas to
check for internal damage once the covers are removed.

Next, remove the cover. Confirm that the main filter capacitors are fully
discharged before touching anything. Check for mechanical problems like a
bent or deformed brackets, cracked plastic parts, and anything that may have
shifted position or jumped from its mountings. Inspect for loose parts or
pieces of parts - save them all as some critical magnets, for example, are
just glued to the CRT and may have popped off.

Carefully straighten any bent metal parts. Replace parts that were knocked
loose, glue and possibly reinforce cracked or broken plastic. Plastics, in
particular, are troublesome because most glues - even plastic cement - do not
work very well. Using a splint (medical term) or sistering (construction
term) to reinforce a broken plastic part is often a good idea. Use multiple
layers of Duco Cement or clear windshield sealer and screws (sheetmetal or
machine screws may be best depending on the thickness and type of plastic).
Wood glue and Epoxy do not work well on plastic. Some brands of superglue,
PVC pipe cement, or plastic hobby cement may work depending on the type of
plastic.

Inspect for any broken electronic components - these will need to be
replaced. Check for blown fuses - the initial impact may have shorted
something momentarily which then blew a fuse.

There is always a risk that the initial impact has already fried electronic
parts as a result of a momentary short or from broken circuit traces and
there will still be problems even after repairing the visible damage and/or
replacing the broken components. This is most likely if the monitor was
actually on but some modern monitors have circuitry that is energized at all
times. (If power is controlled by a tiny tiny pushbutton this is the case.)

Examine the circuit boards for any visible breaks or cracks. These will be
especially likely at the corners where the stress may have been greatest. If
you find **any** cracks, no matter how small in the circuit board, you will
need to carefully inspect to determine if any circuit traces run across these
cracks. If they do, then there are certainly breaks in the circuitry which
will need to be repaired. Circuit boards in consumer equipment are almost
never more than two layers so repair is possible but if any substantial
number of traces are broken, it will take time and patience. Do not just run
over them with solder as this will not last. Use a fine tipped low wattage
soldering iron and run #22-26 gauge insulated wires between convenient
endpoints - these don't need to be directly on either side of the break.
Double check each connection after soldering for correct wiring and that
there are no shorts before proceeding to the next.

If the circuit board is beyond hope or you do not feel you would be able to
repair it in finite time, replacements may be available but their cost is
likely to be more than the equipment is worth. Locating a junk unit of the
same model to cannibalize for parts may be a more realistic option.

Degauss the monitor as any impact may magnetize the CRT. Power cycling may
work but a manual degaussing is best.

Once all visible damage has been repaired and broken parts have been
replaced, power it up and see what happens. Be prepared to pull the plug if
there are serious problems (billowing smoke or fireworks would qualify).

Perform any purity, convergence, or other realignment as needed.

Then proceed to address any remaining problems one at a time.

@node 12.12 "Setup Adjustments Lost"

Many modern monitors have RAM, somewhat like the CMOS SETUP memory in your
PC, that store all factory adjustments. When power is lost, there is power
surge, lightening strike nearby, nuclear detonation or EMP, it may have put
bad information into the ram and thrown it out of adjustment. There is a way
to get into the service mode (depress and hold a secret button down and turn
set on, special combination of buttons on the remote, etc.) and then use the
remote to reinitialize and adjust the problems out.

HOWEVER, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DOING YOU COULD GIVE YOURSELF WORSE
PROBLEMS. YOU COULD EVEN BLOW THINGS OUT WITH SOME MONITORS!

The service manual will be essential to have any chance of successfully
reinitializing everything without causing damage due to incorrect settings.

If it's not an adjustment problem you probably have a bad part - somewhere.

If you do manage to get into the setup menu and are willing to take the risk
without service information, try not to make any unnecessary changes and
document every change you make!!! That way you can go back if you do anything
wrong (hopefully).

@node 12.13 "Monitor doesn't work after being in storage"

So the monitor you carefully stuffed in a corner of the garage is now totally
dead. You swear it was working perfectly a year ago and just have to get that
state-of-the-art Commodore 64 up and running!

Assuming there was absolutely no action when you turned it on, this has all
the classic symptoms of a bad connection. These could be cold/cracked solder
joints at large components like transformers, power resistors, or connectors
and connectors that need to be cleaned or reseated. By 'no action' I mean not
even a tweet, bleep, or crackle from anything.

To narrow it down further, if careful prodding with a well insulated stick
does not induce the set to come on, check the following:

  1. Locate the horizontal output transistor. It will be in a TO3 metal (most
     likely on an older set) or TOP3 plastic package on a heat sink. With
     power off, measure collector to emitter with an ohmmeter - in at least
     one direction it should be fairly high - 1K or more. Then clip a
     voltmeter on the 250 V DC or higher scale across C-E and plug in and
     turn on the set. Make sure it is well insulated.

      o If the problem is in the low voltage (line) power supply, there will
        be no substantial voltage across C-E.

        You should be able to trace from the power line forward to find the
        bad part though a schematic will help greatly.

      o If the problem is in the startup circuit or horizontal
        oscillator/driver, then there will be something on the order of
        100-160 V across C-E.

        In this case, a schematic may be essential.

Note: don't assume that the metal parts of the chassis are ground - they may
be floating at some line potential.

There is also a slight chance that there is a low voltage regulator in
addition to the horizontal output, so don't get them confused. The horizontal
output transistor will be near the flyback transformer and yoke connector.

If the monitor is a non-name or the company has since gone belly up (no

best described as bad solder joints held together with a little copper. In
this case, prodding with an insulated stick and the use of a few select 4
letter words may get it going. The circuit boards may be double sided with
what were called 'rivlets' for vias. The rivlets were relatively massive -
literally little copper rivets - and they were not adequately heated or
tinned during assembly so there were bucketloads of cold solder joints that
show up during middle age. I repaired one of these by literally resoldering
top and bottom of every one of the darn things with a high wattage iron. Or,
the soldering just may be plain, well, horrible. Carefully going over every
connection is the only solution. Sometimes, removing the solder from suspect
joints, cleaning both the component lead and trace, and then resoldering will
be needed if corrosion has set in.

@node 12.15 "Monitor has burning smell"

Assuming there are no other symptoms:

If this appears after extended operation - an hour or more - it may just be a
build up of dust, dirt, and grime over the years. After understanding the
safety info, some careful vacuuming inside may help. Just don't be tempted to
turn any screws or adjustments!

Dust is attracted to the high voltage section in particular - even the front
faceplate of the CRT collects a lot and should be wiped with a damp cloth
from time to time.

If the symptoms develop quickly - in a few minutes or less, then there could
still be a dust problem - a power resistor may be heating a wad of it but
other possibilities need to be considered.

If not dust, then probably in the power supply but realize that TVs don't
have a nice metal case labeled 'power supply'. It is just a bunch of stuff
scattered around the main board. Without identifying the part that is
heating, a diagnosis is tough especially if the set really does work fine
otherwise. However, if a series regulator were faulty and putting out too
much voltage, the set could appear to work properly but in fact have
excessive power dissipation in certain components. If cleaning the dust does
not solve the problem, you will probably need a schematic to identify the
correct voltages.

@node 12.16 "Loudspeakers and monitors"

Loudspeakers incorporate powerful magnets - the larger the speaker, the
larger the magnet. However, anyone who goes ballistic when the mention is
made of a loudspeaker near a TV or monitor, should take their Valium.

The fringe fields outside the speaker box will not be that great. They may
affect the picture perhaps to the point of requiring degauss. The normal
degauss activated at power-on will usually clear up any color purity problems
(assuming the loudspeakers have been moved away). At worst, manual degauss
will be needed. The CRT will not be damaged. The maximum field - inaccessible
at the voice coil - is quite strong. However, even for non-shielded
loudspeakers, the magnetic field decays rapidly with distance especially
since the core structure is designed to concentrate as much of the field as
possible in the gap where the voice coil travels.

Speakers specifically designed for use with multimedia computers have (or
should have) specially shielded magnet structures which will minimize these
effects. However, if you see any indication of discoloration, move them to a
greater distance.

However, keeping unshielded (e.g., megawatt stereo) speakers away from CRTs
is a good idea.

Now, you really should keep your superconducting magnetic resonance imager
magnet at least in the next room.....

The following story is specifically for a TV but the same applies to any

(Original request from rogerj@apex.com):

     color TV. Wanted me fix bad volume pot..... "oh it has such a good

     glued the case shut!

     Now w/ set open, I turn it on and this picture is LOUSY. Bad color, and
     very poor convergence. But I don't know if I'm to blame for banging it
     around trying to open it up. Also, no hor. or vert. hold. (fixed that
     w/a few caps) This things probably been sitting around for a few years."

Well, you certainly did not kill the caps. Anything that sits for a few years
- probably in a damp unheated attic - is suspect.

Did you find the adjustments on the yoke assembly tight? If so, you probably
did not move anything very much either. She may remember the good picture it
produced before being stuffed away in the attic.

     "Anyway after going through all the adjustments, the convergence at the
     sides is still bad and the horizontal size is a tad insufficient (w/no
     adjustment available)"

Could be that the convergence (including pincushion) circuits are still
faulty - not just misadjusted.

Other things that can effect horizontal size while still giving you a
complete picture:

  1. Voltage to horizontal output transistor low. Is there a voltage
     regulator in your set? The one I have has none. I assume your line
     voltage is ok.

  2. Increased resistance or inductance of the yoke windings. For all you
     know, the yoke may have been replaced with the wrong part.

  3. Yoke improperly positioned on tube neck.

  4. Excessive high Voltage. This is usually not adjustable.

I bet the thing hasn't worked properly in 10 years.

@node 12.20 "Disposing of dead monitors (CRTs and charged HV capacitors)"

I don't know what the law says, but for safety, here is my recommendation:

Treat the CRT with respect - the implosion hazard should not be minimized. A
large CRT will have over 10 tons of air pressure attempting to crush it. Wear
eye protection whenever dealing with the CRT. Handle the CRT by the front -
not the neck or thin funnel shaped envelope. Don't just toss it in the
garbage - it is a significant hazard. The vacuum can be safely released (let
out? what does one do with a vacuum?) without spectacular effects by breaking
the glass seal in the center of the CRT socket (may be hidden by the indexing
plastic of the socket). Cover the entire CRT with a heavy blanket when doing
this for additional protection. Once the vacuum is gone, it is just a big
glass bottle though there may be some moderately hazardous materials in the
phosphor coatings and of course, the glass and shadowmask will have many
sharp edges if it is broken.

In addition, there could be a nice surprise awaiting anyone disconnecting the
HV wire - that CRT capacitance can hold a charge for quite a while. Since it
is being scrapped, a screwdriver under the suction cap HV connector should
suffice.

The main power supply filter caps should have discharged on their own after
any reasonable length of time (measured in terms of minutes, not days or
years).

Of course around here, TVs and monitors (well, wishful thinking as I have yet
to see a decent monitor on the curb) are just tossed intact which is
fortunate for scavengers like me who would not be happy at all with pre-safed

There are parts in the monitor which may get hotter with SVGA but if it is

A good quality multisync monitor should not mind switching screen resolutions
frequently (though doing it every few seconds continuously may stretch this a

Newer multisync monitors should also be smart enough not to blow up if you
feed then a scan rate which exceeds their capabilities. However, there are a

This question arises in a PC software development environment where the

Obviously, without knowing the precise design of your monitor, there can be
no definitive answer. It is true that some older monitors blew up if you
looked at them the wrong way. Newer monitors from well known manufacturers
like Nokia, NEC, and many others are designed with a moderate amount of scan
switching in mind. However this is stressful for the monitor's power supply
and deflection circuitry. I would suggest that you use a dedicated mono
monitor for debugging if you really are switching multiple times per minute.
If you cannot afford the space, you can probably assume that if the first few
days of this kind of treatment have not induced a failure, the monitor is
robust enough to withstand it indefinitely. If you really are switching many
times per minute 8 hours or more a day, then what may wear out are the
internal relays (the clicks you hear are from these). You are still talking
about years, however. They are rated in 100s of thousands or millions of
operations when used within their ratings.

Or, just go for the peace of mind of an extended warranty or service

@node 13.3 "Tony's notes on setting convergence on delta gun CRTs"

(This section from: ard12@eng.cam.ac.uk (A.R. Duell))

The older delta-gun tubes (3 guns in a triangle, not in a line) can give
EXCELLENT pictures, with very good convergence, provided:

  1. You've set those 20-or-so presets correctly - a right pain as they
     interact to some extent.

  2. The CRT is set up in the final position - this type of tube is more
     sensitive to external fields than the PIL type.

Both my delta-gun sets (a B&O 3200 chassis and a Barco CDCT2/51) have very
clearly set out and labeled convergence panels, and you don't need a service
manual to do them. The instructions in the Barco manual are something like:

     "Apply crosshatch, and adjust the controls on the convergence board in
     the numbered order to converge the picture. The diagrams by each control
     show the effect"

Here's a very quick guide to delta gun convergence where the settings are
done using various adjustments on the neck of the CRT (if you don't have a
service manual but do know what each control does, and where they all are -
otherwise, follow the instructions in the service manual --- sam):

  1. Apply a white crosshatch or dot pattern to the set. Don't try and
     converge on anything else - you'll go insane. It's useful to be able to
     switch between those 2 patterns.

  2. Before you start, set the height, width, linearity, pincushion, etc.
     They will interact with the convergence. Also check PSU voltages, and
     the EHT voltage if it's adjustable. That's where you do need a service
     manual, I guess.

  3. Turn off the blue gun using the A1 switch, and use the red and green
     static radial controls to get a yellow croshatch in the middle of the
     screen. These controls may be electrical presets, or may be movable
     magnets on the radial convergence yoke (the Y-shaped think behind the
     deflection yoke).

  4. Turn on the blue gun and use the 2 blue static controls (radial and
     lateral) to align the blue and yellow crosshatches at the center of the
     screen. Some manufacturers recommend turning off the green gun when
     doing this, and aligning red with blue (using ONLY the blue controls, of
     course), but I prefer to align blue with yellow, as it gives a check on
     the overall convergence of the tube.

  5. Turn off the blue gun again. Now the fun starts - dynamic convergence.
     The first adjustments align the red and green crosshatches near the
     edges - I normally do the top and bottom first. There will be 2 controls
     for this, either a top and a bottom, or a shift and a linearity. The
     second type is a PAIN to do, as it's not uncommon for it to affect the
     static convergence.

  6. Getting the red and green verticals aligned near the edges is a similar
     process.

  7. You now have (hopefully) a yellow crosshatch over the entire screen.

  8. Now to align the blue. This is a lot worse, although the principle is
     the same. Turn on the blue gun again, and check the static (center)
     convergence

  9. To align the blue lines with the yellow ones, you'll find not only shift
     controls, but also slope controls. Use the shift controls to align the
     centers of the lines and the slope controls to get the endpoints right.
     These interact to some extent. You'll need to fiddle with the controls
     for a bit to work out what they do, even if you have the manual.

The convergence over the entire screen should now be good....

A word of warning here... The purity is set by ring magnets on almost all
colour CRTs, but on PIL tubes, there are other ring magnets as well - like
static convergence. Make sure you know what you are adjusting.

@node 13.4 "Use of surge suppressors and line filters"

Should you always use a surge suppressor outlet strip or line circuit? Sure,
it shouldn't hurt. Just don't depend on these to provide protection under all
circumstances. Some are better than others and the marketing blurb is at best
of little help in making an informed selection. Product literature - unless
it is backed up by testing from a reputable lab - is usually pretty useless
and often confusing.

Line filters can also be useful if power in you area is noisy or prone to
spikes or dips.

However, keep in mind that most well designed electronic equipment already
includes both surge suppressors like MOVs as well as L-C line filters. More
is not necessarily better but may move the point of failure to a readily
accessible outlet strip rather than the innards of your equipment if damage
occurs.

Very effective protection is possible through the use of a UPS
(Uninterruptible Power Supply) which always runs the equipment off its
battery from the internal invertor (not all do). This provides very effective
isolation power line problems as the battery acts as a huge capacitor. If
something is damaged, it will likely be the UPS and not your expensive
equipment. Another option is to use a constant voltage transformer (SOLA)
which provides voltage regulation, line conditioning, and isolation from
power spikes and surges.

It is still best to unplug everything if the air raid sirens go off or you
see an elephant wearing thick glasses running through the neighborhood (or an
impending lightening storm).

@node 13.5 "GFCI tripping with monitor (or other high tech equipment)"

Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) are very important for minimizing
shock hazards in kitchens, bathrooms, outdoors and other potentially wet
areas. They are now generally required by the NEC Code in these locations.
However, what the GFCI detects to protect people - an imbalance in the
currents in the Hot and Neutral wires caused possibly by someone touching a
live conductor - may exist safely by design in 3 wire grounded electronic
equipment and result in false tripping of the GFCI. The reason is that there
are usually small capacitors between all three wire - Hot, Neutral, and
Ground in the RFI line filters of computer monitors, PCs, and printers. At
power-on and even while operating, there may be enough leakage current
through the capacitors between Hot and Ground in particular to trip the GFCI.
Even for ungrounded 2 wire devices, the power-on surge into inductive or
capacitive loads like switching power supplies may falsely trip the GFCI.
This is more likely to happen with multiple devices plugged into the same
GFCI protected outlet especially if they are controlled by a common power
switch.

Therefore, I do not recommend the use of a GFCI for computer equipment as
long as all 3 wire devices are connected to properly grounded circuits. The
safety ground provides all the protection that is needed.

@node 13.6 "Monitors on foreign power"

Using a monitor on a different voltage or frequency is usually not a serious
problem.

Your PC and monitor should be fine requiring a most a transformer (not just
an adapter for heating appliances, however) to convert the voltage. They both
use witching power supplies which don't care about the line frequency.

Some power supplies are universal - they automatically adapt to the voltage
they are fed without requiring even a transformer but don't assume this -
check you user manual or contact the manufacturer(s) to determine if jumpers
or switches need to be changed. You could blow up the PC or monitor by
attempting to run it on 220 VAC when set of 115 VAC. If you are lucky, only a
fuse will blow but don't count on it.

For non-switching power supply devices like printers and wall adapters that
use line power transformers, in addition to matching the voltage (or setting
jumpers or switches), running on a lower line frequency may be a problem.
There is a slight chance that the power transformer will overheat on 50 Hz if
designed for 60 Hz. (The other way around should be fine.) It is best to
check the nameplate - it should tell you. If it does not, then best to
contact the manufacturer.

@node 13.7 "Lifespans of Monitors"

Most manufacturers will quote an MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure) of somewhere
in the 30,000 to 60,000 hour range, EXCLUSIVE OF the CRT. The typical CRT,
without an extended-life cathode, is usually good for 10,000 to 15,000 hours
before it reaches half of its initial brightness. Note that, if you leave
your monitor on all the time, a year is just about 8,000 hours.

The only "tuneup" that a monitor should need, exclusive of adjustments needed
following replacement of a failed component, would be video amplifier and/or
CRT biasing adjustments to compensate for the aging of the tube. These are
usually done only if you're using the thing in an application where exact
color/brightness matching is important. Regular degaussing of the unit may be
needed, of course, but I'm not considering that a "tuneup" or adjustment.

@node 13.8 "Monitor life, energy conservation, and laziness"

A common misconception about the care and feeding of computer monitors is
that they should be left on all the time. While there are some advantages to
this, there are many more disadvantages:

  1. CRT Life: The life of a monitor is determined by the life of the CRT.
     The CRT is by far the most expensive single part and it is usually not
     worth repairing a monitor in which the CRT requires replacement. The
     brightness half-life of a CRT is usually about 10-15 K hours of on time
     independent of what is being displayed on the screen. 10 K hours is only
     a little more than a year. By not turning the monitor off at night, you
     are reducing the life of the monitor by a factor of 2-3. Screen savers
     do not make any substantial difference especially with modern displays
     using X-Windows or MS Windows where the screen layout is not fixed. With
     video display terminals, the text always came up in the same position
     and eventually burned impressions into the screen phosphor.

  2. Component life: The heat generated inside a monitor tends to dry out
     parts like electrolytic capacitors thus shortening their life. These
     effects are particularly severe at night during the summer when the air
     conditioning may be off but it is still a consideration year around.

  3. Safety: While electronic equipment designed and manufactured in
     accordance with the National Electrical Codes is very safe, there is
     always a small risk of catastrophic failure resulting in a fire. With no
     one around, even with sprinklers and smoke alarms, such an failure could
     be much more disasterous.

  4. Energy use: While modern monitors use a lot less energy than their older
     cousins, the aggregate energy usage is not something to be ignored. A
     typical monitor uses between 60 and 200 Watts. Thus at a $.10 per KWH
     electric rate such a monitor will cost between $48 and $160 a year for
     electricity. During the night, 1/2 to 2/3 of this is wasted for every
     monitor that is left on. If air conditioning is on during the night,
     then there is the additional energy usage needed to remove this heat as
     well - probably about half the cost of the electricity to run the
     monitor.

The popular rationalization for what is most often just laziness is that
power-on is a stressful time for any electronic device and reducing the
number of power cycles will prolong the life of the monitor. With a properly
designed monitor, this is rarely an issue. Can you recall the last time a
monitor blew up when it was turned on? The other argument, which has more
basis in reality is that the thermal cycling resulting from turning a monitor
on and off will shorten its life. It is true that such thermal stress can
contribute to various kinds of failures due to bad solder connections.
However, these can be easily repaired and do not effect the monitor's heart -
the CRT. You wouldn't leave your TV on 24 hours a day, would you?

Some of the newest ('green') monitors have energy conserving capabilities.
However, it is necessary for the software to trigger these power reduction or
power down modes. Few monitors in actual use and fewer workstations or PCs
are set up to support these features. If you have such a monitor and computer
to support it, by all means set up the necessary power off/power down timers.
However, using the power saving modes of a 'green' PC with an older monitor
can potentially cause damage since some of the modes disable the sync
signals. A 'green' monitor which can detect a blank screen and and use this
as a trigger can easily be used with a screen saver which can be set to
display a blank screen - on any PC or workstation.

Please make it a habit to turn your monitors off at night. This will extend
the life of the monitor (and your investment) and is good for the environment
as well. For workstations, there are good reasons to leave the system unit on
all the time. However, the monitor should be turned off using its power
switch. For PCs, my recommendation is that the entire unit be turned off at
night since the boot process is very quick and PCs are generally not required
to be accessible over a network 24 hours a day.

@node 13.9 "About sync polarity options"

Many video cards provide polarity options for each scan mode. Why?

Probably to be compatible with older monitors. Most modern monitors are auto
polarity detecting so the settings should not matter.

(Note that some of the digital PC video standard did have specific sync
polarity specifications.)

Some software programs that directly access the video card may even be
changing sync polarity - for apparently no reason - without you being aware
of it.

Your video card determines the maximum video rate you can generate. The
monitor has to be able to lock to it. So, if you cannot setup higher than
some specified rate (i.e., the options do not exist in your menu), it is a
function of the video card and drivers. If you can set it but the monitor
displays garbage or nothing at all, it is a limitation of the monitor. The
sync polarity rarely makes any difference and if it does, the effects will be
obvious - picture shifted left/right/up/down on screen - or just won't sync
at all.

If you experience problems of this type, experimenting with the sync polarity
may be instructive.

If you do not know what your monitor wants and you have the option, set both
horizontal and vertical sync polarities to be negative as this is nearly
always acceptable (for studio video and VGA/SVGA monitors).

@node 13.10 "Identifying connections on unknown or cut monitor cables"

Obviously, this is best done with a schematic. However, since such a luxury
may not be possible, how can you go about figuring out where all the wires
go?  Easy answer - very carefully.

For the following, I assume a VGA/SVGA monitor. You need to identify the
grounds, video signals, H and V sync, and monitor sense lines. The procedure
is described with respec to a cut cable but if you are trying to identify an
unknown connector type on the monitor, the same comments apply to the wiring
INSIDE the monitor.

First identify the grounds. Use an ohmmeter between each wire and the shell
of the video connector on the monitor. Resistance will be less than an ohm
for the ground wires. These will often be colored black. The shields of the
RGB coaxes will also be connected to ground.

The high bandwidth video signals will always use individual coaxial cables.
These may even be color coded red, green, and blue. If not, you can determine
which is which later on. If there are only three such coaxes, they are the
video signals. If there are four, the extra one may be the H sync. If there
are five, the extra two may be the H and V syncs. Testing between these wires
and ground with an ohmmeter should measure 75 ohms for the video
terminations.

Display a lively screen on your PC at a resolution you know the monitor
should support (remember, trying to drive a monitor of unknown scan rate
specifications beyond its ratings is like playing Russian Roulette.) When in
doubt, VGA (640x480, 31.4 KHz H, 60 Hz V) should be safe.

Turn up the brightness and contrast on the monitor. If you are lucky, even
without any sync, there will be a visible raster. Set it to be just visible.
If there is none, then it should appear once there is valid sync.

You will need to bring out wires from the video connector on your PC.

Connect the ground of your video card to the ground wires you already
identified on the monitor cable.

Attach a wire in series with a 200-500 ohm resistor to H sync (pin 13) on the
VGA connector.

Momentarily touch the end of this wire to each of the remaining unidentified
wires (including the coaxes if you have 4 or 5 of these and it is not obvious
which are the video signals) on the monitor. When you find the H sync input,
the raster should lock in and probably brighten up. If the monitor was
originally whining due to lack of sync, it should quiet down.

Once you have located H sync, you can remove the resistor and connect the
wire up directly.

Now, attach the video signals. It is likely that you will now have a picture
but it will be rolling on the screen. Some monitors, however, will not
unblank until they receive both valid H and V sync. Use your resistor with
the V sync output of the video card (Pin 14) on the remaining unidentified
wires. Once you find the V sync input, the display should lock in solid.

The only remaining unknowns are the monitor sense lines. For older monitors -
those without the ACCESS.bus interface, you can just wire up the sense lines
to the appropriate levels (Color: ID0 (Pin 11) to ground, ID1 (Pin 12) NC.

See the document "Pinouts for various connectors in Real Life(tm)" for
detailed hookup information. Replacement VGA connectors are readily
available.

@node 13.11 "CRT Replacement - probably not worth it"

The sad fact is that even if you can obtain a new CRT you won't have the
proper set up for getting proper alignment and convergence. They generally
use various permanent magnet glued to the perimeter of the yoke to set the
geometry of the raster. It takes a special factory jig to do this step or
really great persistence and patience. However, if you have the time and will
resist punching a hole in the new CRT before you finish, by all means.

Also, consider the cost of a new CRT may be more than half the cost of the
monitor when it was new.

A better (or at least less stressful) approach is to locate a monitor that
died due to a circuit problem and salvage the CRT including the yoke and all
the other magical magnets and coils.

Replacing a monochrome CRT is a snap in comparison.

@node 13.12 "An informal history of X-ray protection"

(The following is from: Marty).

Most of the old tube type color TV sets used a shunt HV regulator tube,
usually a 6BK4. If it failed, or some component in the HV circuit failed, the
high voltage, normally 25KV, could go up to 35KV or more, causing some X-Ray
leakage from the CRT. In the early 70s when news of this radiation scare was
first announced, there was a public outcry to immediately fix the problem.
The  feds hastily imposed a requirement on manufacturers of TV sets to
somehow  render a TV set "unwatchable" if the HV exceeded rated limits.

The manufacturers first response was to follow the letter of the law and the
first "HEW" circuit simply blanked the video when the HV exceeded a setpoint
to make the set "unwatchable".

It was quickly noticed that the HV was not turned off with this circuit and
the CRT still could emit some radiation. Many TV sets with this feature were
left on so the consumer could listen to the sound, so the feds tightened the
requirement.

By this time new TV sets were all solid state and some manufacturers
experimented with HV shutdown circuits, but most of these circuits were
poorly  designed and not reliable.

Zenith thought they had the answer by regulating the HV with a bank of 5
capacitors across the horizontal output transistor to "hold down" the HV to
25KV. If one capacitor opened, the HV would only rise about 2KV, not a
dangerous situation. This wasn't good enough for the feds.

The "fix" that Zenith finally came out with, was a "4 legged capacitor. Two
legs were the emitter return for the horizontal output transistor, & two legs
were the HV holddown capacitor (the equivalent value of the bank of 5 caps).
This "fix" was accepted by HEW and millions of TVs were produced. It worked
so well, that other manufacturers soon followed the lead (Magnavox, GE,
etc.).

Then the worst happened! The 4 legged monsters started failing in a large
numbers. Not opening completely & not shorting out. They sometimes allowed
the  HV to skyrocket to over 50KV. Some of them even cut the necks off of the
CRTs.

Zenith issued a recall on those models with the problem (more than one entire
model year). After several "improved" versions of the capacitor, the problem
was fixed but that recall almost bankrupted the company. Other companies had
failures too, but usually not as dramatic as Zenith's.

Magnavox used the HV holddown capacitor, both single & 4 leg version in
several 70s era TV sets and is a good candidate for fireworks as well.

@node 13.13 "Turning a TV (or monitor) into an oscilloscope?"

This question comes up so often and it does sound like a neat project to give
a defunct TV a second life. Don't expect to end up with a Tek 465 on the
cheap when you are done. However, it could be a fun learning experience.

You will be severely limited in the performance of such a scope. TVs and
monitors are designed to operate at a very narrow range of horizontal scan
rates and the high voltage is usually derived from the horizontal deflection.
So, you would need to retain the original deflection system for this purpose
at least.

  1. You will need to disconnect the defection yoke from the horizontal and
     vertical deflection circuits of the TV or monitor without killing the
     HV. (also, doing all this without killing yourself as well). Depending
     on the design, this may be as simple as unplugging the yoke connector.
     More than likely, you will need to substitute a load for the horizontal
     deflection coil. A coil from another sacrificial similar TV or monitor
     would probably suffice.

     Warning: at this point you have a really bright spot in the middle of
     the screen which will turn to a really black spot if the brightness is
     not turned way down really really quickly.

  2. For the horizontal, you need a ramped current source. You are driving a
     non-ideal inductor (the deflection coil) so it has both inductance and
     resistance. Thus the waveform is a trapezoid - a voltage ramp (for the
     resistive part) superimposed on a voltage step (for the inductive part).
     This should not be too difficult. Don't expect to be able to achieve
     really fast sweep. Even running at normal TV rates is non-trivial.

  3. Similarly, for the vertical you need to drive with a voltage (your
     signal) controlled current source. However, if you just screwing around,
     then the linearity etc. for the vertical may not be that important. In
     this case, one way is to put a current sensing resistor in series with
     the deflection coil and use this in a power op amp type of feedback
     arrangement. (You could do this for (2) as well.

  4. There is a good chance that the original brightness control will work as
     an intensity adjustment. However, with some TVs and monitors, this
     depends on receiving a valid video signal. You may need to improvise. If
     you do want to control the intensity from a signal source, you should be
     able to tap into the drive signals going to the little board on the neck
     of the CRT.

  5. Don't expect high bandwidth, uniform response, or any of the other
     things you take for granted with a decent scope. That takes work.
     However, as a fun project, this certainly qualifies. Interchanging the
     functions of the horizontal and vertical deflection yoke (and rotating
     it 90 degrees) may provide a better match of horizontal and vertical
     bandwidth to your intended applications or experiments.

  6. SAFETY: Once you disconnect the deflection yoke from the TV or monitor's
     circuits, move the original circuits out of the way and put a barrier
     between between you and the rest of the TV or monitor. All you will need
     are connections to the deflection yoke on the CRT (unless you want to do
     could be pretty interesting but there may be color fringing effects
     since you are not compensating for certain aspects of dynamic
     convergence at all.

@node 13.14 "Displaying a video signal as a picture on an oscilloscope"

I am not sure why anyone would really want to do this other than as an
experiment - it would be interesting one.

If a composite video signal is the input, you will need a sync separator. For
VGA, the sync signals are already available.

You will have to construct a vertical deflection voltage ramp generator which
can be locked to your vertical sync signal.

The horizontal timebase of the scope will be fine for the horizontal
deflection and should easily lock to your horizontal sync pulse or (if the
scope has a TV trigger mode) directly to the video signal.

A video amplifier will be needed if your Z axis does not have an internal
amplifier (you need .7 V p-p to be full brightness range.) Unless you provide
automatic gain control, this will need to include offset (brightness) and
gain (contrast) adjustments. Even if there is an internal amplifier, it may
not have the required bandwidth for the video signal.

However, the overall brightness may be disappointing - a scope is not
designed for overall high brightness. The beam focus will not be as good as
that on a little TV either.

@node 13.15 "Could a monitor be modified for 3D (stereo) display?"

The whole idea of stereo 3-D vision to put the left and right views to the
appropriate eyeball. There are two common ways of doing this:

  1. Use different colors for the two views with color filters in from of
     each eye to separate the views. This is what were often used for the
     really bad (content wise) sci-fi movies of the '50s.

  2. Display alternate views on the same monitor screen but use LCD shutter
     glasses to allow each eye to only see the appropriate view. This
     requires increasing the refresh rate to avoid unacceptable flicker.

The first approach can be used with any TV and a pair of monochrome video
cameras. Of course, true color cannot be used since pure colored images are
needed to separate the stereo views.

Alternating views with synchronized LCD glasses is a possibility but and has
been used commercially but requires special hardware to synchronize to the
computer's video card. Best results are obtained with refresh rates of at
least 120 Hz permitting 60 full left-right frames per second. If you try to
this with a regular TV or CGA monitor, the resulting refresh rate would be 30
Hz with a 50% duty cycle which is likely to be useful only as a short
experiment - else your viewers will likely develop splitting headaches.

@node 13.16 "Using a workstation monitor on a PC"

These are nearly always fixed frequency monitors with a scan rate that is not
compatible with typical SVGA cards.

They may have a special connector like a 13W3 or 3, 4, or 5 BNC connectors.
Some have a non-standard connector.

While these normally use standard analog video signal levels, you have a
couple of problems out of the starting gate:

  1. The fixed scanning frequencies of most of these monitors are not
     directly compatible with typical SVGA standards. Many high end boards
     like the ATI ProTurbo can scan at 1280x1024 probably at an appropriate
     refresh (horizontal is going to be the critical one) rate. Also, boards
     that allow software adjustment of size (like the ATI) are in effect
     changing scan rates as well so that gives another degree or two of
     freedom.

     However, many typical video cards do not provide this degree of
     flexibility.

  2. The monitor needs sync-on-green (3 BNC connectors), composite H and V
     sync (4 BNC connectors and 13W3) or at least a VGA to BNC adapter cable
     (5 BNC connectors). Your VGA card normally puts out separate syncs.

     Many video cards have a software mode (probably accessible in the setup
     program) to enable composite sync output so for these at least there is
     no problem with a 4 BNC monitor.

     You can build a circuit to generate the required video for a 3 BNC
     monitor if you are so inclined. See the "Sync on Green FAQ" for detailed
     information and schematics.

  3. What you do for booting since the default will be VGA (at least for
     DOS/Windows. If you only use your PC at one fixed high resolution, than
     this may not be that much of a problem...

There are specialized boards that will emulate standard VGA/SVGA modes using

@node 13.17 "Displaying TV on a computer monitor"

My general recommendation is that if you have the space, buy an inexpensive
TV - the quality in the end may in fact be better. And, it will be usable
without tying up your expensive monitor and (maybe) PC.

Some older monitors like the Mitsubishi AUM1381 and Emerson CGA (which also
has a speaker) include a composite NTSC input jack requiring only a baseband
video source like a VCR. These do produce a very nice picture. However, most
newer multiscan monitors do not go to low enough horizontal scan rates.

To display NTSC or PAL on these requires a scan convertor (likely to be very
expensive) or at least a scan doubler (less expensive but not as good).

You can also buy video input cards complete with tuners ('PCTV') which will
put TV into a window and allow you to idle away the time you are supposed to
be working while watching 'Mork and Mindy'.

While various convertors are advertized to use a computer monitor with video
from a VCR or other source, keep in mind that if it sounds too good to be
true, it probably is like the claim of a $200 box for this:

OK, let me get this straight - this card/box will enable a 31.4 KHz
horizontal scan rate monitor (VGA) be used as a TV - yes or no? It thus
includes a video A/D, full screen frame buffer, D/A, and all the other tuner
stuff for under $200? I don't think so. A scan doubler - which is a subset of
the above - will not result in a high quality picture since it will display
pairs of lines interleaved. Or does the impressive advertisement leave out
the key requirement that the monitor sync at the NTSC horizontal scan rate of
15.734 KHz (most newer monitor do not)? Or is it a board that plugs into a PC
and indeed does use the resources of the PC including the VGA card and bus?

In any case, get a written money back satisfaction guarantee.

@node 13.18 "Displaying computer video on a TV"

Assuming this means NTSC:

  1. You need to convert RGB to NTSC - there are single chips for this. Try
     Sony, Philips, Motorola, and others. These will combine the R, G, B, H
     sync, and V sync into a single composite video signal using a minimum of
     additional components.

  2. You need to match the scan rate to NTSC - 15.734 KHz horizontal. Even
     basic VGA is twice this - 31.4 KHz. If your video card can be programmed
     to put out interlaced NTSC rate video then this is easy. If not, it is
     more difficult. If you want to use anything higher res than VGA, it is a
     very non-trivial problem requiring the construction of a scan convertor
     which includes a video A/D, full frame store, interpolator/readout
     timing, video D/A. Unless you are an experienced digital/analog
     designer, you really do not want to tackle any of this.

For the special case of VGA->NTSC, you may be able to get away with just
storing a single scan line since the horizontal frequency is (almost) exactly
twice the NTSC horizontal of 15.734 KHz. A double buffer where one buffer is
storing while the other is reading out at approximately half the VGA pixel
rate should work. With appropriate timing, even lines become the even field
for NTSC and odd lines become the odd field (I may have this backwards). It
is still not a trivial undertaking. Also, keep in mind that the quality you
will get on NTSC will be poorer than the VGA due to fundamental NTSC
bandwidth limitations. Also, flicker for line graphics will be significant
due to the interlacing at 30 Hz. Even this is a non-trivial undertaking.

The requirements for PAL are very similar. For 625 lines systems, the 800x600
is the format that most closely matches the TV resolution.

You can also buy little boxes to do this. Quality is general not great as you
are seriously limited by NTSC/PAL and the VCR. Except for presentations on
existing TV rate equipment, it is probably not worth the effort. This is
totally useless for any serious computer applications.

For professional presentations, modern video projectors are available that
use high resolution LCD panels and real-time scan conversion. However, they
are quite expensive (up to $10,000!!!).

@node 13.19 "What is Kell factor with respect to interlaced displays?"

(The following is from Bob Myers (myers@fc.hp.com)).

The Kell factor - which has to do with the fact that we're often
undersampling an image from the standpoint of the Gospel According to St.
Nyquist - IS a factor in the reduction of vertical resolution, but
interlacing plays a part as well. This comes from at least two factors:

  1. The receiver usually cannot precisely interleave the two fields.

  2. More importantly, there are steps taken to reduce the interline flicker
     which reduce the effective vertical resolution. This includes running
     the line width of the display somewhat larger than would otherwise be
     the case, and in interlaced cameras, discharging the entire screen
     (including the lines from the "other" field) after every field scanned.

Interlace is particularly troublesome on moving images, where you will often
perceive momentarily "missing" details. There was a LOT of discussion
regarding the gory details of interlacing in the recent HDTV debates within
SMPTE and other groups.

@node 13.20 "Weird phenomenon of the month"

Talk about unusual. This was posted to sci.electronics:

     "Something VERY strange is happening, and I can't explain it.

     There is a "ghost" on my TV screen of the text appearing on my computer
     screen. They are NOT hooked together in any manner. They are about 4-5
     feet apart. Although, the antenna cable runs within a foot of my
     computer. I am wondering what causes this to happen. I have experienced
     interference, but this is more like a wireless second monitor. I can
     turn off my monitor, and look over at the TV. The text on the TV is
     scrolling up every 9 seconds. (like when the v-hold isn't adjusted.) Any
     Ideas?"

This is probably caused by RFI - radio frequency interference - from a CGA or
PC TV card being picked up on the TV's cable or antenna. Only CGA has a scan
rate that is nearly the same as NTSC. Any other PC video scan rate would
result in a torn up or rolling picture.

@node 13.21 "Ultra cheap degaussing coil"

Pack Rat Trick #457384

Next time you scrap a computer monitor (or tv), save the degaussing coil
(coil of wire, usually wrapped in black tap or plastic) mounted around the
front of the tube. To adapt it for degaussing sets, wrap it into a smaller
coil, maybe 4"-6". To limit the current to something reasonable, put it in
series with a light bulb (60-100W). You need AC current to degauss, so just
put the bulb in series with the coil and use the your local 120V outlet. BE
VERY CAREFUL that you actually wired it in series, and that everything is
properly insulated before you plug it in. (A fuse would be a real good idea
too!!)

A few circles over the affected area will usually do it. Note that it will
also make your screen go crazy for a little bit, but this will fade out
within a minute or so.

Just a couple of points for emphasis:

  1. The coil as removed from the TV is not designed for continuous operation
     across the line as indicated above. In fact, it will go up in a mass of
     smoke without the light bulb to limit the current. The poor TV from
     which this organ was salvaged included additional circuitry to ramp the
     current to 0 in a few seconds after power is turned on.

  2. Reducing the coil size by a factor of 2 or 3 will increase the intensity
     of the magnetic field which is important since we are limiting the
     current with the light bulb to a value lower than the TV used. You don't
     need to unwind all the magnet wire, just bend the entire assembly into a
     smaller coil. Just make sure that the current is always flowing in the
     same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) around the coil.

  3. Insulate everything very thoroughly with electrical tape. A pushbutton
     momentary switch rated for 2 amps at 115 volts AC would be useful so
     that you do not need to depend on the wall plug to turn it on and off.

@node 13.22 "Big Al's rules of thumb on monitor repair"

  1. Use an isolation transformer. A variac can be helpful too. A cheap
     isolation transformer can be constructed by wiring two identical
     transformers of adequate power capability back-to-back. (Here is a use
     for those old boat anchors you can't bear to part with).

  2. If it's just the power supply or flyback switching transistors that have
     failed, then the repair is probably easy enough and quick enough to be
     worthwhile. Blown power transistors are trivial to locate in the circuit
     and quite easy to find replacements for. In many cases I've found that
     the monitor would have lived a much longer life if only the transistor
     mounting screws had been tightened properly by the manufacturer. Make
     sure you use appropriate replacements and the proper heat sink parts and
     heat sink compound.

  3. If it's the flyback transformer, then judgement should be made based on
     the cost and availability of the replacement part. Also, on the risk of
     there being additional problems beyond that of the bad flyback. Who
     get's to eat the cost of the part in the event you don't succeed and
     give up? However, determining that the flyback is indeed at fault may
     prove challenging without a flyback tester. Sometimes there will be
     obvious damage such as burnt marks, cracked plastic, or other signs of
     overheating. If you have the correct resistance measurements, then for
     the primary you may be able to detect shorted windings. You can also
     construct the brute force flyback tester at the end of the document.

  4. If it's the CRT then make the project "someone else's problem" and give
     the monitor to someone else to use as a parts carcass. My life is much
     happier since I learned there is no disgrace in making this choice.

  5. There is another common failure category which is a result of people who
     are too lazy to turn off the power switch at night. The constant heat
     causes the electrolytic capacitors to dry out and become intermittent. I
     often replace all of the smallest electrolytics in the power supply
     section especially when I know the switching transistor is good. If
     after a couple of hours of labor and a dozen caps I still don't have it
     running, I give up on these too.

  6. Be realistic with yourself about the value of a used working monitor.
     CGA's EGA's and monochrome Hercules monitors rarely fetch more than $25
     at a swap meet.

  7. Don't sell a used monitor to a friend unless you want to continue
     repairing the thing until you're old and grey.

  8. Don't put a scope on the collector of the supply or flyback transistors,
     unless you have a special X100 high voltage / high frequency scope
     probe.

@node 13.23 "Tic-Toc Tips"

(The following is based on a set of notes provided by Andy Laberge
(tic-toc@wolfenet.com))

  1. When you go to discharge the anode of a picture tube make sure you hook
     up your ground first or you may get an unexpected surprise. I have.

  2. Picture tubes will hold their charge for a long time. In fact I have
     been bitten from a tube that was removed from a TV, discharged and
     allowed to sit for six months. Treat all picture tubes as though they
     were fully charged.

  3. There is a practical reason for using an isolation transformer for
     troubleshooting monitors besides the safety issue. The primary side of
     the power supply is isolated from ground and if you start probing it
     with a grounded scope you will short out components that were perfectly
     good until then. It will cost you more time in trouble shooting and more
     money.

  4. When looking for real small cracks in a monitor board try to use a
     strong indirect light to keep the glare and reflections to a minimum.
     You can loose a crack in the glare. Cracks also hide underneath the
     solder mask (the green stuff). I have scrapped away the solder mask and
     there pretty as you please is that little beggar. Next you want to fix
     it; scrap more solder mask off the trace about 1/2" on both sides of the
     crack. Brighten the copper using an ink eraser (it has abrasive grit in
     it). Tin the exposed copper very well and then solder on a piece of bare
     tinned buss wire. This is sort of an acquired art. Cut the bus wire
     about 6" long. Next bend the wire at 90 degrees at the 5" mark you now
     have an L that is 1" on the bottom and 5" on the stem. Hold the stem and
     solder the bottom to the PCB on top of your excessively soldered crack.
     Now just clip the stem off. You should now have a crack that is bridged
     by a soldered on wire which will give your cracked board the added
     strength that it needs. If there are near-by traces you should also
     check these for possible hairline cracks or the starts of some. On
     boards with high trace density this method may not be possible; in that
     case use small gauge (#30) Kynar covered wirewrap wire and solder it to
     the associated trace pads on opposite sides of the crack.

  5. Some connections won't take the solder very easily. In that case remove
     all the old solder with either wick or a solder sucker. Pre-tin the
     connector until it excepts the solder readily and then solder the
     connector and it's pad. If you don't do this you will end up with a cold
     solder joint underneath your new solder.

  6. If you are a person that is for some reason or other always moving or
     unplugging your monitor; go out and buy yourself an extension for your
     monitor signal plug. Hook the monitor signal plug to the extender and
     then use the male end of the extension plug as your signal plug. If you
     bend one of these pins it will be a lot cheaper then having to buy a
     signal plug for your monitor if you can find one.

  7. In some VGA monitors you may have video smearing with dark letters on a
     light background. This maybe caused from some low value electrolytics
     (usually around 1 uf) that have gone bad in the video driver circuits.
     Usually you can check these in circuit with an oscilloscope or out of
     circuit with a capacitance checker.

  8. Other filament problems might be low voltage caused from a leaky filter
     capacitor in the filament circuit. The capacitor will dropped the
     filament voltage down. A resistor can increase in value causing the
     filament current to drop off. Both of these problems can give you a
     faded picture look. A filter capacitor that has opened up will give you
     a bright picture full of noise and that is high to trace especially if
     your looking for it in the video.

  9. Homemade degaussing coils can be made using three degaussing coils (out
     of junked monitors) in series that way you do not need a ballast load
     and it acts more like the heavy duty degaussering coils. They still get
     warm though.

 10. When checking a focus control the main thing to look for here is that
     the best focus is not on one end of the control. If it is then your
     focus control block is bad or falling out of tolerance.

 11. High voltage regulation circuits can give you some weird problems. One
     particular monitor would shut down when it went from high white screen
     to a black screen. High voltage will elevate when the screen is darker
     and sometimes exceed the high voltage safety limit activating the shut
     down circuit.

 12. Changing out CRT's is more of an art that gets better with practice.
     Some color CRT's line right up with a new tube and some take over four
     hours experimenting with results that still do not fall within specs.

 13. Capacitors in the primary of the SMPS may go bad and cause the shape of
     the switching pulse to be distorted; the SMPS becomes inefficient and
     causing over heating and lower voltage. Change the capacitors if they
     look bad; shrinking of the vinyl casing or leakage underneath (looks
     like a leaky battery in a radio). Capacitors with 105 degree temperature
     ratings are recommended in power supplies instead of 85 degree types
     because of the self generated heat. Everything in the power supply is a
     suspect of failure. SMPS transformers can even fail although it is rare.
     Some produce a high audio frequency whine at times due to material
     oscillations and load conditions.

 14. Metal film resistors can cause weird shut down and start up problems.
     These are usually found in the power supply over current sense circuits.
     These resistors check good cold but fail after applying heat to them.
     When cool they would seem to run all day but if heat is applied they
     fail faster. The value of these resistors would fall between 100k and
     500k usually.

@node 13.24 "Monitor service and how to get some"

A typical monitor warranty is something like: 2 years parts, 1 year parts and
labor (i.e. you have to pay for labor the last year of your warranty). What
should you do when you are totally unsatisfied with warranty service or when
your monitor blows up 1 day after the warranty expires.

(From material provided by a former head service guy for a major computer
sales/service company.)

The behind the scenes secrets to get what you want are to do one or a
multiple of the following:

  1. Call the "Service" (it appears they really aren't) Department of the
     company you procured the monitor from, and kindly ask to speak with the
     Service Manager. If they ask for your name, they will most likely pass
     it on, as well as your service history... The manager will be "not at
     his desk". They will ask to take a message... say something like "I
     would like to discuss a service contract" (free money) or "I would like
     to speak to him about your firm's good service" (appeal to his ego).
     These are positive things they like. They person on the phone will get
     your # and you will hear back within maybe an hour or so. Reason:
     Service people like myself live in a very, VERY negative world... in the
     back of our minds we like to hear good and hide from the every day bad.
     He will call back thinking good and when you get him, you can either
     beat him up, or butter him up... depending on your personality or style.
     The later is best. The nicer you are to someone, the more they will do
     for you... treat him like you've known him for years... talk to him on a
     one on one type style... tell him what has happened in a very calm,
     relaxed mood... sit back and relax... imagine yourself as Jack
     Nicolson.(?) Talk as long as you can... joke, talk about golf,
     whatever... The longer you are on the phone with him, the more likely he
     is to do something.

  2. Hardball! Tell'em your going to call the Attorney General and get this
     monitor covered under the Lemon law in your state if they don't get it
     fixed NOW! They will have to give you a new monitor if the machine has
     to be fixed under warranty more than 3-times in a 1-year period.

  3. Call the manufacturer. Tell them your monitor is bad and that the
     company that sold you the monitor has sent it to for service multiple
     times and that you must have it fixed because it monitors a dialysis
     machine for a 5-month old baby with liver cancer and a broken leg or
     something like that... Pull their strings. Kindly let them know you
     aren't pleased with the monitor and you would like to send it in
     personally... (yes! you can do this!) The key acronyms are RMA# or RA#
     or MRA#.... they all refer to Return Merchandise Authorization number in
     some form.

  4. (This one is from sam) Threaten to plaster their miserable product name
     all over the Internet. Note that I do not believe one should actually do
     this - posting whiney messages to a bunch of newsgroups is largely
     non-productive and may leave you open to legal repercussions. But, the
     threat will need to be taken increasing seriously as the importance of
     Internet as an international medium expands exponentially.

When you send it the monitor, the RMA# has to be on the box. Call the
manufacturer at their 800 number. Ask for Customer Service. Tell them the
story (kindly) and say that you would like to get an RMA#. This is a type of
laundry ticket # they give you to track the monitor's progress... and they
report directly to you when you call the RMA department to check on it's
status. If they won't do this for an individual person, ask for an address of
an Authorized Repair Depot. You will have to call the repair depot and get an
RMA#.

Let them know you would like to deal with them directly. I would use tip (3)
as a last resort, (just before I call the Attorney General).

I would also be careful of the game they may be playing: let the warranty on
labor run over so we can get some money.

@node 14.1 "Advanced monitor troubleshooting"

If the solutions to your problems have not been covered in this document, you
still have some options other than surrendering your monitor to the local
service center or the dumpster.

(Also see the related document: "Sources of Repair Information and General
Comments".)

Manufacturer's service literature: Service manuals may be available for for
your monitor. Once you have exhausted other obvious possibilities, the cost
may be well worth it. Depending on the type of equipment, these can range in
price from $10-150 or more. Some are more useful than others. However, not
all include the schematics so if you are hoping to repair an electronic
problem try to check before buying.

Inside cover of the equipment: TVs often have some kind of circuit diagram
pasted inside the back cover. In the old days, this was a complete schematic.
Now, if one exists at all for a monitor, it just shows part numbers and
location for key components - still very useful.

SAMs Photofacts: These have been published for over 45 years but have never
been common for monitors. There are a few for some early PC monitors but for
anything modern, forget it.

Whatever the ultimate outcome, you will have learned a great deal. Have fun -
don't think of this as a chore. Electronic troubleshooting represents a
detective's challenge of the type hat Sherlock Holmes could not have
resisted.  You at least have the advantage that the electronics do not lie or
attempt to deceive you (though you may beg to differ at times). So, what are
you waiting for?

TVs as I recall for old tube sets. Here are is one suggestion which you may
find (or its predecessor) at your local public library (621.384 if you

@node 14.4 "Parts information"

I have found one of the most useful single sources for general information on
semiconductors to be the ECG Semiconductors Master Replacement Guide, about
$6 from your local Philips distributor. STK, NTE, and others have similar
manuals. The ECG manual will enable you to look up U.S., foreign, and
manufacturer 'house' numbers and identify device type, pinout, and other
information. Note that I am not necessarily recommending using ECG (or other
generic) replacements if the original replacements are (1) readily available
and (2) reasonably priced. However, the cross reference can save countless
hours searching through databooks or contacting the manufacturers. Even if
you have a wall of databooks, this source is invaluable. A couple of caveats:
(1) ECG crosses have been known to be incorrect - the specifications of the
ECG replacement part were inferior to the original. (2) Don't assume that the
specifications provided for the ECG part are identical to the original - they
may be better in some ways. Thus, using the ECG to determine the
specifications of the parts in your junk bin can be risky.

Other cross reference guides are available from the parts source listed
below.

@node 14.5 "Information sources on the Internet"

Many manufacturers are now providing extensive information via the World Wide
Web. The answer to you question may be a mouse click away. Perform a net
search or just try to guess the manufacturer's home page address. The most
obvious is often correct. It will usually be of the form "http://www.xxx.com"
where xxx is the manufacturers' name, abbreviation, or acronym. For example,
Hewlett Packard is hp, Sun Microsystems is sun, Western Digital Corp. is wdc.
NEC is, you guessed it, nec. It is amazing what is appearing freely
accessible via the WWW. For example, monitor manufacturers often have
complete information including detailed specifications for all current and
older products. Electronic parts manufacturers often have detailed datasheets
for their product offerings.

@node 14.6 "Interchangeability of components"

Q: If I cannot obtain an exact replacement or if I have a monitor, TV, or
other equipment carcass gathering dust, can I substitute a part that is not a
precise match? Sometimes, this is simply desired to confirm a diagnosis and
avoid the risk of ordering an expensive replacement and/or having to wait
until it arrives.

For safety related items, the answer is generally NO - an exact replacement
part is needed to maintain the specifications within acceptable limits with
respect to line isolation, X-ray protection and to minimize fire hazards.
Typical parts of this type include flameproof resistors, some types of
capacitors, and specific parts dealing with CRT high voltage regulation.
However, during testing, it is usually acceptable to substitute electrically
equivalent parts on a temporary basis. For example, an ordinary 1 ohm
resistor can be substituted for an open 1 ohm flameproof resistor to
determine if there are other problems in the horizontal deflection circuits
before placing an order - as long as you don't get lazy and neglect to
install the proper type before buttoning up the monitor or TV.

For other components, whether a not quite identical substitute will work
reliably or at all depends on many factors. Some deflection circuits are so
carefully matched to a specific horizontal output transistor that no
substitute will be reliable.

Here are some guidelines:

  1. Fuses - exact same current rating and at least equal voltage rating. I
     have often soldered a normal 3AG size fuse onto a smaller blown 20 mm
     long fuse as a substitute.

  2. Resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, switches, potentiometers,
     LEDs, and other common parts - except for those specifically marked as
     safety-critical - substitution as long as the replacement part fits and
     specifications should be fine. It is best to use the same type - metal
     film resistor, for example. But for testing, even this is not a hard and
     fast rule and a carbon resistor should work just fine.

  3. Rectifiers - many are of these are high efficiency and/or fast recovery
     types. Replacements should have at equal or better PRV, Imax, and Tr
     specifications.

  4. Transistors and thyristors (except HOTs and SMPS choppers) - substitutes
     will generally work as long as their specifications meet or exceed those
     of the original. For testing, it is usually ok to use types that do not
     quite meet all of these as long as the breakdown voltage and maximum
     current specifications are not exceeded. However, performance may not be
     quite as good. For power types, make sure to use a heatsink.

  5. Horizontal output (or SMPS) transistors - exact replacement is generally
     best but except for very high performance monitors, generic HOTs that
     have specifications that are at least as good will work in many cases.
     Make sure the replacement transistor has an internal damper diode if the
     original had one. For testing with a series light bulb, even a
     transistor that doesn't quite meet specifications should work well
     enough (and not blow up) to enable you to determine what else may be
     faulty. The most critical parameters are Vceo/Vcbo, Ic, and Hfe which
     should all be at least equal to the original transistor. I have often
     used by favorite BU208D as a temporary substitute for other HOTs and
     SMPS (chopper) transistors. Make sure you use a heatsink (with
     insulating washer if applicable) and thermal grease in any case - even
     if you have to hang the assembly with a cable-tie to make it fit.

  6. Deflection yokes - in the old days, particularly for TVs, all of these
     were quite similar. It was common to just swap with one that fit
     physically and at most need to adjust or change a width coil. With high
     performance multiscan monitors, this is no longer the case. Sometimes it
     will work but other times the power supply won't even be able to come up
     as a result of the impedance mismatch due different coils and pole piece
     configurations. In addition, there may be other geometry correction
     coils associated with the yoke that could differ substantially.

  7. CRTs - aside from the issues of physical size and mounting, many factors
     need to be considered. These include deflection angle, neck diameter,
     base pinout, focus and screen voltage requirements, purity and
     convergence magnets, etc. Color CRT replacement is rarely worth the
     effort in any case but trying to substitute a different CRT is asking
     for frustration. For monochrome CRTs, there is less variation and this
     may be worth a try.

The following are usually custom parts and substitution of something from
your junk box is unlikely to be successful even for testing: flyback (LOPT)
and SMPS transformers, interstage coils or transformers, microcontrollers,
and other custom programmed chips.

Substituting mainboards and other modules from identical models is, of
course, possible but some realignment may be needed. Even a monitor from the
same manufacturer that is not quite identical may use the same subsystems,
perhaps depopulated or jumpered differently.
