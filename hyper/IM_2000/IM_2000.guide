 Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
 He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
 Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
 The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

 You watch the world exploding every single night
 Dancing in the sun a new born in the light
 Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
 Hello to eternity and live for every breath

 Your time will come
 Your time will come (2x)

 The ferryman wants his money you ain't going to give it back
 He can push his own boat as you set up off the track
 Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
 Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

 You watch the world exploding every single night
 Dancing in the sun, a new born in the light
 Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
 The shadow of the Wicker man is rising up again

 Your time will come
 Your time will come (2x)

 Your time will come ... (8x)

 I have sailed to many lands now I make my final journey
 On the bow I stand, west is where I go
 Through the night I plough still my heart, calculate and pray
 As the compass swings my will is strong
 I will not be led astray
 Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
 But I know, but I know, but I know

 I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
 As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
 As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
 The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

 Take my heart and set it free
 Carried forward by the waves
 Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son

 Chasing Rainbows all my days
 Where I go I do not know
 I only know the place I've been
 Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
 Nothing's real until you feel

 I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
 Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
 I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
 For eternity I follow on there is no other way
 The mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
 But I know, I know

 I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
 As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
 As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
 The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

 Take my heart and set it free
 Carried forward by the waves
 Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son

 Chasing Rainbows all my days
 Where I go I do not know
 I only know the place I've been
 Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
 Nothing's real until you feel

 Lost my love, lost my life

 Mother love is no more

 And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
 What do you think you'd expect you would see?
 Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
 And in the river reflections of me

 Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
 And in a movement he beckons to me
 And in a moment the memories are all that remain
 And all the wounds are opening again

 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers
 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers

 And as you look all around at the world in dismay
 What do you see, do you think we have learned
 Not if you're taking a look at the war torn affray
 Out in the streets where the babies are burned

 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers
 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers

 There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
 There are times I'm ashamed of us all
 When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
 And reflecting the good and the bad

 Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
 Can you really tell me what life is?
 Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
 Could be swept away by fate's own hand

 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers
 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers

 [solo]

 When you think that we've used all our chances
 And the chance to make everything right,
 Keep on making the same old mistakes
 Makes untipping the balance so easy
 When we're living our lives on the edge
 Say a prayer on the book of the dead

 [solo]

 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers
 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers

 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers
 We're blood brothers,
 we're blood brothers

 And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life

 Diablo come again
 To make trophies out of men

 Lose your skin, lose your skull
 One by one the sack is full
 In the heat dehydrate
 Know which breath will be your last

 Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
 You've got to kill to stay alive
 Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
 You've got to kill to stay alive

 Show them no fear, show them no pain
 Show them no fear, show them no pain
 Show them no fear, show them no pain

 Human heart, human mind
 Intellect intertwined
 Focus sharp in the night
 Watch the jungle burning bright

 Toe to toe throw the line
 Everyone's caught hand tied
 Iron will Iron fist
 How could it have come to this?

 Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
 You've got to kill to stay alive
 Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

 Have you ever felt
 The future is the past
 But you don't know how ...?
 A reflected dream
 Of a captured time
 Is it really now, is it really happening?

 Don't know why I feel this way
 Have I dreamt this time, this place?
 Something vivid comes again into my mind
 And I think I've seen your face
 Seen this room, been in this place
 Something vivid comes again into my mind

 All my hopes and expectation
 Looking for an explanation
 Have I found my destination?
 I just can't take no more

 The dream is true, the dream is true
 The dream is true, the dream is true

 Think I've heard your voice before
 Think I've said these words before
 Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
 Am I still inside my dream?
 Is this a new reality
 Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

 All my hopes and expectation
 Looking for an explanation
 Coming to the realisation
 That I can't see for sure

 I only dream in Black and White
 I only dream 'cause I am alive
 I only dream in Black and White
 To save me from myself

 I only dream in Black and White
 I only dream 'cause I'm alive
 I only dream in Black and White
 Please save me from myself

 The dream is true, the dream is true
 The dream is true, the dream is true

 I get up put on the light
 Dreading the oncoming night
 Scared to fall asleep and dream
 the dream again

 Nothing that I contemplate
 Nothing that I can compare
 To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

 Dread to think what might be stirring
 That my dream is reoccurring
 Got to keep away from drifting
 Saving me from myself

 I only dream in Black and White
 I only dream 'cause I'm alive
 I only dream in Black and White
 To save me from myself

 I only dream in Black and White
 I only dream 'cause I'm alive
 I only dream in Black and White
 To save me from myself

 Lost in a dream of mirrors
 Lost in a paradox
 Lost and time is spinning
 Lost a nightmare I retrace

 Lost a hell that I revisit
 Lost another time and place
 Lost a parallel existence
 Lost a nightmare I retrace

 I only dream in Black and White
 I only dream 'cause I'm alive
 I only dream in Black and White
 To save me from myself

 I only dream in Black and White
 I only dream 'cause I'm alive
 I only dream in Black and White
 To save me from myself

 And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
 As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way

 Like a vision floating with the desert winds
 Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
 You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands

 Nomad rider of the ancient east
 Nomad rider that men know the least
 Nomad where you come from no one knows
 Nomad where you go to no one tells

 Undercover of the veil of your disguise
 The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
 No one's certain what your future will behold
 You're a legend your own story will be told

 Nomad rider of the ancient east
 Nomad rider that men know the least
 Nomad where you come from no one knows
 Nomad where you go to no one tells

 No ones dares to even look or glance your way
 Your reputation goes before you they all say
 Like a spirit that can disappear at will
 Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill

 Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
 Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
 Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
 No man's ever understood your genius

 Those who fear your reputation hide or run
 You send before you a mystique that's all your own

 Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
 No man ever understood your genius

 Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
 But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
 Some they say that you have killed a hundred men
 Others say that you have died and live again

 Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
 Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
 Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands

 Separate lives no more disguise, no more second chances

 When a person turns to wrong
 Is it a want to be, belong?
 Part of things at any cost
 At what price a life is lost

 At what point do we begin
 Fighter spirit a will to win
 But what makes a man decide
 Take the wrong or righteous road

 There's a thin line between love and hate
 Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
 There's a grey place between black and white
 But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

 We all like to put the blame
 On society these things
 But what kind of good or bad
 A new generation brings

 Sometimes takes just more than that
 To survive be good at heart
 There is evil in some of us
 No matter what will never change

 I will hope
 My soul will fly
 So I will live forever
 Heart will die
 My soul will fly
 And I will live forever

 [solo]

 Just a few small tears between
 Someone happy and one sad
 Just a thin line drawn between
 Being a genius or insane

 At what age begin to learn
 Of which way out we will turn
 There's a long and winding road
 And the trail is there to burn

 There's a thin line between love and hate
 Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
 There's a grey place between black and white
 But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

 [solo]

 I will hope
 My soul will fly
 So I will live forever
 Heart will die
 My soul will fly
 And I will live forever (2x)

 [solo]

 The thin line between love and hate

@{b} IRON MAIDEN - THE OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY (10/02/99)@{ub}

 In 1999, Iron Maiden is a household-name in every part of the world.
 After 20 years and almost 50 million album sales, Maiden is now rightly
 regarded as the 'classic' rock band in every sense: modern masters of
 that most emotionally extreme and technically dazzling form of rock music
 - the black sheep they call heavy metal. A genre Maiden single-handedly
 reinvented for the Eighties, when they released their first single,
 the punk-metal collision, 'Running Free', and their uncompromisingly
 raw debut album, 'Iron Maiden', in 1980. And a genre which is once again
 currently enjoying a vast renaissance worldwide with Maiden very much
 involved as always.

 Back in the early eighties, Maiden was the band at the forefront of the
 New Wave Of British Heavy Metal - a short-lived media-led phenomenon that
 would propel them onto the world stage. "People always used to call us
 punk-metal when we first started getting reviewed in the music papers in
 Britain," bassist and founding member, Steve Harris, recalls with a rueful
 smile. "But I think that was partly to do with the fact that our singer
 then, Paul Di'Anno, had quite short hair and the fact that we used to
 play so fast. We used to come across as really aggressive. But that was
 never really a punk thing to me - that was a pure metal thing. We used
 to frighten the life out of the punks·"

 Despite receiving no radio play whatsoever, 'Running Free' their debut
 single leapt into the UK Top 40. When the band were then offered their
 first appearance on Top Of The Pops, the UK's biggest weekly TV chart
 show, Maiden refused to do it unless they were allowed to play live
 - something no artist had done on Top Of The Pops since The Who
 demolished the studio during a performance of their 'Quadrophenia'
 hit, '5.15', in 1972. The BBC execs were sceptical but eventually
 relented and such precocity was rewarded when their debut album,
 'Iron Maiden', was released a few weeks later and immediately crashed
 into the UK albums chart at No.4!

 It was this take-no-prisoners attitude the band started with, and still
 adopt to this day, which has served them so well throughout their career.
 Since then, every one of the 11 studio albums and three live albums that
 Maiden have released have been major Top 10 successes both at home in
 the UK and more than 25 other countries around the world, including over
 20 hit singles - a fact that sometimes gets overlooked as so few of them
 have ever been played on radio - and no less than five consecutive
 million-selling albums in America.

 Along the way, despite numerous line-up changes the quintessential
 Maiden sound - the rumbling-earth bass, searchlight guitars, spatter-gun
 drums and lion's roar vocals - remained mercifully undimmed throughout.
 Their second album "Killers" followed in 1981 which saw the band paying
 first time tour visits to America, Canada and Japan. The album achieved
 the band gold album status around the world but at the end of the tour
 singer Paul Di Anno left heralding the arrival of Bruce Dickinson.

 1982 was to exceed all expectations for the new line up. After a couple
 of warm up shows with Bruce the band went in to record the legendary
 "Number of The Beast" album. This blew away all competition to enter
 the UK Chart at No.1 while the classic Maiden track, "Run To The Hills",
 got the band their first UK Top 10 single. This success was mirrored
 across Europe and also the American charts. The gruelling 180 date,
 8 month 'Beast on The Road Tour' again broke new ground for the band
 as they did shows in Australia and New Zealand and saw the band headline
 their first sold out US Show at the New York Palladium proving a portent
 of things to come. Once again there was a band casualty with Clive Burr,
 the bands drummer, leaving to make way for the now infamous drummer/
 prankster/headcase Nicko McBrain.

 The band immediately started work on Piece Of Mind which they recorded
 in Nassau in the Bahamas. The album went in the UK charts at No.3 when
 the band started their "World Piece Tour" in the UK. As before there
 was to be no let up in pace and Maiden found themselves playing to larger
 and larger audiences selling out everywhere and gathering more momentum
 in America with their first - of many - full scale arena headline tour.
 Powerslave was recorded in Nassau in 1985. The "Slavery Tour" was to give
 fans a massive stageshow of lights and production featuring Eddie, the
 bands hugely popular mascot and icon, now being transformed from a walk
 on part to a huge twenty foot mechanised monster. The groundbreaking tour
 started behind the Iron Curtain in Poland which was the first time a major
 band had taken full western production behind the Iron Curtain. By the
 third week of the tour the album itself was released, going straight in
 the UK Album Charts at No.2.

 The band found themselves breaking records everywhere playing the Rock
 In Rio Festival to 200,000 fans, selling out Radio City Hall in New York
 five nights running (illness preventing it from reaching seven) and the
 first act ever to sell out Long Beach Arena (Capacity 13000) for 4
 consecutive nights. This Long Beach success was captured in the bands
 next release "Live After Death", Maidens first Double Live album and
 video of the same name. The Live album charted at No.2 and the video
 went to No.1 in the video charts and remained there for some time.
 These releases are still regarded by many as one of the best live
 albums/videos of all time.

 "Somewhere in Time" was released in September 1986, this time recorded
 in both Nassau and Munich. This album marked a slight change in their
 style with the inclusion of keyboards for the first time but in no way
 diluted Maidens classic style. The first single released off the album
 "Wasted Years" reached the UK top twenty and was a track written about
 the rigours of their previous tours. The album continued to go gold or
 platinum in practically every major territory. The live show as before
 was a dazzling spectacle. The highlight featured Eddie, this time an
 understage inflatable and portrayed as a cyborg from the cover artwork,
 lifting the band off the stage with his two hands and sending Nicko and
 drumkit skywards balanced on his head. "Somewhere On Tour" again started
 in Eastern Europe and included six sell out nights at the Hammersmith
 Odeon before again spending the spring of 1987 touring through the US
 and finishing in Japan some eight months later.

 1988 brought "Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son", Maidens' first and only
 concept album. This wasn't the original idea at the outset, but in
 writing and followed by rehearsals it seemed the material had a common
 theme running through out. The first single "Can I Play With Madness"
 went to No.3 in the UK Charts and was followed by 3 other singles from
 the album all reaching the Top 10 - quite a feat without Radio support.
 The "Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour" saw them begin in the US. The high
 spot of the tour was to be the headlining of the legendary "Monsters Of
 Rock Festival" at Castle Donington which with support by the likes of
 Kiss, Dave Lee Roth, Guns and Roses and stablemates Helloween, they
 played to a all time record breaking 107,000 fans. The "Monsters"
 festival also had repeated success in Europe after which the band
 continued back to the UK to complete the tour with sell out shows at
 Wembley Arena for 2 nights, the Birmingham NEC 2 nights and 4 nights
 at the Hammersmith Odeon.

 The band had previously decided to take the whole of 1989 off however,
 unable to rest, Bruce and Adrian spent their time recording their first
 solo albums and November 1989 saw the group team up again for the launch
 of the "Maiden England" video. In January 1990 work had barely begun on
 the "No Prayer For The Dying" album when Adrian decided to leave the band,
 this being their first personnel change for some seven years. Bruce
 meanwhile had been working through the previous summer with ex-Gillan
 and White Spirit guitarist, Janick Gers who after auditioning was invited
 to join.
 
 The new line-up recorded the album in the UK at Steve's own Barnyard
 studio. Released October 1st the album entered the UK Chart at No.2.
 This album was to finally bring the band their first elusive No.1
 single with "Bring Your Daughter to The Slaughter" going straight
 to No.1 for Christmas 1990.

 Work on "Fear on The Dark" started early in 1992 and Eddie went through
 a transformation as for the first time artist Derek Riggs did not supply
 the cover art but instead the band took a more sinister image drawn by
 Melvin Grant. "Fear Of The Dark" was to be the bands third No.1 album
 and with an elaborate show the band hit the road again starting this
 time in Scandanavia. Again the opportunity to play Castle Donington
 came to the band. The show was filmed and later released on video while
 several other shows on the tour were being recorded for a possible live
 album. Finishing in Japan in November the band returned unaware of what
 was lurking around the corner.

 In March 1993 Bruce announced his departure feeling he had got to
 saturation point with other projects and the band set to work on
 finding a replacement while doing a final "Real Live Tour" tour with
 Bruce. The band visited Moscow for the first time and received an
 amazing reception and went on to complete 44 shows across Europe.
 Bruces final show was to be a live pay-per-view televised spectacular
 "Raising Hell" featuring the magician Simon Drake performing grisly
 tricks interspersed with live performance by the band. This included
 Simon playing a guitar solo with guitarist Dave Murray severed hands
 and Bruce being decapitated!

 After an intensive search Blaze Bayley of Wolfsbane was announced as
 Maidens new vocalist. The band and Blaze had already crossed paths as
 Wolfsbane had supported Maiden on 1990 UK Tour. This new partnership
 started work on the darkly smouldering "X Factor" album, again recorded
 at Steve's Barnyard Studios but with Steve himself co-producing it with
 Nigel Green. The X Factour started prior to the album launch in October
 1995 with shows in new territories Israel and South Africa. The album
 itself went to No.8 in the album chart while the band continued to tour
 comprehensively in Europe and the UK, highlighted with the bands Brixton
 Academy show before they continued throughout Western Europe, America,
 Japan and headlining many major festivals including the "Monsters of Rock"
 in Sao Paulo to 50,000 fans.

 1997 saw work start on Virtual XI, aptly named, this being their Eleventh
 Studio album. The cover artwork supplied by Melvin Grant depicted a boy
 watching a football match through a Virtual Reality headset while being
 surrounded by Armageddon and Eddie. This being a comment on technology
 taking over everything and the concern society shares as we approach the
 Millennium. This sentiment was also reflected in the material on the album
 with tracks such as "Futureal" and "When Two Worlds Collide". The football
 theme was carried through as Maiden, always being massive football
 supporters, decided to promote the album launch with their own Football
 tour, 1998 being World Cup year. The band set to work on putting together
 a dream team of world professionals such as Paul Gascoigne, Ian Wright,
 Faustino Asprilla, Marc Overmars, Patrik Viera and Stuart Pearce, Stuart
 being an immense Maiden fan. A Virtual XI team which featured ex-England
 stalwarts Terry Butcher, Tony Woodcock, Neil Webb and Paul Mariner toured
 throughout Europe playing games against teams with similarly famous names
 like Anders Limpar in Sweden, Gentile and Altobelli in Italy and even
 meeting up with the great Eusebio in Portugal.

 The first single "The Angel and The Gambler" featured an amazing video,
 seeing the band placed in a completely computer generated environment
 depicting Eddie in his new guise along with characters that appear in
 "Ed Hunter", the forthcoming computer game. Their successful nine month
 "Virtual World Tour" saw them in Europe, Japan, North America and finally
 South America.

 And so to now ...... January 1999.

 With the departure of Blaze Bayley, the return of both Bruce Dickinson
 and Adrian Smith brings a new twist to the Maiden tale. Now a six piece
 with a formidable three guitar onslaught, plans are currently taking
 shape for a Spring release of "Ed Hunter", touring in July/August/Sept.,
 recording a studio album at the end of the year and a full World Tour
 in 2000.

 Metal is currently enjoying a World wide resurgence in popularity and
 Maiden will once again be in the vanguard. And that's where they intend
 to stay for many more years to come.

@{b} INTENSE PERCEPTIONS@{ub} ... Part 1 (10.04.2000)

 An interview with Iron Maiden bassist Steve Harris about the new album,
 single and tour.

 The album is just finished. The band have been really pushing to get the
 album finished on time and are now ecstatic that not only is it finished
 but they class it as one of the best they have EVER done. After a weeks
 break, they will jump on the Rock'n'Roll merry-go-round that is called
 "Promotion". They will travel in pairs to far off countries to talk about
 the album and the tour that is coming. Once they have returned from that
 they will get together again to discuss the tour, singles, artwork...
 in fact a whole plethora of matters that will ensure that you, the fan,
 get the best album and tour Maiden can provide. Then they move into
 rehearsals and before they know it ... the tour begins!

 There is no better time to grab bassist Steve Harris and fire a few well
 chosen questions at him about the album, tour and anything else that comes
 to mind. He was more than happy to oblige and gave a very open and frank
 insight into the thinking behind "BRAVE NEW WORLD" and the forthcoming
 METAL 2000 tour.


@{b} JOHNNY B: You've gone into writing an album so soon after finishing
 a tour, you were obviously up for it. Was it the fact that you had
 a new line up and you wanted to get into the studio and get on with it?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Oh that was part of the process of getting prepared to go
 into recording. One or two weeks into the tour we knew we would go in and
 be fresh off the tour. It was only a short tour obviously, the shortest
 tour we've ever done."


@{b} JOHNNY B: It was a good tour though.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah, It was a great vibe playing together again and
 the crowds seemed to love it."


@{b} JOHNNY B: And you were all up for recording?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah. It was just getting the vibe getting together again
 and playing together again. We just thought we'd go straight in fresh
 off the tour and do a new album. We could just gone in and done an album
 but we thought it best to go and do some shows first. There was the
 Ed Hunter PC game to tour with as well. We did a completely different
 sort of show for that than obviously we will do for the next tour.
 Basically we wanted to go in the studio and add all the vibes, all the
 freshness of coming off a tour and playing together again."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Did you find this album any harder of easier than previous
           albums?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Well ... this album we approached differently and we
 actually rehearsed for quite a while before going in and doing it.
 Normally we just go in and do it and rehearse the songs in the studio
 and we would allocate ourselves a specific period of time before that
 when we write the songs. This time however we had a sort of on and off
 period, a sort of longer period to write. We were writing bits and pieces
 here and there, then going in to finish off the writing then basically
 rehearsing the songs at the end. Normally we just rehearse a song and
 then just do it as we're going along. It's just a different way of
 approaching it when we're recording at my studio, at home, as we haven't
 got a time problem there. It's a totally different approach. The recording
 and the rehearsals are all one and in the same place. Whereas you can't
 really go and start spending the same sort of money it would cost for the
 recording to just rehearse. It's just insane to rehearse for a month in
 a recording studio that is costing ... whatever a day it's just stupid.
 So it just has to be a different approach. So we rehearsed the new stuff
 in a rehearsal room rather than in a recording studio. We rehearsed the
 stuff really well first so that when we went in to do the backing tracks
 they went down obviously a lot quicker. We'd rehearsed the songs as if
 we were going to play live."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Did you like that way of working?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Well yeah. We've done it that way before years ago and
 we enjoyed it and it worked. Either way really it works because the end
 result is the same in the sense that you just want to get the best
 performance down. It is just two different ways of doing it basically.
 I mean either way I like doing it, it doesn't matter one way or the other
 really."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Why did you choose Belgium for your writing?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Well ... Dick Bell (Maiden Production Manager) found
 the place and it's just a really good place. It's just a great place to
 rehearse, the people are nice and the whole atmosphere was relaxed and
 friendly."


@{b} JOHNNY B: What makes it a good place to rehearse?
           Why was that such a great place?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Simple ... because it was just a really good size and
 sound. For me it was just a good vibe there. Like I said, the people were
 friendly and stuff like that and that means a lot. The facilities were
 good and relaxed. You could just relax and nobody knew where we were.
 We weren't getting hassled by anybody and we could just go there, do
 a job and get on with it basically. Conversely that's also what's good
 when we rehearse at my place. I know nobody will bother us there. I know
 it was kinda out the way but it's good. Yeah it was a great place."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Did you have to completely change your recording technique,
           seeing as how you've got three leading guitarists this time?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Well to be honest with you that's a kind of difficult
 question to answer because we were using a new guy. I mean we were using
 a different producer, Kevin Shirley. So I don't know if we would've
 approached it in the same way using three guitarists as two. Obviously,
 you have to approach it slightly differently for mixing the stuff but
 as to whether he would recorded it the same with two guitar players,
 I don't really know. I haven't worked with him before but I don't think
 it probably would have been. After having worked with him, he's just
 a straight head sort of bloke and he just goes in and gets on with it.
 I don't think he would of done things much differently."


@{b} JOHNNY B: How was it working with Kevin Shirley?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah, it was great. I mean it was really great working
 with him. I was a little worried about working with a different person
 you don't know. I always would be because you don't know what they're
 going to be like. Obviously, you know what they've done work-wise and
 their reputation. We met him and he seemed like a nice guy. However until
 you get down to it you don't know if you're going to click with somebody
 or not ... but it clicked perfectly. It's just the way he works.
 It's very similar to the way we've been working the last two or three
 albums anyway, in a lot of ways, There were some things that he was doing
 that we hadn't been doing before but it was really good working like that.
 For instance we'd lay all the guitars down, the rhythm guitars, some over
 dub guitars and they would all go and record them altogether, rather than
 do them individually. This system worked out great. However, again
 I think that was because we were so well rehearsed we could do that.
 I think that if you weren't as well rehearsed and you'd just gone in
 and done them as we usually do them, by taking each song at a time,
 it may have been different. It is after all just a different approach
 but the fact that we had rehearsed for a month beforehand meant that
 we could just do things like that ... and easily. Everybody could just
 do their bits and it meant that we could just do it like that."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Does the producer influence an album in a way then?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "He influences the sound obviously of course, to a certain
 degree. If we were doing sounds that he didn't like he would say so.
 But yeah, he influences the sounds, the way you record, he's the engineer
 as well. He doesn't influence you in the writing of it. The right songs
 are already arranged and written beforehand anyway, so he doesn't
 influence you like that. He might have odd ideas, it's the same with
 other producers we've worked with like Martin Birch. It's the same type
 of thing ... they may have odd ideas but as to whether we used them or not
 is another thing. It depends as to whether you liked them or not. It's not
 a situation ... Well Maiden has never been the situation, where someone
 comes in and starts dictating what kind of sort of songs we write."


@{b} JOHNNY B: It is so important to get the right sort of person then?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah, it's important to get someone in that wants to get
 the right sort of performance out of you. You don't want someone that
 wants to just change the songs around. We knew that he wasn't that type
 of guy or we wouldn't have entertained him."


@{b} JOHNNY B: You knew that from his reputation?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Not really because he's capable of doing that if need be
 and I should imagine there are some band's that may need that approach.
 Some bands need that, or want that. We don't want that and he knew our
 reputation also. He knew that we wouldn't be wanting that and that's
 fine and it worked out great."


@{b} JOHNNY B: So would you work with Kevin Shirley again?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Oh definitely yeah. We really enjoyed working with him
 and we had good fun doing it."

@{b} INTENSE PERCEPTIONS@{ub} ... Part 2 (13.04.2000)


@{b} JOHNNY B: Yeah he seemed a good fun guy in the studio!@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah he is. When you're stuck in the studio for all that
 time together you need to have fun. What I mean is that I'm the one that's
 in the studio with him every day, day in and day out. I am there more so
 than the others so I need to get on with him. We got on really well
 together. It is so important to have a good working relationship.
 I imagine that there can't be anything worse than going into a studio if
 you don't like the person that you're working with. We were really lucky
 because we all got on really well with him and we would definitely work
 with him again."


@{b} JOHNNY B: After doing a couple of albums at Barnyard studios would it
           automatically have been a change to go anywhere else?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "We did Fear of the Dark, X Factor and Virtual 11 and we also
 did a bit of No Prayer there, although it wasn't properly in the studio,
 as we did it in the mobile studio. We also mixed a couple of live albums
 there as well. So we did quite a bit of stuff there and we just felt like
 it was time to go somewhere else really. It's the same as in the 80's when
 we did three albums in Compass Point in the Bahamas. We did the recording
 there and then went and mixed the stuff in New York, at Electric Lady
 studios. We did that for three albums and it felt good to go somewhere
 else. So we did some other stuff, like Somewhere In Time at Wisseloord
 Studios Holland. Who knows whether we'll go back to that one or somewhere
 else. I mean I really like the latest studio, the studio was great. Great
 environment to work in and really enjoyable. Professional people there.


@{b} JOHNNY B: Was it well equipped there?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah fantastic. Very well equipped. The people were really
 well on the button with professionalism and totally together. I was very
 impressed with the studio. I would work there again definitely. Whether
 we'll do that next time round who knows, that's not something we're
 thinking about yet. Whatever we decide now will probably change in a few
 weeks anyway ... such is the nature of the Beast."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Normally there's a good theme running through the album!@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "I am glad you asked this because it may clear up a few
 misconceptions before we get asked this on tour for the millionth time.
 Some people do think the albums are like concept albums when they are not.
 That's usually because of the artwork and the strong imagery that we use.
 What with the booklets and graphics and everything else and stuff like
 that. People get that impression. I say it with every album it's the way
 it is, it's a pretty simple approach and we try and get together the best
 collection of songs as best we can at any given time ... and you go with
 that. I mean you might look at it a year later and go back and think.
 Oh we could have done this or we could have done that'. You may think we
 could have second guessed this or that and we could have written a better
 song than that one. However at the time you're enthusiastic about your
 stuff and you think that's the best that you can come out with ... at that
 time ... you just HAVE to go with it. I don't think you should look back
 over your shoulder at all, that's always been our attitude. So that's
 something that's never changed in that respect. I mean that goes for with
 whatever the line up is, that's always been the attitude. I hope that
 clears it up. We write the best collection of songs we can at the time
 and everything else fits around them ... not the other way around."


@{b} JOHNNY B: So when you were working away from your own Barnyard studios,
           did you work on one song till it was finished or did you do
           a bit of each, seeing as you were now working to a time limit?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "With guitars and stuff as far as we could we were working
 on each track as we were going along, getting the sounds we needed.
 That's what made mixing easier because we were building a track up layer
 by layer, one at a time really. You just do bits and pieces what ever is
 needed and whoever is available at the time. You just get them in to do
 bits and pieces and that's how you carry on really. You get a working
 format going. You have to be very strict in your procedures as you only
 have limited time."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Do members of the band come in and say "Look I've got a cool
           riff, or do you want to hear this", or is it pretty well set
           before you go in?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Whatever work you need to do next ... you do it. You call
 them in and they do it. If they say they can't come in that day because
 of whatever but they can come in at the end of the week, or that they are
 absolutely itching to get in, then you just work it it like that.
 What I mean to say is that we've all been doing this a long time so it's
 not really a problem We just work it all out as you go along really.
 Some might say it's a bit disorganised but it's not really.


@{b} JOHNNY B: Organised chaos!@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah. Exactly."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Where did you come up with the name "Wicker Man" for the
           first single?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "I don't know if people reading have ever seen the film.
 It's a classic sort of British style of film. I like all British classics
 and British made films. It's got Christopher Lee in it and it's worth
 checking out, the scenes in that sum up the Wicker Man really. All that
 good pagan ritual stuff ... ho ho. Now I'm pigeon holing us!"


@{b} JOHNNY B: It was strong imagery in the Wicker Man, very eerie!@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah definitely, we've always liked a bit of imagery, a bit
 of light and shade in our songs and a bit of atmosphere. It conjures up
 all sorts of things in your mind and imagery carries it even further so."


@{b} JOHNNY B: What theme will you carry into the stage show?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "We're still deciding what we'll do with the stage show,
 we're talking about designs and stuff. To be honest at this point in time
 we haven't even got finished artwork so I wouldn't really want to comment
 completely on that.


@{b} JOHNNY B: Will it be a big theatrical show again?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah, a big show definitely. I hope it'll be one of the
 biggest. Again it's difficult to really talk about that too much without
 knowing what the artwork is. I mean we've seen some stuff but it's not
 finalised."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Can we go through the idea and concept behind each track?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "It's pretty boring!"


@{b} JOHNNY B: Well not really. It might be for you but not for the people
           reading this who don't know anything about the album yet.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "There's no concept really".


@{b} JOHNNY B: OK concepts the wrong word but there must be an idea behind
           the lyrics?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "No. You see the thing is when people ask you what the
 lyrics are, we get asked this question all the time and it's one of the
 most boring and difficult questions and you can quote me on that if you
 want to. You just write at the time whatever you're feeling at the time.
 You draw your influences from anything at the time, it could be films,
 books, history or circumstantial events, whatever. Or whatever you come
 up with out of your imagination at the time and that's what it is.
 You know, people kind of read into them all sorts of things. Sometimes
 they get it right, sometimes they don't. I think that's good that they
 have a bit of imagination. They are thinking what they perceive about
 the lyrics. It is great because the lyrics are obviously strong enough
 that they make them think. The fact that they're doing that and they have
 their own impression is a good thing. For me to exactly spell out what
 I was thinking (or whoever wrote those particular lyrics) at the time
 is wrong as far as we are concerned."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Is it pretty even the song writing, or was it just mainly
           you and Bruce?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Well you just have to look at the credits on the web and
 take it from that. Sometimes we just pair up or sometimes it was whoever
 was around at the time. Sometimes it was whoever was available for writing.
 Sometimes you think you might want to take a song in a certain direction
 with one person or another. Sometimes it's not even like that, it's whoever
 is up for doing stuff at that particular time you are working on that
 particular song. There's no big deal about it."

@{b} INTENSE PERCEPTIONS@{ub} ... Part 3 (18.04.2000)


@{b} JOHNNY B: The Wicker Man is a great song, it's fast!@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah, I think it's a really good single because we thought
 as soon as we wrote it that it could be a good single with a good catchy
 chorus, we've had a lot of really good catchy chorus's in the past as well
 but what do we really know about singles? We've released singles in the UK
 but they never really get played on the radio anywhere. Maybe we've been
 releasing the wrong songs as singles ... who knows! Even if we release
 the RIGHT kind of song, whatever THAT is, would it do anything anyway?
 I don't think so probably. I mean I don't think it really matters what
 we release as a single really. Sometimes I would just prefer to go the
 completely opposite way and release the bloody longest song on the album
 basically saying fuck you. I mean they wouldn't play it even if it was
 three, four, five minutes long so they're not going to play something that
 is eleven minutes long are they."


@{b} JOHNNY B: It is refreshing though that you are happy recording the songs
           the length they are rather than edit things down to a more
           "Radio Friendly" size.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "We never time anything ... in fact I asked you to time the
 album for me yesterday and that was the first time I had any idea of the
 full length of the tracks. None of us really pay any attention to the
 length of the songs. We never have done really."


@{b} JOHNNY B: That's excellent really don't you think?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah, I suppose! It is normally only after the event that
 people say can we do an edit on this ... or that. I don't have a problem
 doing an edit for a single if the song isn't a story from beginning to end,
 where chopping bits out will destroy the idea. Years ago the Americans
 asked us to edit "Hallowed". We told them to forget it because that would
 have just ruined it completely. On the other hand we did an edit on
 "Angel and the Gambler" because that was written on the album as a long
 version because it was written as it was, as if it was a "Live" version.
 What I mean by that is it was written as how we would do it with a crowd
 ... bringing it down quiet and getting the audience involved and stuff
 like that. So we could edit that and it wouldn't do the song any injustice
 at all. What I am trying to get across is that there are certain songs you
 can do that with and certain songs you cannot. You couldn't edit "Sign Of
 The Cross" for example, it would be ridiculous."


@{b} JOHNNY B: It's seems amazing then that some bands purposely change album
           songs so that they are shorter and more designed for singles.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah it's madness. That's because they think it's because
 they are gonna get played but they don't get played anyway. So they have
 probably spoilt a good album track by limiting themselves to a particular
 length of track and still they don't get played. I suppose that at the
 end of the day they think they are playing fair and that they are giving
 someone the chance, giving them the ammunition to go out there and do
 something. Otherwise, people turn around and say hey, we couldn't do
 anything with this track as you didn't give us the right length of song
 and all that crap. 

 It makes you then think ... okay this song could withstand an edit and it
 doesn't really matter if it is edited or not. It might actually be nice to
 have a different version on the single to the album anyway but ... only
 with certain songs. That's fine if the song can take it. We did it with
 "Angel and the Gambler" and stuff like that and I don't have a problem
 with that."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Do you think singles are still relevant to your album market?@{ub}
           (Steve pauses for quite a while and then answers,)

 STEVE HARRIS: "No, not really, I don't think they have ever been that
 relevant. I think their relevance is as a taster for the album, that's
 what they are and should be. A little teaser for the album that's all
 they have ever been for us. They have always done well in the UK as the
 fans go out and buy them and they get into the chart, well, hopefully
 anyway. They never stay there. We have never had a true hit single,
 in that sense, as they don't stay there long enough. However, we have
 never been that bothered about that kind of thing. We just release what
 song we thing will be the most viable one as a taster for the album.
 Whether that's of any use for anybody to go out and sell the thing as
 a single is another matter."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Obviously I have only just heard the album for the first time
           a short while ago but already I remember some of the tracks
           being very "Thematic" as in film theme tracks.
           They're great songs.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Thanks, but we have always done stuff like that really.
 There are songs that we have done in the past that could have been used
 on film soundtracks I think. I am really influenced by big epic film theme
 type music. I love that type of music."


@{b} JOHNNY B: I am specifically thinking of things like "Nomad"
           and "Blood Brothers" etc.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Certainly, Nomad is a fine example. It is a big "Lawrence
 of Arabia" type vibe. That is the sort of stuff I really like, the sort of
 stuff I get off on, film theme music. It is a big influence really. It
 always has been though, so it's not as if we have gone off in a different
 direction. That is the sort of thing people ALWAYS ask us when we start
 writing whether or not we are gonna go off in a different direction or
 not. We don't go off in any direction, we play what we feel. We don't try
 and be this or that or let trends dictate to us."

 People or bands who do that are just chasing their tails around half the
 time. You just cannot make an album worrying about what other people like.
 You have to like it yourself first. If they like what we have created all
 well and good. Thinking about it logically what else are you gonna do?
 Have a survey of fans and then write a song that sounds like so and so?
 Or decide to write a song that sounds like Number of the Beast 2 ...
 I don't think so! You can have the biggest survey in the world but it
 doesn't prove a thing. What's the point of having part two of anything
 anyway. A great song is a great song. A sequel won't make it any better".


@{b} JOHNNY B: Can I ask about "Ghost of The Navigator" which just blew me
           away on first hearing.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "You can but Bruce wrote the lyrics to that one. You had
 better ask him. 


@{b} JOHNNY B: It is just a very intriguing title though "Ghost of the
           Navigator."@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah but when he was first warbling away with it in
 rehearsals we all obviously thought it must be about flying ... but it's
 not! It is in fact about ships and stuff. It fooled us as well!"


@{b} JOHNNY B: I love the way the way the beginning builds up to a manic
          crescendo.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "See ... that's what's interesting. You obviously have
 picked up on that one after just one hearing. What I personally think is
 good about Maiden albums is that different people will all pick up on
 different songs from their first hearing. I think that is absolutely great.
 To me that shows that the album has good depth. How many albums in present
 times do you pick up and there are just a couple, maybe only one song that
 you will remember or want to hear again. Too many in my opinion.

 Invariably, most of the time people have different favourites of ours that
 they pick up on and tell us about. I think that is really good and very
 pleasing to the band, who have spent a lot of time and effort trying to
 make it as interesting as we can."


@{b} JOHNNY B: You have "Fallen Angel" and "Mercenary". Which to me are typical
           brilliant fast Maiden songs. Then you have the thematic "Nomad"
           and "The Thin Line between Love and Hate". Yet you then have
          "Brave New World" and "Dream of Mirrors" which are so different
          again.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Obviously, that shows the depth I was talking about. It is
 difficult however to analyse it all. Obviously it is a new fresh album and
 whether they are different or not different who knows. Only time will tell.

 Everyone is gonna have a different opinion. Rod likes ones you don't and
 Laz might like ones neither of you do. You have come out and said certain
 things about what you are hearing and feeling about this album but when
 I talk to the next person they might have a completely different opinion.
 They might say ... that one sounds the same as this one ... or this one
 sounds like the one a few albums ago ... or this one way influenced by
 that song. It is totally amazing the different reactions I will get over
 the next few months. That just the way things are. I think you can worry
 too much about other peoples opinions. Obviously I want everyone to like
 it but it is just impossible. That's what makes us all human ...
 well some of us!"


@{b} JOHNNY B: I think that shows what a good band and a good album it is. It is
           not just a couple of good songs and the rest is a pile of cack.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Exactly. I have always said it ... Songs are the Lifeblood
 of any band. That really is half the battle, well most of the battle
 really, having good songs is what will see you through. Songs and lyrics
 are sometimes about moods and how you are feeling at the time."


@{b} JOHNNY B: You should have written a song after the Villa match.@{ub}

 (Steve laughs)

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah I should have but we wouldn't have been allowed to play
 it. The lyrics would be banned. I might pen it anyway and give a copy to
 Coxie. (Steve Cox, Iron Maiden's Tour manager)."


@{b} JOHNNY B: How about Blood Brothers?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "It mentions about life after death, getting in touch with
 the "Other side". It touches on the Dark Side of your thoughts. It is also
 about feeling ashamed about what is happening in the world. It is about all
 these horrific things going on and people read about it in the paper but
 they just turn the page over ... and the horror is ... well muted.
 I am not saying it's forgotten because it might be on their minds but
 there's not really a lot they can do about it. It just kind of gets put
 to one side and we hope somebody somewhere takes control and guides those
 who can do something about it. The lyrics are about all sorts of things.
 There is a lot of elements to it".

 (Steve seems to be deeply affected by the thoughts running through his head
 on this subject. He seems slightly reticent to show that his lyrics are
 sometimes very deeply embedded in his own thoughts and they are of an
 extremely caring nature for the environment that his kids will grow up in.
 He pauses what seems a long while when he suddenly carries on.)

 STEVE HARRIS: "Basically it is saying that we are all made up of blood and
 tissue and there is good and bad in the world, some people are unlucky in
 life ... things like that all rolled up into one.

 You are right it is very thematic though. I have always wanted to include
 orchestral type sounds on our stuff and we have used that sort of sound
 on keyboards before. This time however it was slightly different as Kevin
 (Shirley) knew this guy in New York who does that kind of thing and layers
 it up. We sent him a tape. I put down on the tape the kind of things
 I wanted and I was amazed that he came back and did exactly what I wanted.
 That in itself was very unusual!"


@{b} JOHNNY B: Who was this keyboard guy?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "It was a guy called Geoff Bova. He is a guy that just sits
 there in his room surrounded by all different keys and sounds and he then
 takes them and layers them up. The layered version sounds really like an
 orchestra. I was really pleased with that. I was actually so pleased with
 how it turned out because I was a bit tentative when I sent out the tape
 to him, as I wondered what on earth he was going to come up. I was just
 hoping he'd do what I wanted him to do. I was a little worried in case he
 went completely over the top but he actually came up with exactly what
 I wanted so I was well pleased. I had a vision of the direction I wanted
 to take the song in and the work he did fitted in great.
 I was very pleased."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Did he do any work on the "Nomad"?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah, He did a little bit on the middle section and again
 he did exactly what I wanted him to do. The rest of the "Nomad" ...
 believe it or not ... I actually played the keyboards. The main reason for
 that is because I know what I want and I know the timings I need. I could
 get Michael (Kenney) to do it but I think by the time he has sat there and
 learnt it and the timings ... I might as well do it myself and save time
 and get exactly what I want."


@{b} JOHNNY B: How will you do that Live?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Michael Kenney will do it because I won't! I have done my
 bit! To be honest a lot of it's not that difficult. I am not any master
 keyboard player by any means of the imagination. It will be slightly harder
 for him because if I go and mess it up in the studio I just go and record
 it again. Michael has to go and learn it thoroughly but it shouldn't be
 that hard as I am not an accomplished keyboard player by any stretch of
 the imagination. Everyone MUST remember that it really is used as an effect
 for enhancing the song."


@{b} JOHNNY B: I think it works great. I think the whole mix is great. It is
           very deep and full. I love the way everything shoots all around
           you and from speaker to speaker without sounding effect laden.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Good, that's where Kevin comes into his own. He is a superb
 mixing man without a doubt. That is just another reason why we wanted to
 use him. I learnt a few little tricks from him. His expertise is great and
 we knew we wanted someone really competent. With three lead guitar players
 we knew it was gonna be tricky to say the least."


@{b} JOHNNY B: He did brilliant then because some of the guitar sections
           are superb.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah the solos are, they really are. However when you are
 trying to cram it all in with three guitars, rhythm guitars, drums and
 stuff, it is very hard. There is a hell of a lot going on. It really is
 not easy to do. We have always tried to have albums where there is a whole
 lot of stuff going on."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Dream of Mirrors ... can you explain the thinking behind
           that track?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Well ... It is about the dark side of things. It's about
 people's thoughts and how they suffer from dreams and nightmares and all
 sorts. That was the main influence and source of materialI think dreams
 are so intriguing and you never really have an answer for them so therefore
 it is endless. I feel there are more songs than pictures about that sort
 of thing and I find it a fascinating subject."

@node "intense 4"

@{b} INTENSE PERCEPTIONS@{ub} ... Part 4 (20.04.2000)


@{b} JOHNNY B: It starts fast and then goes to a slow dreamlike sequence which
           you imagine in black and white because of the clever lyrics.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Nine times out ten we will already have a melody, a really
 strong melody and we will write the lyrics to the melody. That's how we do
 things usually. So then we are trying to fit a lyric to a melody that may
 have already created a mood. You then have to write something that will
 suit that, you can't really write something that won't suit that song.
 That is where lyrically I get my inspiration from, the vibe and the mood
 of the song."


@{b} JOHNNY B: I thought it was a great song to follow "The Mercenary" which
           is a real fast blockbuster of a song.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "When we pan an album out we try and have light and shade in
 your album. We had "Blood Brothers" which is a quiet at the beginning and
 end. We thought that "Mercenary" will bring the tempo back up again.
 We then thought that "Dream of Mirrors" which has those quiet sequences
 near the beginning will slow the pace again.


@{b} JOHNNY B: Is there a reasoning behind "The Mercenary".@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah but it really is about a bounty hunter. We named
 it "The Mercenary" purely because we didn't want to call it "The Bounty
 Hunter".


@{b} JOHNNY B: What about the "Fallen Angel"?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Age old thing really. It is all about Good Versus Evil.
 To me the whole song is musically influenced by "Thin Lizzy". It has that
 celtic vibe to it at the beginning that is very "Lizzy". I think the song
 is very ... well not commercial ... but the chorus hook is very catchy.


@{b} JOHNNY B: I loved the whole thing about "The Nomad", the long guitarfests,
           the epic feel of the whole track, the orchestral bit, the
           stirring lyrics I thought it is a highlight of the album.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Thanks ... lets hope everyone else thinks so. We called it
 "The Nomad" as it has that whole Arabian vibe to it. "The Nomad" summed up
 the whole feel and vibe of the song. The theme of the music was great and
 this is what I was talking about before, where the vibe of the music sends
 us in the right direction for the lyrics. It was definitely one of those
 sort of tracks. The vibe was very middle eastern and that is what inspired
 the lyrics. We were all thinking of the desert and stuff."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Then we have the track "Silent Planet" which if you were
           looking for that "taster" you described earlier surely this
           is commercially friendly?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Well ... it definitely has a catchy chorus, well two
 choruses really. It has a chorus and a sub chorus really. It had a feel
 about it when we were recording like when we did "The Evil That Men Do".
 That had a strong bridge, which could have been a chorus and then you hit
 the real chorus which takes you even higher. Bruce wrote the lyrics for
 that one."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Was it based on the film?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Don't think so. Again it sets off quiet and builds up to
 violent ending. We love doing that type of stuff." 


@{b} JOHNNY B: The Thin Line Between Love and Hate" ... that's got to be one
           of the longest Maiden titles in years hasn't it?@{ub}
          
 (again Steve laughs out loud)

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah ... "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" was pretty long.
 Again the song has lots of different moods in it. The bits in the middle
 and the end are real favourites of mine. They really have a great moody
 feel to them. There was a different direction for some of the writing.
 Some of it was new for us as we wanted to try a few new and different
 things." 

 "Despite what some people say and again it really depends on who you are
 talking to, some people say we are not different enough. Other people say
 we are too different from our last albums ... we don't really analyse it
 but I think there is quite a lot of different stuff going on here.

 I don't really think that people should try and pigeon hole us. It's not
 just this album, over all the albums we have had new stuff going on all
 the time. We write from the heart and how we feel at the time. We are all
 changing all the time and experiencing different and new things so that
 obviously affects how we write and play. All those people who say we just
 play one type of thing have obviously never listened to one of our albums
 properly. I really think that Maiden albums are something that you have to
 listen to a few times to appreciate it. Our albums are not instant stuff.
 One or two of choruses maybe but there is a hell of a lot of instrumental
 stuff. We hope that there is a little bit more to our albums that make them
 thought provoking. They are not something that you can take in instantly
 ... well not the whole album anyway. It doesn't matter who the artist is
 sometimes you have to persevere a little bit and some people can't be
 bothered with that. The attention span of some people is ... well ...
 pretty minute to say the least!"


@{b} JOHNNY B: I felt the album was a lot rockier this time ...
           or was that just me?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "It is your perception of it. This is probably gonna be the
 first released interview about this album and we are gonna get asked this
 question so many times so don't feel bad about asking it. However ... I'll
 give you the answer I probably will give all of them ... people perceive
 things in different ways. 

 Some people are going to say it's a rockier album. Some are gonna say it's
 a more progressive album, some will even say it's more commercial. It will
 amaze us as always with what perceptions people will come up with.
 The answer to all of them is ... GREAT! Get out of it what you want but
 don't go pigeon holing us. Listen to it a few times and then see if your
 original perception is the same."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Are there any songs that you finished off that didn't make
           the album?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "No, not at all. We don't work that way. We write and then
 work on whatever we need. We never write say twenty songs and then just
 use ten, we would never do that."


@{b} JOHNNY B: I guess it is all steam ahead now. The albums finished so I guess
           it is off to mastering, shoot a video and off on tour.@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Sounds scary but yeah, that's basically our lives mapped
 out. We master the album and then after a few weeks of promotion, where
 we pair off and go off doing press all around the world, we rehearse.
 We have to go out and do the press stuff so that we give the album a good
 opportunity to do well. It allows all the record company and our guys to
 go out and promote the thing properly. 

 People will not know it's there unless we put the ground work in promoting
 it. We can never take things for granted. We have a pretty hardcore
 following but you cannot just expect people to cough up, hard earned cash
 for something they have not heard about. The groundwork is important so you
 have to go out and do that sort of thing. Now we go and rehearse the tour
 and do the best show we can.

 What will be nice about this tour is that we are going out based on a new
 album. It was kind of hard for me on the last tour to go out and play a set
 where we didn't have any new songs. It was great on one hand for us all to
 get back together and for it to go so well but I found it particularly
 difficult myself. That's because I like to go out on tour with new stuff.
 I like to have the conviction in new material and give an impression like
 that.

 I am looking forward to this tour more. I really am ... purely for that
 reason. I love to see the crowds reactions to new songs. I think it is
 a great challenge to go out and play new stuff."


@{b} JOHNNY B: But don't the fans love to see you come and play your
           greatest songs?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Yeah, of course. They want to hear old stuff as well but it
 is really nice to go and play new stuff. You can look at it from another
 way. If we DON'T go and play brand new stuff how will any of the new songs
 ever become great live songs. Everyone seems to have a different song they
 like to us playing live. Some like Run To The Hills, others love Fear Of
 The Dark. How would they know that these are great songs live if we had
 never had the faith in our convictions to play new stuff, on previous
 tours.

 I think it is challenging and sometimes I even think it's quite brave of us
 to play the amount of new stuff that we do. Whenever we go out on tour with
 a new album we always play at least 6 new songs. A lot of people don't do
 that. They are scared of reactions so they only play one new song. They are
 worried about people bitching about new material but I think it just shows
 a lack of confidence in their new product. I have always wondered at that
 myself ... I think it is a bit strange. If they think they have written
 a good new album ... go out and play it to the fans ... that's the only way
 you will find out if it really is any good."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Are you going to play any places that you have never
           played before?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Oh yeah ... there are places already lined up and hopefully
 there will be more. We are playing Estonia, Ukraine and places like that.
 I always like playing new places it is a challenge. It is still a challenge
 to go back and play at places you have played before because you still have
 to go and prove yourself all over again. Hopefully, the fans will leave
 thinking you were even better than the last time they saw you. Having said
 that I really like to go to new places to see crowds reactions and obviously
 ... as a tourist. I finds it refreshing to go to new places."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Will you get to more places than you did on the Ed Hunter tour?@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Oh yeah, Ed Hunter was a very short tour. It was really only
 a couple of dozen shows, which is nothing for us really. This will be quite
 a long tour. Not as long as some of the previous long tours purely because
 we are doing a festival tour. With the festivals you can play one show and
 reach the same amount of people as you would reach with five or six shows.
 This is different because it is a summer tour. If we do a winter tour then
 obviously we cannot play festivals so we do a longer tour to make up for
 it."


@{b} JOHNNY B: Well I wish you all the best for the tour and the new album.
           I think the new album has a real depth to it. I absolutely love
           some of the new tracks and cannot wait to be jumping up and down
           with the crowds to "Navigator".@{ub}

 STEVE HARRIS: "Thanks. See you all there ...... somewhere!"

@{b} CONQUERING THE BRAVE NEW WORLD@{ub} (28 July 2000)

 Throughout June and July, Iron Maiden laid waste to Europe, playing to
 thousands of fans on their mighty Metal 2000 tour. The tour hasn't been
 a completely smooth ride - it's been dogged by bad weather and more
 seriously, three shows had to be cancelled after guitarist Janick Gers
 fell more than ten feet from the stage at the end of their show in
 Mannheim, Germany. However, on the whole, it's been a triumph, with the
 band showcasing their new revamped line-up of Bruce Dickinson (vocals),
 Steve Harris (bass), Nicko McBrain (drums) and Janick, Adrian Smith and
 Dave Murray (guitars) and songs from their latest album "Brave New World"
 to thousands of enthusiastic fans. 

 Metal-is Editor @{b}Valerie Potter@{ub} sat down with Steve backstage at the final
 show on the European tour (as the rain poured down outside!) to chat about
 the shows and the forthcoming "Brave New World" tour of North America.


@{b} How has the European tour been for you?@{ub}

 Fantastic. There have been great audiences everywhere; they know every word
 of every song. It's kind of what we expect from Europe anyway, it's always
 been Maiden's stronghold, but as we've had a No. 1 album in Greece, Sweden
 and places like that, Top 10 pretty much everywhere and a gold disc in
 Spain already, it's been amazing. 


@{b} You must be pleased with the reaction that 'Brave New World' has received
 all over the world, though.@{ub}

 Yeah, we're playing a lot of new material - we always do anyway with every
 new album - but the reactions have been great, so it's been very positive.


@{b} I have seen a few reviews which complain that you're not playing enough old
 material on this tour...@{ub}

 Oh, you always get that! It's just ridiculous. If they wanted that, they
 should have come on the (1999) 'Ed Hunter' tour. Whatever. "Bugger off!"
 is the answer to that one!


@{b} ...but I think they have been balanced by critics saying how much they've
 enjoyed hearing the new songs live.@{ub}

 We enjoy playing it, and that's the main thing, really. We've got to please
 ourselves first. The audience come close second obviously, but we've got to
 feel that we're going out there with a refreshing attitude and playing
 something that's a bit of a challenge. We know we could go out and play
 greatest hits sets and go down fantastically well, but what would that
 prove? Not a lot.


@{b} And of course, as you say, you did that last year on the 'Ed Hunter' tour.@{ub}

 We did it only on a few shows, I know, but if we had a 'best of' album out,
 it might be different. It's a new album, and it's important to play the new
 stuff - this is where we are now. There's always cynical people about -
 especially journalists... "Miserable gits!" is what I say!


@{b} The omission of "Run To The Hills" from this year's set has been most
 noticed, I think. At this stage in your career, it must be very difficult
 to figure out a setlist - you can't play all the old hits, after all.@{ub}

 'Course you can't. It's just one of those things. You've got two hours -
 and in the States, we'll probably have slightly less, because you have to
 deal with all the union stuff which you don't have in Europe - so it's
 difficult... very difficult.


@{b} How do you go about it? Do you decide what you want to play off the new
 album first and then fit everything else around it, or are there certain
 old songs you feel you have to play at every show?@{ub}

 Yeah, we sort out what we want to play from the new stuff and then we go
 through each album and play one or two songs off that. Everyone puts in
 their ideas as to what they fancy playing and we mess around with it for
 a while, get some semblance of a set together and start rehearsing it,
 see how it feels. And this set feels good.


@{b} Are there any songs from the new album that are standing out as your
 favourites, now that you've been playing them a while?@{ub}

 I don't know really. I suppose, because we open up with three new songs,
 that's good, because I think a lot of bands wouldn't do that, so that's
 quite a challenge. There's not really any songs that I would say
 I musically prefer playing more than any others; I enjoy playing them
 all really.


@{b} Is it true that a thundercloud has followed you all round Europe on
 this tour?!@{ub}

 In actual fact, someone said we were like The Addams Family, because there
 was thunder and lightning everywhere we went! Yeah, we did have a lot of
 that. There were a couple of nice days here and there, but it seemed to
 be any time we were playing out of doors, it was raining, apart from when
 we were playing in Spain and Portugal. Luckily enough, we are actually
 indoors tonight! We blame it on the tour manager - every time he turns
 up somewhere, it starts raining!


@{b} And you told me earlier this year that the thunderstorm you played in when
 you headlined Holland's Dynamo Festival was the worst weather the band has
 ever played in?@{ub}

 We've been very, very lucky over the years, because we've played loads of
 outdoor shows and there's been quite a few of them where it's been crap
 weather, but it's stopped raining just before we went on and started again
 just as we were coming off. That's happened many times and quite often,
 you think to yourself, "There must be somebody upstairs that likes us!"
 But Dynamo definitely was the worst. It was pissing down throughout the
 whole show and I thought total respect for the fans, because they didn't
 leave, they were determined to have a good time no matter what, so it was
 fantastic. And it wasn't warm either, it was pretty cold, and getting
 pissed upon when you're freezing as well can't be much fun!
 We got wet as well, despite what some people (journalists) might have said,
 because the catwalks were absolutely soaking. It was very frustrating;
 we couldn't run around and do our normal show, because it was so slippery
 and wet on the stage. The rain was sweeping in and getting us wet as well,
 but obviously, we weren't getting as wet as they were out front. 


@{b} Speaking of mishaps on the tour, how is Janick now?@{ub}

 He's alright. Well, he's not 100 per cent alright, but he's getting better,
 day by day. He was pretty bad... I suppose it could have been worse, in a
 way... He had quite a few stitches in a cut on his left eyebrow and a
 cracked collarbone, he had concussion, unbelievable bruising - he looked
 like somebody had painted him! Luckily enough, he doesn't remember any of
 it. He only remembers waking up in the ambulance and hearing us do
 "Hallowed..." and thinking, 'I should be playing my solo on this!'
 That's what he said, yeah! The weird thing was, when they took him off on
 the stretcher, we thought maybe he wasn't too bad, because, although he was
 covered in claret everywhere - I could see the cut was above the eye and
 you always bleed badly from a cut there anyway - he was waving to us, but
 he doesn't remember any of that.
 I never saw it happen, 'cause I was right on the catwalk on the other side.
 I heard one of the guitars go off, but I thought the gear had packed up.
 Then Bruce said about stopping the show, and first and foremost in my head
 was that someone had been hurt in the audience, because all the paramedics
 were going over. And then of course, as I ran over the other side and
 looked over, it was dear old Jan.


@{b} It must have been a terrible shock.@{ub}

 Yeah, it was a bit strange - it didn't look too good, because he was
 laying on his back, covered in blood, and he wasn't moving too much.
 That was during "Number Of The Beast" and we decided to carry on and do
 that song again and then do "Hallowed..." and then we didn't bother to do
 "Sanctuary". And it felt weird, I must admit, doing them. But with 14,000
 people in the audience, we thought we couldn't just stop. I suppose,
 because it was old stuff we were playing in the encores, we could get by
 doing it with the two guitar players, but that's why we had to pull the
 other three shows - Essen, Sofia and Athens - because he plays a lot of
 key parts on the new material and there's no way we could have done it
 with two guitars.


@{b} You just mentioned trouble in the audience. You played the Roskilde
 festival the night before the tragic deaths during Pearl Jam's set,
 and of course, you had a similar experience 12 years ago, when two fans
 died the day you headlined the Donington Monsters Of Rock festival,
 although the accident didn't actually occur during your set. Any thoughts
 on what Pearl Jam must be going through at this time?@{ub}

 I suppose it's difficult to know what it feels like, because it's never
 actually happened to us. It did happen at Donington, but it didn't happen
 during our set, as you say, and we didn't know about it either, no one told
 us about it until after the show, so, you know... It must be awful really,
 to think that this happened during their set, but... I don't know, we've
 played for 20 years, gigs all round the world, and we've never really had
 any problems. 
 When something like this happens, you can't start pointing fingers and
 saying it's this or that. Roskilde's been running for so many years, with
 that many people very year, it's been a very traditional kind of festival.
 In fact, we played there once before and it was absolutely peeing down with
 rain that particular time as well - most of the weekend in fact - and it
 was very muddy, and there were no problems that time at all.
 I heard different conflicting reports as to what had happened and why,
 so I'm not really qualified to say what happened, 'cause I wasn't there
 obviously. All I can say is, the night we played, there were no problems
 and then it absolutely peed down all that night apparently and all day
 as well, and maybe that contributed to the problem, I don't know.


@{b} Okay, we've talked about some of the low points on this tour. What about
 the high points?@{ub}

 As I said, it's been a fantastic tour. San Sebastian was great, Madrid
 was great, Paris was great... There were so many great shows, it's
 difficult to pick one and say that was the high point, really. In fact,
 one of the shows that I really enjoyed was in Banska (Slovakia), and that
 was just fantastic. That was because it kind of almost didn't happen.
 It was bad weather as well. When we got there, the crew were wondering
 whether we should do the show, because the stage was totally soaked and
 there were problems with the power... and we just said, "No, there are all
 these fans waiting outside - as long as you can sort the problems with the
 power out, we'll do the show." And I'm glad we did, because it was great.


@{b} Do you feel warmed up and ready for the US tour now - which is quite
 a long one?@{ub}

 It's a couple of months, but we've already been out a couple of months
 anyway. Yes, it's long and there's not a lot of days off, so it's going
 to be a tough tour, but, you know.. that's nothing new, is it - specially
 with Rod (Smallwood, Maiden manager) in charge?! But I think it's going
 to be good. The bill is strong. I'm looking forward to seeing Halford,
 because I like the album and it will be interesting to see what reception
 he gets. Queensrÿche, obviously, we've done gigs with before and I like
 them anyway.


@{b} I hear you're taking your family out and travelling by bus around
 the States?@{ub}

 I'm flying some shows with Bruce, but I'm taking the family out for about
 five weeks during the school holidays, so that will be good. When I told
 them I was going to use a tour bus or a motor home, they were totally
 excited about that, because they love being on the bus, they don't get off
 on flying around everywhere. It's a good vibe, isn't it, I suppose,
 an adventure? As it's a summer tour, we'll probably stay out of town on
 camp sites and stuff like that - it'll be fun.


@{b} Will you be able to organise any football matches for the band team,
 as you have on this European tour?@{ub}

 I doubt it, because we're all doing different things, staying in different
 areas, Bruce is flying his plane, the rest of them are flying scheduled
 and I'm off doing my thing with the kids in the bus. We haven't really got
 a team either, and we can only really play on days off because of the crew
 working on show days. What I'm really hoping to do is find a couple of
 teams who have games, so I can star in their team - or not star, as the
 case may be! - but just get a game. So any offers of having the odd game
 here and there would be great, I'd be up for that. But I've got to say,
 it has to be proper 11-a-side, with the full strip, a referee and proper
 goals and nets and stuff! I ain't gonna turn up just to have a kickabout
 in a backyard somewhere - I'm not into that!


@{b} You must be very pleased with the fact that your show at Madison Square
 Garden sold out so fast?@{ub}

 Two hours - I think it's pretty amazing. And I suppose it's a prestige gig.
 We've done it a couple of times before and I can't remember whether it sold
 out really quickly last time, it's been a long while since we did it, but
 it's a vibe to play there anyway, and to sell out so quickly is great.
 I dare say the fact that it's a strong bill must have helped, but having
 said that, not taking anything away from ourselves, I think it's great.


@{b} Do you still enjoy touring now as much as you used to?@{ub}

 I enjoy the gigs as much as I've ever done, but the travelling becomes
 a bit tiresome, I've got to say. Being away from the family is the hardest
 part, but the fact that they will be out with me in the States makes it
 fine. It's not easy, touring. That's the thing, I think... if the band
 ever knocks it on the head, it's because of that, because we're fed up
 with being away from our homes and families. But once we've had a bit of
 time off and recharged the batteries, I think everyone will probably be
 itching to get out there again. But who knows? Maybe they won't.
 They might feel, 'I could get used to this, being at home!' We'll see.


@{b} When I interviewed Bruce earlier this year, I was really surprised that,
 after all these years, he told me that he gets very nervous before shows
 when he's had a lay-off from the road for a while. Do you feel the same?@{ub}

 Well, of course, 'cause you're not confident, I suppose. You still get
 nervous anyway, to a certain degree, but you're bound to be nervous, if
 you've been off the road for a while doing an album. No matter how much
 you rehearse, it's not the same as getting out there and doing it,
 so yeah. But there's no harm in that, really, is there?


@{b} What happens at the end of the North American tour?@{ub}

 We've got Mexico and then we go to South America - Brazil, Argentina,
 Chile - and then Japan. Then three shows in the UK, and that's about it.
 I don't think anything is going to happen after that - but knowing Rod,
 it's difficult to say! Certainly, I think, if anything else gets added
 in there, it will be finished by mid-November.


@{b} Metal-is had an e-mail from a Maiden fan who wanted to know why Australia
 had been 'excluded' from the Brave New World tour (hi, Victoria!). What's
 the story there?@{ub}

 I think originally we were hoping to do some shows down there and then
 it got shortened down to a couple of shows and then nothing at all. I think
 that's mainly through the problem of physically freighting everything
 everywhere. I'm pretty sure we'll do it on the next tour - and I'd like to
 do New Zealand as well. But, I suppose, to be honest - not from our point
 of view, but from Rod's point of view - the albums haven't sold as well
 there as anywhere else either. You go where you're wanted, basically,
 and I know there's some fans that want us down there, but maybe Rod felt
 there wasn't enough, I don't know.


@{b} What is the plan for 2001? Will you record another album?@{ub}

 No. Next year will be off, other than we're thinking about doing a live
 album and if we do that, it will need to be mixed, so I'll do that.
 But other than that, it will be off. I think we deserve it. This is the
 end of a three year cycle for four of us, which goes way back to before
 doing the 'Virtual XI' album. We had ten weeks at home after that nine
 month 'Virtual XI' tour and apart from that, we've been home the odd day
 here and there, so it's been almost three years.


@{b} With the band riding the crest of a wave at the moment, this must be
 a good time to be a member of Iron Maiden?@{ub}

 Yeah, it's probably a good time to be in any band playing this kind of
 music at the moment, because there seems to be a buzz out there for it
 again. We're doing very well and it's gone from strength to strength.
 The last three albums, the last three tours, have been going up and up
 and up, and it's great. I think metal has been on the incline, definitely.

@node "Metal-Is 1."

@{b} AROUND THE WORLD IN 15 DAYS!@{ub} ... Part 1 (10.05.2000)

 Jules Verne's heroes did it in 80 days - but IRON MAIDEN vocalist
 Bruce Dickinson circumvented the globe in just a fortnight on a recent
 worldwide promotional trip. With "Brave New World", the much-anticipated
 new Iron Maiden album - the first to be recorded with the revamped
 line-up with frontman Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith rejoining
 bassist Steve Harris, guitarists Dave Murray and Janick Gers and drummer
 Nicko McBrain - scheduled for release on 29th May, it seems that every
 music publication in the world wants to get the scoop on the latest
 recordings. Hence Bruce's global excursion.

 Metal-is Editor VALERIE POTTER caught up with the weary singer in
 Paris, where he talked about the rigours of an arduous promo schedule
 and revealed that video shoots in Los Angeles are not always as glamorous
 as they sound!


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: You've just flown completely round the world.@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: I will have done by tomorrow, yes. I started in L.A. on
 Saturday, arrived in Sydney on Monday morning, then arrived in Tokyo on
 Wednesday morning, then I was in Stockholm on Saturday night, Cologne on
 Monday, Milan on Wednesday, Brussels on Wednesday night, Paris on Thursday
 and I'm back to L.A. tomorrow. Then I go straight to Mexico City, then to
 New York for three days, then to Brazil for three days, then back to L.A.
 and I'm missing a day somewhere - I don't know what happened then!


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: And you haven't really had time to see much of the
                 countries you've visited.@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: When I flew from L.A. to Sydney, it took 14 hours. You
 get there at eight in the morning and you start interviews at 12 o'clock
 and then you work through 'til the next night, when you fly off to Tokyo
 at ten o'clock, get there at six in the morning and you start interviews
 at 11 o'clock the same day. So you're just cracking through this schedule
 and it's not actually been that bad, but, of course, when it gets to the
 evening, all of a sudden, you fall asleep in the sushi if you're in Japan
 or the meat pie if you're in Australia, and it's 'Sorry, I have to go to
 bed now!'


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Don't you find it disorienting that, although you're
                 constantly travelling from country to country, many of the
                 questions you're being asked every day must be the same?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: It's not been too bad so far - but it's very strange that
 the closer I get to England, the bitchier people get! When we were in
 Germany and Sweden and Italy, they were all 'Great to hear the album,
 it's really cool, and it's great that you're all back together!' Then as
 soon as we land in France, it's like 'Aha, I see that you and Steve are
 in separate rooms doing interviews - what does this mean?!' 'That way we
 can get twice as many interviews done.' 'But it really means that you hate
 each other, doesn't it?' 'No, it doesn't actually and I don't believe we
 do, unless this is news to me!' 'Yes, this is the company line, isn't it?'
 'NO!' Jesus Christ! I've just spent a whole day of UK interviews here,
 saying the same thing. Everybody in the UK wants it to be Mick and Keith,
 or Daltrey and Townshend, or something! I might have to start lying in
 future and tell them that only the other morning, we were duelling with
 baseball bats at breakfast, or some crap like that!


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: What is the best question you've been asked in this
                 round of promotion?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: There's actually been a singular lack of 'best questions'.
 In Australia, I had to do an interview with Australian "FHM" to see if
 I passed the 'Bloke Test', so there were 20 questions on whether or not
 I was a true 'bloke' - and bear in mind, you had to be a true Aussie bloke,
 so you really had to be pretty gross to pass this test! One of the
 questions was, 'Had I ever fallen asleep while shagging?' Another was,
 'What would I do if my lawnmower broke down?' And 'Had I ever fallen off
 a motorbike?' I said no, but I'd fallen off a moped - would that do?
 I think I was a bloke, 'cause I'd done all of the worst things that they
 could imagine - and more! - but the lawnmower one got me a bit flustered!


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: And what was the worst question?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: 'What is the most outrageous thing that anyone has ever
 said about you?' 'Cause I couldn't think of a single outrageous thing that
 anybody had said about me that wasn't true, and therefore it wasn't
 outrageous to me.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Are you sick of doing promotion and ready to get back to
                 playing music again?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: I've got a little bit of 'grin and bear it' and actually,
 I've still got a few more 'Avengers' episodes to watch on DVD. I do find
 that the long plane flights are pretty good, because I can get two or
 three episodes done before I get to the destination and I can crack a
 couple of beers. If you're doing promotion whilst pissed, eventually the
 mouth stops moving, so you stay extremely straight! But it's not too bad.
 I'm going to be really glad when we start rehearsing and get stuck into
 it properly, 'cause I must confess, at the moment, I am a tad apprehensive
 about the first gig - and the second gig, and the third gig! Because we
 won't have done a gig this year and the first one we're going to do is in
 front of 30,000 people, so I am mildly crapping myself - but not yet
 I don't think there's any purpose in letting it get to you just yet -
 there are, after all, two months to go!


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: After all these years, you still get nervous before shows?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: I definitely do when I haven't done any for a while. It's
 the fear of screwing up and the fear of losing your voice and all of those
 other type things. And then after a while, it turns into a positive thing,
 an excitement where you're really looking forward to doing the show,
 because you know you have the confidence to deliver, so the adrenaline of
 'Oh God, please don't let me screw up!' turns into the adrenaline of
 'This is going to be great, let's go and do it!'


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: But the Maiden shows last year went so well,
                 you must have taken confidence from that.@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Oh yeah, but it doesn't last very long. It only lasts 'til
 the next gig! It's very bizarre, but it's true. With me, that aspect of it
 goes after three or four shows, so if I have a break of a week, I'm like,
 'Oh help, here we go again!' for the first couple of gigs and it's a relief
 to get the first one over with.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: When you were last in L.A., you shot a video for the
                 first single from the album, "The Wicker Man".@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Yes, under massively adverse circumstances! Three Celsius,
 torrential rain and me and Janick were up for 25 hours straight! Steve got
 food poisoning and did his performances between visits to the toilet -
 for which a French magazine gave him a terribly bad write-up. They said he
 was an awfully bad sport and didn't look cheerful! Get a fucking life!
 The guy had the drizzling shits, it was freezing cold and pissing down
 with rain! At least we had nice, warm winnebagos. The audience were stuck
 with space heaters and a tent - and that nearly blew down in the middle
 of the howling rain! Not to mention the semi-naked nymphs, who didn't have
 anything except a couple of torches to keep them warm. In fact, one of them
 was a real pyromaniac and had actually set fire to herself on a previous
 occasion. We were all standing around, shivering, and she kept saying,
 'I'm not cold at all - I'm generating my own inner fire! You should get
 in touch with it, you know!' We all went, 'Ah, yeah, okay - we'll take
 the winnebagos!'


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: And while you were on the set, you were also hanging out
                 with Twiggy from Marilyn Manson and Dave Navarro?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Oh yeah, they showed up in the back of the truck and had
 their pictures taken. I'm not sure anybody knew who they were Merck came
 in and said, 'Here's Twiggy and Dave Navarro!' and a lot of the guys in
 the band went, 'Ah, great - who are they?'


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: There has been much debate about the forthcoming album
                 on the Internet, and a lot of misinformation has been
                 posted there too. Do you see the Internet as a blessing
                 or a curse?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Honestly - if I had to pick whether I prefer my life
 pre- or post-Internet, I prefer pre-Internet, because it was a lot easier
 to keep secrets and to keep things more dramatic, if you like. Basically,
 the Internet is almost like having someone eavesdrop your every thought
 and from that point of view, it's a pain. Yes, it's nice to be able to
 converse with fans directly - but you can't possibly converse with
 2 million people directly and if people get into the habit of imagining
 that they can, it becomes a tyranny, because they then get pissed off that
 you never talk to them. So I think the best thing to be is a sort of
 Internet recluse. I'm an Internet recluse, 'cause I can't even get my
 computer to get on the Internet except in America, so I am by definition
 a person who never reads his e-mails.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: So that wasn't really you, causing consternation and
                 confusion, by purportedly posting messages on Iron Maiden's
                 official website last night then?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: No, I've never been on the Iron Maiden site, except for
 a couple of times in the last year. How exciting! Phantom Internet
 imposters! The flipside of this is I did an official thing with a radio
 station in Berlin about a year ago and it was set up that I would be online
 and broadcasting at the same time. So there I am online and nobody would
 believe it was me! They were asking me questions like, 'It's not really
 you, is it?' and I was like, 'It IS me! I'm supposed to be here!' so then
 they'd say, 'If it is you, then answer THIS!' and they'd ask me a question
 about one of my albums. I didn't fucking know the answer! I was like,
 'I can't remember!' 'If you WERE Bruce, you'd know!'


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Do you find it a big difference, after your years as
                 a solo artist when you were having to sell yourself,
                 to now, when there is so much interest in Iron Maiden,
                 you're practically having to beat the journalists off
                 with a stick?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Actually, it's not that big a change, because when I was
 a solo artist, they still managed to find 57 people to do interviews with
 me in three days. So I was sat in a small, airless room in Cologne for
 three days, doing 17 interviews a day, and now I do maybe six or seven
 or eight interviews a day, so from that point of view, the workload has
 halved, which is a good thing! Obviously, the impact of the interviews
 is much greater, because you're talking to a bunch of big magazines or
 an interview for national TV, so you've got to be more of a switched on
 cookie when people start asking you sometimes interesting or probing
 questions, which could open up a can of worms if you don't give a response
 with your brain switched on. But I don't mind that. I'd rather have to use
 my head for six hours and talk than go onto autopilot for ten hours and
 just blather out the same thing over and over and over again, when you
 could half the time stick all the journalists in one room, give them all
 one tape recorder and say, 'Now, listen carefully', because sometimes
 you can virtually predict a lot of the questions. But with some of the
 interviews I've been doing recently, it's been quite entertaining, and
 there have occasionally been quite thought-provoking questions - but
 there's been so many of them, I can't necessarily remember any of the
 fucking questions! 


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: On the verge of releasing a new album, how does it feel
                 to be part of a team again, as opposed to carrying it all
                 on your shoulders as a solo artist?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: It's actually very good. When we were recording the
 record, that's when it really hits home that you can look over your
 shoulder and there's somebody there on the wing and there's a full-back
 over there and Nicko's in goal sort of deal. You really get that sensation
 that it's a team effort in the studio, particularly because we recorded
 the album live. Then you get it again when we're all together and listening
 to what we've done collectively, and we all get real good vibes off it.
 And then we take off to the four winds, doing our promo. Steve and Janick
 are in Europe, Dave and Adrian are in South America and then we're all
 meeting up in Mexico City to go through the setlist and doing some jamming
 on what tunes to pick for the next tour. So the next time that the A Team
 gets together is actually on Tuesday and I'm kinda looking forward to that,
 because I must say that, after whizzing round doing all these interviews
 on my own, it's going to be a relief to get back together under one roof,
 shut the door and start playing music together again. That's when you
 really get the feeling that it's a team.

 @{b}AROUND THE WORLD IN 15 DAYS!@{ub} ... Part 2 (03.06.2000)

 @{b}THE TIME HAS COME!@{ub}

 Last month, Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson had a chat with metal-is
 from the middle of his hectic promotional trip round the world. This month,
 in the second part of that interview, he tells us about some of the songs
 on the band's new album, 'Brave New World'.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Who came up with the title 'Brave New World'?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: I suggested 'Brave New World' for the title within
 a couple of months of rejoining the band and everybody pretty much thought
 it was a decent idea, so I set about re-reading Aldous Huxley and writing
 the words for the song. Then after recording 'Wicker Man' or thereabouts,
 in a sudden fit of enthusiasm, we all decided that 'Wicker Man' would be
 a great idea for an album title, because of the fantastic imagery to do
 with the movie. So we stayed with that until we got the artwork back just
 after Christmas and that just didn't cut it, so then it went back to
 'Brave New World' and by this time, there was a massive panic, because
 everything had to be changed around!


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: As you say, some of the song titles on the new record,
                 such as 'Brave New World' and 'Out Of The Silent Planet'
                 seem to relate to book titles.@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Yes, although with 'Out Of The Silent Planet', what
 I did in my tiny infantile brain was that I based the song on a chunk
 of the movie 'The Forbidden Planet', whose sub-title is 'Monsters From
 The Id'. So it's a pretty straight sci-fi romp.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: And was 'The Wicker Man' inspired by the film of the
                 same name?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: I came up with it and the song is really actually nothing
 to do with the film, but it does have the line in it, "The shadow of the
 Wicker Man is rising up again". I was going to call it 'Your Time Will
 Come', but Steve said, 'The Wicker Man's cool' and I said, "Yeah, it
 is kinda cool oh stuff it, yeah, 'The Wicker Man'. Bang! There's a video!"


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: So 'The Wicker Man' is only to do with the song
                 by association.@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: What the song is about is destiny and that it's your turn
 today to have your day in the sun. It's your turn to change the world, the
 day when you wake up and think, 'God, I could do anything today!' It's like
 the first day of spring - and that's the 'Wicker Man' association, because
 in the movie, the Wicker Man is the sacrifice that creates this island of
 eternal spring on which Britt Ekland leaps about covered in blue dye!
 I tried in the song to get the idea of what it was I felt when I was
 standing in front of 50,000 people on a really, really great day, like
 a Bercy (an arena in Paris) with Maiden, when you're singing something
 and everybody gets it and they're singing along with you - exactly what
 it feels like at that moment - and I tried to encapsulate that in different
 little ways in the lyrics, as if to say, "You can do that too in your own
 life, your time will come" sort of vibe.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Does 'Ghost Of The Navigator' have anything to do with
                 the film called 'Flight Of The Navigator'?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: 'Ghost Of The Navigator' is a sort of a metaphor for life.
 I won't go into all the various bits of free association by which I arrived
 at the lyrics, but it's basically a navigator smashing his way through the
 seas on a journey which is uncertain even why he's making it. He might not
 make it, it's like he's destined to do this journey because of his past,
 why he doesn't know, where it is even he doesn't know, he just has to go
 there, and he's determined that he's not going to get distracted by the
 ghosts of all the other navigators who failed before him. He ploughs on
 through day and night and all the hallucinations of lack of sleep, his
 compass is swinging crazily, and he's still going on. And that's what the
 song is all about, it's kind of a metaphor for life. It's like, why do
 people carry on? It's because they want to feel things. And that's what
 the message of the song is. The line of the song is "Nothing's real until
 you feel" and that's what the navigator is searching for the whole time.
 He's just gonna carry on 'til death, until he feels it.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Another song which sounds like it has an interesting
                 story behind it is 'Dream Of Mirrors'. That's one of
                 Steve Harris', isn't it?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: He has a lot of dreams. He's always been a bit of an
 insomniac. Steve's obviously fairly introverted and has a lot of stuff
 to do with déjà vu and out of body experiences and this kind of stuff,
 and 'Dream Of Mirrors' has a lot of themes that he's dealt with in other
 songs, but this one is just really, really well-executed and the chorus
 is drop-dead one of the best things he's written in years. The lyric is
 just fantastic, it's really, really memorable and it's a great tune.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: You're describing these songs in terms of stories. Do you
                 need to find a story line in order to write a song?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: If I don't have a story, I need to create one, a little
 myth just for myself to write it. I find it more difficult to relate to
 songs that don't have stories associated with them or don't have a story
 that I can manufacture in my head. If I can put a movie together in my head
 when I'm singing a song, then I find life much easier.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Does that mean that when you perform them live, you're
                 acting them out?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Yes


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Getting into character?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: It's not quite like that. It's almost like channelling
 the song. It's not acting, the song is just playing through you and you're
 seeing it in your head as you tell it, you're telling a story basically.
 But that's how I view it, yeah.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Your voice is sounding fantastic on the new record.@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Yeah, a few people have said that and I'm dead chuffed!
 And I'm also pleasantly surprised, because the whole thing was live,
 so I sang each song five or six times when we actually put the tracks
 down in the first couple of weeks and that was it, it was done,
 so I was blown away. 


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: The triple axe attack of Dave Murray, Janick Gers and
                 Adrian Smith is sounding good too.@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: We call them 'The Three Amigos' and The Three Amigos did
 a terrific job! Basically, I don't think you could really assemble an ego
 between the three of them in terms of an adverse ego, they were all
 incredibly collaborative and we never really noticed that there was
 an issue about people having a different guitar parts or arguing about
 solos, because they would just go off into a huddle in the corner and
 15 minutes later, they'd reappear and go, "We've fixed it all up - he's
 doing this, he's doing this and I'm doing this", and off they'd go and
 do it. There was a lot of very smart guitar thinking. Between Dave and
 Adrian and Janick, there's three very, very clever guitarheads.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: Was 'Brave New World' an easy album to record?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: It was the easiest Iron Maiden album I've ever recorded.
 It was probably one of the easiest albums I've ever recorded full stop,
 because it was all done live, so all we had to do was go in and just do it.
 In fact, the worst part about it was sitting on our asses, waiting for all
 the performances that we'd done to be run through the microscope and
 assessed and graded and put in their proper positions in the order of life
 on the record, because that's quite time-consuming. We can rattle off
 performances one every five minutes and in a day, the band has done enough
 work to keep the producer busy for a week and I suppose that that was the
 bit that me and Janick found frustrating, because we wanted to be in there,
 getting on with it. After five weeks, when I went back in to say, "Okay,
 what do I have to do on my lead vocals?" and I was all geared up for a week
 of pain and suffering and headaches, Kevin (Shirley, producer) just said,
 "No, you're done." And I was. I think I had to sing two words and maybe
 four lines of a chunk that I hadn't sung originally, and that was it.
 It was strangely anti-climactic after all the work we put in on the
 pre-production. 

 We rehearsed the songs like we were going to go and do a gig with them and
 then basically we went into the studio and did a gig, but in the studio.
 Kevin has a unique way of putting together the sound in the recording
 process. Effectively, he has a monitoring set-up that he brings with him
 which enables each member of the band to have their own eight channel
 mixer, so they control completely their own environment and you get
 exactly what you need to give a great live performance. For me, it was
 just a dream. I could really sing and let rip and of course, my voice had
 just come from doing all the rehearsals in Antwerp, so it was in really
 shape, it was fit and really strong. It was great.


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: So Kevin had a major role in making this album easy
                 to record?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Yes, he did. We couldn't have made this record without
 him - no question. 


@{b} VALERIE POTTER: You now have an incredibly long tour in front of you,
                 stretching out until the end of the year. Are you looking
                 forward to that?@{ub}

 BRUCE DICKINSON: Yeah. It's two months around Europe and then we have a few
 days before we do America. Then it's these big dates in America and then
 we've got a few days before we go down to Australia and New Zealand, and
 I'm doing backflips over the idea of playing down there in Oz, 'cause it's
 such a fantastic place, and we have a week's break at the end of that,
 so we can just chill out and investigate Gods Own Country. Then it's into
 Japan for two weeks, which is always a blast, and then it's back to South
 America. As I go through it in my head and I look at all the places we're
 going and I think of what we're going to do, it's really bloody exciting,
 you know? So I can't honestly say that I'm not looking forward to any
 part of it.
