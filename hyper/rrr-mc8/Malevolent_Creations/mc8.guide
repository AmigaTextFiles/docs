    We take absolutely no responsibility whatever the buttons below may
 cause to your health, sanity, grandma or something else, if you press 'em.
    If you are not interested in your life as it is now, just go ahead.
                    You will never be the same. Never.

                           YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Change Me " system "data/0a.dat data/81.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Dark gods from the pitch black pits of space and time have allowed
 this species to develop beyond their natural limitations. To spare
 us all from the mind-wrecking madness JIP has left out the final
 vision, which is the true climax of this evolution... For the
 creatures rise into the heavens only to be eaten alive by the
 malignous Ancient Ones...
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" GhostBusters-Busters " system "data/0a.dat data/82.dat blank reltime 5"}

 When we watched those sinister ghostbusters movies, did we not all weep?
 For the movies were so sad and the cute little ghosties always pulled
 the shortest straw. But winds do change. And after this rightful
 revenge... ghostbusters and humanity... will remain no more!
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Liberatio " system "data/0a.dat data/83.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Straight from the crumbled pages of the Pnakotic Manuscripts,
 this vision shows how you are simply nothing. Just a fart in
 the thoughts of the Ones Above. Nor even they are worth a dime,
 for there always exists beings more sinister and evil...
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Nastamuumio " system "data/0a.dat data/84.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Neatmummies cause havoc in the Ancient Egypt, by dropping disease-
 inflicting drawing pins into the ground. Just try to come and steal
 their mortal wealth, and you will face the horrors unending.
 And I can assure you, those pins are still there, buried in the sand...
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Pomppivat Kalat " system "data/0a.dat data/85.dat blank reltime 6"}

 Deep down, under the waters which not many a man has seen,
 dwell the Squamous Things. Developed in the dark depths unknown...
 These fishy creatures know no Law Of the Fish
 these little critters swim and dance as they wish.

 If ever does a human enter the abyss in a sunken ship, much partying
 will be done and their meals will be of extraordinary delight.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Rock Show " system "data/0a.dat data/86.dat blank reltime 6"}

 The awful Bloogz in their trees are awaiting for human prey.
 The heartattacks and the nightly deaths in our world are no more
 than a Bloogz cathing your dream self in this twisted dimension.
 But be no anguished, for your pitiful life is meaningless compared
 to the nourishing dinner of some happy Bloogz.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sorry, no bonus (buaaa).
