 @{b}Breakaway [#1]@{ub} (1974)
 
 September 9th, 1999. John Koenig arrives at Moonbase Alpha to supervise a
 manned probe mission to the newly discovered planet Meta. Nine astronauts have
 been killed by a mysterious illness and Helena Russell is convinced that
 radiation is the cause.
 
 An investigation of the Moon's nuclear waste disposal areas reveals no sign of
 radiation leakage but intense heat is registered and Victor Bergman suggests
 that increased magnetic output is the real threat. One of the nuclear waste
 areas explodes and the only way to avert a major disaster is to disperse the
 remaining nuclear waste canisters, but a sudden increase in magnetic radiation
 sets off a chain reaction which alters the Moon's gravitational field and
 throws the satellite out of Earth orbit.

 A Kaldorian spaceship en route to Earth crashes on the Moon and the Alphans
 find a crew of six on board in suspended animation. Their attempt to revive
 the crew accidentally kills one, but the surviving Kaldorians are
 understanding and a peaceful cultural exchange takes place.
 
 Koenig proposes that one Alphan could accompany the Kaldorians to Earth in the
 now vacant casket, and Zantor agrees to the plan, stipulating that the chosen
 Alphan will have to be tested for compatibility with the Kaldorian suspended
 animation technology. The computer is set the task of choosing the one person
 who will return home, but Simmonds takes matters into his own hands, breaking
 into the power station and threatening to destroy Alpha unless he becomes the
 Kaldorians passenger.

 An Eagle returns from a reconnaissance flight to the planet Terra Nova with
 the pilots catatonic and an extra man on board. Helena identifies him as her
 husband, the pilot of Astro 7 lost in the vicinity of Jupiter in 1994.
 
 However, examination of Russell shows peculiarities in his life signs and
 Bergman determines that he is gradually turning into anti-matter. In obvious
 distress, Lee Russell warns the Alphans to stay away from the planet, but is
 unable to explain why. Inexplicably, the man dies and his body disappears.
 Disregarding Russell's warnings, Koenig and Helena lead a landing party to
 Terra Nova where they find a paradise environment, perfect for the Alphans.
 But disaster strikes when the planet apparently turns against them.

 @{b}Black Sun [#4]@{ub} (1974)
 
 The Moon is drawn inexorably towards a black sun, an area of intense
 gravitational pull that is the remains of a collapsed stellar mass. A
 reconnaissance Eagle is torn apart by the phenomenon and Koenig estimates
 that the Alphans have only three days before they suffer the same fate.
 
 Bergman designs a force shield which offers a slim chance for those on the
 base but Koenig also elects to launch a survival Eagle with a crew of six, in
 the hope that they might escape the pull of the sun and find a planet to live
 on. As the Moon plunges into the sun, Koenig and Bergman become discorporeal
 and meet an omnipotent being who reveals the secrets of the universe.

 Maintenance engineer Ted Clifford is struck by an energy beam which transforms
 his brain into a computer relay station for an alien probe which captures the
 Moon within an energy ring. When Clifford's mind burns out, the probe seeks a
 new relay and a medical mission on the lunar surface provides it with the
 opportunity to capture Helena Russell.
 
 She later returns to Alpha, apparantly unharmed, but is revealed to be
 relaying information from the Alpha computer through an energy implant in
 her brain. In an attempt to free Helena from the probe's control before she
 suffers the same fate as Clifford, Koenig and Carter board the probe and
 discover that the computerised device is on a pre-programmed mission to
 destroy the human race.

 The Moon passes through a rift in space and Regina Kesslann is badly effected
 by the experience. She develops the symptoms of sunburn and suffers an
 emotional breakdown when she discovers that John Koenig and Alan Carter are
 still alive - particularly Carter, to whom she believes she is married.
 
 Incredibly, the Moon returns to Earth, but an identical Moon is already in the
 planets orbit. Regina dies suddenly and an autopsy reveals that she has two
 brains. Koenig and Carter visit the doppelganger Moon where they find an
 abandoned Moonbase Alpha and a crashed Eagle with their own bodies at the

 Koenig is critically injured when his Eagle crashes on the lunar surface.
 Apparently in a coma and relying on life-support to sustain him, Koenig awakes
 to find himself transported to a city of light on the planet Zenno where Raan,
 an alien scientist, believes him to be the missing link of the loveless
 Zennite people.
 
 Initially reticent to comply with Raan's experiments, Koenig is seduced by the
 scientist's beautiful daughter Vana, and begins to have second thoughts of
 returning to Alpha, opting for a peaceful, immortal existence on Zenno, free
 at last of the constant fight for survival. Back on Alpha, however, Koenig's
 body is dying and the command structure is breaking down - without Koenig to
 lead the Alphans, the base is falling apart.

 A ball of blue light approaches Alpha and while the personnel are suspended in
 time, the light invades the body of technician Anton Zoref. Everything
 apparently returns to normal but massive energy losses are recorded and Koenig
 begins to suspect that Zoref may be the cause.
 
 Possessed with a consuming need for heat, Zoref draws it from any source,
 human or otherwise, as he rampages through the base leaving a trail of dead
 bodies and useless equipment in his wake. Koenig orders power supplies to be
 cut in an attempt to deprive Zoref of light and warmth, but Zoref heads for

 Jackie suddenly grows into a mature adult, revealing himself to be Jarak, one

 The Alphans enjoy their new-found freedom on the lunar surface and Helena

 but their Eagle is caught in a violent storm and crashes, stranding them miles

 Alpha encounters Voyager One, an Earth probe ship launched in 1985. Due to a
 tragic miscalculation in the design of the ship's Queller Drive engine,
 Voyager has spent the last fifteen years polluting space with toxic fast
 neutrons which will destroy Alpha unless the Drive can be shut down.
 
 Koenig turns to Ernst Linden to come up with a scheme to override the probe's
 security codes and deactivate the Queller Drive, and Linden confesses that he
 is the only man capable of doing so, for he is really Ernst Queller, designer
 of the fatal drive unit. Linden successfully shuts down the probe's engine but
 then a greater menace appears in the form of three Sidon spacecraft, seeking
 revenge for the destruction that Voyager One has wrought upon their worlds.

 Eagle Six returns to Alpha after a reconnaissance mission to the planet Retha,
 but the crew are missing and the only occupant is a dead cave man. Koenig and
 Helena lead a rescue team to the planet but they too go missing. Carter is
 attacked by primitive humans and Sandra is kidnapped and taken to the
 primitives' cave dwelling where the cave chief takes an interest in her.
 
 As a fight breaks out over her, Sandra realises with horror that the chief and
 his mate are Koenig and Helena, somehow regressed to a primitive Cro Magnon
 state. She smashes a rock on the chief's head and escapes into the woods,
 pursued by the primatives. Discovering the cave dwelling, Bergman, Kano and
 Carter disturb a ceremony for the injured cave chief. The cave people scatter
 and Carter gives chase, unaware that the primitives he intends to shoot down
 to rescue Sandra are his Alphan colleagues.

 Investigating a passing asteroid which appears to have an internal atmosphere,
 the Alphans blast their way into a living chamber inside. The explosion
 critically injures the only occupant who is returned to Alpha even though
 Helena feels that he cannot be saved. However, the alien makes a miraculous
 recovery and introduces himself as Balor, a Progron scientist who has achieved
 immortality. Unfortunately, Balor is also a dangerous psychopath who lives for
 the pleasure of inflicting fear and pain.
 
 He requests that Koenig allow him free reign to terrorise the Alphans,
 promising to use his powers of regeneration to keep them alive indefinately
 for his eternal amusement, but Koenig refuses so Balor embarks on a rampage
 of death and destruction.

 Alpha is approached by a fleet of Mark 9 Hawk Warships and, believing them to
 be about to attack the base, Koenig orders the Eagles to open fire. Suddenly,
 the Alphans are fighting a war against alien forces that devastate the base
 leaving it uninhabitable. With 128 dead, Koenig's only hope for his people is

 When the Moon falls into an orbit that places it directly between two planets
 on opposing sides of their sun, a huge spacecraft from the planet Betha takes
 up a position on the Moon and begins to launch an offensive on the other
 planet, Delta. The Alphans soon realise that the two planets are at war, and
 that their relative positions make it impossible for them to fire directly at

 Missiles from Delta apparently destroy the Bethan craft, but an escape vehicle
 makes its way to Alpha and the occupant, the Bethan commander Dione, seeks

 While attempting to communicate telepathically with his plants, botanist Dan
 Mateo collapses and a strange force sweeps through the base. Investigating,
 Koenig learns that Mateo believes that man has some affinity with plants, an
 affinity that can be exploited by tapping into certain wave patterns in the
 human brain that are identical to those generated by plant life.
 
 Mateo quickly recovers, but is forbidden from conducting any further
 experiments by hydroponics head Warren. A heated argument ensues and later
 Warren is confronted by a horribly scarred ghost figure that oddly resembles

 Alpha is visited by Taybor, an itinerant trader from Pinvith the Lesser, who
 lands on the Moon in his jump-drive spaceship, the Emporium. Unfortunately,
 his gifts - intended to illustrate his good will - have proven to be too
 advanced for the Alphans, blinding a hydroponics assistant and sending a
 technician into a catatonic trance, but Taybor assures Helena that neither
 is permanently harmed.
 
 Koenig is interested in the Emporium's jump drive which could return the
 Alphans to Earth and Taybor is willing to trade. Koenig offers him Moonbase
 Alpha with fixtures and fittings intact but Taybor has designs on Maya,
 intending to add her to his collection of the galaxy's most beautiful objects.

 Koenig crashes Eagle Ten near the Nuclear Waste Domes and, dragged unconscious
 from the wreckage, he is hooked up to a cerebral wave machine in Medical
 Center. Incredibly, a Superswift arrives from Earth and the Alphans are
 reunited with their friends and relatives.
 
 However, two of the new arrivals exert some form of influence over a medical
 orderly who attempts to kill Koenig but he is rescued by Helena and Vincent.
 Koenig makes a complete recovery and is delighted to learn of the arrival of
 the Superswift, but when he joins the party in Command Center he sees the
 newcomers as hideous Plasma Aliens.

 While Koenig tries to convince Helena and Maya that he has not gone mad,
 Carter, Ehrlich and Bartlett apparently arrive back on Earth. In reality,
 however, the trio are being influenced by the Aliens to insert atomic fuel
 into the nuclear waste core.
 
 To find out why, Maya turns into one of the Aliens and learns that they thrive
 on radiation which has run out on their planet - now starving, they intend to
 feed on the intense radiation that will result from the detonation of the
 waste dumps.

 @{b}The Dorcons [#48]@{ub} (1976)
 
 The Dorcans have hounded the Psychons for centuries, stealing their brain
 stems to achieve immortality. Now, the Dorcon leader Archon sets his sights on
 Maya, threatening Alpha with destruction unless Koenig gives her up. Koenig
 refuses and Alpha is subjected to a devastating barrage by the Dorcons, whose
 use of a Meson Converter to transform matter and energy makes them invincible.
 
 Transporting to Alpha, Consul Varda captures Maya and takes her back to the
 Dorcon ship, but Koenig leaps into the transporter beam and, arriving on the
 ship, is immediately thrown into a cell. However, the prospect of the Archon's
 immortality displeases his heir Malic who enlists Koenig's aid in his
 treacherous plans.
