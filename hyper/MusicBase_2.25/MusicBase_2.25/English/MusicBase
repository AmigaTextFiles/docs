 I had made MB for private use, but I decided to  release it and let
 everyone  use  it. I  had used many  different sources  to  make MB
 (books, magazines, internet etc.). Next version will be released as
 soon as I get 50 new  English and 50 new Polish lyrics. If you want
 to see  it soon,  send me  some texts.  All kinds of lyrics will be
 accepted  (even your own band) except  nazi, country and disco polo
 (Polish kind of disco :). @{"Here" link AboutAuthor} is my address.

 Please, do not understand  that work as a  breaking of a copyright law.
 I only want to  appreciate  my hard work (if you don't believe - try to
 do it yourself..:-). MB  is mailware,  so if you  use it often  please,
 send  me a mail, letter or postcard. Of course I'll ge glad to see some
 money but you don't have to do that - it's not a shareware.

 You are not allowed to make any changes in guide.  If you find anything
 to correct - let me know and I'll do that.

 All suggestions, infos, greetings send to address in chapter @{"about author" link AboutAuthor}.

@node instruction "Instruction"
 It's as easy as fitting Amiga in Micronic tower 8-).

 First, you  have  to  choose  language  (Polish or English), then band
 and song. That's all.

 All lyrics contain also:
 - name of the performer
 - title of the song
 - title of the album
 - names, surname or nick of a person, who sent that text.

 Misterious number you can find there, is a number of version of MB with
 that lyrics appearing for the first time. You can also find the list of
 all songs in text file  "Index".  In "data"  drawer you  can find files
 with texts of all bands. You can view it separately without running MB.
 Simply load it into any guide viewer.

 Option "Search"  in  menu  are  available  only  when the "SearchGuide"
