I'm ready
Ready for the laughing gas
I'm ready
Ready for what's next
Ready to duck
Ready to dive
Ready to say
I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready
Ready for the push

In the cool of the night
In the warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling around
On my hands and knees

She's just down the line... Zoo Station
Got to make it on time... Zoo Station

I'm ready
Ready for the gridlock
I'm ready
To take it to the street
Ready for the shuffle
Ready for the deal
Ready to let go
Of the steering wheel
I'm ready
Ready for the crush

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
It's alright... It's alright... It's alright... It's alright
Hey baby... hey baby... hey baby... hey baby
It's alright
It's alright

Time is a train
Makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass

I'm just down the line from your love... Zoo Station
Under the sign of your love... Zoo Station
I'm gonna be there... Zoo Station
Tracing the line... Zoo Station
I'm gonna make it on time... make it on time... Zoo Station
Just two stops down the line... Zoo Station
Just a stop down the line... Zoo Station

And you'll be satisfied
Give me two more chances
You won't be denied

Well my heart is where it's always been
My head is somewhere in between
Give me one more chance
Let me be your lover tonight

You're the real thing
Yeah the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing

Give me one last chance
And I'm gonna make you sing
Give me half a chance
To ride on the waves that you bring

You're honey child to a swarm of bees
Gonna blow right through you like a breeze
Give me one last chance
We'll slide down the surface of things

You're the real thing
Yeah the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing

We're free to fly the crimson sky
The sun won't melt our wings tonight

Oh now

Take me higher
Take me higher
Can you take me higher?
Will you take me higher?

You're the real thing

Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame

You say
One love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
One love
We get to share it
It leaves you baby
If you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one
But we're not the same
We get the carry each other
Carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much
More than a lot
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got
We're one
But we're not the same
We hurt each other
Then we do it again

You say
Love is a temple
Love a higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law
You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You got to do what you should

One life
With each other
Sisters
Brothers

One life
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other

Haven't seen you in quite a while
I was down the hold, just passing time
Last time we met it was a low-til room
We were as close together as bride and groom
We ate the food, we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time
Except you
You were talking about the end of the world

I took the money, I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You led me on with those innocent eyes
And you know I love the element of suprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed you lips and broke your heart
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world

In my dream I was drowning my sorrows
But my sorrows they learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
In waves of regret, waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You, you said you'd wait until the end of the world

Well you left my heart
Empty as a vacant lot
For any spirit to haunt

Hey hey sha la la

You're an accident
Waiting to happen
You're a piece of glass
Left there on the beach
Well you tell me things
I know you're not supposed to
Then you leave me
Just out of reach

Well you stole it
'Cos I needed the cash
And you killed it

The deeper I spin
The hunter will sin ... for your ivory skin ...
Took a drive in the dirty rain
To a place where the wind calls your name
Under the trees the river laughing
At you and me ...
Halluijah, heavens white rose
The doors you open
I just can't close

Don't turn around
Don't turn around
Don't turn around
Your gypsy heart
Don't turn around
Don't turn around again
Don't turn around
And don't look back
Come on now love
Don't you look back

Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses?

Who's gonna tame the heart of thee?

Who pushed who over?
It doesn't matter to you
It matters to me
     
We're cut adrift
But still floating
I'm only hanging on
To watch you go down...my love
     
I disappeared in you
You disappeared from me
I gave you everything you ever wanted
It wasn't what you wanted
     
The men who love you, you hate the most
They pass through you like a ghost
They look for you but your spirit is in the air
Baby...you're nowhere

You say in love there are no rules
Sweetheart
You're so cruel
     
Desparation is a tender trap
It gets you every time
You put your lips to her lips
To stop the lie
     
Her skin is pale like God's only dove
Screams like an angel for your love
Then she makes you watch her from above
And you need her like a drug

You say in love there are no rules
Sweetheart
You're so cruel
  
She wears my love
Like a see-through dress
Her lips say one thing
Her movements something else
Oh love
Like a screaming flower
Love
Dying every hour
     
And you don't know if it's fear or desire
Danger of a drug that takes you higher?
Head of heaven
Fingers in the mire
     
Her heart is racing... you can't keep up
The night is bleeding like a cut
Between the horses of love and lust
In a trampled underfoot     
    
You say in love there are no rules
Sweetheart
You're so cruel
     
To stay with you I'd be a fool
Sweetheart
You're so cruel.

Let her pale light in 
To fill up your room
You've been living underground
Eating from a can
You've been running away
From what you don't understand
    
She's slippy
Your're sliding down
She'll be there
When you hit the ground

Let her talk about the things
You can't explain
To touch is to heal
To hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky
Better learn how to kneel (...on your knees boy!)
    
She's the wave
She turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child

It's alright...it's alright...it's alright

One day you'll look back
And you'll see
Where
You were held how
By this love
While
You could stand
There
And not move on this moment
Follow this feeling
    
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright...it's alright...it's alright
We move through miracle days
Spirit moves in mysterious ways
She woves with it

You've been falling off the sidewalk

Tryin' to throw your arms around the world

Before you lose your way back home?

I'm gonna run to you...run to you...woman be still
I'm gonna run to you...run to you...woman I will

He was trying to throw his arms around a girl
He took an open top beetle

There is a silence that comes to a house
Where no one can sleep
I guess it's the price of love
I know it's not cheap

You had fire in your soul
What happened your face
Of melting in snow?

You can throw it up
Or choke on it
And you can dream
So dream out loud
You know that your time is coming 'round

Nothing seems to fit
I know you'd hit out
If you only knew who to hit

And I'd join the movement
If there was one I could believe in
Yeah I'd break bread and wine
If there was a church I could receive in
'Cos I need it now

To take a cup
To fill it up
To drink it slow
I Can't let you go

And I must be

To talk like this
And act like that
And you can dream

No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read

And I must be

To talk like this
And act like that
And you can dream
So dream out loud
And you can find
Your own way out
You can build
And I can will
And you can call
I can't wait until
You can stash
And you can seize
In dreams begin
Responsibilities
And I can love
And I can love
I know that the tide is turning 'round

Take my heart
Love is blindness

You see your love
Made complete
Thread is ripping

And cold steel
Fingers to numb to feel
Squeeze the handle
Blow out the candle
Love is blindness

Love is blindness

Oh my love
Blindness
     
A little death
Without mourning
No call

And when I go there

And our love turns to rust

In the howling wind comes a stinging rain
See it driving nails into souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly, a red orange glow
See the face of fear running scared in the valley below

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel and the angel was overcome
Plant a demon seed, you raise a flower of fire
See them burning crosses, see the flames, higher and higher

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

This guy comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colors of a royal flush
And he's peeling off those dollar bills
Slapping them down
One hundred, two hundred
And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
Take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into a saxophone
Through the walls we hear the city groan
Outside it's America
Outside it's America

Across the field you see the sky ripped open
See the rain come through the gaping wound
Pounding on the women and children who run into the arms of America

And so she woke up
From where she was lying still
Said we got to do something about where we're going
Step on a steam train
Step out of the driving train
Maybe run from the darkness in the night
Singing Ha La La La De Day
Singing Ha La La La De Day
Sweet the sin
But the bitter taste in my mouth
I see seven towers
But I only see one way out
You got to cry without weeping
Talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice, you know
I took the poison, from the poison stream,
Then I floated out of here
Singing Ha La La La De Day
Singing Ha La La La De Day
She runs through the streets
With her eyes painted red
Under black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway she brings me
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea
She is raging
She is raging and the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She is running to stand still

From Father to Son
The blood runs thin
Our faces frozen (still) against the wind
The seam is split
The coal face cracked
The lines are long
And there's no going back
Through hands of steel
And a heart of stone
Our labor day has come and gone
And you leave us holding on
In Red Hill Town
As the lights go down
I'm hanging on
You're all that's left to hang on to
I'm holding on
You're all that's left to hang on to

The glass is cut
The bottle runs dry
Our love runs cold
In the caverns of the night
We're wounded by fear
Injured in doubt
I can lose myself
I'm holding on
You're all that's left to hold on to

And we scorch the earth
Set fire to the sky
Stoop so low to reach so high
A link is lost
The chain undone
Now we wait all day
For the night to come
And it comes
And it comes
Like a hunter (child)
I'm hanging on
You're all that's left to hang on to
I'm hanging on to
You're all that's left to hang on to
We see love slowly stripped away
Our love, has seen a better day
I'm hanging on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm holding on
You're all that's left to hold on to
See the lights go down on Red Hill Town
See lights go down on Red Hill Town

Desert sky
Dream beneath a desert sky
The rivers run
But soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight
Desert rose
Dreamed I saw a desert rose
Dress torn in ribbons
And in bows
Like a siren she calls (to me)
Sleep comes like a drug...In God's Country
Sad eyes crooked crosses...In God's Country
Set me alight
We'll punch a hole right through the night
Everyday the dreamers die
She is Liberty
And she comes to rescue me
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold
Sleep comes like a drug...In God's Country
Sad eyes crooked crosses...In God's Country
Naked flame
She stands with a naked flame
I stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love

In the distance
She saw me coming
I was calling out
I was calling out

Still shaking
Still in pain
Angel or devil
I was thirsty
And you wet my lips

You, I'm waiting for you
You, you set my desire
I trip through your wires

I was broken, bent out of shape
I was naked in the clothes you made
My lips were dry, throat like rust
You gave me shelter
>From the heat and the dust
There's no more water in the well
No more water in the well

Angel or devil
I was thirsty and you wet my lips

You, I'm waiting for you
You, You set my desire

I trip through your wires
Thunder, thunder on the mountain
There's a rain cloud in the desert sky
In the distance you saw me coming
I was calling out
I was calling out

We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill
As the day begs the night for mercy
Your sun so bright it leaves no shadows, only scars
Carved into stone on the face of earth
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill
We see the sun go down in your eyes
You ran like river to the sea
Like a river to the sea
And in our world a heart of darkness, a firezone
Where poets speak their hearts, then bleed for it
Jara sang, his song a weapon, in the hands of love
You know his blood still cries from the ground
It runs like a river to the sea
Like a river to the sea
I don't believe in painted roses or bleeding hearts
While bullets rape the night of the merciful
I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky
And the moon has turned red over One Tree Hill
We run like a river to the sea
Like a river to the sea

You know he got the cure...but then he went astray,
He used to stay awake
To drive the dreams he had away
He wanted to believe
In the hands of love...

His head it felt heavy
As he cut across the land
He went deeper into black
Deeper into white...he could see
The stars shine
Like nails in the night
He felt the healing
Healing, healing, healing
Hands of love
Like the stars shiny, shiny...
>From above.

He put his hands in the pocket
His finger on the steel
The pistol weighed heavy
His heart he could feel
Was beating, beating
Beating, beating oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love.

He saw the hands that build
Could also pull down....
The hands of love.

Midnight, our sons and daughters
Were cut down and taken from us
Hear their heartbeat...
We hear their heartbeat
In the wind
We hear their laughter
In the rain
We see their tears
Hear their heartbeat...
We hear their heartbeat
Night hangs like a prisoner
Stretched over black and blue
Hear their heartbeat...
We hear their heartbeat
In the trees
Our sons stand naked
Through the walls
Our daughters cry
See their tears in the rainfall
