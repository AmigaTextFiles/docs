What will you do when you get lonely
With nobody waiting by your side
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

Tried to give you consolation
Your old man won't let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
Turned the whole world upside down

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

Let's make the best of the situation
Before I fin'lly go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
And tell me all my loves in vain

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging darling please
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven
I must be strong and carry on
'Cos I now I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven
I'll find my way
Through night and day
'Cos I know
I just can't stand stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please
Begging please

Beyond the door
There's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be
No more tears in heaven

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would you be the same
If I saw you in heaven
'Cos I know I don't belong
Here in heaven
