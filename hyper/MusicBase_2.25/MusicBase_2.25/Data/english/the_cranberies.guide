Understand the things I say.
Don't turn away from me.
'Cause I spent half my life out there.
You wouldn't disagree.
D'you see me, d'you see?
Do you like me?
Do you like me standing there?
D'you notice, d'you know?
Do you see me, do you see me?
Does anyone care?
Unhappiness, where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn.
'Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can.
My mother, my mother she hold me.
Did she hold me when I was out there?
My father, my father, he liked me,
Oh, he liked me. Does anyone care?
Understand what I've become.
It wasn't my design.
And people everywhere
Think something better than I am.
But I miss you, I miss,
'Cause I liked it, I liked it When I was out there.
Do you know this, do you know?
You did not find me, you did not find.
Does anyone care?
Unhappiness, was when I was young

Lying in my bed again
And I cry cause you're not here.
Crying in my head again
And I know that it's not clear.
Put you hands, put your hands
Inside my face and see that it's just you.
But it's bad and it's mad
And it's making me sad
Because I can't be with you.
Be with you (x6)
Baby I can't be with you.
Thinking back on how things were,
And on how we loved so well.
I wanted to be the mother of your child,
And now it's just farewell.
Put you hands in my hands
And come with me.
We'll find another end.
And my head, and my head
On anyone's shoulder.
'Cause I can't be with you.
Be with you (x6)
Baby I can't be with you.

Child is slowly taken.
And the violence caused such silence.
Who are we mistaken.
But you see it's not me,
It's not my family.

They are fighting.
With there tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns.

Heart is taken over.

We must be mistaken.
It's the same old theme
Since 1916.

They're still fighting.

They are dying.

And I don't know where it went to.
Somebody caused me strife
And it's not what I was seeking.
Didn't you see me, didn't you hear me?
Didn't you see me standing there.
Why did you turn out the lights?
Did you know that I was sleeping?
Say I prayer for me.
Help me to feel the strength I did.

Silence by death in the grave.
William Butler Yeats couldn't save.
Why did you stand here?
Were you sickened in time?
But I know by now,
Why did you sit here in the grave?
In the grave.
In the grave.
In the grave.
"Why should I blame her,
That she filled my days
With misery, or that she would of late, Have taught to
ignorant men most violent ways, Or hurled the little streets
upon the great, Had they but courage
Equal to desire."
Sad that Maud Gonne couldn't stay,
But she had Mac Bride anyway.
And you sit here with me
On the Isle Innisfree
And you're writing down everything.
But I know by now,
Why did you sit here in the grave?
In the grave.
In the grave.
In the grave.
"Why should I blame her,
Had they but courage equal to desire."

There's no need to argue anymore.
I gave all I could, but it left me so sore.
And the thing that makes me mad
Is the one thing that I had.
I knew, I knew I'd lose you.
You'll always be special to me, special to me, to me.
And I remember all the things we once shared.
Watching TV movies on the living room armchair.
But they say it will work out fine.

He's 18 years old and well,
I fell in love
Where have you gone from me?
The one that I loved endlessly
We used to have a life
Now it's all gone
Mystified, mystified, mystified
Does it have to be so cold in Ireland?

Look what they've done to me
