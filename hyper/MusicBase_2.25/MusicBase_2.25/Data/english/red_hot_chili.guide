On the city streets, I got the tunes in my pocket
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots
While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not
I've got no time to flick and talk
But this baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shakin' and a kickin' and that did a bit of tot
Her pop said no, but I just couldn't stop
The killer had a case of tod the rock

But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal

We stop the fire, we quench the heat
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street
'cos that's when in the store when who do we meet?
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat
Five thousand babies walkin' out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight for me and golly gee wizz!
I just can't tell ya how much we did
Rockin' right out for those itty bitty girls, right out

But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Peppers have baby appeal

Jump for joy
Just don't stop jumpin'
Keep your heart muscle pumpin'
Hillel be jumpin' on that little baby frumpkin
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants?

When you're just standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs gettin' a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
Don't you know they're jumpin' foos, jump you!

Jump a nun
Jump a Jack
Jump  for fun
Jump back
How's about us jumpin' in the sack?
And now, it's time for a jump attack

Get up and jump (X8)

Lookin' like you're mighty silly

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shue
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me
Somebody changed, so lemme give you a clue

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue

About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow

Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'Cos everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?

Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at them with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you

Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the american tradition
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?

We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A.

L.A. is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton pickin' maze

The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Like a come on a thumb
Poppin' hump, hump, hump, pop out

The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
'Cos I'm shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop
But he never met the Tree so he never be-bopped out hop!

Antwan the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat
And between his legs was a sweat young lass

He threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love 'em all
By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop
Because that's when he thought that he heard a phone

Last night and the night before, I heard a
Fop outside, then I came in doors
Freak out!

Now that I told you a little something about the Flea
A little something about the Tree, a little something about me
I can't leave you hangin' but my man Shermzy, he swings the yang, he bangs the
yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his playin', you better be burning Sherman!

We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A.
