Love is a stranger
In an open car
To tempt you in
And drive you far away
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
Love is a danger
Of a different kind
To take you away
And leave you far behind
And love love love
Is a dangerous drug
You have to receive it
And you still can't
Get enough of the stuff
It's savage and it's cruel
And it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood
And it seems like religion
It's noble and it's brutal
It distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up
And you're left like a zombie
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
It's guilt edged
Glamorous and sleek by design
You know it's jealous by nature
False and unkind
It's hard and restrained
And it's totally cool
It touches and it teases
As you stumble in the debris
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

I've got an angel

Goes right to my head

I've been watching you for days now baby

You now my love will never stop now baby
Just put your loving in my box baby
Wrap it up - I'll take it
No more will I shop around baby
You know I've got the best thing in town now baby
I've seen all I wanna see baby
What your loving means to me now baby
Wrap it up - I'll take it
I'm gonna treat you like the queen you are
Give you sweet things from my candy jar
You've got treats you ain't ever used
Give it give it to me
It won't get abused

How can you be so cold
With my arms to hold you?
How can you be so cold
With my arms to enfold you?
I could give you - A mirror
To show you - Dissappointments

I could give you - A history
Could you ever listen in to me?
How can you be so cold
When there's a fire burning?
How can you be so cold
When all the ice is melting?
I could give you - A mirror
To show you - Dissappointments
I could give you - A history
Could you ever listen in to me?

I could be contended
I don't need to suffer
You're beautiful
Good to talk to
You make an impression
To take my attention
And when you touch my skin
I smell disaster
Step away - walk away
All I want is the real thing
(nothing but the real thing)
Walking on pavements
We collect in bars
Asleep in the houses
So alone -
Looking inside herself
She breaks the glass
Turns her head backwards
She's fallen down again

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas--
Everybody's looking for something.
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused.

This is the house
This is the hill
This is the story - it's a little thing
A lock of hair
An invisible smoke trail
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
oh/oh/oh everything changes
This is your picture (it's in black and white)
This is the family having a party
There's a crack in the ceiling
And there's an open door
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
oh/oh/oh everything changes

Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Something about you
I didn't believe it
I couldn't believe it
I'm still reeling
'cause I just can't take the blow
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Full of forgiveness
You're just twisted
I'm a silly little saint
With a halo of smiles
But it makes no difference

You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder
You know there's so many people
Living in this house
And don't even know their names
I guess it's just a feeling - in the city)
Walls so thin I can almost
Hear them breathing
And if I listen in
I feel my own heart beating
(I guess it's just a feeling - in the city)
