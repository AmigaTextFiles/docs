I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up I can not see
That there's not much lef to me
Nothing is real but pain now!

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please God wake me!

Back in the womb it's much to real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed thourgh the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please God wake me!

Now that the war is through with me
Hold my breath as I  wish for death
Oh, please God  wake me!

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see absolute horror
I can not live
I can not die
Trapped in myself
Body my holdind cell!

Land mine has
Taken my sight  
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in

Liberty or death what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her rattling of her tail
Never begins it never, but once engaged...
Never surrenders showing the fangs of rage

Don't tread on me

So be it threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it settle the score
Touch me again for the words
That you'll hear everymore...

Don't tread on me

Love it or leave it she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue
Forked as the lighting strike
Shining with brightness always on surveillance
The eyes they never close emblem of vigilance

Don't tread on me

So be it threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it settle the score
Touch me again for the words

Say your prayers little one don't forget
My son to include everyone
Tuck you in warm within keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open gripping your pillow tight

Exit: light - Enter: night
Take my hand we're off to never never land

Something's wrong shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight and they aren't of snow white
Dreams of war dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire and of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open gripping your pillow tight

Exit: light - Enter: night
Take my hand we're off to never never land

Now I lie me down to sleep pray my Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed in your closet
In your head

Exit: light - Enter: night
Grain of sand
Exit: light - Enter: night
Take my hand we're off to never never land

No more!
The carp rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You You're smothered in tragedy
You're out to save the world

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You You'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Theresfore I am
Harvest the land
Taking off the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift - nose to the wind
Shape shift - feeling I've been
Move swift - all senses clean
Earth's gift - back to the meaning of life

Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill in the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

Shape shift - nose to the wind
Shape shift - feeling I've been
Move swift - all senses clean
Earth's gift - back to the meaning of life

I feel a change
Back to a better day
Hair stands on the back of my neck
In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift - nose to the wind
Shape shift - feeling I've been
Move swift - all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning of wolf and man

Not the word not the love not what you thought from above

It feeds it grows it clouds all that you will know
Deceit deceive decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries broken is the promise betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail

Follow the God that failed

Find your peace find your say find the smooth road on your way
Trust you gave a child to save left you cold and him in grave

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you thought was real

Kicking at a dead pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose

What the hell what is it you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite boredom sets into boring mind

Struggle within - It suits you fine
Struggle within - You ruin
Struggle within - You seal your own coffin
Struggle within - The struggling within

Home is not a home it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell

Reaching out grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in the pressure upon you is unreal

Struggle within - It suits you fine
Struggle within - You ruin
Struggle within - You seal your own coffin
Struggle within - The struggling within

New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules

With time the child draws
In this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's know
A vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've know never shined through
In what I've shown
Never be never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've know never shined through
In what I've shown
Never free never me
So I dub the unforgiven

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This better man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tried man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die
Regretfully that old man here is me

What I've felt
What I've know never shined through
In what I've shown
Never be never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've know never shined through

Never free never me

All that is was and will be
Universe much too big to see
Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts questions pending
Limitations of human understanding
To quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive

All that is ever ever was will be ever
Twisting turning through the never

In the dark see past our eyes pursuit
Of thruth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest meaning reason
Came to be how it begun all alone
In the family of the sun
Curiosity teasting everyone on our home
Third stone from the sun

All that is ever ever was will be ever
Twisting turning through the never

On through the never - we must go
On through the never out to the edge
Of forever - we must go
On through the never then never comes

All that is ever ever was will be ever
Who we are ask forever
Twisting turning through the never
Never

And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide and she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover - wanderer - nomad - vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
I roam where I lay my head is home

And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone I ask no one
And my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover - wanderer - nomad - vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind  anywhere anywhere I roam
