Hello is there anybody in there
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home
Come on now
I hear you are feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you are saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
O.K.
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it is working good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you are saying
When I was a child
I cought a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I can't put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
And I have become comfortably numb

Don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooooh Babe
Don't leave me now
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooooh Babe
Don't leave me now
How can you treat me this way
Running away
I need you Babe
Why are you running away?
Ooooh Babe!

Did you hear the falling bombs
Did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clean blue sky

Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooh

Did you hear the falling bombs
The flames are all long-gone
But the pain lingers on
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye

Hey you! Out there in the cold
Getting lonely getting old can you feel me

Hey you! Standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles can you feel me

Hey you! Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without fight

Hey you! Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone would you though me

Hey you! With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out would you tougch me

Hey you! Would you help me to carry the stone
Open your heart I'm coming home
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high as you can see
No matter how he tried he could not break free
And the worms are into his brain

Hey you! Out there on the road
Always doing what you've told can you help me

Hey you! Out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall can you help me

Hey you! Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand divided we fall

To feel the warm thrill of confusion

Tell me is something eluding you sunshine

Mother should I build a wall
Mother should I run for president
Mother should I thrust the goverment
Mother will they put me in the firing line
Mother am I realy dying
Hush now baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your
Nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here
Under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mama will keep baby cosy and worm
Ooooh Babe Ooooh Babe Ooooh Babe
Of course mam'll help build the wall
Mother do you think she's good enough for me
Mother do you think she's dangerous to me
Mother will she tear your little boy apart
Mother will she break my heart
Hush now baby baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all yourgirl-friends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up till out there
You've been
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

You'll always be a baby to me

I've got a little black book with my poems in
I've got a bag with a tooth-brush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
Got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home
I've the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to
Oooooh Babe when I pick up the phone
There's still nobody home
I've got a pair of Gohils boots
And I've got fading roots

Day after day love turns grey
Like the skin of the dying man
Night after night we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder and
Nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as funeral drum
Run to the bedroom in the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so freightened
This is just a passing phase
Just one of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplete the silent freeway?
Would you something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would you like to see me try?
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children anyway they could
By pluring they derison
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night their fat and
Psychopatic wives would trash them
Within inches of thier lives

I didn't mean to let my soul
Take away my soul

Mama loves her baby and daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you baby
And the sky may look blue
But Ooooooh baby Ooooooh baby blue Ooooooh baby
If you should go skating on the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice
