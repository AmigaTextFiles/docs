Do you mean this horny creep
Set upon weary feet
Who looks in need of sleep
That doesn't come
This twisted, tortured mess
This bed of sinfulness
Who's longing for some rest
And feeling numb

What do you expect of me
What is it you want
Whatever you've planned for me
I'm not the one

A vicious appetite
Visits me each night
And won't be satisfied
Won't be denied
An unbearable pain
A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of cain
Right here inside

What am I supposed to do
When everything that I've done
Is leading me to conclude
I'm not the one

Whatever I've done
I've been starting down the barrel of a gun

Is there something you need from me
Are you having your fun
I never agreed to be
You holy one

Whatever I've done
I've been starting down the barrel of a gun

Oh the tears that you weep
For the poor tortured souls
Who fall at your feet
With their love begging bowls
All the clerks and the tailors
The sharks and the sailors
All good at their traders
But they'll always be failures

Alms for the poor
For the wretched disciples
And the love that they swore
With their hearts on the bible
Beseeching the honour
To sit at your table
And feast on your holiness
As long as they're able

Lowe needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers

You're holding court
With your lips and your smile
Your body's a halo
Their minds are on trial
Sure as adam is eve
Sure as jonah turned whaler
They's crooked love thieves
And you are their jailor

Lowe needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers

Here is a song
From the wrong side of town
Where I'm bound
To the ground
By the loneliest sound
That pounds from within
And is pinning me down

Here is a page
From the emptiest stage
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the  deadliest trap ever laid

And I thand you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found
That I belong here

The heat and the sickliest
Sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees
And my feet
I'm drowning in time
To a desperate beat

And I thand you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found
That I belong
Feels like home
I should have know
From my first breath

God send the only true friend
I call mine
Pretend thet  I'll make amends
The next time
Befriend the glorious end of the line

And I thand you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found
That I belong here

I'm going to take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine
It is written in the stars above
The gods decree
You'll be right here by my side
Right next to me
You can run but you cannot hide

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood
Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
I know you can't be
'Cause it's no good

I'll be fine
I'll be wathing patiently
Till you see the signs
And come running to my open arms
When will you realise
Do we have to wait till our worlds collide
Open up your eyes
You can't turn back the tide

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood
Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
I know you can't be
'Cause it's no good

I'm going to take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine
It is written in the stars above
