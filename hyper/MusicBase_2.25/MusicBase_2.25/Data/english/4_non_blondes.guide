25 years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
for a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
that the world was made up of this
brotherhood of man
for whatever that means
so I cry somethimes when I'm lying in bed
to get it all out what's in my head
then I start feeling a little peculiar
so I wake in the morning and I step
outside I take deep breath
I get real high
then I scream from the top of my lungs
what's goin' on
and I say hey...
and I say hey what's goin' on
and I say hey...
I said hey what's goin' on
and I try, oh my God do I try
I try all the time
in this institution
and I pray, oh my God do I pray
I pray every single day
for a revolution
so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in my bed
to get it all out what's in my head
then I start feeling a little peculiar
so I wake in the morning and I step outside
I take a deep breaththen I get real high
then I scream from the top of my lungs
what's goin' on
and I say hey...
and I say hey what's goin' on
and I say hey...
I said hey what's goin' on
and I say hey...
and I say hey what's goin' on
and I say hey...
I said hey what's goin' on
25 years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
for a destination
