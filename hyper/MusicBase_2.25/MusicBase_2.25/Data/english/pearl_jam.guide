Son she said
Have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your Daddy
Was nothin' but a...

While you were sittin'
Home alone at age thirteen
Your real Daddy was dyin'
Sorry you didn't see him

But I'm glad we talked

I... I'm still alive

Ooh she walks slowly across a young man's room
She said I'm ready... for you
I can't remember anything to this very day
'Cept the look... the look
Now I can't see... I just stare

I... I... I'm still alive

Is something wrong she said
Of course there is
You're still alive she said
Do I deserve to be
Is that the quesion
And if so... If so...
Who answers? Who answers?

I... I... I'm still alive

Sheets of empty canvas under sheets of glass
Were laid spread out before me
As here body lay still
All five horizons revolved around her soul
As the earth with the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed
Was taken a turn

Ooh and all I taught her was... everything
Ooh i know she gave me all that she would
And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything

All the pictures said
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything

I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
So why do I see her?
And twisted thoughts that spin round my head
I'm spinning... I'm spinning
High up with the sun
Can't drop away
Now my bitter hands grade on broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures said

All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad

Turned my world too black
Tattooed all I see
All that I am all that I'll be yeah
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky
But why
Why
Why can't it be can't it be mine?

At home drawing pictures of mountain tops
With him on top
Lemon yellow sun arms raised in a V
Dead lay in pools of maroon below

Daddy didn't give attention
To the fact that Mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked rules his world

Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Clearly I remember picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
But we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recessed lady's breast

How could I forget
He hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurtin' dropped wide open
Just like the day like the day I heard

Daddy didn't give affection
And the boy was something Mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked ruled his world

Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today

Try to forget this...
Try to erase this...
From the blackboard

Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Guide me towards you
Know something's left
And we're all allowed to dream
Of the next time we touch...

You don't have to stray two ocean away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring...
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore...
I will be...
I will be...
There once more...

I admit it... what's to say
I'll relive it... without pain
Backstreet lover on the side of the road
I got a bomb in my temple
That is gonna explode
I got a 16 gauge buried under my clothes... I play

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself

Oh try and mimic what's insane
I am in it... where do I stand?
Indian summer I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket
So determined discreet... I pray

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself
Once upon a time I could love myself
Once upon a time I could love you
Once once once

She scratches a letter into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday another child
Won't feel as alone as she does

It's been two years and counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed by some stupid fuck
(And mommy agrees)
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home...

She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be is weak
She could just pretend
She could play the game
She could be another clone

Why go home?

What you taught me
Don't come visit
Put me here
Mommy dear

what the fuck is this world
running to?

you didn't leave a message
at least i could have
heard your voice one last time.

daily minefield
this could be my time
how 'bout you?
would you hit me?
would you hit me?

all the bills go by
and initiatives are taken up
by the middle
there ain't gonna be any middle any more

and the cross i'm bearing home
ain't indicative of my place
left the porch
left the porch

hear my name
take a good look
this could be the day
hold my hand
walk beside me
i just need to say...

hear my name
take a good look
this could be the day
hold my hand
lie beside me
i just need to say
what can i take? (?)
i just want to be
i know that i would not ever touch you
hold you
feel you
ever hold
never again

the direction of the eye
so misleading
the defection of the soul
nauseously quick

i don't question
our existence
i just question
our modern needs

i will walk...with my hands bound
i will walk...with my face blood
i will walk...with my shadow flag
into your garden
garden of stone

after all is done
we're still alone
i won't be taken
yet i'll go...

i will walk...with my hands bound
i will walk...with my face blood
i will walk...with my shadow flag
into your garden

i don't show...
i don't share...
i don't need

on the edge
windowsill
ponders his maker
ponders his will
to the street below
he just ain't nothin'
but he's got a great view...

on the edge
know-nothin' town
feelin' quite superior
the aged come
to the sky above
he just ain't nothin'
but he's got a great view...

on the edge of a
christmas clean love
young virgin from heaven
visiting...
to the man above her
she just ain't nothin'...
she doesn't like the view
doesn't like the view
doesn't like the view...
but he sinks himself deep.

can't touch the bottom
in too deep
can't touch the bottom

can't touch the bottom
in too deep
can't touch the bottom

can't touch the bottom
in too deep
can't touch the bottom
can't touch the bottom

feel the truth
which way to go
windowsill
i see the words
on a rocking horse of time
i see the birds in the rain

oh dear dad
can you see me now
i am myself
like you somehow
i'll ride the wave
where it takes me
i'll hold the pain
release me

oh dear dad
can you see me now
i am myself
like you somehow
i'll wait up in the dark
for you to speak to me
i'll open up
release me
release me
release me
