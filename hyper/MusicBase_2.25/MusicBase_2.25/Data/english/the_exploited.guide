Panic, all hell breaks loose
A battered body screams abuse
A plastic bullet ends his youth
A motherless son turns and pukes
 
Behind closed curtains
terror stares
 
What are they doing prowling round our streets
Who are they looking for with bullets in their breech
Screaming sriens fill the air
They turn off nowhere there's coppers everywhere
 
Behind closed curtains
terror stares
 
God saved the queen with blanks from a gun
But who is our protector when provoked to run
We still don't know why they surrounded the streets
But now they've withdrawn in full retreat
 
Behind closed curtains
terror stares
