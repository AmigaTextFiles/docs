I believe them bones are me
Some say we're born into the grave
I feel so alone, gonna end up a
Big ole pile a them bones
 
Dust rise right on over my time
Empty fossil of the new scene
I feel so alone, gonna wind up a
Big ole pile a them bones
 
Toll due bad dream come true
I lie dead gone under red sky
I feel so alone, gonna end up a
Big ole pile a them bones

I broke you in the canyon
I drowned you in the lake
You a snake that I would trample
Only thing I'd not embrace
 
Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away
 
I pushed and then you stumbled
I kicked you in the face
You stare at me so hollow
Got to keep that killin' pace
 
Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away
 
I burned the place around you
I hit you with a rake
You piss upon my candle
So proving you're a fake

Is she ready to know my frustration?
What she slippin' inside, slow castration
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me
Did she come here to try, try to take me
 
Did she call my name?
I think it's gonna rain
When I die
 
Was it something I said, held against me?
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing
I can help her but won't, now she hates me
 
She won't let me hide
She don't want me to cry
 
Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me
Could she love me again, or will she hate me
Prob'ly not, I know why, can't explain me

What the hell am I?
Thousand eyes, a fly
Lucky then I'd be
In one day deceased
 
Sickman, sickman, sickman
 
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear
 
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine
 
What the hell am I
Leper from inside
Inside wall of peace
Dirty and diseased
 
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman
 
I can see the end is getting near
I won't rest until my head is clear
 
Can you see the end?
Choke on me my friend
Must to drown these thoughts
Purity over rot
 
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair
With head high and eyes alert
I tread on a plane of many
 
We who are of good nature and intention,
But cannot touch on the dark
Recesses of memory
And pain learned, so come walk
With me, feel the pain,
And release it
 
What the hell am I worn eroded pride
Saddened 10 mile wide
I'm gonna let it slide
 
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman
 
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear
Ahh, etc., etc.

Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere
Wife and kids household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere
 
Here they come to snuff the rooster
Yeah here come the rooster
You know he ain't gonna die
 
Walkin' tall machine gun man
They spit on me in my home land
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathin' his dyin' breath
Oh god please won't you help me make it through

A good night, the best in a long time
A new friend turned me on to an old favorite
Nothing better than a dealer who's high
Be high, convince them to buy
 
What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot
 
Seems so sick to the hypocrite norm
Running their boring drills
But we are an elite race of our own
The stoners, junkies, and freaks
 
Are you happy? I am, man.
Content and fully aware
Money, status, nothing to me
'Cause your life is empty and bare
 
You can't understand a user's mind
But try, with your books and degrees
If you let yourself go and opened your mind
I'll bet you'd be doing like me
And it ain't so bad
 
Say, I do it a lot!
Say, I do it a lot!
Say, I do it a lot!
Say, I do it a lot!

I have never felt such frustration
Or lack of self control
I want you to kill me
And dig me under, I wanna live no more
 
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me
 
I want to taste dirty, stinging pistol
In my mouth, on my tongue
I want you to scrape me from the walls
And go crazy like you've made me
 
You, you are so special
You have the talent to 
Make me feel like dirt
And you, you use your
Talent to dig me under
And cover me with dirt

Care not for the men who wonder
Straw that broke your back, you're under
Cast all them aside who care
Empty eyes and dead end stare
 
Don't you know that none are blind
To the lie, and you think I don't find what you hide?
 
What in God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun
 
For the horse you've grown much fonder
Than for me, that I don't ponder
As the hair of one who bit you
Smiling bite your own self, too
 
And I think that you're not blind
To the ones you left behind
I'll be here
 
So be yearning all your life
Twisting, turning like a knife
 
Now you know the reasons why
Can't get high, or you will die
Or you'll die
 
So your sickness weighs a ton
And God's name is smack for some

What's gone wrong, I can't see straight
Been too long, so full of hate
 
What the fuck will it take
Drown myself in my wake
Another shaggy D.A.
Now a dog, shake my leg
Plastic man, paper face
Candy heart, what a waste
Gotta change, set a date
 
Stare at me with empty eyes and
Point your words at me
Mirror on the wall will show you
What you're scared to see
 
I can see, yeah - (wish I couldn't see at all)
I can feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see - (wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)
 
So climb the walls,
Thin my blood now
And I crawl, back to bed now
 
What the hell, gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
 
Little bug for a pet
New Orleans, gotta get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance
 
All this time I swore I'd never
Be like my old man
What the hay it's time to face
Exactly what I am

Sitting on an angry chair
Angry walls that steal the air
Stomach hurts and I don't care
 
What do I see across the way
See myself molded in clay
Stares at me, yeah I'm afraid
Changing the shape of his face
 
Candles red I have a pair
Shadows dancing everywhere
burning on the angry chair
 
Little boy made a mistake
Pink cloud has now turned to gray
All that I want is to play
Get on your knees, time to pray, boy
 
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I-I-I
I don't mind, yeah,
I don't mind, I-I-I
Lost my mind, yeah
But I don't mind, I-I-I
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind
 
Corporate prison, we stay
I'm a dull boy, work all da y
So I'm strung out anyway
 
Loneliness is not a phase
Field of pain is where I graze
Serenity is far away
 
Saw my reflection and cried
So little hope that I died
Feed me your lies, open wide
Weight of my heart, not the size
 
Pink cloud has now turned to gray
All that I want is to play
Get on your knees time to pray

Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers
In a tomb...in bloom
 
Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
You don't understand who they 
Thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now a man
Who won't let himself be
 
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
Down in a hole, losin' control
I'd like to fly,
But my wings have been so denied
 
Down in a hole and they've put all 
The stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue
Has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty
Of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more
of my feelings beneath
 
Oh I want to be inside of you
 
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
Down in a hole, feelin' so small
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
Down in a hole, out of control
 
I'd like to fly but my 
Wings have been so denied

Know me broken by my master
Teach thee on child of love hereafter
 
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
 
Drifting body it's sole desertion
Flying not yet quite the notion
 
Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home
Have I gone?
And left you here alone
If I would, could you?
