I just seen trouble
He's calling out your name tonite
Billy get your guns
You could walk away
But I know you born to fight
So Billy get your guns
The bandileros are strung out
In the promenade
Billy get your guns
And the wind whispers softly
That the devil's to blame
Billy get your guns

Billy get your guns
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane
Billy get your guns
That's the price on your head
For the price of fame
And it'll never change
Billy get your guns

There's a whiskey bottle empty
Sittin' on the bar
Billy get your guns
And some organ grinder singing
About some sucker moving on
Billy get your guns
All the whores are hanging out
Waiting to get paid
Billy get your guns
From some Johny on the spot
Who said hey keep the change baby

Billy get your guns

They christened you with whiskey
And theres' fire running through your veins
Well you're a outlaw just the same
And every night a bullet wears your name

I've seen a hangman dancing
Beneath the pale moonlight
Billy get your guns
And every stranger that you meet
Thinks it's his lucky night
Billy get your guns
I don't envy you Billy
But I want to say
You better get your guns
'Cause every outlaw that's died
Will live to ride again
Billy get your guns

Billy get your guns...
