You have a winning way, so keep it
Your future
You are an angel heading for a land of sunshine
And fortune is smiling upon you
Prepare for a series of a comfortable miracles
From fasting to feasting
And life to you is a dashing, bold adventure
So sing, and rejoice
And look for the dream that keeps coming back
Your future
Pat yourself on the back and give yourself a handshake
Cuz everything is not yet lost...
(Does life seem worthwhile to you?)
Here's how to order!
Does life seem worthwhile to you?
Do others push you around?
Is age against you?
Sing and rejoice!
Does life seem worthwhile to you?
Does emotional music
Have quite an effect on you?
I-I can help-I can help you-I can help you help yourself!
Here's how to order!
Varicose
Comatose
Senile
Caffeine
Pour shame all over us
Harden into a crust
- - - cement - - -
 Forget the glamour and
Mumble a jackhammer
- - - under your breath - - -
Hide your face in the curtains
Better unsaid, so close
And it rolls off the tongue
ALMOST
The world expects the pose
Perfectly natural
- - - loosen up - - -
Smearing wet concrete
And swearing you'll never be
- - - caught - - -
At your weakest, etched in stone
And we're frozen here, peeking

Almost, sweet talk, Caffeine
Make contact
Up to my neck
I confess in quicksand
"But it's so easy for you"
"There's always one thing"
"Do you have something to tell me?"
"Say something"
"Anything"
"I'm warning you"
"I'm warning you"
"I'm fucking you"
"I'm warning you"
"Relax"
"It's just a phase"
"You'll grow out of it"
Believe anything anyone ever tells you
It's not funny any more
It's thing you hate the most

Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
A little discipline
For my pet genius
My head is like lettuce
Go on dig your thumbs in
I cannot stop giving
I'm thirty-something
Sense of security
Like pockets jingling
Midlife crisis
Suck ingenuity
Down through the family tree
You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleedin' enough for two
It's a midlife crisis...
What an inheritance
The salt and the kleenex
Morbid self attention
Bending my pinky back
A little discipline
A donor by habit
A little discipline
Rent an opinion
Sense of security
Holding blunt instrument
I'm a perfectionist
And perfect is a skinned knee
You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleedin' enough for two
It's a midlife crisis...

Backside melts into a sofa
My world, my TV, and my food
Besides listening to my belly gurgle
Ain't much else to do
Yeah, I sweat a lot
Pants fall down every time I bend over
And my feet itch
Yeah-I married a scarecrow
I hate you
Talking to myself
Everibody's starin' at me
I'm only bleedin'
Someone taps me on the shoulder every 5 minutes
Nobody speaks English anymore
Would anybody tell me I was gettin' stupider?
I hate you
Talking to myself
You don't feel it after awhile
You take the beating
I'm a swingin' guy
Throw a belt over the shower curtain rod
And swing - - -
Toss me inside a Hefty
And put me in the ground
A drink needs me
I don't
I ain't about to guzzle no tears
so kiss my ass
newscasters, coakroaches, and desserts
I hate you
Talkin' to myself
Everibody's starin' at me
I'm only bleedin'

Drought makes the workers dream
Muscles and fields of green
Shovel the last few crumbs
Of generosity
Open heart, open mind, open mouth, open vein

Someday the rains will come
My blistered hands tell me
Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow

smaller and smaller and smaller

Things worked out better than we have planned
Capital from boy, woman and man
We're like ink and paper
Numbers on a calculator
Knew arithmetic so well
Working overtime
Completed what was assigned
We had to multiply ourselves
A bouncing little baby
A shiny copper penny
And he spent himself
Would not listen to us
But when he lost his appetite
He lost his weight and friends
Baby became a fat nickel so fast
Then came puberty
Exponentially
Soon our boy became a million
People loved him so
And helped him to grow
Everyone knew the thing that was best
Of course, he must invest
A penny won't do
But he made us proud
He made us rich
But how were we to know
He's counterfeit
Now everything's ruined

The crowd roars
It's deep and so unhealthy
The rest you know
I'll feel the hands that felt me
Cold hands
Your hands
Cover my mouth
While I'm staring into bright lights
APPLAUSE
The crowd roars
The rest you know
Ten lovers violating
Cured
Discharged
Reach back inside
Knuckle white
Ruffle white
The crowd roars
They ruined and repaired me
The rest you know
The hands removed the bad thing
MIRACLE

Return to my own vomit like a dog
Rhymes and giggles muffle the dialogue
Carve my initials in a tree, I will never leave
Maybe one day I'll be royalty
Kingdom
Kindergarten
Born late
Will I graduate?
Drinking fountains are shorter than they used to
The swings on the playground don't even fit me anymore
Folklore: Nobody's supposed to believe in the next grade
WRITE IT A HUNDRED TIMES
Kingdom
Kindergarten
Waiting
Bell's not ringing
Held back again
Everything got quiet suddenly ; no dolby
And the theatre is empty
Film is flapping on the side of the projector
The reel is over
Banished with my sticky shoes and stinging eyes
I'M WALKING OUTSIDE
Kingdom
Kindergarten
Born late
Will I graduate?
Held back again

What's yours is mine and mine is mine
That's plain to see
So give it up

I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW
Be aggressive

What someone else
Would leave behind
And spit it out, let's go to waste
I claim as mine
You're my flovor of the week
I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW
Tall and reckless
Ugly seed
Reach down my throat
You filthy bird
That's all I need
This empty pit
I've got to feed
To prove I'm fit
A healthy man
I've got to be
Malnutrition, my submission
You're the master
And I take it on my knees
Ejaculation
Tribulation
I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW, I SWALLOW

A hierarchy
Spread out on the nightstand
The spirit of team
Salvation is another chance
A sore loser
Yelling with my mouth shut
A cracking portrait
The fondling of the trophies
The null of losing
Can you afford that luxury?
A sore winner
But I'll just keep my mouth shut
It shouldn't bother me
But it does
The small victories
The cankers and medallions
They keep me thinking that someday
I might beat you
But I'll just keep my mouth shut
The little nothings
It shouldn't bother me
But it does
IF I SPEAK AT ONE CONSTANT VOLUME AT ONE CONSTANT PITCH
AT ONE CONSTANT RHYTHM RIGHT INTO YOUR EAR, YOU STILL WON'T HEAR
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear
You still won't hear

Sink the eight ball
Buy the lady a drink
And nobody knows my name
Bodies float up
From the bottom of the river
Like bubbles in fine champagne
He's the one, no doubt
Walkin' on a tightrope
He's the one, no doubt
Got a gash on my head
And a grin on my face
And a shadow called danger
Hidin' in the sheets
And on the streets
In the heart of every stranger
Here he comes, look out
Teach the world a lesson
Here he comes, look out
Sweat on the brow
And a tap on the phone
And lives are on the line
Pick up the briefcase
On a high speed chase
Breathin' by the roll
of the dice
Reachin' up to the top
We're dependin' on you
Reachin' up to the top
"In regards to
My usage of the drug...
it modified my personality
to the extent that I was
highly irritable"
"I was like a crack Hitler"
Keep up the fight
And in the wink of an eye
Never give up

Bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide the dirty minutes under my dirty mattress and they are making me itch
My time
Is split milk
My skin is a layer of soot
I'm spending my days scrubbing
I'm trying so hard to act like nothing happened (no one left to blame)
I'm trying so hard to find that fresh, clean smell (no one left to blame)
Smiles

Bruises
Bars in the womb
I hide the dirty minutes under my dirty mattress and they are making me itch
