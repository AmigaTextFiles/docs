A child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
There were planes to catch, bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away

He was talking 'fore I knew it and when he could, he said
"I'm gonna be like you, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like you"

My son turned ten just the other day
He said "Thanks for the ball dad, come on, let's play
Could you teach me to throw?", I said "Not today
I got a lot to do", he said "That's OK"

He walked away with a smile on his face, he said
"I'm gonna be like him, yeah
you know I'm gonna be like him"

The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and a man on the moon
When you comin' home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

When he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just have to say
I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while
He shook his head and he said with a smile

What I'm feeling like, dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please

The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and a man on the moon
When you comin' home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

Long since retired, my son moved away
I called him up just the other day
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind
He said: "I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time

You see, my new job's ass and the kids got the flew
but it's sure nice talking to you dad
It was sure nice talking to you"

And as I hung up the phone is occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me!

The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and a man on the moon
When you comin' home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then
