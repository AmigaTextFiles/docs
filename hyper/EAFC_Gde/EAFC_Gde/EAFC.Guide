 @{b}Decision [#1]@{ub} (1997)

 The American Companion, Da'an, was due to arrive in a Midwestern city on an
 official visit where Police Captain William Boone was prevented by the
 Companions from implementing all the security arrangements he requested. The
 alien leader arrived in a Taelon shuttle from Washington, chauffeured by
 Marine pilot Captain Lili Marquette. Da'an had a special announcement to make
 about a new venture with one of the Earth's biggest industrialists, the
 eccentric billionaire Jonathan Doors.

 The Taelon front man, FBI Agent Ronald Sandoval, discounted Boone's
 apprehensions about controlling the huge crowd and securing neighbouring
 buildings so when Da'an arrived, Boone enlists the help of his second in
 command, Lieutenant Bob Morovsky. Despite their precautions, a shot was fired
 from a nearby building and Doors took the bullet meant for Da'an. Agent
 Sandoval used his Skrill (an alien life form bio-engineered by the Taelons for
 use as a weapon), to dissolve the building wall, revealing a lone gunman.
 Boone took off in hot pursuit, only to come face to face with his old war
 buddy, Eddie Jordan. Stunned, Boone was unable to stop Jordan's escape.

 The Taelons declared Boone a major hero, but Boone is more interested in
 finding out why his best friend turned into a murderer. Boone's conflict
 with Sandoval continued, even as the FBI agent extended an offer from Da'an
 to make him their Commander of Security and Interspecies Relations. Boone
 declined - his priorities were to catch Jordan and to start a family with
 his beloved wife Kate.

 Jordan, it turns out, was part of an underground resistance, which becomes
 evident when he secretly met with Lili, who was also part of the group. Boone
 began making connections between the shooting and an organized movement
 against the Taelons, but suddenly his world came apart. A car bomb ends Kate's
 life in a horrible explosion.

 Devastated by his wife's death, Boone threw himself into the investigation.
 Thinking it might help the case, Boone entertained Da'an's job offer. But
 before accepted, Lili takes him to the Flat Planet Cafe, where he met his
 fugitive friend Jordan and was presented with a second surprise. Jonathan
 Doors faked his own death, thus clearing the way to become leader of the
 Resistance.

 Convincing Boone that Kate's murder was arranged by the Taelons, the
 Resistance devised a way for Boone to infiltrate the Companions. Dr. Julianne
 Belman, secretly a Resistance sympathizer, successfully implanted Boone with a
 re-engineered Cyber-Viral Implant (CVI). A CVI is part germ, part computer and
 is implanted by the Companions into the brains of their most trusted
 operatives. It greatly increases mental capabilities, but also alters the
 recipients' motivations so that their sole focus is the well-being of the
 Companions. Boone's re-engineered CVI gave him the enhanced mental powers
 without altering his motivations.

 Before Boone starts his new job, Eddie Jordan turns up dead. Did Sandoval
 kill him or was it Doors, or even the beautiful Lili Marquette? Boone
 doesn't know who to trust. Was one of them involved in the death of his
 best friend and his wife?

 So Boone began his search for the truth.

 @{b}Truth [#2]@{ub} (1997)

 In the wake of the attempt on his life, the American Companion Da'an met with
 the Taelon Council to commend William Boone for saving him from assassination
 and appoint Boone Commander of Security and Interspecies Relations. Announcing
 the news at a press conference, Boone and Da'an promise to undo Earth's
 growing resistance to the Taelon presence.

 The eccentric techno-genius Augur, an acquaintance of Boone's from his cop
 days, watched the televised proceedings at the Flat Planet Cafe . Installed in
 his new office with the help of FBI Agent Ronald Sandoval, Boone was cautious
 to conceal the fact that his Cyber-Viral Implant (CVI) has been modified by
 the Resistance, making him unlike the true Implant that Sandoval has become.
 With his new mental powers, Boone is able to relive every detail of his life
 with Kate, which increased his determination to solve her murder, even if it
 jeopardized his new position in the Taelon inner circle.

 By searching through his memories of his wife's last day, Boone was able to
 recall a suspicious car trailing Kate. Despite warnings from Captain Lili
 Marquette to abandon his search, Boone went to Augur's computer junkyard lair,
 where he entreated the notorious hacker to help him find the killer. Augur
 broke through security files to uncover the name of Judson Corr, a known
 professional assassin. Boone confronted Corr at his condominium, but the
 hitman's sophisticated defences allowed him to escape.

 As Da'an became suspicious of Boone's obsessive behaviour, Boone had to
 convince the Companion that catching Kate's murderer will serve the greater
 cause of protecting the Taelons. Resistance leader Jonathan Doors, also
 worried about Boone's vendetta, wondered if he'll have to kill him. To make
 matters worse, Agent Sandoval was tracking Boone, ready to destroy him if he
 compromised Taelon security.

 At Augur's hideout, when Corr showed up to eliminate the computer trace that
 revealed his identity, he found himself face to face with Boone. Sandoval and
 Marquette arrived in the middle of a wild shoot-out, which ended when Sandoval
 blasted Corr with his Skrill. Putting two and two together, Boone accused
 Sandoval of Kate's murder, which the agent freely admits to. He said he did it
 to ensure Boone's allegiance to the Taelons, just as he had to commit his own
 wife to an asylum to get her out of the way. More than ever before, Boone felt
 contempt for both sides in the world he must live in - the Taelons, as well as
 the equally brutal Resistance.

 @{b}Old Flame [#3]@{ub} (1997)

 At a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Companion Music Conservatory, Boone
 was stunned when the featured "Tubes" performer was Elyse Chapel, the first
 great love of his life. As soon as he set eyes on her, his Cyber-Viral Implant
 (CVI) caused him to have tempestuous memories of their passionate love affair
 from his younger days. When the two met after the concert, it was obvious to
 Lili, Da'an and Sandoval that Boone was under the woman's spell. Boone and
 Elyse slipped away to the Flat Planet Cafe, where they reminisced about their
 past together. It was clear that Boone had never forgotten Elyse despite his
 great love for his late wife, Kate.

 Meanwhile, in the same early hours, a sophisticated heist was under way at a
 nearby nuclear power plant. An armoured truck was ambushed, its precious cargo
 of plutonium hijacked by professional terrorists. Boone and Lili were on the
 case the next morning, but Lili was equally concerned about Boone's
 involvement with Elyse. Boone put his career in jeopardy when he slipped away
 to meet with her a second time instead of tracking the terrorists. When Elyse
 stumbled into a subway shoot-out with the gunmen, it became apparent to
 everyone that Boone's judgment was being severely compromised.

 Determined to save her friend, Lili turned to Augur, whose feelings for her
 were becoming more than just professional. Together they find out that Elyse
 Chapel was an FBI agent sent to test Boone's allegiance to the Taelons, and
 their supposed affair was just a fabricated memory in his CVI. When Elyse
 played her card and told Boone she was a resistance member, he knew his proper
 response should have been to arrest her immediately but instead he stalled,
 wanting to know who was trying to destroy him. A successful take-down of the
 nuclear terrorists revealed the entire operation was one of Sandoval's
 schemes, orchestrated with Da'an's complete compliance. Delivering Elyse to
 Taelon headquarters where the ruse was fully revealed, Boone once again ends
 up the broken-hearted loner, working for both sides, but belonging to no one.

 @{b}Avatar [#4]@{ub} (1997)

 James Pike was one of the most notorious inmates of his maximum security
 prison - a lawyer turned serial killer. In the dead of night, he completed a
 strange mural on his cell wall, painted with his own blood. The next day the
 guard found him dead, but as the prison physician, Dr. Kaplan, began an
 autopsy, Pike awakened and escaped.

 William Boone and Capt. Lili Marquette were summoned to the prison following
 Pike's break-out. In Pike's cell, they found the whole wall filled with
 unknown rune-like characters and bestial images. Central among them were
 strange Siamese twins - one all eye, one all mouth. And at the bottom of the
 wall was a huge faceless sleeping giant.

 Puzzled by why he had been relegated to such "mundane" police work, Boone soon
 finds out that Da'an could be the killer's intended target, since James Pike
 is a CVI experiment gone terribly wrong. Da'an explained that the Taelons
 wanted to try to rehabilitate the most pathological of criminals to test the
 power of their CVIs, and that Pike had been implanted two years prior to his
 escape, programmed with a motivational imperative to love humankind.

 Somehow, Pike had used his CVI to enter the private world of the Taelons, to
 understand their language, to break their secret codes and use the knowledge
 they kept hidden from Earth. The drawings in his cell were a retelling of an
 ancient Taelon myth, a story of evil and revenge that Pike felt he must
 enact. As he prepared to fulfil his destiny, Pike started a new trail of
 death in his first motel refuge, forcing one biker to stab another to death,
 and decorating their bodies with more of the strange Taelon hieroglyphs.
 Boone spoke to Dr. Belman about the workings of Pike's CVI and got some
 distressing news: Pike's implant was burning out and she couldn't be sure
 that all the CVIs weren't programmed with a "doomsday date", causing them to
 self-destruct and kill their recipients.

 When Boone and Pike faced off at a satellite transmission station, Boone's
 Skrill is rendered useless. Pike attacked Boone but did not kill him. Instead,
 he teased him with a strange message from the Taelon myth.

 Next, Pike sent a hologram transmission to taunt Boone, which Lili traced to
 his lair. She finds Dr. Belman bound and gagged, her head shaven, with more of
 the strange Taelon drawings on her head. Boone headed to Belman's lab, where
 he found a badly-wounded Agent Sandoval whose Skrill has been stolen by Pike.

 Boone then followed Da'an to his appearance at an ecumenical conference, where
 Pike attempted to vaporize the Taelon with his stolen Skrill. But Boone had
 engineered it so that Pike attacked a hologram, rather that Da'an himself. By
 that time, Pike deduced that Boone had also broken through his CVI. As he lay
 dying, he told Boone that the Taelons' world was inside the minds they gave
 their Implants, and urged him to look deep inside himself for the truth about
 why the Companions are on Earth.

 @{b}Miracle [#5]@{ub} (1997)

 William Boone encountered a suicidal young woman with artificial limbs for
 hands, poised to leap off the top of a building. Boone's CVI identified her
 as Julie Payton, the orphaned daughter of famous missionary parents who were
 killed in a fiery car crash which also destroyed Julie's hands. After Boone
 talked Julie down from the building, he discussed her case with Da'an, who
 chose her as the first "public" recipient of experimental Taelon limb
 regeneration technology.

 As Boone bonded with Julie, he became suspicious of the Taelon medical
 program and ponders why Da'an used the word "public" when referring to the
 decision to operate on Julie. He wondered if there were previous limb
 regenerations and if so, what happened to the patients. The operation on
 Julie proceeded and her limbs were successfully transformed. Recovering full
 use of her beautiful new hands, Julie viewed the experience as nothing less
 than a miracle, which inspired her to believe that the Companions are
 messengers of God. This touched off a groundswell of religious fervour, which
 was quickly capitalized on by Travis Murray, founder of the new Church of the
 Companions. He was thrilled when Julie showed up at his Church during a live
 on-line meeting. Boone, on the other hand, was not so happy. He questioned
 Julie's religious view of the Companions and doubted that Travis Murray's
 motives were in the girl's best interest.

 Boone and Lili Marquette developed a real fondness for Julie and were
 determined to protect her, ready to act on a pronouncement from Jonathan Doors
 that she was in grave danger if anything goes wrong with the regeneration
 process. Prophetically, Julie's new hands began to deteriorate and she turned
 to Murray for help. As the Taelons discuss "isolation procedures" with FBI
 Agent Ronald Sandoval, Boone and Lili found Julie under the protective custody
 of Murray. Breaking into Reverend Murray's headquarters, they were able to
 spirit her out of the building. In a plan devised to ensure her long-term
 safety, Boone and Lili arranged for Julie to appear on a top-rated TV talk
 show where she announced to the world that although her operation was
 unsuccessful in material terms, she considered it a true miracle since it
 created faith and strength in her. Despite Julie's announcement, the
 membership of the Church of the Companions increased and in a frightening
 moment of complicity, Da'an complemented Murray on strengthening the
 Companions' message through his work with Julie.

 @{b}Scorpions Dream [#6]@{ub} (1997)

 Dr. Larry Clark, a brilliant and devoted young scientist in the Companions'
 development lab, was heading up a research project on the Alpha series of
 Skrills - alien life forms bio-engineered by the Taelons for use as weapons by
 Implants. Clark had come to love the Skrills, giving them nicknames, and
 fretting over his "maternity" ward. When Commander William Boone arrived at
 Clark's lab to tell him they're closing down his project, Clark was crushed.
 Boone, who wore an updated form of Skrill, knows exactly what kind of
 potential destructive threat Clark's primitive version presents. Alone in his
 lab, Clark dejectedly stroked the "mother" in his Alpha series, which suddenly
 fused to his arm. Clark slipped out of the building, but did he save the
 Skrill or did the Skrill use Clark to save itself?

 Clark's boss, Dr. Basi, alerted Boone to the emergency. Boone called in
 Captain Lili Marquette to help search for Clark. Meanwhile, Dr. Clark was
 hanging out in a train station diner where he was attracted to a streetwise
 girl named Janice Green. Later, out on the train platform, Clark became aware
 of his Skrill's awesome power when he used it to save Janice from a gang of
 thugs. Larry took Janice to hide away on a sailboat at a nearby marina. She
 eagerly accompanied him, secretly plotting to steal the Skrill in order to
 sell it on the black market.

 Boone and Marquette tracked the fugitives to the marina, where Clark fired on
 Lili and escaped. Boone realized he's dealing with a walking time bomb. Clark
 started to slip in and out of a manic state, his physical appearance
 deteriorating rapidly. Janice ran away from him, only to be cornered by FBI
 Agent Ronald Sandoval, who wanted to kill Clark before he threatened the
 Taelons. Clark returned to his lab, and discovered that Dr. Basi had
 terminated his Skrill "offspring," which threw him into a murderous rage.
 Boone confronted him and tried to convince him that the Skrill was now
 controlling his every move. Clark escaped to the tunnels beneath the lab,
 where Sandoval planned to gas him.

 Risking his own life, Boone followed Clark into the underground labyrinth,
 trying to get his Skrill to communicate with Clark's. Ultimately, he found
 Clark and was able to release the scientist from his private hell.

 @{b}Float Like A Butterfly [#7]@{ub} (1997)

 William Boone and Lili Marquette got a call from Elijah Good, a doctor in the
 small Amish town of Paradise. A couple of citizens of Paradise had committed
 suicide, apparently suffering from "Companion Syndrome" - a malady related to
 the profound displacement caused by the arrival of the Companions. Although
 the world had been relatively free of this ailment, the Amish are sheltered
 from outside influences which could have explained the delay in their
 experiencing it. Boone and Lili headed to Paradise, much to the chagrin of the
 town's elders who resented outside interference from the "English." Shortly
 after arriving, Boone and Lili were present at the discovery of another
 suicide - a man who stood in a freezer until he froze to death. As they
 examined the body, his mouth opened and a butterfly flew out.

 Boone asked Da'an if any Taelon experiments were being conducted in the area
 and got a negative reply. Elijah, Boone and Lili wanted to get to the heart of
 the mystery by performing autopsies on the bodies of the deceased but their
 request was denied by the elders, who also imposed the "Meidung" on Elijah -
 which effectively shut him off from his family and the town.

 Things took an even darker turn for Elijah when his wife Sarah was the next
 victim of the mysterious butterflies. Fortunately, he got to her before she
 died, but it's touch and go. While talking to Elijah's son Jedediah, Boone
 learned of his discovery of a "metal scarecrow" - a mother probe. Early on,
 the probe absorbed a butterfly and now the town was in the grip of a plague of
 tiny probes shaped like butterflies.

 Boone had to rush to contain the probe without letting Da'an know of its
 existence: if it was Taelon in origin, it would be a valuable piece of
 Companion hardware for the Resistance. Of course, it could have other origins.

 Containing it proved to be easier said than done and the butterflies
 swarmed to attack the shuttle, Boone and Lili. Boone lead the butterflies
 back to the probe and Skrills them as they hover over it. The melted goop
 from the Skrilled butterflies covered the probe and shut it down. Paradise
 returned to peaceful tranquillity and the Resistance got the probe which,
 for now, is inactive.

 @{b}Resurrection [#8]@{ub} (1997)

 As millions around the world watched, coverage of the World Bowl was
 interrupted by Jonathan Doors and the startling announcement that not only
 was he still alive, he had organized a Liberation movement.

 William Boone and Lili Marquette were among those left speechless by the
 surprise telecast. As Sandoval organized an investigation, Boone and Lili
 tried to locate and protect Doors. The Taelons went into overdrive and the
 ramifications for Da'an, who was duped by this human, were severe. He was
 stripped of his command and replaced by Zo'or, a more militant Taelon with a
 very low tolerance for humans.

 Doors' second media attack on the Taelons focused on suspicious allegations
 of "experiments" being conducted. He specifically targeted Futurity Farm, a
 joint venture between the Taelons and Jonathan Doors' old company, Doors
 International.

 While Zo'or and Sandoval arranged a cover-up, Boone worked to restore Da'an
 to his post as the American Companion. Boone devised a plan that
 simultaneously exposed the experiments as fact and caused Zo'or to lose face
 with the Taelons. Zo'or was out and Da'an resumed his position. Augur, whom
 they discover has been with the Liberation movement all along, directs Boone
 and Lili to Jonathan Doors - and the new state-of-the-art underground
 Resistance Headquarters.

 @{b}Horizon Zero [#9]@{ub} (1997)

 A long-planned international mission to Mars was unexpectedly cancelled
 because it is "unnecessary." Da'an offered Captain Paul Chandler and his
 two-person crew a chance to join the Taelon inter-dimensional flight training
 program instead. They flatly refused and Chandler stormed out, but showed up
 later at the fitness course where Boone and Lili were working out.

 Chandler and Lili were old friends, having met years before during F-22 flight
 training at Valdosta. They caught up over lunch and, mentioning Da'an's offer,
 Chandler convinced Lili to take him for a ride in the shuttle.

 The next day, the shuttle disappeared and Lili, stung by Chandler's
 betrayal, was called on the carpet for her actions. Da'an was unusually
 vehement that Chandler and the shuttle be found immediately, but was vague
 about the reasons why.

 Boone and Lili were able to track Chandler to a farm where he and his crew
 were attempting to take the Taelon shuttle to Mars - with little success.
 Boone brings in Augur and together they were able to overcome the
 Taelon-programmed navigational block. Narrowly escaping capture by Sandoval,
 Chandler and his crew blasted out of the Earth's atmosphere and headed for
 Mars. They were able to bring back evidence which explained why the Taelons
 were so concerned about human space exploration.

 @{b}Live Free Or Die [#10]@{ub} (1997)

 Earth's foremost astronomers had gathered at a planetarium for a special
 appearance by Da'an, who would be making a presentation about the planet
 Taelon. Da'an's speech was barely under way when a spectator, who had
 disguised himself as disabled, released nerve gas from a canister hidden in
 his wheelchair.

 The entire audience was quickly overcome by the fumes, including William
 Boone, Captain Lili Marquette and Agent Ron Sandoval. By the time the
 Companion security unit regained consciousness, Da'an had been kidnapped,
 and Sandoval immediately blamed Jonathan Doors. In reality, Da'an was
 captured by renegade soldiers, members of a special forces squad used in a
 Taelon bioengineering experiment.

 Major Ray McIntyre, who released the nerve gas and leads the renegades, and
 Captain Lucas Johnson, were two of the volunteers in an inter-dimensional
 flight training program. But before they were sent out into space, the
 soldiers were subjected to secret experiments, changing their biology to a
 more Taelon-like form to withstand the bending of time and space. McIntyre and
 Johnson escaped while five members of their squad remain in captivity, hidden
 away in a military/Taelon cover-up. The men planned to force a trade for the
 rest of their group, holding Da'an until they could expose the conspiracy.

 The Taelon Synod, however, refused to bargain for Da'an's life. Doors was
 concerned that Da'an's death would destroy public sympathy for the resistance
 and turn Da'an into a martyr. Doors orders Boone and Lili to find Da'an at
 all costs, and to kill the soldiers if necessary even though they could be
 useful converts to the resistance cause.

 Meanwhile, Sandoval's implant imperative was driving him to extreme
 behaviour in his search for Da'an. Boone and Lili worry that kidnappers and
 captive could all end up dead. While America prayed for Da'an's release,
 Augur helped Boone search for the soldiers' hideout, trying to stay one step
 ahead of Sandoval. Tracking the kidnappers to an abandoned warehouse, Boone
 found Da'an in a terribly weakened state and it was clear that the Taelon
 was willing his own death.

 As he tried to help Da'an out of the building, Boone was captured by McIntyre
 and Johnson. Doors arrived on the scene to offer himself in exchange for
 Da'an, promising the soldiers he would find their missing men. But suddenly
 Sandoval arrived, accompanied by a SWAT team. Doors and McIntyre fled to the
 roof to escape by helicopter, but Johnson was gunned down.

 Back inside the building, Boone and Sandoval begged Da'an to return to life
 since his essence had left his body and was floating free. Boone convinced
 Da'an he was needed on Earth and the Taelon re-animated himself.

 After recovering from his experience, Da'an was finally able to present his
 astronomy lecture, but the Companion had added one more duty to his schedule.
 With un-Taelon-like sympathy, Da'an sat by a hospital bed, offering solace to
 Johnson who was comatose.

 @{b}Sandoval's Run [#11]@{ub} (1997)

 During his interrogation of anti-Taelon activist Nell Hagar, Agent Ron
 Sandoval collapsed in intense pain with blood running from his ear. William
 Boone transported him to Dr. Belman who confirmed that Sandoval's CVI was
 breaking down, endangering his life. Da'an gave permission for the
 degenerating CVI to be removed because he knew it must be replaced for
 Sandoval to survive. Boone worried he was facing the same fate, but was
 soon caught up in a violent confrontation with Sandoval, who threatened
 Da'an and took Captain Lili Marquette hostage as he escaped on the shuttle.
 Sandoval's mind may have been freed from Taelon control, but he faced
 certain death without a new CVI.

 Boone raced to save his fellow security agent because the Taelon Synod
 ordered Sandoval's "termination." The Synod knew that unlike Boone's,
 Sandoval's implant had given him the full picture of the Taelon presence on
 Earth and their plans for the future.

 Sandoval ordered Lili to take him to the hospital where he had
 institutionalized his wife Dee Dee in one of his first heartless duties as a
 Taelon Implant. He tied Lili up in the shuttle and found Dee Dee, determined
 to get her to a safe place. Boone tracked Sandoval to the hospital and arrived
 with a SWAT team, releasing Lili from the shuttle. They confronted Sandoval as
 he wheeled his drugged wife out of the building and a shoot-out ensued. But
 Boone let Sandoval escape, even though he may only have had hours to live.

 Sandoval reconciled with Dee Dee and helped her recover from the drugs in a
 hotel room. He then used his global to access information that would help him
 find Jonathan Doors and hopefully, asylum with the resistance. Boone followed
 Sandoval to Nell Hagar's loft, where he told Sandoval he was part of the
 resistance and offered to help. He took Sandoval and Dee Dee to a safe house,
 where Sandoval again collapsed. Dr. Belman confirmed that in order to save
 him, she had to turn Sandoval back into a full Implant with another
 fully-functional CVI, which would obliterate any trace of the person he was.

 Dee Dee was dead, and Sandoval believed Boone had murdered her, just as he
 murdered Boone's wife under Taelon orders. Believing himself to be alone in
 the world, Sandoval underwent the operation, returning to serve Da'an and
 the Taelons.

 In reality, Dee Dee was given a new identity by the resistance. And Sandoval
 was changed, even as an Implant. He thanked Boone for saving his life, and
 although he no longer had full access to the truth behind the Taelon presence
 on Earth, he did reveal that the fate of humanity and the Taelons are
 inextricably linked. That they need humanity as much as humanity needs them.

 Sandoval assumed Boone had only pretended to be part of the resistance to get
 him back under control and still believed Boone was a full Implant like
 himself. But when Boone saw Sandoval wearing Dee Dee's wedding band - a
 decidedly sentimental gesture for an Implant - Boone wondered whether Sandoval
 might be leading his own double life.

 @{b}The Scarecrow Returns [#12]@{ub} (1997)

 Deep below the ground at resistance headquarters, William Boone met with two
 molecular biologists who were studying the alien probe captured after it
 wreaked havoc on an Amish community.

 Sahjit Jinnah and his fiancee Rayna Armitraj used fibre optics to drill inside
 the probe, trying to identify its purpose. But when Boone and Sahjit left the
 lab, a sudden power surge caused Rayna to cut open the top of the probe. The
 probe responded by emitting a powerful beam which enveloped Rayna and
 dematerialised her piece by piece, ingesting each portion.

 Unaware of the situation, Sahjit and Boone met with Doors and Auger to discuss
 the probe's purpose. They recalled its ability to replicate butterflies into
 miniature killer probes which previously killed several people. Back in the
 lab, the probe replicated Rayna, "birthing" two clones to take her place.

 Boone met with Da'an to ask the Companion's permission to study the Taelon
 language, which he believed would help the resistance decode the probe's
 operating commands. Da'an gave his consent, and even helped Boone learn the
 Taelon "alphabet."

 Back at resistance headquarters, Auger and Captain Lili Marquette had
 deciphered the probe's transmission coordinates to determine where exactly it
 was sending information. Oddly, the probe seemed to be trying to send
 information to a point on the other end of the galaxy from the planet Taelon.
 As they discussed their findings with Doors, Boone and Sahjit tried to
 communicate with the probe, when suddenly one of Rayna's clones appeared and
 immolated itself on the headquarters reactor power generator. Sahjit was
 beside himself with grief thinking it was Rayna when the second clone appeared
 and attacked Lili in the lab. As the clone moved to kill Lili, the probe sent
 a burst of energy into the sky, relaying a transmission. The clone turned its
 attention to the probe and Lili was momentarily spared, although she was still
 trapped inside the lab.

 Da'an and Agent on Sandoval detected the transmission and put a trace on the
 it to find the probe. The trace lead them into the tunnels which are the outer
 defence of the resistance hideout. Boone and Sahjit worked furiously to cut a
 laser into the clone's force field surrounding the lab, finally getting in to
 blow the Rayna clone to bits. With Lili safe, they had to turn over the probe
 to the Taelons, who could control it, without Sandoval and Da'an finding the
 headquarters. To make matters worse, the probe morphed into a pile of crystal
 sand, and disappeared into the lab's ventilation ducts.

 With Sandoval and Da'an moments from their doorstep, and Doors threatening to
 blow up the whole facility, Boone devised a plan to save them all. He used
 reactor fuel to coax the probe back to its original form and lead it into the
 tunnels. As the probe began to analyse the fuel, Da'an and Sandoval arrived.
 The probe turned to attack them but Da'an had obviously encountered these
 probes before and, with a struggle, was able to "cap" the probe with a Taelon
 device, finally shutting it down.

 @{b}The Secret Of Strandhill [#13]@{ub} (1997)

 The monolithic Strand Hill ruins in Ireland was one of Earth's most revered
 historical sites. Local tour guide and roustabout Tim O'Malley lead a group
 around the stone circle, then down into a passage grave. As he told the
 tourists the local legend of a mystical king, the ground suddenly rocked by
 a blast from nearby construction. As the groups fled, O'Malley saw a
 startling mosaic uncovered by a crumbling wall. He pocketed a fragment that
 has broken loose.

 Word spread to the Taelons about the mosaic, which they believed was a
 marker for the grave of Ma'el, a Taelon scout sent to Earth thousands of
 years ago. The Taelon Synod ordered Da'an to step up the search for Ma'el's
 datalog of research, which they had so far been unable to find. The
 datalog's contents would determine whether the Taelons would continue to
 remain on Earth or move on to another planet. Da'an was forced to accept the
 help of his nemesis Zo'or, who the Synod appointed as Companion
 Representative to the United Nations.

 As O'Malley schemed about selling the mosaic artifact, Siobhan Beckett, the
 security Implant of the United Kingdom's Companion, burst into the White Horse
 Tavern to arrest him. His bar mates refused to reveal O'Malley's hiding place,
 but Beckett promised to return. Captain Lili Marquette, William Boone and
 Agent Sandoval arrived at Strand Hill and began the search for Ma'el's tomb.
 They examined the mosaic, which showed images of Christ, Buddha and other
 religious leaders of the past, plus ancient Taelon writing. Boone asked Da'an
 to interpret the writing while plotting to find Ma'el's datalog for the
 resistance, knowing it would provide invaluable insight to the Taelon's agenda
 on Earth. But they find that O'Malley's missing piece holds the key to the
 Taelon riddle. Sandoval and Beckett began excavations with a sophisticated
 seismic survey, determined to find Ma'el's final resting place.

 Boone continued the search for O'Malley and staged a drinking contest in the
 White Horse Tavern. If Boone won, the bar patrons would lead him to O'Malley
 and since his CVI prevents him from becoming intoxicated, O'Malley's hiding
 place under the bar was revealed.

 Boone retrieved the missing piece of the mosaic, enabling him to decipher the
 last of Ma'el's riddle. Meanwhile, Sandoval and Beckett were sidetracked by an
 ancient Celtic grave, thinking that it was Ma'el's. But Boone and Lili found
 the real Taelon tomb under the White Horse Tavern. When they opened the
 casket, they found the datalog and a hologram of Ma'el appeared. The Ma'el
 hologram spoke in Taelon, and Boone translated for Lili as the alien scout
 urged the Synod to leave Earth alone. Ma'el stated that humans are not the
 cruel and aggressive beings the Taelons had believed and that given time, they
 would be the aliens' equals. As Lili and Boone tried to comprehend Ma'el's
 message, Sandoval and Beckett arrived and took the datalog to Da'an and Zo'or.

 Da'an and Zo'or met with Quo'on and the Taelon Synod, where it is revealed
 that Ma'el has destroyed his centuries of research. After consultation, and
 despite Da'an's dissent, the Synod decided to proceed with their hidden agenda
 and their occupation of Earth.

 @{b}Pandora's Box [#14]@{ub} (1997)

 As William Boone relaxed in his office, reading and listening to music, he
 heard a man's voice calling his name. He looked around for its source and saw
 a figure clad in a hospital gown across the lobby. It was Captain Lucas
 Johnson, a soldier who had been the victim of a failed bio-engineering
 experiment by the Taelons. Although the Taelons had tried to hide this
 failure, Johnson had escaped with other soldiers who kidnapped Da'an and
 plotted to expose the Taelon experiments. Johnson had been gunned down during
 Da'an's rescue and Boone had believed him dead.

 Boone asked Dr. Belman to examine him to see if his CVI was responsible for
 the strange encounter with Johnson. She assured him it was not.

 Captain Lili Marquette decided to help Boone and went to see Johnson's widow
 Maddy. Maddy told Lili that although the Taelons sent her Johnson's ashes in
 an urn, she was positive they were someone else's remains. She was sure
 Johnson was still alive and that he communicated telepathically with their
 son Cal. Lili took the ashes to have them analysed, and found indeed, they
 did not belong to Johnson.

 Meanwhile, Boone was called to Da'an's office, where he found out about a new
 Taelon experiment. The Taelon scientist Ne'eg was supervising the "devolution"
 of the scientist Rho'ha. In an attempt to understand their human hosts, Ne'eg
 injected Rho'ha with human genetic material and then studied his
 transformation. Jonathan Doors, immediately suspicious of this experiment to
 create a human/Taelon hybrid, suspected the Taelons of trying to engineer a
 cross-species of warriors. Doors contacted Major McIntyre, who had been
 Johnson's commander and partner in kidnapping Da'an, to help investigate this
 latest Taelon manoeuvre.

 In truth, Johnson lay in a coma and the Taelons were using his genetic
 material to perform their biological experiment with Rho'ha. Johnson made
 contact with Boone telepathically, pleading for his help. When Boone visited
 Rho'ha, he saw Johnson's features ripple across the alien's face. Rho'ha also
 bore "the Shaqarava," ancient energy in the form of eye-shaped whorls on the
 palms, which the evolved Taelons no longer exhibit.

 Da'an had become concerned that the experiment may have pulled Ro-hah away
 from the Taelon group- consciousness, the Commonality and awakened a primal
 evil. His fears are soon confirmed. Rho'ha took Boone and Agent Ron Sandoval
 into the woods for some war games, where he used his new energy with
 dangerous force. Boone suspects that Rho'ha had filled the emptiness of the
 absence of the Commonality by making a telepathic connection to Johnson,
 whose DNA he carried.

 As Boone predicted, Rho'ha sneaks into Johnson's hospital room wanting to see
 the human warrior with whom he had telepathically linked, and who he sought to
 understand. McIntyre was there waiting for him, and Rho'ha used the Shaqarava
 to kill him. Rho'ha then left the hospital and made his way to Johnson's
 house, where he held Maddy and Cal Johnson hostage. Back at the hospital,
 Johnson suffered a seizure and was near death.

 Boone and Lili arrived at the house and attempted to capture Rho'ha. The alien
 attacked Lili and escaped into the woods, dragging Maddy and Cal with him.
 Boone pursued them, helped by the ghostly figure of Johnson. Boone fired his
 Skrill at Rho'ha, allowing Maddy and Cal to escape back to the house. But
 Rho'ha overpowered Boone and was about to kill him with the Shaqarava. Back at
 the hospital, Johnson conveys his longing to die, and Da'an makes that
 possible. Johnson's death breaks Rho'ha's telepathic link and the alien is
 confused long enough for Boone to take him down with his Skrill. Still violent
 and raging, Rho'ha is taken into permanent Taelon custody.

 @{b}If You Could Read My Mind [#15]@{ub} (1997)

 Da'an and Zo'or were scheduled to speak at a Conference of Psychic Sciences in
 Boston. Just before their appearance, the Taelon Synod was shocked to discover
 "The Commonality," their own psychic link, had been invaded, risking exposure
 of their secret plans for Earth. Quo'on and the other alien leaders order
 Da'an to find the intruder.

 William Boone and Captain Lili Marquette were assigned to security detail at
 the conference. FBI agent Ron Sandoval accompanied the Companions to their
 speaking engagement, but he had secret orders from Zo'or to execute the
 renegade who had penetrated the Taelon's psychic bond. Katya Petrenko, a
 Russian clairvoyant featured at the conference, showed herself to have not
 only unusual psychic gifts, but an unusual interest in Boone as well.
 Sandoval, impressed by Katya's extraordinary powers, set out to prove her to
 be the psychic intruder.

 At the conference, Katya was introduced to Da'an and Zo'or. She confronted
 Zo'or, telling him the Taelons must change their approach to humans, or they
 will destroy both races. Zo'or was flustered as academics attending the
 conference want her to expand on her statement. But Katya again turned her
 focus to Boone, who agreed to take her to his office for a private
 conversation. There Katya told Boone she had come to the conference to expose
 the Taelons, and that she knew about Jonathan Doors and the resistance. Boone
 tried to stall, not wanting to reveal himself as a double agent.

 Sandoval and Zo'or had decided that Katya was the person they were looking
 for and ordered Judson Corr, a professional assassin, to kill Katya. Corr
 crept into Katya's hotel room and took her hairbrush, planning to use the
 hair collected from it to set a target for a DNA-triggered weapon. The next
 day, Augur took Lili to meet one of his friends, a neighbourhood psychic
 named Madam Marie, to find out if Katya was a phony or a Taelon plant.
 Although skeptical about Katya, Marie and the entire conference, Lili
 changed her mind when Marie revealed personal information about Lili's
 estrangement from her father.

 When Madam Marie was introduced to Katya at the conference, she was
 overwhelmed by the Russian's incredible psychic powers. Katya, however, either
 did not sense or chose to ignore the threat that Corr presented, even as the
 assassin lurked in disguise at the conference. Lili introduced Boone to Madam
 Marie who told him that he and Katya were somehow linked.

 Katya proves her extrasensory perception by leading Boone straight to the
 resistance hideout. Doors was furious, until he proposed that Dr. Belman
 transfer Katya's knowledge of the Taelons into Boone's brain. Despite Dr.
 Belman's warning that the exchange could prove fatal, Katya insisted that
 her time on Earth was at an end, and her mission was to leave her knowledge
 of the Taelons behind.

 When the conference resumes, Katya's premonition proved correct. Corr deployed
 his DNA device at the podium and Katya was overcome with poisonous fumes.

 Boone and Lili rushed Katya to Dr. Belman's lab, where they transferred her
 psychic memory and understanding to Boone. In these memories, Boone learns
 that the Taelon scout named Ma'el, who spent centuries on Earth during ancient
 times, wanted to prevent the Taelons from colonizing Earth, so he gave some
 humans psychic abilities.

 The resistance members were astounded to learn that the Taelons were involved
 in altering the course of human development. But none of this special
 knowledge was enough to save Katya, who died when the transfer was complete.

 Later, Boone met with Da'an and revealed all that he had learned from Katya.
 Da'an suggested that he had his own benign feelings for Earth when he agreed
 to keep Ma'el's "gift" to humans a secret from the rest of the Synod.

 @{b}Wrath Of Achilles [#16]@{ub} (1997)

 Below ground in their secret headquarters, William Boone argued with Jonathan
 Doors about a new resistance offensive. Augur had invented a computer virus
 capable of infiltrating Taelon security and shutting down all of their
 systems at the Washington embassy. Captain Lili Marquette loaded the virus
 using her shuttle controls to avoid a trace. Boone was against the operation
 and warned that the resistance had no way of knowing how the Taelons would
 react when under open assault.

 The virus started to affect Taelon communications and security immediately.
 Agent Ron Sandoval called in Boone and Lili. Though on opposite sides
 regarding the virus offensive, they still had to work together in their
 roles as Taelon security officers. Lili took Da'an in the shuttle to an
 appointment in San Francisco while Boone stayed behind with Sandoval to try
 to stop the virus as it shut down one Taelon system after another. What the
 resistance failed to anticipate was that the virus would also affect
 everything hooked into the Taelon computer and communication system
 worldwide - including Lili's shuttle. Da'an and Lili were suddenly in real
 danger as their shuttle lurched out of control.

 Boone ordered Augur to activate the counter-virus, but they realized it was
 no longer feasible since the Taelon datastream was completely corrupted. As
 Lili prepared to crash-land the shuttle, Boone and Sandoval were also under
 attack as the Taelon building started to deteriorate around them. Lili
 crashed the shuttle into the mountains. Da'an escaped without injury, but
 Lili was badly hurt. Da'an saved her life by getting her out of the craft
 just before it exploded. When she regained consciousness, Lili is very
 conflicted about the fact that she owes her life to Da'an. Meanwhile, Augur
 raced to rework the counter-virus while the virus continued to wreak havoc
 all over the world. As Da'an tended to Lili's injuries, Boone and Sandoval
 tried to find the shuttle crash site. Lili urged Da'an to leave her behind
 but the Taelon refused. Meanwhile, Doors sent out a resistance retrieval team
 with orders to kill Da'an if it meant saving Lili's life. Realizing the
 threat to Da'an, Lili showed her gratitude to him by throwing away her
 locator device and hiding from the search team.

 Back at Taelon headquarters, Boone and Sandoval were under assault by the
 deteriorating building as the organic structure tried to eliminate all foreign
 elements. Boone refused to leave, determined to use the failing systems until
 he can find Lili and Da'an. Augur thought he could stop the virus, but he had
 to send Boone deep into the building to access the central processor. Boone
 and Sandoval made their way through the dangerous corridors. Meanwhile, the
 resistance team found Da'an and Lili. The soldiers began to question Da'an
 about Taelon experiments on Earth. Back at Taelon headquarters, Boone and
 Sandoval made it to the central processor, but Augur's plan fails. With
 worldwide disaster imminent, the huge Taelon mothership suddenly filled the
 sky, sending a wave of energy over Earth that was able to halt the virus.

 When the Taelon systems were completely restored, Boone confronted Doors about
 the foolishness of his plan. As Da'an and Lili recuperated from their ordeal
 with a new appreciation for each other, Da'an invited Lili to share a Taelon
 form of communication. While physically touching hands, they share thoughts
 and feelings in an intense way that leaves them both flushed with emotion.

 @{b}The Devil You Know [#17]@{ub} (1997)

 In a darkened laboratory, two military operatives examined the body of
 Thomas Blanchard, a career thief who was beaten brain dead in his jail
 cell. The body, suspended naked in a large tube, was preserved in a bluish
 fluid. Colonel Purcell debated with his colleague, ex-CIA agent Morris
 Carter, whether Blanchard was appropriate for their "purposes." Carter
 notes that Blanchard fit their required profile. To execute the operatives'
 plan, Blanchard was stretched out on an operating table, and long needles
 inserted into his head. The supposedly braindead patient opened his eyes,
 and Carter welcomed him back.

 William Boone, Captain Lili Marquette and FBI agent Ron Sandoval rendezvoused
 at the headquarters of Doors International where they met with Anne Portnoy,
 who took over the company when its founder, Jonathan Doors, went underground
 to run the resistance movement against the Taelons. Portnoy was joined by the
 Taelon leaders Da'an and Zo'or. Portnoy showed the group a new piece of
 Taelon-engineered weaponry, an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) device, used in
 information warfare. After an impromptu demonstration, Boone and Lili
 realized the new weapon was capable of wreaking untold havoc on Earth.
 Because it fired a beam which could destroy computer systems, the EMP could
 cause airline crashes, disable launched missiles or crumble the stock
 exchange. In the midst of the shock of seeing this new weapon, Lili received
 a phone call from her mother, Rachel Purcell, who informed Lili her father
 had died. Lili, who had been estranged from her father since her younger
 brother's suicide, took the news stoically.

 Boone met with Doors and Augur to warn them about the new weapon. Together
 they plotted to steal the EMP to prevent the Taelons or their allies from
 using it against Earth. Before the resistance could make its move, the
 reanimated Blanchard broke into Doors International and stole the EMP.

 Sandoval headed up a search team to find the missing weapon, while Boone
 played along in his role as Implant. This time Boone was operating for the
 resistance without Lili's help because Da'an had taken her off the case,
 ordering her to take time off to grieve over her father's death. Before
 anyone got a lead on the thieves, Blanchard appeared at Augur's lair offering
 to sell him the EMP. Augur set up a phony sale to Jonathan Doors, whom he set
 up as the highest bidder.

 At her father's funeral, Lili and her mother tried to heal old wounds. Augur
 discovered the identity of the EMP seller, but Blanchard's background as a
 petty thief did not seem to fit the profile of a major arms dealer. Even
 though she had been pulled off of the case, Lili took matters into her own
 hands by sneaking into Blanchard's hideout, where he was waiting with Carter
 and another gunman. The men discovered Lili and took her hostage. Blanchard
 found a moment alone with Lili, and revealed to her that he is really Colonel
 Purcell, her father. When he explained that his mind had been transplanted
 into the body of a former convict, Lili refused to believe him.

 Da'an revealed to Boone that the whole EMP theft was a set-up to lead the
 Taelons to Jonathan Doors. Boone realized the Taelons might kill Doors before
 he could get away to warn him of the plot. Carter and Blanchard left their
 hideout to make the EMP transaction at resistance headquarters. Alone with a
 gunman, Lili managed to overpower him and escape. Knowing that the entire
 resistance could be destroyed, Lili raced to the meeting with Doors. Boone and
 Sandoval were close to the secured site, but Boone could not reveal the secret
 lair to Sandoval without giving himself away; Lili was on her own. Underground
 in the resistance headquarters, Blanchard ambushed Doors, and a shoot-out
 ensued between the two men. Doors took a bullet in the leg, but Blanchard
 received a fatal shot to the chest. As he died in Lili's arms, Blanchard
 finally reconciled with his daughter.

 She couldn't help wondering, though, how much of the man she came to know
 and respect was her father's mind, and how much of it was the influence of
 Thomas Blanchard's body.

 @{b}Law & Order [#18]@{ub} (1997)

 The Taelon scientist Rho'ha was going to stand trial for murder in
 Washington, the first time a Companion was subjected to a human court of law.
 Rho'ha had allowed himself to be transfused with DNA from Army Captain Lucas
 Johnson in a biological experiment.

 The Taelon was accused of murdering Major Raymond McIntyre, Johnson's
 commanding officer, when the soldier confronted Rho'ha in Johnson's hospital
 room. Rho'ha's secret experiment hadn't been revealed to the public, so Da'an
 appointed William Boone and Agent Ron Sandoval as Rho'ha's lawyers. Another
 complication for the Companions was that the prosecutor for the case was New
 York District Attorney Joshua Doors, the estranged son of resistance leader
 Jonathan Doors. Joshua Doors told reporters at the outset of Rho'ha's trial
 that he would seek the death penalty.

 Boone and Sandoval made a shaky defence team. Boone wanted better legal
 counsel for Rho'ha, but Sandoval insisted there was too much sensitive
 information at stake to involve a non-Implant. Unbeknownst to Boone and
 Sandoval, there was a real security risk. Travis Perkins was a delusional
 Companion supporter and was determined to kill anyone who threatened Rho'ha's
 life. Behind the scenes, the Taelon Synod instructed Da'an that if Rho'ha
 received a prison sentence he must die anyway, since he knows too much and
 poses too great a security risk to the Taelon's presence on Earth since he was
 no longer part of the Taelon Commonality.

 Sandoval told Rho'ha their strategy would be self-defence, since McIntyre
 attacked Rho'ha in the hospital room first. Boone wanted to reveal the DNA
 experiment as proof that Rho'ha wasn't responsible for his actions because he
 was temporarily insane, reacting to events as a human would, in a total rage.
 But Sandoval vetoed the idea. Rho'ha had undergone procedures to remove the
 DNA from his system, but he admits he is not entirely rid of Captain
 Johnson's hatred and rage.

 On the first day of the trial, the Taelon Zo'or ordered Sandoval to place
 him on the jury. Sandoval succeeded, but Joshua Doors had his own ace up
 his sleeve.

 Lili Marquette, a partial witness to the murder, was ready to testify for the
 prosecution. When Lili and Joshua discussed strategy, they experienced a
 surprising undercurrent of attraction and Joshua decided to confide in Lili
 about his troubled relationship with his father. Once on the stand, Lili
 bolstered Joshua's case, though Boone diminished her testimony through
 cross-examination. When Rho'ha took the stand, Joshua confronted him about the
 secret DNA experiment and Rho'ha become enraged and lunged for Joshua,
 threatening to kill him. The entire courtroom saw Captain Johnson's features
 ripple across Rho'ha's contorted face. When court recessed, the psychopath
 Perkins, enraged at Joshua's treatment of Rho'ha, attempted a suicide bombing
 to kill the prosecutor. But Perkins was foiled because Joshua was
 inaccessible, surrounded by reporters and his bodyguard Willie.

 The entire world was talking about the Taelon's secret DNA experiments and
 the revelation works in Rho'ha's favour, since the consensus on the jury was
 that he wasn't responsible for his actions. The jury was ready to acquit him
 when Zo'or made his own revelations to seal Rho'ha's fate. He told the jury
 members that Taelons are impervious to bullets and, reverting to his blue
 energy state, showed them that Taelons cannot be shot to death. The jury now
 believed that Rho'ha was never in any real danger and reversed their
 decision, sentencing the Taelon to death. Outside the courthouse, Joshua
 discusses the verdict with reporters when Perkins reappeared. He grabbed
 Joshua, ready to detonate his explosives, but Boone fired his Skrill,
 blasting Joshua out of harm's way. Perkins set off the detonator, killing
 himself and Joshua's bodyguard.

 Joshua met with Boone again in court to respond to Boone's motion that the
 death penalty be set aside. In a last attempt to save Rho'ha's life, Boone
 argued that the death penalty could only be applied to human verdicts and
 defendants since humanity doesn't have the right to decide to kill an alien
 who they know so little about. Boone succeeded in delaying the sentence, but
 the aliens had already decided their own path of justice. In a Taelon
 ceremony, Rho'ha released his life energies, an act of altruism the Taelons
 not only understand, but expect.

 @{b}Through The Looking Glass [#19]@{ub} (1997)

 The Taelons introduced interdimensional travel for human customers. Jamie
 Sims, a young deaf-mute boy, and his mother Anna, were two of their customers
 en route to New York. They entered the interdimensional portal at the Los
 Angeles airport, but something went wrong during their journey. Anna arrived
 in New York, but Jamie was missing. William Boone and Agent Ron Sandoval
 arrived to calm the hysterical mother and find her son. They were well aware
 that there would be mass hysteria if Anna told the press about the accident.
 Dr. Walken, the scientist in charge of the portal, seemed equally unnerved by
 Jamie's disappearance. As Sandoval threatened Anna into silence, Jamie
 reappeared in the portal, disoriented but unharmed. All were shocked when
 Jamie, suddenly able to speak and hear, called out to his mother.

 The Taelon Synod was in an uproar about the witnesses to Jamie's disappearance
 and transformation, knowing they posed a greater risk of exposure. Da'an faced
 off with Zo'or about the real reason the Taelons had offered interdimensional
 travel to humans. Selected people were being whisked out of interdimensional
 stasis for experiments and fertilization. For the time being, the Synod backed
 Zo'or but Da'an had grave misgivings about the Companions' new activities.

 In the meantime, Boone took Jamie to be examined by Dr. Park, a resistance
 collaborator. Dr. Park discovered that Jamie had been implanted with an
 immature CVI, just powerful enough to restore his missing senses. Boone
 realized the Taelons were harvesting humans for experimentation. Unexpectedly,
 Boone's sister Sarah, in town on job interviews, announced she was three
 months pregnant. Learning that she travelled through the interdimensional
 portal, Boone was alarmed. Was Sarah pregnant from her last relationship, or
 had the Taelons somehow impregnated her? Before Boone could get answers from
 Dr. Walken, he discovers the doctor had apparently committed suicide.

 In reality, Sandoval's men had killed Walken, who was ready to go public
 about the Taelon conspiracy. Working with Captain Lili Marquette, Boone was
 able to find Walken's hidden records, which gave him unauthorized entry into
 the interdimensional portal. After meeting with Jonathan Doors and Augur, the
 resistance agreed to let the research scientist Sahjit Jinnah pose as a
 decoy. They're sure he'd be selected by the Taelons since his high I.Q. made
 him an appealing subject. As the resistance prepared for their infiltration,
 Boone asked Sarah to see Dr. Park to find out if her pregnancy had been
 affected by the Taelons. Dr. Park had also outfitted Sahjit with a tracking
 device so the resistance could monitor him wherever he went in
 interdimensional travel. At the same time, Sahjit would remain conscious
 through his travels, unlike other passengers.

 As predicted, Sahjit was chosen by the Taelons and was brought to a secret
 laboratory where he saw other subjects suspended in stasis as the Taelons
 pursued their studies. Frightened by being cut from his link to underground
 headquarters, he escaped into the surreal surroundings, completely alone.
 Meanwhile, Dr. Park informed Sarah that she was not three months pregnant, but
 had been fertilized with a fast-developing fetus during her transportation.
 Overwhelmed, Sarah fled. In search of his sister, Boone entered the portal
 where he met Sandoval, who had been alerted that one of the Taelons' subjects
 had escaped. Upon their arrival at the Taelon lab, Boone and Sandoval saw the
 dozens of human experimentation subjects including, to Boone's horrific
 surprise, Sarah. Zo'or confirmed that Sarah was implanted with a Taelon
 engineered fetus and Boone had to feign implant disinterest while trying to
 save both his sister and Sahjit. Unsuccessful in his attempts, Sarah suddenly
 disappeared through the portal and Sandoval captured Sahjit, who discovered
 that the Taelon lab was actually based on the moon.

 Sahjit was brought to Taelon headquarters where he was grilled by Sandoval,
 Zo'or and Da'an who suspected his connection to Doors and the resistance.
 When Sahjit refused to cooperate he was sent back to the Taelon lab by
 Zo'or to be tortured.

 Unobserved, Da'an placed a tiny device on the back of Sahjit's neck. Although
 a group of resistance operatives attempted to free Sahjit, Sandoval managed to
 drag him into the interdimensional portal. But at the end of the journey,
 Sandoval found himself in the Taelon lab without Sahjit, who had mysteriously
 arrived safely in Los Angeles. Upon examination, the resistance discovered the
 device Da'an secretly affixed to him. Boone and Lili discussed Sahjit's theory
 that Da'an deliberately helped Sahjit escape by giving him this device that
 masked his genetic code while in the portal.

 Lili located Sarah in a Los Angeles hospital and Boone, concerned for his
 sister's well-being, takes her to Dr. Park who confirms that Sarah had lost
 her baby. Boone now realized the fetus was harvested during interdimensional
 stasis. As he said goodbye to his sister, Boone knew he had not fully
 convinced her that her pregnancy was part of a Taelon experiment.

 Still trying to get more on the Taelon agenda, Boone met again with Jamie
 Sims, who was still enjoying his new-found gifts of hearing and speech.
 Jamie, as planned by the Companions, was registered to study at the Taelon
 Science Academy. Although Jamie had benefited from the Taelons' experiments,
 Boone remained deeply concerned about the future of all who have travelled
 through the portal.

 @{b}Infection [#20]@{ub} (1997)

 It was code red at a Taelon research laboratory when Ne'eg succumbs to a
 devastating virus which was the result of being infected by an airborne agent
 while working around an alien probe. Kee'sha, the Taelon in charge of medical
 security, was helpless in trying to save his colleague. Even the steely Zo'or
 is unnerved by Ne'eg's horrible condition. William Boone, Agent Ron Sandoval
 and Da'an arrived at the facility in time to see Ne'eg's gruesome demise.
 Unable to fight the virus, the Taelon's blue energy field waxed a deep
 greenish gold until his entire being crystalized and crumbled. The fact that
 the Companions had no defence against the biological onslaught warned Boone
 that the entire human race was at risk.

 Boone reported back to the resistance members, who were horrified at the
 infection's implications for Earth. Jonathan Doors was certain that the
 Taelons were conducting germ warfare and that Ne'eg was an unexpected
 casualty. Boone argued that the virus was a totally unknown agent since a
 Taelon was the first to die. While the fate of Earth and the Taelon race hung
 in the balance, another war was about to break out. The Brotherhood of the
 White Race had gained new strength and membership since the Taelons' arrival.
 Looking for a way to spread its message of hate, the group targeted the
 community of Lincoln Hills, the brainchild of the Reverend Billy Mitchell, a
 black activist who transformed the abandoned military base into a haven for
 the destitute and homeless. As journalist Albert Cooper broadcast an
 exclusive report from the compound, the white supremacists, led by Steven
 Burton and his son Charles, planned their attack. The supremacists descended
 on Lincoln Hills, burning, looting and terrifying the residents. The
 Brotherhood was caught in their horrendous act, but their next attack on the
 community would prove deadly.

 Dr. Belman worked with Augur to crack the mystery of the alien virus, which
 the resistance learned was engineered to kill. Unbeknownst to the Taelons, who
 were trying to contain the lethal germ in their lab, a member of the
 Brotherhood, Robert Howard, had joined their research team. Putting untold
 millions at risk, Howard stole a vial of the virus, identified as Athens "A"
 Culture. Meanwhile, the men who attacked Lincoln Hills had been sentenced to
 do community service as residents of the compound. Unbeknownst to Captain Lili
 Marquette, who delivered Howard and the others to Lincoln Hills, the
 Brotherhood planned to release the stolen virus and exterminate the compound's
 entire population. When they poured the stolen vial into the centre's drink
 dispenser, the Lincoln Hills pandemic begins.

 Within hours, residents fell sick with the virus. Dr. Belman raced against
 time to find a vaccine, but the outbreak wasn't confined to Lincoln Hills
 since the virus was airborne on the Taelon Mother Ship. Boone, Zo'or, Da'an,
 Sandoval and Quo'on were also infected and hours away from an excruciating
 death. Lincoln Hills had to be put under total quarantine or Earth's entire
 population would succumb. In an awesome gesture of cooperation, the Taelons
 placed their Home Ship over the compound, hoping to seal it off with a
 protective energy field.

 The Taelon manoeuvre fails, however, and the virus began to spread around the
 globe. In a flash of inspiration, Boone volunteered to use his CVI to increase
 his metabolism to create the first antibodies against the virus. Dr. Belman
 knew Boone was offering his life since the procedure could easily kill him.
 When it seemed that Boone would die before antibodies filled his bloodstream,
 Da'an lay his hands on Boone, sending energy coursing through Boone's body.
 Boone survived. Dr. Belman and Lili inoculated the Lincoln Hills patients and
 the vaccine was distributed throughout the world, stopping the infection. Dr.
 Belman was even able to alter the vaccine for use among the Taelons, although
 many were uncomfortable accepting it - including Zo'or.

 Working together, humans and Taelons had conquered the virus - but had their
 cooperation changed the Taelons in unknown ways? And what was the real origin
 of the probe which almost killed both species?

 @{b}Destruction [#21]@{ub} (1997)

 As Augur entertained a date, a holographic image of Rayna, the resistance
 scientist who had been consumed by the alien probe, appeared at the foot of
 his bed. The probe was now back in Taelon hands in a remote Russian outpost.
 Rayna told Augur that the Taelons had decoded the probe's secrets and were
 about to find out everything about the liberation movement. Augur was shocked
 at Rayna's appearance and message since the resistance thought she was dead.

 The holographic Rayna explained that her DNA was inside the probe and that her
 essence lived on. But as the Taelons dismantled the probe, they were also
 destroying Rayna's new entity and causing her incredible pain. She told Augur
 he had to retrieve the probe in order to save the resistance.

 Meanwhile, Joshua Doors, son of resistance leader Jonathan Doors, had been
 appointed the first Secretary of Human/Taelon Relations. The American
 Presidents Chief of Staff, Cy Vincent joined Da'an to welcome Joshua to his
 new cabinet level position, but it soon became clear to an agitated Agent
 Ron Sandoval that the younger Doors would be a very aggressive liaison
 between the two races.

 After hearing about Rayna's message, liberation scientist Sahjit Jinnah,
 Rayna's grieving fiance, was determined to get access to the probe to bring
 her back alive. But the Taelon lab was under the aliens' highest security,
 virtually impenetrable. Augur knew a specialist, Michael Sloane, who he
 believes can get underground operatives inside the compound. Sloane was a
 highly decorated former soldier, an honourable renegade who would take up
 someone else's fight - if the money was right.

 Joshua Doors continued to push the Taelons for more open dealings, but was
 frustrated by Sandoval at every turn. Joshua was equally frustrated in his
 blossoming relationship with Lili, who wants to take things slowly. For the
 time being, she was completely focused on getting to the probe.

 Inside the Taelon lab, Kee'sha used a data miner which unleashed the images
 stored in the probe's memory, including scenes from the resistance hideout.
 Kee'sha began to download the information.

 At resistance headquarters, Sahjit tried to use his computer to access the
 probe when Rayna's face flashed onto the screen. Rayna warned the rest of
 the resistance members that the probe was about to reveal all. She worked
 with the team to manipulate the probe's weapons systems from inside and
 succeeded in vaporizing Kee'sha.

 As the resistance team prepared for their assault on the lab, Joshua Doors
 met with Quo'on on board the Taelon mothership. Joshua pushed Quo'on to tell
 the truth about the probe and the devastating virus it released on Earth,
 but Quo'on remained enigmatic, promising only to ask the Synod about
 divulging more information.

 Using a variety of sophisticated devices, Sloane, Lili, Boone and Sahjit break
 into the Taelon compound with the goal of disabling the probe. Sahjit inserted
 into the probe a computer program specially designed to replicate Rayna, who
 then emerged from the probe in an aura of light. Rayna was back in human form,
 although she now had an alien biology. As the team programmed the probe to
 self-destruct, the Taelon security forces attacked. Sahjit was mortally
 wounded, but the team was able to get him back on the shuttle just as the
 Taelon facility explodes. Sahjit died on board, cradled in Rayna's arms. The
 loss of their friend and compatriot deeply affected the team, enough for Lili
 to call Joshua, perhaps for her own chance at love.

 @{b}The Joining [#22]@{ub} (1997)

 The Argonaut, a sophisticated naval salvage ship, hovered above a sunken ship
 out at sea. Captain Claude Bertrand had brought his crew to excavate a gold
 treasure, but what they found was a strange, radiant canister, hidden
 underneath the hold. Back on land, Bertrand stored his discoveries inside a
 secured warehouse. One of his crewmen, a young sailor named Randy, returned
 with a group of thieves to steal the treasure. Intrigued by the canister,
 Randy opened it and a green glowing tentacle shoots from the container and
 grabs him by the face. An alien being known as Ha'gel has been freed of his
 prison canister. Ha'gel assumed the form of Randy, leaving his victim's body
 behind, a crystalized husk. Randy's friends saw the transformation and drew
 their guns. Ha'gel released his shaqarava energy, blasting them into a million
 pieces. At Taelon headquarters, Da'an was relaxing in an energy shower when he
 bolted upright. The Taelon consciousness had been invaded by an intruder. The
 Taelons know Ha'gel had arrived.

 The next day, William Boone was called to the crime scene by his friend Sgt.
 Morovsky. Boone realized they were up against an unknown alien killer when he
 saw Taelon writing on Ha'gel's empty canister. Ha'gel, "wearing" Randy's
 identity, went to a bar, the Flat Planet Cafe, in fact, where he picked up a
 young woman. He took her back to her loft where he performed an alien mating
 ritual. The energies that Ha'gel/Randy released are so intense that they
 shattered the apartment and killed the woman. At the crime scene the next day,
 Boone and Morovsky were astounded at the destruction in the apartment, but the
 absence of trauma to the victim left them confused. They took the woman's body
 to Dr. Park, a Resistance sympathizer, who has already examined the real
 Randy's "husk" and was shocked to realize he wasn't dead.

 As the resistance members tried to find out more about Ha'gel from the
 Taelons, all they would tell Boone was that the alien was the last of a
 criminal caste, the end of his genetic strain. What the Taelons were hiding is
 that Ha'gel was the only survivor of a race which saved the Taelons from
 extinction, only to be destroyed by the Taelons themselves. Afraid that Earth
 would learn the truth, Quo'on and Zo'or enlisted Lt. Siobhan Beckett, the
 English Companion's Implant, to help eliminate Ha'gel. She had been following
 her own agenda, determined to prove Lili was working for the underground.

 The police force was also enlisted to help hunt down Ha'gel - a move that
 outraged Boone, since only a Skrill would be effective against the alien.

 Ha'gel/Randy was confronted by uniformed officers as they searched for him.
 Ha'gel blasted two police cars with his shaqarava, and secretly assumed the
 identity of Officer Reed. In Dr. Park's lab, Randy re-entered his body, but
 was unable to recall anything about his transformation. Ha'gel, now appearing
 as Reed, was at the scene of the shoot-out where Agent Ron Sandoval and had
 joined the investigation. Ha'gel/Reed leads Sandoval into the alley and
 assumed the FBI agent's identity in the same bizarre transformation.

 Beckett had stepped up her efforts to entrap of Lili and trailed her to the
 church above resistance headquarters. Unaware she was being followed, Lili
 entered the secret passageway. Uncertain of the exact location of the
 passageway, Beckett summoned Sandoval to the church. Unbeknownst to
 Beckett, Sandoval was now really Ha'gel. Underground, the resistance
 members realized Beckett is on the threshold of discovering their
 headquarters and they send for Boone.

 Meanwhile, Ha'gel/Sandoval brought Beckett under his power and performs his
 mating ritual with her in the church. Beckett is finally left crumpled on the
 floor. Boone arrived and realized that Ha'gel had taken over Sandoval's body.
 Boone confronted Ha'gel/Sandoval as Lili pulled Beckett to safety inside the
 resistance headquarters. Ha'gel/Sandoval fired on Boone as Boone tried to
 convince him that they were on the same side. Just as Ha'gel/Sandoval started
 to respond to Boone, Morovsky arrived with the police force. In the shoot-out
 that follows, Boone killed Ha'gel, but was badly wounded himself. Sandoval
 re-entered his body unharmed, but Boone's life hangs in the balance. Beckett
 survived the joining with Ha'gel, but was unconscious, and remained sheltered
 in resistance headquarters, now pregnant with the alien's offspring.

 Zo'or, Quo'on and Da'an debated the future of the Taelons on Earth. Then
 Zo'or and Sandoval went to Boone, who was on futuristic life support in a
 huge tank of blue fluid. As Sandoval watches, Zo'or eliminates Da'an's
 right-hand-man and friend, Boone.

 @{b}First Of Its Kind [#23]@{ub} (1998)

 After his battle with the alien renegade Ha'gel, William Boone's life hung
 precariously in the balance. Ha'gel was the last of the Kimera, a race that
 was a genetic predecessor to the Taelons. But before he was killed, Ha'gel
 fathered an offspring when he "joined" with the Taelon Security Implant
 Siobhan Beckett. Beckett was captured by the Liberation and while in their
 headquarters, she gave birth to a baby boy. She insisted that he be named
 Liam. Resistance members took the child from his mother and watched as he
 miraculously "morphed" into a full-grown adult in a matter of hours - his
 first words were his insistence that his name was Liam.

 The Resistance doctor, Melissa Park, reprogrammed Beckett's CVI-enhanced
 memory so that she had no recollection of the birth and her other experiences
 at Liberation headquarters. They released her back into the world to resume
 her duties protecting the Taelons.

 Meanwhile, an alien probe that first killed, then took on the form of
 Resistance member Rayna, emerged from its hiding place within the Resistance.
 It barged into a space communications centre and began sending a signal into
 deep space. Rayna then transformed completely back into the alien probe.

 At the same time, Agent Ron Sandoval broke the news to Captain Lili Marquette
 that William Boone died from the injuries he sustained while fighting Ha'gel.
 Da'an knew that, in reality, Zo'or had Boone eliminated.

 The Resistance had to faced the threat of the alien probe without Boone, but
 Liam - fully grown and possessing the memories of his ancestors - stepped up
 to get the Resistance through this dark hour. At Boone's funeral, the probe
 appeared and assassinated the Taelon Synod leader Quo'on, turning on Da'an as
 its next target. Liam rescued Da'an, who, in return, chose him as his personal
 protector. Da'an perceived that beneath Liam's human exterior, he had links to
 the Taelons. For this reason, Da'an permitted Liam to forgo a CVI implant,
 making Zo'or highly suspicious.

 As Zo'or and Da'an struggled over who would replace Quo'on as leader of the
 Taelon Synod, Secretary of Taelon/Human relations, Joshua Doors, travelled to
 the Mother Ship to find out about any danger to humanity from Quo'on's
 assassin. The Taelons told him about the Jaridians, an alien race that was
 hunting the Taelons to destroy them -- and would destroy Earth when they
 arrived. However, both the President of the United States and the Taelon Synod
 refused to let Joshua Doors go public with the information, fearing panic in
 the streets. The Taelons and their security agents set a trap for the
 replicant, although unbeknownst to Liam and Da'an, Zo'or and Sandoval
 sabotaged the plan so that Da'an would be killed. The un-implanted protector,
 Liam, would take the blame.

 The replicant continued its hunt for Taelons and found that Da'an was the only
 one still on the planet - as bait. Liam was at Da'an's office waiting to
 destroy it. He soon discovered that Da'an's escape route had been blocked and
 they were left alone with insufficient means to stop the alien probe. When
 everything looked blackest, Liam reaches deep within himself and found that
 his alien heritage had left him with an advantage.

 Liam was able to turn the replicant's deadly force back on itself by
 redirecting its weapon blast with his Shaqarava, an ancient power primitive
 Taelons were able to emit from their palms. Da'an saw for certain that Liam
 was part alien, but he kept the knowledge to himself. Da'an needed all the
 allies he could found when it was announced that the Synod chose his arch
 enemy Zo'or as their new leader.

 @{b}Atavus [#24]@{ub} (1998)

 Augur was given the job of keeping Major Liam Kincaid out of trouble. They
 spent time in Augur's loft watching a surveillance monitor trained on the Flat
 Planet Cafe, which Augur revealed he owned. Later, they enter the bar where
 they met up with Captain Lili Marquette and Kwai-ling. Lili teased the
 flirtatious Augur, saying that his overtures would never compete with her
 "joining" experience with Da'an, which enveloped her in the Taelon
 Commonality. Baited by Lili's comments, Augur returned to his lair and, using
 his sophisticated computer, found his own way to tap into the Taelon
 Commonality. He was immediately overwhelmed by the psychic sensations, unaware
 that his trespassing severed Da'an's own link to the Commonality.

 Da'an was in his office with Zo'or when his connection to the Commonality was
 broken. Da'an transformed into a hideous monster, a primitive ancestor of the
 Taelon species. He pushed past a startled Lili who just arrived on the scene
 and disappeared into the night. Zo'or informed Sandoval and Liam that Da'an
 regressed into an Atavus, a dangerous killer they must track down and destroy.

 Meanwhile, Augur, oblivious to the turmoil he created, stayed in his loft
 tapped into the Commonality, with a computer hologram that looked an awful
 lot like Lili monitoring his "visit." The real Lili refused to accept that
 Da'an could not be saved, but Zo'or insisted there was no way to reverse his
 regression. Agent Ron Sandoval insisted that she stop thinking of the Atavus
 as Da'an, and concentrate on eliminating the beast before it started
 killing. But the Atavus had already claimed its first victim - a mugger it
 encountered in the heart of the city. The Atavus moved on to claim its
 second victim. The Atavus "consumed" the hunter in a shower of light,
 leaving only his withered corpse behind.

 Siobhan Beckett joined Lili in the search for the Atavus, which they
 realized was heading straight for Augur's loft. What they didn't know was
 that Da'an was still inside the beast, and was trying to regain his lost
 link to the Commonality through the harmonic signal, which he traced to
 Augur. The agents converged on Augur's loft at the same time the Atavus
 arrived, and Sandoval was badly wounded during the ensuing melee. Lili was
 able to cover Sandoval and save Augur, but the Atavus disappeared into the
 night. The Atavus completely destroyed Augur's computer system, and Lili
 realized the only way to draw it out of hiding was to recreate the
 Commonality "harmonic" at Liberation headquarters.

 Beckett stayed in the hospital with the injured Sandoval, while Liam, Lili and
 Augur presented their plan to Resistance leader Jonathan Doors, who was
 outraged at the threat to their security. Doors finally backed down at Liam's
 insistence on saving Da'an. They set up the equipment to lure the Atavus
 toward Liberation headquarters, where another shoot-out ensued in the church
 yard above ground. Beckett arrived and wounded the Atavus with her Skrill,
 while Lili tried to reach out to Da'an's essence inside the beast. Liam
 arrived at Lili's side, and was able to approach, palms raised and Shaqarava
 glowing. The Commonality harmonic emanating from Liam penetrated the Atavus as
 he clasps hands with him and in an explosion of unearthly light and energy,
 the Atavus changed back into Da'an.

 Da'an was unscathed by his nightmare transformation, but the same can't be
 said of the relationship between Liam and Doors. The Liberation leader,
 ready to expel Liam from the group, waited to confront Liam upon his
 entering the hideout. But Doors and the Resistance members were astounded
 when Liam walked in, not alone, but with Da'an, thus opening a new chapter
 in their struggle against the Taelon occupation.

 @{b}A Stitch In Time [#25]@{ub} (1998)

 Major Liam Kincaid and Agent Ron Sandoval were on security duty before the
 opening of a major museum exhibit commemorating the Taelons' arrival on Earth.
 Liam admired a Taelon archway, which suddenly began to hum and glow. When he
 placed his palm against a symbol embedded in the structure, he suddenly
 disappeared into the archway. Almost immediately, Liam was ejected from the
 archway, landing dazed and confused on the museum floor. He realized that time
 had elapsed in his absence, and the strange experience made him worried about
 his friends. Liam raced to Liberation headquarters where he was horrified to
 found the entire group lying dead on the floor, victims of a gun battle. He
 accessed the computer to found out that two days had passed since he
 disappeared in the archway. Returning to the museum, he re-entered the archway
 and went back in time two days, reappearing in the present, but terrified of
 what he'd seen in the future.

 Zo'or instructed Sandoval to found out more about the suspicious bond between
 Liam and Da'an. Zo'or and Sandoval proceeded to a medical research centre
 where a major clinical breakthrough pioneered by Dr. Jeremy Brill was being
 announced. Brill was able to manipulate brain waves to cure mental illness.
 But it soon became obvious that the Taelons were forcing him to use the
 procedure in reverse, causing paranoia and mental breakdown in other patients.

 Liam sought out Augur, who was the one person missing from the massacre at
 Liberation headquarters. Augur told Liam to trust no one until they could
 pinpoint the murderer. But Liam had a disturbing dream which revealed him to
 be the killer, leaving him completely distraught and fearing his complex
 alien/human make-up would cause him to turn on his friends.

 Jonathan Doors, highly suspicious of Liam ever since he brought Da'an to
 their sanctuary, was growing increasingly agitated and paranoid, alarming
 Captain Lili Marquette. Lili was even more worried when Augur told her Liam
 believed he was destined to kill them. Liam, in turn, sought out Da'an for
 help, trying to found out if he could change the future by using the power
 of the his Kimeran forefathers.

 We soon learn that Zo'or, in an attempt to destroy Liam, was beaming
 dangerous brain wave emissions to him from the Taelon mother ship. Augur
 discovered the Taelon offensive and tried to reach Liam, who, acting
 increasingly out of control, was back on security detail at the museum
 exhibit. Lili confided in Doors about Liam's dream of the massacre, but
 instead of offering support, Doors demanded that Resistance members shoot
 Liam on sight. Liam flew his shuttle to the Taelon mother ship, trying to get
 more information on the brain wave experiment, and was horrified to learn
 that he was indeed one of the targets.

 Liam went back to his quarters and was preparing to commit suicide using the
 Shaqarava, when Augur stopped him with some startling news. Augur revealed
 that when Liam was born, he copied Doors' DNA to give Liam an adult identity
 on Earth, meaning that Doors was the real target of the deadly brain waves.
 The two men recognize the danger to Resistance members who were locked
 underground with Doors. They raced to the hideout, broke through security and,
 in a hail of bullets, Liam disabled Doors, who had been driven to madness by
 the Taelon brain wave emissions.

 Liam convinced the others to sedate Doors, who was brought back to sanity with
 a reverse program created by Augur. A disaster avoided, Augur took possession
 of the Taelon archway, keeping the structure and its secrets in his control.

 @{b}Dimensions [#26]@{ub} (1998)

 Major Liam Kincaid took Augur on a clandestine trip on a Taelon shuttle to
 show him how the spacecraft worked. Unbeknownst to them, Liberation leader
 Jonathan Doors had sabotaged the craft, planning to kill Liam. Although Doors
 found out Augur was on board, he refused to abort his plans. An explosion
 while they are in interdimensional space made the craft veer out of control
 and the shuttle crash landed in a strange wilderness area. While their
 surroundings indicated they were still on Earth, Liam and Augur found
 themselves in a strange parallel dimension where they were suddenly
 confronted by an armed brigade.

 Leading the soldiers was a beautiful woman named Maiya, a commander among her
 Imerian people. As Maiya prepared to take her prisoners back to the camp, the
 group was confronted by Taelon fighters. The Imerians used strange weaponry to
 defeat the Taelon troops, with Liam making a daring manoeuvre to save Maiya's
 life. The prisoners were then taken back to Maiya's Imerian home base, where
 they were introduced to her husband Jason, who was also the Imerian's
 spiritual leader. Liam and Augur were stunned to see that Jason was a parallel
 identity of Taelon protector, Agent Ron Sandoval.

 Back on Earth, Da'an and Zo'or were embroiled in another confrontation about
 the Taelons' plans to enslave and bio-engineer their human hosts. Sandoval
 informed Da'an and Zo'or that Liam's craft had disappeared. In the parallel
 dimension, Liam and Augur investigated the Imerian's technology, which was
 remarkably advanced in contrast to their primitive way of living. They
 discovered the Imerians were fighting a Taelon invasion led by another Imerian
 warrior woman, Kayla, who was the parallel version of Lili Marquette.

 Imerian defenders and took everyone prisoner aboard the Taelon mother ship
 where the parallel Zo'or was in charge. Liam and Augur managed to escape back
 to the shuttle, but Augur was captured by another Taelon contingent. He was
 taken aboard the mother ship and met the parallel dimension's Da'an. Augur
 tried to convince Da'an that on their own Earth, he was a benevolent Taelon
 who respected humanity. Meanwhile, Liam met up again with Maiya who had
 escaped from the massacre and they flew the damaged shuttle to the mother
 ship to rescue their friends. Once on board, Liam and Maiya were quickly
 detected and taken to the Taelon leaders for questioning. As Kayla
 interrogated Maiya, we learned they were sisters, estranged by their
 different allegiances. Liam was taken to the parallel Da'an, who sensed the
 truth in Liam's story of another reality on a different Earth and agreed to
 help the travellers return to their world.

 Augur managed to repair the shuttle sufficiently for interdimensional flight
 as Maiya, Jason, Liam and the other Imerians made it back to the spacecraft.
 As Kayla and her forces confronted the fugitives at the landing bay, Jason
 was mortally wounded. The parallel Da'an let Liam and Augur leave, along with
 Maiya who insists on joining them because of her promise to the dying Jason
 to honour their debt to Liam.

 Liam and Augur try to convince the Imerians to let them help in the impending
 assault. The Imerians discover evidence that Liam is a Companion agent. Jason
 had them imprisoned, but then decided to set them free in exchange for saving
 Maiya's life. Liam and Augur made their way back to their damaged shuttle with
 the hope of repairing it and returning to Earth, but Liam decided instead to
 return to the Imerian camp to help fend off the Taelon attack.

 @{b}Moonscape [#27]@{ub} (1998)

 Augur was in Russia attempting to buy top research secrets from a failed
 research scientist named Dr. Smerdyakov when the two men were captured by
 the police. Back in America, Augur's computer-generated companion, a
 holographic Captain Lili Marquette, received his distress signal and alerted
 Major Liam Kincaid. When Liam consulted with Da'an, he learned that Augur
 and Smerdyakov had been convicted of treason by a Russian court and
 sentenced to die. The men sat in a jail cell awaiting execution when a
 mysterious figure appeared. The imposing man, Lazarus, told them that they
 would be spared if they "cooperated." When both men consented, Lazarus
 whisked them away to a Taelon scientific facility.

 Meanwhile, Agent Ron Sandoval spots the Imerian warrior and Liberation
 operative, Maiya, in a cafe. She stops cold at the sight of Sandoval,
 mistaking him for her dead husband Jason, his double in her parallel world.
 Something about the woman took Sandoval aback and he pursued Maiya, who fled.
 Sandoval, curiously attracted to Maiya, found her, but she ran away from him
 again at the sight of his Skrill. When Lili Marquette later met up with
 Sandoval, he ordered her to trace the mysterious Maiya, putting the whole
 Liberation movement at risk.

 Augur and Smerdyakov, still detained in a cell on board the mother ship,
 watched a pre-taped message from Zo'or which informed them that they were
 part of a bio-engineering project to create a warrior species capable of
 fighting the Jaridians. Lazarus put Augur through a series of tests to
 determine if he was a suitable candidate, even though Lazarus himself seemed
 to be suffering painful memories of his own indoctrination. Da'an and Liam
 arrived at the mother ship to inspect the project. Da'an challenged Zo'or
 about the morality of his plan. When the Synod leader could not be swayed,
 Da'an sent Liam into the facility to free Augur. It soon became apparent to
 Liam that Augur had already been programmed to become a killing machine. Liam
 sensed that Lazarus, who had admitted to being the program's first subject,
 was conflicted about the project. Curiously, Lazarus also seemed to know a
 lot about Augur and Da'an.

 On Earth, Lili and Maiya tried to keep Sandoval off Maiya's trail by finding
 her Earth "double". Scanning through computer records, they found her to be
 Isabel Martinez, an anthropologist currently working in the Amazon basin.

 They also make the connection that since Maiya and Kayla (Lili's double in the
 alternate dimension) were sisters, then Isabel must be Lili's sister on Earth.

 Back on board the mother ship, Zo'or, Sandoval, Liam and Da'an watched as
 Augur was pitted against another bio-engineered subject. Both Augur and his
 opponent were programmed to see each other as virtual Jaridians. Only after a
 violent battle does Augur realize he had been fighting Smerdyakov, whose mind
 had been transplanted into a young, healthy body.

 Suddenly, Smerdyakov collapsed as his new body rejected the transplants.
 When the subjects were removed from the battleground, Lazarus transferred
 Smerdyakov back into his old body and began to plot against the Taelon
 project.

 Liam later sneaked into Augur's cell to help him remember his real identity so
 he would want to return to his friends in the Liberation. Lazarus bursts into
 the room, but instead of fighting Liam, he helped him heal Augur. When they
 finally succeeded, Lazarus took Augur to a space shuttle and instructed Liam
 to get Da'an off the mother ship. In the medical laboratory, Smerdyakov had
 used the computer to deprogram the Taelon virtual glass barrier, setting off
 the destruction of the mother ship. As alarms went off, Sandoval prepared to
 evacuate Zo'or. Lazarus appeared, armed, and announced they would all die in
 the impending Armageddon.

 Augur was ready to fly to safety, but his sense of honour compelled him to
 rescue Liam from the mother ship. He hurried to a computer console where he
 hacked away, repairing the virtual glass shield with only seconds to spare. A
 Taelon guard burst into the room and fired at Lazarus, who died in Liam's arms
 as the destruction countdown stopped. Augur then fled to safety on Earth.

 With the mother ship saved, Sandoval called Lili to demand results on the
 search for Maiya. Lili told Sandoval that the woman he was searching for was
 an anthropologist named Isabel Martinez, and that her whereabouts were

 @{b}The Sleepers [#28]@{ub} (1998)

 Deep in the Australian outback, a scientist discovered a miniature space
 probe, which emitted a violent pulse of energy, killing the scientist.
 Meanwhile, on the Taelon mother ship, alien scientists were trying to trace
 a probe which sent out a frequency that had disrupted the Taelon
 Commonality. Without their shared psychic connection, the Taelons' life
 forces would be depleted, eventually killing all members of their race. The
 Taelon Synod leader, Zo'or, ordered Agent Ron Sandoval to do a worldwide
 "sweep" of suspected Resistance members, putting the American Liberation
 movement in jeopardy.

 At the Flat Planet Cafe, Augur held a spirited debate about material wealth
 with Maiya, who was working as a bartender at the Liberation hang out.
 Suddenly, riot police, led by Sandoval and Captain Lili Marquette, swarm the
 cafe. Sandoval, shocked to see Maiya, was drawn to her even in the midst of
 the pandemonium. He was furious with Lili, who lied to him about Maiya's
 whereabouts. Lili had tried to hide Maiya's true identity as an Imerian
 warrior from another dimension. Sandoval had been led to believe that Maiya
 was an anthropologist named Isabel Martinez who worked in Peru. In fact,
 Isabel was Maiya's double on Earth.

 Augur and Maiya were taken away with the other suspected Resistance members
 and imprisoned in a Taelon jail. Lili and Sandoval followed the prisoners and
 witnessed them being cut down by an energy force and taken to a lab in
 comatose states. Major Liam Kincaid confronted Da'an who admits the Taelons
 had begun "harvesting" their captives' psychic energy to mend a rupture in the
 Commonality. Da'an became concerned when he learned that Augur and Maiya were
 among the prisoners. Word about the Taelon "sweep" spread beyond Taelon
 headquarters where UN. Secretary to Taelon/Human Relations, Joshua Doors went
 public about the illegal detention of Earth's citizens. He vowed to fight for
 their release, at the same time intimating that his father, Liberation leader
 Jonathan Doors, may come out of hiding to make a bid for the U.S. Presidency.

 Maiya, Augur and the others lay hooked up to Taelon machinery which turns
 them into "sleepers," depleting their psychic energy and channelling it to
 the Commonality. In his unconscious state, Augur dreamed that he was walking
 the street of a suburban community where he encountered his dead father,
 Lincoln. Maiya pleads telepathically with Liam to save the prisoners, when
 she too was whisked into a dream world, rejoined with her dead mother
 Allegra. Allegra told Maiya it's the day of her wedding to Jason, Sandoval's
 double in the parallel dimension.

 While the prisoners' souls were happy in their dream worlds, Da'an went to the
 Taelon lab where he discovered that some of the subjects were close to death.
 Da'an confronted Zo'or, who insists he would continue to round up Resistance
 suspects and sap their psychic energy until they could repair the Commonality.
 Fearing for the lives of his friends, Liam took matters into his own hands. He
 went to Dr. Melissa Park, asking her to duplicate the Taelon procedure on
 himself so that he could attempt to find his friends on the psychic plane and
 bring them back. Dr. Park resisted, but Jonathan Doors ordered her to proceed.
 Before Liam was immersed into a "near death" state, Doors wishes him a safe
 mission, his earlier hostile feelings towards Liam obviously changed.

 With his life forces diverged into the Taelons' psychic field, Liam entered
 Maiya's dream world and interrupted her wedding to Jason. He pleaded with
 Maiya to return to Earth's reality, but she was so happy to be back with
 Jason, she refused. Back on Earth, Lili and Sandoval used the computer to
 narrow in on the Commonality rupture, which was being caused by the Jaridian
 probe in the Australian Outback. They fly in the shuttle to locate the probe
 and began a life and death struggle to destroy it. The probe deployed a
 defensive force field, as well as aggressive tentacles that struck out at Lili
 and Sandoval, eventually gaining a hold of Sandoval.

 As the other laboratory subjects began to flatline, Augur, Maiya and Liam
 hovered near death. Liam appeared in Augur's dream world, but failed to
 convince him to return to Earth to fight the Taelons. Liam was then summoned
 by his own father, Ha'gel. As Augur's dream world dissolved around them,
 Ha'gel tried to convince Liam to leave his earthly form to join with his alien
 ancestors in a swirling vortex of higher consciousness. As he struggled with
 his conflicted desires, the spiritual entities of Augur and Maiya, having left
 their dream worlds, appear, calling Liam back from the vortex.

 Meanwhile, in the Australian Outback, Lili rescues Sandoval from the probe's
 deadly grasp and destroys it with a detonation device. As Sandoval and Lili
 fly to safety in the shuttle, the probe's destruction repairs the rupture to
 the Commonality. The "Sleepers" in the Taelon lab were able to re-enter their
 bodies and burst free of their bonds, aided by Augur and Maiya, who destroyed
 the entire lab. Zo'or and Da'an were elated when they realized the threat to
 the Taelons was over.

 @{b}Fissures [#29]@{ub} (1998)

 As two technicians tested a new interdimensional pathway from New York to
 Bangkok, a strange glowing light appeared, then hid inside a control panel.
 One of the men stayed behind to make some adjustments and was attacked by a
 creature, which was attracted by the energy emitted by the technician's
 power tool.

 Da'an and Major Liam Kincaid interviewed the surviving technician to
 establish the cause of his co-worker's death. In the background was a TV
 tuned into an interview with U.S. President Thompson, who was discussing his
 platform with newswoman Catherine Shaw. Suddenly, the broadcast broke up as a
 power outage hit, but this went unnoticed by Liam and Da'an who were
 engrossed in their own discussion.

 On board the Taelon mothership, President Thompson warned Agent Ron Sandoval
 about the spreading power blackouts hitting all parts of the country. Sandoval
 bluntly asked Zo'or if the Taelons were responsible. Zo'or denied the
 accusation. Meanwhile, Liam went to Augur and tested his theory that the
 blackouts were only occurring in cities with portal terminals. Augur agreed
 that this was too much of a coincidence. Captain Lili Marquette told Sandoval
 and Zo'or that Earth's engineers were tracing the crisis to an incompatibility
 as Taelon systems mesh with human systems. She added that the engineers were
 racing to put a series of buffers in place in an attempt to restore power.

 Liam met with Dr. Park, who was examining the dead technician's body. They
 found small puncture wounds in his flesh consistent with bite marks. Following
 a hunch, Liam went to the portal terminal to inspect the crawlspace where the
 technician died. He removed the facing on a power unit and found it infested
 with tiny glowing creatures feeding off the power source. Liam took one of the
 creatures to Augur and they examined its strange biology. They started to
 suspect that the creatures had arrived from another dimension and that they
 would destroy every power source on Earth, including the energy-based Taelons.

 As the power crisis spread globally, President Thompson and the Taelons
 tried to reassure Earth's people and their governments. But there was an
 obvious crisis of confidence as world leaders started to demand the removal
 of Taelon systems from their countries. Sandoval still harboured suspicions
 that the creatures were part of a Taelon plot and he commanded Lili to help
 him access top secret files.

 While searching through Taelon security files, Lili grew increasingly confused
 and concerned by Sandoval's orders, realizing he was following his own agenda.

 Meanwhile, Liam and Augur tried to trace the true origins of the creatures,
 which Da'an had told them were unknown to the Taelons. As these creatures
 grew and multiplied in horrifying numbers, they devoured Earth's energy
 sources, wreaking havoc and causing hundreds of deaths. Liam and Augur
 devise a plan to return the creatures to their own dimension, using a space
 shuttle to draw them into a portal.

 On board the mothership, Sandoval informed Zo'or about the creatures' threat
 to the Taelons. Zo'or ordered the mothership sealed, but his orders came too
 late. The ship was already infested with creatures which began to kill off the
 Taelons. To protect themselves, the Taelons must stop emitting energy by
 putting themselves into a near-death state of "Sahmbaad." Sandoval swore to
 protect the Taelons in their vulnerable state and to captain their ship until
 the creatures were destroyed. But Sandoval was still following his own secret
 agenda, and Lili caught him using strange equipment on Zo'or's silent body.

 Liam got clearance to land on the mothership and he retrieved one of the
 craft's huge power coils - the strongest power source on Earth. He hooked it
 up to the shuttle, then he and Lili piloted the jerry-rigged machine down to
 New York City where they hovered above a skyscraper and activated an energy
 stream into one of the interdimensional portals. Betting that they could
 channel the creatures back to their dimension by baiting them with the power
 from the mothership coil, they saw the creatures slowly begin to arrive. But
 the shuttle itself was being destroyed by the creatures and the stress of the
 huge power coil. Lili slid down a rope to safety onto the roof, but Liam had
 to stay on board the dangerous craft to keep the portal open. Once all the
 creatures had been drawn to the shuttle, Lili gave the "all clear," and Liam
 jumped to safety as the shuttle exploded into a million pieces.

 Lili returned to the mothership to confront Sandoval about his covert
 activities, but he admitted nothing, and demanded her continued obedience. As
 she spied on him from the bridge, she saw that Sandoval had copied Zo'or's
 handprint, giving him access to the Taelon leader's personal files. She was
 left to wonder where Sandoval's loyalties lay.

 @{b}Redemption [#30]@{ub} (1998)

 Captain Lili Marquette and Jonathan Doors met in the Liberation hideout to
 examine a computer graphic of a CVI-implanted brain. Major Liam Kincaid
 joined them and realized they were discussing Siobhan Beckett, the Taelon
 security officer who gave birth to Liam after "joining" with the renegade
 alien, Ha'gel. Lili and Doors informed Liam that Beckett's CVI had broken
 down, destroying her will to serve the Taelons and endangering her life. Liam
 then learned that Beckett was missing, and he swore to find her before the
 Taelons tracked her down.

 Beckett, an expert cave climber, had journeyed deep inside her favourite cave,
 seeking to clear her mind of its new conflicting thoughts. As she scaled the
 slippery walls, her degenerating CVI took a turn for the worse and her ear
 began to bleed. Distracted, she lost her balance and fell onto a ledge.
 Knocked unconscious, Beckett lapsed into a hallucinogenic dream, in which
 Da'an appeared, announcing that she was on trial for crimes against humanity
 for her collaboration with the Taelons. If she was found guilty she would be
 executed, but if she was found innocent she would be set free to start a new
 life. Jonathan Doors appeared as the prosecution, charging that Beckett gave
 up her free will to join the Taelon forces, and was committed to furthering
 their agenda to enslave the people of Earth.

 Another figure emerged in Beckett's hallucinogenic trial -- Captain Liam
 Kincaid for the defence. Liam argued that Beckett joined the Taelons after
 they united Ireland in peace, which had been her prime goal in her previous
 service as an Irish anti-terrorist operative. Doors then called Lili Marquette
 as a witness. She testified to Beckett's unswerving allegiance to the Taelons
 and her determination to kill any resistors. Doors and Lili recounted several
 incidents which illustrate Beckett's ruthless drive and blind subservience to
 her Taelon masters. Liam prepared a rebuttal.

 Meanwhile, in the real world, Liam went to Augur to help in the search for his
 mother. Knowing that Beckett probably headed for a cave, Augur tapped into
 Beckett's personal files containing her climbing journal.

 Augur discovered that Beckett's favourite cave was in the Austrian Alps and
 Liam hurried to find her. Aboard the Taelon mother ship, Agent Sandoval was
 confronted by Zo'or. Aware that Beckett's CVI was malfunctioning, Zo'or
 demanded that Sandoval find and kill her.

 As Beckett lay in her deep hallucinatory state, Doors called Sandoval as his
 next witness, who testified about Beckett's model performance as a security
 implant. Liam countered with personal questions about Beckett's attraction to
 Sandoval, and her decidedly "human" reactions to their encounters. Beckett's
 mother then took the stand, telling the court about her daughter's dream of
 peace for her war-torn nation, and her desire to bring her own children into a
 better world. Liam then made Beckett take the stand, where she recounted her
 career as an anti-terrorist agent in Ireland. Beckett admitted she willingly
 killed opponents first for her country, then for the Taelons until, despite
 her CVI implant, she began to question the Taelons' motives. Doors compared
 Beckett's obedience to the Taelons with the Khmer Rouge and the killing fields
 of Pol Pot's regime. In his final summation, Liam told the court that Beckett,
 like much of humanity, made mistakes while dreaming of a better future.

 Da'an weighed Doors' and Liam's arguments and announced the judgement. He felt
 that Beckett acted in the true belief that she was bettering the world for her
 fellow human beings, but was still responsible for her actions. Finding her
 guilty, he did change the sentence, however. He assured her that she would not
 die alone and adjourned the court. Liam found Beckett just as she came out of
 her hallucination. She pleaded with him to fight the Taelons and save the
 planet. After voicing her final regret that she never had a child, Liam
 decided to channel his alien energies into her brain, allowing her to relive
 his birth. Exonerated of her collaboration with the Taelons and happy in her
 memories of motherhood, Beckett dies in Liam's arms. As Liam swore to avenge
 her death, he looked up to see Sandoval, and wondered how many of their
 confessions and promises he had heard.

 @{b}Between Heaven And Hell [#31]@{ub} (1998)

 In the Taelon mother ship laboratory, technician Peter Bellamy worked to
 extract DNA from an alien subject. On another level of the space craft, Zo'or
 and Da'an argued about Da'an's current bioengineering experiment to accelerate
 human evolution. Zo'or told Da'an he'd fight this project to the end, but
 Zo'or was actually sabotaging the results by tainting Da'an's serum with the
 alien's DNA. Back in the lab, the alien subject suddenly awakened from
 sedation and began to wreak havoc. The Taelons flooded the lab with
 anaesthetic gas and order was restored long enough for Agent Ron Sandoval to
 warn Bellamy that he must carry through Zo'or's plan.

 Da'an met Dr. Belman and her scientist daughter, Joyce, at a genetic research
 facility where they would introduce their experiment to an eager public. The
 team first talked about miraculous Taelon regenerative abilities. Next, they
 brought "Max," a severely injured chimp, to the stage and, following an
 injection of Da'an's Taelon serum, demonstrated how the primate was able to
 regenerate his damaged organs.

 Meanwhile, as Dr. Belman announced to the ecstatic audience that they were
 awaiting Presidential sanction for the procedure to be used on humans, UN.
 Secretary to Taelon/Human Relations Joshua Doors told President Daniel
 Thompson that he'd fight his approval of the experiments to the bitter end.
 When the President refused to take his threat seriously, Joshua resigned
 his position, telling him he'd manage the campaign of another presidential
 contender.

 In the Texas research facility, Major Liam Kincaid introduced himself to Dr.
 Joyce Belman as the enthusiastic audience surrounded her mother, barraging her
 with questions. Joyce told Liam that her mother had been blocking her
 involvement with the project, despite her scientific qualifications. It became
 clear that while Joyce was eager to try the experiment on a human subject, Dr.
 Belman was not. When Da'an informed Dr. Belman that Zo'or was trying to block
 the project and pushed her to try the serum on a human subject, she refused,
 widening the chasm between mother and daughter.

 Back in his cage at the animal testing facility, Max became increasingly
 violent. Unbeknownst to Dr. Belman, Max was injected with the tainted serum,
 causing his unexpected behaviour.

 Joyce, determined to prove herself to her mother and her Taelon superiors,
 sneaked into the lab, cut open her arm, and injected herself with the same
 serum. She was flooded with powerful sensations and watched, amazed, as she
 healed herself.

 Marquette joined Dr. Belman to check on the ape's condition. Dr. Belman told
 her that Joyce didn't report back to the lab, so she didn't know about the
 setback with Max. Meanwhile, Joyce revisits a childhood haunt which holds
 beautiful memories of happy times with her mother. Liam, responding to her
 invitation to join her, noticed her changed appearance. She admitted
 injecting herself with the Taelon genetic accelerant. At first, Joyce
 refused Liam's request to go back with him to the lab, but she finally gave
 in. When Dr. Belman tried to convince her daughter to submit to testing,
 Joyce told her she knew all about her Liberation activities because the
 alien DNA had given her acute psychic powers. Sandoval arrived and took
 Joyce to Zo'or for questioning.

 Joshua Doors held a press conference where he announced that his father,
 Liberation leader Jonathan Doors, would run for president. Hearing the
 announcement which was supposedly made on his behalf, Doors was aghast, but
 Lili and Augur advised him to consider the option. Back on board the mother
 ship, Zo'or and Sandoval grilled Joyce about the effects of the alien DNA, but
 Joyce's powers had grown far beyond those of the Taelons, and she escaped.
 Sandoval pursued Joyce and tried to shoot her with his Skrill, but she was
 immune to its blasts, allowing her to take Zo'or and the ship hostage. In
 fact, Joyce had cut off all power to the mother ship, intent on sending it
 crashing to Earth, eliminating all human and Taelon life. Da'an and Liam tried
 to reason with her, but she had destroyed the ship's interdimensional drive,
 putting it on a collision course with oblivion.

 Liam met with Da'an in an attempt to understand Joyce's transformation. Da'an
 told Liam that the Taelons and Jaridians used to be one race, but split apart
 on different evolutionary paths. Joyce now held all the vital DNA components
 of both races, making her a formidable adversary. Now she wanted to "join"
 with Liam to make a new race. At first he refused, but then realized that he
 might be able to kill her desire to destroy the world if he does "join" with
 her, thereby reminding her of her humanity. Lili, who was on the mother ship,
 contacted Augur in the hope that he could repair the interdimensional drive
 unit. Seconds before the ship would crash into Earth, Lili and Augur's
 efforts succeeded, and the mother ship veered off into interdimensional
 flight. Liam and Joyce ended their "joining" and Joyce emerged free of her
 malevolence, a newly sensitive being. With disaster averted, Joyce returned
 to the animal research facility and took Max's head in her hands, healing
 him. Then Joyce reconciled with her mother before disappearing into
 interdimensional space. That same night, Jonathan Doors accepted his son's
 challenge to run for President.

 @{b}Isabel [#32]@{ub} (1998)

 Major Liam Kincaid dropped by to see Maiya who was struggling to learn her
 new job as a bartender at the Flat Planet Cafe. Suddenly, overcome by pain
 and weakness, Maiya began to dimensionally "phase" and lose cohesion. Liam
 was horrified to see that Maiya might not be able to survive outside of her
 parallel world. Captain Lili Marquette met with Augur seeking information
 about the parallel universe and about her double who existed there -
 Maiya's sister Kayla. Lili also wanted background on Isabel Martinez,
 Maiya's double on Earth who, theoretically, could be Lili's sister. Augur
 told Lili that since Maiya's presence in their dimension violated the
 physical laws of the universe, neither Maiya nor Isabel would survive in
 the same universe unless they "merge."

 Agent Ron Sandoval, the dimensional double of Maiya's dead husband Jason,
 tracked Maiya to the Flat Planet Cafe and ordered Lili to bring her to the
 Taelon mother ship. Liam told Lili to watch out for Maiya while he went to
 search for Isabel Martinez. Liam travelled to an Inuit village where Isabel, a
 cultural anthropologist, was meeting with the community's elders. Isabel
 admits she has been suffering from mysterious seizures, which Liam explained
 by telling her about Maiya. Though she was suspicious and afraid, Isabel
 finally agreed to travel with Liam to met with Maiya.

 Meanwhile, Jonathan Doors officially left the Liberation as he publicly
 launched his bid for U.S. president. Augur bought the underground
 headquarters to use as his home on the condition that Doors could use it as
 a stronghold should the need arise.

 Liam summoned Augur to met with Isabel and Lili to assist in "merging" Maiya
 and Isabel. Lili reported that Maiya was on board the mother ship and that in
 her presence. Sandoval's CVI was picking up interference from across
 dimensions - Jason's memories of his life with Maiya and the parallel world.
 The team members realized they must get to Maiya fast. They arranged to
 accompany Jonathan Doors in the guise of his security contingent as he
 prepares to discuss his candidacy with the Taelon leader Zo'or aboard the
 mother ship. Before they began their mission, Lili showed a picture of her
 father to Isabel, who recognized him as her own father. Lili must confront the
 fact that her father had another life she never knew about.

 Sandoval grills Maiya about her associations on Earth. Though she was growing
 weaker, Maiya taunted Sandoval with comparisons to her husband.

 The Resistance team arrived on board the mother ship with Isabel disguised as
 a member of Doors' security detail. Doors met with Zo'or who offered to
 endorse his candidacy if Doors would support the Taelon bio-engineering
 program. Doors told Zo'or he would never join sides with the Taelons.
 Meanwhile, Liam put the diversion plan into action by sabotaging a shuttle in
 the landing bay, causing it to burst into flames. When Sandoval and Lili
 responded to the emergency, Liam rushed Isabel to the lab where Maiya
 awaited. The women, shocked at seeing their identical being, pledged to help
 each other survive. As they reached out to one another they were consumed in
 a violent "merging" whirlwind. They both drop to the floor, neither one
 showing signs of life.

 At the landing bay where the shuttle fire was contained, Zo'or instructed
 Sandoval to return Doors to Earth. Maiya, now conscious, was the only one to
 survive the interdimensional merging. As Isabel lies dead, Maiya slipped into
 her security uniform and joined Doors' entourage as they boarded the shuttle.
 Sandoval found Isabel's body, and believing her to be Maiya, confronted Liam
 about her identity. Liam admits he brought "Maiya" back from another dimension
 without reporting it to Zo'or. Sandoval accused Liam of gross insubordination
 and vowed to see him imprisoned. But Liam countered that Da'an was fully aware
 of Maiya's presence leaving Sandoval fuming.

 Jonathan Doors caused irreparable damage to the Taelons when he appears on
 television to tell the public that Zo'or tried to buy him off. Doors vowed to
 uncover all of the Taelons' secret experiments and agendas. As Augur showed
 Liam and Maiya the conversions he had made to the former Liberation hideout, a
 grieving Lili entered and confronts Maiya, wanting to know why her sister died
 while Maiya lived. Maiya told Lili that Isabel's consciousness was inside her,
 and to prove it, consoled Lili with shared stories about their father.

 Sparrow, a scientific genius confined to a wheelchair, entered into a
 partnership with Da'an to invent new assistive technology for the disabled.
 Da'an brought Major Liam Kincaid to Sparrow's company, Artelligent, Inc., to
 discuss the bio-surrogates Sparrow had engineered with genetic information
 from a Jaridian replicant held by the Taelons. Sparrow planned to transfer his
 consciousness into a bio-surrogate to escape the prison of his body. While the
 men talked in Sparrow's office, a reporter sneaked into the bio-surrogate lab
 and photographed the inanimate bodies. The light from the flash activated one
 of the specimens, which grabbed the reporter in a steely grasp.

 Alerted to the trouble, Agent Ron Sandoval arrived at the lab and found the
 reporter and a guard, both dead. The bio-surrogate had escaped wearing the
 guard's clothes. Sandoval's investigation confirmed that the bio-surrogate was
 indeed alive and programmed with full Jaridian instincts, but was devoid of
 any consciousness of its own. When Sandoval met with Zo'or and Captain Lili
 Marquette, Lili discovers that Sandoval and Zo'or had been tampering with
 Da'an's benign research and had programmed the bio-surrogates into killing
 machines. Sandoval returned to Artelligent, Inc. to confer with Liam about
 capturing the bio-surrogate and to inform him of its lethal capabilities.

 Liam went to Augur who he found with Sparrow. They started a satellite scan to
 track the missing surrogate on Augur's computer, then headed to the Flat
 Planet Cafe, where Sparrow got his first glimpse of Maiya as she tended the
 bar. He was transfixed by her beauty as much as she was fascinated by his
 wheelchair, and they sparked off the beginning of a friendship.

 In another part of town, the bio-surrogate was in search of food. Entering a
 diner, he took a police officer's meal. The cop pulled his gun to arrest
 him, but the bio-surrogate calmly took the gun, shot the officer, then
 returned to the counter to eat his food. After leaving the diner, another
 cop chased him to a park, but using his Jaridian cloaking device, the
 bio-surrogate disappeared.

 President Thompson came on board the Taelon mother ship demanding to see
 Zo'or. He wanted to corroborate their stories since the public would find
 out that their president had endorsed the bio-surrogate project, despite
 its potential dangers.

 Back at Artelligent, Inc., Sparrow was informed that his project had been
 taken over by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a military operation. The news was
 devastating to Sparrow since his consciousness transfer was set for the next
 day and he wanted Maiya to see him in a new physical form.

 Meanwhile, the bio-surrogate continued to wreak havoc, killing another police
 officer. Lili leaked information about both killings to Doors, who went on
 national television to inform the American people about the Taelons' and
 President Thompson's complicity. But in fact, Doors was secretly plotting with
 Augur to access Sparrow's computer files to use the bio-surrogate technology
 for the Liberation cause. Sparrow, focused on Maiya again, asked Augur for
 help in completing his "transfer" into a bio-surrogate body.

 Liam investigated a third murder committed by the bio-surrogate. This time,
 the victim was a teen-age boy. Liam met with Sandoval, who informed him that a
 second bio-surrogate was missing from the lab. Sparrow had transferred his
 consciousness into the new body, unaware of the full Jaridian weaponry that
 had been programmed into the bio-surrogate. Liam met with Augur, who helped
 Sparrow with his "transfer," then went to the Flat Planet Cafe, following a
 hunch that Sparrow would go there to see Maiya. Liam arrived at the cafe and
 found Sparrow and Maiya together. But the rogue bio-surrogate burst into the
 bar and attacked Liam. It took all of Sparrow's and Liam's alien weaponry to
 kill the bio-surrogate. They finally succeeded, blasting it into a billion
 particles. But Sparrow didn't survive the encounter, and they discovered that
 the Taelons had lied and it was impossible to save him.

 @{b}Gauntlet [#34]@{ub} (1998)

 A powerful Jaridian being held for research aboard the Taelon mother ship
 escaped from the cryogenics lab when a power surge interfered with his
 containment tank. The Jaridian killed a lab technician and took Captain Lili
 Marquette hostage inside her shuttle, and forced her to fly off the mother
 ship. Agent Ron Sandoval sent Major Liam Kincaid in pursuit and Zo'or ordered
 Liam to shoot down Lili's shuttle.

 After disappearing into interdimensional space, both Lili and Liam's shuttles
 were drawn into a tractor beam that pulled them off course and inside a huge
 alien vessel. The Jaridian commanded Lili to follow him into the craft.
 They're stunned to see that the landing bay was filled with crewless alien
 vessels, some of which were corroded from eons of neglect. Liam's shuttle also
 landed in the docking bay. When he exited into the mysterious space ship he
 found the walls covered with writing and art, which he could interpret.

 As Lili and the Jaridian proceeded into the space vessel, they encountered a
 water-filled chamber where they were attacked by serpent-like creatures. Liam
 also stumbled into a water trap and when he fought off one of the serpents, he
 found it was a mechanical device. Struggling out of the water chamber, Liam
 was seen by the Jaridian who tried to kill him with a shaqarava blast. As they
 fought in vicious hand to hand combat, the Jaridian noticed Liam's shaqarava.
 Liam told the Jaridian that he was part Kimera and that the strange vessel
 belonged to the extinct alien race. Liam showed Lili and the Jaridian the
 writing on the wall and explained that the ship was a repository for the
 accumulated knowledge of the Kimera race. In order to gain the Kimera
 knowledge, they must prove themselves worthy by running a gauntlet to the core
 of the ship. Both Liam and the Jaridian know that the peaceful Kimera would
 not have designed such a lethal space craft and agree that the vessel's
 programming must have been corrupted.

 On the Taelon mothership, Da'an confronted Zo'or about the Jaridian's escape.
 Da'an demanded Zo'or's resignation as head of the Synod, since not only was it
 possible the Jaridian would bring interdimensional flight technology back to
 his home planet, but his contact with humans would allow him to tell the
 Jaridian's version of the conflict between the two alien species. Zo'or sent
 Sandoval out to find the fugitives and kill them all if necessary.

 To escape from the Kimera vessel, Liam, Lili and the Jaridian must make their
 way through a gauntlet of lethal laser beams. Using his superior eyesight, the
 Jaridian negotiates the course, only to find a dead end. As the walls start
 moving together to crush the trio and force them into the laser beams, they
 work together to climb over the walls to safety. When they paused to staunch
 the Jaridian's wounds, he revealed that the Jaridians and the Taelons used to
 be one race, until the Taelons separated, giving up the shaqarava and the dark
 side of its power in their quest for spiritual perfection. But the psychic
 "Commonality" they created destroyed their ability to reproduce. Now the
 Taelons wanted to force a union with the Jaridians by using humans as foot
 soldiers against them in the total war.

 Astounded by the Jaridian's revelation, Lili and Liam continued to make their
 way deeper into the ship. Liam dropped down a black well that lead to a
 doorway. When he pulled the door open the doorway exploded, smashing him into
 the ground. When Lili and the Jaridian reached Liam, he showed no vital
 signs. Lili frantically tried to revive him, but it took the Jaridian's
 shaqarava to bring Liam back to life. They entered the inner chamber where
 they found a hologram of a Kimera woman. She informed them she could not
 reveal the ship's secrets, which enraged the Jaridian. When he threatened
 her, she struck him down with a blast of power. When it seemed she may turn
 on Liam and Lili, Liam reasoned with the hologram and convinced her that the
 ship's programming must be corrupted since the Kimera never hurt other
 species. The hologram image followed the only recourse it could and began a
 self-destruct sequence to destroy the ship.

 Liam and Lili collected the injured Jaridian and raced back through the
 Kimera ship to their shuttles. Liam put the Jaridian on board one shuttle and
 sabotaged the interdimensional drive unit, giving the Jaridian enough power
 to fly home before the unit incinerated, destroying its secrets. The Jaridian
 was grateful to Liam for saving his life but vowed to return to Earth to
 confront the Taelons. Lili and Liam boarded their shuttle and returned to
 Earth, where Da'an's attempt to oust Zo'or had failed, ensuring the
 Jaridians, Taelons and humans would met again.

 @{b}Second Chances [#35]@{ub} (1999)

 Zo'or enlisted a private human business consortium to develop an enterprise
 known as Second Chances, a modern day "fountain of youth." Using a Taelon
 procedure, old and ailing candidates entered a chamber which transformed
 them into vibrant, healthy people 30 years younger. Major Liam Kincaid was
 immediately suspicious, but the entrepreneurial Augur warned him there
 would be a huge demand for the procedure if it was deemed safe. The
 Resistance members were unaware there had already been secret trials, and
 that at least one unsuccessful candidate had been killed after begging for
 the operation to be reversed.

 Liam approached Captain Lili Marquette to help investigate, but found her
 distant and distracted. She shipped off to met with Resistance members in the
 Pacific Northwest, led by a female firebrand named Hayley Simmons. Hayley and
 her fighters told Lili that Jonathan Doors could no longer lead the Resistance
 effectively since he had announced his presidential candidacy, and they asked
 Lili to step forward to take his place. Meanwhile, the Taelons were preparing
 for the first live, televised Second Chances procedure. Behind the scenes,
 Da'an demanded that Zo'or give the Synod a full accounting of this clandestine
 commercial partnership. But Zo'or pushed ahead, choosing as his subject an
 aged and infirm lady named Pearl Bell, who was particalised in a special
 chamber then emerged as a gorgeous young woman.

 As expected, people clamoured for the procedure. Doors appeared on television
 to warn people they were selling their souls by lining up for Second Chances,
 but his words were soon forgotten when the now beautiful Pearl also went on
 television to thank the Taelons for her new lease on life. Pearl also revealed
 that the Taelons performed a successful heart operation on her son, a story
 Liam knew to be false. The Resistance began to suspect that Zo'or was using
 the age-reversing procedure to implant false memories in people, insinuating
 loving and referential bonds with the Taelons, which never really existed.

 Resistance members confronted Doors and asked him to step down as leader,
 and Liam told Da'an he must move forcefully against Second Chances. Da'an
 informed Liam that it was too late, as Pearl had been asked to introduce a
 large group of subjects who had just completed the procedure. Hayley and her
 troops crashed the reception, where a Resistance leader named Randy began to
 bait the group. His taunts caused one man to snap. The man stole a gun from
 a security guard and began firing into the crowd. In the ensuing melee, the
 Resistance members kidnapped Pearl, spiriting her off to one of their
 doctors for examination.

 Dr. Hart confirmed their suspicions that the Taelons had implanted false
 memories into Pearl's brain. Liam realized he must break into the Second
 Chances headquarters to find evidence of Zo'or's hidden agenda. Meanwhile,
 Agent Ron Sandoval started a spin campaign to convince the public that the
 disastrous event was engineered by the Resistance. Hayley accompanied Liam,
 while Lili entered the Second Chances facility as a Taelon agent and shut down
 the security grid to give them access. Liam and Hayley discovered personal
 files on all the Second Chances subjects, proving that Zo'or had their
 backgrounds checked so that he was able to implant plausible memories. Liam
 and Hayley grabbed the files as evidence and barely managed to escape the
 building after a security alert.

 The Resistance made the Second Chances files public and the FDA shut down the
 enterprise. However, news reports revealed that some people still wanted to
 undergo the procedure, despite the threat to their personal freedom. In the
 face of such dangerous human naivete, it was Liam, not Lili, who stepped
 forward to lead the Resistance, telling Da'an he'll fight the Taelons and
 their secret agenda in any way he knows how.

 @{b}Payback [#36]@{ub} (1999)

 The Taelons had invited the press and public to the opening of a new portal
 station. Da'an and Zo'or were both present and listening to a speech being
 given by Dr. Jeffrey Whitfield, the human Director of Portal Research. Major
 Liam Kincaid and Captain Lili Marquette were also on hand for security. In the
 crowd, a nondescript man, Arnold Creighton moved toward the stage. Suddenly, a
 strange flash of energy radiated from Dr. Whitfield's body and he collapsed in
 incredible pain. By the time Lili reached him he was already dead and
 Creighton had disappeared.

 Liam met with Zo'or and Agent Ron Sandoval to discuss Whitfield's death. Zo'or
 refused to shut down the portals, sparking Liam's suspicions that the
 transportation devices were somehow connected to Whitfield's mysterious death.
 But Dr. Hart, who performed Whitfield's autopsy, told Liam and Sandoval that
 Whitfield died from a massive dose of cyanide, which somehow exploded from a
 capsule in the middle of his chest cavity. Without injection marks or the
 possibility that he swallowed the capsule himself, Dr. Hart was at a loss to
 explain Whitfield's strange demise.

 The Taelons called a press conference to reassure the public that the portal
 systems were safe. As Sa'al, the Taelon engineer in charge of the new portal,
 stepped up to the podium, he was confronted by Jonathan Doors, who used the
 opportunity to further his anti-Taelon presidential platform. Doors and Sa'al
 exchanged heated words and the Taelon suddenly clutched his stomach as light
 radiated from a hole in his skin. Liam and Lili rushed to his aid, but Sa'al
 exploded in a blinding flash, his plasma essence vanishing into the air.

 Confident that just one person was responsible for both attacks, Liam and
 Sandoval narrowed the field of suspects by viewing news footage and security
 scans of everyone present at both public events. They stopped at a picture of
 Arnold Creighton, a former MIT professor and outspoken critic of the Taelons.
 The group tracked Creighton to a radical, alternative university where he was
 now employed. Upon their arrival, Sandoval, Liam, Lili and their assault team
 were cornered by a group of hostile students and Sandoval shoved one
 protester to the ground.

 They proceeded to Creighton's lab, where their arrival activated a video
 monitor. Creighton appeared on screen and declared war on the Taelons.

 As his transmission ended, an object suddenly dropped out of thin air and Liam
 screamed for everyone to head for cover as a high-tech bomb destroyed the lab.

 Liam and Lili enlisted Augur to dig into Creighton's background. He discovered
 that Creighton was researching the quantum displacement of subatomic particles
 and may have created a miniature teleportation device, an invention beyond
 even Taelon knowledge. The device could instantaneously transport any object
 to any place, giving Creighton the power to kill someone from the inside out.

 When Doors went public with the students' secret footage of Sandoval
 assaulting them on university property, Zo'or suspended Sandoval from his
 duties, leaving him free to focus on the hunt for Creighton and his
 teleportation device. Meanwhile, Da'an called a meeting with human leaders to
 apologize for the university incident. Zo'or told Sandoval to leak
 information about the meeting, laying a trap for Creighton, in spite of the
 danger to Da'an. With Liam at his side, and unaware of the set up, Da'an
 entered sealed chambers to meet his human guests, with Augur monitoring them
 from his base as extra security.

 But Creighton had discovered the site of the meeting and sent in a spy camera
 to locate Da'an. Lili joined Augur on counter-surveillance, and they both help
 Liam track the miniature video camera. When Creighton pinpointed the meeting
 room, he dropped an explosive device in its midst. Liam got Da'an out with
 only seconds to spare. But Sandoval had also been tracking Creighton from the
 Taelon mother ship and found his transmission coordinates. He and Lili burst
 into Creighton's basement command centre. With teleporter in hand, Creighton
 pressed the activation key and vanishes in front of them. Augur and Liam
 traced Creighton's transmission signal to a warehouse and they entered the
 building to a gruesome sight. Creighton had teleported himself into a wire
 rack, and thin steel rods now pierced his body. In agony, Creighton told Liam
 and Augur he couldn't let the Taelons have his invention. He programmed the
 teleporter to transport into itself, creating a huge anti-matter explosion.
 The scientist and his device disappeared without a trace, leaving the Taelons
 and the Resistance in a race to discover the technology for themselves.

 @{b}Friendly Fire [#37]@{ub} (1999)

 Working in a secret laboratory, Resistance fighter Paul Chandler and scientist
 Terry Wu studied a stolen Taelon shuttle. Suddenly two men burst into the
 hideout, and in the ensuing gunfire Chandler's cohorts were killed and the lab
 was incinerated. At the last minute the shuttle took to the skies, but who was
 piloting the craft was unknown.

 Jonathan Doors informed Major Liam Kincaid and Captain Lili Marquette of the
 incident just as they were called to duty by Agent Ron Sandoval. Liam and Lili
 travelled to the lab site where they found evidence that the attack was an
 inside job, pointing to a traitor within the Resistance. Lili also found her
 friend Chandler's dog tags in the ashes, leaving her grief-stricken but
 relieved that Paul must had been a victim instead of a culprit. Mourning
 Paul's death at Augur's place, Lili and Liam were called to join Sandoval at a
 remote location where he'd tracked the stolen shuttle. As they burst into a
 work shed, the three were surprised to find only a radio broadcasting Thomas
 Paine's anti-Taelon radio show. In seconds they discovered they'd walked into
 a trap as the shuttle descended and fired on them, and they barely had time to
 escape with their lives.

 As Zo'or turned up the pressure to find the stolen shuttle, Liam and Lili
 confronted Thomas Paine at his rural radio station, but he denied any
 involvement with the stolen shuttle. Sandoval summoned the agents to a
 warehouse, where two suspects had taken cover. In the ensuing shoot-out one
 man died, but when Lili confronted the second man trying to escape, she was
 stunned to see it was Paul Chandler.

 When Lili let him escape, Chandler sensed an ally for his mission, and he
 sneaked into Lili's apartment to ask her to join him in taking up arms
 against the Taelons. Lili promised him nothing, but again let him escape
 into the night.

 Liam enlisted Augur's help in tracking the stolen shuttle, and Augur
 discovered the shuttle's engine had been damaged slightly and could cause a
 huge anti-matter explosion at any time. When Lili contacted Chandler to tell
 him about the dangerous engine fault, he again entreated her to join his
 cause. The pilots flew to a lakeside retreat, followed by Liam who tried to
 talk Chandler into giving himself up. But Chandler had the cottage rigged, and
 flew off in the shuttle as he detonated his sanctuary. Shaken by the renegade
 Resistance member's determination, Lili and Liam took Paul's VR helmet back to
 Augur, who decoded its memory. They're shocked to see Chandler was planning an
 attack on the Taelon embassy in Washington.

 Knowing Chandler's shuttle would create an explosion equal to a nuclear attack
 if it hit the embassy building, Lili raced to Washington to get Da'an out of
 harm's way. Liam and Augur boarded Liam's shuttle to intercept Chandler in
 interdimensional space before he could complete his mission. As a dog-fight
 ensued between Chandler and Liam, Da'an refused to leave his office, telling
 Lili he wouldn't succumb to terrorism. As the shuttle entered normal airspace,
 the embassy suddenly transformed itself into an armed fortress. Neither Lili
 nor Liam could stop Chandler on his deadly path and his shuttle exploded
 against the Taelon embassy which diverted the cataclysmic blast up to the
 heavens. Chandler was dead, and Lili wondered whether his call to arms should
 be heeded by the Resistance.

 @{b}Volunteers [#38]@{ub} (1999)

 A Resistance cell leader named Mitchell met with his fighters, including a
 brash new recruit named Julia, in an abandoned warehouse. Suddenly, the cell
 came under attack by a heavily armed group. The Resistance members escaped
 through a trap door, but were pursued by a "volunteer" squad of specially
 trained Taelon implanted teenagers lead by a young woman named Amanda. She
 cornered a wounded Mitchell in an alleyway, but Julia and another Resistance
 member, shadowing Mitchell, ambushed Amanda from behind.

 Captain Lili Marquette, Major Liam Kincaid and Augur were surprised when
 Julia and her cell showed up at Augur's lair with the unconscious Amanda in
 tow. They decided to take Amanda to Dr. Melissa Park to have the Taelon
 implant removed, hoping to turn their captive's allegiance, but Dr. Park
 discovered that Amanda's implant didn't function like a CVI, and that her
 association with the Taelons was of her free will. Dr. Park also warned the
 Resistance members that Amanda's implant was killing her, because of its
 hyper-stimulation of her nervous system. As they tried to decide their next
 step, Amanda woke up and grabbed Dr. Park, holding her hostage. Some
 fast-talking from Liam diffused the situation, and Amanda finally agreed to
 cooperate.

 On board the mothership, Zo'or ordered Agent Ron Sandoval to find Amanda
 before the missing volunteer revealed information about their secret
 operation. Liam and Lili tracked Amanda's mother to a seedy hotel, where the
 woman told them Amanda was a school dropout before she started hanging around
 at a Taelon Friendship centre and joined their youth program. The Resistance
 members sent Julia undercover, to join the Taelon Volunteer Program.

 Meanwhile, Liam tried to break down Amanda's defences, to find out more about
 the Volunteers. He confronted Da'an about the program, which the Taelon leader
 designed to help troubled kids. Da'an remained adamant that the Volunteers was
 a benign and benevolent program and was not the military conspiracy Liam was
 intimating. Liam realizes someone had tampered with the implants and the
 program to gain very different results and suspects Zo'or may be involved.

 At boot camp, the squad commander started indoctrinating the recruits in
 Taelon loyalty and prepared them for a massive assault. Julia warned Liam
 and Lili, who mobilized the Resistance for a counter attack. Liam and Amanda
 infiltrated the Volunteer base, monitoring Volunteers as they were sent
 through an elaborate portal transportation system. They discovered the
 recruits were being sent after an unknown enemy in another galaxy. On board
 the mothership, Da'an asked Sandoval why his security access to the
 Volunteer Program had been revoked. Meanwhile, the squad commander saw Liam
 and Amanda on the base and raised the alert. Liam and Amanda hid in a room
 filled with corpses of young volunteers, all casualties of war. They
 continued to the portal control room, desperately trying to sabotage the
 system. As troops closed in on them, they realized they had to destroy the
 portal from inside, risking their lives.

 As Liam rushed to hold off a guard, Amanda leaped into the portal and yanked
 out its power conduit, trapping her in interdimensional space. Meanwhile,
 Julia had abandoned her volunteer unit and met up with Liam to escape
 through a portal together. After a heated confrontation with Zo'or, Da'an
 shut down the Volunteer program immediately, ending the Taelons' brutal
 exploitation of humanity.

 @{b}Bliss [#39]@{ub} (1999)

 While she was relaxing at the Flat Planet Cafe, Captain Lili Marquette was
 approached by a man named Rick, who slipped an alien-looking orb into her
 hand. Lili was immediately overtaken by a powerful drug rush, which left her
 weakened and hallucinating. Augur rushed Lili to the hospital, where she was
 diagnosed as another victim of "bliss," a highly addictive and destructive
 street drug of unknown origin. Major Liam Kincaid arrived and discussed Lili's
 condition with the doctor, but unknown to the doctor, Lili had left the
 hospital for Augur's.

 When Liam and Agent Ron Sandoval spoke to Zo'or and Da'an about the bliss
 epidemic, they denied any knowledge of the drug, even though the bliss orbs
 were Taelon in design. Liam and Lili confronted Rick at an old warehouse,
 where they forced the dealer to reveal his drug connections. Rick revealed
 the bliss was coming through the Taelon portal system from a main supply in
 Dublin, Ireland. Liam and Lili turned the dealer over to the cops, then
 proceeded to Augur's with Rick's case of bliss orbs. As Augur studied the
 orbs, it becomes obvious Lili was in acute withdrawal and couldn't be near
 the drug. Augur took Lili back to the hospital where they were shocked to
 see the emergency ward was overflowing with bliss addicts in terrible shape.
 Despite the doctor's warning that she may die without medical supervision,
 Lili begged Augur to take her back to his place to help her come down off
 the drug on her own.

 Liam and Sandoval headed to Ireland to investigate whether the drug's point of
 origin had anything to do with Ma'el's tomb, which contained many ancient
 Taelon artifacts. They're met by Dr. Catherine Cox, the chief archeologist.
 Dr. Cox told the agents there had been an increase in the local population of
 "Taelonists," purist followers of the Taelons and their alien technology and
 culture. She took them to the Taelonists' primitive encampment, where they met
 Remi, the unofficial leader of the group. Liam and Sandoval learned that the
 Taelonists possessed two tablets inscribed with Ma'el's writings, but the
 group denied any knowledge of bliss or its origins. Because he could read the
 tablets, Liam realized they were a new archeological find, which had been kept
 secret from the public.

 He enlists Dr. Cox to take them on a tour of the tomb's perimeter, where they
 find a cave marked with Taelon script. The cave was set up like a Taelon
 laboratory, complete with data terminals. Suddenly a holographic image of
 Ma'el appeared, and informed them that two thousand years ago the human
 population became addicted to a rare plant. Ma'el developed a counter-active
 agent and saved humanity, destroying all but a single sample of the plant.

 Liam and Sandoval returned to the mothership to tell Zo'or and Da'an they
 suspected the Taelonists had found Ma'el's lab and were engineering the bliss
 epidemic. The Taelon leaders urged them to find the bliss antidote as soon as
 possible, as the fate of humanity hung in the balance. Liam and Sandoval
 returned to Ireland to discover the Taelonists had discovered a cache of orbs.
 While en route to the site with Dr. Cox, they were ambushed by gunfire. After
 they killed one of the snipers, they realized he's not one of the Taelonists.
 When Liam confronted Remi he declared his group was innocent of any violence
 and they had never held any weapons.

 Meanwhile, Augur nursed a delirious Lili through her bliss withdrawal, worried
 as she slid in and out of consciousness. In her lucid moments they relived
 their friendship, and Lili remembered other events of her life. As Lili's life
 hung by a thread, Liam and Sandoval confronted Dr. Cox, who they realized
 could be the only person capable of exploiting Ma'el's tomb for her own gain.
 Found out, she trapped Liam and Sandoval in a Taelon prison made of shimmering
 energy walls. She admitted she started the bliss epidemic by giving the drug
 away free, part of her plan to find fame and fortune as the discoverer of the
 antidote. As she escaped with the serum, she blasted the cave entrance to seal
 Liam and Sandoval inside, their oxygen quickly running out.

 Suddenly, Remi appeared in the lab through a secret wall panel and deactivated
 the energy prison. Liam and Sandoval raced after Catherine Cox, driving her
 jeep off the road and grabbing the antidote. Liam flew his shuttle directly
 back to Augur's, where Lili lay apparently lifeless. He injected the antidote
 and Lili responded, her recovery the first in the end of the bliss epidemic.

 @{b}Highjacked [#40]@{ub} (1999)

 The Taelons hired a political spin doctor to boost their image during the U.S.
 Presidential campaign. Paul Wagner advised them to enlist the help of a
 popular television talk show host by giving her an exclusive tour of the
 Taelon mothership. When Abby Franklin arrived on board the Taelons and their
 protectors realized she's no pushover, as she started drilling Captain Lili
 Marquette and Agent Ron Sandoval with probing questions about their
 relationships and duties with the aliens. During this time Major Liam Kincaid
 went into an isolated computer station on the mothership and entered a
 sequence of codes. Almost immediately the mothership careened into
 interdimensional space, its navigation systems locked into maximum velocity.

 As the ship was being highjacked to some unknown destination, Abby captured
 the entire emergency with her video camera. Realizing some enemy must be
 trying to steal the mothership and all its technology, Da'an convinced Zo'or
 to eject the engine core, which would strand the mothership in
 interdimensional space. The manoeuvre stopped the mothership, but damaged the
 craft's vital systems. As the crew ran their diagnostic assessments,
 Sandoval, having caught Liam on security video tampering with the
 navigational computer, located and arrested him.

 Liam was stunned by the accusation and the video evidence, and swore he didn't
 touch the computer. As Liam was taken to a holding cell Zo'or told Da'an he
 would remove him as the North American Companion for his Protector's
 treacherous actions. Lili told the Taelon leaders their predicament was worse
 than they feared, as the ship was trapped in a dead pocket of space; which was
 leeching all the remaining energy on board. Da'an confronted Liam in his cell
 and Liam begged to be released so he could find the imposter who had
 imperilled the ship. While Da'an refused to let him go, Lili was convinced of
 Liam's innocence and let him escape.

 As Liam sneaked down a corridor he discovered Abby talking to an exact
 double of himself. Liam lunged at the imposter after he knocked Abby
 unconscious, but during the struggle the intruder morphed into the Taelon's
 spin doctor, Paul Wagner.

 Abby woke up and levelled a gun at the two men. Suddenly, Wagner morphed
 into a Jaridian replicant, knocking out both Liam and Abby with a powerful
 energy pulse. When they came to, Liam and Abby returned to the bridge where
 they convinced the others that there was a Replicant on board, which came
 disguised as Wagner.

 In fact, Abby had her video camera rolling and caught the entire sequence
 of events. They realized the Jaridians were highjacking the ship to their
 homeworld and keeping the crew alive to tell them how to harness Taelon
 technology.

 Liam and Lili struggled to repair the ship's engine, which would also
 reactivate the security system's capabilities to flush out the Replicant.
 Sandoval arrived while they were working in the computer core, but Liam
 quickly noticed Sandoval's Skrill was missing which could mean only one thing
 - he was face to face with the Replicant again. As Liam drew his weapon the
 real Sandoval arrived and a shoot-out ensued. Liam used his shaqarava to
 protect Abby and frightened off the Replicant ,which realized his opponent had
 alien fire power. Unfortunately, Abby had also seen Liam's strange powers,
 and, as a reporter, was determined to find out more.

 But time was running out for everyone on board, as Zo'or ordered the
 destruction of the mothership to keep it from Jaridian hands. In a last-ditch
 effort, Lili and Liam headed off in their shuttles to punch a hole in the
 space pocket to release the craft. But the Replicant was still interfering
 with power to the mothership and the shuttles, so in a daring decision, Liam
 fired on the mothership, ripping a hole in the hull which sucked the Replicant
 into space. As the mothership repaired itself, Lili managed to create an
 opening in the space pocket, and the three crafts slipped through into
 conventional space.

 As Abby flew back to Earth, she viewed her footage of Liam and knew she owed
 him a hero's debt. She erased the evidence of his special powers, ensuring his
 future with the Taelons and the Resistance. Liam delivered new computer codes
 he took from the mothership to Augur who ran them through his system to
 uncover some unsettling results: in a map of the expanding Jaridian and Taelon
 Empires, the Jaridians were clearly in the lead.

 @{b}Defector [#41]@{ub} (1999)

 Captain Lili Marquette and Agent Ron Sandoval were on duty aboard the Taelon
 mothership when they were alerted to two unidentified shuttles which suddenly
 appeared in Earth airspace. One shuttle was clearly chasing the other, but
 before contact could be made, the pursuing shuttle crashed into a mountain and
 the target shuttle disappeared from the air traffic control screen. Unobserved
 by the mothership, the Taelon pilot managed to land his craft and emerged from
 the shuttle in his natural "blue" form.

 Meanwhile, Major Liam Kincaid informed Augur that Da'an had left the Taelon
 mothership without telling him where he was going. Suddenly, Lili called them
 at Augur's to ask for help in tracking the renegade shuttle, which was not
 from the Taelons' Earth fleet. On board the mothership Zo'or was cryptic about
 the missing pilot, commanding Sandoval and Lili to apprehend him dead or
 alive. Lili and Sandoval realized the fugitive was an obvious threat, if Zo'or
 was willing to kill another Taelon.

 During this time, Da'an was on a spiritual retreat in a virtual Taelon
 homeworld, immersed in a primitive sacred ritual. Back on Earth, the fugitive
 Taelon revealed himself to two boys whom he encountered playing in the woods.
 The kids were frightened at first, until the Taelon touched one of them and
 was able to cloak himself with a human exterior. He told the boys his name was
 Bel'lie and that he needed a place to hide. They took him to their clubhouse
 and swore to keep his location a secret. After communicating with Lili on the
 mothership, the Resistance knew they only had a thin margin to find the Taelon
 before Zo'or does, and they sent out extra troops to the shuttle crash site.
 When the Resistance fighters flushed the boys out of the bushes near their
 secret hideout, Liam worked quickly to win their trust to take him to Bel'lie.

 Zo'or had also been manoeuvring to get to the bottom of the Taelon
 defection, and went to Da'an's place of retreat to tell him about the
 shuttle crash. When Zo'or told Da'an the fugitive was Bel'lie, Da'an was
 deeply unsettled. Liam discovered why, when he confronted Bel'lie in the
 clubhouse and the defector told him he had come to help humans fight their
 Taelon oppressors. In the midst of their dialogue shuttles from the
 mothership attacked the area, forcing the Resistance to flee with Bel'lie.
 Liam had to decide whether to turn Bel'lie over to the Taelon forces, but
 decided to shelter him at Augur's instead.

 Liam proceeded to the mothership, where he demanded that Zo'or tell him where
 he could find Da'an. Zo'or refused to let Liam interrupt Da'an's sacred
 pilgrimage, and re-issues his order that they find the defector at once. Liam
 returned to Augur, where he grilled Bel'lie about his mission. Bel'lie told
 the Resistance members that the Taelons were subjugating hundreds of planets
 in their war with the Jaridians. He told them he had come to Earth to take
 back human fighters to join forces with other renegade Taelons, and that his
 shuttle databanks contained proof of a Taelon underground. To further prove
 his integrity, Bel'lie agreed to sever his link with the Taelon Commonality
 despite the risk that he would regress into an Atavus, a primitive alien life
 form, which Taelon and humans alike would seek to destroy.

 In the mothership shuttle bay, Lili barely had time to download Bel'lie's
 databanks from the recovered shuttle before Sandoval ordered the airship
 torn apart. She transmitted the information to Augur's, where Bel'lie
 talked to Liam about his crusade. When Liam tried to persuade Bel'lie to
 confide in Da'an, the Taelon shocked him by announcing Da'an was the
 architect of the Taelon strategy of galactic destruction, and that Da'an
 himself had banished Bel'lie to the farthest reaches of the galaxy for
 opposing his will. Confused by Da'an's disappearance on his supposed
 retreat, Liam didn't know what to believe.

 As Liam and Lili tried to find where Da'an had gone, the operation the
 Resistance had used to separate Bel'lie from the Commonality suddenly went
 wrong. Before anyone could stop it, Bel'lie regressed into an Atavus, and
 defended himself with shaqarava blasts as he escaped from Augur's hideout.
 Liam suspected Bel'lie may have aided his transformation so he could find
 Da'an and kill him, no longer prevented from doing so by his Taelon
 consciousness . He followed the Atavus to Da'an's office, then through the
 portal which lead to Da'an's virtual retreat. Liam arrived on Da'an's
 virtual mountain top just as Bel'lie the Atavus attacked Da'an. Liam stepped
 in to defend the Taelon leader and, after grappling with the Atavus, sent
 him hurtling off a cliff. Liam turned to Da'an to confront him with
 Bel'lie's accusations, but Da'an could only say he was no longer the Taelon
 he once was. With the proof of Bel'lie's databanks, Liam and the Resistance
 were left wondering if Da'an was truly sympathetic to their cause, or was
 just using it as a ruse, or whether Zo'or had set up Da'an to be killed by
 Bel'lie in his own deadly game.

 @{b}Heroes & Heartbreak [#42]@{ub} (1999)

 A heavily disguised Augur met an old MIT roommate named Harry Bookman who had
 hired Augur to work out complicated mathematical equations. Harry admitted he
 had been using Augurs formulae on a huge project for the Taelons, which would
 alter interdimensional space fields. Augur was furious at Harry's complicity
 with the Taelons and started to leave when Harry suddenly started to shimmer
 and dissolve before him. As he pleaded with Augur to save him, Harry explained
 that he accidentally absorbed a shard of ID space during an experiment. A huge
 energy ripple sucked Harry into a time/space rift, his global communicator
 dropped to the ground as he disappeared. Augur was then summoned to meet the
 mysterious person behind the Taelon project.

 Augur hurried to his house to try to contact Captains Captain Lili Marquette
 and Major Liam Kincaid, who were incommunicado in a meeting on the mothership.
 Leaving his coordinates with his Lili holograph, Augur headed off to his
 rendezvous in a seedy Washington neighbourhood. A white stretch limousine
 pulled up and a beautiful woman named Beverly Wu invited Augur inside. The
 mysterious woman informed Augur she wanted to hire him for her high-tech
 weapons company, and whisked him off through her private portal to inspect a
 test site. Meanwhile, Liam arrived at Augur's with his fellow Resistance
 member Julia, and learned that Augur had disappeared with an unknown woman. In
 fact, Beverly had transported Augur all the way to Antarctica, to reveal the
 Taelons' secret weapons project: a huge underground cannon capable of
 launching an immense ball of magma from the centre of the Earth into ID space.

 On board the mothership, Zo'or went to Da'an to tell him the Taelons' last
 engagement with the Jaridians had ended badly and their forces were in full
 retreat. Zo'or announced that he wanted to activate the Forge Project, Beverly
 Wu's Antarctic weapons installation, to strike at the Jaridians while they
 regroup. Da'an was against using Earth as a base of attack against the
 Jaridians, but Zo'or ignored his objections and took control of the project.
 Liam and Lili tracked down Jonathan Doors on the presidential campaign trail
 to ask for his help in finding Augur. Doors identified Beverly Wu from video
 surveillance tapes, and warned them that Augur was in big trouble if he was
 involved with the Forge Project. But Augur was already working alongside
 Beverly to breach ID Space, and after the exhilaration of a big breakthrough,
 ended up in bed with her.

 Still trying to find Augur, Liam told Da'an a friend may be involved in the
 Forge Project, but Da'an remained wilfully obtuse, and would reveal nothing.

 At the South Pole, Beverly decided to try a full power test, despite Augur's
 reservations. When the cannon fired its load of magma it created a huge tear
 in ID space, which exploded into the research station, killing a technician.
 Augur was growing more concerned about the project, but Beverly convinced him
 to stay on and perfect her weapons trials. Liam finally traced Augur to the
 facility, and arrived via portal. Agent Ron Sandoval was also at the site,
 doing a security sweep. Liam sneaked into a lab where he finally found Augur.
 Augur gave Liam the background on the Forge Project's scientific risks, and
 the likelihood of a lethal Jaridian response. He also revealed that Da'an had
 been in charge of the weapon's initial development. Liam escaped back to the
 mothership, now positioned above Antarctica, where he confronted Da'an, and
 tried to warn him about the dangers of the Forge Project. But Da'an only threw
 Liam's Resistance activities back in his face, and refused to intercede.

 Taking matters into their own hands, the Resistance prepared a strike team
 lead by Julia to infiltrate the weapons facility. But Beverly had already
 given the order to fire the magma cannon at the Jaridian forces repeatedly,
 which ripped apart interdimensional space, creating a wormhole leading
 straight to the Jaridians. As the Resistance troops took over the control
 bridge, Augur struggled to mend the space rift, which sent a shock wave
 exploding onto the bridge. The blast destroyed equipment and wrought havoc,
 killing multiple crewmembers. Augur rushed to help Beverly, who had been
 crushed under a metal girder. As she died in his arms he confessed his love
 for her, but she was full of hate, cursing him for destroying her work.

 Above the facility, the mothership prepared to flee into space because a
 Jaridian warship had entered the wormhole and was approaching Earth. In a
 last-ditch effort, Da'an and Liam boarded their shuttle and flew up to head
 off the Jaridians, firing on their menacing cruiser. After taking a hit, Da'an
 and Liam jettison their fusion matrix, and tricked the Jaridians into blasting
 the engine, creating a massive energy explosion. The ID tunnel finally
 collapsed on itself and closed the wormhole, sealing off the Jaridians. Earth
 was out of immediate danger, until the Jaridians discover how to cross
 interdimensional space to answer the attack.

 @{b}Message In A Bottle [#43]@{ub} (1999)

 When a Jaridian probe entered Earth's atmosphere, Zo'or ordered Da'an to
 destroy it by shooting it down from the Taelon Embassy in Washington. U.S.
 President Thompson called Zo'or to express America's outrage that Earth was
 being used as an intergalactic battleground, and Zo'or sent Agent Ron Sandoval
 to find the probe and make sure it was out of commission. Captain Lili
 Marquette alerted Major Liam Kincaid, who gathered a team to capture the
 probe's Jaridian technology for the Resistance.

 Liam proceeded to the probe's co-ordinates with Augur and Julia. Augur used a
 special field dampener to secure the damaged probe, while Liam diverted
 Sandoval, who also had arrived at the site. A shoot-out between the Resistance
 and Sandoval's troops ensued, with Sandoval's shuttle being blown into a
 million pieces, allowing Julia and Augur to escape with the probe. They
 removed it to a warehouse and started to study it when hooded commandos burst
 into the building and overwhelmed the Resistance members. Liam, Julia and
 Augur were taken to a fortified bunker inside Mount Weather, where they met
 the military group's leader, the head of Operation Dark Knight. Not only does
 the Colonel Zeke have extensive background information on the Resistance
 members' identities, he shocked them by introducing himself as the "real" Liam
 Kincaid, the individual Augur based Liam's Resistance identity on.

 On the Taelon mothership Zo'or was furious at the loss of the probe, and
 expanded Sandoval's powers to give him license to kill to get it back and to
 destroy the Resistance. Sandoval leaned on Lili to find the probe and locate
 Liam, and to affirm her allegiance only to him. When Sandoval left, Da'an
 approached Lili ostensibly to ask whether she had found Liam. Lili realized
 Da'an wanted to speak privately to her. The Companion opened up to Lili and
 questioned his own leadership abilities in the face of Zo'or's growing
 ruthlessness. Lili does her best to reassure Da'an, despite his apparent
 complicity in many of the Taelons' evil plots.

 Inside the Mount Weather complex, Liam tried to defend himself to Augur and
 Julia, until he was taken aside by the Colonel. He asked Liam to explain his
 foggy past and his two-sided relationship with the Taelons, but Liam gave away
 nothing. The Colonel sensed Liam's integrity, and decided to trust him despite
 knowing his real identity. He took him further inside the complex to an
 advanced research lab. Augur was there working on the probe with a scientist
 named Bettis. When they tried to access the probe's memory, they activated its
 weapons systems. The probe started firing, but when Liam raises his shaqarava,
 the probe recognized his energy signature and retreated. However, Liam was
 exhausted by his efforts, and had to be brought around by the Colonel, who was
 suspicious of his strange powers.

 The Colonel decided to put all three Resistance members into a holding cell
 until he could find out more about their ties to the Taelons.

 Locked in the brig, Augur did some calculations, and realized his field
 dampener wouldn't hold and the Jaridian probe would become active once more.
 his predictions came true as the probe burst to life in the lab, forcing the
 Colonel, Bettis and their forces to seal off the area and flee to another
 level, collecting their Resistance prisoners en route. The probe transformed
 into a Jaridian replicant, which assumed the form of Augur. The replicant
 started to cut its way through the lab's titanium door, and the team realized
 they need help to contain it. Liam called Lili on board the mothership and
 asked her to transmit Jaridian command codes the Taelons had managed to
 decipher. With Sandoval watching her every move, Lili took a chance and asked
 Da'an to help her access the Mothership's mainframe, which he reservedly does.
 As Lili hurried to access her data, Sandoval discovers the probe's
 co-ordinates, and informed Zo'or about its location in the high security
 military facility in Mount Weather. Zo'or grilled President Thompson about the
 military's involvement with the probe. When Thompson denied any knowledge,
 Zo'or demanded full access for Sandoval and his storm troopers.

 Inside the installation the replicant was getting closer, as its human
 targets moved higher into the facility. Lili was finally able to download the
 command codes, arming the Resistance members and the commando troops just as
 the replicant broke through their last line of defence. Liam loaded his
 global with the codes and met the replicant face to face. When it looked like
 the replicant would fire on Liam, instead it began to speak, saying that it
 carried a message from the Jaridian Empire. The replicant asked humanity to
 join the Jaridians in their fight against the Taelons, and told Liam it could
 help build an advanced communications device to speak with the Jaridian
 leaders. But before the replicant could transmit all its instructions,
 Sandoval's storm troopers breached the building, forcing the Colonel's squad
 to put the building on self-destruct. The Resistance members and military
 team barely managed to get out of the building, but Sandoval's Volunteers
 perished in the nuclear explosion.

 Emerging in hand cuffs and claiming he had been able to escape his
 kidnappers, Liam was able to appear an innocent victim to Sandoval. When he
 said goodbye to the real Liam Kincaid in the Flat Planet Cafe, Liam learned
 the Colonel's secret military operation far exceeds Resistance resources,
 leaving him secure in the knowledge that the Taelons were facing an even
 greater fight from humanity than they thought.

 @{b}Crossfire [#44]@{ub} (1999)

 Jonathan Doors and his Presidential Campaign manager and son Joshua held a
 press conference under the watchful eye of Major Liam Kincaid and Secret
 Service Agent Hannigan. Liam noticed a strange tall man who was pretending to
 video record Doors' speech while he cased the room. When Liam confronted him
 the man bolted from the building and ran to the Flat Planet Cafe. Augur and
 his patrons hit the floor as Liam and the man exchanged gunfire, which ended
 when the man turned his Taelon weapon on himself and was completely vaporized.

 Liam took the man's videotape to Augur's where they examined it with Captain
 Lili Marquette and Julia. They realize the man was stalking Doors for some
 time, and when they reviewed the security footage from the Flat Planet Cafe,
 they discovered the man had a Taelon warrior implant. The Resistance members
 wanted to expose Zo'or with the video evidence, but Liam cautioned his team to
 lay low until after the Presidential elections.

 On board the Taelon mothership, Da'an informed Zo'or that the Taelon Synod
 would meet to assess his leadership. Liam went to Doors in his campaign
 headquarters to warn him that the Resistance suspected Zo'or was plotting
 against him. While Doors took the threat lightly, his son Joshua was concerned
 and told Liam he would increase his father's security. Liam proceeded to the
 mothership where Agent Ron Sandoval warned him to maintain his allegiance to
 the Taelons, whoever becomes President. Liam did some legwork on board the
 ship, then returned to Augur's to tell his Resistance members a secret shuttle
 was sent down to Earth at the time the warrior implant was snooping around
 Door's campaign. Julia told Liam she had uncovered a link between the implant
 and an underground arms dealer named Margolis, and Liam sent Augur with her to
 find out who was buying Taelon weapons.

 When Julia and Augur questioned Margolis, he confirmed he made a deal with a
 warrior implant, and offered to trade the weapons specs for tactical
 information from the Resistance. Suddenly one of the bio-engineered warriors
 burst into the hideout, and vaporized Margolis with a blast from a Taelon
 weapon. Julia and Augur fled the building, but the warrior caught up to them
 in an alleyway and attacked them. They tried to fend him off but the implant
 was impervious to grenades and even fire, and they were only able to escape
 him by racing off in their car.

 Once safe at Augur's place, they examined Margolis' specs on a computer
 disk and discovered the implant warriors were arming themselves with
 weapons undetectable by security scans, such as those used at appearances
 by the presidential candidates. Liam suspected the Resistance was being set
 up by a plot against Doors and was reluctant to put their members in danger
 at the next public debate. Julia was incensed by Liam's hesitance, and left
 to find Joshua behind Liam's back to offer her unit's protection at the
 upcoming candidate's debate.

 On the day of the debate, Lili, Liam and Sandoval accompanied Zo'or and Da'an
 to the convention centre, where Julia had also arrived with her team. Thompson
 and Doors took to the stage and embarked on a heated debate about the Taelon
 occupation and Resistance movement. Liam saw Julia, and confronted her,
 furious to find her armed. But it was impossible to remove her unit without
 attracting attention, so he left to scope out the building. At the back of the
 convention centre, Liam encountered a group of three men working on what
 appeared to be a video camera. When Liam demanded the men identify themselves,
 he realized they were bio-warriors and started a vicious fight with them. As
 Liam struggled, one of the men ran from the room. It was only after he
 disables his opponents' implants that Liam could pursue the potential
 assassin. But when Julia and her team responded to his alert, she discovers
 they had indeed been set up, and they were arrested by the secret service.
 During this commotion, a real assassin, took aim from a catwalk above the
 stage, and hit President Thompson directly in the chest. Sandoval aimed his
 Skrill in response, and obliterated the assassin.

 The Resistance reconnoitred at Augur's, and monitored reports of Thompson's
 recovery and huge lead in the polls. They heard false information about
 Resistance links to the assassination attempt, and that Julia and her team
 were being held on conspiracy to commit murder. But there was even more grim
 news to come: Joshua Doors appeared on television to announce that his father
 was behind the conspiracy to assassinate Thompson and that the secret service
 had issued a warrant for Doors' arrest.

 Liam headed out to find Doors, while on board the Taelon mothership, Zo'or and
 Da'an faced off once more, but this time Zo'or clearly held the upper hand. He
 threatened Da'an directly, and announced that the time had come to redefine
 the Taelons' relationship with humans. Lili tipped off the Resistance that
 hundreds of Volunteers were flying down to Earth, and warned as many cells to
 go into hiding as possible. In the midst of the panic, the election results
 came in and Thompson had been re-elected President, playing right into Taelon
 hands. Before he went back into hiding, Doors confronted Joshua, and
 discovered Joshua willingly set him up.

 As Doors fled his campaign headquarters, he ran into Liam, who spirited him
 away from danger. The next day Thompson gave a press conference where he
 declared a national emergency and imposed martial law throughout the United
 States until the Resistance was crushed.

 Taelon battle cruisers filled the sky, and civilian round-ups ensued, but Lili
 heard even worse news from Sandoval: Zo'or was arresting Da'an for conspiracy
 and treason. Lili contacted Liam, who had gone into hiding with Doors and
 Augur, and told him she wanted to overload the power supply to the mothership,
 which would kill all the Taelons, and everyone else, on board. While Liam and
 Doors argued over her suggestion, Lili lost contact with them when Volunteers
 stormed their safe house. Lili faced her decision alone, her finger moving to
 push the override button that would seal all their fates.

 @{b}Crackdown [#45]@{ub} (1999)

 Volunteers storm a hideout and whisk Jonathan Doors away. Liam Kincaid
 holds his own until Volunteer Renee Palmer jabs a weapon into his neck. As
 another Volunteer places Liam under arrest for conspiracy, Renee kills the
 Volunteer, rips off her fake implant and rescues Liam and Augur. As the
 trio dashes through the courtyard, Liam and Augur suddenly realize that
 Renee has vanished.

 Meanwhile on the Mothership, Lili, fearing the others are dead, overloads the
 engines to destroy the ship. Lili is arrested as a traitor as Zo'or performs a
 series of Taelon override commands to regenerate the Mothership.

 Back at Augur's lair, Liam and Augur watch reports about the arrests of
 suspected Resistance members and the collapse of the Underground's entire
 network of cells. Fearing the woman who saved them is a double agent, Augur
 sets out to identify Renee. When a newscast announces the death of Lili
 Marquette in the Mothership explosion, Liam storms into the Taelon Embassy and
 confronts Da'an with accusations that Zo'or is planning to take total
 political control. Da'an dismisses these charges and Liam resolves to prove
 the attempted assassination was not executed by the Resistance. Liam arrives
 on the Mothership and demands to take Lili's body back to Earth for a proper
 burial, but Agent Sandoval rejects his request. Liam says his last goodbye
 before Erika Vosser ejects Lili's body into the unnerving silence of space.

 Liam, determined to find the identity of the assassin, returns to the crime
 scene, slips one of the DNA samples into his pocket and leaves Medical
 Examiner Dale Anders to continue his work under the watchful eye of Tate.
 After Augur identifies Resistance member Albert Phillips from the DNA, Liam
 leaves to search for him and finds that Phillips was taken by the Taelons
 more than a month earlier.

 Meanwhile, as Doors paces in his cell on the Mothership, Vosser arrives with
 Zo'or, who proposes that the time has come to set aside their differences and
 establish a mutually beneficial alliance.

 On Earth, Sandoval, ensuring that nothing interferes with his personal
 agenda, directs Tate to guarantee that Medical Examiner Anders will not
 interfere. Liam goes to see Anders at his office, but finds him dead as
 Tate makes his escape. Liam sees that Anders' files have been pilfered and
 the "Thompson File" is missing.

 Meanwhile, President Thompson rides the crest of popularity, but Chief of
 Staff Hubble Urick expresses his concerns about the state of emergency and
 Zo'or's political demands.

 Later, Augur finds that Albert Phillips' DNA sample is over a month old.
 Liam leaves to retrieve a new sample from the catwalk in the auditorium
 where the attempted assassination took place. When Liam arrives, Tate,
 unbeknownst to Liam, is installing a time bomb. Liam collects more samples
 just before the bomb explodes and then lunges for safety. After testing the
 new DNA samples, Augur discovers the killer is Judson Corr, who murdered the
 wife of the late William Boone.

 Liam gives Urick the disk of evidence, telling him and the President that
 false accusations have been made in the assassination attempt. President
 Thompson rescinds the State of Emergency and orders all suspected Resistance
 prisoners being held on the Mothership be returned to Earth. When Liam spots
 Doors in the Shuttle Bay of the Mothership, he proposes they set aside their
 differences and work together against the Taelons. But Liam is shocked when
 Doors offers his hand in the Taelon gesture of mutual respect to Zo'or,
 confirming a newly formed association. Sandoval then assigns Liam to search
 for a woman masquerading as a Volunteer.

 Before Liam can respond, he sees a TV crew recording an announcement about
 the new alliance between Doors International and the Taelons, supervised by
 Renee Palmer. While Augur repairs his computer equipment, shut down by a
 virus during his search to identify Renee, he retires Holo-Lili to lay Lili
 Marquette to rest.

 But, at the end of a long, dark Taelon corridor in solitary confinement, Lili
 Marquette awaits her fate.

 @{b}The Vanished [#46]@{ub} (1999)

 As the Jantzen family settles in for the night, Volunteers break into their
 home and arrest Lawrence Jantzen, as his wife Claire and son Ty watch in
 horror. Later, at the Taelon Embassy, Claire and Ty present their case to
 Da'an, and Liam Kincaid pledges to Ty that he will locate his father.
 Enlisting Augur's help, Liam discovers similar cases all over the world.

 Meanwhile, on the Mothership, Erika Vosser leads Lili Marquette from her
 solitary confinement cell and tells her that Zo'or imposed the death sentence
 upon her for treason and then staged a mock funeral. Unnoticed, they depart
 the Mothership in a shuttle and make their way to Sandoval's secret facility.

 Meanwhile, Renee Palmer tries to convince Da'an to lend her a few of the
 detained Resistance sympathizers to be used as test subjects. Disguised as a
 brunette, she then goes to Sandoval's apartment to search for information.

 At Sandoval's secret facility, Vosser and Tate begin an implant procedure on
 Lili. Later, when Vosser checks Lili's vital signs, Lili punches Vosser in the
 face and tries to make an escape. She discovers a makeshift prison of
 Resistance sympathizers, including Lawrence Janzten. When Vosser and Tate
 recapture Lili, Tate brings Lili to the horrifying realization that she now
 has a CVI aural/optic implant, making her their eyes and ears.

 In the makeshift prison, Jantzen rigs a solar-powered message, hoping someone
 will discover he is still alive. Liam confronts Renee in her office and she
 explains that she was attempting to rescue Jonathan Doors at the safe house.
 She then reveals that she is also searching for Jantzen and tells Liam about
 the mysterious locator signal and information she obtained from Sandoval's
 computer. She informs Liam that Alcott Inc. is the manufacturer of the CVI
 technology. Liam's research reveals that the CVI shipped was an experimental
 covert surveillance CVI, confirming Renee's theory of human experimental
 implants and the possibilities of shipping prisoners out of the solar system.

 Augur deciphers the location of Jantzen's transmission and Liam and Renee
 leave to free Jantzen and the other prisoners. Back at Sandoval's facility,
 Lili rips off her dog tags, scratches a message onto them, and tries to wedge
 them out her cell window. She accidentally cuts her finger and, to her
 astonishment, sees that her blood is black. When Sandoval finishes making
 arrangements with Tate to blow up the facility, he enters Lili's sealed tent
 and, examining her cut finger, tells her that her physiology is no longer
 Earth-based. Sandoval ushers Lili into a nearby shuttle and sends her into
 interdimensional space.

 Meanwhile, Renee and Liam enter the prison just as Vosser finishes planting
 the explosive devices. At Tate's urging, Sandoval boards the ID Portal and
 leaves. As Liam and Renee follow the voices of the prisoners, shots are
 fired. After taking out Vosser, Liam and Renee free the prisoners. Amid the
 chaos, Liam doesn't notice Lili's dogtags, etched with the words "FIND ME,"
 lying in the gutter.

 The next day, Liam approaches Sandoval with his discovery of the rogue
 Volunteer's identity - Erika Vosser. From a distance, Liam and Renee watch
 Lawrence Jantzen and his family in the park while space cruisers fly overhead
 and Lili speeds through space on a flight to the unknown.

 @{b}Emancipation [#47]@{ub} (1999)

 Three uniformed Volunteers named Peter, Alan and Ehrengraf enter the Earth
 Abides Political Club. When Ehrengraf meets opposition as she interrogates a
 party member, she Skrill blasts the club. Liam Kincaid is assigned to find the
 renegade Volunteers and stop the abuse of power.

 Augur, who has suffered great losses during a market correction, sorts out the
 last of his art pieces to put up for auction as the holo-accountant balances
 his books. Liam asks Augur to help him locate the Volunteers, but Augur
 informs him that the Resistance is no longer his fight. Augur insists that
 Liam use his own devices to solve the Skrilling incident.

 Renee Palmer, anticipating a backlash from the attack, asks Liam if he knows
 how to get hold of the new "user-friendly" Skrills used in the incident -
 Skrills operable by non-officers without CVI implants. Liam and Da'an visit
 Dr. Linford at the Skrill Development Centre to discuss the theft of a
 Skrill prototype. They learn that the Skrill Queen, the mother of all
 Skrills in service, has been stolen. Meanwhile, Ehrengraf, Peter, and Alan,
 who have taken the pregnant Queen, return to their hidden loft where they
 are keeping her.

 When Zo'or discovers the Skrill Queen has been stolen, he demands that
 Sandoval recover her. Renee identifies Sylvia Ehrengraf, a committed
 Resistance fighter and member of the hard core Resistance cadre Black
 Wednesday, as one of the renegade Volunteers. Liam and Renee team up to
 apprehend Ehrengraf and rescue the Skrill Queen.

 The rogue Volunteers then attempt to kidnap the President of the Society of
 Secular Humanity, Gregos Dinesen, but Dinesen shoots and mortally wounds Alan.

 Back at the loft, Noah Lockhart, a biogeneticist at the Skrill Development
 Centre and committed member of Black Wednesday, checks on the pregnant Skrill
 Queen. He also examines the Skrill bonded on Ehrengraf's arm because she
 experiences pain and nerve damage with every Skrill blast.

 Sandoval interrogates Dr. Linford when he discovers that Alan participated in
 her compatibility survey for the new Skrill prototype. Dr. Linford claims her
 innocence and provides Sandoval the equipment needed to bring the Skrill Queen
 safely to term. Renee convinces Augur to give her information about the
 vigilante Resistance group and she tracks down their secret hideout. Renee and
 Liam take off to apprehend them, but when they arrive at the loft, Ehrengraf
 manages to escape with the Skrill Queen. Sandoval arrives and takes charge of
 Lockhart and Peter while Liam and Renee track down Ehrengraf to the medical
 centre. But Ehrengraf is unwilling to surrender the Skrill Queen. She points
 her Skrill at Liam and starts to blast wildly as she is overcome with pain.
 The blasts get progressively weaker and Ehrengraf and the Skrill die in a
 final violent spasm. Renee wants to keep the Skrill Queen in custody for the
 Resistance, but Liam won't allow it. He scoops up the Queen to "bond" with her
 and is horrified to see how the Taelons have snatched the Skrill nestlings
 from their parents to be re-engineered into weapons. Liam vows to ensure the
 safety and survival of the Skrill and the human race. Liam and Renee take the
 Skrill Queen to the Brazilian rain forest and they watch her maternally guard
 her nest. Suddenly, the Skrill Queen shimmers and a beautiful bird-like energy
 creature emerges becoming the newest addition to the ecosystem.

 @{b}Deja Vu [#48]@{ub} (1999)

 Detective Patricia Sherman requests that Liam Kincaid help her look into the
 deaths of four people, all of whom supposedly died from overloaded synapses.
 Meanwhile, in front of the flagship Mneme salon, Dr. Ray Suriyama answers
 questions for the press about the Mneme, a new Taelon/Doors venture that
 allows people to relive their most cherished memories. Da'an reports the
 progress of the Mneme project to Zo'or and Zo'or informs Da'an he will now
 take over the project. When Da'an agrees with this decision rather quickly,
 Zo'or suspects he has ulterior motives and tells Sandoval to increase his
 surveillance of Da'an. Meanwhile at the Flat Planet Cafe, Augur watches the
 grand opening of the Mneme salon on television with his new silent partner in
 the establishment, Dr. Belman. They watch as Renee Palmer invites Mayor Carter
 Dubois to be the first client. The Mayor relives an erotic memory with a young
 Asian woman, but tells the audience he experienced childhood memories of
 playing baseball. During the reception, Da'an explains to Liam the operating
 principles of the Mneme, giving Liam a possible insight into the mysterious
 deaths - memory overload.

 Later, at Club 101, Liam asks Giselle if her late boyfriend could have
 purchased an illegal Mneme memory. She acknowledges the possibility and tells
 Liam that a guy named Gavin Frost runs a black market Mneme operation in the
 alley behind the club. Liam and Renee find Gavin, and just as Liam is about to
 purchase a memory ride, Sandoval arrives on the scene. Sandoval proceeds to
 discuss issues with Gavin, his business partner, and Renee and Liam steal the
 truck with the Mneme machine. They bring it to Augur for examination and the
 next day, Gavin is found dead.

 While scanning the Mneme, Augur finds several discs stored in a compartment.
 Liam decides to test his theory of memory overload and plugs in a disc, which
 contains memories belonging to SI War veteran Lieutenant McKee. Augur detaches
 Liam from the machine when he begins screaming in pain and Liam concludes that
 Gavin was selling stolen memories.

 Renee discovers the requisitions of all the stolen Mneme parts were made by
 Sanches, a Doors International clerk and employee of Dr. Suriyama. She
 terminates Suriyama's employment and as he leaves, Suriyama tells Renee that
 he possesses the experimental discs and her memories. Liam confronts Da'an
 about the use of the Mneme to eavesdrop on people through their memories.
 Da'an is baffled because he is under the impression that humans want to share
 and evolve toward a unity or commonality like the Taelons.

 Renee fears that Suriyama will flee and take her memory disc with him. She and
 Liam return to the Mneme salon, but when they enter the facility, they are
 caught in a Mneme field and bombarded with their own memories. With the last
 of his strength, Liam fires his energy pistol at the power supply disrupting
 the Mneme machines. The room clears and Dr. Suriyama is found dead. Sandoval
 enters, explaining how he had Suriyama under surveillance for some time, and
 exits without an explanation. Renee and Liam suspect that Sandoval is
 involved, but know they will never be able to implicate him in the bootleg
 Mneme machine deaths. Later, Liam goes to see Lieutenant McKee in a rest home
 and they discuss the outcome of the battle they've both experienced. Liam then
 presents McKee with the Mneme disc, returning his memories.

 @{b}The Once And Future World [#49]@{ub} (1999)

 A smuggler named Gonsalves lands an inflatable motorboat on a beach and makes
 his way to an archeological site. He begins digging and finds a knotted rope,
 an amulet, two small idols and a polyhedron that begins to glow in his hand.
 Alerted by a metallic clank, Gonsalves escapes from the Security Patrol Sentry
 and races to the motorboat with the loot. Later at the Rizzori Gallery,
 Companion Protector Liam Kincaid investigates the authenticity and origin of
 these very objects. Sandoval gives U.S. Customs Agent Carl Praeger 24 hours to
 complete his investigation of the smuggled artifacts before he takes
 possession of them. Liam leaves the showroom and sees Renee Palmer who has
 been sent by Doors International to look into the possibility of these objects
 being of Taelon origin.

 Liam and Renee decide to remove the artifacts that night, before Sandoval
 can claim them. Liam enters the gallery and Renee acts as a look-out in the
 back alley. A guard making his rounds approaches Liam, and Renee fails to
 set off the decoy firebomb outside, forcing Liam to pepper spray the guard.
 Liam grabs the box of artifacts and makes a speedy exit. Later, Augur
 confirms the polyhedron and the idol are of Taelon origin and identifies the
 tangled rope as an Inca Quipu.

 Zo'or and Da'an order Sandoval to retrieve the polyhedron because they
 believe it could be the link between humanity and the Taelons that the
 Taelon scout Ma'el left behind. Meanwhile, in exchange for immunity to
 smuggling charges, gallery owner Vera Rizzori tells Liam that Customs Agent
 Praeger is her silent partner and Gonsalves is the name of her artifact
 supplier. Liam goes to search Praeger's office and is attacked by Gonsalves.
 Renee steps out of the shadows and demands Liam's release. Gonsalves flees
 and Renee intentionally lets him go.

 Later, Augur pinpoints Rio La Yapana as the source of the smuggled artifacts
 and Liam and Renee depart for the exotic locale. They make their way through a
 fisherman's shantytown and spot Gonsalves. Sandoval's shuttle lands and Liam
 goes after Gonsalves while Renee stays with Sandoval. Liam and Gonsalves fight
 in the market, but Gonsalves lands on his own knife, killing himself. Liam
 attempts to contact Renee, but she ignores his call.

 Liam continues the search for the Taelon site and discovers a dim chamber
 full of ancient equipment. He begins to record the items in the chamber on
 his global, but he stops when he hears a weapon being cocked. Liam turns
 around and comes face to face with Renee, a scientific team and Jonathan
 Doors. Renee tells Liam that she purposely tried to prevent him from finding
 Ma'el's ship and Doors tells him that it is imperative that the Taelon
 technology stay in the hands of humans. Doors also tells Liam that he
 discovered Ma'el's ship years before the Taelons landed on Earth. Doors, Liam
 and Renee agree to work together. Liam goes to the Mothership and gives the
 polyhedron, the only Taelon artifact found at the site, to Da'an and Zo'or as
 a memento of Ma'el's visit to Earth. Sandoval confirms great finds of Inca
 relics during his search at the ancient site, but regrets to inform that he
 found nothing of Taelon ancestry.

 between cells. Resistance globals will be able to receive his untraceable
 transmissions, but will be unable to send any. Reluctantly, the leaders agree
 and put their trust in Liam. Back at the hospital, Dr. Allison Curzon and Dr.
 Harlowe run tests on Sandoval and discover he has a rare blood disorder caused
 by genetic mutation. Dr. Curzon injects Sandoval with a yellow serum that
 revives him. Liam is temporarily put in charge of protecting Zo'or, who
 cancels his engagements pending Sandoval's return. Sandoval is told he will
 die unless he gets blood from a first-degree relative. He doesn't believe any
 exist and orders a worldwide search for a DNA match.

 Augur's secret past catches up with him when he finds his
 ex-partner-in-crime, Max, waiting for him. Augur and Max had hacked Federal
 main frames until the IRS caught up with Augur, whose subsequent testimony
 against Max sent him to sensory deprivation prison for six years. Now a
 hardened criminal, Max threatens to kill Liam unless Augur provides him with
 the Resistance's communication codes. Max delivers the information to Da'an,
 who is caught red-handed by Zo'or with knowledge of the Resistance that he
 has not shared. To prove his loyalty, Da'an uses his newfound information
 source to send out a simulated message from Liam summoning all the
 Resistance leaders to an emergency meeting. Liam receives the transmission
 but is unable to send a counter message and several leaders are killed. When
 Liam angrily confronts Augur about his betrayal, Augur explains he did what
 he had to do to save Liam's life and offers to help discover who hired Max.
 Although their relationship is now marred, Liam accepts Augur's offer.
 Meanwhile, Max contacts Zo'or and asks for a hundred million dollars in
 exchange for the Resistance's leader.

 Even though Liam reports to Sandoval while he is in the hospital, it is not
 until Augur informs Liam that there is a DNA search that he realizes he is the
 only one who can save Sandoval from dying. Liam reveals to Renee that he is,
 in fact, Sandoval's son and was created using Sandoval's body by the alien
 named Ha'gel. Despite Renee's protests that Sandoval is the enemy, Liam feels
 compelled to donate his blood. To preserve Liam's anonymity, Renee offers to
 draw the blood which is dropped off at the hospital.

 Augur discovers that a Taelon invention, "smart money," makes it possible to
 trace cash transactions to the previous owners. Posing as a new client, Liam
 meets with Max in hopes of getting some of the cash with which he was paid.
 Max is surprised to see his "target" wants to hire him and teases that Zo'or
 is prepared to pay a fortune to reveal his identity. The two battle with
 needle swords - light sabre-like weapons which can cut through anything but
 themselves. Liam manages to kill Max and recover a $100 bill which implicates
 Da'an. Seething, Liam confronts Da'an, who justifies his actions claiming that
 he had to regain Zo'or's trust and assures Liam that he is protected because
 he is indispensable to the Taelons' survival. Sandoval recovers and learns
 that somewhere he has a son.

 @{b}A Little Bit Of Heaven [#51]@{ub} (1999)

 A teenage girl barely escapes from the small town of Taelonville, Indiana
 through an interdimensional (ID) portal. Her twin teenage pursuers, Belle
 and Steve Hartley are worried that her memory wasn't sufficiently erased
 before she escaped. Although the twins look like regular teenagers, their
 glowing eyes suggest they are Taelons. Belle and Steve return to their
 house and hook themselves up to IVs and electrodes. Meanwhile, Dr. Park
 calls Liam to share her examination results from a Jane Doe patient, the
 same girl who escaped from Taelonville. She explains that in addition to
 having amnesia, the teenager's three-month-old fetus was seemingly removed,
 not by surgery, but by Taelon ID travel technology. Liam shares these
 findings with Renee and she probes Zo'or for more information. But Zo'or
 knows nothing about reviving the human genetic research project, nor the
 use of ID technology to perform non-invasive surgery. Zo'or orders Sandoval
 to find out if a covert operation exists.

 Meanwhile, Liam goes to Taelonville to do a little investigating on his own.
 He enlists the help of the local sheriff, Bob Highland, who explains that the
 Taelons restored the town after a nuclear meltdown. Highland introduces Liam
 to Carrie Drake, the proprietor of a local restaurant, and the Hartley twins,
 none of whom admit to having seen the teenage girl. While Belle and Steve
 privately lament how Da'an abandoned them, Highland praises how the Taelons
 saved the twins from the radiation poisoning that killed their parents.

 Back on the mothership, Sandoval questions Da'an about the use of ID
 technology and convinces him to share his knowledge before going to Zo'or.
 Da'an explains his part in saving the town of Silent Falls, now
 Taelonville, and his attempt to create a Taelon/ human hybrid, which he now
 feels may help the Taelons triumph in the coming Jaridian invasion.
 Unconvinced at first, Zo'or finally agrees that the continuation of the
 project could serve the Taelons' needs.

 Meanwhile, Belle and Steve kill Carrie Drake and successfully carry out a plot
 to frame Liam for her murder. Liam contacts Renee for help. Upon her arrival,
 she gives Liam a long, deep kiss, transferring to him a lump of gray goo made
 up of millions of minute programmable robots. Renee leaves and Liam transforms
 the goo into a lock-pick. He escapes from his cell, tying up the sheriff. Liam
 meets up with Renee in an alley where she programs the robot goo to seek out
 traces of ID technology throughout the town.

 Meanwhile, Highland frees himself and pursues Liam and Renee with a pack of
 men. The nanorobot goo discovers Steve and Belle's attic and sends a message
 to Renee. Renee and Liam enter the house, unaware that they are being watched
 by one of Highland's men. When they go to the attic they see a maze of melded
 human and Taelon technology and five artificial Taelon wombs, all but one of
 which hold Taelon/human infants. Belle cradles a baby and Steve threatens to
 blast the other infants. Suddenly, Highland and his men burst into the attic
 and a gun battle erupts. Belle takes the baby and manages to escape through a
 portal door. Highland arrests Steve and reconciles with Liam. A Taleon ID
 shuttle arrives and collects the remaining Taelon/human infants.

 Later at the Taelon embassy, Sandoval reports to Liam and Da'an that Belle and
 the baby have not been found. Liam exits the room and Belle appears with the
 child. Da'an greets them with open arms and Belle pledges her allegiance to
 the Taelons. Da'an then assures her that he will get Steve released from jail.

 @{b}Pad'Ar [#52]@{ub} (1999)

 Liam and Augur are at the Flat Planet Cafe watching an ultimate warrior
 competition, known as Pad'Ar, on the monitors. The restaurant is packed and
 several of the customers wear JackPatches, virtual reality-like devices
 manufactured by Doors International that allow the wearer to see and feel
 everything that happens in the ring. Liam doesn't trust the JackPatches and
 watches closely as wearer Vernon Getz experiences mild seizures while wearing
 the device. Vernon comes to and Arcadia Frost, the most popular Pad'Ar
 warrior, defeats her opponent. The following day, Renee brings Arcadia, who is
 sponsored by Doors International, to the Flat Planet Cafe to greet her fans.
 Liam makes his concerns regarding the JackPatches known to Renee and notices
 that Vernon is not around. Renee leaves to go work out with Arcadia and Liam
 goes to see Da'an to learn more about Pad'Ar. He learns that Pad'Ar was
 originally a means to solve disputes among the Taelons in ancient times that
 evolved into a sacred ritual. Da'an also tells Liam that he does not share
 Zo'or's enthusiasm for the way in which Pad'Ar has escalated into a popular
 form of sports entertainment for humans.

 Later, Liam goes to Mercy Hospital and learns that Vernon is being treated by
 Dr. Catlett. She tells Liam that other cases similar to Vernon's have been
 reported across the country and she is trying to establish a link between the
 JackPatches and the disorders.

 Meanwhile, Arcadia and Renee attend a Pad'Ar match on the mothership and
 witness the death of Pad'Ar warrior Sturm during the fight. Shortly after the
 match, Dr. Kronkeit announces that Sturm's death was caused by an undiagnosed
 neurological disorder and insists that all Pad'Ar warriors submit to a test to
 ensure they are not predisposed to the same condition. Renee informs Liam of
 Dr. Kronkeit's findings and Liam proposes the possibility of reverse
 neurofeedback from the JackPatches.

 On the mothership, Zo'or reprimands Sandoval for not choosing better subjects
 to be Pad'Ar warriors and expresses his concerns about the effect that Sturm's
 death may have on their future plans. Zo'or and Sandoval have offered the
 nations of the world the first supersoldier, the Pad'Ar warrior, and a bidding
 war has begun between the top military powers. Meanwhile, Augur discovers that
 the neurological disorder that caused Sturm's death only affects people over
 the age of 60. Liam goes to see Dr. Catlett and discovers that she and Vernon
 were planning to defraud Doors International by suing for seizures caused by
 the JackPatches. He arrests them both for insurance fraud, but the mystery
 behind Sturm's death still remains.

 Renee becomes suspicious of Arcadia's age and asks her what her favourite
 childhood toy was. Arcadia, suspecting nothing, tells her it was the Crash
 Baxter ray gun that her father got for her at a World's Fair. Augur scans
 Arcadia's DNA. He discovers that she and all of the other Pad'Ar warriors are
 former military soldiers between the ages of 65 and 90 that have been living
 in VA hospitals. Further analysis reveals that all of the Pad'Ar warriors have
 one common DNA strand, which leads to the discovery that they are improved
 bio-surrogates. Renee and Liam confront Arcadia with this information and she
 tells them that Sandoval offered her this new life. They conclude that Zo'or
 and Sandoval are creating perfect soldiers to fight the Jaridians. Arcadia
 returns to the mothership and is attacked by two Pad'Ar warriors who are under
 orders from Sandoval to destroy her. Arcadia kills one of the warriors and
 Liam arrives in time to destroy the other. He takes Arcadia to Augur's lair
 where Renee and Arcadia apologize to each other and renew their friendship
 despite their differences. Liam and Renee reveal their ties to the Resistance
 to Arcadia and relocate her to ensure her safety.

 @{b}In Memory [#53]@{ub} (1999)

 Lili Marquette awakens on a shuttle thousands of light years away from
 Earth. A laser beam cuts through the shuttle's hull and a Jaridian enters
 the chamber. Suddenly, a Taelon warship arrives and engages the shuttle in
 battle. The shuttle takes a direct hit and is engulfed in white light,
 leaving Lili's fate uncertain. Later, Lili finds herself a patient at a
 military hospital. Dr. Michael Reed tells Lili that she has been in a coma
 for three years and that her CVI has been removed. Liam soon arrives and
 Lili learns that the Taelons, defeated by the Jaridians, have left Earth
 forever. Liam tells Lili that she is responsible for saving Earth and that
 Sandoval is scheduled to be executed.

 Soon, Lili is debriefed by Colonel Bramson and learns that Sandoval's last
 request is to speak with her. She reluctantly agrees when she realizes that
 this will be her only chance to find out why Sandoval sent her out on a
 shuttle in the first place. But Sandoval only reveals to Lili that he now has
 his own Resistance, made up of faithful Taelon followers, and that they will
 kill her. Lili then goes to have lunch with Augur and finds out that he is
 the CEO of a large company and has a wife and child. Dr. Reed and Colonel
 Bramson watch Lili and Augur from across the cafeteria and they mysteriously
 discuss the need to win Lili's trust.

 Later that night, Tate, one of Lili's old enemies, tries to kill her, but
 Liam thwarts the assassination attempt. Security is tightened the following
 day and Dr. Reed suggests to Lili that watching Sandoval's execution may aid
 in her recovery. Lili agrees, but leaves in disgust when Sandoval screams
 that his CVI made him commit his crimes. Later, Liam gives Lili her old
 dogtags. To her surprise, the words "find me," which she had previously
 etched on them, are not there. Lili then looks at a cut on her hand she
 received before the coma and notices that it hasn't healed. She returns to
 her room, reopens the cut, and is horrified when black blood oozes from the
 wound. Lili realizes something is terribly wrong and faces the possibility
 that she may not even be on Earth.

 Lili confronts Liam and he informs her that they are really on an asteroid and
 Lili is part of an intricate scheme by the Taelons to gain more information
 about the Resistance and the Jaridians. He claims that he, Augur and Dr. Reed
 are prisoners and they didn't tell Lili the truth because they wanted to
 protect her. Liam hands Lili a tiny, broken ID drive from a grounded shuttle
 and tells her that they can all escape if she fixes the mechanism. To confuse
 Lili even more, Dr. Reed and Colonel Bramson inform her that they never
 removed her CVI and suggest immediate surgery. Lili agrees, but during the
 operation she has visions of Jaridians performing the procedure.

 The following day, Lili fixes the ID drive and Dr. Reed tells her that they're
 leaving that night. After dark, Lili and Liam rendezvous with Augur and Dr.
 Reed at the shuttle hangar and engage a group of Volunteers in a gun battle.
 Suddenly, Sandoval and more Volunteers arrive and Sandoval seriously wounds
 Liam. Lili kills Sandoval while Augur and Dr. Reed get Liam on the shuttle.
 Liam dies as Lili installs the ID drive and the Volunteers lower their weapons
 and begin to walk away when shuttle power is restored. Suddenly, the
 surrounding landscape dissolves into Jaridia and the Volunteers morph into
 Jaridians. Augur, Liam and Dr. Reed also transform into Jaridians and inform
 Lili that they created a faux Earth from her own memory to trick her into
 fixing the shuttle's ID drive, enabling them to travel to Earth to battle the
 Taelons. Lili is horrified to realize that she has just given the Jaridians
 the means for interdimensional space travel.

 @{b}The Cloister [#54]@{ub} (1999)

 When Zo'or experiences a series of violent dreams and has difficulty
 maintaining his human appearance, Da'an realizes that Zo'or is entering the
 Taelon reproductive cycle, the ka'ath'am. Believing that Zo'or is a threat to
 himself and those around him, Da'an suggests that he withdraw from all public
 appearances, but Zo'or refuses. Later, Liam Kincaid and Sandoval escort Da'an
 and Zo'or to the Palmer mansion to participate in an Energy Sharing Ceremony
 with a group of women known as The Cloister. These unique women can alter
 their bodies' energy to match the Taelons' energy level, allowing them to
 physically and spiritually bond with the Taelons.

 Later, Renee joins Liam at the mansion and recognizes Sister Elizabeth, an
 ex-Resistance member, and fears that she has divulged Resistance secrets to
 The Cloister and the Taelons. Liam questions the head of The Cloister, Sister
 Margaret, about Sister Elizabeth's background and Renee questions Sister
 Elizabeth about her motives for entering The Cloister. Later, Sister Margaret
 finds Sister Elizabeth dead and floating in a meditation water tank. Forensic
 Officer Eric "Rabbit" Salinger concludes that she died from drowning and
 electrocution by an unknown energy source. Suddenly, the Interdimensional
 Shuttle explodes and destroys the mansion's electric generator and all means
 of transportation. Liam observes Da'an leaving the scene of the explosion, but
 Da'an refuses to offer Liam any explanations as to why he was there.

 Later, Zo'or sees a series of violent images of Sister Elizabeth's murder
 while being questioned by Metro Homicide Detective Mitch Corelli. Meanwhile,
 Sandoval catches Renee in the act of searching Sister Elizabeth's room, but
 she covers herself by stating her concern about the murder and its impact on
 Doors International. Sandoval has already searched the room and found
 Elizabeth's diary, which contains information about her previous ties to the
 Resistance. He reveals this to Renee, confirming her suspicion that Sandoval
 had beaten her to the diary.

 "Rabbit" informs Liam that Sister Elizabeth was pregnant, but their discussion
 is interrupted when another Cloister member, Sister Jenna, is attacked. She
 identifies her attacker as a Taelon, but can't say whether it was Da'an or
 Zo'or. Liam learns from Sister Margaret that every woman in The Cloister,
 except for her, is pregnant.

 "Rabbit" and Liam eliminate the possibility of any non-Taelon energy source as
 the cause of the deaths and attempt to identify the killer by isolating Taelon
 energy signatures. They watch the tape of the ceremony and determine that
 Da'an must be the killer because he was the last Taelon to touch Sister
 Elizabeth. But after replaying the tape frame by frame, Liam notices that
 Sister Margaret transformed into a Taelon blue state after touching Zo'or.
 Suddenly, a piercing scream sends Liam running to the meditation room to find
 Sister Margaret, glowing Taelon blue, attacking Renee. Liam restrains Sister
 Margaret and she begins to emanate energy pulses, slowly killing herself.
 Before she dies, Sister Margaret confesses to murdering Sisters Elizabeth in a
 jealous rage because she could not procreate.

 Liam theorizes that Sister Margaret must have shared a special link with Zo'or
 because of the way she channelled his energy. Liam also calls attention to
 Da'an's strange behaviour and suspects him of tampering with evidence to cover
 up for Zo'or, but Da'an deflects the accusations. Back on the mothership,
 Da'an reprimands Zo'or for his total disregard for public safety and Taelon
 interests while experiencing the ka'ath'am. But Zo'or is more concerned with
 the fact that he is the only Taelon who will never reproduce. Zo'or, the last
 of the Taelons, demands to know why Da'an concealed the truth. He figures that
 Da'an wanted to keep the secret that without humanity, the Taelons are a
 doomed race. But Da'an insists that he only wanted to protect his child, who
 is none other than Zo'or!

 @{b}Interview [#55]@{ub} (1999)

 Veteran news reporter Shelly George discovers a Taelon probe in a forest and
 is engulfed by high-voltage electronic pulses when the probe ruptures. Four
 years later, Shelly, now the producer of "The Eli Hanson Show," is determined
 to broadcast the first live television interview with a Companion. Renee
 Palmer helps Shelly get a meeting with Zo'or to pitch the idea. Obviously
 quite ill, Shelly excuses herself while Zo'or considers the proposal. Shelly
 adjusts her electronic Synaptic Nerve Suppressor to relieve a wave of pain.
 Meanwhile, Liam Kincaid expresses his concern to Renee about the interview
 because he believes that it might increase public support for the Companions.

 Zo'or agrees to the live interview, but soon after he and Sandoval are alerted
 to a security breach in the Taelon Archives. Meanwhile at the Taelon Embassy,
 Da'an assures Liam he has taken the necessary steps to insure that mankind
 will be aware of Zo'or's contempt for humanity. The next day, Shelly meets
 Troy Sarrazin, a known anti-Taelon activist, who gives her a disk containing
 secret Taelon information. As the TV crew sets up for the broadcast and the
 audience filters in, Renee recognizes Troy, who is in disguise, taking a seat
 in the audience gallery. She brings this to Liam's attention and Liam
 approaches Troy and asks him to leave quietly. Sandoval also notices Troy and
 immediately dispatches Volunteers to apprehend him. Troy panics and runs, but
 is eventually tackled by Liam. Sandoval orders Liam to escort Troy to the
 shuttle that will take him to the mothership. Thinking there may be other
 extremists in the audience, Sandoval implores Zo'or to cancel the interview.
 But Zo'or refuses because he doesn't want to appear intimidated and weak.

 Eli Hanson takes the stage and introduces a video montage that highlights the
 Taelons' accomplishments. After Liam leaves the building with Troy, Shelly
 activates a security system override that locks all the studio doors. She then
 walks onstage and tells the audience that she will expose the dark side of the
 Taelon agenda. A Volunteer rushes the stage and Shelly fires a wave of energy
 from her electronic Synaptic Nerve Suppressor. Volunteers surround Shelly and
 she calmly announces that she is dying from exposure to Taelon radiation and
 intends to kill Zo'or with the next blast from her Suppressor.

 Shelly airs the stolen Taelon archival tapes and Liam discovers he is locked
 out of the studio. Renee contacts Liam on his global and informs him that
 Shelly has taken over the broadcast and has left a suicide note in her office.
 He sends for Augur to help break the electromagnetic field and Augur
 ascertains that the fallout from breaking the electromagnetic pulse would kill
 everyone in the building. Augur begins to repair the interdimensional portal
 as a possible entrance into the studio and Liam retrieves a Taelon shuttle
 crash pack that will form a protective glass bubble around him should Shelly
 fire a blast at him from her Suppressor.

 Liam jumps into the portal and materializes on stage. Shelly fires at him
 and activates the crash pack. But the crash bubble encases her and the pulse
 blast from her Suppressor. The electromagnetic pulse blast explodes and
 Shelly disintegrates. The electromagnetic field within the bubble expands
 and causes the bubble to contort. Zo'or places his hands on the bubble just
 as it's about to explode and absorbs all the energy, saving everyone's life.
 Liam is grateful to be alive, but tells Renee that because this entire
 fiasco was televised, Zo'or now looks like a hero, which is the last thing
 they wanted. Meanwhile, Da'an, who provided Troy with the Taelon archival
 footage, visits the imprisoned activist on the mothership and ponders the
 impact of its airing.

 @{b}Keep Your Enemies Closer [#56]@{ub} (1999)

 En route to a diplomatic assembly, Liam Kincaid and Zo'or are called back to
 the mothership by the Synod for an emergency meeting. Upon reentry from ID
 space, their shuttle collides with an old space booster and hurtles towards
 Earth, crashing in Sunlight Basin, Wyoming. Naraina Durrant, a resident of a
 local commune of natural purists known as the Children of the Earth, rescues
 Liam from his crash bubble and assists him in the search for Zo'or. Meanwhile
 on the mothership, Da'an greets T'than, the Taelon War Minister who has called
 the emergency meeting to propose that Da'an take Zo'or's place as the Synod
 leader. T'than later questions Sandoval about Zo'or's private ambitions.

 Renee Palmer discovers that Liam and Zo'or are missing and Da'an assures her
 that Zo'or is still alive and linked to the Commonality. Da'an instructs
 Sandoval to broaden his search for the missing shuttle. Meanwhile, Liam
 tries to call for emergency assistance, but his global hisses with static.
 Liam and Naraina continue to look for Zo'or's crash bubble and are
 approached by Jason, Kyle and Byron Durrant, Naraina's father and leader of
 the commune. Liam is unable to stabilize the pulsating ID drive of the pod,
 so he detaches it and dumps it over a cliff just as it explodes. The air
 clears and they discover the crash bubble containing the wounded Zo'or. The
 group, with the exception of Liam, is in awe of Zo'or, for they have cut
 themselves off from the outside world and had no idea that Taelons even
 existed. Kyle and Naraina help Liam contain Zo'or's remaining energy and
 they bring him to Kyle's home at the commune.

 Byron announces to his followers that he will fast and search for clear vision
 of the truth and decide whether to provide further assistance to Liam and
 Zo'or. Naraina brings some food to Liam and explains to him her father's
 vision of the Star Saviors. She says that her father believes that beings from
 the sky, the Star Saviors, will come to their commune and help its inhabitants
 return to present-day society. Later, Liam witnesses Byron handing Jason an
 energy weapon from a secret compartment in his cabin and overhears him
 instructing Jason to stand guard and protect the commune. Concluding that
 Byron is quickly drifting into madness, Liam enters the cabin after they leave
 and retrieves energy clips from the rifles locked in the secret compartment.

 Later that night, Liam asks the residents of the commune for help and
 confronts Jason about the objects in the secret compartment. Meanwhile in
 his cabin, Byron secretly watches reports from Washington on Zo'or's
 supposed death on his global.

 Renee, unable to ascertain any information about Liam or Zo'or on the
 mothership, leaves to join Augur, who has pinpointed the location of the
 shuttle using old NORAD maps tracking NASA debris still in orbit. Renee
 immediately dispatches a rescue unit. With the help of Naraina and Kyle, who
 realize that Byron is bordering on lunacy, Liam escapes the commune with
 Zo'or, while Jason secretly trails them. They return to the wreckage site and
 Liam and Naraina wire Zo'or to the shuttle, hoping Zo'or will provide enough
 energy to power the shuttle and get them to safety. Byron's group of devoted
 followers approaches the shuttle site with energy weapons and open fire as the
 shuttle takes off. Byron is about to fire the energy blast that would bring
 the shuttle crashing down, but Naraina shoots an arrow that pierces his gun,
 rendering it useless. Liam maneuvers the shuttle to safety. Later on the
 mothership, Da'an greets Liam with a Taelon touch of affection and questions
 Liam about the wisdom of rescuing his enemy Zo'or.

 @{b}Subterfuge [#57]@{ub} (2000)

 On the mothership, Zo'or discusses with Ram, the Latin American Companion, his
 idea to make President Thompson an advisor to the Synod. Ram opposes the plan
 and leaves to find his Protector, Tonio Arias. Meanwhile, Tonio is approached
 by Sandoval, who secretly attaches a microchip to Tonio's skrill. Ram and
 Tonio enter the ID portal and emergency lights begin flashing. With the
 exception of Zo'or and Sandoval, the crew on the bridge watches in horror as
 Ram and his Protector are killed in ID space.

 Meanwhile, Liam Kincaid and Da'an wait for artist Hannah Klein, who is going
 to make a fractal-sculpture of Da'an. Hannah arrives and it's obvious there is
 a mutual attraction between her and Liam. Da'an suddenly senses a disturbance
 in the Commonality and Sandoval contacts Liam through his global and informs
 him of Ram's death. Zo'or later informs T'than that his ally Ram is dead.
 T'than becomes suspicious of Zo'or because Ram's death shifts the balance of
 power in the Synod to Zo'or's favor. Meanwhile, Liam travels to El Salvador to
 investigate Tonio's home and is disturbed by how overly neat it is. Sandoval
 contacts Liam and tells him that Tonio is now a suspect because the lab
 confirmed that Tonio was holding something that created a vortex in the ID
 field. Later, Liam goes to see Renee and tells her that Tonio's CVI would have
 prohibited him from murdering Ram. Meanwhile Sandoval goes to see Hannah at
 her loft. It becomes apparent that Hannah has been hired by Sandoval to find
 out what ties Liam has with the Resistance. Hannah vows that Liam will tell
 her every secret he ever knew.

 Liam and Renee go to the Flat Planet Cafe and give Augur a disk that contains
 all the data from the portal accident. Liam and Sandoval return to Tonio's
 home in El Salvador and locate a secret room that contains an array of
 anti-Taelon newsletters and Resistance propaganda, along with a photo of
 Hannah Klein. Liam looks at the photo in shock, while Sandoval feigns concern.

 Renee learns that Hannah's father was an ID technician before he was killed
 and Sandoval assigns Liam to get close to her to find out what she knows.
 T'than tells Da'an about his proposal to bring all the Taelons to live on
 Earth after reengineering it to duplicate their homeworld. Da'an doesn't
 approve of this idea because it will virtually wipe out the human race. Da'an
 exits and Zo'or, who was eavesdropping on the conversation, enters. He tells
 T'than that the Taelons' greatest weakness is the Commonality and that it
 should be destroyed. Meanwhile, Hannah files her report with Sandoval, which
 states that Liam is a loyal Companion Protector with no ties to the
 Resistance. Sandoval doesn't buy this report, so he implants a locator
 microchip into Hannah's arm to track her movements.

 Later, Hannah waits for Da'an at the embassy. T'than arrives with Sandoval,
 who has rigged the security alarm to go off. As soon as it does, Sandoval
 instructs Hannah to take T'than through the portal. Liam enters the room and
 thinks that Hannah is going to kill T'than when he sees them together inside
 the portal. Liam leaps into the portal and the three of them disappear into ID
 space. Liam notices the glowing chip on Hannah's arm and she tells him that
 Sandoval put it on her. Liam overloads his ion pistol and it tears a hole in
 the vortex, releasing them from ID space. T'than and Liam survive, but Hannah
 dies in Liam's arms. T'than and Da'an know that Zo'or was behind T'than's
 assassination attempt. To further gain Da'an's allegiance, T'than tells Da'an
 that he has changed his mind about recreating their homeworld on Earth.

 @{b}Scorched Earth [#58]@{ub}

 Liam Kincaid and Renee Palmer watch a holographic docudrama that Renee
 produced about her close friend, Colonel Dennis Robillard, who heroically
 averted nuclear conflict during the SI War. The film also deals with the
 destructive Quantum Vortex weapon that was mysteriously launched during the
 war and killed 100,000 people. Neither China nor India claimed responsibility
 for the weapon and no one ever found out who was responsible for it. Liam
 commends Renee on the film and she tells him that she's trying to persuade
 Robillard to join Doors International's co-ventures project with the Taelons.
 Sandoval reaches Liam on his global and tells him that an embassy has just
 been bombed. Later, Doors informs Renee that there has been a security breach
 at the company, but he has no idea what was stolen. They decide not to tell
 Zo'or about the theft because they fear that he will limit their access to
 Taelon technology. Liam feels that the embassy bombings may lead to another
 international conflict. He goes to Robillard to seek his help with the
 investigation, but Robillard declines. Renee tells Doors that she wants to
 approach Robillard about joining the Resistance, but Doors thinks it's too
 risky. Liam goes to see Da'an at the Taelon embassy and receives a warning on
 his global that the embassy is about to be destroyed. Liam and Da'an escape
 through a portal just as the embassy is struck by an energy projectile.

 Sandoval leads the investigation on the embassy attack and Zo'or immediately
 blames the Resistance. Sandoval is shocked when his forensic unit discovers
 that the embassy was assaulted by a Quantum Vortex. Doors visits Robillard to
 try to convince him to join the co-ventures project, but Robillard makes it
 clear that he will never use Taelon technology. But as soon as Doors leaves,
 Robillard pulls out a Taelon device and begins to work on it. Meanwhile,
 Sandoval learns that traces of radiation found only in Doors/Taelon co-venture
 technology were found at the assaulted embassy. He brings Renee in for
 questioning and Doors tells Zo'or about the break-in to try to get Renee off
 the hook. Sandoval decides to release Renee and tells her that the favor will
 be returned some day. Meanwhile, Augur and Liam hack into Doors
 Internationals' database and discover that the theft was an inside job,
 designed to point suspicion at Renee. Everyone soon realizes that Robillard is
 the one responsible for the bombings.

 Renee and Liam go to Robillard's research facility and find him working on a
 recreation of the Quantum Vortex. They think Robillard is the one who launched
 the weapon in the SI War, but Robillard informs Liam and Renee that it was
 actually the Taelons who were responsible for that bombing. Liam tells him
 that's impossible because the Taelons had not yet arrived. But Robillard
 insists that Taelons had secretly inhabited the Earth years prior to the war.
 Robillard continues by saying he intends to use the Quantum Vortex to destroy
 the mothership, killing every Taelon. Renee knows that the shockwave created
 by the mothership explosion will destroy the entire eastern seaboard of the
 United States. But Robillard believes that would be an acceptable loss to rid
 the world of Taelons. Robillard arms the weapon with 30 seconds to detonation.
 Liam contacts Sandoval on his global to warn him of the attack, but Sandoval
 doesn't have enough time to put the mothership into ID space. Liam quickly
 reverses the polarity of the Vortex, which will cause a tornado inside the
 facility when the weapon fires. Liam pulls Renee into the Vortex and the
 weapon detonates, instantly killing Robillard.

 Later, Zo'or and Da'an discuss the repercussions of using the Vortex during
 the SI War. They wanted to prevent nuclear holocaust, but keep humanity in a
 state of war so the Taelons could come in and play saviors. Da'an now believes
 there must have been a better way to accomplish this and admits to Liam that
 the Taelons did indeed interfere in the SI War. Auger spreads the story about
 the Taelons firing the Vortex, but most people either believe they were doing
 the right thing, or they don't care one way or the other.

 @{b}Sanctuary [#59]@{ub} (2000)

 Zo'or absorbs the contents of an ancient Taelon vial discovered near Ma'el's
 ship and suddenly collapses. The Taelon healer Mit'gai informs Liam Kincaid
 that Zo'or has contracted Pesh'tal, an ancient deadly plague for which there
 is no known cause or cure. Mit'gai warns that an epidemic could start among
 the Taelons, but the risk to humanity is unknown. Liam informs Renee Palmer
 about Pesh'tal and she suggests using the virus to create a biological weapon
 to fight the Taelons. Renee and Liam recruit Augur to research Pesh'tal and
 the possibilities of designing a weapon. Meanwhile at the Taelon Embassy,
 T'than is appointed by the Synod to oversee matters during Zo'or's
 incapacitation. Later, Liam pockets a vial of Zo'or's infected energy for
 Augur's research and Zo'or disappears.

 Meanwhile at the Bushnell Psychiatric Institute, Kelly and Tom sneak out
 while Dr. Elaine DeParis finishes bed checks. Zo'or portals to a park across
 the street from the Bushnell Institute and exchanges pleasantries with the
 newsstand proprietor Saied. Zo'or walks through the park and comes across
 Kelly and Tom, who suspect that Zo'or is lost. They bring Zo'or back to the
 institute and put him in an abandoned fallout shelter. Unbeknownst to Kelly
 and Tom, they are observed by Max, another patient at the hospital.
 Meanwhile, Mit'gai informs Liam that humans exposed to the virus are in
 danger and will experience psychotic episodes. He also tells Liam that Zo'or
 will eventually release enough neutron energy to cover a 50 mile radius that
 will cause a plague of madness and turn humans into homicidal psychopaths
 within in minutes.

 Liam and Sandoval learn that Zo'or is in New York City and Liam is approached
 by the newsstand proprietor Saied who informs Liam that Zo'or entered the
 Bushnell Institute. Liam becomes suspicious after talking to Tom, who is
 extremely nervous. Liam and Renee gain access to the hospital when they pose
 as a couple looking for accommodations for a relative. Max approaches Liam
 and tells him that he's seen Zo'or. Orderlies escort Max away and Liam and
 Renee leave the hospital believing that Zo'or is somewhere in the building.
 Meanwhile, T'than orders Sandoval to ensure that Zo'or is found dead and
 Sandoval accepts the position as T'than's Companion Protector. Later, Mit'gai
 develops anti-toxin patches for the virus and informs Sandoval that Zo'or
 will reach the lethal level of toxicity in a matter of hours. Meanwhile,
 Augur isolates the Pesh'tal virus, develops a Pesh'tal Geiger counter and
 pinpoints Zo'or's location at the hospital. Protected by the anti-toxin
 patches, Liam and Renee go to the institute. Max observes Tom and Kelly
 leaving the fallout shelter and informs Dr. DeParis. She and a couple of
 security guards find Zo'or and are zapped by an energy wave that pulses from
 Zo'or's body. Liam and Renee discover Zo'or's hiding room, but Zo'or has left
 the shelter through another door and is running for the portal. Liam reaches
 Zo'or before he can get away and applies an anti-toxin patch to Zo'or's neck.
 After recovering, Zo'or confronts T'than about his ambitious plans and Renee
 confirms the anti-toxin patches negate any possibility of using the virus as
 a weapon against the Taelons.

 @{b}Through Your Eyes [#60]@{ub} (2000)

 At the Taelon Embassy, Da'an presents the Taelon Galactic Database to
 reporters as Liam Kincaid patrols the periphery. Scott Pierce steps into an
 alcove and pulls out a Hammerlin CD-57 Pulse Gun with an attached
 transducer. Pierce fires energy pulses that penetrate the virtual glass of
 the embassy and runs away. Liam and Da'an are stunned to see gaping holes in
 the virtual glass that is impervious to all human weapons. Sandoval and Liam
 find the CD-57 gun and the transducer. Liam requests all surveillance
 videotapes to identify the shooter. Sandoval tells Liam that he does not
 want information about the attack released to the press. But later on the
 mothership, Sandoval informs Zo'or that he has leaked all the information to
 SatNet News, as per their plan.

 Renee later informs Liam that the Taelons had initiated and lost a lawsuit
 against Hammerlin Guns, arguing it was possible to modify the pulse weapon to
 make it a more powerful. Later, Chief of Staff Hubble Urick meets with Renee
 to attain her support for his future political career. Augur identifies Scott
 Pierce from the tapes, but discovers that Pierce is a patient at St. John's
 Neurological Center. Later on the mothership, Zo'or enters a secret room that
 holds Pierce's comatose body. Zo'or inputs instructions into a machine and
 Zo'or's Taelon energy is transferred into Pierce's body. Sandoval enters the
 secret room and cautions Zo'or about the dangers of being inside Pierce's
 damaged body. Sandoval cannot guarantee Zo'or's safety, but Zo'or/Pierce
 insists the risk is worth it to further his knowledge of human experiences.

 Zo'or/Pierce goes to a bar and Sandoval monitors Deegan and the two thugs he
 hired to attack Zo'or/Pierce. But Zo'or/Pierce beats up the thugs and kills
 Deegan. Sandoval enters the bar and finds the exhilarated Zo'or/Pierce with
 blood on his hands. Later on the mothership, Sandoval and Zo'or tend to
 Pierce's battered body, and Sandoval again cautions Zo'or about the
 continuation of his experiments.

 At St. John's Neurological Institute, Liam meets with Dr. Nigel Fields and
 learns that Pierce has been in a coma for three months. After being denied
 access to Pierce, Liam leaves and Dr. Fields reports Liam's inquires to
 Sandoval. Disguised as hospital staff, Renee and Liam sneak into Pierce's
 room, where they learn from his wife Erica that the Taelons are helping Scott
 recover from his coma. Later, Renee and Liam meet with Butler, a specialty
 arms dealer, and learn that either the Taelons or the government produced the
 transducer used in the embassy attack. Meanwhile, Augur traces the energy
 signature of Zo'or/Pierce's travels and speculates Pierce is a Taelon.

 Concerned for Zo'or's safety, Sandoval tells Da'an that Zo'or/Pierce attacked
 the Embassy and is conducting transference experiments. Zo'or insists to Da'an
 that in order to manipulate humans to ban energy weapons, the perpetration of
 a high profile crime is necessary. Hubble Urick requests Renee's presence at a
 fundraiser in honor of Zo'or and asks her to be an adviser on Taelon
 relations. Later, Liam traces Zo'or and Pierce's movements and confirm they
 are the same person. Just as Liam finds the transfer room, Zo'or/Pierce
 portals out. Liam globals Renee at the fundraiser to inform her of his
 findings just as Zo'or/Pierce materializes. Liam portals in just as
 Zo'or/Pierce is about to kill Hubble Urick. Liam tackles Urick and Sandoval
 prevents Zo'or/Pierce from firing. Sandoval and Zo'or/Pierce return to the
 mothership and Zo'or transfers out of Pierce's body. Upon recovery Zo'or
 orders Sandoval to dispose of Pierce, who has now emerged from his coma. Liam
 learns of Zo'or's plans and he creates a diversion to take the body. Da'an
 confronts Zo'or and Zo'or channels his experiences to Da'an, which troubles
 yet intrigues Da'an. Zo'or believes the human survival instinct will help save
 the Taelons from the Jaridians. Liam and Renee reunite Pierce with his wife
 and allow them a few moments of happiness before they are told the truth and
 hidden from the Taelons.

 @{b}Time Bomb [#61]@{ub} (2000)

 Renee Palmer, Peter Sayers and Dr. Denise Kerlew attempt to penetrate a
 bulkhead found below the control deck of Ma'el's ship with an ultrasonic
 lance. Suddenly, Taelon energy spews out of the bulkhead, killing Sayers
 instantly and knocking Renee and Dr. Kerlew unconscious. Despite Jonathan
 Doors' disapproval, Liam Kincaid brings Augur to the secret Peruvian site of
 Ma'el's ship to aid in the rescue. Augur determines Ma'el's dormant ship has
 come alive and is healing itself from the cut made by the ultrasonic lance.
 Augur remains at the monitor controls and Liam enters the control deck of the
 ship. He finds a groggy Renee and a barely conscious Dr. Kerlew. Just as
 Renee and Liam get Kerlew off the deck, the ship begins a sequence of
 self-destruct commands. Liam stops the sequence, but activates the control
 deck, trapping him and Renee on board.

 Meanwhile on the mothership, Zo'or summons T'than and challenges him to
 p'raj'rath -- a duel to death. Da'an explains to Sandoval that the game
 board foovlashaa is played to the extreme where one player channels all his
 mental energy into a last move and ceases to exist. Da'an appeals to the
 Synod to prohibit p'raj'rath, but his request is rejected. Later, Liam and
 Renee gain access to the upper deck of the ship, but they drop into a black
 vortex and land on a cryo deck where they find numerous pods. A man named
 Salvius Julianus emerges from one of the pods and introduces himself as a
 Roman citizen. Julianus informs Renee and Liam that his last awakening was
 in the 1700's and his final awakening was to occur upon the arrival of the
 Taelons. Liam goes to the control deck and arranges the hazmat helmets to
 transmit visual images to Augur and Doors. They watch as Julianus arrives on
 the control deck and begins to revive the ship's control console. Julianus
 discovers the Taelon mothership and begins transmitting a signal to it. He
 then traps Liam and Renee in virtual glass, believing they are Taelon spies.
 Renee and Liam learn of Ma'el's death and discover that Julianus was offered
 immortality in exchange for waiting for the main force of Taelons to arrive
 on Earth. He was then to judge the Taelons intentions toward the planet on
 behalf of Ma'el.

 Later on the mothership, Sandoval and Zo'or outline a plot to ensure that
 Zo'or will win the foovlashaa match. Zo'or and T'than begin the
 multidimensional game and Da'an tells Sandoval that Zo'or is losing. Sandoval
 calculates the next move on his CVI, transmits the information to a small
 receiver inserted into Zo'or's skull, and Zo'or gains the advantage. Alarms
 summoning the mothership to battle stations sound just as T'than is about to
 die. Ma'el's hologram suddenly appears and declares that it's time for
 judgement. Ma'el's image is replaced by a hologram of Julianus, who declares a
 death sentence for all Taelons on Earth and on the mothership for not heeding
 Ma'el's directions to stay away from Earth and from interfering with the
 humans. Julianus powers up Ma'el's ship to take off on a suicide mission to
 the mothership. Augur sends Taelon control tones through the hazmat helmets,
 releasing Liam and Renee from their glass prisons. Doors and Augur run for
 their lives through the Inca tunnels as Ma'el's ship shoots skyward. Liam and
 Renee become helpless under G forces and Julianus is impaled on the control
 console. Once in orbit, Liam and Renee jump onto the cryo deck and eject from
 the ship in Julianus' pod. Ma'el's ship continues its collision course, but
 detonates before it reaches the mothership. Zo'or does not continue the
 foovlashaa game, leaving Da'an and T'than contemplating future political
 shifts. The cryo pod spins towards Earth and Liam and Renee hope the Taelons
 understand the value Ma'el had placed upon freedom for humanity.

 @{b}The Fields [#62]@{ub} (2000)

 On their way to the Flat Planet Cafe, Renee Palmer and Liam Kincaid stop to
 chat with Devon Zide, a member of the Church of the Companions. Meanwhile,
 Reverend Travis Murray, a leader in the Church of the Companions, and a group
 of Volunteers transport Gina Richardson, Devon's girlfriend, to an unknown
 location against her will to serve on a Mission. The next day, an upset Devon
 meets with Liam to ask for his assistance in locating Gina.

 On the mothership, Zo'or and Sandoval discuss 'the fields' and the
 'dependency' of all Earth based Taelons. Liam visits Reverend Murray and the
 Reverend refuses to disclose Gina's location because she has taken a vow of
 silence and has been sent on a Mission. As Liam leaves, he overhears Reverend
 Murray discussing 'the fields' on his global. Liam questions a very fatigued
 Da'an about the Church of the Companions and 'the fields,' and Da'an suggests
 that Liam further question Reverend Murray. After Liam exits, Sandoval
 produces a container that holds an organic substance. He drops a pinch into
 Da'an's palm, which is immediately absorbed by the Taelon, re-energizing him.
 When Liam tries to contact Devon, he discovers that Devon has also
 disappeared. Just as Volunteers usher Devon to an unknown location, Liam calls
 Reverend Murray, but the Reverend tells Liam that Devon has left the faith and
 he has no knowledge of his whereabouts.

 Later, Liam and Renee convince Augur to give up his vacation to assist them in
 finding Devon and Gina. Liam, posing as Robert Brice from Denver, is invited
 by Samuel, a missionary of the Church, to attend dinner and a sermon. After
 the sermon Liam is introduced to another newcomer, Susan Evans, who is
 actually Renee in disguise. While everyone prepares for bed in the mission
 dormitory, Liam receives a global message from Devon. Liam discusses Devon's
 message with Renee and she tells him that she's feeling ill. Samuel explains
 the food is enhanced with a Taelon additive that acts as a purifying agent and
 assures Renee her body will adjust.

 On the mothership, Reverend Murray and Sandoval tell Zo'or that a 'field' has
 been confiscated by local authorities and that Cary Truit, a human member of
 the Church, has died from an adverse reaction to the additive. Augur analyzes
 the additive and confirms that it's a complex alien vegetation and determines
 that Devon was medicated while leaving his message for Liam. Augur goes to see
 Liam and Renee at the church and informs them of Cary Truit's death and his
 procurement of a crystalline substance discovered on her body. Augur also
 tells them about the increased Volunteer activity in the Medical Examiner's
 office, which leads them to believe that Sandoval is involved.

 Later, Augur reports the discovery of a human component in the crystalline
 substance discovered on Cary's body and the possible location of 'the fields.'
 During the night, Samuel destroys Liam's global and portals Liam, Renee and
 other church members to a Mission. Liam and Renee enter an artificial
 environment where other church members are harvesting a bizarre alien crop. On
 the mothership, Reverend Murray discusses the productivity of each 'field'
 with Zo'or, assuring him the Taelons' steady increase in demand for the
 'kryss' shall be met. Da'an voices his objection to Zo'or that the 'kryss'
 project is located on Earth. Zo'or notes the objection but stresses that the
 project will bring Taelons closer to humans and reiterates the necessity of
 humans to defeat the Jaridians. Augur realizes Liam's global isn't functioning
 and sets out for Norton, Maryland - the location of 'the fields.'

 While Liam and Renee work in 'the fields," they find Devon and Gina and have
 a meal of alien vegetation. Upon arriving in Norton, Maryland, Augur
 discovers the Church has purchased all the land in the area and via a
 satellite hook-up, finds the underground 'field' location. As everyone beds
 down for the night, Renee screams and is overcome by pain. Volunteers pin
 Renee down and siphon the spore 'kryss' out of her body. Liam watches in
 horror as this repeatedly happens to other Missioners until it's his turn.
 Liam suddenly realizes that church members are 'the fields.' As Volunteers
 systematically collect the 'kryss' and leave, Samuel explains the 'kryss' is
 a substance necessary for the Taelons to survive on Earth. While Liam helps
 unload the 'kryss,' he spots Sandoval and overhears him suggesting a joint
 venture to Samuel. Just as Sandoval thinks he's recognized Liam, he's
 notified of a security breach and leaves.

 Augur enters the underground 'field' location, knocks out a Volunteer and
 locates Liam on the Volunteer's global. As Liam is escorted back to his
 workstation, Augur draws Liam's attention and they disable the Volunteer. Liam
 and Augur create a diversion by torching the homeworld Taelon crop. As the
 Missioners are roused to put out the fires, Renee locates Devon and Gina and
 they meet with Augur and Liam. As the fire escalates, Sandoval orders his
 Volunteers to leave, deserting the Missioners and Samuel. Augur leads Liam,
 Renee, Devon and Gina to safety. Finally, Samuel decides to abandon the
 homeworld crop and the Missioners escape through emergency portals.

 Later, Liam demands an explanation for the Taelon use of humanity to harvest
 'kryss.' Da'an justifies the program as necessary for Taelon survival. Liam
 vows to continue to look for homeworld crop plants and to shut them down.
 Da'an assures Liam that another method to sustain the Taelons has been
 discovered, but he will not disclose the method.

 Late at night, Carson Briggs is alone in the New World Commonwealth Bank
 pouring over paperwork. He suddenly hears a hopeless cry and a blue phantasm
 begins to swirl around him. He is chased and tortured by the energy. The
 energy pushes him down onto the floor, whirls around him in a circular motion,
 and sets him on fire. Meanwhile, Liam Kincaid is in a deep sleep and dreams of
 the exact same horrifying events that are happening to Carson Briggs. As
 Carson curls into the fetal position, Liam sits up and gasps for breath.

 The next day, Liam hears of Briggs' death on the news and he goes to the death
 scene. He recalls the events of his dream to the investigating officer Ed
 Galvani. To ensure his credibility, Liam offers a piece of evidence the police
 had not yet found - Briggs' ring. The ring is designed after the bank logo,
 but is also the ancient Taelon hieroglyphic for impurity.

 On the mothership, Zo'or discusses Briggs' untimely death with Sandoval. Zo'or
 informs Sandoval that he wishes to continue with his Special Agenda and orders
 Sandoval to ensure the investigation is finished quickly. Shortly after
 Sandoval leaves, the lights dim and Zo'or hears the same hopeless cry Briggs
 had before he died. Zo'or cries out and the lights become brighter.

 Liam tells Renee about his dream and Briggs' death. He's suspicious of Taelon
 interference and asks Renee to help him investigate. When Liam visits Briggs'
 home, he discovers circular burn marks throughout the house. Suddenly, a blue
 energy appears and Liam follows it. He discovers a Taelon datalog. The energy
 takes the shape of the deceased Taelon Ku'don, who manages to force out the
 word "exile" and disappears. Suddenly, Liam hears loud banging and he hides
 the datalog as commando leader Fisk leads a group of his men into the house.
 Liam overpowers one of the commandos and escapes as Fisk reports to Sandoval.
 Later at Augur's lair, Liam explains to Renee and Augur how Ku'don lead him
 to the hidden datalog.

 Later at the bank, Renee is discussing a loan for Doors International with
 Samuel Priest when Fisk enters the office and indicates that Renee's global
 is a breech of security. When Renee exits, Priest begins to reprimand Fisk
 until Sandoval enters. Sandoval realigns the positions of authority putting
 Fisk in charge of the Special Agenda and threatens Priest. Later, Augur plays
 the tapes Renee took of her meeting at the bank and points out pyschographs
 that indicate Priest was terrified. When Liam meets Galvani at Briggs' home,
 Liam discovers Briggs was burned from the inside out. Augur's findings also
 confirm that Briggs died of Taelon radiation and proposes the specter of
 Ku'don as the possible perpetrator.

 On the mothership, Zo'or is studying a datalog when he suddenly hears an
 unearthly howl and the phantom light of Ku'don appears and exclaims "exile."
 Abruptly, the bridge initiates auto lockdown and emergency decompression.
 Just as Zo'or is about to be sucked into space, Sandoval's laser cuts through
 the control box until manual override is activated. When order is restored,
 Zo'or commands Sandoval to purge the ship's log of the event. Meanwhile at
 the Taelon Embassy, Da'an tells Liam about Taelon spiritual afterlife and
 confirms that if Ku'don's spirit was soiled with money, it would be banished
 from the Commonality.

 Renee Palmer, disguised as Renee Hale, temporary worker at Ozouri Accounting,
 taps the phone lines of the New World Commonwealth Bank building. Later that
 night, Liam is startled from his sleep and his palm explodes into a blue
 flame, branding him with a circle and a dot. Ku'don appears to Liam pleading,
 "destroy them." Meanwhile at the bank, Fisk searches for Briggs' records and
 Sandoval authorizes him to re-code and break any links with Briggs. On the
 mothership, Da'an learns of Zo'or's blasphemous lust for money and the reason
 for Ku'don's malevolent spirit. Ku'don was Zo'or's accountant for Zo'or's
 secret Taelon ventures. Because profit and money is blasphemy for a Taelon,
 Ku'don's spirit is now soiled and cannot rest. Zo'or demands Da'an perform the
 hjarth'ra to banish Ku'don from the Commonality for eternity.

 Renee finishes her overtime work for Ozouri Accounting, sneaks down the
 stairwell and embeds a dart into a portal. Under Augur's guidance, Liam enters
 the bank, proceeds to the vault door, attaches explosives and sets the timer.
 Just as Liam is captured by Fisk, and the explosives are about to detonate,
 Ku'don opens the vault door. Liam throws the explosives into the lobby and
 runs into the bank vault. He downloads all of Briggs' files while Fisk locks
 the front of the vault and proceeds after him. Fisk enters the vault and
 detonates deadly gas. Liam and Fisk fight hand to hand until Liam delivers the
 final blow and grabs Fisk's mask. As Liam tries to open the vault doors,
 Ku'don appears in a serene state and thanks Liam for cleansing the impurity
 and setting him free. Ku'don disappears and burns a hole in the vault,
 allowing Liam to escape.

 Later, Sandoval tells Zo'or about the bank's insolvency and Fisk's death. In
 Augur's lair, Renee and Liam talk about the laundered money of the Taelon
 co-ventures. Just as Augur is about to e-mail financial statements to the news
 agencies, the accounts begin to disappear. In a secret room, Zo'or stands
 alone, surrounded by gold.

 @{b}One Taelon Avenue [#64]@{ub}

 At One Taelon Avenue, Senior Scientist Dr. George Sato begins a test with an
 ID shuttle prototype. Colonel Bud Ackers is sealed in the cockpit and Sato and
 Joshua Doors take their places in the control booth. Sato is informed the
 temperature in the shuttlecraft is rising and Ackers cries out to abort the
 test. Sato complacently continues and the craft explodes, sending everyone
 ducking for cover while Sato calmly watches.

 Later, Joshua Doors tries to persuade Renee Palmer to leave Doors
 International and join him at One Taelon Avene. Jonathan Doors encounters his
 son in Renee's office and the two exchange opinions about business and the ID
 Shuttle Program. Joshua restates his offer to Renee and leaves. Jonathan
 Doors, concerned about his son, asks Liam Kincaid to find out what's really
 going on at One Taelon Avenue.

 At One Taelon Avenue, Renee meets with Joshua while Liam is tracked by
 Control, covert artificial intelligence, as he investigates the accident.
 After Liam questions Beeks about Ackers accident, he enters Sato's office and
 discovers the Taelon-designed Control System. He peruses reports until Sato
 enters and shoves him out of his office. Liam forcefully holds Sato but as
 soon as Sato calms down, he becomes paranoid and begins rambling. Control
 calms Sato and Liam offers him help, but Sato continues rambling and staggers
 out of his office. Liam tries to exit Sato's office, but he becomes locked
 inside. He calls Renee for assistance, but both of their globals cut out.
 Renee leaves to find Liam, but she becomes trapped in the elevator. Control
 informs Renee that assistance is on the way and Renee calmly waits. Control
 then tracks Sato to the test lab and begins a bio-purge function. Sato tries
 to escape the reconfiguring energy walls but they trap and disintegrate him.

 Meanwhile on the mothership, Zo'or and Da'an review the micro-camera
 coverage of Sato's demise. Da'an is concerned that Control may be overriding
 the Taelon programming and creating its own agenda. Sandoval reports he has
 begun an investigation at One Taelon Avenue, but is ordered by Zo'or to
 close his investigation and allow the local police and the building security
 to handle matters. Later, Renee and Liam question Joshua about the ID flight
 project accident reports, but Joshua does not have any answers and does not
 seem to care to investigate.

 Joshua again approaches Renee about joining One Taelon Avenue. When Liam meets
 with Sato's wife Arlene, she suggests her husband was murdered by the project.
 She tells Liam that as the project progressed, her husband became more
 obsessed and insane. Later, Jonathan Doors draws parallels between Sato and
 Joshua's schizophrenic behavior and involvement with One Taelon Avenue. On the
 mothership, Zo'or initiates contact with Control. Zo'or assures Da'an that
 Control is suppressing human creativity and any possible threat to Taelon
 interests, but Da'an is concerned about Control's increasing aggression and
 independence. Zo'or tries to initiate override measures but Control has
 mutated beyond Taelon authority.

 Meanwhile Control exerts its will over Renee and she accepts a position at One
 Taelon Avenue. Later, Renee delivers Sato's project discs to Augur's lair and
 assures Liam and Augur there is no evidence of a conspiracy. Jonathan and
 Joshua Doors discuss business and Joshua expresses his intentions to raid or
 merge with Doors International and offers Jonathan the position of Chairman
 Emeritus. Jonathan shakes Joshua while he pleads with him to come to his
 senses. When Jonathan leaves, Control again exerts its will over Joshua. Augur
 hacks into One Taelon Avenue's system, but does not find anything unusual. He
 meets with Zims, a comp-system engineer who worked on the building. Zims
 explains that the Taelons installed The Artificial Intel program with Control
 Core and escaped after installation through underground routes. When Augur
 purchases the plan disc from Zims, he discovers Sandoval has also purchased a
 copy. Meanwhile, Renee, now employed at One Taelon Avenue, persuades Jonathan
 to meet and discuss a full partnership on the Shuttle Program with Joshua.

 Augur's analysis reveals that Control Core is sending electrochemical signals
 into the One Taelon Avenue building that manipulates free will and also
 affects Taelon intellect. Augur suspects that Control Core is now acting on
 its own without Taelon directives. Augur supplies Liam with a
 neural-adrenaline simulator wristband to block the Control Core's cerebral
 manipulation. Augur and Liam visit Renee just as she is about to return to One
 Taelon Avenue. Liam grabs her as Augur clamps on a wristband. Renee quickly
 returns to herself. She then realizes Jonathan is on his way over to meet with
 Joshua, which Control Core could perceive as a threat. When Jonathan enters
 One Taelon Avenue, Control marks him as "Terminate." Zo'or and Da'an discover
 that Control is operating irrationally and has activated the purification
 function throughout the entire facility. Sandoval is ordered by Zo'or to
 evacuate the building and destroy the operational hardware. At One Taelon
 Avenue, Joshua is on his way to meet his father. Upon Control's command, he
 pulls out a weapon and is ready to execute Control's orders. Augur informs
 Renee and Liam of Jonathan and Joshua's locations and tells them that the
 building has initiated the purification function.

 Meanwhile, Sandoval plants Taelon grenades at the heart of the Control Sphere.
 Control tries to exert its will upon Sandoval, but it doesn't work. Sandoval
 removes the bio- engineered control core, stores it, and detonates the
 grenades. Joshua meets his father and draws his gun. Jonathan offers Joshua
 his simple and honest sentiments hoping to cut through Control's manipulation.
 Joshua lowers his weapon, but Control realizes it has lost its power and forms
 an energy wall to kill Joshua. Jonathan pushes his son out of the way, but the
 energy wall singes Jonathan and sends him over a balcony. Free from Control,
 Joshua tears down the stairs and holds his father as he dies in his arms.

 Da'an and Zo'or watch the elaborate funeral procession of Jonathan Doors from
 the mothership. Doors' death launches an investigation into One Taelon Avenue
 and a debate about entering into technological co-ventures with the Taelons.
 Sandoval enters the bridge and opens the containment case that holds the
 Control Core, sending both Taelons into catatonic states. Sandoval pockets the
 Control Core and Da'an and Zo'or come out of their stupors. Sandoval reports
 on the containment measures at One Taelon Avenue and leaves the Bridge with
 his new weapon. Renee, Liam and Augur watch the funeral coverage and Renee
 announces that Joshua will be elected to run Doors International. Augur
 questions whether Joshua will continue to support the Resistance.

 @{b}Abduction [#65]@{ub}

 On the Mothership, Da'an enters a secret research deck where Dr. Andrea
 Mazar is deciphering Ma'el's logs. Dr. Mazar pulls out a pulse pistol and
 fires at Da'an, leaving him flickering between flesh and energy. Dr. Mazar
 stands over Da'an and a barrage of painful memories of a car accident flood
 her mind. She grabs her laptop computer, Ma'el's logs and heads to the
 portal station. Volunteer Joan Price hands Dr. Mazar a backpack and she
 escapes through the portal as alarms sound.

 Meanwhile, Sandoval convinces Mit'gai to harbor Da'an in the medical lab. Liam
 Kincaid arrives on the mothership and Sandoval refuses to let him visit Da'an.
 Sandoval assigns Liam to find Dr. Mazar and terminate her on sight for the
 attempted murder of Da'an. Later, Liam and Renee Palmer learn that Dr. Mazar
 is a chaos theoretician specializing in quantum mathematics, who boarded the
 mothership over three years ago and never left. Upon questioning Volunteer
 Joan Price, Liam discovers that Dr. Mazar was an orphan and her husband had
 been killed during a Resistance action.

 Later, Zo'or questions Mit'gai about the rigid restrictions placed on Da'an's
 visitors because he wants to interrogate Da'an about Dr. Mazar. Meanwhile, a
 recovered Da'an becomes concerned about locating Dr. Mazar and keeping the
 knowledge of Ma'el's logs from Zo'or. At Augur's lair, Holo-Girl reports to
 Augur, Renee and Liam that Dr. Mazar's real identity is Emma King, the wife of
 successful businessman Philip King. Emma King was kidnapped and supposedly
 killed in a hostage situation for which Sandoval conducted the negotiations.
 Renee decides that Dr. Mazar may have Taelon implanted memories and she
 approaches Philip King as a Doors executive with a business proposition to
 determine if he's working with the Taelons. After her meeting, Renee reports
 to Liam and Augur that King is not a Taelon collaborator. Volunteer Joan Price
 alerts Liam that Portal Authority has traced Dr. Mazar to the Glad Stone Hotel
 in Chicago. Liam arrives at the hotel minutes before Sandoval and convinces
 Dr. Mazar to flee as he downloads her files to Augur. Liam escapes just as
 Sandoval orders the Volunteer Officer to blast the room. The Volunteer reports
 a missed hit and Sandoval orders the city to be sealed off.

 Liam returns to Augur's lair and they determine that Dr. Mazar was
 interpreting a blend of Taelon symbols and Sumerian Hieroglyphs. Liam and
 Augur realize she cannot continue her work without a specific computer and
 they search for her computer source to track her down. Later on the
 mothership, Zo'or bursts into the infirmary and discovers a fully recovered
 Da'an. Zo'or questions Da'an about Dr. Mazar's attack, but Da'an claims to
 have no information. After Zo'or leaves, Da'an calls Sandoval and expresses
 the pressing urgency of locating Dr. Mazar. Meanwhile in an abandoned factory,
 Dr. Mazar receives delivery of a computer and begins to work.

 Later, Augur informs Liam of the computer delivery and portals Liam into Dr.
 Mazar's room just as Sandoval and Volunteers burst through the door. Liam
 returns fire, detonates a smoke grenade, and he and Dr. Mazar escape through
 the portal. Later at Renee's office, Liam and Renee divulge to Dr. Mazar their
 Resistance ties and reveal to her that her true identity is Emma King. They
 also tell her that she has been implanted with fake memories. Emma admits to a
 compelling need to find someone on Earth and Renee tells her that she is
 looking for her husband Philip.

 Meanwhile, Zo'or interrogates Volunteer Joan Price, while Emma completes the
 holographic image in Renee's office. Emma explains that in order to read
 Ma'el's extensive research document, it requires the touch of both a human and
 a Taelon. Renee refuses to share the information with the Taelons but Emma
 informs them after removal from the protective environment of the mothership,
 the relic is degrading and must be read immediately.

 Later, Zo'or informs Liam of the enlightening conversation he had with
 Volunteer Price. Liam confirms finding Emma, terminating her and recovering
 the relic. He agrees to meet with Zo'or at the Taelon Embassy. Together, Liam
 and Zo'or open the document, a primer on the genetic manipulation of the human
 species. They discover humanity to be the missing evolutionary link between
 the Taelons and the Jaridians, and that without humanity both species will
 perish. Zo'or tells Liam that they will work together to discover the
 remaining pieces of information from the document.

 Zo'or confronts Da'an about his exclusion from the research on Ma'el's
 document, ensuring such an omission will never occur again. Zo'or then
 approaches Sandoval about his betrayal, but Sandoval saves himself from
 execution by stating that he is compelled to serve all Companions.
 Meanwhile, Liam and Augur discuss the possibility of Augur replicating
 Zo'or's energy signature to open Ma'el's document and Philip King is
 reunited with his wife, Emma.

 @{b}The Arrival [#66]@{ub}

 Sandoval, Tate and a Black-Ops team await a special landing from ID space when
 the signal is suddenly lost. In the Free Republic of Rostok, Commander Yuri
 Kosygin and a soldier drop into a crater and discover two dead bodies in the
 Taelon shuttle. The soldiers are suddenly thrown by alien blasts and two
 unidentified assailants climb aboard a snowmobile and ride into a curtain of
 fog and snow. At the Taelon Embassy, Liam Kincaid and Da'an receive an
 invitation from Mikael Federov, the leader of the Rostok Republic, to bid on
 the retrieved Taelon craft at a private auction. Liam departs for Rostok and
 Da'an turns to attend to other matters, but stops and finds himself staring at
 his hands, intuitively extending them toward a pair of human hands.

 In Federov's subterranean residence, Liam, Renee Palmer and guests wait for
 the auction to begin. Federov unveils the damaged Taelon shuttle, two alien
 cadavers for medical study and an alien weapon. As the bidding begins,
 Sandoval demands the return of the Taelon property. The Republic of Rostok
 does not recognize the accords Sandoval quotes and the bidders move on to
 watch a weapon demonstration. Sandoval returns to the mothership and replays
 the video of the alien weapon. Zo'or orders Sandoval to make a bid for all the
 items. Sandoval tells Tate to find back channels to deal with Federov directly
 and, with the Power Core from One Taelon Avenue, Sandoval is assured he has
 control over the Taelons and their money.

 Liam, Renee and Augur examine the video of the auction items and spot a
 trail of black dots alongside the snowmobile. They decide a closer look is
 necessary and Renee returns to the Rostok Compound. She plants a decoding
 device to the side of the portal. Renee and Federov leave for dinner and
 Liam enters the secured storage area and discovers a male Jaridian in a
 frozen block of ice. Augur, Liam and Renee discover the shuttle was shot
 down by a Taelon energy cannon. The identity code on the fuselage confirms
 it to be Lili Marquette's shuttle.

 Later, Sandoval meets with Federov to complete the bidding for the auction
 items. Sandoval offers an extra two billion dollars for the two crash
 survivors, provided they are delivered alive by Federov's army. Over a game of
 chess at Federov's residence, Renee agrees to help Federov for ten percent of
 the final bid. Renee suggests Federov go public with the shuttle craft footage
 and inform the public that it was shot down by the Taelons, to increase the
 bidding action. Later, Augur finds human blood in the samples taken from the
 shuttle and discovers that it matches Lili's DNA.

 Meanwhile in a cave, Vorjak, a wounded Jaridian, huddles with the pregnant
 Lili. Vorjak blasts one of Federov's soldiers and they escape aboard his
 snowmobile. Liam and Augur return to the building where Lili was held
 prisoner and scan for DNA. They soon discover Lili's dog tags with the
 message 'Find Me' scratched on them. They return to the lair and Augur
 locates Lili after canvassing the military radio band in Rostok. But amid
 static, he loses her in the roar of gunfire.

 Da'an and Zo'or watch the video transmission of Federov's press conference
 from the mothership and Da'an questions Zo'or's zeal in shooting down the
 craft without establishing contact. When Da'an and Zo'or learn that the craft
 shot down was Lili Marquette's, Zo'or orders Sandoval to resolve negotiations
 with Federov quickly. Da'an once again stares at his outstretched hands and
 contemplates his joining with Lili. Sandoval and his company meet with
 Commander Kosygin and his unit to exchange the gold for Lili and Vorjak, who
 have been captured. Vorjak is released from his bindings and confirms that
 Lili is pregnant. Vorjak believes a hybrid species of human and Jaridian will
 be the answer to Jaridian survival.

 While Da'an reclines in an energy shower, Sandoval releases the Control Core
 and renders Da'an helpless. Meanwhile, Renee forfeits her percentage of the
 gold in exchange for the location of the fugitives. Lili is taken to a
 freighter and hooked up to medical gear as Tate and Vorjak monitor her vital
 signs. Her temperature rises and she convulses. Vorjak tells Tate that Lili
 must receive Taelon energy in order to sustain herself and the fetus.
 Sandoval then wheels in a gurney with an unconscious Da'an. Lili and Da'an
 are hooked up to each other with a matrix of medical equipment and she lifts
 Da'an's palm to her own.

 Meanwhile, Renee and Liam board the ship and begin their search for Lili.
 Suddenly gunfire breaks out on the deck. Renee finds Lili and runs to cover
 her. Sandoval recognizes Renee, but cannot shoot her without injuring Lili,
 Vorjak and Da'an. Sandoval turns to skrill Liam and they each release a blast
 of energy. Sandoval is hit when the energies collide, but he escapes before
 the smoke settles. Liam approaches Lili and discovers she is partially
 transformed into a Jaridian. Scales are visible and Lili has begun the final
 metamorphosis before becoming a Jaridian mother, as she is the only hope to
 save the Jaridian species. Da'an realizes that Taelon energy is needed to save
 the hybrid child and a Taelon must be sacrificed. Liam and Renee try to
 suggest alternatives, but Lili is committed in her joining with Vorjak. She
 rises up and rails against Liam and Renee... who will live and who will die?
