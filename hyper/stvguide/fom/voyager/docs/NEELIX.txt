Neelix
From a part of the galaxy never explored before, Neelix is a male Talaxian. On the U.S.S. Voyager, he serves as guide, cook and self-appointed morale officer. Often times, he designates himself the commentator on the human condition. Neelix is a charming yet scraggly scavenger with wit and noble instincts that have enabled him to survive in this dangerous part of space.
