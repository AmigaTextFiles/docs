Holodeck


The Holographic Environment Simulator, familiarly known as the Holodeck, can 
duplicate with startling reality any environment in the computer's memory.
These simulations are remarkably useful for crew training, recreation, and exercise. 
Since the U.S.S. Voyager is lost in an unfamiliar 
part of the galaxy, many crew members seek refuge from this harsh twist of fate 
in the Holodeck with their memories of what was and fantasies of what's to come.

The crew has attempted to tap the Holodeck's power supply to augment the Voyager's 
dwindling main energy sources. They learned that the power used in the Holodeck 
is incompatible with that required for ship's other operations; therefore, the Holodeck can 
be used for training or recreation as needed without regard to the energy used.
