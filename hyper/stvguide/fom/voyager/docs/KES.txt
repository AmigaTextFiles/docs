Kes

Kes is a female alien from the 
Ocampa-species, a type of alien never before seen 
in the Star Trek universe. She is the delicate, beautiful, young lover of Neelix, 
and although she appears as a 20 year-old in human years, Kes is actually a 
two-year-old Ocampa (a species with a life span of only nine years). She is inquisitive 
and eager to absorb knowledge about the Voyager and her fascinating crew. 
Kes has strange extrasensory powers that have been dormant in her species 
after generations of disuse.
