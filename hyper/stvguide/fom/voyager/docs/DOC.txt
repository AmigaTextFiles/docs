The Doctor

The Doctor is a holographic figure -- an emergency medical program devised by Starfleet. 
When the ship's doctor is killed, he becomes the resident physician 
aboard the U.S.S. Voyager. He is programmed with up-to-date medical 
knowledge and is capable of treating any disease or injury.
