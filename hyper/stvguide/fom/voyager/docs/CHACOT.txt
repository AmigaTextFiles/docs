Chakotay
First Officer


This fearless Captain of the ship agreed to become First Officer of 
the Starship U.S.S. Voyager when his crew joined forces with the Federation. 
Chakotay is a member of the Native American nation that settled on a remote planet 
near the Demilitarized Zone in an effort to preserve their cultural identity. 
He attended Starfleet Academy and became a Lieutenant Commander, and was posted to the 
Merrimac just after the end of the Cardassian Wars. When his people came under 
attack by Cardassians, Chakotay left Starfleet to defend them, joining the 
newly-formed Maquis.


Chakotay continues his practice of traditional rituals aboard Voyager. His 
"spirit guide" - as yet unrevealed - often guides his decision-making process.
