Harry Kim
Operations/Communication Officer


Harry Kim is fresh out of the Starfleet Academy when he is made the 
Operations/Communication Officer of the U.S.S. Voyager. 
Though he enjoyed a stellar academic career and welcomes the challenges 
and adventures of space exploration, Harry is nervous about living up to 
his own expectations.  Being lost so far from home is hardest on Harry, 
who has grown up under the loving shelter of his parents.
