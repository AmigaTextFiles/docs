B'Elanna Torres
Chief Engineer

Torres is the ship's Chief Engineer. Her Klingon mother and human father separated when she was quite young; she was raised by her mother on a remote colony far from the Klingon Homeworld.A former student at Starfleet Academy, B'Elanna quit. 
She is tough, knowledgeable and independent, but her mixed heritage has manifested itself in a state of confusion and denial. Now that B'Elanna is unable to release her frustrations through fighting the Cardassians, she must learn to accept herself and her conflicting heritage.
