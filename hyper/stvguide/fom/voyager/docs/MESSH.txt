Mess Hall

The Mess Hall, located on Deck 2, provides a social atmosphere as well as a 
dining facility for the crew. 
When Kes started producing vegetables in her air garden onboard, Neelix commandeered 
Captain Janeway's private dining room adjacent to the Mess Hall, turning it into a kitchen. 
Appointing himself chief cook, Neelix prepares creative concoctions for the Voyager crew 
which he serves here.
