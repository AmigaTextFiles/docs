Kathryn Janeway
Captain, U.S.S. Voyager

Kathryn Janeway is a Starfleet Captain who leads the combined teams of 
Starfleet and Maquis personnel.  She is a tough Captain, who is not afraid 
to take chances.  While not the only female Captain in Starfleet, her 
intelligence, thoughtfulness, dedication and diplomacy have earned her 
respect and recognition as one of the best Starfleet Captains -- male or female.

The daughter of a mathematician mother and an astrophysicist father, Janeway gained 
experience in various science posts through her early career. She brings a greater 
familiarity with technology and science to her position than any other captain 
we've seen before.
