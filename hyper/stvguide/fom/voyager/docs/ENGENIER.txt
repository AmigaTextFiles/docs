Engineering


Main Engineering, located on Deck 11, is the home of the U.S.S. Voyager's 
warp drive system, more advanced and efficient than that of its predecessors. 
Voyager's folding wing-and-nacelle warp drive system allows the Starship to exceed the 
warp 5 "speed limit," imposed in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "Force of Nature," 
without polluting the space continuum. Voyager can reach a speed 
of warp 9.975, but only for short periods.
