Main Bridge

The command post and braintrust of the U.S.S. Voyager, 
this area serves as the location to view starships in distress or posing threats, 
to negotiate with leaders of rival races, and to learn about the unfamiliar area of 
the galaxy into which the starship has been thrust. The command area at the center of 
the bridge features seating and information displays for the Captain and First Officer.
Captain Kathryn Janeway is in command of this communications hub. Major stations on the 
bridge include Flight Controller, Operations Officer, Security/Tactical, Engineering, Mission 
Operations, and Science.

The Captain's Ready Room and Briefing Center are located directly adjacent to the 
Main Bridge on Deck 1, the uppermost deck of Voyager's Primary Hull.
