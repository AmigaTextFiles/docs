The  original  sources  where  converted into AmigaGuide® by using two Perl
scripts:

    @{"split.pl" LINK split} -- this script  splits  the lexicon entries into one file per
        leading  character.   The  intro part receives the name jarg__, the
        remaining  use  the  last  `_'  to  indicate  which  character they
        contain.   The  appendices  and  the  non-alphabetical entries will
        still have to be separated manually...:\

        Please  note that you'll need @{i}several @{ui}megabytes of free mem to run
        this  script  -  we'll slurp in the whole file, and duplicate it in
        memory  +  perl needs some megabytes itself...:) About 6-7MB should
        be sufficient, though.

    @{"amiguide.pl" LINK amiguide}-- this  script inserts crosslinks and additional markup on
        each part.

Both  scripts  are of course copyright 1996 Jens T.  Berger Thielemann, and
are  released  as  GNUware.  No warranties, of course.  More formally, here

#======= THIS IS THE JARGON FILE, VERSION  3.3.1,  25 JAN 1996 =======#

This is the Jargon File, a comprehensive compendium of hacker slang
illuminating many aspects of hackish tradition, folklore, and humor.

This document (the Jargon File) is in the public domain, to be freely
used, shared, and modified.  There are (by intention) no legal
restraints on what you can do with it, but there are traditions about
its proper use to which many hackers are quite strongly attached.
Please extend the courtesy of proper citation when you quote the File,
ideally with a version number, as it will change and grow over time.
(Examples of appropriate citation form: "Jargon File 3.3.1" or "The
on-line hacker Jargon File, version 3.3.1, 25 JAN 1996".)

The Jargon File is a common heritage of the hacker culture.  Over the
years a number of individuals have volunteered considerable time to
maintaining the File and been recognized by the net at large as
editors of it.  Editorial responsibilities include: to collate
contributions and suggestions from others; to seek out corroborating
information; to cross-reference related entries; to keep the file in a
consistent format; and to announce and distribute updated versions
periodically.  Current volunteer editors include:

        Eric Raymond esr@snark.thyrsus.com (215)-296-5718

Although there is no requirement that you do so, it is considered good
form to check with an editor before quoting the File in a published
work or commercial product.  We may have additional information that
would be helpful to you and can assist you in framing your quote to
reflect not only the letter of the File but its spirit as well.

All contributions and suggestions about this file sent to a volunteer
editor are gratefully received and will be regarded, unless otherwise
labelled, as freely given donations for possible use as part of this
public-domain file.

From time to time a snapshot of this file has been polished, edited,
and formatted for commercial publication with the cooperation of the
volunteer editors and the hacker community at large.  If you wish to
have a bound paper copy of this file, you may find it convenient to
purchase one of these.  They often contain additional material not
found in on-line versions.  The two `authorized' editions so far are
described in the Revision History section; there may be more in the
future.

@{b}Introduction@{ub}
**************

This document is a collection of slang terms used by various
subcultures of computer hackers.  Though some technical material is
included for background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary;
what we describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for
fun, social communication, and technical debate.

The `hacker culture' is actually a loosely networked collection of
subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared
experiences, shared roots, and shared values.  It has its own myths,
heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams.  Because
hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define
themselves partly by rejection of `normal' values and working habits,
it has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional
culture less than 40 years old.

As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold
their culture together -- it helps hackers recognize each other's
places in the community and expresses shared values and experiences.
Also as usual, *not* knowing the slang (or using it inappropriately)
defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of all in hackish
vocabulary) possibly even a @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}.  All human cultures use slang in
this threefold way -- as a tool of communication, and of inclusion,
and of exclusion.

Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps
in the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard
to detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are
code for shared states of *consciousness*.  There is a whole range of
altered states and problem-solving mental stances basic to high-level
hacking which don't fit into conventional linguistic reality any
better than a Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's `trompe l'oeil'
compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and hacker slang
encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways.  As a simple example,
take the distinction between a @{"kluge" LINK "jarg_K" 155} and an @{"elegant" LINK "jarg_E" 108} solution, and
the differing connotations attached to each.  The distinction is not
only of engineering significance; it reaches right back into the
nature of the generative processes in program design and asserts
something important about two different kinds of relationship between
the hacker and the hack.  Hacker slang is unusually rich in
implications of this kind, of overtones and undertones that illuminate
the hackish psyche.

But there is more.  Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very
conscious and inventive in their use of language.  These traits seem
to be common in young children, but the conformity-enforcing machine
we are pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of
most of us before adolescence.  Thus, linguistic invention in most
subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious
process.  Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a
game to be played for conscious pleasure.  Their inventions thus
display an almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of
language-play with the discrimination of educated and powerful
intelligence.  Further, the electronic media which knit them together
are fluid, `hot' connections, well adapted to both the dissemination
of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and superannuated
specimens.  The results of this process give us perhaps a uniquely
intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action.

Hackish slang also challenges some common linguistic and
anthropological assumptions.  For example, it has recently become
fashionable to speak of `low-context' versus `high-context'
communication, and to classify cultures by the preferred context level
of their languages and art forms.  It is usually claimed that
low-context communication (characterized by precision, clarity, and
completeness of self-contained utterances) is typical in cultures
which value logic, objectivity, individualism, and competition; by
contrast, high-context communication (elliptical, emotive,
nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is associated with cultures
which value subjectivity, consensus, cooperation, and tradition.  What
then are we to make of hackerdom, which is themed around extremely
low-context interaction with computers and exhibits primarily
"low-context" values, but cultivates an almost absurdly high-context
slang style?

The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a
compilation of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the
surrounding culture -- and, in fact, this one is the latest version of
an evolving compilation called the `Jargon File', maintained by
hackers themselves for over 15 years.  This one (like its ancestors)
is primarily a lexicon, but also includes `topic entries' which
collect background or sidelight information on hacker culture that
would be awkward to try to subsume under individual entries.

Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that
the material be enjoyable to browse.  Even a complete outsider should
find at least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is
amusingly thought-provoking.  But it is also true that hackers use
humorous wordplay to make strong, sometimes combative statements about
what they feel.  Some of these entries reflect the views of opposing
sides in disputes that have been genuinely passionate; this is
deliberate.  We have not tried to moderate or pretty up these
disputes; rather we have attempted to ensure that *everyone's* sacred
cows get gored, impartially.  Compromise is not particularly a hackish
virtue, but the honest presentation of divergent viewpoints is.

The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references
incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them.  We have not felt
it either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,
contribute flavor, and one of this document's major intended audiences
--- fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture -- will benefit
from them.

A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included
in Appendix A, @{"Hacker Folklore" LINK "jarg_app" 1}. The `outside' reader's attention is
particularly directed to Appendix B, @{"A Portrait of J. Random Hacker" LINK "jarg_app" 728}.
Appendix C, the @{"Bibliography" LINK "jarg_app" 1109}, lists some non-technical works which
have either influenced or described the hacker culture.

Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must
choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line
between description and influence can become more than a little
blurred.  Earlier versions of the Jargon File have played a central
role in spreading hacker language and the culture that goes with it to
successively larger populations, and we hope and expect that this one
will do likewise.

@{b}Of Slang, Jargon, and Techspeak@{ub}
=================================

Linguists usually refer to informal language as `slang' and reserve
the term `jargon' for the technical vocabularies of various
occupations.  However, the ancestor of this collection was called the
`Jargon File', and hackish slang is traditionally `the jargon'.  When
talking about the jargon there is therefore no convenient way to
distinguish it from what a *linguist* would call hackers' jargon
--- the formal vocabulary they learn from textbooks, technical papers,
and manuals.

To make a confused situation worse, the line between hackish slang and
the vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy,
and shifts over time.  Further, this vocabulary is shared with a wider
technical culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do
not speak or recognize hackish slang.

Accordingly, this lexicon will try to be as precise as the facts of
usage permit about the distinctions among three categories:

   * `slang': informal language from mainstream English or
     non-technical subcultures (bikers, rock fans, surfers, etc).

   * `jargon': without qualifier, denotes informal `slangy' language
     peculiar to or predominantly found among hackers -- the subject
     of this lexicon.

   * `techspeak': the formal technical vocabulary of programming,
     computer science, electronics, and other fields connected to
     hacking.

This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder of
this lexicon.

The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one.  A lot of
techspeak originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing
uptake of jargon into techspeak.  On the other hand, a lot of jargon
arises from overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about
this in the @{"Jargon Construction" LINK "jarg_%" 500} section below).

In general, we have considered techspeak any term that communicates
primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks, technical
dictionaries, or standards documents.

A few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems,
languages, or documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker
folklore that isn't covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey
critical historical background necessary to understand other entries
to which they are cross-referenced.  Some other techspeak senses of
jargon words are listed in order to make the jargon senses clear;
where the text does not specify that a straight technical sense is
under discussion, these are marked with `[techspeak]' as an etymology.
Some entries have a primary sense marked this way, with subsequent
jargon meanings explained in terms of it.

We have also tried to indicate (where known) the apparent origins of
terms.  The results are probably the least reliable information in the
lexicon, for several reasons.  For one thing, it is well known that
many hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple times,
even among the more obscure and intricate neologisms.  It often seems
that the generative processes underlying hackish jargon formation have
an internal logic so powerful as to create substantial parallelism
across separate cultures and even in different languages!  For
another, the networks tend to propagate innovations so quickly that
`first use' is often impossible to pin down.  And, finally, compendia
like this one alter what they observe by implicitly stamping cultural
approval on terms and widening their use.

Despite these problems, the organized collection of jargon-related
oral history for the new compilations has enabled us to put to rest
quite a number of folk etymologies, place credit where credit is due,
and illuminate the early history of many important hackerisms such as
@{"kluge" LINK "jarg_K" 155}, @{"cruft" LINK "jarg_C" 1508}, and @{"foo" LINK "jarg_F" 825}.  We believe specialist lexicographers
will find many of the historical notes more than casually instructive.

@{b}Revision History@{ub}
==================

The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from
technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab
(SAIL), and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities
including Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University
(CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as `jargon-1' or `the File')
was begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975.  From this time until
the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the File was
named AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] there.  Some terms in it date back
considerably earlier (@{"frob" LINK "jarg_F" 1170} and some senses of @{"moby" LINK "jarg_M" 780}, for instance,
go back to the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and are believed to
date at least back to the early 1960s).  The revisions of jargon-1
were all unnumbered and may be collectively considered `Version 1'.

In 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on
the SAIL computer, @{"FTP" LINK "jarg_F" 1285}ed a copy of the File to MIT.  He noticed that
it was hardly restricted to `AI words' and so stored the file on his
directory as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON.

The file was quickly renamed JARGON > (the `>' caused versioning under
ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin and Guy L.
Steele Jr.  Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody thought of
correcting the term `jargon' to `slang' until the compendium had
already become widely known as the Jargon File.

Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter
and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was
subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic
resynchronizations).

The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard
Stallman was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and
ITS-related coinages.

In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of
the File published in Stewart Brand's "CoEvolution Quarterly" (issue
29, pages 26--35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele
(including a couple of the Crunchly cartoons).  This appears to have
been the File's first paper publication.

A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass
market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as "The
Hacker's Dictionary" (Harper & Row CN 1082, ISBN 0-06-091082-8).  The
other jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and Mark Crispin)
contributed to this revision, as did Richard M. Stallman and Geoff
Goodfellow.  This book (now out of print) is hereafter referred to as
`Steele-1983' and those six as the Steele-1983 coauthors.

Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively
stopped growing and changing.  Originally, this was due to a desire to
freeze the file temporarily to facilitate the production of
Steele-1983, but external conditions caused the `temporary' freeze to
become permanent.

The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts
and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported
hardware and software instead of homebrew whenever possible.  At MIT,
most AI work had turned to dedicated LISP Machines.  At the same time,
the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best
and brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in
Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley.  The startups built LISP
machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a @{"TWENEX" LINK "jarg_T" 1189} system
rather than a host for the AI hackers' beloved @{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463}.

The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although
the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource
until 1991.  Stanford became a major @{"TWENEX" LINK "jarg_T" 1189} site, at one point
operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the mid-1980s most
of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD
Unix standard.

In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the
File were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter
project at Digital Equipment Corporation.  The File's compilers,
already dispersed, moved on to other things.  Steele-1983 was partly a
monument to what its authors thought was a dying tradition; no one
involved realized at the time just how wide its influence was to be.

By the mid-1980s the File's content was dated, but the legend that had
grown up around it never quite died out.  The book, and softcopies
obtained off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures far removed from
MIT and Stanford; the content exerted a strong and continuing
influence on hackish language and humor.  Even as the advent of the
microcomputer and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of
hackerdom, the File (and related materials such as the @{"AI Koans" LINK "jarg_app" 353} in
Appendix A) came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture
Matter of Britain chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of
the Lab.  The pace of change in hackerdom at large accelerated
tremendously -- but the Jargon File, having passed from living
document to icon, remained essentially untouched for seven years.

This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of
jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after
careful consultation with the editors of Steele-1983).  It merges in
about 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and
a very few entries introduced in Steele-1983 that are now also
obsolete.

This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim
is to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all the technical
computing cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested.  More
than half of the entries now derive from @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190} and represent jargon
now current in the C and Unix communities, but special efforts have
been made to collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC
programmers, Amiga fans, Mac enthusiasts, and even the IBM mainframe
world.

Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> maintains the new File with
assistance from Guy L. Steele Jr. <gls@think.com>; these are the
persons primarily reflected in the File's editorial `we', though we
take pleasure in acknowledging the special contribution of the other
coauthors of Steele-1983.  Please email all additions, corrections,

The 2.9.6 version became the main text of "The New Hacker's
Dictionary", by Eric Raymond (ed.), MIT Press 1991, ISBN
0-262-68069-6.

The 3.0.0 version was published in September 1993 as the second
edition of "The New Hacker's Dictionary", again from MIT Press (ISBN
0-262-18154-1).

The maintainers are committed to updating the on-line version of the
Jargon File through and beyond paper publication, and will continue to
make it available to archives and public-access sites as a trust of
the hacker community.

Here is a chronology of the high points in the recent on-line
revisions:

Version numbering: Version numbers should be read as
major.minor.revision.  Major version 1 is reserved for the `old' (ITS)
Jargon File, jargon-1.  Major version 2 encompasses revisions by ESR
(Eric S. Raymond) with assistance from GLS (Guy L.  Steele, Jr.)
leading up to and including the second paper edition.  From now on,
major version number N.00 will probably correspond to the Nth paper
edition.  Usually later versions will either completely supersede or
incorporate earlier versions, so there is generally no point in
keeping old versions around.

Our thanks to the coauthors of Steele-1983 for oversight and
assistance, and to the hundreds of Usenetters (too many to name here)
who contributed entries and encouragement.  More thanks go to several
of the old-timers on the Usenet group alt.folklore.computers, who
contributed much useful commentary and many corrections and valuable
historical perspective: Joseph M. Newcomer <jn11+@andrew.cmu.edu>,
Bernie Cosell <cosell@bbn.com>, Earl Boebert <boebert@SCTC.com>, and
Joe Morris <jcmorris@mwunix.mitre.org>.

We were fortunate enough to have the aid of some accomplished
linguists.  David Stampe <stampe@hawaii.edu> and Charles Hoequist
<hoequist@bnr.ca> contributed valuable criticism; Joe Keane
<jgk@osc.osc.com> helped us improve the pronunciation guides.

A few bits of this text quote previous works.  We are indebted to
Brian A. LaMacchia <bal@zurich.ai.mit.edu> for obtaining permission
for us to use material from the "TMRC Dictionary"; also, Don Libes
<libes@cme.nist.gov> contributed some appropriate material from his
excellent book "Life With UNIX".  We thank Per Lindberg
<per@front.se>, author of the remarkable Swedish-language 'zine
"Hackerbladet", for bringing "FOO!" comics to our attention and
smuggling one of the IBM hacker underground's own baby jargon files
out to us.  Thanks also to Maarten Litmaath for generously allowing
the inclusion of the ASCII pronunciation guide he formerly maintained.
And our gratitude to Marc Weiser of XEROX PARC
<Marc_Weiser.PARC@xerox.com> for securing us permission to quote from
PARC's own jargon lexicon and shipping us a copy.

It is a particular pleasure to acknowledge the major contributions of
Mark Brader <msb@sq.com> and Steve Summit <scs@eskimo.com> to the File
and Dictionary; they have read and reread many drafts, checked facts,
caught typos, submitted an amazing number of thoughtful comments, and
done yeoman service in catching typos and minor usage bobbles.  Their
rare combination of enthusiasm, persistence, wide-ranging technical
knowledge, and precisionism in matters of language has been of
invaluable help.  Indeed, the sustained volume and quality of
Mr. Brader's input over several years and several different editions
has only allowed him to escape co-editor credit by the slimmest of
margins.

Finally, George V. Reilly <georgere@microsoft.com> helped with TeX
arcana and painstakingly proofread some 2.7 and 2.8 versions, and Eric
Tiedemann <est@thyrsus.com> contributed sage advice throughout on
rhetoric, amphigory, and philosophunculism.

@{b}How Jargon Works@{ub}
******************

@{b}Jargon Construction@{ub}
=====================

There are some standard methods of jargonification that became
established quite early (i.e., before 1970), spreading from such
sources as the Tech Model Railroad Club, the PDP-1 SPACEWAR hackers,
and John McCarthy's original crew of LISPers.  These include verb
doubling, soundalike slang, the `-P' convention, overgeneralization,
spoken inarticulations, and anthromorphization.  Each is discussed
below.  We also cover the standard comparatives for design quality.

Of these six, verb doubling, overgeneralization, anthromorphization,
and (especially) spoken inarticulations have become quite general; but
soundalike slang is still largely confined to MIT and other large
universities, and the `-P' convention is found only where LISPers
flourish.

@{b}Verb Doubling@{ub}
---------------

A standard construction in English is to double a verb and use it as
an exclamation, such as "Bang, bang!" or "Quack, quack!".  Most of
these are names for noises.  Hackers also double verbs as a concise,
sometimes sarcastic comment on what the implied subject does.  Also, a
doubled verb is often used to terminate a conversation, in the process
remarking on the current state of affairs or what the speaker intends
to do next.  Typical examples involve @{"win" LINK "jarg_W" 493}, @{"lose" LINK "jarg_L" 549}, @{"hack" LINK "jarg_H" 28}, @{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600},
@{"barf" LINK "jarg_B" 294}, @{"chomp" LINK "jarg_C" 455}:

     "The disk heads just crashed."  "Lose, lose."
     "Mostly he talked about his latest crock.  Flame, flame."
     "Boy, what a bagbiter!  Chomp, chomp!"

Some verb-doubled constructions have special meanings not immediately
obvious from the verb.  These have their own listings in the lexicon.

The @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190} culture has one *tripling* convention unrelated to this;
the names of `joke' topic groups often have a tripled last element.
The first and paradigmatic example was alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork
(a "Muppet Show" reference); other infamous examples have included:

     alt.french.captain.borg.borg.borg
     alt.wesley.crusher.die.die.die
     comp.unix.internals.system.calls.brk.brk.brk
     sci.physics.edward.teller.boom.boom.boom
     alt.sadistic.dentists.drill.drill.drill

@{b}Soundalike slang@{ub}
------------------

Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to convert an ordinary
word or phrase into something more interesting.  It is considered
particularly @{"flavorful" LINK "jarg_F" 707} if the phrase is bent so as to include some
other jargon word; thus the computer hobbyist magazine "Dr. Dobb's
Journal" is almost always referred to among hackers as `Dr. Frob's
Journal' or simply `Dr. Frob's'.  Terms of this kind that have been in
fairly wide use include names for newspapers:

         Boston Herald => Horrid (or Harried)
         Boston Globe => Boston Glob
         Houston (or San Francisco) Chronicle
                => the Crocknicle (or the Comical)
         New York Times => New York Slime

However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment.
Standard examples include:

         Data General => Dirty Genitals
         IBM 360 => IBM Three-Sickly
         Government Property -- Do Not Duplicate (on keys)
                 => Government Duplicity -- Do Not Propagate
         for historical reasons => for hysterical raisins
         Margaret Jacks Hall (the CS building at Stanford)
                 => Marginal Hacks Hall

This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been
compared to in the past, because Cockney substitutions are opaque
whereas hacker punning jargon is intentionally transparent.

@{b}The `-P' convention@{ub}
---------------------

Turning a word into a question by appending the syllable `P'; from the
LISP convention of appending the letter `P' to denote a predicate (a
boolean-valued function).  The question should expect a yes/no answer,
though it needn't.  (See @{"T" LINK "jarg_T" 1} and @{"NIL" LINK "jarg_N" 464}.)

         At dinnertime:
               Q: "Foodp?"
               A: "Yeah, I'm pretty hungry." or "T!"

         At any time:
               Q: "State-of-the-world-P?"
               A: (Straight) "I'm about to go home."
               A: (Humorous) "Yes, the world has a state."

         On the phone to Florida:
               Q: "State-p Florida?"
               A: "Been reading JARGON.TXT again, eh?"

[One of the best of these is a @{"Gosperism" LINK "jarg_G" 545}.  Once, when we were at a
Chinese restaurant, Bill Gosper wanted to know whether someone would
like to share with him a two-person-sized bowl of soup.  His inquiry
was: "Split-p soup?" -- GLS]

@{b}Overgeneralization@{ub}
--------------------

A very conspicuous feature of jargon is the frequency with which
techspeak items such as names of program tools, command language
primitives, and even assembler opcodes are applied to contexts outside
of computing wherever hackers find amusing analogies to them.  Thus
(to cite one of the best-known examples) Unix hackers often @{"grep" LINK "jarg_G" 704} for
things rather than searching for them.  Many of the lexicon entries
are generalizations of exactly this kind.

Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well.
Many hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to
them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to
nonuniform cases (or vice versa).  For example, because

     porous => porosity
     generous => generosity

hackers happily generalize:

     mysterious => mysteriosity
     ferrous => ferrosity
     obvious => obviosity
     dubious => dubiosity

Another class of common construction uses the suffix `-itude' to
abstract a quality from just about any adjective or noun.  This usage
arises especially in cases where mainstream English would perform the
same abstraction through `-iness' or `-ingness'.  Thus:

     win => winnitude (a common exclamation)
     loss => lossitude
     cruft => cruftitude
     lame => lameitude

Some hackers cheerfully reverse this transformation; they argue, for
example, that the horizontal degree lines on a globe ought to be
called `lats' -- after all, they're measuring latitude!

Also, note that all nouns can be verbed.  E.g.: "All nouns can be
verbed", "I'll mouse it up", "Hang on while I clipboard it over", "I'm
grepping the files".  English as a whole is already heading in this
direction (towards pure-positional grammar like Chinese); hackers are
simply a bit ahead of the curve.

However, hackers avoid the unimaginative verb-making techniques
characteristic of marketroids, bean-counters, and the Pentagon; a
hacker would never, for example, `productize', `prioritize', or
`securitize' things.  Hackers have a strong aversion to bureaucratic
bafflegab and regard those who use it with contempt.

Similarly, all verbs can be nouned.  This is only a slight
overgeneralization in modern English; in hackish, however, it is good
form to mark them in some standard nonstandard way.  Thus:

     win => winnitude, winnage
     disgust => disgustitude
     hack => hackification

Further, note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural
forms.  Some of these go back quite a ways; the TMRC Dictionary
includes an entry which implies that the plural of `mouse' is
@{"meeces" LINK "jarg_M" 385}, and notes that the defined plural of `caboose' is `cabeese'.
This latter has apparently been standard (or at least a standard joke)
among railfans (railroad enthusiasts) for many years.

On a similarly Anglo-Saxon note, almost anything ending in `x' may
form plurals in `-xen' (see @{"VAXen" LINK "jarg_V" 97} and @{"boxen" LINK "jarg_B" 1600} in the main text).
Even words ending in phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes treated this
way; e.g., `soxen' for a bunch of socks.  Other funny plurals are
`frobbotzim' for the plural of `frobbozz' (see @{"frobnitz" LINK "jarg_F" 1200}) and
`Unices' and `Twenices' (rather than `Unixes' and `Twenexes'; see
@{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54}, @{"TWENEX" LINK "jarg_T" 1189} in main text).  But note that `Unixen' and `Twenexen'
are never used; it has been suggested that this is because `-ix' and
`-ex' are Latin singular endings that attract a Latinate plural.
Finally, it has been suggested to general approval that the plural of
`mongoose' ought to be `polygoose'.

The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is
generalization of an inflectional rule that in English is either an
import or a fossil (such as the Hebrew plural ending `-im', or the
Anglo-Saxon plural suffix `-en') to cases where it isn't normally
considered to apply.

This is not `poor grammar', as hackers are generally quite well aware
of what they are doing when they distort the language.  It is
grammatical creativity, a form of playfulness.  It is done not to
impress but to amuse, and never at the expense of clarity.

@{b}Spoken inarticulations@{ub}
------------------------

Words such as `mumble', `sigh', and `groan' are spoken in places where
their referent might more naturally be used.  It has been suggested
that this usage derives from the impossibility of representing such
noises on a comm link or in electronic mail (interestingly, the same
sorts of constructions have been showing up with increasing frequency
in comic strips).  Another expression sometimes heard is "Complain!",
meaning "I have a complaint!"

@{b}Anthromorphization@{ub}
--------------------

Semantically, one rich source of jargon constructions is the hackish
tendency to anthropomorphize hardware and software.  This isn't done
in a naive way; hackers don't personalize their stuff in the sense of
feeling empathy with it, nor do they mystically believe that the
things they work on every day are `alive'.  What *is* common is to
hear hardware or software talked about as though it has homunculi
talking to each other inside it, with intentions and desires.  Thus,
one hears "The protocol handler got confused", or that programs "are
trying" to do things, or one may say of a routine that "its goal in
life is to X".  One even hears explanations like "...  and its poor
little brain couldn't understand X, and it died."  Sometimes modelling
things this way actually seems to make them easier to understand,
perhaps because it's instinctively natural to think of anything with a
really complex behavioral repertoire as `like a person' rather than
`like a thing'.

@{b}Comparatives@{ub}
--------------

Finally, note that many words in hacker jargon have to be understood
as members of sets of comparatives.  This is especially true of the
adjectives and nouns used to describe the beauty and functional
quality of code.  Here is an approximately correct spectrum:

     monstrosity  brain-damage  screw  bug  lose  misfeature
     crock  kluge  hack  win  feature  elegance  perfection

The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute, approximated but never
actually attained.  Another similar scale is used for describing the
reliability of software:

     broken  flaky  dodgy  fragile  brittle
     solid  robust  bulletproof  armor-plated

Note, however, that `dodgy' is primarily Commonwealth Hackish (it is
rare in the U.S.) and may change places with `flaky' for some
speakers.

Coinages for describing @{"lossage" LINK "jarg_L" 580} seem to call forth the very finest
in hackish linguistic inventiveness; it has been truly said that
hackers have even more words for equipment failures than Yiddish has
for obnoxious people.

@{b}Hacker Writing Style@{ub}
======================

We've already seen that hackers often coin jargon by overgeneralizing
grammatical rules.  This is one aspect of a more general fondness for
form-versus-content language jokes that shows up particularly in
hackish writing.  One correspondent reports that he consistently
misspells `wrong' as `worng'.  Others have been known to criticize
glitches in Jargon File drafts by observing (in the mode of Douglas
Hofstadter) "This sentence no verb", or "Too repetetetive", or "Bad
speling", or "Incorrectspa cing."  Similarly, intentional spoonerisms
are often made of phrases relating to confusion or things that are
confusing; `dain bramage' for `brain damage' is perhaps the most
common (similarly, a hacker would be likely to write "Excuse me, I'm
cixelsyd today", rather than "I'm dyslexic today").  This sort of
thing is quite common and is enjoyed by all concerned.

Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses,
much to the dismay of American editors.  Thus, if "Jim is going" is a
phrase, and so are "Bill runs" and "Spock groks", then hackers
generally prefer to write: "Jim is going", "Bill runs", and "Spock
groks".  This is incorrect according to standard American usage (which
would put the continuation commas and the final period inside the
string quotes); however, it is counter-intuitive to hackers to
mutilate literal strings with characters that don't belong in them.
Given the sorts of examples that can come up in discussions of
programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading.
When communicating command lines or small pieces of code, extra
characters can be a real pain in the neck.

Consider, for example, a sentence in a @{"vi" LINK "jarg_V" 248} tutorial that looks like
this:

     Then delete a line from the file by typing "dd".

Standard usage would make this

     Then delete a line from the file by typing "dd."

but that would be very bad -- because the reader would be prone to
type the string d-d-dot, and it happens that in `vi(1)' dot
repeats the last command accepted.  The net result would be to delete
*two* lines! 

The Jargon File follows hackish usage throughout.

Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great
Britain, though the older style (which became established for
typographical reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and
quotes in typeset text) is still accepted there.  "Hart's Rules" and
the "Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors" call the hacker-like
style `new' or `logical' quoting.

Another hacker habit is a tendency to distinguish between `scare'
quotes and `speech' quotes; that is, to use British-style single
quotes for marking and reserve American-style double quotes for actual
reports of speech or text included from elsewhere.  Interestingly,
some authorities describe this as correct general usage, but
mainstream American English has gone to using double-quotes
indiscriminately enough that hacker usage appears marked [and, in
fact, I thought this was a personal quirk of mine until I checked with
Usenet -- ESR].  One further permutation that is definitely
*not* standard is a hackish tendency to do marking quotes by
using apostrophes (single quotes) in pairs; that is, 'like this'.
This is modelled on string and character literal syntax in some
programming languages (reinforced by the fact that many character-only
terminals display the apostrophe in typewriter style, as a vertical
single quote).

One quirk that shows up frequently in the @{"email" LINK "jarg_E" 211} style of Unix
hackers in particular is a tendency for some things that are normally
all-lowercase (including usernames and the names of commands and C
routines) to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the
beginning of sentences.  It is clear that, for many hackers, the case
of such identifiers becomes a part of their internal representation
(the `spelling') and cannot be overridden without mental effort (an
appropriate reflex because Unix and C both distinguish cases and
confusing them can lead to @{"lossage" LINK "jarg_L" 580}).  A way of escaping this dilemma
is simply to avoid using these constructions at the beginning of
sentences.

There seems to be a meta-rule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to
the effect that precision of expression is more important than
conformance to traditional rules; where the latter create ambiguity or
lose information they can be discarded without a second thought.  It
is notable in this respect that other hackish inventions (for example,
in vocabulary) also tend to carry very precise shades of meaning even
when constructed to appear slangy and loose.  In fact, to a hacker,
the contrast between `loose' form and `tight' content in jargon is a
substantial part of its humor!

Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis
conventions adapted to single-font all-ASCII communications links, and
these are occasionally carried over into written documents even when
normal means of font changes, underlining, and the like are available.

One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS `LOUD', and
this becomes such an ingrained synesthetic reflex that a person who
goes to caps-lock while in @{"talk mode" LINK "jarg_T" 19} may be asked to "stop shouting,
please, you're hurting my ears!".

Also, it is common to use bracketing with unusual characters to
signify emphasis.  The asterisk is most common, as in "What the
*hell*?" even though this interferes with the common use of the
asterisk suffix as a footnote mark.  The underscore is also common,
suggesting underlining (this is particularly common with book titles;
for example, "It is often alleged that Joe Haldeman wrote
_The_Forever_War_ as a rebuttal to Robert Heinlein's earlier novel of
the future military, _Starship_Troopers_.").  Other forms exemplified
by "=hell=", "\hell/", or "/hell/" are occasionally seen (it's claimed
that in the last example the first slash pushes the letters over to
the right to make them italic, and the second keeps them from falling
over).  Finally, words may also be emphasized L I K E T H I S, or by a
series of carets (^) under them on the next line of the text.

There is a semantic difference between *emphasis like this* (which
emphasizes the phrase as a whole), and *emphasis* *like* *this* (which
suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if to a
very young child or a mentally impaired person).  Bracketing a word
with the `*' character may also indicate that the writer wishes
readers to consider that an action is taking place or that a sound is
being made.  Examples: *bang*, *hic*, *ring*, *grin*, *kick*, *stomp*,
*mumble*.

One might also see the above sound effects as <bang>, <hic>, <ring>,
<grin>, <kick>, <stomp>, <mumble>.  This use of angle brackets to mark
their contents originally derives from conventions used in @{"BNF" LINK "jarg_B" 1225}.  but
since about 1993 it has been reinforced by the HTML markup used on the
World Wide Web.

Angle-bracket enclosure is also used to indicate that a term stands
for some @{"random" LINK "jarg_R" 26} member of a larger class (this is straight from
@{"BNF" LINK "jarg_B" 1225}). Examples like the following are common:

     So this <ethnic> walks into a bar one day...

There is also an accepted convention for `writing under erasure'; the
text

     Be nice to this fool^H^H^H^Hgentleman,
     he's visiting from corporate HQ.

reads roughly as "Be nice to this fool, er, gentleman...".  This comes
from the fact that the digraph ^H is often used as a print
representation for a backspace.  It parallels (and may have been
influenced by) the ironic use of `slashouts' in science-fiction
fanzines.

A related habit uses editor commands to signify corrections to
previous text.  This custom is fading as more mailers get good editing
capabilities, but one occasionally still sees things like this:

     I've seen that term used on alt.foobar often. 
     Send it to Erik for the File.  Oops...s/Erik/Eric/.

The s/Erik/Eric/ says "change Erik to Eric in the preceding".  This
syntax is borrowed from the Unix editing tools `ed' and `sed', but is
widely recognized by non-Unix hackers as well.

In a formula, `*' signifies multiplication but two asterisks in a row
are a shorthand for exponentiation (this derives from FORTRAN).  Thus,
one might write 2 ** 8 = 256.

Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the
caret (^, ASCII 1011110); one might write instead `2^8 = 256'.  This
goes all the way back to Algol-60, which used the archaic ASCII
`up-arrow' that later became the caret; this was picked up by Kemeny
and Kurtz's original BASIC, which in turn influenced the design of the
`bc(1)' and `dc(1)' Unix tools, which have probably done most to
reinforce the convention on Usenet.  The notation is mildly confusing
to C programmers, because `^' means bitwise exclusive-or in C.
Despite this, it was favored 3:1 over ** in a late-1990 snapshot of
Usenet.  It is used consistently in this lexicon.

In on-line exchanges, hackers tend to use decimal forms or improper
fractions (`3.5' or `7/2') rather than `typewriter style' mixed
fractions (`3-1/2').  The major motive here is probably that the
former are more readable in a monospaced font, together with a desire
to avoid the risk that the latter might be read as `three minus
one-half'.  The decimal form is definitely preferred for fractions
with a terminating decimal representation; there may be some cultural
influence here from the high status of scientific notation.

Another on-line convention, used especially for very large or very
small numbers, is taken from C (which derived it from FORTRAN).  This
is a form of `scientific notation' using `e' to replace `*10^'; for
example, one year is about 3e7 seconds long.

The tilde (~) is commonly used in a quantifying sense of
`approximately'; that is, `~50' means `about fifty'.

On Usenet and in the @{"MUD" LINK "jarg_M" 1065} world, common C boolean, logical, and
relational operators such as `|', `&', `||', `&&', `!', `==', `!=',
`>', `<', `>=', and `=<' are often combined with English.  The Pascal
not-equals, `<>', is also recognized, and occasionally one sees `/='
for not-equals (from Ada, Common Lisp, and Fortran 90).  The use of
prefix `!' as a loose synonym for `not-' or `no-' is particularly
common; thus, `!clue' is read `no-clue' or `clueless'.

A related practice borrows syntax from preferred programming languages
to express ideas in a natural-language text.  For example, one might
see the following:

     In <jrh578689@thudpucker.com> J. R. Hacker wrote:
     >I recently had occasion to field-test the Snafu
     >Systems 2300E adaptive gonkulator.  The price was

     Yeah, I tried one out too.

     #ifdef FLAME
     Hasn't anyone told those idiots that you can't get
     decent bogon suppression with AFJ filters at today's
     net volumes?
     #endif /* FLAME */

     I guess they figured the price premium for true
     frame-based semantic analysis was too high.
     Unfortunately, it's also the only workable approach.
     I wouldn't recommend purchase of this product unless
     you're on a *very* tight budget.

     #include <disclaimer.h>
     --
                      == Frank Foonly (Fubarco Systems)

In the above, the `#ifdef'/`#endif' pair is a conditional compilation
syntax from C; here, it implies that the text between (which is a
@{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600}) should be evaluated only if you have turned on (or defined
on) the switch FLAME.  The `#include' at the end is C for "include
standard disclaimer here"; the `standard disclaimer' is understood to
read, roughly, "These are my personal opinions and not to be construed
as the official position of my employer."

The top section in the example, with > at the left margin, is an
example of an inclusion convention we'll discuss below.

More recently, following on the huge popularity of the World Wide Web,
pseudo-HTML markup has become popular for similar purposes:

     <flame>
     The flame goes here.
     </flame>

You'll even see this with an HTML-style modifier:

     <flame intensity=100%>
     This is an extremely hot flame.
     </flame>


Hackers also mix letters and numbers more freely than in mainstream
usage.  In particular, it is good hackish style to write a digit
sequence where you intend the reader to understand the text string
that names that number in English.  So, hackers prefer to write
`1970s' rather than `nineteen-seventies' or `1970's' (the latter looks
like a possessive).

It should also be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to
use multiply nested parentheses than is normal in English.  Part of
this is almost certainly due to influence from LISP (which uses deeply
nested parentheses (like this (see?)) in its syntax a lot), but it has
also been suggested that a more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing
with complexity and pushing systems to their limits is in operation.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that many studies of on-line
communication have shown that electronic links have a de-inhibiting
effect on people.  Deprived of the body-language cues through which
emotional state is expressed, people tend to forget everything about
other parties except what is presented over that ASCII link.  This has
both good and bad effects.  A good one is that it encourages honesty
and tends to break down hierarchical authority relationships; a bad
one is that it may encourage depersonalization and gratuitous
rudeness.  Perhaps in response to this, experienced netters often
display a sort of conscious formal politesse in their writing that has
passed out of fashion in other spoken and written media (for example,
the phrase "Well said, sir!" is not uncommon).

Many introverted hackers who are next to inarticulate in person
communicate with considerable fluency over the net, perhaps precisely
because they can forget on an unconscious level that they are dealing
with people and thus don't feel stressed and anxious as they would
face to face.

Though it is considered gauche to publicly criticize posters for poor
spelling or grammar, the network places a premium on literacy and
clarity of expression.  It may well be that future historians of
literature will see in it a revival of the great tradition of personal
letters as art.

@{b}Email Quotes and Inclusion Conventions@{ub}
========================================

One area where hackish conventions for on-line writing are still in
some flux is the marking of included material from earlier messages
--- what would be called `block quotations' in ordinary English.  From
the usual typographic convention employed for these (smaller font at
an extra indent), there derived the notation of included text being
indented by one ASCII TAB (0001001) character, which under Unix and
many other environments gives the appearance of an 8-space indent.

Early mail and netnews readers had no facility for including messages
this way, so people had to paste in copy manually.  BSD `Mail(1)' was
the first message agent to support inclusion, and early Usenetters
emulated its style.  But the TAB character tended to push included
text too far to the right (especially in multiply nested inclusions),
leading to ugly wraparounds.  After a brief period of confusion
(during which an inclusion leader consisting of three or four spaces
became established in EMACS and a few mailers), the use of leading `>'
or `> ' became standard, perhaps owing to its use in `ed(1)' to
display tabs (alternatively, it may derive from the `>' that some
early Unix mailers used to quote lines starting with "From" in text,
so they wouldn't look like the beginnings of new message headers).
Inclusions within inclusions keep their `>' leaders, so the `nesting
level' of a quotation is visually apparent.

The practice of including text from the parent article when posting a
followup helped solve what had been a major nuisance on Usenet: the
fact that articles do not arrive at different sites in the same order.
Careless posters used to post articles that would begin with, or even
consist entirely of, "No, that's wrong" or "I agree" or the like.
It was hard to see who was responding to what.  Consequently, around
1984, new news-posting software evolved a facility to automatically
include the text of a previous article, marked with "> " or whatever
the poster chose.  The poster was expected to delete all but the
relevant lines.  The result has been that, now, careless posters post
articles containing the *entire* text of a preceding article,
*followed* only by "No, that's wrong" or "I agree".  

Many people feel that this cure is worse than the original disease,
and there soon appeared newsreader software designed to let the reader
skip over included text if desired.  Today, some posting software
rejects articles containing too high a proportion of lines beginning
with `>' -- but this too has led to undesirable workarounds, such as
the deliberate inclusion of zero-content filler lines which aren't
quoted and thus pull the message below the rejection threshold.


Because the default mailers supplied with Unix and other operating
systems haven't evolved as quickly as human usage, the older
conventions using a leading TAB or three or four spaces are still
alive; however, >-inclusion is now clearly the prevalent form in both
netnews and mail.

In 1991 practice is still evolving, and disputes over the `correct'
inclusion style occasionally lead to @{"holy wars" LINK "jarg_H" 753}.  One variant
style reported uses the citation character `|' in place of `>' for
extended quotations where original variations in indentation are being
retained.  One also sees different styles of quoting a number of
authors in the same message: one (deprecated because it loses
information) uses a leader of `> ' for everyone, another (the most
common) is `> > > > ', `> > > ', etc. (or `>>>> ',
`>>> ', etc., depending on line length and nesting depth)
reflecting the original order of messages, and yet another is to use a
different citation leader for each author, say `> ', `: ', `| ', `} '
(preserving nesting so that the inclusion order of messages is still
apparent, or tagging the inclusions with authors' names).  Yet
*another* style is to use each poster's initials (or login name)
as a citation leader for that poster.  Occasionally one sees a `# '
leader used for quotations from authoritative sources such as
standards documents; the intended allusion is to the root prompt (the
special Unix command prompt issued when one is running as the
privileged super-user).

@{b}Hacker Speech Style@{ub}
=====================

Hackish speech generally features extremely precise diction, careful
word choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively
little use of contractions or street slang.  Dry humor, irony, puns,
and a mildly flippant attitude are highly valued -- but an underlying
seriousness and intelligence are essential.  One should use just
enough jargon to communicate precisely and identify oneself as a
member of the culture; overuse of jargon or a breathless, excessively
gung-ho attitude is considered tacky and the mark of a loser.

This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally
spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical
fields.  In contrast with the methods of jargon construction, it is
fairly constant throughout hackerdom.

It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative
questions -- or, at least, that the people to whom they are talking
are often confused by the sense of their answers.  The problem is that
they have done so much programming that distinguishes between

     if (going) ...

and

     if (!going) ...

that when they parse the question "Aren't you going?" it seems to be
asking the opposite question from "Are you going?", and so merits an
answer in the opposite sense.  This confuses English-speaking
non-hackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative
part weren't there.  In some other languages (including Russian,
Chinese, and Japanese) the hackish interpretation is standard and the
problem wouldn't arise.  Hackers often find themselves wishing for a
word like French `si' or German `doch' with which one could
unambiguously answer `yes' to a negative question.

For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use double
negatives, even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows
them.  The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an
affirmative knowing it will be misparsed as a negative tends to
disturb them.
  
In a related vein, hackers sometimes make a game of answering
questions containing logical connectives with a strictly literal
rather than colloquial interpretation.  A non-hacker who is indelicate
enough to ask a question like "So, are you working on finding that bug
*now* or leaving it until later?"  is likely to get the perfectly
correct answer "Yes!" (that is, "Yes, I'm doing it either now or
later, and you didn't ask which!").

@{b}International Style@{ub}
=====================

Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage
in American English, we have made some effort to get input from
abroad.  Though the hacker-speak of other languages often uses
translations of jargon from English (often as transmitted to them by
earlier Jargon File versions!), the local variations are interesting,
and knowledge of them may be of some use to travelling hackers.

There are some references herein to `Commonwealth hackish'.  These are
intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in
the English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth (Canada,
Australia, India, etc. -- though Canada is heavily influenced by
American usage).  There is also an entry on @{"Commonwealth Hackish" LINK "jarg_C" 771}
reporting some general phonetic and vocabulary differences from
U.S. hackish.

Hackers in Western Europe and (especially) Scandinavia report that
they often use a mixture of English and their native languages for
technical conversation.  Occasionally they develop idioms in their
English usage that are influenced by their native-language styles.
Some of these are reported here.

On the other hand, English often gives rise to grammatical and
vocabulary mutations in the native language.  For example, Italian
hackers often use the nonexistent verbs `scrollare' (to scroll) and
`deletare' (to delete) rather than native Italian `scorerre' and
`cancellare'.  Similarly, the English verb `to hack' has been seen
conjugated in Swedish.  European hackers report that this happens
partly because the English terms make finer distinctions than are
available in their native vocabularies, and partly because deliberate
language-crossing makes for amusing wordplay.

A few notes on hackish usages in Russian have been added where they
are parallel with English idioms and thus comprehensible to
English-speakers.

From the late 1980s onward, a flourishing culture of local,
MS-DOS-based bulletin boards has been developing separately from
Internet hackerdom.  The BBS culture has, as its seamy underside, a
stratum of `pirate boards' inhabited by @{"cracker" LINK "jarg_C" 1253}s, phone phreaks, and
@{"warez d00dz" LINK "jarg_W" 199}.  These people (mostly teenagers running PC-clones from
their bedrooms) have developed their own characteristic jargon,
heavily influenced by skateboard lingo and underground-rock slang.

Though crackers often call themselves `hackers', they aren't (they
typically have neither significant programming ability, nor Internet
expertise, nor experience with UNIX or other true multi-user systems).
Their vocabulary has little overlap with hackerdom's.  Nevertheless,
this lexicon covers much of it so the reader will be able to
understand what goes by on bulletin-board systems.

Here is a brief guide to cracker and @{"warez d00dz" LINK "jarg_W" 199} usage:

   * Misspell frequently.  The substitutions

               phone => fone
               freak => phreak

     are obligatory.
   * Always substitute `z's for `s's.  (i.e. "codes" -> "codez").
   * Type random emphasis characters after a post line (i.e. "Hey
     Dudes!#!$#$!#!$").
   * Use the emphatic `k' prefix ("k-kool", "k-rad", "k-awesome")
     frequently.
   * Abbreviate compulsively ("I got lotsa warez w/ docs").
   * Substitute `0' for `o' ("r0dent", "l0zer").
   * TYPE ALL IN CAPS LOCK, SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YELLING ALL THE
     TIME.

These traits are similar to those of @{"B1FF" LINK "jarg_B" 554}, who originated as a
parody of naive BBS users.  For further discussion of the pirate-board
subculture, see @{"lamer" LINK "jarg_L" 11}, @{"elite" LINK "jarg_E" 143}, @{"leech" LINK "jarg_L" 130}, @{"poser" LINK "jarg_P" 784}, @{"cracker" LINK "jarg_C" 1253}, and
especially @{"warez d00dz" LINK "jarg_W" 199}.

@{b}How to Use the Lexicon@{ub}
************************

@{b}Pronunciation Guide@{ub}
=====================

Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listings for all entries
that are neither dictionary words pronounced as in standard English
nor obvious compounds thereof.  Slashes bracket phonetic
pronunciations, which are to be interpreted using the following
conventions:

  1. Syllables are hyphen-separated, except that an accent or
     back-accent follows each accented syllable (the back-accent marks
     a secondary accent in some words of four or more syllables).  If
     no accent is given, the word is pronounced with equal
     accentuation on all syllables (this is common for abbreviations).

  2. Consonants are pronounced as in American English.  The letter `g'
     is always hard (as in "got" rather than "giant"); `ch' is soft
     ("church" rather than "chemist").  The letter `j' is the sound
     that occurs twice in "judge".  The letter `s' is always as in
     "pass", never a z sound.  The digraph `kh' is the guttural of
     "loch" or "l'chaim".  The digraph 'gh' is the aspirated g+h of
     "bughouse" or "ragheap" (rare in English).

  3. Uppercase letters are pronounced as their English letter names;
     thus (for example) /H-L-L/ is equivalent to /aych el el/.  /Z/
     may be pronounced /zee/ or /zed/ depending on your local dialect.

  4. Vowels are represented as follows:

     a
            back, that
     ah
            father, palm (see note)
     ar
            far, mark
     aw
            flaw, caught
     ay
            bake, rain
     e
            less, men
     ee
            easy, ski
     eir
            their, software
     i
            trip, hit
     i:
            life, sky
     o
            block, stock (see note)
     oh
            flow, sew
     oo
            loot, through
     or
            more, door
     ow
            out, how
     oy
            boy, coin
     uh
            but, some
     u
            put, foot
     y
            yet, young
     yoo
            few, chew
     [y]oo
            /oo/ with optional fronting as in `news' (/nooz/ or
          /nyooz/)

A /*/ is used for the `schwa' sound of unstressed or occluded vowels
(the one that is often written with an upside-down `e').  The schwa
vowel is omitted in syllables containing vocalic r, l, m or n; that
is, `kitten' and `color' would be rendered /kit'n/ and /kuhl'r/, not
/kit'*n/ and /kuhl'*r/.

Note that the above table reflects mainly distinctions found in
standard American English (that is, the neutral dialect spoken by TV
network announcers and typical of educated speech in the Upper
Midwest, Chicago, Minneapolis/St.Paul and Philadelphia).  However, we
separate /o/ from /ah/, which tend to merge in standard American.
This may help readers accustomed to accents resembling British
Received Pronunciation.

The intent of this scheme is to permit as many readers as possible to
map the pronunciations into their local dialect by ignoring some
subset of the distinctions we make.  Speakers of British RP, for
example, can smash terminal /r/ and all unstressed vowels.  Speakers
of many varieties of southern American will automatically map /o/ to
/aw/; and so forth.  (Standard American makes a good reference dialect
for this purpose because it has crisp consonents and more vowel
distinctions than other major dialects, and tends to retain
distinctions between unstressed vowels.  It also happens to be what
your editor speaks.)

Entries with a pronunciation of `//' are written-only usages.  (No,
Unix weenies, this does *not* mean `pronounce like previous
pronunciation'!)

@{b}Other Lexicon Conventions@{ub}
===========================

Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than
the letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in
mainstream dictionaries), except that all entries beginning with
nonalphabetic characters are sorted after Z.  The case-blindness is a
feature, not a bug.

The beginning of each entry is marked by a colon (`:') at the left
margin.  This convention helps out tools like hypertext browsers that
benefit from knowing where entry boundaries are, but aren't as
context-sensitive as humans.

In pure ASCII renderings of the Jargon File, you will see {} used to
bracket words which themselves have entries in the File.  This isn't
done all the time for every such word, but it is done everywhere that
a reminder seems useful that the term has a jargon meaning and one
might wish to refer to its entry.

In this all-ASCII version, headwords for topic entries are
distinguished from those for ordinary entries by being followed by
"::" rather than ":"; similarly, references are surrounded by "{{" and
"}}" rather than "{" and "}".

Defining instances of terms and phrases appear in `slanted type'.  A
defining instance is one which occurs near to or as part of an
explanation of it.

Prefix ** is used as linguists do; to mark examples of incorrect
usage.

We follow the `logical' quoting convention described in the Writing
Style section above.  In addition, we reserve double quotes for actual
excerpts of text or (sometimes invented) speech.  Scare quotes (which
mark a word being used in a nonstandard way), and philosopher's quotes
(which turn an utterance into the string of letters or words that name
it) are both rendered with single quotes.

References such as `malloc(3)' and `patch(1)' are to Unix facilities
(some of which, such as `patch(1)', are actually freeware distributed
over Usenet).  The Unix manuals use `foo(n)' to refer to item foo in
section (n) of the manual, where n=1 is utilities, n=2 is system
calls, n=3 is C library routines, n=6 is games, and n=8 (where
present) is system administration utilities.  Sections 4, 5, and 7 of
the manuals have changed roles frequently and in any case are not
referred to in any of the entries.

Various abbreviations used frequently in the lexicon are summarized
here:

abbrev.
     abbreviation
adj.
     adjective
adv.
     adverb
alt.
     alternate
cav.
     caveat
conj.
     conjunction
esp.
     especially
excl.
     exclamation
imp.
     imperative
interj.
     interjection
n.
     noun
obs.
     obsolete
pl.
     plural
poss.
     possibly
pref.
     prefix
prob.
     probably
prov.
     proverbial
quant.
     quantifier
suff.
     suffix
syn.
     synonym (or synonymous with)
v.
     verb (may be transitive or intransitive)
var.
     variant
vi.
     intransitive verb
vt.
     transitive verb

Where alternate spellings or pronunciations are given, alt.  separates
two possibilities with nearly equal distribution, while var. prefixes
one that is markedly less common than the primary.

Where a term can be attributed to a particular subculture or is known
to have originated there, we have tried to so indicate.  Here is a
list of abbreviations used in etymologies:

Amateur Packet Radio
     A technical culture of ham-radio sites using AX.25 and TCP/IP for
     wide-area networking and BBS systems.

     Samson in 1959

Some other etymology abbreviations such as @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54} and @{"PDP-10" LINK "jarg_P" 264} refer
to technical cultures surrounding specific operating systems,
processors, or other environments.  The fact that a term is labelled
with any one of these abbreviations does not necessarily mean its use
is confined to that culture.  In particular, many terms labelled `MIT'
and `Stanford' are in quite general use.  We have tried to give some
indication of the distribution of speakers in the usage notes;
however, a number of factors mentioned in the introduction conspire to
make these indications less definite than might be desirable.

A few new definitions attached to entries are marked [proposed].
These are usually generalizations suggested by editors or Usenet
respondents in the process of commenting on previous definitions of
those entries.  These are *not* represented as established jargon.

@{b}Format For New Entries@{ub}
========================

All contributions and suggestions about the Jargon File will be
considered donations to be placed in the public domain as part of this
File, and may be used in subsequent paper editions.  Submissions may
be edited for accuracy, clarity and concision.

Try to conform to the format already being used in the ASCII on-line version
--- head-words separated from text by a colon (double colon for topic
entries), cross-references in curly brackets (doubled for topic
entries), pronunciations in slashes, etymologies in square brackets,
single-space after definition numbers and word classes, etc.  Stick to
the standard ASCII character set (7-bit printable, no high-half
characters or [nt]roff/TeX/Scribe escapes), as one of the versions
generated from the master file is an info document that has to be
viewable on a character tty.

We are looking to expand the File's range of technical specialties
covered.  There are doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the
scientific computing, graphics, and networking hacker communities;
also in numerical analysis, computer architectures and VLSI design,
language design, and many other related fields.  Send us your jargon!

We are *not* interested in straight technical terms explained by
textbooks or technical dictionaries unless an entry illuminates
`underground' meanings or aspects not covered by official histories.
We are also not interested in `joke' entries -- there is a lot of
humor in the file but it must flow naturally out of the explanations
of what hackers do and how they think.

It is OK to submit items of jargon you have originated if they have
spread to the point of being used by people who are not personally
acquainted with you.  We prefer items to be attested by independent
submission from two different sites.

There is now an HTML version of the File available at
//www.ccil.org/jargon.  Please send us URLs for materials related to
the entries, so we can enrich the File's link structure.

The Jargon File will be regularly maintained and made available for
FTP over Internet, and will include a version number.  Read it, pass
it around, contribute -- this is *your* monument!

@endnode
@node jarg_A "A"
@{b}abbrev@{ub} /*-breev'/, /*-brev'/ n.  Common abbreviation for
   `abbreviation'.

@{b}ABEND@{ub} /o'bend/, /*-bend'/ n.  [ABnormal END] Abnormal
   termination (of software); @{"crash" LINK "jarg_C" 1306}; @{"lossage" LINK "jarg_L" 580}.  Derives from
   an error message on the IBM 360; used jokingly by hackers but
   seriously mainly by @{"code grinder" LINK "jarg_C" 613}s.  Usually capitalized, but
   may appear as `abend'.  Hackers will try to persuade you that
   ABEND is called `abend' because it is what system operators do to
   the machine late on Friday when they want to call it a day, and
   hence is from the German `Abend' = `Evening'.

@{b}accumulator@{ub} n.  1. Archaic term for a register.  On-line use
   of it as a synonym for `register' is a fairly reliable
   indication that the user has been around for quite a while and/or
   that the architecture under discussion is quite old.  The term in
   full is almost never used of microprocessor registers, for example,
   though symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in `A'
   derive from historical use of the term `accumulator' (and not,
   actually, from `arithmetic').  Confusingly, though, an `A'
   register name prefix may also stand for `address', as for
   example on the Motorola 680x0 family.  2. A register being used for
   arithmetic or logic (as opposed to addressing or a loop index),
   especially one being used to accumulate a sum or count of many
   items.  This use is in context of a particular routine or stretch
   of code.  "The FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an accumulator."
   3. One's in-basket (esp. among old-timers who might use sense 1).
   "You want this reviewed?  Sure, just put it in the accumulator."
   (See @{"stack" LINK "jarg_S" 1573}.)

@{b}ACK@{ub} /ak/ interj.  1. [from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110]
   Acknowledge.  Used to register one's presence (compare mainstream
   *Yo!*).  An appropriate response to @{"ping" LINK "jarg_P" 503} or @{"ENQ" LINK "jarg_E" 317}.
   2. [from the comic strip "Bloom County"] An exclamation of
   surprised disgust, esp. in "Ack pffft!"  Semi-humorous.
   Generally this sense is not spelled in caps (ACK) and is
   distinguished by a following exclamation point.  3. Used to
   politely interrupt someone to tell them you understand their point
   (see @{"NAK" LINK "jarg_N" 62}).  Thus, for example, you might cut off an overly
   long explanation with "Ack.  Ack.  Ack.  I get it now".

   There is also a usage "ACK?" (from sense 1) meaning "Are you
   there?", often used in email when earlier mail has produced no
   reply, or during a lull in @{"talk mode" LINK "jarg_T" 19} to see if the person has
   gone away (the standard humorous response is of course @{"NAK" LINK "jarg_N" 62}
   (sense 2), i.e., "I'm not here").

@{b}Acme@{ub} n. The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate, and
   non-functional gadgetry -- where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson
   shop.  Describing some X as an "Acme X" either means "This is
   @{"insanely great" LINK "jarg_I" 307}", or, more likely, "This looks @{"insanely great" LINK "jarg_I" 307} 
   on paper, but in practice it's really easy to shoot yourself
   in the foot with it."  Compare @{"pistol" LINK "jarg_P" 559}.

   This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained
   here for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the
   Warner Brothers' series of "Roadrunner" cartoons.  In these
   cartoons, the famished Wile E. Coyote was forever attempting to
   catch up with, trap, and eat the Roadrunner.  His attempts usually
   involved one or more high-technology Rube Goldberg devices --
   rocket jetpacks, catapults, magnetic traps, high-powered
   slingshots, etc.  These were usually delivered in large cardboard
   boxes, labeled prominently with the Acme name.  These devices
   invariably malfunctioned in violent and improbable ways.

@{b}acolyte@{ub} n.,obs.  [TMRC] An @{"OSU" LINK "jarg_O" 321} privileged enough to
   submit data and programs to a member of the @{"priesthood" LINK "jarg_P" 894}.

@{b}ad-hockery@{ub} /ad-hok'*r-ee/ n.  [Purdue] 1. Gratuitous
   assumptions made inside certain programs, esp. expert systems,
   which lead to the appearance of semi-intelligent behavior but are
   in fact entirely arbitrary.  For example, fuzzy-matching against
   input tokens that might be typing errors against a symbol table can
   make it look as though a program knows how to spell.
   2. Special-case code to cope with some awkward input that would
   otherwise cause a program to @{"choke" LINK "jarg_C" 447}, presuming normal inputs
   are dealt with in some cleaner and more regular way.  Also called
   `ad-hackery', `ad-hocity' (/ad-hos'*-tee/), `ad-crockery'.
   See also @{"ELIZA effect" LINK "jarg_E" 151}.

@{b}@{u}Ada@{uu}@{ub} n.  A @{"Pascal" LINK "jarg_P" 89}-descended language that has been made
   mandatory for Department of Defense software projects by the
   Pentagon.  Hackers are nearly unanimous in observing that,
   technically, it is precisely what one might expect given that kind
   of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee, crockish, difficult
   to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar boondoggle
   (one common description is "The PL/I of the 1980s").  Hackers
   find Ada's exception-handling and inter-process communication
   features particularly hilarious.  Ada Lovelace (the daughter of
   Lord Byron who became the world's first programmer while
   cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his mechanical
   computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly blanch
   at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the kindest
   thing that has been said about it is that there is probably a good
   small language screaming to get out from inside its vast,
   @{"elephantine" LINK "jarg_E" 120} bulk.

@{b}adger@{ub} /aj'r/ vt.  [UCLA mutant of @{"nadger" LINK "jarg_N" 20}] To make a
   bonehead move with consequences that could have been foreseen with
   even slight mental effort.  E.g., "He started removing files and
   promptly adgered the whole project".  Compare @{"dumbass attack" LINK "jarg_D" 1120}.

@{b}admin@{ub} /ad-min'/ n.  Short for `administrator'; very
   commonly used in speech or on-line to refer to the systems person
   in charge on a computer.  Common constructions on this include
   `sysadmin' and `site admin' (emphasizing the administrator's
   role as a site contact for email and news) or `newsadmin'
   (focusing specifically on news).  Compare @{"postmaster" LINK "jarg_P" 811},
   @{"sysop" LINK "jarg_S" 1944}, @{"system mangler" LINK "jarg_S" 1959}.

@{b}ADVENT@{ub} /ad'vent/ n.  The prototypical computer adventure
   game, first designed by Will Crowther on the @{"PDP-10" LINK "jarg_P" 264} in the
   mid-1970s as an attempt at computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and
   expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford in
   1976.  Now better known as Adventure, but the @{"TOPS-10" LINK "jarg_T" 881}
   operating system permitted only six-letter filenames.  See also
   @{"vadding" LINK "jarg_V" 3}, @{"Zork" LINK "jarg_Z" 92}, and @{"Infocom" LINK "jarg_I" 283}.

   This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in
   text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have
   become fixtures of hacker-speak: "A huge green fierce snake bars
   the way!"  "I see no X here" (for some noun X).  "You are in a
   maze of twisty little passages, all alike."  "You are in a little
   maze of twisty passages, all different."  The `magic words'
   @{"xyzzy" LINK "jarg_X" 48} and @{"plugh" LINK "jarg_P" 697} also derive from this game.

   Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the
   Mammoth & Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a
   `Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that
   also turns up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary
   entrance.

@{b}AFAIK@{ub} // n.  [Usenet] Abbrev. for "As Far As I Know".

@{b}AFJ@{ub} // n.  Written-only abbreviation for "April Fool's
   Joke".  Elaborate April Fool's hoaxes are a long-established
   tradition on Usenet and Internet; see @{"kremvax" LINK "jarg_K" 258} for an example.
   In fact, April Fool's Day is the *only* seasonal holiday
   marked by customary observances on the hacker networks.

@{b}AI@{ub} /A-I/ n.  Abbreviation for `Artificial Intelligence',
   so common that the full form is almost never written or spoken
   among hackers.

@{b}AI-complete@{ub} /A-I k*m-pleet'/ adj.  [MIT, Stanford: by
   analogy with `NP-complete' (see @{"NP-" LINK "jarg_N" 579})] Used to describe
   problems or subproblems in AI, to indicate that the solution
   presupposes a solution to the `strong AI problem' (that is, the
   synthesis of a human-level intelligence).  A problem that is
   AI-complete is, in other words, just too hard.

   Examples of AI-complete problems are `The Vision Problem'
   (building a system that can see as well as a human) and `The
   Natural Language Problem' (building a system that can understand
   and speak a natural language as well as a human).  These may appear
   to be modular, but all attempts so far (1996) to solve them have
   foundered on the amount of context information and `intelligence'
   they seem to require. See also @{"gedanken" LINK "jarg_G" 119}.

@{b}AI koans@{ub} /A-I koh'anz/ pl.n.  A series of pastiches of Zen
   teaching riddles created by Danny Hillis at the MIT AI Lab around
   various major figures of the Lab's culture (several are included
   under @{"AI Koans" LINK "jarg_app" 353} in Appendix A).  See also @{"ha ha only serious" LINK "jarg_H" 14}, 
   @{"mu" LINK "jarg_M" 1041}, and @{"Humor, Hacker" LINK "jarg_H" 894}.

@{b}AIDS@{ub} /aydz/ n.  Short for A* Infected Disk Syndrome (`A*'
   is a @{"glob" LINK "jarg_G" 334} pattern that matches, but is not limited to, Apple),
   this condition is quite often the result of practicing unsafe
   @{"SEX" LINK "jarg_S" 585}.  See @{"virus" LINK "jarg_V" 323}, @{"worm" LINK "jarg_W" 674}, @{"Trojan horse" LINK "jarg_T" 1063},
   @{"virgin" LINK "jarg_V" 276}.

@{b}AIDX@{ub} n. /aydkz/ n.  Derogatory term for IBM's perverted
   version of Unix, AIX, especially for the AIX 3.? used in the IBM
   RS/6000 series (some hackers think it is funnier just to pronounce
   "AIX" as "aches").  A victim of the dreaded "hybridism"
   disease, this attempt to combine the two main currents of the Unix
   stream (@{"BSD" LINK "jarg_B" 1854} and @{"USG Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 242}) became a @{"monstrosity" LINK "jarg_M" 911} to
   haunt system administrators' dreams.  For example, if new accounts
   are created while many users are logged on, the load average jumps
   quickly over 20 due to silly implementation of the user databases.
   For a quite similar disease, compare @{"HP-SUX" LINK "jarg_H" 866}.  Also, compare
   @{"Macintrash" LINK "jarg_M" 24} @{"Nominal Semidestructor" LINK "jarg_N" 523}, @{"Open DeathTrap" LINK "jarg_O" 218},
   @{"ScumOS" LINK "jarg_S" 449}, @{"sun-stools" LINK "jarg_S" 1787}.

@{b}airplane rule@{ub} n.  "Complexity increases the possibility of
   failure; a twin-engine airplane has twice as many engine problems
   as a single-engine airplane."  By analogy, in both software and
   electronics, the rule that simplicity increases robustness.  It is
   correspondingly argued that the right way to build reliable systems
   is to put all your eggs in one basket, after making sure that
   you've built a really *good* basket.  See also @{"KISS Principle" LINK "jarg_K" 116}.

@{b}aliasing bug@{ub} n.  A class of subtle programming errors that
   can arise in code that does dynamic allocation, esp. via
   `malloc(3)' or equivalent.  If several pointers address
   (`aliases for') a given hunk of storage, it may happen that the
   storage is freed or reallocated (and thus moved) through one alias
   and then referenced through another, which may lead to subtle (and
   possibly intermittent) lossage depending on the state and the
   allocation history of the malloc @{"arena" LINK "jarg_A" 351}.  Avoidable by use of
   allocation strategies that never alias allocated core, or by use of
   higher-level languages, such as @{"LISP" LINK "jarg_L" 371}, which employ a garbage
   collector (see @{"GC" LINK "jarg_G" 71}).  Also called a @{"stale pointer bug" LINK "jarg_S" 1606}.
   See also @{"precedence lossage" LINK "jarg_P" 855}, @{"smash the stack" LINK "jarg_S" 960},
   @{"fandango on core" LINK "jarg_F" 60}, @{"memory leak" LINK "jarg_M" 448}, @{"memory smash" LINK "jarg_M" 460},
   @{"overrun screw" LINK "jarg_O" 383}, @{"spam" LINK "jarg_S" 1403}.

   Historical note: Though this term is nowadays associated with
   C programming, it was already in use in a very similar sense in the
   Algol-60 and FORTRAN communities in the 1960s.

@{b}all-elbows@{ub} adj.  [MS-DOS] Of a TSR
   (terminate-and-stay-resident) IBM PC program, such as the N
   pop-up calendar and calculator utilities that circulate on @{"BBS" LINK "jarg_B" 439}
   systems: unsociable.  Used to describe a program that rudely steals
   the resources that it needs without considering that other TSRs may
   also be resident.  One particularly common form of rudeness is
   lock-up due to programs fighting over the keyboard interrupt.  See
   @{"rude" LINK "jarg_R" 700}, also @{"mess-dos" LINK "jarg_M" 476}.

@{b}alpha particles@{ub} n.  See @{"bit rot" LINK "jarg_B" 823}.

@{b}alt@{ub} /awlt/  1. n. The alt shift key on an IBM PC or
   @{"clone" LINK "jarg_C" 565} keyboard; see @{"bucky bits" LINK "jarg_B" 1894}, sense 2 (though typical
   PC usage does not simply set the 0200 bit).  2. n. The `clover'
   or `Command' key on a Macintosh; use of this term usually reveals
   that the speaker hacked PCs before coming to the Mac (see also
   @{"feature key" LINK "jarg_F" 214}).  Some Mac hackers, confusingly, reserve `alt'
   for the Option key (and it is so labeled on some Mac II keyboards).
   3. n.obs.  [PDP-10; often capitalized to ALT] Alternate name for
   the ASCII ESC character (ASCII 0011011), after the keycap labeling
   on some older terminals; also `altmode' (/awlt'mohd/).  This
   character was almost never pronounced `escape' on an ITS system,
   in @{"TECO" LINK "jarg_T" 312}, or under TOPS-10 -- always alt, as in "Type alt alt
   to end a TECO command" or "alt-U onto the system" (for "log
   onto the [ITS] system").  This usage probably arose because alt is
   more convenient to say than `escape', especially when followed by
   another alt or a character (or another alt *and* a character,
   for that matter).  3. The alt hierarchy on Usenet, the tree of
   newsgroups created by users without a formal vote and approval
   procedure.  There is a myth, not entirely implausible, that
   alt is acronymic for "anarchists, lunatics, and terrorists";
   but in fact it is simply short for "alternative".

@{b}alt bit@{ub} /awlt bit/ [from alternate] adj.  See @{"meta bit" LINK "jarg_M" 494}.

@{b}altmode@{ub} n.  Syn. @{"alt" LINK "jarg_A" 223} sense 3.

@{b}Aluminum Book@{ub} n.  [MIT] "Common LISP: The Language", by
   Guy L.  Steele Jr. (Digital Press, first edition 1984, second
   edition 1990).  Note that due to a technical screwup some printings
   of the second edition are actually of a color the author describes
   succinctly as "yucky green".  See also @{"book titles" LINK "jarg_B" 1461}.

@{b}amoeba@{ub} n.  Humorous term for the Commodore Amiga personal
   computer.

@{b}amp off@{ub} vt.  [Purdue] To run in @{"background" LINK "jarg_B" 67}.  From the
   Unix shell `&' operator.

@{b}amper@{ub} n.  Common abbreviation for the name of the ampersand
   (`&', ASCII 0100110) character.  See @{"ASCII" LINK "jarg_A" 413} for other synonyms.

@{b}angle brackets@{ub} n.  Either of the characters `<' (ASCII
   0111100) and `>' (ASCII 0111110) (ASCII less-than or
   greater-than signs).  Typographers in the @{"Real World" LINK "jarg_R" 267} use angle
   brackets which are either taller and slimmer (the ISO `Bra' and
   `Ket' characters), or significantly smaller (single or double
   guillemets) than the less-than and greater-than signs.
   See @{"broket" LINK "jarg_B" 1760}, @{"ASCII" LINK "jarg_A" 413}.

@{b}angry fruit salad@{ub} n.  A bad visual-interface design that
   uses too many colors.  (This term derives, of course, from the
   bizarre day-glo colors found in canned fruit salad.)  Too often one
   sees similar effects from interface designers using color window
   systems such as @{"X" LINK "jarg_X" 1}; there is a tendency to create displays that
   are flashy and attention-getting but uncomfortable for long-term
   use.

@{b}annoybot@{ub} /*-noy-bot/ n.  [IRC] See @{"robot" LINK "jarg_R" 538}.

@{b}ANSI@{ub} n. /an'see/  1. n. [techspeak] The American National
   Standards Institue. ANSI, along with the International Standards
   Organization (ISO), standardized the C programming language (see
   @{"K&R" LINK "jarg_K" 5}, @{"Classic C" LINK "jarg_C" 522}), and promulgates many other important
   software standards.  2. n. [techspeak] A terminal may be said to be
   `ANSI' if it meets the ANSI X.364 standard for terminal control.
   Unfortunately, this standard was both over-complicated and too
   permissive.  It has been retired and replaced by the ECMA-48
   standard, which shares both flaws.  3. n. [BBS jargon] The set of
   screen-painting codes that most MS-DOS and Amiga computers accept.
   This comes from the ANSI.SYS device driver that must be loaded on
   an MS-DOS computer to view such codes.  Unfortunately, neither DOS
   ANSI nor the BBS ANSIs derived from it exactly match the ANSI X.364
   terminal standard.  For example, the ESC-[1m code turns on the bold
   highlight on large machines, but in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it turns on
   `intense' (bright) colors.  Also, in BBS-land, the term `ANSI' is
   often used to imply that a particular computer uses or can emulate
   the IBM high-half character set from MS-DOS.  Particular use
   depends on context. Occasionally, the vanilla ASCII character set
   is used with the color codes, but on BBSs, ANSI and `IBM
   characters' tend to go together.

@{b}AOS@{ub} 1. /aws/ (East Coast), /ay-os/ (West Coast) vt.,obs. 
   To increase the amount of something. "AOS the campfire."
   [based on a PDP-10 increment instruction] Usage:
   considered silly, and now obsolete.  Now largely supplanted by
   @{"bump" LINK "jarg_B" 2080}.  See @{"SOS" LINK "jarg_S" 1305}.  2. n. A @{"Multics" LINK "jarg_M" 1145}-derived OS
   supported at one time by Data General.  This was pronounced
   /A-O-S/ or /A-os/.  A spoof of the standard AOS system
   administrator's manual ("How to Load and Generate your AOS
   System") was created, issued a part number, and circulated as
   photocopy folklore; it was called "How to Goad and Levitate
   your CHAOS System".  3. n. Algebraic Operating System, in reference
   to those calculators which use infix instead of postfix (reverse
   Polish) notation.  4. A @{"BSD" LINK "jarg_B" 1854}-like operating system for the IBM
   RT.

   Historical note: AOS in sense 1 was the name of a @{"PDP-10" LINK "jarg_P" 264}
   instruction that took any memory location in the computer and added
   1 to it; AOS meant `Add One and do not Skip'.  Why, you may ask,
   does the `S' stand for `do not Skip' rather than for `Skip'?  Ah,
   here was a beloved piece of PDP-10 folklore.  There were eight such
   instructions: AOSE added 1 and then skipped the next instruction
   if the result was Equal to zero; AOSG added 1 and then skipped if
   the result was Greater than 0; AOSN added 1 and then skipped
   if the result was Not 0; AOSA added 1 and then skipped Always;
   and so on.  Just plain AOS didn't say when to skip, so it never
   skipped.

   For similar reasons, AOJ meant `Add One and do not Jump'.  Even
   more bizarre, SKIP meant `do not SKIP'!  If you wanted to skip the
   next instruction, you had to say `SKIPA'.  Likewise, JUMP meant
   `do not JUMP'; the unconditional form was JUMPA.  However, hackers
   never did this.  By some quirk of the 10's design, the @{"JRST" LINK "jarg_J" 132}
   (Jump and ReSTore flag with no flag specified) was actually faster
   and so was invariably used.  Such were the perverse mysteries of
   assembler programming.

@{b}app@{ub} /ap/ n.  Short for `application program', as opposed
   to a systems program.  Apps are what systems vendors are forever
   chasing developers to create for their environments so they can
   sell more boxes.  Hackers tend not to think of the things they
   themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker parlance the term excludes
   compilers, program editors, games, and messaging systems, though a
   user would consider all those to be apps.  (Broadly, an app is
   often a self-contained environment for performing some well-defined
   task such as `word processing'; hackers tend to prefer more
   general-purpose tools.) Oppose @{"tool" LINK "jarg_T" 849}, @{"operating system" LINK "jarg_O" 228}.

@{b}arena@{ub} [Unix] n.  The area of memory attached to a process by
   `brk(2)' and `sbrk(2)' and used by `malloc(3)' as
   dynamic storage.  So named from a `malloc: corrupt arena'
   message emitted when some early versions detected an impossible
   value in the free block list.  See @{"overrun screw" LINK "jarg_O" 383}, @{"aliasing bug" LINK "jarg_A" 193}, 
   @{"memory leak" LINK "jarg_M" 448}, @{"memory smash" LINK "jarg_M" 460}, @{"smash the stack" LINK "jarg_S" 960}.

@{b}arg@{ub} /arg/ n.  Abbreviation for `argument' (to a
   function), used so often as to have become a new word (like
   `piano' from `pianoforte').  "The sine function takes 1 arg,
   but the arc-tangent function can take either 1 or 2 args."
   Compare @{"param" LINK "jarg_P" 45}, @{"parm" LINK "jarg_P" 71}, @{"var" LINK "jarg_V" 57}.

@{b}ARMM@{ub} n.  [acronym, `Automated Retroactive Minimal
   Moderation'] A Usenet robot created by Dick Depew of Munroe Falls,
   Ohio.  ARMM was intended to automatically cancel posts from
   anonymous-posting sites.  Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for
   anonymous postings triggered on its own automatically-generated
   control messages!  Transformed by this stroke of programming
   ineptitude into a monster of Frankensteinian proportions, it broke
   loose on the night of March 31, 1993 and proceeded to @{"spam" LINK "jarg_S" 1403}
   news.admin.policy with a recursive explosion of over 200
   messages.

   ARMM's bug produced a recursive @{"cascade" LINK "jarg_C" 173} of messages each of which
   mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and some other
   headers of its parent.  This produced a flood of messages in which
   each header took up several screens and each message ID and subject
   line got longer and longer and longer.

   Reactions varied from amusement to outrage.  The pathological
   messages crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying
   line charges for their Usenet feeds.  One poster described the ARMM
   debacle as "instant Usenet history" (also establishing the term
   @{"despew" LINK "jarg_D" 485}), and it has since been widely cited as a cautionary
   example of the havoc the combination of good intentions and
   incompetence can wreak on a network.  Compare @{"Great Worm, the" LINK "jarg_G" 614};
   @{"sorcerer's apprentice mode" LINK "jarg_S" 1296}.  See also @{"software laser" LINK "jarg_S" 1234},
   @{"network meltdown" LINK "jarg_N" 315}.

@{b}armor-plated@{ub} n.  Syn. for @{"bulletproof" LINK "jarg_B" 2057}.

@{b}asbestos@{ub} adj.  Used as a modifier to anything intended to
   protect one from @{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600}s; also in other highly
   @{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600}-suggestive usages.  See, for example, 
   @{"asbestos longjohns" LINK "jarg_A" 408} and @{"asbestos cork award" LINK "jarg_A" 398}.

@{b}asbestos cork award@{ub} n.  Once, long ago at MIT, there was a
   @{"flamer" LINK "jarg_F" 637} so consistently obnoxious that another hacker designed,
   had made, and distributed posters announcing that said flamer had
   been nominated for the `asbestos cork award'.  (Any reader in
   doubt as to the intended application of the cork should consult the
   etymology under @{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600}.)  Since then, it is agreed that only a
   select few have risen to the heights of bombast required to earn
   this dubious dignity -- but there is no agreement on *which*
   few.

@{b}asbestos longjohns@{ub} n.  Notional garments donned by
   @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190} posters just before emitting a remark they expect will
   elicit @{"flamage" LINK "jarg_F" 594}.  This is the most common of the @{"asbestos" LINK "jarg_A" 393}
   coinages.  Also `asbestos underwear', `asbestos overcoat', etc.

@{b}@{u}ASCII@{uu}@{ub} /as'kee/ n.  [acronym: American Standard Code for
   Information Interchange] The predominant character set encoding of
   present-day computers.  The modern version uses 7 bits for each
   character, whereas most earlier codes (including an early version
   of ASCII) used fewer.  This change allowed the inclusion of
   lowercase letters -- a major @{"win" LINK "jarg_W" 493} -- but it did not provide
   for accented letters or any other letterforms not used in English
   (such as the German sharp-S
   or the ae-ligature
   which is a letter in, for example, Norwegian).  It could be worse,
   though.  It could be much worse.  See @{"EBCDIC" LINK "jarg_E" 36} to understand how.
   
   Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than
   humans; thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about
   characters, and have developed a considerable amount of verbal
   shorthand for them.  Every character has one or more names -- some
   formal, some concise, some silly.  Common jargon names for ASCII
   characters are collected here.  See also individual entries for
   @{"bang" LINK "jarg_B" 202}, @{"excl" LINK "jarg_E" 468}, @{"open" LINK "jarg_O" 213}, @{"ques" LINK "jarg_Q" 156}, @{"semi" LINK "jarg_S" 559}, @{"shriek" LINK "jarg_S" 719},
   @{"splat" LINK "jarg_S" 1486}, @{"twiddle" LINK "jarg_T" 1221}, and @{"Yu-Shiang Whole Fish" LINK "jarg_Y" 117}.

   This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII
   pronunciation guide.  Single characters are listed in ASCII order;
   character pairs are sorted in by first member.  For each character,
   common names are given in rough order of popularity, followed by
   names that are reported but rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names
   are surrounded by brokets: <>.  Square brackets mark the
   particularly silly names introduced by @{"INTERCAL" LINK "jarg_I" 312}.  The
   abbreviations "l/r" and "o/c" stand for left/right and
   "open/close" respectively.  Ordinary parentheticals provide some
   usage information.

          wiggle; swung dash; enyay; [sqiggle (sic)].

   The pronunciation of `#' as `pound' is common in the U.S.
   but a bad idea; @{"Commonwealth Hackish" LINK "jarg_C" 771} has its own, rather more
   apposite use of `pound sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards
   the pound graphic
   happens to replace `#'; thus Britishers sometimes
   call `#' on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard `pound', compounding the
   American error).  The U.S. usage derives from an old-fashioned
   commercial practice of using a `#' suffix to tag pound weights
   on bills of lading.  The character is usually pronounced `hash'
   outside the U.S.

   The `uparrow' name for circumflex and `leftarrow' name for
   underline are historical relics from archaic ASCII (the 1963
   version), which had these graphics in those character positions
   rather than the modern punctuation characters.

   The `swung dash' or `approximation' sign is not quite the same
   as tilde in typeset material
   but the ASCII tilde serves for both (compare @{"angle brackets" LINK "jarg_A" 264}).

   Some other common usages cause odd overlaps.  The `#',
   `$', `>', and `&' characters, for example, are all
   pronounced "hex" in different communities because various
   assemblers use them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in
   particular, `#' in many assembler-programming cultures,
   `$' in the 6502 world, `>' at Texas Instruments, and
   `&' on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80 machines).  See
   also @{"splat" LINK "jarg_S" 1486}.

   The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the
   world's other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits
   look more and more like a serious @{"misfeature" LINK "jarg_M" 740} as the use of
   international networks continues to increase (see @{"software rot" LINK "jarg_S" 1246}).
   Hardware and software from the U.S. still tends to embody
   the assumption that ASCII is the universal character set and that
   characters have 7 bits; this is a a major irritant to people who
   want to use a character set suited to their own languages.
   Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem by proliferating
   `national' character sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use
   a *smaller* subset common to all those in use.

@{b}ASCII art@{ub} n.  The fine art of drawing diagrams using the
   ASCII character set (mainly `|', `-', `/', `\',
   and `+').  Also known as `character graphics' or `ASCII
   graphics'; see also @{"boxology" LINK "jarg_B" 1605}.  Here is a serious
   example:


         o----)||(--+--|<----+   +---------o + D O
           L  )||(  |        |   |             C U

         feeding a capacitor input filter circuit

                              Figure 1.

   And here are some very silly examples:


       |\/\/\/|     ____/|              ___    |\_/|    ___
       |      |     \ o.O|   ACK!      /   \_  |` '|  _/   \

                              Figure 2.

   There is an important subgenre of ASCII art that puns on the
   standard character names in the fashion of a rebus.

                              Figure 3.

   Within humorous ASCII art, there is for some reason an entire
   flourishing subgenre of pictures of silly cows.  Four of these are
   reproduced in Figure 2; here are three more:


              (__)              (__)              (__)
              (\/)              ($$)              (**)

                              Figure 4.

   There is a newsgroup, alt.ascii.art, devoted to this
   genre; however, see also @{"warlording" LINK "jarg_W" 242}.

@{b}ASCIIbetical order@{ub} /as'kee-be'-t*-kl or'dr/ adj.,n.  Used
   to indicate that data is sorted in ASCII collated order rather than
   alphabetical order.  This lexicon is sorted in something close to
   ASCIIbetical order, but with case ignored and entries beginning
   with non-alphabetic characters moved to the end.

@{b}atomic@{ub} adj.  [from Gk. `atomos', indivisible]
   1. Indivisible; cannot be split up.  For example, an instruction
   may be said to do several things `atomically', i.e., all the
   things are done immediately, and there is no chance of the
   instruction being half-completed or of another being interspersed.
   Used esp. to convey that an operation cannot be screwed up by
   interrupts.  "This routine locks the file and increments the
   file's semaphore atomically."  2. [primarily techspeak] Guaranteed
   to complete successfully or not at all, usu. refers to database
   transactions.  If an error prevents a partially-performed
   transaction from proceeding to completion, it must be "backed out,"
   as the database must not be left in an inconsistent state.

   Computer usage, in either of the above senses, has none of the
   connotations that `atomic' has in mainstream English (i.e.  of
   particles of matter, nuclear explosions etc.).

@{b}attoparsec@{ub} n.  About an inch.  `atto-' is the standard SI
   prefix for multiplication by 10^(-18).  A parsec
   (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years; an attoparsec is thus
   3.26 * 10^(-18) light years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1
   attoparsec/@{"microfortnight" LINK "jarg_M" 641} equals about 1 inch/sec).  This unit
   is reported to be in use (though probably not very seriously) among
   hackers in the U.K.  See @{"micro-" LINK "jarg_M" 610}.

@{b}autobogotiphobia@{ub} /aw'toh-boh-got`*-foh'bee-*/  n. See
   @{"bogotify" LINK "jarg_B" 1378}.

@{b}automagically@{ub} /aw-toh-maj'i-klee/ adv.  Automatically, but
   in a way that, for some reason (typically because it is too
   complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the speaker
   doesn't feel like explaining to you.  See @{"magic" LINK "jarg_M" 76}.  "The
   C-INTERCAL compiler generates C, then automagically invokes
   `cc(1)' to produce an executable."

@{b}avatar@{ub} n. Syn.  1. Among people working on virtual reality
   and @{"cyberspace" LINK "jarg_C" 1684} interfaces, an "avatar" is an icon or
   representation of a user in a shared virtual reality.  The term is
   sumetimes used on @{"MUD" LINK "jarg_M" 1065}s.  2. [CMU, Tektronix] @{"root" LINK "jarg_R" 583},
   @{"superuser" LINK "jarg_S" 1831}.  There are quite a few Unix machines on which the
   name of the superuser account is `avatar' rather than `root'.
   This quirk was originated by a CMU hacker who disliked the term
   `superuser', and was propagated through an ex-CMU hacker at
   Tektronix.

@{b}awk@{ub} /awk/  1. n. [Unix techspeak] An interpreted language
   for massaging text data developed by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger,
   and Brian Kernighan (the name derives from their initials).  It is
   characterized by C-like syntax, a declaration-free approach to
   variable typing and declarations, associative arrays, and
   field-oriented text processing.  See also @{"Perl" LINK "jarg_P" 356}.  2. n.
   Editing term for an expression awkward to manipulate through normal
   @{"regexp" LINK "jarg_R" 336} facilities (for example, one containing a
   @{"newline" LINK "jarg_N" 385}).  3. vt. To process data using `awk(1)'.

@endnode
@node jarg_B "B"
@{b}back door@{ub} n.  A hole in the security of a system
   deliberately left in place by designers or maintainers.  The
   motivation for such holes is not always sinister; some operating
   systems, for example, come out of the box with privileged accounts
   intended for use by field service technicians or the vendor's
   maintenance programmers.  Syn. @{"trap door" LINK "jarg_T" 968}; may also be called a
   `wormhole'.  See also @{"iron box" LINK "jarg_I" 441}, @{"cracker" LINK "jarg_C" 1253}, @{"worm" LINK "jarg_W" 674},
   @{"logic bomb" LINK "jarg_L" 491}.

   Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than
   anyone expected or planned, and a few have become widely known.
   Ken Thompson's 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM suggested the
   possibility of a back door in early Unix versions that may have
   qualified as the most fiendishly clever security hack of all time
   In this scheme, the C compiler contained code that would recognize
   when the `login' command was being recompiled and insert some
   code recognizing a password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to
   the system whether or not an account had been created for him.

   Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the
   source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler.  But to
   recompile the compiler, you have to *use* the compiler -- so
   Thompson also arranged that the compiler would *recognize when
   it was compiling a version of itself*, and insert into the
   recompiled compiler the code to insert into the recompiled
   `login' the code to allow Thompson entry -- and, of course, the
   code to recognize itself and do the whole thing again the next time
   around!  And having done this once, he was then able to recompile
   the compiler from the original sources; the hack perpetuated itself
   invisibly, leaving the back door in place and active but with no
   trace in the sources.

   The talk that suggested this truly moby hack was published as
   "Reflections on Trusting Trust", "Communications of the ACM
   27", 8 (August 1984), pp. 761--763.  Ken Thompson has since
   confirmed that this hack was implemented and that the Trojan Horse
   code did appear in the login binary of a Unix Support group
   machine.  Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed.
   Your editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the
   crocked login did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and
   that it enabled at least one late-night login across the network by
   someone using the login name `kt'.

@{b}backbone cabal@{ub} n.  A group of large-site administrators who
   pushed through the @{"Great Renaming" LINK "jarg_G" 580} and reined in the chaos of
   @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190} during most of the 1980s.  The cabal @{"mailing list" LINK "jarg_M" 172}
   disbanded in late 1988 after a bitter internal catfight.

@{b}backbone site@{ub} n.  A key Usenet and email site; one that
   processes a large amount of third-party traffic, especially if it
   is the home site of any of the regional coordinators for the Usenet
   maps.  Notable backbone sites as of early 1993, when this sense of
   the term was beginning to pass out of general use due to wide
   availability of cheap Internet connections, included uunet and
   the mail machines at Rutgers University, UC Berkeley, @{"DEC" LINK "jarg_D" 246}'s
   Western Research Laboratories, Ohio State University, and the
   University of Texas.  Compare @{"rib site" LINK "jarg_R" 513}, @{"leaf site" LINK "jarg_L" 108}.

   [1996 update: This term is seldom heard any more.  The UUCP network
   world that gave it meaning has nearly disappeared; everyone is on
   the Internet now and network traffic is distributed in very
   different patterns. --ESR]

@{b}@{u}backgammon@{uu}@{ub}  See @{"bignum" LINK "jarg_B" 644} (sense 3), @{"moby" LINK "jarg_M" 780} (sense 4),
   and @{"pseudoprime" LINK "jarg_P" 1032}.

@{b}background@{ub} n.,adj.,vt.  To do a task `in background' is to
   do it whenever @{"foreground" LINK "jarg_F" 1023} matters are not claiming your
   undivided attention, and `to background' something means to
   relegate it to a lower priority.  "For now, we'll just print a
   list of nodes and links; I'm working on the graph-printing problem
   in background."  Note that this implies ongoing activity but at a
   reduced level or in spare time, in contrast to mainstream `back
   burner' (which connotes benign neglect until some future resumption
   of activity).  Some people prefer to use the term for processing
   that they have queued up for their unconscious minds (a tack that
   one can often fruitfully take upon encountering an obstacle in
   creative work).  Compare @{"amp off" LINK "jarg_A" 258}, @{"slopsucker" LINK "jarg_S" 911}.

   Technically, a task running in background is detached from the
   terminal where it was started (and often running at a lower
   priority); oppose @{"foreground" LINK "jarg_F" 1023}.  Nowadays this term is primarily
   associated with @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54}, but it appears to have been first used
   in this sense on OS/360.

@{b}backspace and overstrike@{ub} interj.  Whoa!  Back up.  Used to
   suggest that someone just said or did something wrong.  Common
   among APL programmers.

@{b}backward combatability@{ub} /bak'w*rd k*m-bat'*-bil'*-tee/ n. 
   [CMU, Tektronix: from `backward compatibility'] A property of
   hardware or software revisions in which previous protocols,
   formats, layouts, etc. are irrevocably discarded in favor of `new
   and improved' protocols, formats, and layouts, leaving the previous
   ones not merely deprecated but actively defeated.  (Too often, the
   old and new versions cannot definitively be distinguished, such
   that lingering instances of the previous ones yield crashes or
   other infelicitous effects, as opposed to a simple "version
   mismatch" message.)  A backwards compatible change, on the other
   hand, allows old versions to coexist without crashes or error
   messages, but too many major changes incorporating elaborate
   backwards compatibility processing can lead to extreme 
   @{"software bloat" LINK "jarg_S" 1223}.  See also @{"flag day" LINK "jarg_F" 576}.

@{b}BAD@{ub} /B-A-D/ adj.  [IBM: acronym, `Broken As Designed']
   Said of a program that is @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393} because of bad design and
   misfeatures rather than because of bugginess.  See 
   @{"working as designed" LINK "jarg_W" 667}.

@{b}Bad Thing@{ub} n.  [from the 1930 Sellar & Yeatman parody "1066
   And All That"] Something that can't possibly result in
   improvement of the subject.  This term is always capitalized, as in
   "Replacing all of the 9600-baud modems with bicycle couriers would
   be a Bad Thing".  Oppose @{"Good Thing" LINK "jarg_G" 480}.  British correspondents
   confirm that @{"Bad Thing" LINK "jarg_B" 110} and @{"Good Thing" LINK "jarg_G" 480} (and prob.
   therefore @{"Right Thing" LINK "jarg_R" 523} and @{"Wrong Thing" LINK "jarg_W" 745}) come from the book
   referenced in the etymology, which discusses rulers who were Good
   Kings but Bad Things.  This has apparently created a mainstream
   idiom on the British side of the pond.

@{b}bag on the side@{ub} n.  An extension to an established hack that
   is supposed to add some functionality to the original.  Usually
   derogatory, implying that the original was being overextended and
   should have been thrown away, and the new product is ugly,
   inelegant, or bloated.  Also v. phrase, `to hang a bag on the side
   [of]'.  "C++?  That's just a bag on the side of C ...."
   "They want me to hang a bag on the side of the accounting
   system."

@{b}bagbiter@{ub} /bag'bi:t-*r/ n.  1. Something, such as a program
   or a computer, that fails to work, or works in a remarkably clumsy
   manner.  "This text editor won't let me make a file with a line
   longer than 80 characters!  What a bagbiter!"  2. A person who has
   caused you some trouble, inadvertently or otherwise, typically by
   failing to program the computer properly.  Synonyms: @{"loser" LINK "jarg_L" 561},
   @{"cretin" LINK "jarg_C" 1429}, @{"chomper" LINK "jarg_C" 474}.  3. `bite the bag' vi. To fail in some
   manner.  "The computer keeps crashing every five minutes."
   "Yes, the disk controller is really biting the bag."  The
   original loading of these terms was almost undoubtedly obscene,
   possibly referring to the scrotum, but in their current usage they
   have become almost completely sanitized.

   ITS's @{"lexiphage" LINK "jarg_L" 188} program is the first and to date only known
   example of a program *intended* to be a bagbiter.

@{b}bagbiting@{ub} adj.  Having the quality of a @{"bagbiter" LINK "jarg_B" 130}.
   "This bagbiting system won't let me compute the factorial of a
   negative number."  Compare @{"losing" LINK "jarg_L" 568}, @{"cretinous" LINK "jarg_C" 1436},
   @{"bletcherous" LINK "jarg_B" 993}, `barfucious' (under @{"barfulous" LINK "jarg_B" 321}) and
   `chomping' (under @{"chomp" LINK "jarg_C" 455}).

@{b}balloonian variable@{ub} n.  [Commodore users; perh. a deliberate
   phonetic mangling of `boolean variable'?] Any variable that
   doesn't actually hold or control state, but must nevertheless be
   declared, checked, or set.  A typical balloonian variable started
   out as a flag attached to some environment feature that either
   became obsolete or was planned but never implemented.
   Compatibility concerns (or politics attached to same) may require
   that such a flag be treated as though it were live.

@{b}bamf@{ub} /bamf/  1. [from X-Men comics; originally "bampf"]
   interj. Notional sound made by a person or object teleporting in or
   out of the hearer's vicinity.  Often used in @{"virtual reality" LINK "jarg_V" 300}
   (esp. @{"MUD" LINK "jarg_M" 1065}) electronic @{"fora" LINK "jarg_F" 1021} when a character wishes to
   make a dramatic entrance or exit.  2. The sound of magical
   transformation, used in virtual reality @{"fora" LINK "jarg_F" 1021} like MUDs. 3. In
   MUD circles, "bamf" is also used to refer to the act by which a
   MUD server sends a special notification to the MUD client to switch
   its connection to another server ("I'll set up the old site to
   just bamf people over to our new location.").  4. Used by MUDders
   on occasion in a more general sense related to sense 3, to refer to
   directing someone to another location or resource ("A user was
   asking about some technobabble so I bamfed them to
   http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon.html.")

@{b}banana label@{ub} n.  The labels often used on the sides of
   @{"macrotape" LINK "jarg_M" 70} reels, so called because they are shaped roughly
   like blunt-ended bananas.  This term, like macrotapes themselves,
   is still current but visibly headed for obsolescence.

@{b}banana problem@{ub} n.  [from the story of the little girl who
   said "I know how to spell `banana', but I don't know when to
   stop"].  Not knowing where or when to bring a production to a
   close (compare @{"fencepost error" LINK "jarg_F" 319}).  One may say `there is a
   banana problem' of an algorithm with poorly defined or incorrect
   termination conditions, or in discussing the evolution of a design
   that may be succumbing to featuritis (see also @{"creeping elegance" LINK "jarg_C" 1395},
   @{"creeping featuritis" LINK "jarg_C" 1421}).  See item 176 under
   @{"HAKMEM" LINK "jarg_H" 269}, which describes a banana problem in a @{"Dissociated Press" LINK "jarg_D" 648}
   implementation.  Also, see @{"one-banana problem" LINK "jarg_O" 136} for a
   superficially similar but unrelated usage.

@{b}bandwidth@{ub} n.  1. Used by hackers (in a generalization of its
   technical meaning) as the volume of information per unit time that
   a computer, person, or transmission medium can handle.  "Those are
   amazing graphics, but I missed some of the detail -- not enough
   bandwidth, I guess."  Compare @{"low-bandwidth" LINK "jarg_L" 614}.  2. Attention
   span.  3. On @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190}, a measure of network capacity that is
   often wasted by people complaining about how items posted by others
   are a waste of bandwidth.

@{b}bang@{ub}  1. n. Common spoken name for `!' (ASCII 0100001),
   especially when used in pronouncing a @{"bang path" LINK "jarg_B" 223} in spoken
   hackish.  In @{"elder days" LINK "jarg_E" 102} this was considered a CMUish usage,
   with MIT and Stanford hackers preferring @{"excl" LINK "jarg_E" 468} or @{"shriek" LINK "jarg_S" 719};
   but the spread of Unix has carried `bang' with it (esp. via the
   term @{"bang path" LINK "jarg_B" 223}) and it is now certainly the most common spoken
   name for `!'.  Note that it is used exclusively for
   non-emphatic written `!'; one would not say "Congratulations
   bang" (except possibly for humorous purposes), but if one wanted
   to specify the exact characters `foo!' one would speak "Eff oh oh
   bang".  See @{"shriek" LINK "jarg_S" 719}, @{"ASCII" LINK "jarg_A" 413}.  2. interj. An exclamation
   signifying roughly "I have achieved enlightenment!", or "The
   dynamite has cleared out my brain!"  Often used to acknowledge
   that one has perpetrated a @{"thinko" LINK "jarg_T" 557} immediately after one has
   been called on it.

@{b}bang on@{ub} vt.  To stress-test a piece of hardware or software:
   "I banged on the new version of the simulator all day yesterday
   and it didn't crash once.  I guess it is ready for release."  The
   term @{"pound on" LINK "jarg_P" 835} is synonymous.

@{b}bang path@{ub} n.  An old-style UUCP electronic-mail address
   specifying hops to get from some assumed-reachable location to the
   addressee, so called because each @{"hop" LINK "jarg_H" 796} is signified by a
   @{"bang" LINK "jarg_B" 202} sign.  Thus, for example, the path
   ...!bigsite!foovax!barbox!me directs people to route their mail
   to machine bigsite (presumably a well-known location accessible
   to everybody) and from there through the machine foovax to the
   account of user me on barbox.

   In the bad old days of not so long ago, before autorouting mailers
   became commonplace, people often published compound bang addresses
   using the { } convention (see @{"glob" LINK "jarg_G" 334}) to give paths from
   *several* big machines, in the hopes that one's correspondent
   might be able to get mail to one of them reliably (example:
   ...!{seismo, ut-sally, ihnp4}!rice!beta!gamma!me).  Bang paths
   of 8 to 10 hops were not uncommon in 1981.  Late-night dial-up
   UUCP links would cause week-long transmission times.  Bang paths
   were often selected by both transmission time and reliability, as
   messages would often get lost.  See @{"Internet address" LINK "jarg_I" 348},
   @{"network, the" LINK "jarg_N" 330}, and @{"sitename" LINK "jarg_S" 829}.

@{b}banner@{ub} n.  1. The title page added to printouts by most
   print spoolers (see @{"spool" LINK "jarg_S" 1542}).  Typically includes user or
   account ID information in very large character-graphics capitals.
   Also called a `burst page', because it indicates where to burst
   (tear apart) fanfold paper to separate one user's printout from the
   next.  2. A similar printout generated (typically on multiple pages
   of fan-fold paper) from user-specified text, e.g., by a program
   such as Unix's `banner({1,6})'.  3. On interactive software,
   a first screen containing a logo and/or author credits and/or a
   copyright notice.

@{b}bar@{ub} /bar/ n.  1. The second @{"metasyntactic variable" LINK "jarg_M" 507},
   after @{"foo" LINK "jarg_F" 825} and before @{"baz" LINK "jarg_B" 405}.  "Suppose we have two
   functions: FOO and BAR.  FOO calls BAR...." 2. Often
   appended to @{"foo" LINK "jarg_F" 825} to produce @{"foobar" LINK "jarg_F" 899}.

@{b}bare metal@{ub} n.  1. New computer hardware, unadorned with such
   snares and delusions as an @{"operating system" LINK "jarg_O" 228}, an @{"HLL" LINK "jarg_H" 711}, or
   even assembler.  Commonly used in the phrase `programming on the
   bare metal', which refers to the arduous work of @{"bit bashing" LINK "jarg_B" 774}
   needed to create these basic tools for a new machine.  Real
   bare-metal programming involves things like building boot proms and
   BIOS chips, implementing basic monitors used to test device
   drivers, and writing the assemblers that will be used to write the
   compiler back ends that will give the new machine a real
   development environment.  2. `Programming on the bare metal' is
   also used to describe a style of @{"hand-hacking" LINK "jarg_H" 366} that relies on
   bit-level peculiarities of a particular hardware design, esp.
   tricks for speed and space optimization that rely on crocks such as
   overlapping instructions (or, as in the famous case described in
   @{"The Story of Mel, a Real Programmer" LINK "jarg_app" 460} (in Appendix A),
   interleaving of opcodes on a magnetic drum to minimize fetch delays
   due to the device's rotational latency).  This sort of thing has
   become less common as the relative costs of programming time and
   machine resources have changed, but is still found in heavily
   constrained environments such as industrial embedded systems, and
   in the code of hackers who just can't let go of that low-level
   control.  See @{"Real Programmer" LINK "jarg_R" 212}.

   In the world of personal computing, bare metal programming
   (especially in sense 1 but sometimes also in sense 2) is often
   considered a @{"Good Thing" LINK "jarg_G" 480}, or at least a necessary evil
   (because these machines have often been sufficiently slow and
   poorly designed to make it necessary; see @{"ill-behaved" LINK "jarg_I" 99}).
   There, the term usually refers to bypassing the BIOS or OS
   interface and writing the application to directly access device
   registers and machine addresses.  "To get 19.2 kilobaud on the
   serial port, you need to get down to the bare metal."  People who
   can do this sort of thing well are held in high regard.

@{b}barf@{ub} /barf/  [from mainstream slang meaning `vomit']
   1. interj.  Term of disgust.  This is the closest hackish
   equivalent of the Val\-speak "gag me with a spoon". (Like,
   euwww!)  See @{"bletch" LINK "jarg_B" 989}.  2. vi. To say "Barf!" or emit some
   similar expression of disgust.  "I showed him my latest hack and
   he barfed" means only that he complained about it, not that he
   literally vomited.  3. vi. To fail to work because of unacceptable
   input, perhaps with a suitable error message, perhaps not.
   Examples: "The division operation barfs if you try to divide by
   0."  (That is, the division operation checks for an attempt to
   divide by zero, and if one is encountered it causes the operation
   to fail in some unspecified, but generally obvious, manner.) "The
   text editor barfs if you try to read in a new file before writing
   out the old one."  See @{"choke" LINK "jarg_C" 447}, @{"gag" LINK "jarg_G" 24}.  In Commonwealth
   Hackish, `barf' is generally replaced by `puke' or `vom'.
   @{"barf" LINK "jarg_B" 294} is sometimes also used as a @{"metasyntactic variable" LINK "jarg_M" 507},
   like @{"foo" LINK "jarg_F" 825} or @{"bar" LINK "jarg_B" 255}.

@{b}barfmail@{ub} n.  Multiple @{"bounce message" LINK "jarg_B" 1553}s accumulating to
   the level of serious annoyance, or worse.  The sort of thing that
   happens when an inter-network mail gateway goes down or wonky.

@{b}barfulation@{ub} /bar`fyoo-lay'sh*n/ interj.  Variation of
   @{"barf" LINK "jarg_B" 294} used around the Stanford area.  An exclamation,
   expressing disgust.  On seeing some particularly bad code one might
   exclaim, "Barfulation!  Who wrote this, Quux?"

@{b}barfulous@{ub} /bar'fyoo-l*s/ adj.  (alt. `barfucious',
   /bar-fyoo-sh*s/) Said of something that would make anyone
   barf, if only for esthetic reasons.

@{b}barney@{ub} n.  In Commonwealth hackish, `barney' is to
   @{"fred" LINK "jarg_F" 1108} (sense #1) as @{"bar" LINK "jarg_B" 255} is to @{"foo" LINK "jarg_F" 825}.  That is, people
   who commonly use `fred' as their first metasyntactic variable
   will often use `barney' second.  The reference is, of course, to
   Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble in the Flintstones cartoons.

@{b}baroque@{ub} adj.  Feature-encrusted; complex; gaudy; verging on
   excessive.  Said of hardware or (esp.) software designs, this has
   many of the connotations of @{"elephantine" LINK "jarg_E" 120} or @{"monstrosity" LINK "jarg_M" 911}
   but is less extreme and not pejorative in itself.  "Metafont even
   has features to introduce random variations to its letterform
   output.  Now *that* is baroque!"  See also @{"rococo" LINK "jarg_R" 558}.

@{b}BASIC@{ub} n.  [acronym: Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic
   Instruction Code] A programming language, originally designed for
   Dartmouth's experimental timesharing system in the early 1960s,
   which has since become the leading cause of brain-damage in
   proto-hackers.  Edsger W. Dijkstra observed in "Selected
   Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective" that "It is
   practically impossible to teach good programming style to students
   that have had prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers
   they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.".  This
   is another case (like @{"Pascal" LINK "jarg_P" 89}) of the cascading lossage that
   happens when a language deliberately designed as an educational toy
   gets taken too seriously.  A novice can write short BASIC programs
   (on the order of 10--20 lines) very easily; writing anything longer
   (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make
   it harder to use more powerful languages well.  This wouldn't be so
   bad if historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end
   micros.  As it is, it ruins thousands of potential wizards a
   year.

   [1995: Some languages called `BASIC' aren't quite this nasty any
   more, having acquired Pascal- and C-like procedures and control
   structures and shed their line numbers. -- ESR]

@{b}batch@{ub} adj.  1. Non-interactive.  Hackers use this somewhat
   more loosely than the traditional technical definitions justify; in
   particular, switches on a normally interactive program that prepare
   it to receive non-interactive command input are often referred to
   as `batch mode' switches.  A `batch file' is a series of
   instructions written to be handed to an interactive program running
   in batch mode.  2. Performance of dreary tasks all at one sitting.
   "I finally sat down in batch mode and wrote out checks for all
   those bills; I guess they'll turn the electricity back on next
   week..." 3. `batching up': Accumulation of a number of small
   tasks that can be lumped together for greater efficiency.  "I'm
   batching up those letters to send sometime" "I'm batching up
   bottles to take to the recycling center."

@{b}bathtub curve@{ub} n.  Common term for the curve (resembling an
   end-to-end section of one of those claw-footed antique bathtubs)
   that describes the expected failure rate of electronics with time:
   initially high, dropping to near 0 for most of the system's
   lifetime, then rising again as it `tires out'.  See also
   @{"burn-in period" LINK "jarg_B" 2101}, @{"infant mortality" LINK "jarg_I" 227}.

@{b}baud@{ub} /bawd/  [simplified from its technical meaning]
   n. Bits per second.  Hence kilobaud or Kbaud, thousands of bits per
   second.  The technical meaning is `level transitions per
   second'; this coincides with bps only for two-level modulation with
   no framing or stop bits.  Most hackers are aware of these nuances
   but blithely ignore them.

   Historical note: `baud' was originally a unit of telegraph
   signalling speed, set at one pulse per second.  It was proposed at
   the International Telegraph Conference of 1927, and named after
   J.M.E.  Baudot (1845--1903), the French engineer who constructed
   the first successful teleprinter.

@{b}baud barf@{ub} /bawd barf/ n.  The garbage one gets on the
   monitor when using a modem connection with some protocol setting
   (esp. line speed) incorrect, or when someone picks up a voice
   extension on the same line, or when really bad line noise disrupts
   the connection.  Baud barf is not completely @{"random" LINK "jarg_R" 26}, by the
   way; hackers with a lot of serial-line experience can usually tell
   whether the device at the other end is expecting a higher or lower
   speed than the terminal is set to.  *Really* experienced ones
   can identify particular speeds.

@{b}baz@{ub} /baz/ n.  1. The third @{"metasyntactic variable" LINK "jarg_M" 507}
   "Suppose we have three functions: FOO, BAR, and BAZ.  FOO calls
   BAR, which calls BAZ...." (See also @{"fum" LINK "jarg_F" 1364}) 2. interj. A
   term of mild annoyance.  In this usage the term is often drawn out
   for 2 or 3 seconds, producing an effect not unlike the bleating of
   a sheep; /baaaaaaz/.  3. Occasionally appended to @{"foo" LINK "jarg_F" 825} to
   produce `foobaz'.

   Earlier versions of this lexicon derived `baz' as a Stanford
   corruption of @{"bar" LINK "jarg_B" 255}.  However, Pete Samson (compiler of the
   @{"TMRC" LINK "jarg_T" 766} lexicon) reports it was already current when he joined TMRC
   in 1958.  He says "It came from "Pogo".  Albert the Alligator,
   when vexed or outraged, would shout `Bazz Fazz!' or `Rowrbazzle!'
   The club layout was said to model the (mythical) New England
   counties of Rowrfolk and Bassex (Rowrbazzle mingled with
   (Norfolk/Suffolk/Middlesex/Essex)."

@{b}bboard@{ub} /bee'bord/ n.  [contraction of `bulletin board']
   1. Any electronic bulletin board; esp. used of @{"BBS" LINK "jarg_B" 439} systems
   running on personal micros, less frequently of a Usenet
   @{"newsgroup" LINK "jarg_N" 412} (in fact, use of this term for a newsgroup generally
   marks one either as a @{"newbie" LINK "jarg_N" 361} fresh in from the BBS world or as
   a real old-timer predating Usenet).  2. At CMU and other colleges
   with similar facilities, refers to campus-wide electronic bulletin
   boards.  3. The term `physical bboard' is sometimes used to refer
   to an old-fashioned, non-electronic cork-and-thumbtack memo board.
   At CMU, it refers to a particular one outside the CS Lounge.

   In either of senses 1 or 2, the term is usually prefixed by the
   name of the intended board (`the Moonlight Casino bboard' or
   `market bboard'); however, if the context is clear, the better-read
   bboards may be referred to by name alone, as in (at CMU) "Don't
   post for-sale ads on general".

@{b}BBS@{ub} /B-B-S/ n.  [abbreviation, `Bulletin Board System'] An
   electronic bulletin board system; that is, a message database where
   people can log in and leave broadcast messages for others grouped
   (typically) into @{"topic group" LINK "jarg_T" 879}s.  Thousands of local BBS systems
   are in operation throughout the U.S., typically run by amateurs for
   fun out of their homes on MS-DOS boxes with a single modem line
   each.  Fans of Usenet and Internet or the big commercial
   timesharing bboards such as CompuServe and GEnie tend to consider
   local BBSes the low-rent district of the hacker culture, but they
   serve a valuable function by knitting together lots of hackers and
   users in the personal-micro world who would otherwise be unable to
   exchange code at all.  See also @{"bboard" LINK "jarg_B" 422}.

@{b}beam@{ub} vt.  [from Star Trek Classic's "Beam me up, Scotty!"]
   To transfer @{"softcopy" LINK "jarg_S" 1219} of a file electronically; most often
   in combining forms such as `beam me a copy' or `beam that over
   to his site'.  Compare @{"blast" LINK "jarg_B" 980}, @{"snarf" LINK "jarg_S" 1135}, @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155}.

@{b}beanie key@{ub} n.  [Mac users] See @{"command key" LINK "jarg_C" 759}.

@{b}beep@{ub} n.,v.  Syn. @{"feep" LINK "jarg_F" 255}.  This term seems to be preferred
   among micro hobbyists.

@{b}beige toaster@{ub} n.  A Macintosh. See @{"toaster" LINK "jarg_T" 823}; compare
   @{"Macintrash" LINK "jarg_M" 24}, @{"maggotbox" LINK "jarg_M" 73}.

@{b}bells and whistles@{ub} n.  [by analogy with the toyboxes on theater
   organs] Features added to a program or system to make it more
   @{"flavorful" LINK "jarg_F" 707} from a hacker's point of view, without necessarily
   adding to its utility for its primary function.  Distinguished from
   @{"chrome" LINK "jarg_C" 489}, which is intended to attract users.  "Now that we've
   got the basic program working, let's go back and add some bells and
   whistles."  No one seems to know what distinguishes a bell from a
   whistle.

@{b}bells, whistles, and gongs@{ub} n.  A standard elaborated form of
   @{"bells and whistles" LINK "jarg_B" 465}; typically said with a pronounced and
   ironic accent on the `gongs'.

@{b}benchmark@{ub} [techspeak] n.  An inaccurate measure of computer
   performance.  "In the computer industry, there are three kinds of
   lies: lies, damn lies, and benchmarks."  Well-known ones include
   Whetstone, Dhrystone, Rhealstone (see @{"h" LINK "jarg_H" 1}), the Gabriel LISP
   benchmarks (see @{"gabriel" LINK "jarg_G" 17}), the SPECmark suite, and LINPACK.
   See also @{"machoflops" LINK "jarg_M" 15}, @{"MIPS" LINK "jarg_M" 718}, @{"smoke and mirrors" LINK "jarg_S" 980}.

@{b}Berkeley Quality Software@{ub} adj.  (often abbreviated `BQS')
   Term used in a pejorative sense to refer to software that was
   apparently created by rather spaced-out hackers late at night to
   solve some unique problem.  It usually has nonexistent, incomplete,
   or incorrect documentation, has been tested on at least two
   examples, and core dumps when anyone else attempts to use it.  This
   term was frequently applied to early versions of the `dbx(1)'
   debugger.  See also @{"Berzerkeley" LINK "jarg_B" 502}.

   Note to British and Commonwealth readers: that's /berk'lee/, not
   /bark'lee/ as in British Received Pronunciation.

@{b}berklix@{ub} /berk'liks/ n.,adj.  [contraction of `Berkeley
   Unix'] See @{"BSD" LINK "jarg_B" 1854}.  Not used at Berkeley itself.  May be more
   common among @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}s attempting to sound like cognoscenti than
   among hackers, who usually just say `BSD'.

@{b}Berzerkeley@{ub} /b*r-zer'klee/ n.  [from `berserk', via the
   name of a now-deceased record label] Humorous distortion of
   `Berkeley' used esp. to refer to the practices or products of the
   @{"BSD" LINK "jarg_B" 1854} Unix hackers.  See @{"software bloat" LINK "jarg_S" 1223},
   @{"Missed'em-five" LINK "jarg_M" 761}, @{"Berkeley Quality Software" LINK "jarg_B" 485}.

   Mainstream use of this term in reference to the cultural and
   political peculiarities of UC Berkeley as a whole has been reported
   from as far back as the 1960s.

@{b}beta@{ub} /bay't*/, /be't*/ or (Commonwealth) /bee't*/ n. 
   1. Mostly working, but still under test; usu. used with `in': `in
   beta'.  In the @{"Real World" LINK "jarg_R" 267}, systems (hardware or software)
   software often go through two stages of release testing: Alpha
   (in-house) and Beta (out-house?).  Beta releases are generally made
   to a small number of lucky (or unlucky), trusted customers.
   2. Anything that is new and experimental.  "His girlfriend is in
   beta" means that he is still testing for compatibility and
   reserving judgment.  3. Flaky; dubious; suspect (since beta
   software is notoriously buggy).

   Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a
   pre-release (potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software
   by making it available to selected customers and users.  This term
   derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints,
   first used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry.
   `Alpha Test' was the unit, module, or component test phase; `Beta
   Test' was initial system test.  These themselves came from earlier
   A- and B-tests for hardware.  The A-test was a feasibility and
   manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment to design
   and development.  The B-test was a demonstration that the
   engineering model functioned as specified.  The C-test
   (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early
   samples of the production design.

@{b}Big Gray Wall@{ub} n.  What faces a @{"VMS" LINK "jarg_V" 362} user searching for
   documentation.  A full VMS kit comes on a pallet, the documentation
   taking up around 15 feet of shelf space before the addition of
   layered products such as compilers, databases, multivendor
   networking, and programming tools.  Recent (since VMS version 5)
   DEC documentation comes with gray binders; under VMS version 4 the
   binders were orange (`big orange wall'), and under version 3 they
   were blue.  See @{"VMS" LINK "jarg_V" 362}.  Often contracted to `Gray Wall'.

@{b}Big Red Switch@{ub} n.  [IBM] The power switch on a computer,
   esp. the `Emergency Pull' switch on an IBM @{"mainframe" LINK "jarg_M" 210} or the
   power switch on an IBM PC where it really is large and red.  "This
   !@%$% @{"bitty box" LINK "jarg_B" 924} is hung again; time to hit the Big Red
   Switch."  Sources at IBM report that, in tune with the company's
   passion for @{"TLA" LINK "jarg_T" 747}s, this is often abbreviated as `BRS' (this
   has also become established on FidoNet and in the PC @{"clone" LINK "jarg_C" 565}
   world).  It is alleged that the emergency pull switch on an IBM
   360/91 actually fired a non-conducting bolt into the main power
   feed; the BRSes on more recent mainframes physically drop a block
   into place so that they can't be pushed back in.  People get fired
   for pulling them, especially inappropriately (see also
   @{"molly-guard" LINK "jarg_M" 889}).  Compare @{"power cycle" LINK "jarg_P" 837}, @{"three-finger salute" LINK "jarg_T" 596},

@{b}big-endian@{ub} adj.  [From Swift's "Gulliver's Travels" via
   the famous paper "On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace" by Danny
   Cohen, USC/ISI IEN 137, dated April 1, 1980] 1. Describes a
   computer architecture in which, within a given multi-byte numeric
   representation, the most significant byte has the lowest address
   (the word is stored `big-end-first').  Most processors,
   including the IBM 370 family, the @{"PDP-10" LINK "jarg_P" 264}, the Motorola
   microprocessor families, and most of the various RISC designs
   current in late 1995, are big-endian.  Big-endian byte order is
   also sometimes called `network order'. See @{"little-endian" LINK "jarg_L" 407},
   @{"middle-endian" LINK "jarg_M" 693}, @{"NUXI problem" LINK "jarg_N" 674}, @{"swab" LINK "jarg_S" 1857}.  2. An
   @{"Internet address" LINK "jarg_I" 348} the wrong way round.  Most of the world
   follows the Internet standard and writes email addresses starting
   with the name of the computer and ending up with the name of the
   country.  In the U.K. the Joint Networking Team had decided to do
   it the other way round before the Internet domain standard was
   established; e.g., me@as.pys.bris.ac.uk.  Most gateway sites have
   @{"ad-hockery" LINK "jarg_A" 69} in their mailers to handle this, but can still be
   confused.  In particular, the address above could be in the U.K.
   (domain uk) or the domain as (American Samoa) on the
   opposite side of the world.

@{b}bignum@{ub} /big'nuhm/ n.  [orig. from MIT MacLISP]
   1. [techspeak] A multiple-precision computer representation for
   very large integers.  2. More generally, any very large number.
   "Have you ever looked at the United States Budget?  There's
   bignums for you!"  3. [Stanford] In backgammon, large numbers on
   the dice especially a roll of double fives or double sixes (compare
   @{"moby" LINK "jarg_M" 780}, sense 4).  See also @{"El Camino Bignum" LINK "jarg_E" 75}.

   Sense 1 may require some explanation.  Most computer languages
   provide a kind of data called `integer', but such computer
   integers are usually very limited in size; usually they must be
   smaller than than 2^(31) (2,147,483,648) or (on a
   @{"bitty box" LINK "jarg_B" 924}) 2^(15) (32,768).  If you want to work
   with numbers larger than that, you have to use floating-point
   numbers, which are usually accurate to only six or seven decimal
   places.  Computer languages that provide bignums can perform exact
   calculations on very large numbers, such as 1000! (the factorial
   of 1000, which is 1000 times 999 times 998 times ... times 2
   times 1).  For example, this value for 1000!  was computed by the
   MacLISP system using bignums:

@{b}bigot@{ub} n.  A person who is religiously attached to a
   particular computer, language, operating system, editor, or other
   tool (see @{"religious issues" LINK "jarg_R" 388}).  Usually found with a specifier;
   thus, `cray bigot', `ITS bigot', `APL bigot', `VMS bigot',
   `Berkeley bigot'.  Real bigots can be distinguished from mere
   partisans or zealots by the fact that they refuse to learn
   alternatives even when the march of time and/or technology is
   threatening to obsolete the favored tool.  It is truly said "You
   can tell a bigot, but you can't tell him much."  Compare
   @{"weenie" LINK "jarg_W" 339}.

@{b}bit@{ub} n.  [from the mainstream meaning and `Binary digIT']
   1. [techspeak] The unit of information; the amount of information
   obtained by asking a yes-or-no question for which the two outcomes
   are equally probable.  2. [techspeak] A computational quantity that
   can take on one of two values, such as true and false or 0 and 1.
   3. A mental flag: a reminder that something should be done
   eventually.  "I have a bit set for you."  (I haven't seen you for
   a while, and I'm supposed to tell or ask you something.)  4. More
   generally, a (possibly incorrect) mental state of belief.  "I have
   a bit set that says that you were the last guy to hack on EMACS."
   (Meaning "I think you were the last guy to hack on EMACS, and what
   I am about to say is predicated on this, so please stop me if this
   isn't true.")

   "I just need one bit from you" is a polite way of indicating that
   you intend only a short interruption for a question that can
   presumably be answered yes or no.

   A bit is said to be `set' if its value is true or 1, and
   `reset' or `clear' if its value is false or 0.  One speaks of
   setting and clearing bits.  To @{"toggle" LINK "jarg_T" 837} or `invert' a bit is
   to change it, either from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.  See also
   @{"flag" LINK "jarg_F" 568}, @{"trit" LINK "jarg_T" 996}, @{"mode bit" LINK "jarg_M" 873}.

   The term `bit' first appeared in print in the computer-science
   sense in 1949, and seems to have been coined by early computer
   scientist John Tukey.  Tukey records that it evolved over a lunch
   table as a handier alternative to `bigit' or `binit'.

@{b}bit bang@{ub} n.  Transmission of data on a serial line, when
   accomplished by rapidly tweaking a single output bit, in software,
   at the appropriate times.  The technique is a simple loop with
   eight OUT and SHIFT instruction pairs for each byte.  Input is more
   interesting.  And full duplex (doing input and output at the same
   time) is one way to separate the real hackers from the
   @{"wannabee" LINK "jarg_W" 150}s.

   Bit bang was used on certain early models of Prime computers,
   presumably when UARTs were too expensive, and on archaic Z80 micros
   with a Zilog PIO but no SIO.  In an interesting instance of the
   @{"cycle of reincarnation" LINK "jarg_C" 1745}, this technique returned to use in the
   early 1990s on some RISC architectures because it consumes such
   an infinitesimal part of the processor that it actually makes sense
   not to have a UART.  Compare @{"cycle of reincarnation" LINK "jarg_C" 1745}.

@{b}bit bashing@{ub} n.  (alt. `bit diddling' or @{"bit twiddling" LINK "jarg_B" 844}) 
   Term used to describe any of several kinds of low-level
   programming characterized by manipulation of @{"bit" LINK "jarg_B" 729}, @{"flag" LINK "jarg_F" 568},
   @{"nybble" LINK "jarg_N" 681}, and other smaller-than-character-sized pieces of data;
   these include low-level device control, encryption algorithms,
   checksum and error-correcting codes, hash functions, some flavors
   of graphics programming (see @{"bitblt" LINK "jarg_B" 897}), and assembler/compiler
   code generation.  May connote either tedium or a real technical
   challenge (more usually the former).  "The command decoding for
   the new tape driver looks pretty solid but the bit-bashing for the
   control registers still has bugs."  See also @{"bit bang" LINK "jarg_B" 758},
   @{"mode bit" LINK "jarg_M" 873}.

@{b}bit bucket@{ub} n.  1. The universal data sink (originally, the
   mythical receptacle used to catch bits when they fall off the end
   of a register during a shift instruction).  Discarded, lost, or
   destroyed data is said to have `gone to the bit bucket'.  On
   @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54}, often used for @{"/dev/null" LINK "jarg_alph" 59}.  Sometimes amplified as
   `the Great Bit Bucket in the Sky'.  2. The place where all lost
   mail and news messages eventually go.  The selection is performed
   according to @{"Finagle's Law" LINK "jarg_F" 436}; important mail is much more likely
   to end up in the bit bucket than junk mail, which has an almost
   100% probability of getting delivered.  Routing to the bit bucket
   is automatically performed by mail-transfer agents, news systems,
   and the lower layers of the network.  3. The ideal location for all
   unwanted mail responses: "Flames about this article to the bit
   bucket."  Such a request is guaranteed to overflow one's mailbox
   with flames.  4. Excuse for all mail that has not been sent.  "I
   mailed you those figures last week; they must have landed in the
   bit bucket."  Compare @{"black hole" LINK "jarg_B" 950}.

   This term is used purely in jest.  It is based on the fanciful
   notion that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only
   misplaced.  This appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term
   `bit box', about which the same legend was current; old-time
   hackers also report that trainees used to be told that when the CPU
   stored bits into memory it was actually pulling them `out of the
   bit box'.  See also @{"chad box" LINK "jarg_C" 303}.

   Another variant of this legend has it that, as a consequence of the
   `parity preservation law', the number of 1 bits that go to the bit
   bucket must equal the number of 0 bits.  Any imbalance results in
   bits filling up the bit bucket.  A qualified computer technician
   can empty a full bit bucket as part of scheduled maintenance.

@{b}bit decay@{ub} n.  See @{"bit rot" LINK "jarg_B" 823}.  People with a physics
   background tend to prefer this variant for the analogy with
   particle decay.  See also @{"computron" LINK "jarg_C" 856}, @{"quantum bogodynamics" LINK "jarg_Q" 134}.

@{b}bit rot@{ub} n.  Also @{"bit decay" LINK "jarg_B" 819}.  Hypothetical disease the
   existence of which has been deduced from the observation that
   unused programs or features will often stop working after
   sufficient time has passed, even if `nothing has changed'.  The
   theory explains that bits decay as if they were radioactive.  As
   time passes, the contents of a file or the code in a program will
   become increasingly garbled.

   There actually are physical processes that produce such effects
   (alpha particles generated by trace radionuclides in ceramic chip
   packages, for example, can change the contents of a computer memory
   unpredictably, and various kinds of subtle media failures can
   corrupt files in mass storage), but they are quite rare (and
   computers are built with error-detecting circuitry to compensate
   for them).  The notion long favored among hackers that cosmic
   rays are among the causes of such events turns out to be a myth;
   see the @{"cosmic rays" LINK "jarg_C" 1184} entry for details.

   The term @{"software rot" LINK "jarg_S" 1246} is almost synonymous.  Software rot is
   the effect, bit rot the notional cause.

@{b}bit twiddling@{ub} n.  1. (pejorative) An exercise in tuning (see
   @{"tune" LINK "jarg_T" 1145}) in which incredible amounts of time and effort go to
   produce little noticeable improvement, often with the result that
   the code becomes incomprehensible.  2. Aimless small modification
   to a program, esp. for some pointless goal.  3. Approx. syn. for
   @{"bit bashing" LINK "jarg_B" 774}; esp. used for the act of frobbing the device
   control register of a peripheral in an attempt to get it back to a
   known state.

@{b}bit-paired keyboard@{ub} n. obs.  (alt. `bit-shift keyboard')
   A non-standard keyboard layout that seems to have originated with
   the Teletype ASR-33 and remained common for several years on early
   computer equipment.  The ASR-33 was a mechanical device (see
   @{"EOU" LINK "jarg_E" 345}), so the only way to generate the character codes from
   keystrokes was by some physical linkage.  The design of the ASR-33
   assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be modified
   by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed.  In
   order to avoid making the thing more of a Rube Goldberg kluge than
   it already was, the design had to group characters that shared the
   same basic bit pattern on one key.

   Looking at the ASCII chart, we find:

     high  low bits
     bits  0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001
      010        !    "    #    $    %    &    '    (    )
      011   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9

   This is why the characters !"#$%&'() appear where they do on a
   Teletype (thankfully, they didn't use shift-0 for space).  This was
   *not* the weirdest variant of the @{"QWERTY" LINK "jarg_Q" 229} layout widely
   seen, by the way; that prize should probably go to one of several
   (differing) arrangements on IBM's even clunkier 026 and 029 card
   punches.

   When electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there
   was no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be
   laid out.  Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard,
   while others used the flexibility of electronic circuitry to make
   their product look like an office typewriter.  These alternatives
   became known as `bit-paired' and `typewriter-paired' keyboards.  To
   a hacker, the bit-paired keyboard seemed far more logical -- and
   because most hackers in those days had never learned to touch-type,
   there was little pressure from the pioneering users to adapt
   keyboards to the typewriter standard.

   The doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale
   introduction of the computer terminal into the normal office
   environment, where out-and-out technophobes were expected to use
   the equipment.  The `typewriter-paired' standard became universal,
   `bit-paired' hardware was quickly junked or relegated to dusty
   corners, and both terms passed into disuse.

@{b}bitblt@{ub} /bit'blit/ n.  [from @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155}, q.v.] 1. Any of a
   family of closely related algorithms for moving and copying
   rectangles of bits between main and display memory on a bit-mapped
   device, or between two areas of either main or display memory (the
   requirement to do the @{"Right Thing" LINK "jarg_R" 523} in the case of overlapping
   source and destination rectangles is what makes BitBlt tricky).
   2. Synonym for @{"blit" LINK "jarg_B" 1060} or @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155}.  Both uses are borderline
   techspeak.

@{b}BITNET@{ub} /bit'net/ n.  [acronym: Because It's Time NETwork]
   Everybody's least favorite piece of the network (see @{"network, the" LINK "jarg_N" 330}).
   The BITNET hosts are a collection of IBM dinosaurs and
   VAXen (the latter with lobotomized comm hardware) that communicate
   using 80-character @{"EBCDIC" LINK "jarg_E" 36} card images (see @{"eighty-column mind" LINK "jarg_E" 56});
   thus, they tend to mangle the headers and text of
   third-party traffic from the rest of the ASCII/@{"RFC" LINK "jarg_R" 476}-822 world
   with annoying regularity.  BITNET was also notorious as the
   apparent home of @{"B1FF" LINK "jarg_B" 554}.

@{b}bits@{ub} n.pl.  1. Information.  Examples: "I need some bits
   about file formats."  ("I need to know about file formats.")
   Compare @{"core dump" LINK "jarg_C" 1156}, sense 4.  2. Machine-readable
   representation of a document, specifically as contrasted with
   paper: "I have only a photocopy of the Jargon File; does anyone
   know where I can get the bits?".  See @{"softcopy" LINK "jarg_S" 1219}, 
   @{"source of all good bits" LINK "jarg_S" 1319} See also @{"bit" LINK "jarg_B" 729}.

@{b}bitty box@{ub} /bit'ee boks/ n.  1. A computer sufficiently
   small, primitive, or incapable as to cause a hacker acute
   claustrophobia at the thought of developing software on or for it.
   Especially used of small, obsolescent, single-tasking-only personal
   machines such as the Atari 800, Osborne, Sinclair, VIC-20, TRS-80,
   or IBM PC.  2. [Pejorative] More generally, the opposite of
   `real computer' (see @{"Get a real computer!" LINK "jarg_G" 229}).  See also
   @{"mess-dos" LINK "jarg_M" 476}, @{"toaster" LINK "jarg_T" 823}, and @{"toy" LINK "jarg_T" 913}.

@{b}bixie@{ub} /bik'see/ n.  Variant @{"emoticon" LINK "jarg_E" 231}s used on BIX
   (the Byte Information eXchange).  The @{"smiley" LINK "jarg_S" 971} bixie is <@_@>,
   apparently intending to represent two cartoon eyes and a mouth.  A
   few others have been reported.

@{b}black art@{ub} n.  A collection of arcane, unpublished, and (by
   implication) mostly ad-hoc techniques developed for a particular
   application or systems area (compare @{"black magic" LINK "jarg_B" 959}).  VLSI
   design and compiler code optimization were (in their beginnings)
   considered classic examples of black art; as theory developed they
   became @{"deep magic" LINK "jarg_D" 309}, and once standard textbooks had been
   written, became merely @{"heavy wizardry" LINK "jarg_H" 558}.  The huge proliferation
   of formal and informal channels for spreading around new
   computer-related technologies during the last twenty years has made
   both the term `black art' and what it describes less common than
   formerly.  See also @{"voodoo programming" LINK "jarg_V" 390}.

@{b}black hole@{ub} n.  What a piece of email or netnews has fallen
   into if it disappears mysteriously between its origin and
   destination sites (that is, without returning a @{"bounce message" LINK "jarg_B" 1553}).
   "I think there's a black hole at foovax!" conveys
   suspicion that site foovax has been dropping a lot of stuff on
   the floor lately (see @{"drop on the floor" LINK "jarg_D" 1029}).  The implied
   metaphor of email as interstellar travel is interesting in itself.
   Compare @{"bit bucket" LINK "jarg_B" 787}.

@{b}black magic@{ub} n.  A technique that works, though nobody really
   understands why.  More obscure than @{"voodoo programming" LINK "jarg_V" 390}, which
   may be done by cookbook.  Compare also @{"black art" LINK "jarg_B" 938}, 
   @{"deep magic" LINK "jarg_D" 309}, and @{"magic number" LINK "jarg_M" 109} (sense 2).

@{b}blammo@{ub} v.  [Oxford Brookes University and alumni, UK] To
   forcibly remove someone from any interactive system, especially
   talker systems. The operators, who may remain hidden, may `blammo'
a
   user who is misbehaving.  Very similar to MIT @{"gun" LINK "jarg_G" 839}; in fact,
   the `blammo-gun' is a notional device used to `blammo' someone.
   While in actual fact the only incarnation of the blammo-gun is the
   command used to forcibly eject a user, operators speak of different
   levels of blammo-gun fire; e.g., a blammo-gun to `stun' will
   temporarily remove someone, but a blammo-gun set to `maim' will
   stop someone coming back on for a while.

@{b}blargh@{ub} /blarg/ n.  [MIT] The opposite of @{"ping" LINK "jarg_P" 503}, sense
   5; an exclamation indicating that one has absorbed or is emitting a
   quantum of unhappiness.  Less common than @{"ping" LINK "jarg_P" 503}.

@{b}blast@{ub} 1. vt.,n.  Synonym for @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155}, used esp. for large
   data sends over a network or comm line.  Opposite of @{"snarf" LINK "jarg_S" 1135}.
   Usage: uncommon.  The variant `blat' has been reported.  2. vt.
   [HP/Apollo] Synonymous with @{"nuke" LINK "jarg_N" 639} (sense 3).  Sometimes the
   message `Unable to kill all processes.  Blast them (y/n)?'
   would appear in the command window upon logout.

@{b}blat@{ub} n.  1. Syn. @{"blast" LINK "jarg_B" 980}, sense 1.  2. See @{"thud" LINK "jarg_T" 598}.

@{b}bletch@{ub} /blech/ interj.  [from Yiddish/German `brechen', to
   vomit, poss.  via comic-strip exclamation `blech'] Term
   of disgust.  Often used in "Ugh, bletch".  Compare @{"barf" LINK "jarg_B" 294}.

@{b}bletcherous@{ub} /blech'*-r*s/ adj.  Disgusting in design or
   function; esthetically unappealing.  This word is seldom used of
   people.  "This keyboard is bletcherous!" (Perhaps the keys don't
   work very well, or are misplaced.)  See @{"losing" LINK "jarg_L" 568},
   @{"cretinous" LINK "jarg_C" 1436}, @{"bagbiting" LINK "jarg_B" 146}, @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393}, and @{"random" LINK "jarg_R" 26}.  The
   term @{"bletcherous" LINK "jarg_B" 993} applies to the esthetics of the thing so
   described; similarly for @{"cretinous" LINK "jarg_C" 1436}.  By contrast, something
   that is `losing' or `bagbiting' may be failing to meet
   objective criteria.  See also @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393} and @{"random" LINK "jarg_R" 26}, which
   have richer and wider shades of meaning than any of the above.

@{b}blink@{ub} v.,n.  To use a navigator or off-line message reader
   to minimize time spent on-line to a commercial network service.
   As of late 1994, this term was said to be in wide use in the U.K.,
   but is rare or unknown in the US.

@{b}blinkenlights@{ub} /blink'*n-li:tz/ n.  Front-panel diagnostic
   lights on a computer, esp. a @{"dinosaur" LINK "jarg_D" 568}.  Derives from the
   last word of the famous blackletter-Gothic sign in mangled
   pseudo-German that once graced about half the computer rooms in the
   English-speaking world.  One version ran in its entirety as
   follows:

                   ACHTUNG!  ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS!  Das
     computermachine ist nicht fuer gefingerpoken und mittengrabben.
     Ist easy schnappen der springenwerk, blowenfusen und poppencorken
     mit spitzensparken.  Ist nicht fuer gewerken bei das dumpkopfen.
     Das rubbernecken sichtseeren keepen das cotten-pickenen hans in
     das pockets muss; relaxen und watchen das blinkenlichten.


   This silliness dates back at least as far as 1959 at Stanford
   University and had already gone international by the early 1960s,
   when it was reported at London University's ATLAS computing site.
   There are several variants of it in circulation, some of which
   actually do end with the word `blinkenlights'.

   In an amusing example of turnabout-is-fair-play, German hackers
   have developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster in
   fractured English, one of which is reproduced here:

                              ATTENTION


     This room is fullfilled mit special electronische equippment.
     Fingergrabbing and pressing the cnoeppkes from the computers is
     allowed for die experts only!  So all the "lefthanders" stay away
     and do not disturben the brainstorming von here working
     intelligencies.  Otherwise you will be out thrown and kicked
     anderswhere!  Also: please keep still and only watchen
     astaunished the blinkenlights.

   See also @{"geef" LINK "jarg_G" 145}.

   Old-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for blinkenlights because
   they were so much more fun to look at than a blank panel.  Sadly,
   very few computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard
   certainly don't count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost
   of front-panel cutouts, almost nobody needs or wants to interpret
   machine-register states on the fly anymore) are only part of the
   story.  Another part of it is that radio-frequency leakage from the
   lamp wiring was beginning to be a problem as far back as transistor
   machines.  But the most fundamental fact is that there are very few
   signals slow enough to blink an LED these days!  With slow CPUs,
   you could watch the bus register or instruction counter tick, but
   at 33/66/150MHz it's all a blur.

@{b}blit@{ub} /blit/ vt.  1. To copy a large array of bits from one
   part of a computer's memory to another part, particularly when the
   memory is being used to determine what is shown on a display
   screen.  "The storage allocator picks through the table and copies
   the good parts up into high memory, and then blits it all back down
   again."  See @{"bitblt" LINK "jarg_B" 897}, @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155}, @{"dd" LINK "jarg_D" 83}, @{"cat" LINK "jarg_C" 227}, @{"blast" LINK "jarg_B" 980},
   @{"snarf" LINK "jarg_S" 1135}.  More generally, to perform some operation (such as
   toggling) on a large array of bits while moving them.  2. Sometimes
   all-capitalized as `BLIT': an early experimental bit-mapped
   terminal designed by Rob Pike at Bell Labs, later commercialized as
   the AT&T 5620.  (The folk etymology from `Bell Labs Intelligent
   Terminal' is incorrect.  Its creators liked to claim that "Blit"
   stood for the Bacon, Lettuce, and Interactive Tomato.)

@{b}blitter@{ub} /blit'r/ n.  A special-purpose chip or hardware
   system built to perform @{"blit" LINK "jarg_B" 1060} operations, esp. used for fast
   implementation of bit-mapped graphics.  The Commodore Amiga and a
   few other micros have these, but sine 1990 the trend is away from
   them (however, see @{"cycle of reincarnation" LINK "jarg_C" 1745}).  Syn. @{"raster blaster" LINK "jarg_R" 108}.

@{b}blivet@{ub} /bliv'*t/ n.  [allegedly from a World War II
   military term meaning "ten pounds of manure in a five-pound bag"]
   1. An intractable problem.  2. A crucial piece of hardware that
   can't be fixed or replaced if it breaks.  3. A tool that has been
   hacked over by so many incompetent programmers that it has become
   an unmaintainable tissue of hacks.  4. An out-of-control but
   unkillable development effort.  5. An embarrassing bug that pops up
   during a customer demo.  6. In the subjargon of computer security
   specialists, a denial-of-service attack performed by hogging
   limited resources that have no access controls (for example, shared
   spool space on a multi-user system).

   This term has other meanings in other technical cultures; among
   experimental physicists and hardware engineers of various kinds it
   seems to mean any random object of unknown purpose (similar to
   hackish use of @{"frob" LINK "jarg_F" 1170}).  It has also been used to describe an
   amusing trick-the-eye drawing resembling a three-pronged fork that
   appears to depict a three-dimensional object until one realizes
   that the parts fit together in an impossible way.

@{b}BLOB@{ub}  1. n. [acronym: Binary Large OBject] Used by database
   people to refer to any random large block of bits that needs to be
   stored in a database, such as a picture or sound file.  The
   essential point about a BLOB is that it's an object that cannot be
   interpreted within the database itself.  2. v. To @{"mailbomb" LINK "jarg_M" 161}
   someone by sending a BLOB him/her; esp. used as a mild threat.
   "If that program crashes again, I'm going to BLOB the core dump to
   you."

@{b}block@{ub}  [from process scheduling terminology in OS theory]
   1. vi.  To delay or sit idle while waiting for something.  "We're
   blocking until everyone gets here."  Compare @{"busy-wait" LINK "jarg_B" 2113}.
   2. `block on' vt. To block, waiting for (something).  "Lunch is
   blocked on Phil's arrival."

@{b}block transfer computations@{ub} n.  [from the television series
   "Dr. Who"] Computations so fiendishly subtle and complex
   that they could not be performed by machines.  Used to refer to any
   task that should be expressible as an algorithm in theory, but
   isn't.

@{b}Bloggs Family, the@{ub} n.  An imaginary family consisting of
   Fred and Mary Bloggs and their children.  Used as a standard
   example in knowledge representation to show the difference between
   extensional and intensional objects.  For example, every occurrence
   of "Fred Bloggs" is the same unique person, whereas occurrences
   of "person" may refer to different people.  Members of the Bloggs
   family have been known to pop up in bizarre places such as the DEC
   Telephone Directory.  Compare @{"Mbogo, Dr. Fred" LINK "jarg_M" 374}.

@{b}blow an EPROM@{ub} /bloh *n ee'prom/ v.  (alt. `blast an
   EPROM', `burn an EPROM') To program a read-only memory, e.g.
   for use with an embedded system.  This term arose because the
   programming process for the Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs)
   that preceded present-day Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memories
   (EPROMs) involved intentionally blowing tiny electrical fuses on
   the chip.  The usage lives on (it's too vivid and expressive to
   discard) even though the write process on EPROMs is nondestructive.

@{b}blow away@{ub} vt.  To remove (files and directories) from
   permanent storage, generally by accident.  "He reformatted the
   wrong partition and blew away last night's netnews."  Oppose
   @{"nuke" LINK "jarg_N" 639}.

@{b}blow out@{ub} vi.  [prob. from mining and tunneling jargon] Of
   software, to fail spectacularly; almost as serious as 
   @{"crash and burn" LINK "jarg_C" 1322}.  See @{"blow past" LINK "jarg_B" 1148}, @{"blow up" LINK "jarg_B" 1151}, @{"die horribly" LINK "jarg_D" 521}.

@{b}blow past@{ub} vt.  To @{"blow out" LINK "jarg_B" 1144} despite a safeguard.  "The
   server blew past the 5K reserve buffer."

@{b}blow up@{ub} vi.  1. [scientific computation] To become unstable.
   Suggests that the computation is diverging so rapidly that it will
   soon overflow or at least go @{"nonlinear" LINK "jarg_N" 545}.  2.  Syn. @{"blow out" LINK "jarg_B" 1144}.

@{b}BLT@{ub} /B-L-T/, /bl*t/ or (rarely) /belt/ n.,vt.  Synonym
   for @{"blit" LINK "jarg_B" 1060}.  This is the original form of @{"blit" LINK "jarg_B" 1060} and the
   ancestor of @{"bitblt" LINK "jarg_B" 897}.  It referred to any large bit-field copy
   or move operation (one resource-intensive memory-shuffling
   operation done on pre-paged versions of ITS, WAITS, and TOPS-10 was
   sardonically referred to as `The Big BLT').  The jargon usage has
   outlasted the @{"PDP-10" LINK "jarg_P" 264} BLock Transfer instruction from which
   @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155} derives; nowadays, the assembler mnemonic @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155} almost
   always means `Branch if Less Than zero'.

@{b}Blue Book@{ub} n.  1. Informal name for one of the three standard
   references on the page-layout and graphics-control language
   @{"PostScript" LINK "jarg_P" 817} ("PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook",
   Adobe Systems, Addison-Wesley 1985, QA76.73.P67P68, ISBN
   0-201-10179-3); the other three official guides are known as the
   @{"Green Book" LINK "jarg_G" 632}, the @{"Red Book" LINK "jarg_R" 310}, and the @{"White Book" LINK "jarg_W" 449} (sense
   2).  2. Informal name for one of the three standard references on
   Smalltalk: "Smalltalk-80: The Language and its
   Implementation", David Robson, Addison-Wesley 1983, QA76.8.S635G64,
   ISBN 0-201-11371-63 (this book also has green and red siblings).
   3. Any of the 1988 standards issued by the CCITT's ninth plenary
   assembly.  These include, among other things, the X.400 email spec
   and the Group 1 through 4 fax standards.  See also @{"book titles" LINK "jarg_B" 1461}.

@{b}blue box@{ub}  n. 1. obs. Once upon a time, before all-digital switches
   made it possible for the phone companies to move them out of the
   audible range, one could actually hear the switching tones used to
   route long-distance calls.  Early @{"phreaker" LINK "jarg_P" 458}s built devices
   called `blue boxes' that could reproduce these tones, which could
   be used to commandeer portions of the phone network.  (This was not
   as hard as it may sound; one early phreak acquired the sobriquet
   `Captain Crunch' after he proved that he could generate switching
   tones with a plastic whistle pulled out of a box of Captain Crunch
   cereal!) 2. n. An @{"IBM" LINK "jarg_I" 21} machine, especially a large (non-PC)
   one.

@{b}Blue Glue@{ub} n.  [IBM] IBM's SNA (Systems Network
   Architecture), an incredibly @{"losing" LINK "jarg_L" 568} and @{"bletcherous" LINK "jarg_B" 993}
   communications protocol widely favored at commercial shops that
   don't know any better.  The official IBM definition is "that which
   binds blue boxes together."  See @{"fear and loathing" LINK "jarg_F" 143}.  It may
   not be irrelevant that @{"Blue Glue" LINK "jarg_B" 1191} is the trade name of a 3M
   product that is commonly used to hold down the carpet squares to
   the removable panel floors common in @{"dinosaur pen" LINK "jarg_D" 577}s.  A
   correspondent at U. Minn. reports that the CS department there has
   about 80 bottles of the stuff hanging about, so they often refer to
   any messy work to be done as `using the blue glue'.

@{b}blue goo@{ub} n.  Term for `police' @{"nanobot" LINK "jarg_N" 92}s intended to
   prevent @{"gray goo" LINK "jarg_G" 571}, denature hazardous waste, destroy pollution,
   put ozone back into the stratosphere, prevent halitosis, and
   promote truth, justice, and the American way, etc.  The term
   `Blue Goo' can be found in Dr. Seuss's "Fox In Socks" to
   refer to a substance much like bubblegum.  `Would you like to
   chew blue goo, sir?'.  See @{"nanotechnology" LINK "jarg_N" 108}.

@{b}blue wire@{ub} n.  [IBM] Patch wires added to circuit boards at
   the factory to correct design or fabrication problems.  These may
   be necessary if there hasn't been time to design and qualify
   another board version.  Compare @{"purple wire" LINK "jarg_P" 1118}, @{"red wire" LINK "jarg_R" 330},
   @{"yellow wire" LINK "jarg_Y" 43}.

@{b}blurgle@{ub} /bler'gl/ n.  [UK] Spoken @{"metasyntactic variable" LINK "jarg_M" 507}, to 
   indicate some text that is obvious from context, or
   which is already known. If several words are to be replaced,
   blurgle may well be doubled or trebled. "To look for something in
   several files use `grep string blurgle blurgle'."  In each case,
   "blurgle blurgle" would be understood to be replaced by the file
   you wished to search.  Compare @{"mumble" LINK "jarg_M" 1175}, sense 7.

@{b}BNF@{ub} /B-N-F/ n.  1. [techspeak] Acronym for `Backus-Naur
   Form', a metasyntactic notation used to specify the syntax of
   programming languages, command sets, and the like.  Widely used for
   language descriptions but seldom documented anywhere, so that it
   must usually be learned by osmosis from other hackers.  Consider
   this BNF for a U.S. postal address:

      <postal-address> ::= <name-part> <street-address> <zip-part>

      <personal-part> ::= <name> | <initial> "."

      <name-part> ::= <personal-part> <last-name> [<jr-part>] <EOL>
                    | <personal-part> <name-part>

      <street-address> ::= [<apt>] <house-num> <street-name> <EOL>

      <zip-part> ::= <town-name> "," <state-code> <ZIP-code> <EOL>

   This translates into English as: "A postal-address consists of a
   name-part, followed by a street-address part, followed by a
   zip-code part.  A personal-part consists of either a first name or
   an initial followed by a dot.  A name-part consists of either: a
   personal-part followed by a last name followed by an optional
   `jr-part' (Jr., Sr., or dynastic number) and end-of-line, or a
   personal part followed by a name part (this rule illustrates the
   use of recursion in BNFs, covering the case of people who use
   multiple first and middle names and/or initials).  A street address
   consists of an optional apartment specifier, followed by a street
   number, followed by a street name.  A zip-part consists of a
   town-name, followed by a comma, followed by a state code, followed
   by a ZIP-code followed by an end-of-line."  Note that many things
   (such as the format of a personal-part, apartment specifier, or
   ZIP-code) are left unspecified.  These are presumed to be obvious
   from context or detailed somewhere nearby.  See also @{"parse" LINK "jarg_P" 77}.
   2. Any of a number number of variants and extensions of BNF proper,
   possibly containing some or all of the @{"regexp" LINK "jarg_R" 336} wildcards such
   as `*' or `+'.  In fact the example above isn't the pure
   form invented for the Algol-60 report; it uses `[]', which was
   introduced a few years later in IBM's PL/I definition but is now
   universally recognized.  3. In @{"science-fiction fandom" LINK "jarg_S" 320}, a
   `Big-Name Fan' (someone famous or notorious).  Years ago a fan
   started handing out black-on-green BNF buttons at SF conventions;
   this confused the hacker contingent terribly.

@{b}boa@{ub} [IBM] n.  Any one of the fat cables that lurk under the
   floor in a @{"dinosaur pen" LINK "jarg_D" 577}.  Possibly so called because they
   display a ferocious life of their own when you try to lay them
   straight and flat after they have been coiled for some time.  It is
   rumored within IBM that channel cables for the 370 are limited to
   200 feet because beyond that length the boas get dangerous -- and
   it is worth noting that one of the major cable makers uses the
   trademark `Anaconda'.

@{b}board@{ub} n.  1. In-context synonym for @{"bboard" LINK "jarg_B" 422}; sometimes
   used even for Usenet newsgroups (but see usage note under
   @{"bboard" LINK "jarg_B" 422}, sense 1).  2. An electronic circuit board.

@{b}boat anchor@{ub} n.  1. Like @{"doorstop" LINK "jarg_D" 812} but more severe;
   implies that the offending hardware is irreversibly dead or
   useless.  "That was a working motherboard once.  One lightning
   strike later, instant boat anchor!"  2. A person who just takes up
   space.  3. Obsolete but still working hardware, especially
   when used of an old S100-bus hobbyist system; originally a term of
   annoyance, but became more and more affectionate as the hardware
   became more and more obsolete.

@{b}bodysurf code@{ub} n  A program or segment of code written
   quickly in the heat of inspiration without the benefit of formal
   design or deep thought.  Like its namesake sport, the result is
   too often a wipeout that leaves the programmer eating sand.

@{b}BOF@{ub} /B-O-F/ or /bof/ n.  Abbreviation for the phrase
   "Birds Of a Feather" (flocking together), an informal discussion
   group and/or bull session scheduled on a conference program.  It is
   not clear where or when this term originated, but it is now
   associated with the USENIX conferences for Unix techies and was
   already established there by 1984.  It was used earlier than that
   at DECUS conferences and is reported to have been common at SHARE
   meetings as far back as the early 1960s.

@{b}bogo-sort@{ub} /boh`goh-sort'/ n.  (var. `stupid-sort') The
   archetypical perversely awful algorithm (as opposed to 
   @{"bubble sort" LINK "jarg_B" 1882}, which is merely the generic *bad* algorithm).
   Bogo-sort is equivalent to repeatedly throwing a deck of cards in
   the air, picking them up at random, and then testing whether they
   are in order.  It serves as a sort of canonical example of
   awfulness.  Looking at a program and seeing a dumb algorithm, one
   might say "Oh, I see, this program uses bogo-sort."  Compare
   @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393}, @{"brute force" LINK "jarg_B" 1795}, @{"Lasherism" LINK "jarg_L" 91}.

@{b}bogometer@{ub} /boh-gom'-*t-er/ n.  A notional instrument for
   measuring @{"bogosity" LINK "jarg_B" 1365}.  Compare the `wankometer' described in
   the @{"wank" LINK "jarg_W" 134} entry; see also @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393}.

@{b}bogon@{ub} /boh'gon/ n.  [by analogy with
   proton/electron/neutron, but doubtless reinforced after 1980 by the
   similarity to Douglas Adams's `Vogons'; see the @{"Bibliography" LINK "jarg_app" 1109}
   in Appendix C and note that Arthur Dent actually mispronounces
   `Vogons' as `Bogons' at one point] 1. The elementary particle of
   bogosity (see @{"quantum bogodynamics" LINK "jarg_Q" 134}).  For instance, "the
   Ethernet is emitting bogons again" means that it is broken or
   acting in an erratic or bogus fashion.  2. A query packet sent from
   a TCP/IP domain resolver to a root server, having the reply bit set
   instead of the query bit.  3. Any bogus or incorrectly formed
   packet sent on a network.  4. By synecdoche, used to refer to any
   bogus thing, as in "I'd like to go to lunch with you but I've got
   to go to the weekly staff bogon".  5. A person who is bogus or
   who says bogus things.  This was historically the original usage,
   but has been overtaken by its derivative senses 1--4.  See also
   @{"bogosity" LINK "jarg_B" 1365}, @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393}; compare @{"psyton" LINK "jarg_P" 1054}, @{"fat electrons" LINK "jarg_F" 119},
   @{"magic smoke" LINK "jarg_M" 138}.

   The bogon has become the type case for a whole bestiary of nonce
   particle names, including the `clutron' or `cluon' (indivisible
   particle of cluefulness, obviously the antiparticle of the bogon)
   and the futon (elementary particle of @{"randomness" LINK "jarg_R" 80}, or sometimes
   of lameness).  These are not so much live usages in themselves as
   examples of a live meta-usage: that is, it has become a standard
   joke or linguistic maneuver to "explain" otherwise mysterious
   circumstances by inventing nonce particle names.  And these imply
   nonce particle theories, with all their dignity or lack thereof (we
   might note parenthetically that this is a generalization from
   "(bogus particle) theories" to "bogus (particle theories)"!).
   Perhaps such particles are the modern-day equivalents of trolls and
   wood-nymphs as standard starting-points around which to construct
   explanatory myths.  Of course, playing on an existing word (as in
   the `futon') yields additional flavor.  Compare @{"magic smoke" LINK "jarg_M" 138}.

@{b}bogon filter@{ub} /boh'gon fil'tr/ n.  Any device, software or
   hardware, that limits or suppresses the flow and/or emission of
   bogons.  "Engineering hacked a bogon filter between the Cray and
   the VAXen, and now we're getting fewer dropped packets."  See also
   @{"bogosity" LINK "jarg_B" 1365}, @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393}.

@{b}bogon flux@{ub} /boh'gon fluhks/ n.  A measure of a supposed
   field of @{"bogosity" LINK "jarg_B" 1365} emitted by a speaker, measured by a
   @{"bogometer" LINK "jarg_B" 1315}; as a speaker starts to wander into increasing
   bogosity a listener might say "Warning, warning, bogon flux is
   rising".  See @{"quantum bogodynamics" LINK "jarg_Q" 134}.

@{b}bogosity@{ub} /boh-go's*-tee/ n.  1. The degree to which
   something is @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393}.  At CMU, bogosity is measured with a
   @{"bogometer" LINK "jarg_B" 1315}; in a seminar, when a speaker says something bogus,
   a listener might raise his hand and say "My bogometer just
   triggered".  More extremely, "You just pinned my bogometer"
   means you just said or did something so outrageously bogus that it
   is off the scale, pinning the bogometer needle at the highest
   possible reading (one might also say "You just redlined my
   bogometer").  The agreed-upon unit of bogosity is the
   @{"microLenat" LINK "jarg_M" 654}.  2. The potential field generated by a @{"bogon flux" LINK "jarg_B" 1359};
   see @{"quantum bogodynamics" LINK "jarg_Q" 134}.  See also @{"bogon flux" LINK "jarg_B" 1359},
   @{"bogon filter" LINK "jarg_B" 1353}, @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393}.

@{b}bogotify@{ub} /boh-go't*-fi:/ vt.  To make or become bogus.  A
   program that has been changed so many times as to become completely
   disorganized has become bogotified.  If you tighten a nut too hard
   and strip the threads on the bolt, the bolt has become bogotified
   and you had better not use it any more.  This coinage led to the
   notional `autobogotiphobia' defined as `the fear of becoming
   bogotified'; but is not clear that the latter has ever been
   `live' jargon rather than a self-conscious joke in jargon about
   jargon.  See also @{"bogosity" LINK "jarg_B" 1365}, @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393}.

@{b}bogue out@{ub} /bohg owt/ vi.  To become bogus, suddenly and
   unexpectedly.  "His talk was relatively sane until somebody asked
   him a trick question; then he bogued out and did nothing but
   @{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600} afterwards."  See also @{"bogosity" LINK "jarg_B" 1365}, @{"bogus" LINK "jarg_B" 1393}.

@{b}bogus@{ub} adj.  1. Non-functional.  "Your patches are bogus."
   2. Useless.  "OPCON is a bogus program."  3. False.  "Your
   arguments are bogus."  4. Incorrect.  "That algorithm is bogus."
   5. Unbelievable.  "You claim to have solved the halting problem
   for Turing Machines?  That's totally bogus."  6. Silly.  "Stop
   writing those bogus sagas."

   Astrology is bogus.  So is a bolt that is obviously about to break.
   So is someone who makes blatantly false claims to have solved a
   scientific problem.  (This word seems to have some, but not all, of
   the connotations of @{"random" LINK "jarg_R" 26} -- mostly the negative ones.)

   It is claimed that `bogus' was originally used in the hackish sense
   at Princeton in the late 1960s.  It was spread to CMU and Yale by
   Michael Shamos, a migratory Princeton alumnus.  A glossary of bogus
   words was compiled at Yale when the word was first popularized (see
   @{"autobogotiphobia" LINK "jarg_A" 726} under @{"bogotify" LINK "jarg_B" 1378}). The word spread into
   hackerdom from CMU and MIT.  By the early 1980s it was also
   current in something like the hackish sense in West Coast teen
   slang, and it had gone mainstream by 1985.  A correspondent from
   Cambridge reports, by contrast, that these uses of `bogus' grate on
   British nerves; in Britain the word means, rather specifically,
   `counterfeit', as in "a bogus 10-pound note".

@{b}Bohr bug@{ub} /bohr buhg/ n.  [from quantum physics] A repeatable
   @{"bug" LINK "jarg_B" 1939}; one that manifests reliably under a possibly unknown but
   well-defined set of conditions.  Antonym of @{"heisenbug" LINK "jarg_H" 579}; see also
   @{"mandelbug" LINK "jarg_M" 241}, @{"schroedinbug" LINK "jarg_S" 310}.

@{b}boink@{ub} /boynk/  [Usenet: variously ascribed to the TV
   series "Cheers" "Moonlighting", and "Soap"] 1. To
   have sex with; compare @{"bounce" LINK "jarg_B" 1532}, sense 3. (This is mainstream
   slang.) In Commonwealth hackish the variant `bonk' is more
   common.  2. After the original Peter Korn `Boinkon' @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190}
   parties, used for almost any net social gathering, e.g., Miniboink,
   a small boink held by Nancy Gillett in 1988; Minniboink, a Boinkcon
   in Minnesota in 1989; Humpdayboinks, Wednesday get-togethers held
   in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Compare @{"@-party" LINK "jarg_alph" 101}.  3. Var of
   `bonk'; see @{"bonk/oif" LINK "jarg_B" 1453}.

@{b}bomb@{ub}  1. v. General synonym for @{"crash" LINK "jarg_C" 1306} (sense 1) except
   that it is not used as a noun; esp. used of software or OS
   failures.  "Don't run Empire with less than 32K stack, it'll
   bomb."  2. n.,v. Atari ST and Macintosh equivalents of a Unix
   `panic' or Amiga @{"guru" LINK "jarg_G" 852} (sense 2), in which icons of little
   black-powder bombs or mushroom clouds are displayed, indicating
   that the system has died.  On the Mac, this may be accompanied by a
   decimal (or occasionally hexadecimal) number indicating what went
   wrong, similar to the Amiga @{"guru meditation" LINK "jarg_G" 857} number.
   @{"MS-DOS" LINK "jarg_M" 1016} machines tend to get @{"locked up" LINK "jarg_L" 489} in this situation.

@{b}bondage-and-discipline language@{ub}  A language (such as
   @{"Pascal" LINK "jarg_P" 89}, @{"Ada" LINK "jarg_A" 81}, APL, or Prolog) that, though ostensibly
   general-purpose, is designed so as to enforce an author's theory of
   `right programming' even though said theory is demonstrably
   inadequate for systems hacking or even vanilla general-purpose
   programming.  Often abbreviated `B&D'; thus, one may speak of
   things "having the B&D nature".  See @{"Pascal" LINK "jarg_P" 89}; oppose
   @{"languages of choice" LINK "jarg_L" 37}.

@{b}bonk/oif@{ub} /bonk/, /oyf/ interj.  In the @{"MUD" LINK "jarg_M" 1065}
   community, it has become traditional to express pique or censure by
   `bonking' the offending person.  Convention holds that one should
   acknowledge a bonk by saying `oif!' and there is a myth to the
   effect that failing to do so upsets the cosmic bonk/oif balance,
   causing much trouble in the universe.  Some MUDs have implemented
   special commands for bonking and oifing.  See also @{"talk mode" LINK "jarg_T" 19}.

@{b}@{u}book titles@{uu}@{ub}  There is a tradition in hackerdom of
   informally tagging important textbooks and standards documents with
   the dominant color of their covers or with some other conspicuous
   feature of the cover.  Many of these are described in this lexicon
   under their own entries. See @{"Aluminum Book" LINK "jarg_A" 249}, @{"Blue Book" LINK "jarg_B" 1165},
   @{"Camel Book" LINK "jarg_C" 36}, @{"Cinderella Book" LINK "jarg_C" 509}, @{"Devil Book" LINK "jarg_D" 489}, @{"Dragon Book" LINK "jarg_D" 947},
   @{"Green Book" LINK "jarg_G" 632}, @{"Orange Book" LINK "jarg_O" 261}, @{"Pink-Shirt Book" LINK "jarg_P" 541},
   @{"Purple Book" LINK "jarg_P" 1112}, @{"Red Book" LINK "jarg_R" 310}, @{"Silver Book" LINK "jarg_S" 819}, @{"White Book" LINK "jarg_W" 449},
   @{"Wizard Book" LINK "jarg_W" 603}, @{"Yellow Book" LINK "jarg_Y" 34}, and @{"bible" LINK "jarg_B" 542}; see also
   @{"rainbow series" LINK "jarg_R" 17}.  Since about 1983 this tradition has gotten a
   boost from the popular O'Reilly Associates line of technical books,
   which usually feature some kind of exotic animal on the
   cover.

@{b}boot@{ub} v.,n.  [techspeak; from `by one's bootstraps'] To
   load and initialize the operating system on a machine.  This usage
   is no longer jargon (having passed into techspeak) but has given
   rise to some derivatives that are still jargon.

   The derivative `reboot' implies that the machine hasn't been down
   for long, or that the boot is a @{"bounce" LINK "jarg_B" 1532} (sense 4) intended to
   clear some state of @{"wedgitude" LINK "jarg_W" 324}.  This is sometimes used of
   human thought processes, as in the following exchange: "You've
   lost me."  "OK, reboot.  Here's the theory...."

   This term is also found in the variants `cold boot' (from
   power-off condition) and `warm boot' (with the CPU and all
   devices already powered up, as after a hardware reset or software
   crash).

   Another variant: `soft boot', reinitialization of only part of a
   system, under control of other software still running: "If
   you're running the @{"mess-dos" LINK "jarg_M" 476} emulator, control-alt-insert will
   cause a soft-boot of the emulator, while leaving the rest of the
   system running."

   Opposed to this there is `hard boot', which connotes hostility
   towards or frustration with the machine being booted: "I'll have
   to hard-boot this losing Sun."  "I recommend booting it
   hard."  One often hard-boots by performing a @{"power cycle" LINK "jarg_P" 837}.

   Historical note: this term derives from `bootstrap loader', a short
   program that was read in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in
   from the front panel switches.  This program was always very short
   (great efforts were expended on making it short in order to
   minimize the labor and chance of error involved in toggling it in),
   but was just smart enough to read in a slightly more complex
   program (usually from a card or paper tape reader), to which it
   handed control; this program in turn was smart enough to read the
   application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk
   drive.  Thus, in successive steps, the computer `pulled itself up
   by its bootstraps' to a useful operating state.  Nowadays the
   bootstrap is usually found in ROM or EPROM, and reads the first
   stage in from a fixed location on the disk, called the `boot
   block'.  When this program gains control, it is powerful enough to
   load the actual OS and hand control over to it.

@{b}bottom feeder@{ub} n.  Syn. for @{"slopsucker" LINK "jarg_S" 911}, derived from the
   fishermen's and naturalists' term for finny creatures who subsist
   on the primordial ooze.

@{b}bottom-up implementation@{ub} n.  Hackish opposite of the
   techspeak term `top-down design'.  It is now received wisdom in
   most programming cultures that it is best to design from higher
   levels of abstraction down to lower, specifying sequences of action
   in increasing detail until you get to actual code.  Hackers often
   find (especially in exploratory designs that cannot be closely
   specified in advance) that it works best to *build* things in
   the opposite order, by writing and testing a clean set of primitive
   operations and then knitting them together.

@{b}bounce@{ub} v.  1. [perhaps by analogy to a bouncing check] An
   electronic mail message that is undeliverable and returns an error
   notification to the sender is said to `bounce'.  See also
   @{"bounce message" LINK "jarg_B" 1553}.  2. [Stanford] To play volleyball.  The
   now-demolished @{"D. C. Power Lab" LINK "jarg_D" 1} building used by the Stanford
   AI Lab in the 1970s had a volleyball court on the front lawn.  From
   5 P.M. to 7 P.M. was the scheduled maintenance time for the
   computer, so every afternoon at 5 would come over the intercom the
   cry: "Now hear this: bounce, bounce!", followed by Brian McCune
   loudly bouncing a volleyball on the floor outside the offices of
   known volleyballers.  3. To engage in sexual intercourse; prob.
   from the expression `bouncing the mattress', but influenced by
   Roo's psychosexually loaded "Try bouncing me, Tigger!" from the
   "Winnie-the-Pooh" books.  Compare @{"boink" LINK "jarg_B" 1422}.  4. To casually
   reboot a system in order to clear up a transient problem.  Reported
   primarily among @{"VMS" LINK "jarg_V" 362} users.  5.  [VM/CMS programmers]
   *Automatic* warm-start of a machine after an error.  "I
   logged on this morning and found it had bounced 7 times during the
   night" 6. [IBM] To @{"power cycle" LINK "jarg_P" 837} a peripheral in order to reset
   it.

@{b}bounce message@{ub} n.  [Unix] Notification message returned to sender
   by a site unable to relay @{"email" LINK "jarg_E" 211} to the intended @{"Internet address" LINK "jarg_I" 348}
   recipient or the next link in a @{"bang path" LINK "jarg_B" 223} (see
   @{"bounce" LINK "jarg_B" 1532}, sense 1).  Reasons might include a nonexistent or
   misspelled username or a @{"down" LINK "jarg_D" 890} relay site.  Bounce messages can
   themselves fail, with occasionally ugly results; see 
   @{"sorcerer's apprentice mode" LINK "jarg_S" 1296} and @{"software laser" LINK "jarg_S" 1234}.  The terms 
   `bounce mail' and `barfmail' are also common.

@{b}boustrophedon@{ub} n.  [from a Greek word for turning like an ox
   while plowing] An ancient method of writing using alternate
   left-to-right and right-to-left lines.  This term is actually
   philologists' techspeak and typesetters' jargon.  Erudite hackers
   use it for an optimization performed by some computer typesetting
   software and moving-head printers.  The adverbial form
   `boustrophedonically' is also found (hackers purely love
   constructions like this).

@{b}box@{ub} n.  1. A computer; esp. in the construction `foo
   box' where foo is some functional qualifier, like
   `graphics', or the name of an OS (thus, `Unix box', `MS-DOS
   box', etc.)  "We preprocess the data on Unix boxes before handing
   it up to the mainframe."  2. [IBM] Without qualification but
   within an SNA-using site, this refers specifically to an IBM
   front-end processor or FEP /F-E-P/.  An FEP is a small computer
   necessary to enable an IBM @{"mainframe" LINK "jarg_M" 210} to communicate beyond the
   limits of the @{"dinosaur pen" LINK "jarg_D" 577}.  Typically used in expressions
   like the cry that goes up when an SNA network goes down: "Looks
   like the @{"box" LINK "jarg_B" 1571} has fallen over." (See @{"fall over" LINK "jarg_F" 7}.) See also
   @{"IBM" LINK "jarg_I" 21}, @{"fear and loathing" LINK "jarg_F" 143}, @{"fepped out" LINK "jarg_F" 342}, @{"Blue Glue" LINK "jarg_B" 1191}.

@{b}boxed comments@{ub} n.  Comments (explanatory notes attached to
   program instructions) that occupy several lines by themselves; so
   called because in assembler and C code they are often surrounded by
   a box in a style something like this:

     /*************************************************
      *
      * This is a boxed comment in C style
      *
      *************************************************/

   Common variants of this style omit the asterisks in column 2 or add
   a matching row of asterisks closing the right side of the box.  The
   sparest variant omits all but the comment delimiters themselves;
   the `box' is implied.  Oppose @{"winged comments" LINK "jarg_W" 536}.

@{b}boxen@{ub} /bok'sn/ pl.n.  [by analogy with @{"VAXen" LINK "jarg_V" 97}]
   Fanciful plural of @{"box" LINK "jarg_B" 1571} often encountered in the phrase `Unix
   boxen', used to describe commodity @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54} hardware.  The
   connotation is that any two Unix boxen are interchangeable.

@{b}boxology@{ub} /bok-sol'*-jee/ n.  Syn. @{"ASCII art" LINK "jarg_A" 622}.  This
   term implies a more restricted domain, that of box-and-arrow
   drawings.  "His report has a lot of boxology in it."  Compare
   @{"macrology" LINK "jarg_M" 62}.

@{b}bozotic@{ub} /boh-zoh'tik/ or /boh-zo'tik/ adj.  [from the name of
   a TV clown even more losing than Ronald McDonald] Resembling
   or having the quality of a bozo; that is, clownish, ludicrously
   wrong, unintentionally humorous.  Compare @{"wonky" LINK "jarg_W" 639},
   @{"demented" LINK "jarg_D" 378}.  Note that the noun `bozo' occurs in slang, but
   the mainstream adjectival form would be `bozo-like' or (in New
   England) `bozoish'.

@{b}BQS@{ub} /B-Q-S/ adj.  Syn. @{"Berkeley Quality Software" LINK "jarg_B" 485}.

@{b}brain dump@{ub} n.  The act of telling someone everything one
   knows about a particular topic or project.  Typically used when
   someone is going to let a new party maintain a piece of code.
   Conceptually analogous to an operating system @{"core dump" LINK "jarg_C" 1156} in
   that it saves a lot of useful @{"state" LINK "jarg_S" 1620} before an exit.  "You'll
   have to give me a brain dump on FOOBAR before you start your new
   job at HackerCorp."  See @{"core dump" LINK "jarg_C" 1156} (sense 4).  At Sun, this
   is also known as `TOI' (transfer of information).

@{b}brain fart@{ub} n.  The actual result of a @{"braino" LINK "jarg_B" 1652}, as
   opposed to the mental glitch that is the braino itself.  E.g.,
   typing `dir' on a Unix box after a session with DOS.

@{b}brain-damaged@{ub} 1.  [generalization of `Honeywell Brain
   Damage' (HBD), a theoretical disease invented to explain certain
   utter cretinisms in Honeywell @{"Multics" LINK "jarg_M" 1145}] adj. Obviously wrong;
   @{"cretinous" LINK "jarg_C" 1436}; @{"demented" LINK "jarg_D" 378}.  There is an implication that the
   person responsible must have suffered brain damage, because he
   should have known better.  Calling something brain-damaged is
   really bad; it also implies it is unusable, and that its failure to
   work is due to poor design rather than some accident.  "Only six
   monocase characters per file name?  Now *that's*
   brain-damaged!"  2. [esp. in the Mac world] May refer to free
   demonstration software that has been deliberately crippled in some
   way so as not to compete with the commercial product it is intended
   to sell.  Syn.  @{"crippleware" LINK "jarg_C" 1442}.

@{b}brain-dead@{ub} adj.  Brain-damaged in the extreme.  It tends to
   imply terminal design failure rather than malfunction or simple
   stupidity.  "This comm program doesn't know how to send a break
   -- how brain-dead!"

@{b}braino@{ub} /bray'no/ n.  Syn. for @{"thinko" LINK "jarg_T" 557}. See also
   @{"brain fart" LINK "jarg_B" 1629}.

@{b}branch to Fishkill@{ub} n.  [IBM: from the location of one of the
   corporation's facilities] Any unexpected jump in a program that
   produces catastrophic or just plain weird results.  See 
   @{"jump off into never-never land" LINK "jarg_J" 145}, @{"hyperspace" LINK "jarg_H" 947}.

@{b}bread crumbs@{ub} n.  Debugging statements inserted into a
   program that emit output or log indicators of the program's
   @{"state" LINK "jarg_S" 1620} to a file so you can see where it dies or pin down the
   cause of surprising behavior. The term is probably a reference to
   the Hansel and Gretel story from the Brothers Grimm; in several
   variants, a character leaves a trail of bread crumbs so as not to
   get lost in the woods.

@{b}break@{ub}  1. vt. To cause to be @{"broken" LINK "jarg_B" 1746} (in any sense).
   "Your latest patch to the editor broke the paragraph commands."
   2. v.  (of a program) To stop temporarily, so that it may debugged.
   The place where it stops is a `breakpoint'.  3. [techspeak]
   vi. To send an RS-232 break (two character widths of line high)
   over a serial comm line.  4. [Unix] vi. To strike whatever key
   currently causes the tty driver to send SIGINT to the current
   process.  Normally, break (sense 3), delete or @{"control-C" LINK "jarg_C" 1002} does
   this.  5. `break break' may be said to interrupt a conversation
   (this is an example of verb doubling).  This usage comes from radio
   communications, which in turn probably came from landline
   telegraph/teleprinter usage, as badly abused in the Citizen's Band
   craze a few years ago.

@{b}break-even point@{ub} n.  In the process of implementing a new
   computer language, the point at which the language is sufficiently
   effective that one can implement the language in itself.  That is,
   for a new language called, hypothetically, FOOGOL, one has reached
   break-even when one can write a demonstration compiler for FOOGOL
   in FOOGOL, discard the original implementation language, and
   thereafter use working versions of FOOGOL to develop newer ones.
   This is an important milestone; see @{"MFTL" LINK "jarg_M" 566}.

   Since this entry was first written, several correspondents have
   reported that there actually was a compiler for a tiny Algol-like
   language called Foogol floating around on various @{"VAXen" LINK "jarg_V" 97} in the
   early and mid-1980s.

@{b}breath-of-life packet@{ub} n.  [XEROX PARC] An Ethernet packet
   that contains bootstrap (see @{"boot" LINK "jarg_B" 1475}) code, periodically sent out
   from a working computer to infuse the `breath of life' into any
   computer on the network that has happened to crash.  Machines
   depending on such packets have sufficient hardware or firmware code
   to wait for (or request) such a packet during the reboot process.
   See also @{"dickless workstation" LINK "jarg_D" 495}.

   The notional `kiss-of-death packet', with a function
   complementary to that of a breath-of-life packet, is recommended
   for dealing with hosts that consume too many network resources.
   Though `kiss-of-death packet' is usually used in jest, there is
   at least one documented instance of an Internet subnet with limited
   address-table slots in a gateway machine in which such packets were
   routinely used to compete for slots, rather like Christmas shoppers
   competing for scarce parking spaces.

@{b}breedle@{ub} n.  See @{"feep" LINK "jarg_F" 255}.

@{b}bring X to its knees@{ub} v.  To present a machine, operating
   system, piece of software, or algorithm with a load so extreme or
   @{"pathological" LINK "jarg_P" 203} that it grinds to a halt. "To bring a MicroVAX
   to its knees, try twenty users running @{"vi" LINK "jarg_V" 248} -- or four running
   @{"EMACS" LINK "jarg_E" 185}."  Compare @{"hog" LINK "jarg_H" 727}.

@{b}brittle@{ub} adj.  Said of software that is functional but easily
   broken by changes in operating environment or configuration, or by
   any minor tweak to the software itself.  Also, any system that
   responds inappropriately and disastrously to abnormal but expected
   external stimuli; e.g., a file system that is usually totally
   scrambled by a power failure is said to be brittle.  This term is
   often used to describe the results of a research effort that were
   never intended to be robust, but it can be applied to commercially
   developed software, which displays the quality far more often than
   it ought to.  Oppose @{"robust" LINK "jarg_R" 551}.

@{b}broadcast storm@{ub} n.  An incorrect packet broadcast on a
   network that causes most hosts to respond all at once, typically
   with wrong answers that start the process over again.  See
   @{"network meltdown" LINK "jarg_N" 315}; compare @{"mail storm" LINK "jarg_M" 156}.

@{b}brochureware@{ub} n.  Planned but non-existent product like
   @{"vaporware" LINK "jarg_V" 53}, but with the added implication that marketing is
   actively selling and promoting it (they've printed brochures).
   Brochureware is often deployed as a strategic weapon; the idea is
   to con customers into not committing to an existing product of the
   competition's.  It is a safe bet that when a brochureware product
   finally becomes real, it will be more expensive than and inferior
   to the alternatives that had been available for years.

@{b}broken@{ub} adj.  1. Not working properly (of programs).
   2. Behaving strangely; especially (when used of people) exhibiting
   extreme depression.

@{b}broken arrow@{ub} n.  [IBM] The error code displayed on line 25
   of a 3270 terminal (or a PC emulating a 3270) for various kinds of
   protocol violations and "unexpected" error conditions (including
   connection to a @{"down" LINK "jarg_D" 890} computer).  On a PC, simulated with
   `->/_', with the two center characters overstruck.

   Note: to appreciate this term fully, it helps to know that `broken
   arrow' is also military jargon for an accident involving nuclear
   weapons....

@{b}broket@{ub} /broh'k*t/ or /broh'ket`/ n.  [by analogy with
   `bracket': a `broken bracket'] Either of the characters
   `<' and `>', when used as paired enclosing delimiters.
   This word originated as a contraction of the phrase `broken
   bracket', that is, a bracket that is bent in the middle.  (At MIT,
   and apparently in the @{"Real World" LINK "jarg_R" 267} as well, these are usually
   called @{"angle brackets" LINK "jarg_A" 264}.)

@{b}Brooks's Law@{ub} prov.  "Adding manpower to a late software
   project makes it later" -- a result of the fact that the expected
   advantage from splitting work among N programmers is
   O(N) (that is, proportional to N), but the complexity
   and communications cost associated with coordinating and then
   merging their work is O(N^2) (that is, proportional to the
   square of N).  The quote is from Fred Brooks, a manager of
   IBM's OS/360 project and author of "The Mythical Man-Month"
   (Addison-Wesley, 1975, ISBN 0-201-00650-2), an excellent early book
   on software engineering.  The myth in question has been most
   tersely expressed as "Programmer time is fungible" and Brooks
   established conclusively that it is not.  Hackers have never
   forgotten his advice; too often, @{"management" LINK "jarg_M" 232} still does.  See
   also @{"creationism" LINK "jarg_C" 1380}, @{"second-system effect" LINK "jarg_S" 462}, @{"optimism" LINK "jarg_O" 244}.

@{b}browser@{ub}   A program specifically designed to help users view
   and navigate hypertext, on-line documentation, or a database.
   While this general sense has been present in jargon for a long
   time, the proliferation of browsers for the World Wide Web after
   1992 has made it much more popular and provided a central or
   default meaning of the word previously lacking in hacker usage.
   Nowadays, if someone mentions using a `browser' without
   qualification, one may assume it is a Web browser.

@{b}BRS@{ub} /B-R-S/ n.  Syn. @{"Big Red Switch" LINK "jarg_B" 596}.  This
   abbreviation is fairly common on-line.

@{b}brute force@{ub} adj.  Describes a primitive programming style,
   one in which the programmer relies on the computer's processing
   power instead of using his or her own intelligence to simplify the
   problem, often ignoring problems of scale and applying naive
   methods suited to small problems directly to large ones.  The term
   can also be used in reference to programming style: brute-force
   programs are written in a heavyhanded, tedious way, full of
   repetition and devoid of any elegance or useful abstraction (see
   also @{"brute force and ignorance" LINK "jarg_B" 1845}).

   The @{"canonical" LINK "jarg_C" 89} example of a brute-force algorithm is associated
   with the `traveling salesman problem' (TSP), a classical
   @{"NP-" LINK "jarg_N" 579}hard problem: Suppose a person is in, say, Boston, and
   wishes to drive to N other cities.  In what order should the
   cities be visited in order to minimize the distance travelled?  The
   brute-force method is to simply generate all possible routes and
   compare the distances; while guaranteed to work and simple to
   implement, this algorithm is clearly very stupid in that it
   considers even obviously absurd routes (like going from Boston to
   Houston via San Francisco and New York, in that order).  For very
   small N it works well, but it rapidly becomes absurdly
   inefficient when N increases (for N = 15, there are
   already 1,307,674,368,000 possible routes to consider, and for
   N = 1000 -- well, see @{"bignum" LINK "jarg_B" 644}).  Sometimes,
   unfortunately, there is no better general solution than brute
   force.  See also @{"NP-" LINK "jarg_N" 579}.

   A more simple-minded example of brute-force programming is finding
   the smallest number in a large list by first using an existing
   program to sort the list in ascending order, and then picking the
   first number off the front.

   Whether brute-force programming should actually be considered
   stupid or not depends on the context; if the problem is not
   terribly big, the extra CPU time spent on a brute-force solution
   may cost less than the programmer time it would take to develop a
   more `intelligent' algorithm.  Additionally, a more intelligent
   algorithm may imply more long-term complexity cost and bug-chasing
   than are justified by the speed improvement.

   Ken Thompson, co-inventor of Unix, is reported to have uttered the
   epigram "When in doubt, use brute force".  He probably intended
   this as a @{"ha ha only serious" LINK "jarg_H" 14}, but the original Unix kernel's
   preference for simple, robust, and portable algorithms over
   @{"brittle" LINK "jarg_B" 1721} `smart' ones does seem to have been a significant
   factor in the success of that OS.  Like so many other tradeoffs in
   software design, the choice between brute force and complex,
   finely-tuned cleverness is often a difficult one that requires both
   engineering savvy and delicate esthetic judgment.

@{b}brute force and ignorance@{ub} n.  A popular design technique at
   many software houses -- @{"brute force" LINK "jarg_B" 1795} coding unrelieved by any
   knowledge of how problems have been previously solved in elegant
   ways.  Dogmatic adherence to design methodologies tends to
   encourage this sort of thing.  Characteristic of early @{"larval stage" LINK "jarg_L" 61}
   programming; unfortunately, many never outgrow it.  Often
   abbreviated BFI: "Gak, they used a @{"bubble sort" LINK "jarg_B" 1882}!  That's
   strictly from BFI."  Compare @{"bogosity" LINK "jarg_B" 1365}.

@{b}BSD@{ub} /B-S-D/ n.  [abbreviation for `Berkeley Software
   Distribution'] a family of @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54} versions for the @{"DEC" LINK "jarg_D" 246}
   @{"VAX" LINK "jarg_V" 60} and PDP-11 developed by Bill Joy and others at
   @{"Berzerkeley" LINK "jarg_B" 502} starting around 1980, incorporating paged virtual
   memory, TCP/IP networking enhancements, and many other features.
   The BSD versions (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) and the commercial versions
   derived from them (SunOS, ULTRIX, and Mt. Xinu) held the technical
   lead in the Unix world until AT&T's successful standardization
   efforts after about 1986, and are still widely popular.  Note that
   BSD versions going back to 2.9 are often referred to by their
   version numbers, without the BSD prefix.  See @{"4.2" LINK "jarg_alph" 6}, @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54},
   @{"USG Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 242}.

@{b}BUAF@{ub} // n.  [abbreviation, from alt.fan.warlord] Big
   Ugly ASCII Font -- a special form of @{"ASCII art" LINK "jarg_A" 622}.  Various
   programs exist for rendering text strings into block, bloob, and
   pseudo-script fonts in cells between four and six character cells
   on a side; this is smaller than the letters generated by older
   @{"banner" LINK "jarg_B" 244} (sense 2) programs.  These are sometimes used to render
   one's name in a @{"sig block" LINK "jarg_S" 767}, and are critically referred to as
   `BUAF's.  See @{"warlording" LINK "jarg_W" 242}.

@{b}BUAG@{ub} // n.  [abbreviation, from alt.fan.warlord] Big
   Ugly ASCII Graphic.  Pejorative term for ugly @{"ASCII art" LINK "jarg_A" 622},
   especially as found in @{"sig block" LINK "jarg_S" 767}s.  For some reason, mutations
   of the head of Bart Simpson are particularly common in the least
   imaginative @{"sig block" LINK "jarg_S" 767}s.  See @{"warlording" LINK "jarg_W" 242}.

@{b}bubble sort@{ub} n.  Techspeak for a particular sorting technique
   in which pairs of adjacent values in the list to be sorted are
   compared and interchanged if they are out of order; thus, list
   entries `bubble upward' in the list until they bump into one
   with a lower sort value.  Because it is not very good relative to
   other methods and is the one typically stumbled on by @{"naive" LINK "jarg_N" 46}
   and untutored programmers, hackers consider it the @{"canonical" LINK "jarg_C" 89}
   example of a naive algorithm.  The canonical example of a really
   *bad* algorithm is @{"bogo-sort" LINK "jarg_B" 1305}.  A bubble sort might be
   used out of ignorance, but any use of bogo-sort could issue only
   from brain damage or willful perversity.

@{b}bucky bits@{ub} /buh'kee bits/ n.  1. obs. The bits produced by
   the CONTROL and META shift keys on a SAIL keyboard (octal 200 and
   400 respectively), resulting in a 9-bit keyboard character set.
   The MIT AI TV (Knight) keyboards extended this with TOP and
   separate left and right CONTROL and META keys, resulting in a
   12-bit character set; later, LISP Machines added such keys as
   SUPER, HYPER, and GREEK (see @{"space-cadet keyboard" LINK "jarg_S" 1325}).  2. By
   extension, bits associated with `extra' shift keys on any
   keyboard, e.g., the ALT on an IBM PC or command and option keys on
   a Macintosh.

   It has long been rumored that `bucky bits' were named for
   Buckminster Fuller during a period when he was consulting at
   Stanford.  Actually, bucky bits were invented by Niklaus Wirth when
   *he* was at Stanford in 1964--65; he first suggested the idea
   of an EDIT key to set the 8th bit of an otherwise 7-bit ASCII
   character).  It seems that, unknown to Wirth, certain Stanford
   hackers had privately nicknamed him `Bucky' after a prominent
   portion of his dental anatomy, and this nickname transferred to the
   bit.  Bucky-bit commands were used in a number of editors written
   at Stanford, including most notably TV-EDIT and NLS.

   The term spread to MIT and CMU early and is now in general use.
   Ironically, Wirth himself remained unaware of its derivation for
   nearly 30 years, until GLS dug up this history in early 1993!  See
   @{"double bucky" LINK "jarg_D" 830}, @{"quadruple bucky" LINK "jarg_Q" 8}.

@{b}buffer chuck@{ub} n.  Shorter and ruder syn. for @{"buffer overflow" LINK "jarg_B" 1923}.

@{b}buffer overflow@{ub} n.  What happens when you try to stuff more
   data into a buffer (holding area) than it can handle.  This may be
   due to a mismatch in the processing rates of the producing and
   consuming processes (see @{"overrun" LINK "jarg_O" 369} and @{"firehose syndrome" LINK "jarg_F" 501}),
   or because the buffer is simply too small to hold all the data that
   must accumulate before a piece of it can be processed.  For
   example, in a text-processing tool that @{"crunch" LINK "jarg_C" 1556}es a line at a
   time, a short line buffer can result in @{"lossage" LINK "jarg_L" 580} as input from
   a long line overflows the buffer and trashes data beyond it.  Good
   defensive programming would check for overflow on each character
   and stop accepting data when the buffer is full up.  The term is
   used of and by humans in a metaphorical sense.  "What time did I
   agree to meet you?  My buffer must have overflowed."  Or "If I
   answer that phone my buffer is going to overflow."  See also
   @{"spam" LINK "jarg_S" 1403}, @{"overrun screw" LINK "jarg_O" 383}.

@{b}bug@{ub} n.  An unwanted and unintended property of a program or
   piece of hardware, esp. one that causes it to malfunction.
   Antonym of @{"feature" LINK "jarg_F" 151}.  Examples: "There's a bug in the editor:
   it writes things out backwards."  "The system crashed because of
   a hardware bug."  "Fred is a winner, but he has a few bugs"
   (i.e., Fred is a good guy, but he has a few personality problems).

   Historical note: Admiral Grace Hopper (an early computing pioneer
   better known for inventing @{"COBOL" LINK "jarg_C" 592}) liked to tell a story in
   which a technician solved a @{"glitch" LINK "jarg_G" 311} in the Harvard Mark II
   machine by pulling an actual insect out from between the contacts
   of one of its relays, and she subsequently promulgated @{"bug" LINK "jarg_B" 1939} in
   its hackish sense as a joke about the incident (though, as she was
   careful to admit, she was not there when it happened).  For many
   years the logbook associated with the incident and the actual bug
   in question (a moth) sat in a display case at the Naval Surface
   Warfare Center (NSWC).  The entire story, with a picture of the
   logbook and the moth taped into it, is recorded in the "Annals
   of the History of Computing", Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981),
   pp. 285--286.

   The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads "1545
   Relay #70 Panel F (moth) in relay.  First actual case of bug being
   found".  This wording establishes that the term was already
   in use at the time in its current specific sense -- and Hopper
   herself reports that the term `bug' was regularly applied to
   problems in radar electronics during WWII.

   Indeed, the use of `bug' to mean an industrial defect was already
   established in Thomas Edison's time, and a more specific and rather
   modern use can be found in an electrical handbook from 1896
   ("Hawkin's New Catechism of Electricity", Theo. Audel & Co.)
   which says: "The term `bug' is used to a limited extent to
   designate any fault or trouble in the connections or working of
   electric apparatus."  It further notes that the term is "said to
   have originated in quadruplex telegraphy and have been transferred
   to all electric apparatus."

   The latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the
   term; that it came from telephone company usage, in which "bugs in
   a telephone cable" were blamed for noisy lines.  Though this
   derivation seems to be mistaken, it may well be a distorted memory
   of a joke first current among *telegraph* operators more than
   a century ago!

   Or perhaps not a joke.  Historians of the field inform us that the
   term "bug" was regularly used in the early days of telegraphy to
   refer to a variety of semi-automatic telegraphy keyers that would
   send a string of dots if you held them down.  In fact, the
   Vibroplex keyers (which were among the most common of this type)
   even had a graphic of a beetle on them!  While the ability to send
   repeated dots automatically was very useful for professional morse
   code operators, these were also significantly trickier to use than
   the older manual keyers, and it could take some practice to ensure
   one didn't introduce extraneous dots into the code by holding the
   key down a fraction too long.  In the hands of an inexperienced
   operator, a Vibroplex "bug" on the line could mean that a lot
   of garbled Morse would soon be coming your way.

   Actually, use of `bug' in the general sense of a disruptive event
   goes back to Shakespeare!  In the first edition of Samuel Johnson's
   dictionary one meaning of `bug' is "A frightful object; a
   walking spectre"; this is traced to `bugbear', a Welsh term for
   a variety of mythological monster which (to complete the circle)
   has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon through
   fantasy role-playing games.

   In any case, in jargon the word almost never refers to insects.
   Here is a plausible conversation that never actually happened:

   "There is a bug in this ant farm!"

   "What do you mean?  I don't see any ants in it."

   "That's the bug."

   A careful discussion of the etymological issues can be found in a
   paper by Fred R. Shapiro, 1987, "Entomology of the Computer Bug:
   History and Folklore", American Speech 62(4):376-378.

   [There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved
   to the Smithsonian, and an earlier version of this entry so
   asserted.  A correspondent who thought to check discovered that the
   bug was not there.  While investigating this in late 1990, your
   editor discovered that the NSWC still had the bug, but had
   unsuccessfully tried to get the Smithsonian to accept it -- and
   that the present curator of their History of American Technology
   Museum didn't know this and agreed that it would make a worthwhile
   exhibit.  It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid-1991, but due to
   space and money constraints has not yet been exhibited.  Thus, the
   process of investigating the original-computer-bug bug fixed it in
   an entirely unexpected way, by making the myth true!  -- ESR]

@{b}bug-compatible@{ub} adj.  Said of a design or revision that has
   been badly compromised by a requirement to be compatible with
   @{"fossil" LINK "jarg_F" 1071}s or @{"misfeature" LINK "jarg_M" 740}s in other programs or (esp.)
   previous releases of itself. "MS-DOS 2.0 used \ as a path
   separator to be bug-compatible with some cretin's choice of / as an
   option character in 1.0."

@{b}bug-for-bug compatible@{ub} n.  Same as @{"bug-compatible" LINK "jarg_B" 2032}, with
   the additional implication that much tedious effort went into
   ensuring that each (known) bug was replicated.

@{b}bug-of-the-month club@{ub} n.  A mythical club which users of
   @{"sendmail" LINK "jarg_S" 570} belong to; this was coined on the Usenet newsgroup
   comp.security.unix at a time when sendmail security holes, which
   allowed outside @{"cracker" LINK "jarg_C" 1253}s access to the system, were being
   uncovered at an alarming rate, forcing sysadmins to update very
   often.  Also, more completely, `fatal security bug-of-the-month
   club'.

@{b}buglix@{ub} /buhg'liks/ n.  Pejorative term referring to
   @{"DEC" LINK "jarg_D" 246}'s ULTRIX operating system in its earlier *severely*
   buggy versions.  Still used to describe ULTRIX, but without nearly
   so much venom.  Compare @{"AIDX" LINK "jarg_A" 172}, @{"HP-SUX" LINK "jarg_H" 866}, @{"Nominal Semidestructor" LINK "jarg_N" 523},
   @{"Telerat" LINK "jarg_T" 384}, @{"sun-stools" LINK "jarg_S" 1787}.

@{b}bulletproof@{ub} adj.  Used of an algorithm or implementation
   considered extremely @{"robust" LINK "jarg_R" 551}; lossage-resistant; capable of
   correctly recovering from any imaginable exception condition -- a
   rare and valued quality.  Syn. @{"armor-plated" LINK "jarg_A" 391}.

@{b}bum@{ub}  1. vt. To make highly efficient, either in time or
   space, often at the expense of clarity.  "I managed to bum three
   more instructions out of that code."  "I spent half the night
   bumming the interrupt code."  In @{"elder days" LINK "jarg_E" 102}, John McCarthy
   (inventor of @{"LISP" LINK "jarg_L" 371}) used to compare some efficiency-obsessed
   hackers among his students to "ski bums"; thus, optimization
   became "program bumming", and eventually just "bumming".  2. To
   squeeze out excess; to remove something in order to improve
   whatever it was removed from (without changing function; this
   distinguishes the process from a @{"featurectomy" LINK "jarg_F" 245}).  3. n. A small
   change to an algorithm, program, or hardware device to make it more
   efficient.  "This hardware bum makes the jump instruction
   faster."  Usage: now uncommon, largely superseded by v. @{"tune" LINK "jarg_T" 1145}
   (and n. @{"tweak" LINK "jarg_T" 1177}, @{"hack" LINK "jarg_H" 28}), though none of these exactly
   capture sense 2.  All these uses are rare in Commonwealth hackish,
   because in the parent dialects of English `bum' is a rude synonym
   for `buttocks'.

@{b}bump@{ub} vt.  Synonym for increment.  Has the same meaning as
   C's ++ operator.  Used esp. of counter variables, pointers, and
   index dummies in `for', `while', and `do-while'
   loops.

@{b}burble@{ub} v.  [from Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky"] Like
   @{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600}, but connotes that the source is truly clueless and
   ineffectual (mere flamers can be competent).  A term of deep
   contempt.  "There's some guy on the phone burbling about how he
   got a DISK FULL error and it's all our comm software's fault."
   This is mainstream slang in some parts of England.

@{b}buried treasure@{ub} n.  A surprising piece of code found in some
   program.  While usually not wrong, it tends to vary from
   @{"crufty" LINK "jarg_C" 1537} to @{"bletcherous" LINK "jarg_B" 993}, and has lain undiscovered only
   because it was functionally correct, however horrible it is.  Used
   sarcastically, because what is found is anything *but*
   treasure.  Buried treasure almost always needs to be dug up and
   removed.  "I just found that the scheduler sorts its queue using
   @{"bubble sort" LINK "jarg_B" 1882}!  Buried treasure!"

@{b}burn-in period@{ub} n.  1. A factory test designed to catch
   systems with @{"marginal" LINK "jarg_M" 283} components before they get out the door;
   the theory is that burn-in will protect customers by outwaiting the
   steepest part of the @{"bathtub curve" LINK "jarg_B" 375} (see @{"infant mortality" LINK "jarg_I" 227}).
   2. A period of indeterminate length in which a person
   using a computer is so intensely involved in his project that he
   forgets basic needs such as food, drink, sleep, etc.  Warning:
   Excessive burn-in can lead to burn-out.  See @{"hack mode" LINK "jarg_H" 61},
   @{"larval stage" LINK "jarg_L" 61}.

@{b}burst page@{ub} n.  Syn. @{"banner" LINK "jarg_B" 244}, sense 1.

@{b}busy-wait@{ub} vi.  Used of human behavior, conveys that the
   subject is busy waiting for someone or something, intends to move
   instantly as soon as it shows up, and thus cannot do anything else
   at the moment.  "Can't talk now, I'm busy-waiting till Bill gets
   off the phone."

   Technically, `busy-wait' means to wait on an event by
   @{"spin" LINK "jarg_S" 1473}ning through a tight or timed-delay loop that polls for
   the event on each pass, as opposed to setting up an interrupt
   handler and continuing execution on another part of the task.  This
   is a wasteful technique, best avoided on time-sharing systems where
   a busy-waiting program may @{"hog" LINK "jarg_H" 727} the processor.

@{b}buzz@{ub} vi.  1. Of a program, to run with no indication of
   progress and perhaps without guarantee of ever finishing; esp.
   said of programs thought to be executing tight loops of code.  A
   program that is buzzing appears to be @{"catatonic" LINK "jarg_C" 249}, but never
   gets out of catatonia, while a buzzing loop may eventually end of
   its own accord.  "The program buzzes for about 10 seconds trying
   to sort all the names into order."  See @{"spin" LINK "jarg_S" 1473}; see also
   @{"grovel" LINK "jarg_G" 803}.  2. [ETA Systems] To test a wire or printed circuit
   trace for continuity by applying an AC rather than DC signal.  Some
   wire faults will pass DC tests but fail a buzz test.  3. To process
   an array or list in sequence, doing the same thing to each element.
   "This loop buzzes through the tz array looking for a terminator
   type."

@{b}BWQ@{ub} /B-W-Q/ n.  [IBM: abbreviation, `Buzz Word Quotient']
   The percentage of buzzwords in a speech or documents.  Usually
   roughly proportional to @{"bogosity" LINK "jarg_B" 1365}.  See @{"TLA" LINK "jarg_T" 747}.

@{b}by hand@{ub} adv.  1. Said of an operation (especially a
   repetitive, trivial, and/or tedious one) that ought to be performed
   automatically by the computer, but which a hacker instead has to
   step tediously through.  "My mailer doesn't have a command to
   include the text of the message I'm replying to, so I have to do it
   by hand."  This does not necessarily mean the speaker has to
   retype a copy of the message; it might refer to, say, dropping into
   a subshell from the mailer, making a copy of one's mailbox file,
   reading that into an editor, locating the top and bottom of the
   message in question, deleting the rest of the file, inserting `>'
   characters on each line, writing the file, leaving the editor,
   returning to the mailer, reading the file in, and later remembering
   to delete the file.  Compare @{"eyeball search" LINK "jarg_E" 507}.  2. By extension,
   writing code which does something in an explicit or low-level way
   for which a presupplied library routine ought to have been
   available.  "This cretinous B-tree library doesn't supply a decent
   iterator, so I'm having to walk the trees by hand."

@{b}@{u}byte@{uu}@{ub} /bi:t/ n.  [techspeak] A unit of memory or data equal to
   the amount used to represent one character; on modern architectures
   this is usually 8 bits, but may be 9 on 36-bit machines.  Some
   older architectures used `byte' for quantities of 6 or 7 bits, and
   the PDP-10 supported `bytes' that were actually bitfields of
   1 to 36 bits!  These usages are now obsolete, and even 9-bit bytes
   have become rare in the general trend toward power-of-2 word sizes.

   Historical note: The term was coined by Werner Buchholz in 1956
   during the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer;
   originally it was described as 1 to 6 bits (typical I/O equipment
   of the period used 6-bit chunks of information).  The move to an
   8-bit byte happened in late 1956, and this size was later adopted
   and promulgated as a standard by the System/360.  The word was
   coined by mutating the word `bite' so it would not be
   accidentally misspelled as @{"bit" LINK "jarg_B" 729}.  See also @{"nybble" LINK "jarg_N" 681}.

@{b}bytesexual@{ub} /bi:t`sek'shu-*l/ adj.  Said of hardware,
   denotes willingness to compute or pass data in either
   @{"big-endian" LINK "jarg_B" 622} or @{"little-endian" LINK "jarg_L" 407} format (depending,
   presumably, on a @{"mode bit" LINK "jarg_M" 873} somewhere).  See also 
   @{"NUXI problem" LINK "jarg_N" 674}.

@{b}bzzzt, wrong@{ub} /bzt rong/  [Usenet/Internet] From a Robin
   Williams routine in the movie "Dead Poets Society" spoofing
   radio or TV quiz programs, such as *Truth or Consequences*,
   where an incorrect answer earns one a blast from the buzzer and
   condolences from the interlocutor.  A way of expressing mock-rude
   disagreement, usually immediately following an included quote from
   another poster.  The less abbreviated "*Bzzzzt*, wrong, but thank
   you for playing" is also common; capitalization and emphasis of
   the buzzer sound varies.

@endnode
@node jarg_C "C"
@{b}C@{ub} n.  1. The third letter of the English alphabet.  2. ASCII
   1000011.  3. The name of a programming language designed by Dennis
   Ritchie during the early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement
   @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54}; so called because many features derived from an earlier
   compiler named `B' in commemoration of *its* parent, BCPL.
   (BCPL was in turn descended from an earlier Algol-derived language,
   CPL.)  Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled the question by designing
   C++, there was a humorous debate over whether C's successor should
   be named `D' or `P'.  C became immensely popular outside Bell Labs
   after about 1980 and is now the dominant language in systems and
   microcomputer applications programming.  See also 
   @{"languages of choice" LINK "jarg_L" 37}, @{"indent style" LINK "jarg_I" 164}.

   C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain
   varying according to the speaker, as "a language that combines
   all the elegance and power of assembly language with all the
   readability and maintainability of assembly language".

@{b}C Programmer's Disease@{ub} n.  The tendency of the undisciplined
   C programmer to set arbitrary but supposedly generous static limits
   on table sizes (defined, if you're lucky, by constants in header
   files) rather than taking the trouble to do proper dynamic storage
   allocation.  If an application user later needs to put 68 elements
   into a table of size 50, the afflicted programmer reasons that he
   or she can easily reset the table size to 68 (or even as much as
   70, to allow for future expansion) and recompile.  This gives the
   programmer the comfortable feeling of having made the effort to
   satisfy the user's (unreasonable) demands, and often affords the
   user multiple opportunities to explore the marvelous consequences
   of @{"fandango on core" LINK "jarg_F" 60}.  In severe cases of the disease, the
   programmer cannot comprehend why each fix of this kind seems only
   to further disgruntle the user.

@{b}calculator@{ub} [Cambridge] n.  Syn. for @{"bitty box" LINK "jarg_B" 924}.

@{b}Camel Book@{ub} n.  Universally recognized nickname for the book
   "Programming Perl", by Larry Wall and Randall L. Schwartz,
   O'Reilly Associates 1991, ISBN 0-93715-64-1.  The definitive
   reference on @{"Perl" LINK "jarg_P" 356}.

@{b}can@{ub} vt.  To abort a job on a time-sharing system.  Used
   esp. when the person doing the deed is an operator, as in
   "canned from the @{"console" LINK "jarg_C" 975}".  Frequently used in an imperative
   sense, as in "Can that print job, the LPT just popped a
   sprocket!"  Synonymous with @{"gun" LINK "jarg_G" 839}.  It is said that the ASCII
   character with mnemonic CAN (0011000) was used as a kill-job
   character on some early OSes.  Alternatively, this term may derive
   from mainstream slang `canned' for being laid off or fired.

@{b}can't happen@{ub}  The traditional program comment for code
   executed under a condition that should never be true, for example a
   file size computed as negative.  Often, such a condition being true
   indicates data corruption or a faulty algorithm; it is almost
   always handled by emitting a fatal error message and terminating or
   crashing, since there is little else that can be done.  Some case
   variant of "can't happen" is also often the text emitted if the
   `impossible' error actually happens!  Although "can't happen"
   events are genuinely infrequent in production code, programmers
   wise enough to check for them habitually are often surprised at how
   frequently they are triggered during development and how many
   headaches checking for them turns out to head off. See also
   @{"firewall code" LINK "jarg_F" 509} (sense 2).

@{b}candygrammar@{ub} n.  A programming-language grammar that is
   mostly @{"syntactic sugar" LINK "jarg_S" 1918}; the term is also a play on
   `candygram'.  @{"COBOL" LINK "jarg_C" 592}, Apple's Hypertalk language, and a lot
   of the so-called `4GL' database languages share this property.
   The usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as
   possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled
   people to program.  This intention comes to grief on the reality
   that syntax isn't what makes programming hard; it's the mental
   effort and organization required to specify an algorithm precisely
   that costs.  Thus the invariable result is that `candygrammar'
   languages are just as difficult to program in as terser ones, and
   far more painful for the experienced hacker.

   [The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live
   should not be overlooked.  This was a "Jaws" parody.
   Someone lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus
   ways to get the occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in
   the background.  The last attempt is a half-hearted "Candygram!"
   When the door is opened, a shark bursts in and chomps the poor
   occupant.  There is a moral here for those attracted to
   candygrammars.  Note that, in many circles, pretty much the same
   ones who remember Monty Python sketches, all it takes is the word
   "Candygram!", suitably timed, to get people rolling on the
   floor. -- GLS]

@{b}canonical@{ub} adj.  [historically, `according to religious law']
   The usual or standard state or manner of something.  This word has
   a somewhat more technical meaning in mathematics.  Two formulas
   such as 9 + x and x + 9 are said to be equivalent
   because they mean the same thing, but the second one is in
   `canonical form' because it is written in the usual way, with the
   highest power of x first.  Usually there are fixed rules you
   can use to decide whether something is in canonical form.  The
   jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning, acquired its
   present loading in computer-science culture largely through its
   prominence in Alonzo Church's work in computation theory and
   mathematical logic (see @{"Knights of the Lambda Calculus" LINK "jarg_K" 244}).
   Compare @{"vanilla" LINK "jarg_V" 23}.

   This word has an interesting history.  Non-technical academics do
   not use the adjective `canonical' in any of the senses defined
   above with any regularity; they do however use the nouns `canon'
   and `canonicity' (not **canonicalness or **canonicality). The
   `canon' of a given author is the complete body of authentic works
   by that author (this usage is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as
   well as to literary scholars).  `*The* canon' is the body of
   works in a given field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of
   music) deemed worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to
   investigate.

   The word `canon' derives ultimately from the Greek
   `kanon'
   (akin to the English `cane') referring to a reed.  Reeds were used
   for measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word `canon'
   meant a rule or a standard.  The establishment of a canon of
   scriptures within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a
   rule for the religion.  The above non-techspeak academic usages
   stem from this instance of a defined and accepted body of work.
   Alongside this usage was the promulgation of `canons' (`rules')
   for the government of the Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages
   ("according to religious law") derive from this use of the Latin
   `canon'.

   Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
   contrast with its historical meaning.  A true story: One Bob
   Sjoberg, new at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the
   incessant use of jargon.  Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS
   made a point of using as much of it as possible in his presence,
   and eventually it began to sink in.  Finally, in one conversation,
   he used the word `canonical' in jargon-like fashion without
   thinking.  Steele: "Aha!  We've finally got you talking jargon
   too!"  Stallman: "What did he say?"  Steele: "Bob just used
   `canonical' in the canonical way."

   Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly
   defined as the way *hackers* normally expect things to be.
   Thus, a hacker may claim with a straight face that `according to
   religious law' is *not* the canonical meaning of
   `canonical'.

@{b}card walloper@{ub} n.  An EDP programmer who grinds out batch
   programs that do stupid things like print people's paychecks.
   Compare @{"code grinder" LINK "jarg_C" 613}.  See also @{"punched card" LINK "jarg_P" 1073},
   @{"eighty-column mind" LINK "jarg_E" 56}.

@{b}careware@{ub} /keir'weir/ n.  A variety of @{"shareware" LINK "jarg_S" 653} for
   which either the author suggests that some payment be made to a
   nominated charity or a levy directed to charity is included on top
   of the distribution charge.  Syn. @{"charityware" LINK "jarg_C" 355}; compare
   @{"crippleware" LINK "jarg_C" 1442}, sense 2.

@{b}cargo cult programming@{ub} n.  A style of (incompetent)
   programming dominated by ritual inclusion of code or program
   structures that serve no real purpose.  A cargo cult programmer
   will usually explain the extra code as a way of working around some
   bug encountered in the past, but usually neither the bug nor the
   reason the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully
   understood (compare @{"shotgun debugging" LINK "jarg_S" 703}, @{"voodoo programming" LINK "jarg_V" 390}).

   The term `cargo cult' is a reference to aboriginal religions that
   grew up in the South Pacific after World War II.  The practices of
   these cults center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes and
   military style landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of
   the god-like airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the
   war.  Hackish usage probably derives from Richard Feynman's
   characterization of certain practices as "cargo cult science" in
   his book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" (W. W. Norton
   & Co, New York 1985, ISBN 0-393-01921-7).

@{b}cascade@{ub} n.  1. A huge volume of spurious error-message
   output produced by a compiler with poor error recovery.  Too
   frequently, one trivial syntax error (such as a missing `)' or
   `}') throws the parser out of synch so that much of the remaining
   program text is interpreted as garbaged or ill-formed.  2. A chain
   of Usenet followups, each adding some trivial variation or riposte
   to the text of the previous one, all of which is reproduced in the
   new message; an @{"include war" LINK "jarg_I" 159} in which the object is to create a
   sort of communal graffito.

@{b}case and paste@{ub} n.  [from `cut and paste'] 1. The addition of a new
   @{"feature" LINK "jarg_F" 151} to an existing system by selecting the code from an
   existing feature and pasting it in with minor changes.  Common in
   telephony circles because most operations in a telephone switch are
   selected using `case' statements.  Leads to @{"software bloat" LINK "jarg_S" 1223}.

   In some circles of EMACS users this is called `programming by
   Meta-W', because Meta-W is the EMACS command for copying a block of
   text to a kill buffer in preparation to pasting it in elsewhere.
   The term is condescending, implying that the programmer is acting
   mindlessly rather than thinking carefully about what is required to
   integrate the code for two similar cases.

   At DEC, this is sometimes called `clone-and-hack' coding.

@{b}casters-up mode@{ub} n.  [IBM, prob. fr. slang belly up] Yet
   another synonym for `broken' or `down'.  Usually connotes a
   major failure.  A system (hardware or software) which is `down'
   may be already being restarted before the failure is noticed,
   whereas one which is `casters up' is usually a good excuse to
   take the rest of the day off (as long as you're not responsible for
   fixing it).

@{b}casting the runes@{ub} n.  What a @{"guru" LINK "jarg_G" 852} does when you ask him
   or her to run a particular program and type at it because it never
   works for anyone else; esp. used when nobody can ever see what
   the guru is doing different from what J. Random Luser does.
   Compare @{"incantation" LINK "jarg_I" 142}, @{"runes" LINK "jarg_R" 710}, @{"examining the entrails" LINK "jarg_E" 453};
   also see the AI koan about Tom Knight in "@{"AI Koans" LINK "jarg_app" 353}"
   (Appendix A).

   A correspondent from England tells us that one of ICL's most
   talented systems designers used to be called out occasionally to
   service machines which the @{"field circus" LINK "jarg_F" 356} had given up on.
   Since he knew the design inside out, he could often find faults
   simply by listening to a quick outline of the symptoms.  He used to
   play on this by going to some site where the field circus had just
   spent the last two weeks solid trying to find a fault, and
   spreading a diagram of the system out on a table top.  He'd then
   shake some chicken bones and cast them over the diagram, peer at
   the bones intently for a minute, and then tell them that a certain
   module needed replacing.  The system would start working again
   immediately upon the replacement.

@{b}cat@{ub} [from `catenate' via @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54} `cat(1)'] vt. 
   1. [techspeak] To spew an entire file to the screen or some other
   output sink without pause.  2. By extension, to dump large amounts
   of data at an unprepared target or with no intention of browsing it
   carefully.  Usage: considered silly.  Rare outside Unix sites.  See
   also @{"dd" LINK "jarg_D" 83}, @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155}.

   Among Unix fans, `cat(1)' is considered an excellent example
   of user-interface design, because it delivers the file contents
   without such verbosity as spacing or headers between the files, and
   because it does not require the files to consist of lines of text,
   but works with any sort of data.

   Among Unix haters, `cat(1)' is considered the @{"canonical" LINK "jarg_C" 89}
   example of *bad* user-interface design, because of its
   woefully unobvious name.  It is far more often used to @{"blast" LINK "jarg_B" 980} a
   file to standard output than to concatenate two files.  The name
   `cat' for the former operation is just as unintuitive as, say,
   LISP's @{"cdr" LINK "jarg_C" 265}.

   Of such oppositions are @{"holy wars" LINK "jarg_H" 753} made....

@{b}catatonic@{ub} adj.  Describes a condition of suspended animation
   in which something is so @{"wedged" LINK "jarg_W" 300} or @{"hung" LINK "jarg_H" 933} that it makes no
   response.  If you are typing on a terminal and suddenly the
   computer doesn't even echo the letters back to the screen as you
   type, let alone do what you're asking it to do, then the computer
   is suffering from catatonia (possibly because it has crashed).
   "There I was in the middle of a winning game of @{"nethack" LINK "jarg_N" 257} and
   it went catatonic on me!  Aaargh!" Compare @{"buzz" LINK "jarg_B" 2126}.

@{b}cd tilde@{ub} /C-D til-d*/ vi.  To go home.  From the Unix
   C-shell and Korn-shell command `cd ~', which takes one to
   one's `$HOME' (`cd' with no arguments happens to do the
   same thing).  By extension, may be used with other arguments; thus,
   over an electronic chat link, `cd ~coffee' would mean "I'm
   going to the coffee machine."

@{b}cdr@{ub} /ku'dr/ or /kuh'dr/ vt.  [from LISP] To skip past
   the first item from a list of things (generalized from the LISP
   operation on binary tree structures, which returns a list
   consisting of all but the first element of its argument).  In the
   form `cdr down', to trace down a list of elements: "Shall we cdr
   down the agenda?"  Usage: silly.  See also @{"loop through" LINK "jarg_L" 532}.

   Historical note: The instruction format of the IBM 7090 that hosted
   the original LISP implementation featured two 15-bit fields called
   the `address' and `decrement' parts.  The term `cdr' was originally
   `Contents of Decrement part of Register'.  Similarly, `car' stood
   for `Contents of Address part of Register'.

   The cdr and car operations have since become bases for
   formation of compound metaphors in non-LISP contexts.  GLS recalls,
   for example, a programming project in which strings were
   represented as linked lists; the get-character and skip-character
   operations were of course called CHAR and CHDR.

@{b}chad@{ub} /chad/ n.  1. The perforated edge strips on printer
   paper, after they have been separated from the printed portion.
   Also called @{"selvage" LINK "jarg_S" 556} and @{"perf" LINK "jarg_P" 342}.  2. obs. The confetti-like
   paper bits punched out of cards or paper tape; this has also been
   called `chaff', `computer confetti', and `keypunch
   droppings'.  This use may now be mainstream; it has been reported
   seen (1993) in directions for a card-based voting machine in
   California.

   Historical note: One correspondent believes `chad' (sense 2)
   derives from the Chadless keypunch (named for its inventor), which
   cut little u-shaped tabs in the card to make a hole when the tab
   folded back, rather than punching out a circle/rectangle; it was
   clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make them, then the
   stuff that other keypunches made had to be `chad'.  There is a
   legend that the word was originally acronymic, standing for
   "Card Hole Aggregate Debris", but this has all the earmarks of
   a bogus folk etymology.

@{b}chad box@{ub} n.  A metal box about the size of a lunchbox (or in
   some models a large wastebasket), for collecting the @{"chad" LINK "jarg_C" 284}
   (sense 2) that accumulated in @{"Iron Age" LINK "jarg_I" 433} card punches.  You had
   to open the covers of the card punch periodically and empty the
   chad box.  The @{"bit bucket" LINK "jarg_B" 787} was notionally the equivalent device
   in the CPU enclosure, which was typically across the room in
   another great gray-and-blue box.

@{b}chain@{ub}  1. vi. [orig. from BASIC's `CHAIN' statement]
   To hand off execution to a child or successor without going
   through the @{"OS" LINK "jarg_O" 304} command interpreter that invoked it.  The state
   of the parent program is lost and there is no returning to it.
   Though this facility used to be common on memory-limited micros and
   is still widely supported for backward compatibility, the jargon
   usage is semi-obsolescent; in particular, most Unix programmers
   will think of this as an @{"exec" LINK "jarg_E" 477}.  Oppose the more modern
   `subshell'.  2. n. A series of linked data areas within an
   operating system or application.  `Chain rattling' is the process
   of repeatedly running through the linked data areas searching for
   one which is of interest to the executing program.  The implication
   is that there is a very large number of links on the chain.

@{b}channel@{ub} n.  [IRC] The basic unit of discussion on @{"IRC" LINK "jarg_I" 415}.
   Once one joins a channel, everything one types is read by others on
   that channel.  Channels can either be named with numbers or with
   strings that begin with a `#' sign and can have topic descriptions
   (which are generally irrelevant to the actual subject of
   discussion).  Some notable channels are `#initgame',
   `#hottub', and `#report'.  At times of international
   crisis, `#report' has hundreds of members, some of whom take
   turns listening to various news services and typing in summaries of
   the news, or in some cases, giving first-hand accounts of the
   action (e.g., Scud missile attacks in Tel Aviv during the Gulf War
   in 1991).
   
@{b}channel hopping@{ub} n.  [IRC, GEnie] To rapidly switch channels
   on @{"IRC" LINK "jarg_I" 415}, or a GEnie chat board, just as a social butterfly
   might hop from one group to another at a party.  This term may
   derive from the TV watcher's idiom, `channel surfing'.

@{b}channel op@{ub} /chan'l op/ n.  [IRC] Someone who is endowed
   with privileges on a particular @{"IRC" LINK "jarg_I" 415} channel; commonly
   abbreviated `chanop' or `CHOP'.  These privileges include the
   right to @{"kick" LINK "jarg_K" 65} users, to change various status bits, and to
   make others into CHOPs.
   
@{b}chanop@{ub} /chan'-op/ n.  [IRC] See @{"channel op" LINK "jarg_C" 343}.

@{b}char@{ub} /keir/ or /char/; rarely, /kar/ n.  Shorthand for
   `character'.  Esp. used by C programmers, as `char' is C's
   typename for character data.

@{b}charityware@{ub} /cha'rit-ee-weir`/ n.  Syn. @{"careware" LINK "jarg_C" 149}.

@{b}chase pointers@{ub}  1. vi. To go through multiple levels of
   indirection, as in traversing a linked list or graph structure.
   Used esp. by programmers in C, where explicit pointers are a very
   common data type.  This is techspeak, but it remains jargon when
   used of human networks.  "I'm chasing pointers.  Bob said you
   could tell me who to talk to about...." See @{"dangling pointer" LINK "jarg_D" 46}
   and @{"snap" LINK "jarg_S" 1113}.  2. [Cambridge] `pointer chase' or
   `pointer hunt': The process of going through a @{"core dump" LINK "jarg_C" 1156}
   (sense 1), interactively or on a large piece of paper printed with
   hex @{"runes" LINK "jarg_R" 710}, following dynamic data-structures.  Used only in a
   debugging context.

@{b}chawmp@{ub} n.  [University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a
   machine word).  This term was used by FORTH hackers during the late
   1970s/early 1980s; it is said to have been archaic then, and may
   now be obsolete.  It was coined in revolt against the promiscuous
   use of `word' for anything between 16 and 32 bits; `word' has
   an additional special meaning for FORTH hacks that made the
   overloading intolerable.  For similar reasons, /gaw'bl/ (spelled
   `gawble' or possibly `gawbul') was in use as a term for 32 or
   48 bits (presumably a full machine word, but our sources are
   unclear on this).  These terms are more easily understood if one
   thinks of them as faithful phonetic spellings of `chomp' and
   `gobble' pronounced in a Florida or other Southern U.S. dialect.
   For general discussion of similar terms, see @{"nybble" LINK "jarg_N" 681}.

@{b}check@{ub} n.  A hardware-detected error condition, most commonly
   used to refer to actual hardware failures rather than
   software-induced traps.  E.g., a `parity check' is the result of
   a hardware-detected parity error.  Recorded here because the word
   often humorously extended to non-technical problems. For example,
   the term `child check' has been used to refer to the problems
   caused by a small child who is curious to know what happens when
   s/he presses all the cute buttons on a computer's console (of
   course, this particular problem could have been prevented with
   @{"molly-guard" LINK "jarg_M" 889}s).

@{b}chemist@{ub} n.  [Cambridge] Someone who wastes computer time
   on @{"number-crunching" LINK "jarg_N" 655} when you'd far rather the machine were
   doing something more productive, such as working out anagrams of
   your name or printing Snoopy calendars or running @{"life" LINK "jarg_L" 193}
   patterns.  May or may not refer to someone who actually studies
   chemistry.

@{b}Chernobyl chicken@{ub} n.  See @{"laser chicken" LINK "jarg_L" 79}.

@{b}Chernobyl packet@{ub} /cher-noh'b*l pak'*t/ n.  A network
   packet that induces a @{"broadcast storm" LINK "jarg_B" 1732} and/or @{"network meltdown" LINK "jarg_N" 315},
   in memory of the April 1986 nuclear accident at
   Chernobyl in Ukraine.  The typical scenario involves an IP Ethernet
   datagram that passes through a gateway with both source and
   destination Ether and IP address set as the respective broadcast
   addresses for the subnetworks being gated between.  Compare
   @{"Christmas tree packet" LINK "jarg_C" 483}.

@{b}chicken head@{ub} n.  [Commodore] The Commodore Business
   Machines logo, which strongly resembles a poultry part.  Rendered
   in ASCII as `C='.  With the arguable exception of the Amiga (see
   @{"amoeba" LINK "jarg_A" 255}), Commodore's machines are notoriously crocky little
   @{"bitty box" LINK "jarg_B" 924}es (see also @{"PETSCII" LINK "jarg_P" 391}).  Thus, this usage may owe
   something to Philip K. Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream of
   Electric Sheep?"  (the basis for the movie "Blade Runner"; the
   novel is now sold under that title), in which a `chickenhead' is
   a mutant with below-average intelligence.

@{b}chiclet keyboard@{ub} n.  A keyboard with a small, flat
   rectangular or lozenge-shaped rubber or plastic keys that look like
   pieces of chewing gum.  (Chiclets is the brand name of a variety of
   chewing gum that does in fact resemble the keys of chiclet
   keyboards.)  Used esp. to describe the original IBM PCjr
   keyboard.  Vendors unanimously liked these because they were cheap,
   and a lot of early portable and laptop products got launched using
   them.  Customers rejected the idea with almost equal unanimity, and
   chiclets are not often seen on anything larger than a digital watch
   any more.

@{b}chine nual@{ub} /sheen'yu-*l/ n.,obs.  [MIT] The LISP Machine
   Manual, so called because the title was wrapped around the cover so
   only those letters showed on the front.

@{b}Chinese Army technique@{ub} n.  Syn. @{"Mongolian Hordes technique" LINK "jarg_M" 897}.

@{b}choad@{ub} /chohd/ n.  Synonym for `penis' used in
   alt.tasteless and popularized by the denizens thereof.  They
   say: "We think maybe it's from Middle English but we're all too
   damned lazy to check the OED."  [I'm not.  It isn't. -- ESR] This
   term is alleged to have been inherited through 1960s underground
   comics, and to have been recently sighted in the Beavis and
   Butthead cartoons.

@{b}choke@{ub} v.  1. To reject input, often ungracefully.  "NULs
   make System V's `lpr(1)' choke."  "I tried building an
   @{"EMACS" LINK "jarg_E" 185} binary to use @{"X" LINK "jarg_X" 1}, but `cpp(1)' choked on all
   those `#define's."  See @{"barf" LINK "jarg_B" 294}, @{"gag" LINK "jarg_G" 24}, @{"vi" LINK "jarg_V" 248}.
   2. [MIT] More generally, to fail at any endeavor, but with some
   flair or bravado; the popular definition is "to snatch defeat from
   the jaws of victory."

@{b}chomp@{ub} vi.  To @{"lose" LINK "jarg_L" 549}; specifically, to chew on something
   of which more was bitten off than one can.  Probably related to
   gnashing of teeth.  See @{"bagbiter" LINK "jarg_B" 130}.

   A hand gesture commonly accompanies this.  To perform it, hold the
   four fingers together and place the thumb against their tips.  Now
   open and close your hand rapidly to suggest a biting action (much
   like what Pac-Man does in the classic video game, though this
   pantomime seems to predate that).  The gesture alone means `chomp
   chomp' (see "@{"Verb Doubling" LINK "jarg_%" 517}" in the "@{"Jargon Construction" LINK "jarg_%" 500}"
   section of the Prependices).  The hand may be
   pointed at the object of complaint, and for real emphasis you can
   use both hands at once.  Doing this to a person is equivalent to
   saying "You chomper!"  If you point the gesture at yourself, it
   is a humble but humorous admission of some failure.  You might do
   this if someone told you that a program you had written had failed
   in some surprising way and you felt dumb for not having anticipated
   it.

@{b}chomper@{ub} n.  Someone or something that is chomping; a loser.
   See @{"loser" LINK "jarg_L" 561}, @{"bagbiter" LINK "jarg_B" 130}, @{"chomp" LINK "jarg_C" 455}.

@{b}CHOP@{ub} /chop/ n.  [IRC] See @{"channel op" LINK "jarg_C" 343}.

@{b}Christmas tree@{ub} n.  A kind of RS-232 line tester or breakout
   box featuring rows of blinking red and green LEDs suggestive of
   Christmas lights.

@{b}Christmas tree packet@{ub} n.  A packet with every single option
   set for whatever protocol is in use.  See @{"kamikaze packet" LINK "jarg_K" 22},
   @{"Chernobyl packet" LINK "jarg_C" 403}.  (The term doubtless derives from a fanciful
   image of each little option bit being represented by a
   different-colored light bulb, all turned on.)

@{b}chrome@{ub} n.  [from automotive slang via wargaming] Showy features
   added to attract users but contributing little or nothing to
   the power of a system.  "The 3D icons in Motif are just chrome,
   but they certainly are *pretty* chrome!"  Distinguished from
   @{"bells and whistles" LINK "jarg_B" 465} by the fact that the latter are usually
   added to gratify developers' own desires for featurefulness.
   Often used as a term of contempt.

@{b}chug@{ub} vi.  To run slowly; to @{"grind" LINK "jarg_G" 718} or @{"grovel" LINK "jarg_G" 803}.
   "The disk is chugging like crazy."

@{b}Church of the SubGenius@{ub} n.  A mutant offshoot of
   @{"Discordianism" LINK "jarg_D" 617} launched in 1981 as a spoof of fundamentalist
   Christianity by the `Reverend' Ivan Stang, a brilliant satirist
   with a gift for promotion.  Popular among hackers as a rich source
   of bizarre imagery and references such as "Bob" the divine
   drilling-equipment salesman, the Benevolent Space Xists, and the
   Stark Fist of Removal.  Much SubGenius theory is concerned with the
   acquisition of the mystical substance or quality of @{"slack" LINK "jarg_S" 859}.

@{b}Cinderella Book@{ub} [CMU] n.  "Introduction to Automata
   Theory, Languages, and Computation", by John Hopcroft and Jeffrey
   Ullman, (Addison-Wesley, 1979).  So called because the cover
   depicts a girl (putatively Cinderella) sitting in front of a Rube
   Goldberg device and holding a rope coming out of it.  On the back
   cover, the device is in shambles after she has (inevitably) pulled
   on the rope.  See also @{"book titles" LINK "jarg_B" 1461}.

@{b}CI$@{ub} // n.  Hackerism for `CIS', CompuServe Information
   Service.  The dollar sign refers to CompuServe's rather steep line
   charges.  Often used in @{"sig block" LINK "jarg_S" 767}s just before a CompuServe
   address.  Syn. @{"Compu$erve" LINK "jarg_C" 831}.

@{b}Classic C@{ub} /klas'ik C/ [a play on `Coke Classic'] n.  The
   C programming language as defined in the first edition of @{"K&R" LINK "jarg_K" 5},
   with some small additions.  It is also known as `K&R C'.  The name
   came into use while C was being standardized by the ANSI X3J11
   committee.  Also `C Classic'.

   An analogous construction is sometimes applied elsewhere: thus,
   `X Classic', where X = Star Trek (referring to the original TV
   series) or X = PC (referring to IBM's ISA-bus machines as opposed
   to the PS/2 series).  This construction is especially used of
   product series in which the newer versions are considered serious
   losers relative to the older ones.

@{b}clean@{ub} 1. adj.  Used of hardware or software designs, implies
   `elegance in the small', that is, a design or implementation that
   may not hold any surprises but does things in a way that is
   reasonably intuitive and relatively easy to comprehend from the
   outside.  The antonym is `grungy' or @{"crufty" LINK "jarg_C" 1537}.  2. v. To
   remove unneeded or undesired files in a effort to reduce clutter:
   "I'm cleaning up my account."  "I cleaned up the garbage and now
   have 100 Meg free on that partition."

@{b}CLM@{ub} /C-L-M/  [Sun: `Career Limiting Move'] 1. n. An action
   endangering one's future prospects of getting plum projects and
   raises, and possibly one's job: "His Halloween costume was a
   parody of his manager.  He won the prize for `best CLM'."  2. adj.
   Denotes extreme severity of a bug, discovered by a customer and
   obviously missed earlier because of poor testing: "That's a CLM
   bug!"

@{b}clobber@{ub} vt.  To overwrite, usually unintentionally: "I
   walked off the end of the array and clobbered the stack."  Compare
   @{"mung" LINK "jarg_M" 1242}, @{"scribble" LINK "jarg_S" 412}, @{"trash" LINK "jarg_T" 975}, and @{"smash the stack" LINK "jarg_S" 960}.

@{b}clocks@{ub} n.  Processor logic cycles, so called because each
   generally corresponds to one clock pulse in the processor's timing.
   The relative execution times of instructions on a machine are
   usually discussed in clocks rather than absolute fractions of a
   second; one good reason for this is that clock speeds for various
   models of the machine may increase as technology improves, and it
   is usually the relative times one is interested in when discussing
   the instruction set.  Compare @{"cycle" LINK "jarg_C" 1707}.

@{b}clone@{ub} n.  1. An exact duplicate: "Our product is a clone of
   their product."  Implies a legal reimplementation from
   documentation or by reverse-engineering.  Also connotes lower
   price.  2. A shoddy, spurious copy: "Their product is a clone of
   our product."  3. A blatant ripoff, most likely violating
   copyright, patent, or trade secret protections: "Your product is a
   clone of my product."  This use implies legal action is pending.
   4. `PC clone:' a PC-BUS/ISA or EISA-compatible 80x86-based
   microcomputer (this use is sometimes spelled `klone' or
   `PClone').  These invariably have much more bang for the buck
   than the IBM archetypes they resemble.  5. In the construction
   `Unix clone': An OS designed to deliver a Unix-lookalike
   environment without Unix license fees, or with additional
   `mission-critical' features such as support for real-time
   programming.  6. v. To make an exact copy of something.  "Let me
   clone that" might mean "I want to borrow that paper so I can make
   a photocopy" or "Let me get a copy of that file before you
   @{"mung" LINK "jarg_M" 1242} it".

@{b}clone-and-hack coding@{ub} n.  [DEC] Syn. @{"case and paste" LINK "jarg_C" 183}.

@{b}clover key@{ub} n.  [Mac users] See @{"feature key" LINK "jarg_F" 214}.

@{b}clustergeeking@{ub} /kluh'st*r-gee`king/ n.  [CMU] Spending
   more time at a computer cluster doing CS homework than most people
   spend breathing.

@{b}COBOL@{ub} /koh'bol/ n.  [COmmon Business-Oriented Language]
   (Synonymous with @{"evil" LINK "jarg_E" 426}.)  A weak, verbose, and flabby language
   used by @{"card walloper" LINK "jarg_C" 144}s to do boring mindless things on
   @{"dinosaur" LINK "jarg_D" 568} mainframes.  Hackers believe that all COBOL
   programmers are @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}s or @{"code grinder" LINK "jarg_C" 613}s, and no
   self-respecting hacker will ever admit to having learned the
   language.  Its very name is seldom uttered without ritual
   expressions of disgust or horror.  One popular one is Edsger
   Dijkstra's famous observation that "The use of COBOL cripples the
   mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal
   offense." (from "Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal
   Perspective") See also @{"fear and loathing" LINK "jarg_F" 143}, @{"software rot" LINK "jarg_S" 1246}.

@{b}COBOL fingers@{ub} /koh'bol fing'grz/ n.  Reported from Sweden,
   a (hypothetical) disease one might get from coding in COBOL.  The
   language requires code verbose beyond all reason (see
   @{"candygrammar" LINK "jarg_C" 64}); thus it is alleged that programming too much in
   COBOL causes one's fingers to wear down to stubs by the endless
   typing.  "I refuse to type in all that source code again; it would
   give me COBOL fingers!"

@{b}code grinder@{ub} n.  1. A @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}-wearing minion of the sort
   hired in legion strength by banks and insurance companies to
   implement payroll packages in RPG and other such unspeakable
   horrors.  In its native habitat, the code grinder often removes the
   suit jacket to reveal an underplumage consisting of button-down
   shirt (starch optional) and a tie.  In times of dire stress, the
   sleeves (if long) may be rolled up and the tie loosened about half
   an inch.  It seldom helps.  The @{"code grinder" LINK "jarg_C" 613}'s milieu is about
   as far from hackerdom as one can get and still touch a computer;
   the term connotes pity.  See @{"Real World" LINK "jarg_R" 267}, @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}.  2. Used
   of or to a hacker, a really serious slur on the person's creative
   ability; connotes a design style characterized by primitive
   technique, rule-boundedness, @{"brute force" LINK "jarg_B" 1795}, and utter lack of
   imagination.  Compare @{"card walloper" LINK "jarg_C" 144}; contrast @{"hacker" LINK "jarg_H" 135},
   @{"Real Programmer" LINK "jarg_R" 212}.

@{b}Code of the Geeks@{ub} n.  see @{"geek code" LINK "jarg_G" 148}.

@{b}code police@{ub} n.  [by analogy with George Orwell's `thought
   police'] A mythical team of Gestapo-like storm troopers that might
   burst into one's office and arrest one for violating programming
   style rules.  May be used either seriously, to underline a claim
   that a particular style violation is dangerous, or ironically, to
   suggest that the practice under discussion is condemned mainly by
   anal-retentive @{"weenie" LINK "jarg_W" 339}s.  "Dike out that goto or the code
   police will get you!"  The ironic usage is perhaps more common.

@{b}codes@{ub} n.  [scientific computing] Programs.  This usage is common
   in people who hack supercomputers and heavy-duty
   @{"number-crunching" LINK "jarg_N" 655}, rare to unknown elsewhere (if you say
   "codes" to hackers outside scientific computing, their
   first association is likely to be "and cyphers").

@{b}codewalker@{ub} n.  A program component that traverses other
   programs for a living.  Compilers have codewalkers in their front
   ends; so do cross-reference generators and some database front
   ends.  Other utility programs that try to do too much with source
   code may turn into codewalkers.  As in "This new `vgrind'
   feature would require a codewalker to implement."

@{b}coefficient of X@{ub} n.  Hackish speech makes heavy use of
   pseudo-mathematical metaphors.  Four particularly important
   ones involve the terms `coefficient', `factor', `index', and
   `quotient'.  They are often loosely applied to things you cannot
   really be quantitative about, but there are subtle distinctions
   among them that convey information about the way the speaker
   mentally models whatever he or she is describing.

   `Foo factor' and `foo quotient' tend to describe something for
   which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical
   example is @{"fudge factor" LINK "jarg_F" 1342}.  It's not important how much you're
   fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed.
   You might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor.
   Quotient tends to imply that the property is a ratio of two
   opposing factors: "I would have won except for my luck quotient."
   This could also be "I would have won except for the luck factor",
   but using *quotient* emphasizes that it was bad luck
   overpowering good luck (or someone else's good luck overpowering
   your own).

   `Foo index' and `coefficient of foo' both tend to imply
   that foo is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that
   can be larger or smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or
   person as having a `high bogosity index', whereas you would be less
   likely to speak of a `high bogosity factor'.  `Foo index' suggests
   that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane
   cost-of-living index; `coefficient of foo' suggests that foo is a
   fundamental quantity, as in a coefficient of friction.  The choice
   between these terms is often one of personal preference; e.g., some
   people might feel that bogosity is a fundamental attribute and thus
   say `coefficient of bogosity', whereas others might feel it is a
   combination of factors and thus say `bogosity index'.

@{b}cokebottle@{ub} /kohk'bot-l/ n.  Any very unusual character,
   particularly one you can't type because it it isn't on your
   keyboard.  MIT people used to complain about the
   `control-meta-cokebottle' commands at SAIL, and SAIL people
   complained right back about the `@{"altmode" LINK "jarg_A" 247}-altmode-cokebottle'
   commands at MIT.  After the demise of the @{"space-cadet keyboard" LINK "jarg_S" 1325},
   `cokebottle' faded away as serious usage, but was
   often invoked humorously to describe an (unspecified) weird or
   non-intuitive keystroke command.  It may be due for a second
   inning, however.  The OSF/Motif window manager, `mwm(1)', has
   a reserved keystroke for switching to the default set of
   keybindings and behavior.  This keystroke is (believe it or not)
   `control-meta-bang' (see @{"bang" LINK "jarg_B" 202}).  Since the exclamation point
   looks a lot like an upside down Coke bottle, Motif hackers have
   begun referring to this keystroke as `cokebottle'.  See also
   @{"quadruple bucky" LINK "jarg_Q" 8}.

@{b}cold boot@{ub} n.  See @{"boot" LINK "jarg_B" 1475}.

@{b}COME FROM@{ub} n.  A semi-mythical language construct dual to the
   `go to'; `COME FROM' <label> would cause the referenced label
   to act as a sort of trapdoor, so that if the program ever reached
   it control would quietly and @{"automagically" LINK "jarg_A" 729} be transferred to
   the statement following the `COME FROM'.  `COME FROM'
   was first proposed in R. Lawrence Clark's "A Linguistic
   Contribution to GOTO-less programming", which appeared in a 1973
   @{"Datamation" LINK "jarg_D" 60} issue (and was reprinted in the April 1984 issue of
   "Communications of the ACM").  This parodied the then-raging
   `structured programming' @{"holy wars" LINK "jarg_H" 753} (see @{"considered harmful" LINK "jarg_C" 961}).
   Mythically, some variants are the `assigned COME
   FROM' and the `computed COME FROM' (parodying some nasty control
   constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of course,
   multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having
   more than one `COME FROM' statement coming from the same
   label.

   In some ways the FORTRAN `DO' looks like a `COME FROM'
   statement.  After the terminating statement number/`CONTINUE'
   is reached, control continues at the statement following the DO.
   Some generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than
   `CONTINUE') for the statement, leading to examples like:

           DO 10 I=1,LIMIT
     C imagine many lines of code here, leaving the
     C original DO statement lost in the spaghetti...
           WRITE(6,10) I,FROB(I)
      10   FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4)

   in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10.
   (This is particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear
   to have anything to do with the flow of control at all!)

   While sufficiently astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this
   form of `COME FROM' statement isn't completely general.  After
   all, control will eventually pass to the following statement.  The
   implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN,
   ca. 1975 (though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040
   ten years earlier).  The statement `AT 100' would perform a
   `COME FROM 100'.  It was intended strictly as a debugging aid,
   with dire consequences promised to anyone so deranged as to use it
   in production code.  More horrible things had already been
   perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only
   contemplate the `ALTER' verb in @{"COBOL" LINK "jarg_C" 592}.

   `COME FROM' was supported under its own name for the first
   time 15 years later, in C-INTERCAL (see @{"INTERCAL" LINK "jarg_I" 312},
   @{"retrocomputing" LINK "jarg_R" 458}); knowledgeable observers are still reeling
   from the shock.

@{b}comm mode@{ub} /kom mohd/ n.  [ITS: from the feature supporting
   on-line chat; the term may spelled with one or two m's] Syn. for
   @{"talk mode" LINK "jarg_T" 19}.

@{b}command key@{ub} n.  [Mac users] Syn. @{"feature key" LINK "jarg_F" 214}.

@{b}comment out@{ub} vt.  To surround a section of code with comment
   delimiters or to prefix every line in the section with a comment
   marker; this prevents it from being compiled or interpreted.  Often
   done when the code is redundant or obsolete, but is being left in
   the source to make the intent of the active code clearer; also when
   the code in that section is broken and you want to bypass it in
   order to debug some other part of the code.  Compare @{"condition out" LINK "jarg_C" 889},
   usually the preferred technique in languages (such as @{"C" LINK "jarg_C" 1})
   that make it possible.

@{b}@{u}Commonwealth Hackish@{uu}@{ub} n.  Hacker jargon as spoken outside
   the U.S., esp. in the British Commonwealth.  It is reported that
   Commonwealth speakers are more likely to pronounce truncations like
   `char' and `soc', etc., as spelled (/char/, /sok/), as
   opposed to American /keir/ and /sohsh/.  Dots in @{"newsgroup" LINK "jarg_N" 412}
   names (especially two-component names) tend to be pronounced more
   often (so soc.wibble is /sok dot wib'l/ rather than /sohsh
   wib'l/).  The prefix @{"meta" LINK "jarg_M" 486} may be pronounced /mee't*/;
   similarly, Greek letter beta is usually /bee't*/, zeta is usually
   /zee't*/, and so forth.  Preferred @{"metasyntactic variable" LINK "jarg_M" 507}s
   include @{"blurgle" LINK "jarg_B" 1217}, `eek', `ook', `frodo', and
   `bilbo'; @{"wibble" LINK "jarg_W" 458}, `wobble', and in emergencies
   `wubble'; `flob', `banana', `tom', `dick',
   `harry', `wombat', `frog', @{"fish" LINK "jarg_F" 539}, and so on and
   on (see @{"foo" LINK "jarg_F" 825}, sense 4).

   Alternatives to verb doubling include suffixes `-o-rama',
   `frenzy' (as in feeding frenzy), and `city' (examples: "barf
   city!"  "hack-o-rama!"  "core dump frenzy!").  Finally, note
   that the American terms `parens', `brackets', and `braces' for (),
   [], and {} are uncommon; Commonwealth hackish prefers
   `brackets', `square brackets', and `curly brackets'.  Also, the
   use of `pling' for @{"bang" LINK "jarg_B" 202} is common outside the United States.

@{b}compact@{ub} adj.  Of a design, describes the valuable property
   that it can all be apprehended at once in one's head.  This
   generally means the thing created from the design can be used with
   greater facility and fewer errors than an equivalent tool that is
   not compact.  Compactness does not imply triviality or lack of
   power; for example, C is compact and FORTRAN is not, but C is more
   powerful than FORTRAN.  Designs become non-compact through
   accreting @{"feature" LINK "jarg_F" 151}s and @{"cruft" LINK "jarg_C" 1508} that don't merge cleanly
   into the overall design scheme (thus, some fans of @{"Classic C" LINK "jarg_C" 522}
   maintain that ANSI C is no longer compact).

@{b}compiler jock@{ub} n.  See @{"jock" LINK "jarg_J" 95} (sense 2).

@{b}compress@{ub} [Unix] vt.  When used without a qualifier,
   generally refers to @{"crunch" LINK "jarg_C" 1556}ing of a file using a particular C
   implementation of compression by James A. Woods et al. and widely
   circulated via @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190}; use of @{"crunch" LINK "jarg_C" 1556} itself in this sense
   is rare among Unix hackers.  Specifically, compress is built around
   the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm as described in "A Technique for
   High Performance Data Compression", Terry A. Welch, "IEEE
   Computer", vol. 17, no. 6 (June 1984), pp. 8--19.

@{b}Compu$erve@{ub} n.  See @{"CI$" LINK "jarg_C" 517}.  Synonyms CompuSpend and
   Compu$pend are also reported.

@{b}computer confetti@{ub} n.  Syn. @{"chad" LINK "jarg_C" 284}.  Though this term is
   common, this use of punched-card chad is not a good idea, as the
   pieces are stiff and have sharp corners that could injure the eyes.
   GLS reports that he once attended a wedding at MIT during which he
   and a few other guests enthusiastically threw chad instead of
   rice. The groom later grumbled that he and his bride had spent most
   of the evening trying to get the stuff out of their hair.

@{b}computer geek@{ub} n.  1. One who eats (computer) bugs for a
   living.  One who fulfills all the dreariest negative stereotypes
   about hackers: an asocial, malodorous, pasty-faced monomaniac with
   all the personality of a cheese grater.  Cannot be used by
   outsiders without implied insult to all hackers; compare
   black-on-black usage of `nigger'.  A computer geek may be either
   a fundamentally clueless individual or a proto-hacker in 
   @{"larval stage" LINK "jarg_L" 61}.  Also called `turbo nerd', `turbo geek'.  See also
   @{"propeller head" LINK "jarg_P" 966}, @{"clustergeeking" LINK "jarg_C" 588}, @{"geek out" LINK "jarg_G" 156},
   @{"wannabee" LINK "jarg_W" 150}, @{"terminal junkie" LINK "jarg_T" 451}, @{"spod" LINK "jarg_S" 1502}, @{"weenie" LINK "jarg_W" 339}.
   2. Some self-described computer geeks use this term in a positive
   sense and protest sense 1 (this seems to be a post-1990
   development).

@{b}computron@{ub} /kom'pyoo-tron`/  n. 1. A notional unit of
   computing power combining instruction speed and storage capacity,
   dimensioned roughly in instructions-per-second times
   megabytes-of-main-store times megabytes-of-mass-storage.  "That
   machine can't run GNU Emacs, it doesn't have enough computrons!"
   This usage is usually found in metaphors that treat computing power
   as a fungible commodity good, like a crop yield or diesel
   horsepower.  See @{"bitty box" LINK "jarg_B" 924}, @{"Get a real computer!" LINK "jarg_G" 229},
   @{"toy" LINK "jarg_T" 913}, @{"crank" LINK "jarg_C" 1293}.  2. A mythical subatomic particle that bears
   the unit quantity of computation or information, in much the same
   way that an electron bears one unit of electric charge (see also
   @{"bogon" LINK "jarg_B" 1319}).  An elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons
   has been developed based on the physical fact that the molecules in
   a solid object move more rapidly as it is heated.  It is argued
   that an object melts because the molecules have lost their
   information about where they are supposed to be (that is, they have
   emitted computrons).  This explains why computers get so hot and
   require air conditioning; they use up computrons.  Conversely, it
   should be possible to cool down an object by placing it in the path
   of a computron beam.  It is believed that this may also explain why
   machines that work at the factory fail in the computer room: the
   computrons there have been all used up by the other hardware.
   (This theory probably owes something to the "Warlock" stories
   by Larry Niven, the best known being "What Good is a Glass
   Dagger?", in which magic is fueled by an exhaustible natural
   resource called `mana'.)

@{b}con@{ub} [from SF fandom] n.  A science-fiction convention.  Not
   used of other sorts of conventions, such as professional meetings.
   This term, unlike many others of SF-fan slang, is widely recognized
   even by hackers who aren't @{"fan" LINK "jarg_F" 51}s. "We'd been corresponding on
   the net for months, then we met face-to-face at a con."

@{b}condition out@{ub} vt.  To prevent a section of code from being
   compiled by surrounding it with a conditional-compilation directive
   whose condition is always false.  The @{"canonical" LINK "jarg_C" 89} examples of
   these directives are `#if 0' (or `#ifdef notdef', though
   some find the latter @{"bletcherous" LINK "jarg_B" 993}) and `#endif' in C.
   Compare @{"comment out" LINK "jarg_C" 761}.

@{b}condom@{ub} n.  1. The protective plastic bag that accompanies
   3.5-inch microfloppy diskettes.  Rarely, also used of (paper) disk
   envelopes.  Unlike the write protect tab, the condom (when left on)
   not only impedes the practice of @{"SEX" LINK "jarg_S" 585} but has also been shown
   to have a high failure rate as drive mechanisms attempt to access
   the disk -- and can even fatally frustrate insertion.  2. The
   protective cladding on a @{"light pipe" LINK "jarg_L" 213}.  3. `keyboard condom':
   A flexible, transparent plastic cover for a keyboard, designed to
   provide some protection against dust and @{"programming fluid" LINK "jarg_P" 962}
   without impeding typing.  4. `elephant condom': the plastic
   shipping bags used inside cardboard boxes to protect hardware in
   transit.  5. n.,obs. A dummy directory `/usr/tmp/sh', created
   to foil the Great Worm by exploiting a portability bug in one
   of its parts.  So named in the title of a comp.risks article by
   Gene Spafford during the Worm crisis, and again in the text of
   "The Internet Worm Program: An Analysis", Purdue Technical
   Report CSD-TR-823.  See @{"Great Worm, the" LINK "jarg_G" 614}.

@{b}confuser@{ub} n.  Common soundalike slang for `computer'.
   Usually encountered in compounds such as `confuser room',
   `personal confuser', `confuser guru'.  Usage: silly.

@{b}connector conspiracy@{ub} n.  [probably came into prominence with
   the appearance of the KL-10 (one model of the @{"PDP-10" LINK "jarg_P" 264}), none of
   whose connectors matched anything else] The tendency of
   manufacturers (or, by extension, programmers or purveyors of
   anything) to come up with new products that don't fit together with
   the old stuff, thereby making you buy either all new stuff or
   expensive interface devices.  The KL-10 Massbus connector was
   actually *patented* by @{"DEC" LINK "jarg_D" 246}, which reputedly refused to
   license the design and thus effectively locked third parties out of
   competition for the lucrative Massbus peripherals market.  This
   policy is a source of never-ending frustration for the diehards who
   maintain older PDP-10 or VAX systems.  Their CPUs work fine, but
   they are stuck with dying, obsolescent disk and tape drives with
   low capacity and high power requirements.

   (A closely related phenomenon, with a slightly different intent, is
   the habit manufacturers have of inventing new screw heads so that
   only Designated Persons, possessing the magic screwdrivers, can
   remove covers and make repairs or install options.  A good 1990s
   example is the invention of Torx screws for cable-TV set-top boxes.
   Older Apple Macintoshes took this one step further, requiring not
   only a hex wrench but a specialized case-cracking tool to open the
   box.)

   In these latter days of open-systems computing this term has fallen
   somewhat into disuse, to be replaced by the observation that
   "Standards are great!  There are so *many* of them to choose
   from!"  Compare @{"backward combatability" LINK "jarg_B" 90}.

@{b}cons@{ub} /konz/ or /kons/  [from LISP] 1. vt. To add a new
   element to a specified list, esp. at the top.  "OK, cons picking
   a replacement for the console TTY onto the agenda."  2. `cons
   up': vt. To synthesize from smaller pieces: "to cons up an
   example".

   In LISP itself, `cons' is the most fundamental operation for
   building structures.  It takes any two objects and returns a
   `dot-pair' or two-branched tree with one object hanging from each
   branch.  Because the result of a cons is an object, it can be used
   to build binary trees of any shape and complexity.  Hackers think
   of it as a sort of universal constructor, and that is where the
   jargon meanings spring from.

@{b}considered harmful@{ub} adj.  Edsger W. Dijkstra's note in the
   March 1968 "Communications of the ACM", "Goto Statement
   Considered Harmful", fired the first salvo in the structured
   programming wars.  Amusingly, the ACM considered the resulting
   acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no longer
   print an article taking so assertive a position against a coding
   practice.  In the ensuing decades, a large number of both serious
   papers and parodies have borne titles of the form "X
   considered Y".  The structured-programming wars eventually blew
   over with the realization that both sides were wrong, but use of
   such titles has remained as a persistent minor in-joke (the
   `considered silly' found at various places in this lexicon is
   related).

@{b}@{u}console@{uu}@{ub} n.  1. The operator's station of a @{"mainframe" LINK "jarg_M" 210}.
   In times past, this was a privileged location that conveyed godlike
   powers to anyone with fingers on its keys.  Under Unix and other
   modern timesharing OSes, such privileges are guarded by passwords
   instead, and the console is just the @{"tty" LINK "jarg_T" 1101} the system was booted
   from.  Some of the mystique remains, however, and it is traditional
   for sysadmins to post urgent messages to all users from the console
   (on Unix, /dev/console).  2. On microcomputer Unix boxes, the main
   screen and keyboard (as opposed to character-only terminals talking
   to a serial port).  Typically only the console can do real graphics
   or run @{"X" LINK "jarg_X" 1}.  See also @{"CTY" LINK "jarg_C" 1595}.

@{b}console jockey@{ub} n.  See @{"terminal junkie" LINK "jarg_T" 451}.

@{b}content-free@{ub} adj.  [by analogy with techspeak
   `context-free'] Used of a message that adds nothing to the
   recipient's knowledge.  Though this adjective is sometimes applied
   to @{"flamage" LINK "jarg_F" 594}, it more usually connotes derision for
   communication styles that exalt form over substance or are centered
   on concerns irrelevant to the subject ostensibly at hand.  Perhaps
   most used with reference to speeches by company presidents and
   other professional manipulators.  "Content-free?  Uh... that's
   anything printed on glossy paper."  (See also @{"four-color glossies" LINK "jarg_F" 1095}.)
   "He gave a talk on the implications of electronic
   networks for postmodernism and the fin-de-siecle aesthetic.  It was
   content-free."

@{b}control-C@{ub} vi.  1. "Stop whatever you are doing."  From the
   interrupt character used on many operating systems to abort a
   running program.  Considered silly.  2. interj. Among BSD Unix
   hackers, the canonical humorous response to "Give me a break!"

@{b}control-O@{ub} vi.  "Stop talking."  From the character used on
   some operating systems to abort output but allow the program to
   keep on running.  Generally means that you are not interested in
   hearing anything more from that person, at least on that topic; a
   standard response to someone who is flaming.  Considered silly.
   Compare @{"control-S" LINK "jarg_C" 1018}.

@{b}control-Q@{ub} vi.  "Resume."  From the ASCII DC1 or @{"XON" LINK "jarg_X" 32}
   character (the pronunciation /X-on/ is therefore also used), used
   to undo a previous @{"control-S" LINK "jarg_C" 1018}.

@{b}control-S@{ub} vi.  "Stop talking for a second."  From the
   ASCII DC3 or XOFF character (the pronunciation /X-of/ is
   therefore also used).  Control-S differs from @{"control-O" LINK "jarg_C" 1007} in
   that the person is asked to stop talking (perhaps because you are
   on the phone) but will be allowed to continue when you're ready to
   listen to him -- as opposed to control-O, which has more of the
   meaning of "Shut up."  Considered silly.

@{b}Conway's Law@{ub} prov.  The rule that the organization of the
   software and the organization of the software team will be
   congruent; originally stated as "If you have four groups working
   on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler".

   The law was named after Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who
   wrote an assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE.  (The name
   `SAVE' didn't stand for anything; it was just that you lost fewer
   card decks and listings because they all had SAVE written on them.)

@{b}cookbook@{ub} n.  [from amateur electronics and radio] A book of small
   code segments that the reader can use to do various @{"magic" LINK "jarg_M" 76}
   things in programs.  One current example is the
   "@{"PostScript" LINK "jarg_P" 817} Language Tutorial and Cookbook" by Adobe
   Systems, Inc (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-10179-3), also known as
   the @{"Blue Book" LINK "jarg_B" 1165} which has recipes for things like wrapping text
   around arbitrary curves and making 3D fonts.  Cookbooks, slavishly
   followed, can lead one into @{"voodoo programming" LINK "jarg_V" 390}, but are useful
   for hackers trying to @{"monkey up" LINK "jarg_M" 904} small programs in unknown
   languages.  This function is analogous to the role of phrasebooks
   in human languages.

@{b}cooked mode@{ub} n.  [Unix, by opposition from @{"raw mode" LINK "jarg_R" 152}] The
   normal character-input mode, with interrupts enabled and with
   erase, kill and other special-character interpretations performed
   directly by the tty driver.  Oppose @{"raw mode" LINK "jarg_R" 152}, @{"rare mode" LINK "jarg_R" 103}.
   This term is techspeak under Unix but jargon elsewhere; other
   operating systems often have similar mode distinctions, and the
   raw/rare/cooked way of describing them has spread widely along with
   the C language and other Unix exports.  Most generally, `cooked
   mode' may refer to any mode of a system that does extensive
   preprocessing before presenting data to a program.

@{b}cookie@{ub} n.  A handle, transaction ID, or other token of
   agreement between cooperating programs.  "I give him a packet, he
   gives me back a cookie."  The claim check you get from a
   dry-cleaning shop is a perfect mundane example of a cookie; the
   only thing it's useful for is to relate a later transaction to this
   one (so you get the same clothes back).  Compare @{"magic cookie" LINK "jarg_M" 91};
   see also @{"fortune cookie" LINK "jarg_F" 1058}.

@{b}cookie bear@{ub} n.,obs.  Original term, pre-Sesame-Street, for
   what is now universally called a @{"cookie monster" LINK "jarg_C" 1092}. A
   correspondent observes "In those days, hackers were actually
   getting their yucks from...sit down now...Andy Williams.
   Yes, *that* Andy Williams.  Seems he had a rather hip (by the
   standards of the day) TV variety show. One of the best parts of the
   show was the recurring `cookie bear' sketch. In these sketches, a
   guy in a bear suit tried all sorts of tricks to get a cookie out of
   Williams. The sketches would always end with Williams shrieking
   (and I don't mean figuratively), `No cookies! Not now, not
   ever...NEVER!!!' And the bear would fall down.  Great stuff.

@{b}cookie file@{ub} n.  A collection of @{"fortune cookie" LINK "jarg_F" 1058}s in a
   format that facilitates retrieval by a fortune program.  There are
   several different cookie files in public distribution, and site
   admins often assemble their own from various sources including this
   lexicon.

@{b}cookie jar@{ub} n.  An area of memory set aside for storing
   @{"cookie" LINK "jarg_C" 1059}s.  Most commonly heard in the Atari ST community; many
   useful ST programs record their presence by storing a distinctive
   @{"magic number" LINK "jarg_M" 109} in the jar.  Programs can inquire after the
   presence or otherwise of other programs by searching the contents
   of the jar.

@{b}cookie monster@{ub} n.  [from the children's TV program
   "Sesame Street"] Any of a family of early (1970s) hacks
   reported on @{"TOPS-10" LINK "jarg_T" 881}, @{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463}, @{"Multics" LINK "jarg_M" 1145}, and elsewhere
   that would lock up either the victim's terminal (on a time-sharing
   machine) or the @{"console" LINK "jarg_C" 975} (on a batch @{"mainframe" LINK "jarg_M" 210}),
   repeatedly demanding "I WANT A COOKIE".  The required responses
   ranged in complexity from "COOKIE" through "HAVE A COOKIE" and
   upward.  Folklorist Jan Brunvand (see @{"FOAF" LINK "jarg_F" 781}) has described
   these programs as urban legends (implying they probably never
   existed) but they existed, all right, in several different
   versions.  See also @{"wabbit" LINK "jarg_W" 1}.  Interestingly, the term `cookie
   monster' appears to be a @{"retcon" LINK "jarg_R" 431}; the original term was
   @{"cookie bear" LINK "jarg_C" 1067}.

@{b}copious free time@{ub} n.  [Apple; orig. fr. the intro to Tom
   Lehrer's song "It Makes A Fellow Proud To Be A Soldier"]
   1. [used ironically to indicate the speaker's lack of the quantity
   in question] A mythical schedule slot for accomplishing tasks held
   to be unlikely or impossible.  Sometimes used to indicate that the
   speaker is interested in accomplishing the task, but believes that
   the opportunity will not arise.  "I'll implement the automatic
   layout stuff in my copious free time."  2. [Archly] Time reserved
   for bogus or otherwise idiotic tasks, such as implementation of
   @{"chrome" LINK "jarg_C" 489}, or the stroking of @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}s.  "I'll get back to him
   on that feature in my copious free time."

@{b}copper@{ub} n.  Conventional electron-carrying network cable with
   a core conductor of copper -- or aluminum!  Opposed to 
   @{"light pipe" LINK "jarg_L" 213} or, say, a short-range microwave link.

@{b}copy protection@{ub} n.  A class of methods for preventing
   incompetent pirates from stealing software and legitimate customers
   from using it.  Considered silly.

@{b}copybroke@{ub} /kop'ee-brohk/ adj.  1. [play on `copyright']
   Used to describe an instance of a copy-protected program that has
   been `broken'; that is, a copy with the copy-protection scheme
   disabled.  Syn.  @{"copywronged" LINK "jarg_C" 1140}.  2. Copy-protected software
   which is unusable because of some bit-rot or bug that has confused
   the anti-piracy check.  See also @{"copy protection" LINK "jarg_C" 1122}.

@{b}copyleft@{ub} /kop'ee-left/ n.  [play on `copyright'] 1. The
   copyright notice (`General Public License') carried by @{"GNU" LINK "jarg_G" 383}
   @{"EMACS" LINK "jarg_E" 185} and other Free Software Foundation software, granting reuse
   and reproduction rights to all comers (but see also 
   @{"General Public Virus" LINK "jarg_G" 177}).  2. By extension, any copyright notice 
   intended to achieve similar aims.

@{b}copywronged@{ub} /kop'ee-rongd/ adj.  [play on `copyright']
   Syn. for @{"copybroke" LINK "jarg_C" 1126}.

@{b}core@{ub} n.  Main storage or RAM.  Dates from the days of
   ferrite-core memory; now archaic as techspeak most places outside
   IBM, but also still used in the Unix community and by old-time
   hackers or those who would sound like them.  Some derived idioms
   are quite current; `in core', for example, means `in memory'
   (as opposed to `on disk'), and both @{"core dump" LINK "jarg_C" 1156} and the `core
   image' or `core file' produced by one are terms in favor.  Some
   varieties of Commonwealth hackish prefer @{"store" LINK "jarg_S" 1685}.

@{b}core cancer@{ub} n.  A process that exhibits a slow but
   inexorable resource @{"leak" LINK "jarg_L" 114} -- like a cancer, it kills by
   crowding out productive `tissue'.

@{b}core dump@{ub} n.  [common @{"Iron Age" LINK "jarg_I" 433} jargon, preserved by
   Unix] 1. [techspeak] A copy of the contents of @{"core" LINK "jarg_C" 1143}, produced
   when a process is aborted by certain kinds of internal error.
   2. By extension, used for humans passing out, vomiting, or
   registering extreme shock.  "He dumped core.  All over the floor.
   What a mess."  "He heard about X and dumped core."
   3. Occasionally used for a human rambling on pointlessly at great
   length; esp. in apology: "Sorry, I dumped core on you".  4. A
   recapitulation of knowledge (compare @{"bits" LINK "jarg_B" 916}, sense 1).  Hence,
   spewing all one knows about a topic (syn. @{"brain dump" LINK "jarg_B" 1620}), esp.
   in a lecture or answer to an exam question.  "Short, concise
   answers are better than core dumps" (from the instructions to an
   exam at Columbia).  See @{"core" LINK "jarg_C" 1143}.

@{b}core leak@{ub} n.  Syn. @{"memory leak" LINK "jarg_M" 448}.

@{b}Core Wars@{ub} n.  A game between `assembler' programs in a
   simulated machine, where the objective is to kill your opponent's
   program by overwriting it.  Popularized by A. K. Dewdney's column
   in "Scientific American" magazine, this was actually devised
   by Victor Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and Dennis Ritchie in the
   early 1960s (their original game was called `Darwin' and ran on a
   PDP-1 at Bell Labs).  See @{"core" LINK "jarg_C" 1143}.

@{b}corge@{ub} /korj/ n.  [originally, the name of a cat] Yet
   another @{"metasyntactic variable" LINK "jarg_M" 507}, invented by Mike Gallaher and
   propagated by the @{"GOSMACS" LINK "jarg_G" 538} documentation.  See @{"grault" LINK "jarg_G" 567}.

@{b}cosmic rays@{ub} n.  Notionally, the cause of @{"bit rot" LINK "jarg_B" 823}.
   However, this is a semi-independent usage that may be invoked as a
   humorous way to @{"handwave" LINK "jarg_H" 408} away any minor @{"randomness" LINK "jarg_R" 80} that
   doesn't seem worth the bother of investigating.  "Hey, Eric -- I
   just got a burst of garbage on my @{"tube" LINK "jarg_T" 1114}, where did that come
   from?"  "Cosmic rays, I guess."  Compare @{"sunspots" LINK "jarg_S" 1792},
   @{"phase of the moon" LINK "jarg_P" 430}.  The British seem to prefer the usage
   `cosmic showers'; `alpha particles' is also heard, because
   stray alpha particles passing through a memory chip can cause
   single-bit errors (this becomes increasingly more likely as memory
   sizes and densities increase).

   Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not
   (except occasionally in spaceborne computers).  Intel could not
   explain random bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis
   was cosmic rays.  So they created the World's Largest Lead Safe,
   using 25 tons of the stuff, and used two identical boards for
   testing.  One was placed in the safe, one outside.  The hypothesis
   was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit drops, they should see
   a statistically significant difference between the error rates on
   the two boards.  They did not observe such a difference.  Further
   investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due
   to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser
   degree uranium) in the encapsulation material.  Since it is
   impossible to eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly
   distributed through the earth's crust, with the statistically
   insignificant exception of uranium lodes) it became obvious that
   one has to design memories to withstand these hits.

@{b}cough and die@{ub} v.  Syn. @{"barf" LINK "jarg_B" 294}.  Connotes that the program
   is throwing its hands up by design rather than because of a bug or
   oversight.  "The parser saw a control-A in its input where it was
   looking for a printable, so it coughed and died."  Compare
   @{"die" LINK "jarg_D" 517}, @{"die horribly" LINK "jarg_D" 521}, @{"scream and die" LINK "jarg_S" 387}.

@{b}cowboy@{ub} n.  [Sun, from William Gibson's @{"cyberpunk" LINK "jarg_C" 1658} SF]
   Synonym for @{"hacker" LINK "jarg_H" 135}.  It is reported that at Sun this word is
   often said with reverence.

@{b}@{u}CP/M@{uu}@{ub} /C-P-M/ n.  [Control Program/Monitor; later
   @{"retcon" LINK "jarg_R" 431}ned to Control Program for Microcomputers] An early
   microcomputer @{"OS" LINK "jarg_O" 304} written by hacker Gary Kildall for 8080- and
   Z80-based machines, very popular in the late 1970s but virtually
   wiped out by MS-DOS after the release of the IBM PC in 1981.
   Legend has it that Kildall's company blew its chance to write the
   OS for the IBM PC because Kildall decided to spend a day IBM's reps
   wanted to meet with him enjoying the perfect flying weather in his
   private plane.  Many of CP/M's features and conventions strongly
   resemble those of early @{"DEC" LINK "jarg_D" 246} operating systems such as
   @{"TOPS-10" LINK "jarg_T" 881}, OS/8, RSTS, and RSX-11.  See @{"MS-DOS" LINK "jarg_M" 1016},
   @{"operating system" LINK "jarg_O" 228}.

@{b}CPU Wars@{ub} /C-P-U worz/ n.  A 1979 large-format comic by
   Chas Andres chronicling the attempts of the brainwashed androids of
   IPM (Impossible to Program Machines) to conquer and destroy the
   peaceful denizens of HEC (Human Engineered Computers).  This rather
   transparent allegory featured many references to @{"ADVENT" LINK "jarg_A" 111} and
   the immortal line "Eat flaming death, minicomputer mongrels!"
   (uttered, of course, by an IPM stormtrooper).  It is alleged that
   the author subsequently received a letter of appreciation on IBM
   company stationery from the head of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
   Laboratories (then, as now, one of the few islands of true
   hackerdom in the IBM archipelago).  The lower loop of the B in the
   IBM logo, it is said, had been carefully whited out. See 
   @{"eat flaming death" LINK "jarg_E" 26}.

@{b}crack root@{ub} v.  To defeat the security system of a Unix
   machine and gain @{"root" LINK "jarg_R" 583} privileges thereby; see @{"cracking" LINK "jarg_C" 1285}.

@{b}cracker@{ub} n.  One who breaks security on a system.  Coined
   ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of
   @{"hacker" LINK "jarg_H" 135} (q.v., sense 8).  An earlier attempt to establish
   `worm' in this sense around 1981--82 on Usenet was largely a
   failure.

   Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against
   the theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings.  While it is
   expected that any real hacker will have done some playful cracking
   and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past @{"larval stage" LINK "jarg_L" 61}
   is expected to have outgrown the desire to do so except for
   immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example, if it's
   necessary to get around some security in order to get some work
   done).

   Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom
   than the @{"mundane" LINK "jarg_M" 1237} reader misled by sensationalistic journalism
   might expect.  Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit, very
   secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
   poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to
   describe *themselves* as hackers, most true hackers consider
   them a separate and lower form of life.

   Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't
   imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than
   breaking into someone else's has to be pretty @{"losing" LINK "jarg_L" 568}.  Some
   other reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the
   entries on @{"cracking" LINK "jarg_C" 1285} and @{"phreaking" LINK "jarg_P" 461}.  See also
   @{"samurai" LINK "jarg_S" 249}, @{"dark-side hacker" LINK "jarg_D" 54}, and @{"hacker ethic, the" LINK "jarg_H" 167}. 
   For a portrait of the typical teenage cracker, see
   @{"warez" LINK "jarg_W" 194}.

@{b}cracking@{ub} n.  The act of breaking into a computer system;
   what a @{"cracker" LINK "jarg_C" 1253} does.  Contrary to widespread myth, this does
   not usually involve some mysterious leap of hackerly brilliance,
   but rather persistence and the dogged repetition of a handful of
   fairly well-known tricks that exploit common weaknesses in the
   security of target systems.  Accordingly, most crackers are only
   mediocre hackers.

@{b}crank@{ub} vt.  [from automotive slang] Verb used to describe the
   performance of a machine, especially sustained performance.  "This
   box cranks (or, cranks at) about 6 megaflops, with a burst mode of
   twice that on vectorized operations."

@{b}CrApTeX@{ub} /krap'tekh/ n.  [University of York, England] Term
   of abuse used to describe TeX and LaTeX when they don't work (when
   used by TeXhackers), or all the time (by everyone else).  The
   non-TeX-enthusiasts generally dislike it because it is more verbose
   than other formatters (e.g. @{"troff" LINK "jarg_T" 1016}) and because (particularly
   if the standard Computer Modern fonts are used) it generates vast
   output files.  See @{"religious issues" LINK "jarg_R" 388}, @{"TeX" LINK "jarg_T" 476}.

@{b}crash@{ub}  1. n. A sudden, usually drastic failure.  Most often
   said of the @{"system" LINK "jarg_S" 1950} (q.v., sense 1), esp. of magnetic disk
   drives (the term originally described what happened when the air
   gap of a hard disk collapses).  "Three @{"luser" LINK "jarg_L" 638}s lost their
   files in last night's disk crash."  A disk crash that involves the
   read/write heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and
   scraping off the oxide may also be referred to as a `head crash',
   whereas the term `system crash' usually, though not always,
   implies that the operating system or other software was at fault.
   2. v. To fail suddenly.  "Has the system just crashed?"
   "Something crashed the OS!" See @{"down" LINK "jarg_D" 890}.  Also used
   transitively to indicate the cause of the crash (usually a person
   or a program, or both).  "Those idiots playing @{"SPACEWAR" LINK "jarg_S" 1378}
   crashed the system." 3. vi.  Sometimes said of people hitting the
   sack after a long @{"hacking run" LINK "jarg_H" 203}; see @{"gronk out" LINK "jarg_G" 791}.

@{b}crash and burn@{ub} vi.,n.  A spectacular crash, in the mode of
   the conclusion of the car-chase scene in the movie "Bullitt"
   and many subsequent imitators (compare @{"die horribly" LINK "jarg_D" 521}).  Sun-3
   monitors losing the flyback transformer and lightning strikes on
   VAX-11/780 backplanes are notable crash and burn generators.  The
   construction `crash-and-burn machine' is reported for a computer
   used exclusively for alpha or @{"beta" LINK "jarg_B" 512} testing, or reproducing
   bugs (i.e., not for development).  The implication is that it
   wouldn't be such a disaster if that machine crashed, since only the
   testers would be inconvenienced.

@{b}crawling horror@{ub} n.  Ancient crufty hardware or software that
   is kept obstinately alive by forces beyond the control of the
   hackers at a site.  Like @{"dusty deck" LINK "jarg_D" 1175} or @{"gonkulator" LINK "jarg_G" 469}, but
   connotes that the thing described is not just an irritation but an
   active menace to health and sanity.  "Mostly we code new stuff in
   C, but they pay us to maintain one big FORTRAN II application from
   nineteen-sixty-X that's a real crawling horror...." Compare
   @{"WOMBAT" LINK "jarg_W" 631}.

@{b}cray@{ub} /kray/ n.  1. (properly, capitalized) One of the line
   of supercomputers designed by Cray Research.  2. Any supercomputer
   at all.  3. The @{"canonical" LINK "jarg_C" 89} @{"number-crunching" LINK "jarg_N" 655} machine.

   The term is actually the lowercased last name of Seymour Cray, a
   noted computer architect and co-founder of the company.  Numerous
   vivid legends surround him, some true and some admittedly invented
   by Cray Research brass to shape their corporate culture and image.

@{b}cray instability@{ub} n.  1. A shortcoming of a program or
   algorithm that manifests itself only when a large problem is being
   run on a powerful machine (see @{"cray" LINK "jarg_C" 1342}).  Generally more subtle
   than bugs that can be detected in smaller problems running on a
   workstation or mini.  2. More specifically, a shortcoming of
   algorithms which are well behaved when run on gentle floating point
   hardware (such as IEEE-standard or DEC) but which break down badly
   when exposed to a Cray's unique `rounding' rules.

@{b}crayola@{ub} /kray-oh'l*/ n.  A super-mini or -micro computer
   that provides some reasonable percentage of supercomputer
   performance for an unreasonably low price.  Might also be a
   @{"killer micro" LINK "jarg_K" 81}.

@{b}crayola books@{ub} n.  The @{"rainbow series" LINK "jarg_R" 17} of National
   Computer Security Center (NCSC) computer security standards (see
   @{"Orange Book" LINK "jarg_O" 261}).  Usage: humorous and/or disparaging.

@{b}crayon@{ub} n.  1. Someone who works on Cray supercomputers.
   More specifically, it implies a programmer, probably of the CDC
   ilk, probably male, and almost certainly wearing a tie
   (irrespective of gender).  Systems types who have a Unix background
   tend not to be described as crayons.  2. A @{"computron" LINK "jarg_C" 856} (sense 2)
   that participates only in @{"number-crunching" LINK "jarg_N" 655}.  3. A unit of
   computational power equal to that of a single Cray-1.  There is a
   standard joke about this usage that derives from an old Crayola
   crayon promotional gimmick: When you buy 64 crayons you get a free
   sharpener.

@{b}creationism@{ub} n.  The (false) belief that large, innovative
   software designs can be completely specified in advance and then
   painlessly magicked out of the void by the normal efforts of a team
   of normally talented programmers.  In fact, experience has shown
   repeatedly that good designs arise only from evolutionary,
   exploratory interaction between one (or at most a small handful of)
   exceptionally able designer(s) and an active user population ---
   and that the first try at a big new idea is always wrong.
   Unfortunately, because these truths don't fit the planning models
   beloved of @{"management" LINK "jarg_M" 232}, they are generally ignored.

@{b}creep@{ub} v.  To advance, grow, or multiply inexorably.  In
   hackish usage this verb has overtones of menace and silliness,
   evoking the creeping horrors of low-budget monster movies.

@{b}creeping elegance@{ub} n.  Describes a tendency for parts of a
   design to become @{"elegant" LINK "jarg_E" 108} past the point of diminishing return,
   something which often happens at the expense of the less
   interesting parts of the design, the schedule, and other things
   deemed important in the @{"Real World" LINK "jarg_R" 267}.  See also @{"creeping featurism" LINK "jarg_C" 1402},
   @{"second-system effect" LINK "jarg_S" 462}, @{"tense" LINK "jarg_T" 401}.

@{b}creeping featurism@{ub} /kree'ping fee'chr-izm/ n. 
   1. Describes a systematic tendency to load more @{"chrome" LINK "jarg_C" 489} and
   @{"feature" LINK "jarg_F" 151}s onto systems at the expense of whatever elegance they
   may have possessed when originally designed.  See also 
   @{"feeping creaturism" LINK "jarg_F" 280}.  "You know, the main problem with @{"BSD" LINK "jarg_B" 1854} Unix 
   has always been creeping featurism."  2. More generally, the tendency
   for anything complicated to become even more complicated because
   people keep saying "Gee, it would be even better if it had this
   feature too".  (See @{"feature" LINK "jarg_F" 151}.)  The result is usually a
   patchwork because it grew one ad-hoc step at a time, rather than
   being planned.  Planning is a lot of work, but it's easy to add
   just one extra little feature to help someone ... and then
   another ... and another.... When creeping featurism gets
   out of hand, it's like a cancer.  Usually this term is used to
   describe computer programs, but it could also be said of the
   federal government, the IRS 1040 form, and new cars.  A similar
   phenomenon sometimes afflicts conscious redesigns; see
   @{"second-system effect" LINK "jarg_S" 462}.  See also @{"creeping elegance" LINK "jarg_C" 1395}.

@{b}creeping featuritis@{ub} /kree'ping fee'-chr-i:`t*s/ n. 
   Variant of @{"creeping featurism" LINK "jarg_C" 1402}, with its own spoonerization:
   `feeping creaturitis'.  Some people like to reserve this form for
   the disease as it actually manifests in software or hardware, as
   opposed to the lurking general tendency in designers' minds.
   (After all, -ism means `condition' or `pursuit of', whereas
   -itis usually means `inflammation of'.)

@{b}cretin@{ub} /kret'in/ or /kree'tn/ n.  Congenital @{"loser" LINK "jarg_L" 561};
   an obnoxious person; someone who can't do anything right.  It has
   been observed that many American hackers tend to favor the British
   pronunciation /kret'in/ over standard American /kree'tn/; it is
   thought this may be due to the insidious phonetic influence of
   Monty Python's Flying Circus.

@{b}cretinous@{ub} /kret'n-*s/ or /kreet'n-*s/ adj.  Wrong;
   stupid; non-functional; very poorly designed.  Also used
   pejoratively of people.  See @{"dread high-bit disease" LINK "jarg_D" 967} for an
   example.  Approximate synonyms: @{"bletcherous" LINK "jarg_B" 993}, @{"bagbiting" LINK "jarg_B" 146}
   @{"losing" LINK "jarg_L" 568}, @{"brain-damaged" LINK "jarg_B" 1633}.

@{b}crippleware@{ub} n.  1. Software that has some important
   functionality deliberately removed, so as to entice potential users
   to pay for a working version.  2. [Cambridge] Variety of
   @{"guiltware" LINK "jarg_G" 823} that exhorts you to donate to some charity (compare
   @{"careware" LINK "jarg_C" 149}, @{"nagware" LINK "jarg_N" 35}).  3. Hardware deliberately crippled,
   which can be upgraded to a more expensive model by a trivial change
   (e.g., cutting a jumper).

   An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is Intel's 486SX
   chip, which is a standard 486DX chip with the co-processor dyked
   out (in some early versions it was present but disabled).  To
   upgrade, you buy a complete 486DX chip with *working*
   co-processor (its identity thinly veiled by a different pinout) and
   plug it into the board's expansion socket.  It then disables the
   SX, which becomes a fancy power sink.  Don't you love Intel?

@{b}critical mass@{ub} n.  In physics, the minimum amount of
   fissionable material required to sustain a chain reaction.  Of a
   software product, describes a condition of the software such that
   fixing one bug introduces one plus @{"epsilon" LINK "jarg_E" 371} bugs.  (This malady
   has many causes: @{"creeping featurism" LINK "jarg_C" 1402}, ports to too many
   disparate environments, poor initial design, etc.)  When software
   achieves critical mass, it can never be fixed; it can only be
   discarded and rewritten.

@{b}crlf@{ub} /ker'l*f/, sometimes /kru'l*f/ or /C-R-L-F/ n. 
   (often capitalized as `CRLF') A carriage return (CR, ASCII 0001101)
   followed by a line feed (LF, ASCII 0001010).  More loosely,
   whatever it takes to get you from the end of one line of text to
   the beginning of the next line.  See @{"newline" LINK "jarg_N" 385}, @{"terpri" LINK "jarg_T" 460}.
   Under @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54} influence this usage has become less common (Unix
   uses a bare line feed as its `CRLF').

@{b}crock@{ub} n.  [from the American scatologism `crock of shit']
   1. An awkward feature or programming technique that ought to be
   made cleaner.  For example, using small integers to represent error
   codes without the program interpreting them to the user (as in, for
   example, Unix `make(1)', which returns code 139 for a process
   that dies due to @{"segfault" LINK "jarg_S" 534}).  2. A technique that works
   acceptably, but which is quite prone to failure if disturbed in the
   least.  For example, a too-clever programmer might write an
   assembler which mapped instruction mnemonics to numeric opcodes
   algorithmically, a trick which depends far too intimately on the
   particular bit patterns of the opcodes.  (For another example of
   programming with a dependence on actual opcode values, see 
   @{"The Story of Mel, a Real Programmer" LINK "jarg_app" 460} in Appendix A.)  Many crocks
   have a tightly woven, almost completely unmodifiable structure.
   See @{"kluge" LINK "jarg_K" 155}, @{"brittle" LINK "jarg_B" 1721}.  The adjectives `crockish' and
   `crocky', and the nouns `crockishness' and `crockitude', are
   also used.

@{b}cross-post@{ub} [Usenet] vi.  To post a single article
   simultaneously to several newsgroups.  Distinguished from posting
   the article repeatedly, once to each newsgroup, which causes people
   to see it multiple times (which is very bad form).  Gratuitous
   cross-posting without a Followup-To line directing responses to a
   single followup group is frowned upon, as it tends to cause
   @{"followup" LINK "jarg_F" 806} articles to go to inappropriate newsgroups when
   people respond to only one part of the original posting.

@{b}crudware@{ub} /kruhd'weir/ n.  Pejorative term for the hundreds
   of megabytes of low-quality @{"freeware" LINK "jarg_F" 1121} circulated by user's
   groups and BBS systems in the micro-hobbyist world.  "Yet
   *another* set of disk catalog utilities for @{"MS-DOS" LINK "jarg_M" 1016}?
   What crudware!"

@{b}cruft@{ub} /kruhft/  [back-formation from @{"crufty" LINK "jarg_C" 1537}] 1. n. An
   unpleasant substance.  The dust that gathers under your bed is
   cruft; the TMRC Dictionary correctly noted that attacking it with a
   broom only produces more.  2. n. The results of shoddy
   construction.  3. vt. [from `hand cruft', pun on `hand craft']
   To write assembler code for something normally (and better) done by
   a compiler (see @{"hand-hacking" LINK "jarg_H" 366}).  4. n. Excess; superfluous
   junk; used esp. of redundant or superseded code.  5. [University
   of Wisconsin] n. Cruft is to hackers as gaggle is to geese; that
   is, at UW one properly says "a cruft of hackers".

   This term is one of the oldest in the jargon and no one is sure of
   its etymology, but it is suggestive that there is a Cruft Hall at
   Harvard University which is part of the old physics building; it's
   said to have been the physics department's radar lab during WWII.
   To this day (early 1993) the windows appear to be full of random
   techno-junk.  MIT or Lincoln Labs people may well have coined the
   term as a knock on the competition.

@{b}cruft together@{ub} vt.  (also `cruft up') To throw together
   something ugly but temporarily workable.  Like vt. @{"kluge up" LINK "jarg_K" 237},
   but more pejorative.  "There isn't any program now to reverse all
   the lines of a file, but I can probably cruft one together in about
   10 minutes."  See @{"hack together" LINK "jarg_H" 93}, @{"hack up" LINK "jarg_H" 97}, @{"kluge up" LINK "jarg_K" 237},
   @{"crufty" LINK "jarg_C" 1537}.

@{b}cruftsmanship@{ub} /kruhfts'm*n-ship / n.  [from @{"cruft" LINK "jarg_C" 1508}]
   The antithesis of craftsmanship.

@{b}crufty@{ub} /kruhf'tee/ adj.  [origin unknown; poss. from
   `crusty' or `cruddy'] 1. Poorly built, possibly over-complex.
   The @{"canonical" LINK "jarg_C" 89} example is "This is standard old crufty
   @{"DEC" LINK "jarg_D" 246} software".  In fact, one fanciful theory of the origin of
   `crufty' holds that was originally a mutation of `crusty'
   applied to DEC software so old that the `s' characters were tall
   and skinny, looking more like `f' characters.  2. Unpleasant,
   especially to the touch, often with encrusted junk.  Like spilled
   coffee smeared with peanut butter and catsup.  3. Generally
   unpleasant.  4. (sometimes spelled `cruftie') n. A small crufty
   object (see @{"frob" LINK "jarg_F" 1170}); often one that doesn't fit well into the
   scheme of things.  "A LISP property list is a good place to store
   crufties (or, collectively, @{"random" LINK "jarg_R" 26} cruft)."

@{b}crumb@{ub} n.  Two binary digits; a @{"quad" LINK "jarg_Q" 1}.  Larger than a
   @{"bit" LINK "jarg_B" 729}, smaller than a @{"nybble" LINK "jarg_N" 681}.  Considered silly.
   Syn. @{"tayste" LINK "jarg_T" 266}.  General discussion of such terms is under
   @{"nybble" LINK "jarg_N" 681}.

@{b}crunch@{ub} 1. vi.  To process, usually in a time-consuming or
   complicated way.  Connotes an essentially trivial operation that is
   nonetheless painful to perform.  The pain may be due to the
   triviality's being embedded in a loop from 1 to 1,000,000,000.
   "FORTRAN programs do mostly @{"number-crunching" LINK "jarg_N" 655}."  2. vt. To
   reduce the size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces bit
   configurations completely unrelated to the original data, such as
   by a Huffman code.  (The file ends up looking something like a
   paper document would if somebody crunched the paper into a wad.)
   Since such compression usually takes more computations than simpler
   methods such as run-length encoding, the term is doubly
   appropriate.  (This meaning is usually used in the construction
   `file crunch(ing)' to distinguish it from @{"number-crunching" LINK "jarg_N" 655}.)
   See @{"compress" LINK "jarg_C" 822}.  3. n. The character `#'.  Used at XEROX
   and CMU, among other places.  See @{"ASCII" LINK "jarg_A" 413}.  4. vt. To squeeze
   program source into a minimum-size representation that will still
   compile or execute.  The term came into being specifically for a
   famous program on the BBC micro that crunched BASIC source in order
   to make it run more quickly (it was a wholly interpretive BASIC, so
   the number of characters mattered).  @{"Obfuscated C Contest" LINK "jarg_O" 10}
   entries are often crunched; see the first example under that entry.

@{b}cruncha cruncha cruncha@{ub} /kruhn'ch* kruhn'ch* kruhn'ch*/ interj. 
   An encouragement sometimes muttered to a machine
   bogged down in a serious @{"grovel" LINK "jarg_G" 803}.  Also describes a notional
   sound made by groveling hardware.  See @{"wugga wugga" LINK "jarg_W" 755}, @{"grind" LINK "jarg_G" 718}
   (sense 3).

@{b}cryppie@{ub} /krip'ee/ n.  A cryptographer.  One who hacks or
   implements cryptographic software or hardware.

@{b}CTSS@{ub} /C-T-S-S/ n.  Compatible Time-Sharing System.  An
   early (1963) experiment in the design of interactive time-sharing
   operating systems, ancestral to @{"Multics" LINK "jarg_M" 1145}, @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54}, and
   @{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463}.  The name @{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463} (Incompatible Time-sharing System)
   was a hack on CTSS, meant both as a joke and to express some basic
   differences in philosophy about the way I/O services should be
   presented to user programs.

@{b}CTY@{ub} /sit'ee/ or /C-T-Y/ n.  [MIT] The terminal
   physically associated with a computer's system @{"console" LINK "jarg_C" 975}.  The
   term is a contraction of `Console @{"tty" LINK "jarg_T" 1101}', that is, `Console
   TeleTYpe'.  This @{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463}- and @{"TOPS-10" LINK "jarg_T" 881}-associated term has
   become less common, as most Unix hackers simply refer to the CTY as
   `the console'.

@{b}cube@{ub} n.  1. [short for `cubicle'] A module in the
   open-plan offices used at many programming shops.  "I've got the
   manuals in my cube."  2. A NeXT machine (which resembles a
   matte-black cube).

@{b}cubing@{ub} vi.  [parallel with `tubing'] 1. Hacking on an IPSC
   (Intel Personal SuperComputer) hypercube.  "Louella's gone cubing
   *again*!!"  2. Hacking Rubik's Cube or related puzzles,
   either physically or mathematically.  3. An indescribable form of
   self-torture (see sense 1 or 2).

@{b}cursor dipped in X@{ub} n.  There are a couple of metaphors in
   English of the form `pen dipped in X' (perhaps the most common
   values of X are `acid', `bile', and `vitriol').  These map
   over neatly to this hackish usage (the cursor being what moves,
   leaving letters behind, when one is composing on-line).  "Talk
   about a @{"nastygram" LINK "jarg_N" 132}!  He must've had his cursor dipped in acid
   when he wrote that one!"

@{b}cuspy@{ub} /kuhs'pee/ adj.  [WPI: from the @{"DEC" LINK "jarg_D" 246}
   abbreviation CUSP, for `Commonly Used System Program', i.e., a
   utility program used by many people] 1. (of a program)
   Well-written.  2. Functionally excellent.  A program that performs
   well and interfaces well to users is cuspy.  See @{"rude" LINK "jarg_R" 700}.
   3. [NYU] Said of an attractive woman, especially one regarded as
   available.  Implies a certain curvaceousness.

@{b}cut a tape@{ub} vi.  To write a software or document distribution
   on magnetic tape for shipment.  Has nothing to do with physically
   cutting the medium!  Early versions of this lexicon claimed that
   one never analogously speaks of `cutting a disk', but this has
   since been reported as live usage.  Related slang usages are
   mainstream business's `cut a check', the recording industry's
   `cut a record', and the military's `cut an order'.

   All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete
   recording and duplication technologies.  The first stage in
   manufacturing an old-style vinyl record involved cutting grooves in
   a stamping die with a precision lathe.  More mundanely, the
   dominant technology for mass duplication of paper documents in
   pre-photocopying days involved "cutting a stencil", punching away
   portions of the wax overlay on a silk screen.  More directly,
   paper tape with holes punched in it was an important early storage
   medium.

@{b}cybercrud@{ub} /si:'ber-kruhd/ n.  1. [coined by Ted Nelson]
   Obfuscatory tech-talk.  Verbiage with a high @{"MEGO" LINK "jarg_M" 399} factor.  The
   computer equivalent of bureaucratese.  2. Incomprehensible stuff
   embedded in email.  First there were the "Received" headers that
   show how mail flows through systems, then MIME (Multi-purpose
   Internet Mail Extensions) headers and part boundaries, and now huge
   blocks of hex for PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) or PGP (Pretty Good
   Privacy) digital signatures and certificates of authenticity.  This
   stuff all services a purpose and good user interfaces should hide
   it, but all too often users are forced to wade through it.

@{b}cyberpunk@{ub} /si:'ber-puhnk/ n.,adj.  [orig. by SF writer
   Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A subgenre of SF
   launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel
   "Neuromancer" (though its roots go back through Vernor Vinge's
   "True Names" (see the @{"Bibliography" LINK "jarg_app" 1109} in Appendix C) to
   John Brunner's 1975 novel "The Shockwave Rider").  Gibson's
   near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker
   culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and
   hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both
   irritatingly na"ive and tremendously stimulating.  Gibson's work
   was widely imitated, in particular by the short-lived but
   innovative "Max Headroom" TV series.  See @{"cyberspace" LINK "jarg_C" 1684},
   @{"ice" LINK "jarg_I" 59}, @{"jack in" LINK "jarg_J" 19}, @{"go flatline" LINK "jarg_G" 405}.

   Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or
   fashion trend that calls itself `cyberpunk', associated especially
   with the rave/techno subculture.  Hackers have mixed feelings about
   this.  On the one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to
   be shallow trendoids in black leather who have substituted
   enthusiastic blathering about technology for actually learning and
   *doing* it.  Attitude is no substitute for competence.  On the
   other hand, at least cyberpunks are excited about the right things
   and properly respectful of hacking talent in those who have it.
   The general consensus is to tolerate them politely in hopes that
   they'll attract people who grow into being true hackers.

@{b}cyberspace@{ub} /si:'ber-spays`/ n.  1. Notional
   `information-space' loaded with visual cues and navigable with
   brain-computer interfaces called `cyberspace decks'; a
   characteristic prop of @{"cyberpunk" LINK "jarg_C" 1658} SF.  Serious efforts to
   construct @{"virtual reality" LINK "jarg_V" 300} interfaces modeled explicitly on
   Gibsonian cyberspace are under way, using more conventional devices
   such as glove sensors and binocular TV headsets.  Few hackers are
   prepared to deny outright the possibility of a cyberspace someday
   evolving out of the network (see @{"network, the" LINK "jarg_N" 330}).  2. The
   Internet or @{"Matrix" LINK "jarg_M" 362} (sense #2) as a whole, considered as a
   crude cyberspace.  As of 1996, hackers only rarely use the term
   this way because the Internet does not meet the high, SF-inspired
   standards they have for true cyberspace technology.  Thus, this use
   of the term usually tags a @{"wannabee" LINK "jarg_W" 150} or outsider.
   3. Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the mind of a person in
   @{"hack mode" LINK "jarg_H" 61}.  Some hackers report experiencing strong eidetic
   imagery when in hack mode; interestingly, independent reports from
   multiple sources suggest that there are common features to the
   experience.  In particular, the dominant colors of this subjective
   `cyberspace' are often gray and silver, and the imagery often
   involves constellations of marching dots, elaborate shifting
   patterns of lines and angles, or moire patterns.

@{b}cycle@{ub}  1. n. The basic unit of computation.  What every
   hacker wants more of (noted hacker Bill Gosper describes himself as
   a "cycle junkie"). One can describe an instruction as taking so
   many `clock cycles'.  Often the computer can access its memory
   once on every clock cycle, and so one speaks also of `memory
   cycles'.  These are technical meanings of @{"cycle" LINK "jarg_C" 1707}.  The jargon
   meaning comes from the observation that there are only so many
   cycles per second, and when you are sharing a computer the cycles
   get divided up among the users.  The more cycles the computer
   spends working on your program rather than someone else's, the
   faster your program will run.  That's why every hacker wants more
   cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to
   respond.  2. By extension, a notional unit of *human* thought
   power, emphasizing that lots of things compete for the typical
   hacker's think time.  "I refused to get involved with the Rubik's
   Cube back when it was big.  Knew I'd burn too many cycles on it if
   I let myself."  3. vt. Syn. @{"bounce" LINK "jarg_B" 1532} (sense 4), @{"120 reset" LINK "jarg_alph" 92};
   from the phrase `cycle power'. "Cycle the machine again, that
   serial port's still hung."

@{b}cycle crunch@{ub} n.  A situation wherein the number of people
   trying to use a computer simultaneously has reached the point where
   no one can get enough cycles because they are spread too thin and
   the system has probably begun to @{"thrash" LINK "jarg_T" 573}.  This scenario is an
   inevitable result of Parkinson's Law applied to timesharing.
   Usually the only solution is to buy more computer.  Happily, this
   has rapidly become easier since the mid-1980s, so much so that the
   very term `cycle crunch' now has a faintly archaic flavor; most
   hackers now use workstations or personal computers as opposed to
   traditional timesharing systems.

@{b}cycle drought@{ub} n.  A scarcity of cycles.  It may be due to a
   @{"cycle crunch" LINK "jarg_C" 1727}, but it could also occur because part of the
   computer is temporarily not working, leaving fewer cycles to go
   around.  "The @{"high moby" LINK "jarg_H" 680} is @{"down" LINK "jarg_D" 890}, so we're running with
   only half the usual amount of memory.  There will be a cycle
   drought until it's fixed."

@{b}cycle of reincarnation@{ub} n.  [coined in a paper by T. H. Myer
   and I.E. Sutherland "On the Design of Display Processors", Comm.
   ACM, Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used to refer to a well-known
   effect whereby function in a computing system family is migrated
   out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed, then the
   peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its job,
   then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two
   asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function
   back into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again.

   Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in
   graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in
   communications and floating-point processors.  Also known as `the
   Wheel of Life', `the Wheel of Samsara', and other variations of
   the basic Hindu/Buddhist theological idea.  See also @{"blitter" LINK "jarg_B" 1074},
   @{"bit bang" LINK "jarg_B" 758}.

@{b}cycle server@{ub} n.  A powerful machine that exists primarily
   for running large @{"batch" LINK "jarg_B" 361} jobs.  Implies that interactive tasks
   such as editing are done on other machines on the network, such as
   workstations.

@{b}cypherpunk@{ub} n.  [from @{"cyberpunk" LINK "jarg_C" 1658}] Someone interested in the
   uses of encryption via electronic ciphers for enhancing personal
   privacy and guarding against tyranny by centralized, authoritarian
   power structures, especially government.  There is an active
   cypherpunks mailing list at cypherpunks-request@toad.com
   coordinating work on public-key encryption freeware, privacy, and
   digital cash.  See also @{"tentacle" LINK "jarg_T" 408}.

@endnode
@node jarg_D "D"
@{b}D. C. Power Lab@{ub} n.  The former site of @{"SAIL" LINK "jarg_S" 183}.  Hackers
   thought this was very funny because the obvious connection to
   electrical engineering was nonexistent -- the lab was named for a
   Donald C.  Power.  Compare @{"Marginal Hacks" LINK "jarg_M" 292}.

@{b}daemon@{ub} /day'mn/ or /dee'mn/ n.  [from the mythological
   meaning, later rationalized as the acronym `Disk And Execution
   MONitor'] A program that is not invoked explicitly, but lies
   dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur.  The idea is that
   the perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is
   lurking (though often a program will commit an action only because
   it knows that it will implicitly invoke a daemon).  For example,
   under @{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463} writing a file on the @{"LPT" LINK "jarg_L" 620} spooler's directory
   would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file.
   The advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files
   printed need neither compete for access to nor understand any
   idiosyncrasies of the @{"LPT" LINK "jarg_L" 620}.  They simply enter their implicit
   requests and let the daemon decide what to do with them.  Daemons
   are usually spawned automatically by the system, and may either
   live forever or be regenerated at intervals.

   Daemon and @{"demon" LINK "jarg_D" 422} are often used interchangeably, but seem to
   have distinct connotations.  The term `daemon' was introduced to
   computing by @{"CTSS" LINK "jarg_C" 1587} people (who pronounced it /dee'mon/) and
   used it to refer to what ITS called a @{"dragon" LINK "jarg_D" 933}.  Although the
   meaning and the pronunciation have drifted, we think this glossary
   reflects current (1996) usage.

@{b}daemon book@{ub} n.  "The Design and Implementation of the
   4.3BSD UNIX Operating System", by Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk
   McKusick, Michael J. Karels, and John S. Quarterman (Addison-Wesley
   Publishers, 1989, ISBN 0-201-06196-1) -- the standard reference
   book on the internals of @{"BSD" LINK "jarg_B" 1854} Unix.  So called because the
   cover has a picture depicting a little devil (a visual play on
   @{"daemon" LINK "jarg_D" 6}) in sneakers, holding a pitchfork (referring to one of
   the characteristic features of Unix, the `fork(2)' system
   call).  Also known as the @{"Devil Book" LINK "jarg_D" 489}.

@{b}dahmum@{ub} /dah'mum/ n.  [Usenet] The material of which
   protracted @{"flame war" LINK "jarg_F" 633}s, especially those about operating
   systems, are comprised. Homeomorphic to @{"spam" LINK "jarg_S" 1403}.  The term
   `dahmum' is derived from the name of a militant @{"OS/2" LINK "jarg_O" 308}
   advocate, and originated when an extensively crossposted
   OS/2-versus-@{"Linux" LINK "jarg_L" 329} debate was fed through @{"Dissociated Press" LINK "jarg_D" 648}.

@{b}dangling pointer@{ub} n.  A reference that doesn't actually lead
   anywhere (in C and some other languages, a pointer that doesn't
   actually point at anything valid).  Usually this happens because it
   formerly pointed to something that has moved or disappeared.  Used
   as jargon in a generalization of its techspeak meaning; for
   example, a local phone number for a person who has since moved to
   the other coast is a dangling pointer.  Compare @{"dead link" LINK "jarg_D" 170}.

@{b}dark-side hacker@{ub} n.  A criminal or malicious hacker; a
   @{"cracker" LINK "jarg_C" 1253}.  From George Lucas's Darth Vader, "seduced by the
   dark side of the Force".  The implication that hackers form a sort
   of elite of technological Jedi Knights is intended.  Oppose
   @{"samurai" LINK "jarg_S" 249}.

@{b}Datamation@{ub} /day`t*-may'sh*n/ n.  A magazine that many
   hackers assume all @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}s read.  Used to question an unbelieved
   quote, as in "Did you read that in "Datamation?"" (But see
   below; this slur may be dated by the time you read this.) It used
   to publish something hackishly funny every once in a while, like
   the original paper on @{"COME FROM" LINK "jarg_C" 705} in 1973, and Ed Post's
   "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" ten years later, but for
   a long time after that it was much more exclusively
   @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}-oriented and boring.  Following a change of editorship in
   1994, Datamation is trying for more of the technical content and
   irreverent humor that marked its early days.

@{b}DAU@{ub} /dow/ [German FidoNet] n.  German acronym for
   D"ummster Anzunehmender User (stupidest imaginable user).
   From the engineering-slang GAU for Gr"osster Anzunehmender
   Unfall, worst foreseeable accident, esp. of a LNG tank farm plant
   or something with similarly disastrous consequences.  In popular
   German, GAU is used only to refer to worst-case nuclear acidents
   such as a core meltdown. See @{"cretin" LINK "jarg_C" 1429}, @{"fool" LINK "jarg_F" 903}, @{"loser" LINK "jarg_L" 561} and
   @{"weasel" LINK "jarg_W" 291}.

@{b}day mode@{ub} n.  See @{"phase" LINK "jarg_P" 406} (sense 1).  Used of people only.

@{b}dd@{ub} /dee-dee/ vt.  [Unix: from IBM @{"JCL" LINK "jarg_J" 32}] Equivalent to
   @{"cat" LINK "jarg_C" 227} or @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155}.  Originally the name of a Unix copy command
   with special options suitable for block-oriented devices; it was
   often used in heavy-handed system maintenance, as in "Let's
   `dd' the root partition onto a tape, then use the boot PROM to
   load it back on to a new disk".  The Unix `dd(1)' was
   designed with a weird, distinctly non-Unixy keyword option syntax
   reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL (which had an elaborate DD
   `Dataset Definition' specification for I/O devices); though the
   command filled a need, the interface design was clearly a prank.
   The jargon usage is now very rare outside Unix sites and now nearly
   obsolete even there, as `dd(1)' has been @{"deprecated" LINK "jarg_D" 456} for a
   long time (though it has no exact replacement).  The term has been
   displaced by @{"BLT" LINK "jarg_B" 1155} or simple English `copy'.

@{b}DDT@{ub} /D-D-T/ n.  1. Generic term for a program that assists
   in debugging other programs by showing individual machine
   instructions in a readable symbolic form and letting the user
   change them.  In this sense the term DDT is now archaic, having
   been widely displaced by `debugger' or names of individual
   programs like `adb', `sdb', `dbx', or `gdb'.
   2. [ITS] Under MIT's fabled @{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463} operating system, DDT (running
   under the alias HACTRN) was also used as the @{"shell" LINK "jarg_S" 666} or top
   level command language used to execute other programs.  3. Any one
   of several specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early @{"DEC" LINK "jarg_D" 246}
   hardware.  The DEC PDP-10 Reference Handbook (1969) contained a
   footnote on the first page of the documentation for DDT that
   illuminates the origin of the term:

     Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1
     computer in 1961.  At that time DDT stood for "DEC Debugging
     Tape".  Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has
     propagated throughout the computer industry.  DDT programs are
     now available for all DEC computers.  Since media other than tape
     are now frequently used, the more descriptive name "Dynamic
     Debugging Technique" has been adopted, retaining the DDT
     abbreviation.  Confusion between DDT-10 and another well known
     pesticide, dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (C14-H9-Cl5) should
     be minimal since each attacks a different, and apparently
     mutually exclusive, class of bugs.

   (The `tape' referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic but paper.)
   Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the
   handbook after the @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}s took over and DEC became much more
   `businesslike'.

   The history above is known to many old-time hackers.  But there's
   more: Peter Samson, compiler of the original @{"TMRC" LINK "jarg_T" 766} lexicon,
   reports that he named `DDT' after a similar tool on the TX-0
   computer, the direct ancestor of the PDP-1 built at MIT's Lincoln
   Lab in 1957.  The debugger on that ground-breaking machine (the
   first transistorized computer) rejoiced in the name FLIT
   (FLexowriter Interrogation Tape).

@{b}de-rezz@{ub} /dee-rez'/  [from `de-resolve' via the movie
   "Tron"] (also `derez') 1. vi. To disappear or dissolve; the
   image that goes with it is of an object breaking up into raster
   lines and static and then dissolving.  Occasionally used of a
   person who seems to have suddenly `fuzzed out' mentally rather than
   physically.  Usage: extremely silly, also rare.  This verb was
   actually invented as *fictional* hacker jargon, and adopted in
   a spirit of irony by real hackers years after the fact.  2. vt. The
   Macintosh resource decompiler.  On a Macintosh, many program
   structures (including the code itself) are managed in small
   segments of the program file known as `resources'; `Rez' and
   `DeRez' are a pair of utilities for compiling and decompiling
   resource files.  Thus, decompiling a resource is `derezzing'.
   Usage: very common.

@{b}dead@{ub} adj.  1. Non-functional; @{"down" LINK "jarg_D" 890}; @{"crash" LINK "jarg_C" 1306}ed.
   Especially used of hardware.  2. At XEROX PARC, software that is
   working but not undergoing continued development and support.
   3. Useless; inaccessible.  Antonym: `live'.  Compare @{"dead code" LINK "jarg_D" 157}.

@{b}dead code@{ub} n.  Routines that can never be accessed because
   all calls to them have been removed, or code that cannot be reached
   because it is guarded by a control structure that provably must
   always transfer control somewhere else.  The presence of dead code
   may reveal either logical errors due to alterations in the program
   or significant changes in the assumptions and environment of the
   program (see also @{"software rot" LINK "jarg_S" 1246}); a good compiler should report
   dead code so a maintainer can think about what it means.
   (Sometimes it simply means that an *extremely* defensive
   programmer has inserted @{"can't happen" LINK "jarg_C" 50} tests which really can't
   happen -- yet.)  Syn. @{"grunge" LINK "jarg_G" 813}.  See also @{"dead" LINK "jarg_D" 152}, and
   @{"The Story of Mel, a Real Programmer" LINK "jarg_app" 460}.

@{b}dead link@{ub} n.  [WWW] A World-Wide-Web URL that no longer
   points to the information it was written to reach.  Usually this
   happens because the document has been moved or deleted.  Lots of
   dead links make a WWW page frustrating and useless and are the #1
   sign of poor page maintainance. Compare @{"dangling pointer" LINK "jarg_D" 46}.

@{b}DEADBEEF@{ub} /ded-beef/ n.  The hexadecimal word-fill pattern
   for freshly allocated memory (decimal -21524111) under a number of
   IBM environments, including the RS/6000.  Some modern debugging
   tools deliberately fill freed memory with this value as a way of
   converting @{"heisenbug" LINK "jarg_H" 579}s into @{"Bohr bug" LINK "jarg_B" 1417}s.  As in "Your
   program is DEADBEEF" (meaning gone, aborted, flushed from memory);
   if you start from an odd half-word boundary, of course, you have
   BEEFDEAD.  See also the anecdote under @{"fool" LINK "jarg_F" 903}.

@{b}deadlock@{ub} n.  1. [techspeak] A situation wherein two or more
   processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for one of
   the others to do something.  A common example is a program
   communicating to a server, which may find itself waiting for output
   from the server before sending anything more to it, while the
   server is similarly waiting for more input from the controlling
   program before outputting anything.  (It is reported that this
   particular flavor of deadlock is sometimes called a `starvation
   deadlock', though the term `starvation' is more properly used for
   situations where a program can never run simply because it never
   gets high enough priority.  Another common flavor is
   `constipation', in which each process is trying to send stuff to
   the other but all buffers are full because nobody is reading
   anything.)  See @{"deadly embrace" LINK "jarg_D" 205}.  2. Also used of deadlock-like
   interactions between humans, as when two people meet in a narrow
   corridor, and each tries to be polite by moving aside to let the
   other pass, but they end up swaying from side to side without
   making any progress because they always move the same way at the
   same time.

@{b}deadly embrace@{ub} n.  Same as @{"deadlock" LINK "jarg_D" 185}, though usually
   used only when exactly two processes are involved.  This is the
   more popular term in Europe, while @{"deadlock" LINK "jarg_D" 185} predominates in
   the United States.

@{b}death code@{ub} n.  A routine whose job is to set everything in
   the computer -- registers, memory, flags, everything -- to zero,
   including that portion of memory where it is running; its last act
   is to stomp on its own "store zero" instruction.  Death code
   isn't very useful, but writing it is an interesting hacking
   challenge on architectures where the instruction set makes it
   possible, such as the PDP-8 (it has also been done on the DG Nova).

   Perhaps the ultimate death code is on the TI 990 series, where all
   registers are actually in RAM, and the instruction "store
   immediate 0" has the opcode "0". The PC will immediately wrap
   around core as many times as it can until a user hits HALT.  Any
   empty memory location is death code.  Worse, the manufacturer
   recommended use of this instruction in startup code (which would be
   in ROM and therefore survive).

@{b}Death Square@{ub} n.  The corporate logo of Novell, the people
   who acquired USL after AT&T let go of it (Novell eventually sold
the
   Unix group to SCO).  Coined by analogy with @{"Death Star" LINK "jarg_D" 233},
   because many people believed Novell was bungling the lead in
   Unix systems exactly as AT&T did for many years.

@{b}Death Star@{ub} n.  [from the movie "Star Wars"] 1. The
   AT&T corporate logo, which appears on computers sold by AT&T and
   bears an uncanny resemblance to the Death Star in the movie.  This
   usage is particularly common among partisans of @{"BSD" LINK "jarg_B" 1854} Unix, who
   tend to regard the AT&T versions as inferior and AT&T as a bad guy.
   Copies still circulate of a poster printed by Mt. Xinu showing a
   starscape with a space fighter labeled 4.2 BSD streaking away from
   a broken AT&T logo wreathed in flames.  2. AT&T's internal
   magazine, "Focus", uses `death star' to describe an
   incorrectly done AT&T logo in which the inner circle in the top
   left is dark instead of light -- a frequent result of
   dark-on-light logo images.

@{b}@{u}DEC@{uu}@{ub} n.  Commonly used abbreviation for Digital Equipment
   Corporation, now deprecated by DEC itself in favor of "Digital".
   Before the @{"killer micro" LINK "jarg_K" 81} revolution of the late 1980s,
   hackerdom was closely symbiotic with DEC's pioneering timesharing
   machines.  The first of the group of cultures described by this
   lexicon nucleated around the PDP-1 (see @{"TMRC" LINK "jarg_T" 766}.  Subsequently,
   the PDP-6, @{"PDP-10" LINK "jarg_P" 264}, @{"PDP-20" LINK "jarg_P" 285}, PDP-11 and @{"VAX" LINK "jarg_V" 60} were all
   foci of large and important hackerdoms, and DEC machines long
   dominated the ARPANET and Internet machine population.  DEC was the
   technological leader of the minicomputer era (roughly 1967 to
   1987), but its failure to embrace microcomputers and Unix early
   cost it heavily in profits and prestige after @{"silicon" LINK "jarg_S" 803} got
   cheap.  The microprocessor design tradition owes a heavy debt to
   the PDP-11 instruction set, and every one one of the major
   general-purpose microcomputer OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2,
   Windows NT) were either genetically descended from a DEC OS, or
   incubated on DEC hardware, or both.  Accordingly, DEC is still
   regarded with a certain wry affection even among many hackers too
   young to have grown up on DEC machines.  The contrast with @{"IBM" LINK "jarg_I" 21}
   is instructive.

   [1996 update: DEC has gradually been reclaiming some of its old
   reputation among techies in the last five years.  The success of
   the Alpha, an innovatively-designed and very high-performance
   @{"killer micro" LINK "jarg_K" 81}, has helped a lot.  So has DEC's newfound
   receptiveness to Unix and open systems in general --ESR]

@{b}dec@{ub} /dek/ v.  Verbal (and only rarely written) shorthand
   for decrement, i.e. `decrease by one'.  Especially used by
   assembly programmers, as many assembly languages have a `dec'
   mnemonic.  Antonym: @{"inc" LINK "jarg_I" 137}.

@{b}DEC Wars@{ub} n.  A 1983 @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190} posting by Alan Hastings and
   Steve Tarr spoofing the "Star Wars" movies in hackish terms.
   Some years later, ESR (disappointed by Hastings and Tarr's failure
   to exploit a great premise more thoroughly) posted a 3-times-longer
   complete rewrite called "Unix WARS"; the two are often
   confused.

@{b}decay@{ub} n.,vi  [from nuclear physics] An automatic conversion which
   is applied to most array-valued expressions in @{"C" LINK "jarg_C" 1}; they `decay
   into' pointer-valued expressions pointing to the array's first
   element.  This term is borderline techspeak, but is not used in the
   official standard for the language.

@{b}DEChead@{ub} /dek'hed/ n.  1. A @{"DEC" LINK "jarg_D" 246} @{"field servoid" LINK "jarg_F" 382}.
   Not flattering.  2. [from `deadhead'] A Grateful Dead fan working
   at DEC.

@{b}deckle@{ub} /dek'l/ n.  [from dec- and @{"nybble" LINK "jarg_N" 681}; the original
   spelling seems to have been `decle'] Two @{"nickle" LINK "jarg_N" 434}s; 10
   bits.  Reported among developers for Mattel's GI 1600 (the
   Intellivision games processor), a chip with 16-bit-wide RAM but
   10-bit-wide ROM.  See @{"nybble" LINK "jarg_N" 681} for other such terms.

@{b}DED@{ub} /D-E-D/ n.  Dark-Emitting Diode (that is, a burned-out
   LED).  Compare @{"SED" LINK "jarg_S" 530}, @{"LER" LINK "jarg_L" 160}, @{"write-only memory" LINK "jarg_W" 725}.  In the
   early 1970s both Signetics and Texas instruments released DED spec
   sheets as @{"AFJ" LINK "jarg_A" 135}s (suggested uses included "as a power-off
   indicator").

@{b}deep hack mode@{ub} n.  See @{"hack mode" LINK "jarg_H" 61}.

@{b}deep magic@{ub} n.  [poss. from C. S. Lewis's "Narnia"
   books] An awesomely arcane technique central to a program or
   system, esp. one neither generally published nor available to
   hackers at large (compare @{"black art" LINK "jarg_B" 938}); one that could only have
   been composed by a true @{"wizard" LINK "jarg_W" 588}.  Compiler optimization
   techniques and many aspects of @{"OS" LINK "jarg_O" 304} design used to be @{"deep magic" LINK "jarg_D" 309};
   many techniques in cryptography, signal processing,
   graphics, and AI still are.  Compare @{"heavy wizardry" LINK "jarg_H" 558}.  Esp.
   found in comments of the form "Deep magic begins here...".
   Compare @{"voodoo programming" LINK "jarg_V" 390}.

@{b}deep space@{ub} n.  1. Describes the notional location of any
   program that has gone @{"off the trolley" LINK "jarg_O" 91}.  Esp. used of
   programs that just sit there silently grinding long after either
   failure or some output is expected.  "Uh oh.  I should have gotten
   a prompt ten seconds ago.  The program's in deep space somewhere."
   Compare @{"buzz" LINK "jarg_B" 2126}, @{"catatonic" LINK "jarg_C" 249}, @{"hyperspace" LINK "jarg_H" 947}.  2. The
   metaphorical location of a human so dazed and/or confused or caught
   up in some esoteric form of @{"bogosity" LINK "jarg_B" 1365} that he or she no longer
   responds coherently to normal communication.  Compare @{"page out" LINK "jarg_P" 21}.

@{b}defenestration@{ub} n.  [from the traditional Czechoslovakian
   method of assassinating prime ministers, via SF fandom] 1. Proper
   karmic retribution for an incorrigible punster.  "Oh, ghod, that
   was *awful*!"  "Quick! Defenestrate him!"  2. The act of
   exiting a window system in order to get better response time from a
   full-screen program.  This comes from the dictionary meaning of
   `defenestrate', which is to throw something out a window.  3. The
   act of discarding something under the assumption that it will
   improve matters.  "I don't have any disk space left."  "Well,
   why don't you defenestrate that 100 megs worth of old core dumps?"
   4. Under a GUI, the act of dragging something out of a window
   (onto the screen). "Next, defenestrate the MugWump icon."
   5. [proposed] The requirement to support a command-line interface.
   "It has to run on a VT100."  "Curses!  I've been
   defenestrated!"

@{b}defined as@{ub} adj.  In the role of, usually in an
   organization-chart sense.  "Pete is currently defined as bug
   prioritizer."  Compare @{"logical" LINK "jarg_L" 496}.

@{b}dehose@{ub} /dee-hohz/ vt.  To clear a @{"hosed" LINK "jarg_H" 814} condition.

@{b}delint@{ub} /dee-lint/ v.,obs.  To modify code to remove
   problems detected when @{"lint" LINK "jarg_L" 318}ing.  Confusingly, this process is
   also referred to as `linting' code.  This term is no longer in
   general use because ANSI C compilers typically issue compile-time
   warnings as detailed as lint warnings.

@{b}delta@{ub} n.  1. [techspeak] A quantitative change, especially a
   small or incremental one (this use is general in physics and
   engineering).  "I just doubled the speed of my program!"  "What
   was the delta on program size?"  "About 30 percent."  (He
   doubled the speed of his program, but increased its size by only 30
   percent.)  2. [Unix] A @{"diff" LINK "jarg_D" 525}, especially a @{"diff" LINK "jarg_D" 525} stored
   under the set of version-control tools called SCCS (Source Code
   Control System) or RCS (Revision Control System).  3. n. A small
   quantity, but not as small as @{"epsilon" LINK "jarg_E" 371}.  The jargon usage of
   @{"delta" LINK "jarg_D" 358} and @{"epsilon" LINK "jarg_E" 371} stems from the traditional use of these
   letters in mathematics for very small numerical quantities,
   particularly in `epsilon-delta' proofs in limit theory (as in the
   differential calculus).  The term @{"delta" LINK "jarg_D" 358} is often used, once
   @{"epsilon" LINK "jarg_E" 371} has been mentioned, to mean a quantity that is
   slightly bigger than @{"epsilon" LINK "jarg_E" 371} but still very small.  "The cost
   isn't epsilon, but it's delta" means that the cost isn't totally
   negligible, but it is nevertheless very small.  Common
   constructions include `within delta of ---', `within epsilon of
   ---': that is, `close to' and `even closer to'.

@{b}demented@{ub} adj.  Yet another term of disgust used to describe
   a program.  The connotation in this case is that the program works
   as designed, but the design is bad.  Said, for example, of a
   program that generates large numbers of meaningless error messages,
   implying that it is on the brink of imminent collapse.  Compare
   @{"wonky" LINK "jarg_W" 639}, @{"bozotic" LINK "jarg_B" 1610}.

@{b}demigod@{ub} n.  A hacker with years of experience, a national
   reputation, and a major role in the development of at least one
   design, tool, or game used by or known to more than half of the
   hacker community.  To qualify as a genuine demigod, the person must
   recognizably identify with the hacker community and have helped
   shape it.  Major demigods include Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
   (co-inventors of @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54} and @{"C" LINK "jarg_C" 1}), Richard M. Stallman
   (inventor of @{"EMACS" LINK "jarg_E" 185}), and Linus Torvalds (inventor of Linux).
   In their hearts of hearts, most hackers dream of someday becoming
   demigods themselves, and more than one major software project has
   been driven to completion by the author's veiled hopes of
   apotheosis.  See also @{"net.god" LINK "jarg_N" 221}, @{"true-hacker" LINK "jarg_T" 1094}.

@{b}demo@{ub} /de'moh/  [short for `demonstration'] 1. v. To
   demonstrate a product or prototype.  A far more effective way of
   inducing bugs to manifest than any number of @{"test" LINK "jarg_T" 468} runs,
   especially when important people are watching.  2. n. The act of
   demoing.  "I've gotta give a demo of the drool-proof interface;
   how does it work again?"  3. n. Esp. as `demo version', can
   refer either to an early, barely-functional version of a program
   which can be used for demonstration purposes as long as the
   operator uses *exactly* the right commands and skirts its numerous
   bugs, deficiencies, and unimplemented portions, or to a special
   version of a program (frequently with some features crippled) which
   is distributed at little or no cost to the user for enticement
   purposes.

@{b}demo mode@{ub} n.  1. [Sun] The state of being @{"heads down" LINK "jarg_H" 531}
   in order to finish code in time for a @{"demo" LINK "jarg_D" 398}, usually due
   yesterday.  2. A mode in which video games sit by themselves
   running through a portion of the game, also known as `attract
   mode'.  Some serious @{"app" LINK "jarg_A" 340}s have a demo mode they use as a
   screen saver, or may go through a demo mode on startup (for
   example, the Microsoft Windows opening screen -- which lets you
   impress your neighbors without actually having to put up with
   @{"Microsloth Windows" LINK "jarg_M" 669}).

@{b}demon@{ub} n.  1. [MIT] A portion of a program that is not
   invoked explicitly, but that lies dormant waiting for some
   condition(s) to occur.  See @{"daemon" LINK "jarg_D" 6}.  The distinction is that
   demons are usually processes within a program, while daemons are
   usually programs running on an operating system.  2. [outside MIT]
   Often used equivalently to @{"daemon" LINK "jarg_D" 6} -- especially in the
   @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54} world, where the latter spelling and pronunciation is
   considered mildly archaic.

   Demons in sense 1 are particularly common in AI programs.  For
   example, a knowledge-manipulation program might implement inference
   rules as demons.  Whenever a new piece of knowledge was added,
   various demons would activate (which demons depends on the
   particular piece of data) and would create additional pieces of
   knowledge by applying their respective inference rules to the
   original piece.  These new pieces could in turn activate more
   demons as the inferences filtered down through chains of logic.
   Meanwhile, the main program could continue with whatever its
   primary task was.

@{b}demon dialer@{ub} n.  A program which repeatedly calls the same
   telephone number.  Demon dialing may be benign (as when a number of
   communications programs contend for legitimate access to a @{"BBS" LINK "jarg_B" 439}
   line) or malign (that is, used as a prank or denial-of-service
   attack).  This term dates from the @{"blue box" LINK "jarg_B" 1179} days of the 1970s
   and early 1980s and is now semi-obsolescent among @{"phreaker" LINK "jarg_P" 458}s;
   see @{"war dialer" LINK "jarg_W" 184} for its contemporary progeny.

@{b}depeditate@{ub} /dee-ped'*-tayt/ n.  [by (faulty) analogy with
   `decapitate'] Humorously, to cut off the feet of.  When one is
   using some computer-aided typesetting tools, careless placement of
   text blocks within a page or above a rule can result in chopped-off
   letter descenders.  Such letters are said to have been depeditated.

@{b}deprecated@{ub} adj.  Said of a program or feature that is
   considered obsolescent and in the process of being phased out,
   usually in favor of a specified replacement.  Deprecated features
   can, unfortunately, linger on for many years.  This term appears
   with distressing frequency in standards documents when the
   committees writing the documents realize that large amounts of
   extant (and presumably happily working) code depend on the
   feature(s) that have passed out of favor.  See also @{"dusty deck" LINK "jarg_D" 1175}.

@{b}derf@{ub} /derf/ v.,n.  [PLATO] The act of exploiting a
   terminal which someone else has absent-mindedly left logged on, to
   use that person's account, especially to post articles intended to
   make an ass of the victim you're impersonating.

@{b}deserves to lose@{ub} adj.  Said of someone who willfully does
   the @{"Wrong Thing" LINK "jarg_W" 745}; humorously, if one uses a feature known to be
   @{"marginal" LINK "jarg_M" 283}.  What is meant is that one deserves the consequences
   of one's @{"losing" LINK "jarg_L" 568} actions.  "Boy, anyone who tries to use
   @{"mess-dos" LINK "jarg_M" 476} deserves to @{"lose" LINK "jarg_L" 549}!" (@{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463} fans used to say
   the same thing of @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54}; many still do.)  See also @{"screw" LINK "jarg_S" 404},
   @{"chomp" LINK "jarg_C" 455}, @{"bagbiter" LINK "jarg_B" 130}.

@{b}desk check@{ub} n.,v.  To @{"grovel" LINK "jarg_G" 803} over hardcopy of source
   code, mentally simulating the control flow; a method of catching
   bugs.  No longer common practice in this age of on-screen editing,
   fast compiles, and sophisticated debuggers -- though some maintain
   stoutly that it ought to be.  Compare @{"eyeball search" LINK "jarg_E" 507},
   @{"vdiff" LINK "jarg_V" 194}, @{"vgrep" LINK "jarg_V" 244}.

@{b}despew@{ub} /d*-spyoo'/ v.  [Usenet] To automatically generate
   a large amount of garbage to the net, esp. from an automated
   posting program gone wild.  See @{"ARMM" LINK "jarg_A" 364}.

@{b}Devil Book@{ub} n.  See @{"daemon book" LINK "jarg_D" 29}, the term preferred by
   its authors.

@{b}devo@{ub} /dee'voh/ n.  [orig. in-house jargon at Symbolics] A
   person in a development group.  See also @{"doco" LINK "jarg_D" 711} and @{"mango" LINK "jarg_M" 261}.

@{b}dickless workstation@{ub} n.  Extremely pejorative hackerism for
   `diskless workstation', a class of botches including the Sun 3/50
   and other machines designed exclusively to network with an
   expensive central disk server.  These combine all the disadvantages
   of time-sharing with all the disadvantages of distributed personal
   computers; typically, they cannot even @{"boot" LINK "jarg_B" 1475} themselves without
   help (in the form of some kind of @{"breath-of-life packet" LINK "jarg_B" 1696}) from
   the server.

@{b}dictionary flame@{ub} n.  [Usenet] An attempt to sidetrack a
   debate away from issues by insisting on meanings for key terms that
   presuppose a desired conclusion or smuggle in an implicit premise.
   A common tactic of people who prefer argument over definitions to
   disputes about reality.  Compare @{"spelling flame" LINK "jarg_S" 1445}.

@{b}diddle@{ub}  1. vt. To work with or modify in a not particularly
   serious manner.  "I diddled a copy of @{"ADVENT" LINK "jarg_A" 111} so it didn't
   double-space all the time."  "Let's diddle this piece of code and
   see if the problem goes away."  See @{"tweak" LINK "jarg_T" 1177} and @{"twiddle" LINK "jarg_T" 1221}.
   2. n. The action or result of diddling.  See also @{"tweak" LINK "jarg_T" 1177},
   @{"twiddle" LINK "jarg_T" 1221}, @{"frob" LINK "jarg_F" 1170}.

@{b}die@{ub} v.  Syn. @{"crash" LINK "jarg_C" 1306}.  Unlike @{"crash" LINK "jarg_C" 1306}, which is used
   primarily of hardware, this verb is used of both hardware and
   software.  See also @{"go flatline" LINK "jarg_G" 405}, @{"casters-up mode" LINK "jarg_C" 198}.

@{b}die horribly@{ub} v.  The software equivalent of @{"crash and burn" LINK "jarg_C" 1322},
   and the preferred emphatic form of @{"die" LINK "jarg_D" 517}.  "The
   converter choked on an FF in its input and died horribly".

@{b}diff@{ub} /dif/ n.  1. A change listing, especially giving
   differences between (and additions to) source code or documents
   (the term is often used in the plural `diffs').  "Send me your
   diffs for the Jargon File!"  Compare @{"vdiff" LINK "jarg_V" 194}.  2. Specifically,
   such a listing produced by the `diff(1)' command, esp. when
   used as specification input to the `patch(1)' utility (which
   can actually perform the modifications; see @{"patch" LINK "jarg_P" 148}).  This is a
   common method of distributing patches and source updates in the
   Unix/C world.  3. v. To compare (whether or not by use of automated
   tools on machine-readable files); see also @{"vdiff" LINK "jarg_V" 194}, @{"mod" LINK "jarg_M" 836}.

@{b}digit@{ub} n.  An employee of Digital Equipment Corporation.  See
   also @{"VAX" LINK "jarg_V" 60}, @{"VMS" LINK "jarg_V" 362}, @{"PDP-10" LINK "jarg_P" 264}, @{"TOPS-10" LINK "jarg_T" 881}, @{"DEChead" LINK "jarg_D" 291},
   @{"double DECkers" LINK "jarg_D" 880}, @{"field circus" LINK "jarg_F" 356}.

@{b}dike@{ub} vt.  To remove or disable a portion of something, as a
   wire from a computer or a subroutine from a program.  A standard
   slogan is "When in doubt, dike it out".  (The implication is that
   it is usually more effective to attack software problems by
   reducing complexity than by increasing it.)  The word `dikes' is
   widely used among mechanics and engineers to mean `diagonal
   cutters', esp. the heavy-duty metal-cutting version, but may also
   refer to a kind of wire-cutters used by electronics techs.  To
   `dike something out' means to use such cutters to remove
   something.  Indeed, the TMRC Dictionary defined dike as "to attack
   with dikes".  Among hackers this term has been metaphorically
   extended to informational objects such as sections of code.

@{b}ding@{ub} n.,vi.  1. Synonym for @{"feep" LINK "jarg_F" 255}.  Usage: rare among
   hackers, but commoner in the @{"Real World" LINK "jarg_R" 267}.  2. `dinged': What
   happens when someone in authority gives you a minor bitching about
   something, esp. something trivial.  "I was dinged for having a
   messy desk."

@{b}dink@{ub} /dink/ adj.  Said of a machine that has the @{"bitty box" LINK "jarg_B" 924}
   nature; a machine too small to be worth bothering with ---
   sometimes the system you're currently forced to work on.  First
   heard from an MIT hacker working on a CP/M system with 64K, in
   reference to any 6502 system, then from fans of 32-bit
   architectures about 16-bit machines.  "GNUMACS will never work on
   that dink machine."  Probably derived from mainstream `dinky',
   which isn't sufficiently pejorative.  See @{"macdink" LINK "jarg_M" 4}.

@{b}dinosaur@{ub} n.  1. Any hardware requiring raised flooring and
   special power.  Used especially of old minis and mainframes, in
   contrast with newer microprocessor-based machines.  In a famous
   quote from the 1988 Unix EXPO, Bill Joy compared the liquid-cooled
   mainframe in the massive IBM display with a grazing dinosaur "with
   a truck outside pumping its bodily fluids through it".  IBM was
   not amused.  Compare @{"big iron" LINK "jarg_B" 591}; see also @{"mainframe" LINK "jarg_M" 210}.
   2. [IBM] A very conservative user; a @{"zipperhead" LINK "jarg_Z" 72}.

@{b}dinosaur pen@{ub} n.  A traditional @{"mainframe" LINK "jarg_M" 210} computer room
   complete with raised flooring, special power, its own
   ultra-heavy-duty air conditioning, and a side order of Halon fire
   extinguishers.  See @{"boa" LINK "jarg_B" 1269}.

@{b}dinosaurs mating@{ub} n.  Said to occur when yet another @{"big iron" LINK "jarg_B" 591}
   merger or buyout occurs; reflects a perception by hackers
   that these signal another stage in the long, slow dying of the
   @{"mainframe" LINK "jarg_M" 210} industry.  In its glory days of the 1960s, it was
   `IBM and the Seven Dwarves': Burroughs, Control Data, General
   Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and Univac.  RCA and GE sold out
   early, and it was `IBM and the Bunch' (Burroughs, Univac, NCR,
   Control Data, and Honeywell) for a while.  Honeywell was bought out
   by Bull; Burroughs merged with Univac to form Unisys (in 1984 ---
   this was when the phrase `dinosaurs mating' was coined); and in
   1991 AT&T absorbed NCR.  More such earth-shaking unions of doomed
   giants seem inevitable.

@{b}dirtball@{ub} n.  [XEROX PARC] A small, perhaps struggling
   outsider; not in the major or even the minor leagues.  For example,
   "Xerox is not a dirtball company".

   [Outsiders often observe in the PARC culture an institutional
   arrogance which usage of this term exemplifies.  The brilliance and
   scope of PARC's contributions to computer science have been such
   that this superior attitude is not much resented.  -- ESR]

@{b}dirty power@{ub} n.  Electrical mains voltage that is unfriendly
   to the delicate innards of computers.  Spikes, @{"drop-outs" LINK "jarg_D" 1041},
   average voltage significantly higher or lower than nominal, or just
   plain noise can all cause problems of varying subtlety and severity
   (these are collectively known as @{"power hit" LINK "jarg_P" 845}s).

@{b}disclaimer@{ub} n.  [Usenet] Statement ritually appended to many
   Usenet postings (sometimes automatically, by the posting software)
   reiterating the fact (which should be obvious, but is easily
   forgotten) that the article reflects its author's opinions and not
   necessarily those of the organization running the machine through
   which the article entered the network.

@{b}Discordianism@{ub} /dis-kor'di-*n-ism/ n.  The veneration of
   @{"Eris" LINK "jarg_E" 407}, a.k.a. Discordia; widely popular among hackers.
   Discordianism was popularized by Robert Shea and Robert Anton
   Wilson's novel "@{"Illuminatus!" LINK "jarg_app" 1128}" as a sort of
   self-subverting Dada-Zen for Westerners -- it should on no account
   be taken seriously but is far more serious than most jokes.
   Consider, for example, the Fifth Commandment of the Pentabarf, from
   "Principia Discordia": "A Discordian is Prohibited of
   Believing What he Reads."  Discordianism is usually connected with
   an elaborate conspiracy theory/joke involving millennia-long
   warfare between the anarcho-surrealist partisans of Eris and a
   malevolent, authoritarian secret society called the Illuminati.
   See @{"Religion" LINK "jarg_app" 908} in Appendix B, @{"Church of the SubGenius" LINK "jarg_C" 500}, and 
   @{"ha ha only serious" LINK "jarg_H" 14}.

@{b}disk farm@{ub} n.  (also @{"laundromat" LINK "jarg_L" 101}) A large room or rooms
   filled with disk drives (esp. @{"washing machine" LINK "jarg_W" 265}s).

@{b}display hack@{ub} n.  A program with the same approximate purpose
   as a kaleidoscope: to make pretty pictures.  Famous display hacks
   include @{"munching squares" LINK "jarg_M" 1212}, @{"smoking clover" LINK "jarg_S" 1007}, the BSD Unix
   `rain(6)' program, `worms(6)' on miscellaneous Unixes,
   and the @{"X" LINK "jarg_X" 1} `kaleid(1)' program.  Display hacks can also be
   implemented without programming by creating text files containing
   numerous escape sequences for interpretation by a video terminal;
   one notable example displayed, on any VT100, a Christmas tree with
   twinkling lights and a toy train circling its base.  The @{"hack value" LINK "jarg_H" 103}
   of a display hack is proportional to the esthetic value of
   the images times the cleverness of the algorithm divided by the
   size of the code.  Syn. @{"psychedelicware" LINK "jarg_P" 1051}.

@{b}Dissociated Press@{ub} n.  [play on `Associated Press'; perhaps
   inspired by a reference in the 1949 Bugs Bunny cartoon
   "What's Up, Doc?"] An algorithm for transforming any text
   into potentially humorous garbage even more efficiently than by
   passing it through a @{"marketroid" LINK "jarg_M" 299}.  The algorithm starts by
   printing any N consecutive words (or letters) in the text.
   Then at every step it searches for any random occurrence in the
   original text of the last N words (or letters) already
   printed and then prints the next word or letter.  @{"EMACS" LINK "jarg_E" 185} has a
   handy command for this.  Here is a short example of word-based
   Dissociated Press applied to an earlier version of this Jargon
   File:

     wart: n. A small, crocky @{"feature" LINK "jarg_F" 151} that sticks out of an array (C
     has no checks for this).  This is relatively benign and easy to
     spot if the phrase is bent so as to be not worth paying attention
     to the medium in question.

   Here is a short example of letter-based Dissociated Press applied
   to the same source:

     window sysIWYG: n. A bit was named aften /bee't*/ prefer to use
     the other guy's re, especially in every cast a chuckle on
     neithout getting into useful informash speech makes removing a
     featuring a move or usage actual abstractionsidered
     interj. Indeed spectace logic or problem!

   A hackish idle pastime is to apply letter-based Dissociated Press
   to a random body of text and @{"vgrep" LINK "jarg_V" 244} the output in hopes of finding
   an interesting new word.  (In the preceding example, `window
   sysIWYG' and `informash' show some promise.)  Iterated applications
   of Dissociated Press usually yield better results.  Similar
   techniques called `travesty generators' have been employed with
   considerable satirical effect to the utterances of Usenet flamers;
   see @{"pseudo" LINK "jarg_P" 1014}.

@{b}distribution@{ub} n.  1. A software source tree packaged for
   distribution; but see @{"kit" LINK "jarg_K" 122}.  2. A vague term encompassing
   mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups (but not @{"BBS" LINK "jarg_B" 439} @{"fora" LINK "jarg_F" 1021});
   any topic-oriented message channel with multiple recipients.  3. An
   information-space domain (usually loosely correlated with
   geography) to which propagation of a Usenet message is restricted;
   a much-underutilized feature.

@{b}disusered@{ub} adj.  [Usenet] Said of a person whose account on a
   computer has been removed, esp. for cause rather than through
   normal attrition.  "He got disusered when they found out he'd been
   cracking through the school's Internet access."  The verbal form
   `disuser' is live but less common.  Both usages probably derive
   from the DISUSER account status flag on VMS; setting it disables
   the account.  Compare @{"star out" LINK "jarg_S" 1609}.

@{b}do protocol@{ub} vi.  [from network protocol programming] To
   perform an interaction with somebody or something that follows a
   clearly defined procedure.  For example, "Let's do protocol with
   the check" at a restaurant means to ask for the check, calculate
   the tip and everybody's share, collect money from everybody,
   generate change as necessary, and pay the bill.  See @{"protocol" LINK "jarg_P" 984}.

@{b}doc@{ub} /dok/ n.  Common spoken and written shorthand for
   `documentation'.  Often used in the plural `docs' and in the
   construction `doc file' (i.e., documentation available on-line).

@{b}doco@{ub} /do'koh/ n.  [orig. in-house jargon at Symbolics] A
   documentation writer.  See also @{"devo" LINK "jarg_D" 492} and @{"mango" LINK "jarg_M" 261}.

@{b}@{u}documentation@{uu}@{ub} n.  The multiple kilograms of macerated,
   pounded, steamed, bleached, and pressed trees that accompany most
   modern software or hardware products (see also @{"tree-killer" LINK "jarg_T" 983}).
   Hackers seldom read paper documentation and (too) often resist
   writing it; they prefer theirs to be terse and on-line.  A common
   comment on this predilection is "You can't @{"grep" LINK "jarg_G" 704} dead trees".
   See @{"drool-proof paper" LINK "jarg_D" 1021}, @{"verbiage" LINK "jarg_V" 219}, @{"treeware" LINK "jarg_T" 992}.

@{b}dodgy@{ub} adj.  Syn. with @{"flaky" LINK "jarg_F" 586}.  Preferred outside the
   U.S.

@{b}dogcow@{ub} /dog'kow/ n.  See @{"Moof" LINK "jarg_M" 934}.  The dogcow is a
   semi-legendary creature that lurks in the depths of the Macintosh
   Technical Notes Hypercard stack V3.1.  The full story of the dogcow
   is told in technical note #31 (the particular Moof illustrated is
   properly named `Clarus').  Option-shift-click will cause it to emit
   a characteristic `Moof!' or `!fooM' sound.  *Getting* to tech
   note 31 is the hard part; to discover how to do that, one must
   needs examine the stack script with a hackerly eye.  Clue:
   @{"rot13" LINK "jarg_R" 594} is involved.  A dogcow also appears if you choose `Page
   Setup...' with a LaserWriter selected and click on the
   `Options' button.

@{b}dogpile@{ub} v.  [Usenet: prob. fr. mainstream "puppy pile"]
   When many people post unfriendly responses in short order to a
   single posting, they are sometimes said to "dogpile" or "dogpile
   on" the person to whom they're responding.  For example, when a
   religious missionary posts a simplistic appeal to alt.atheism,
   he can expect to be dogpiled.

@{b}dogwash@{ub} /dog'wosh/  [From a quip in the `urgency' field
   of a very optional software change request, ca. 1982.  It was
   something like "Urgency: Wash your dog first".] 1. n. A project
   of minimal priority, undertaken as an escape from more serious
   work.  2. v.  To engage in such a project.  Many games and much
   @{"freeware" LINK "jarg_F" 1121} get written this way.

@{b}domainist@{ub} /doh-mayn'ist/ adj.,obs.  1. Said of an
   @{"Internet address" LINK "jarg_I" 348} (as opposed to a @{"bang path" LINK "jarg_B" 223}) because the
   part to the right of the `@' specifies a nested series of
   `domains'; for example, esr@snark.thyrsus.com specifies
   the machine called snark in the subdomain called thyrsus
   within the top-level domain called com.  See also
   @{"big-endian" LINK "jarg_B" 622}, sense 2.  2. Said of a site, mailer, or routing
   program which knows how to handle domainist addresses.  3. Said of
   a person (esp. a site admin) who prefers domain addressing,
   supports a domainist mailer, or proselytizes for domainist
   addressing and disdains @{"bang path" LINK "jarg_B" 223}s.  This term is now (1996)
   obsolete, as effectively all sites have converted.

@{b}Don't do that, then!@{ub}  [from an old doctor's office joke
   about a patient with a trivial complaint] Stock response to a user
   complaint.  "When I type control-S, the whole system comes to a
   halt for thirty seconds."  "Don't do that, then!" (or "So don't
   do that!").  Compare @{"RTFM" LINK "jarg_R" 639}.

@{b}dongle@{ub} /dong'gl/ n.  1. A security or @{"copy protection" LINK "jarg_C" 1122}
   device for commercial microcomputer programs consisting of a
   serialized EPROM and some drivers in a D-25 connector shell, which
   must be connected to an I/O port of the computer while the program
   is run.  Programs that use a dongle query the port at startup and
   at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate if it does not
   respond with the dongle's programmed validation code.  Thus, users
   can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay
   for each dongle.  The idea was clever, but it was initially a
   failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this way.  Almost
   all dongles on the market today (1993) will pass data through the
   port and monitor for @{"magic" LINK "jarg_M" 76} codes (and combinations of status
   lines) with minimal if any interference with devices further down
   the line -- this innovation was necessary to allow daisy-chained
   dongles for multiple pieces of software.  The devices are still not
   widely used, as the industry has moved away from copy-protection
   schemes in general.  2. By extension, any physical electronic key
   or transferable ID required for a program to function.  Common
   variations on this theme have used parallel or even joystick ports.
   See @{"dongle-disk" LINK "jarg_D" 799}.

   [Note: in early 1992, advertising copy from Rainbow Technologies (a
   manufacturer of dongles) included a claim that the word derived
   from "Don Gall", allegedly the inventor of the device.  The
   company's receptionist will cheerfully tell you that the story is a
   myth invented for the ad copy.  Nevertheless, I expect it to haunt
   my life as a lexicographer for at least the next ten years. ---
   ESR]

@{b}dongle-disk@{ub} /don'gl disk/ n.  A special floppy disk that
   is required in order to perform some task.  Some contain special
   coding that allows an application to identify it uniquely, others
   *are* special code that does something that normally-resident
   programs don't or can't.  (For example, AT&T's "Unix PC" would
   only come up in @{"root mode" LINK "jarg_R" 590} with a special boot disk.)  Also
   called a `key disk'.  See @{"dongle" LINK "jarg_D" 770}.

@{b}donuts@{ub} n.obs.  A collective noun for any set of memory bits.
   This usage is extremely archaic and may no longer be live jargon;
   it dates from the days of ferrite-@{"core" LINK "jarg_C" 1143} memories in which each
   bit was implemented by a doughnut-shaped magnetic flip-flop.

@{b}doorstop@{ub} n.  Used to describe equipment that is
   non-functional and halfway expected to remain so, especially
   obsolete equipment kept around for political reasons or ostensibly
   as a backup.  "When we get another Wyse-50 in here, that ADM 3
   will turn into a doorstop."  Compare @{"boat anchor" LINK "jarg_B" 1282}.

@{b}dot file@{ub} [Unix] n.  A file that is not visible by default to
   normal directory-browsing tools (on Unix, files named with a
   leading dot are, by convention, not normally presented in directory
   listings).  Many programs define one or more dot files in which
   startup or configuration information may be optionally recorded; a
   user can customize the program's behavior by creating the
   appropriate file in the current or home directory.  (Therefore, dot
   files tend to @{"creep" LINK "jarg_C" 1391} -- with every nontrivial application
   program defining at least one, a user's home directory can be
   filled with scores of dot files, of course without the user's
   really being aware of it.)  See also @{"profile" LINK "jarg_P" 920} (sense 1), @{"rc file" LINK "jarg_R" 159}.

@{b}double bucky@{ub} adj.  Using both the CTRL and META keys.  "The
   command to burn all LEDs is double bucky F."

   This term originated on the Stanford extended-ASCII keyboard, and
   was later taken up by users of the @{"space-cadet keyboard" LINK "jarg_S" 1325} at
   MIT.  A typical MIT comment was that the Stanford @{"bucky bits" LINK "jarg_B" 1894}
   (control and meta shifting keys) were nice, but there weren't
   enough of them; you could type only 512 different characters on a
   Stanford keyboard.  An obvious way to address this was simply to
   add more shifting keys, and this was eventually done; but a
   keyboard with that many shifting keys is hard on touch-typists, who
   don't like to move their hands away from the home position on the
   keyboard.  It was half-seriously suggested that the extra shifting
   keys be implemented as pedals; typing on such a keyboard would be
   very much like playing a full pipe organ.  This idea is mentioned
   in a parody of a very fine song by Jeffrey Moss called
   "Rubber Duckie", which was published in "The Sesame
   Street Songbook" (Simon and Schuster 1971, ISBN 0-671-21036-X).
   These lyrics were written on May 27, 1978, in celebration of the
   Stanford keyboard:

     			Double Bucky

     	Double bucky, you're the one!
     	You make my keyboard lots of fun.
     	    Double bucky, an additional bit or two:
     	(Vo-vo-de-o!)
     	Control and meta, side by side,
     	Augmented ASCII, nine bits wide!
     	    Double bucky!  Half a thousand glyphs, plus a few!
     		Oh,
     		I sure wish that I
     		Had a couple of
     		    Bits more!
     		Perhaps a
     		Set of pedals to
     		Make the number of
     		    Bits four:
     		Double double bucky!
     	Double bucky, left and right
     	OR'd together, outta sight!
     	    Double bucky, I'd like a whole word of
     	    Double bucky, I'm happy I heard of
     	    Double bucky, I'd like a whole word of you!

     	--- The Great Quux (with apologies to Jeffrey Moss)

   -- ESR] See also @{"meta bit" LINK "jarg_M" 494}, @{"cokebottle" LINK "jarg_C" 686}, and @{"quadruple bucky" LINK "jarg_Q" 8}.

@{b}double DECkers@{ub} n.  Used to describe married couples in which
   both partners work for Digital Equipment Corporation.

@{b}doubled sig@{ub} [Usenet] n.  A @{"sig block" LINK "jarg_S" 767} that has been
   included twice in a @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190} article or, less commonly, in an
   electronic mail message.  An article or message with a doubled sig
   can be caused by improperly configured software.  More often,
   however, it reveals the author's lack of experience in electronic
   communication.  See @{"B1FF" LINK "jarg_B" 554}, @{"pseudo" LINK "jarg_P" 1014}.

@{b}down@{ub}  1. adj. Not operating.  "The up escalator is down"
   is considered a humorous thing to say, and "The elevator is down"
   always means "The elevator isn't working" and never refers to
   what floor the elevator is on.  With respect to computers, this
   term has passed into the mainstream; the extension to other kinds
   of machine is still hackish.  2. `go down' vi. To stop
   functioning; usually said of the @{"system" LINK "jarg_S" 1950}.  The message from the
   @{"console" LINK "jarg_C" 975} that every hacker hates to hear from the operator is
   "System going down in 5 minutes".  3. `take down', `bring
   down' vt. To deactivate purposely, usually for repair work or
   @{"PM" LINK "jarg_P" 713}.  "I'm taking the system down to work on that bug in the
   tape drive."  Occasionally one hears the word `down' by itself
   used as a verb in this vt. sense.  See @{"crash" LINK "jarg_C" 1306}; oppose @{"up" LINK "jarg_U" 162}.

@{b}download@{ub} vt.  To transfer data or (esp.) code from a
   larger `host' system (esp. a @{"mainframe" LINK "jarg_M" 210}) over a digital
   comm link to a smaller `client' system, esp. a microcomputer
   or specialized peripheral.  Oppose @{"upload" LINK "jarg_U" 167}.

   However, note that ground-to-space communications has its own usage
   rule for this term.  Space-to-earth transmission is always `down'
   and the reverse `up' regardless of the relative size of the
   computers involved.  So far the in-space machines have invariably
   been smaller; thus the upload/download distinction has been
   reversed from its usual sense.

@{b}DP@{ub} /D-P/ n.  1. Data Processing.  Listed here because,
   according to hackers, use of the term marks one immediately as a
   @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}.  See @{"DPer" LINK "jarg_D" 929}.  2. Common abbrev for @{"Dissociated Press" LINK "jarg_D" 648}.

@{b}DPB@{ub} /d*-pib'/ vt.  [from the PDP-10 instruction set] To
   plop something down in the middle.  Usage: silly.  "DPB yourself
   into that couch there."  The connotation would be that the couch
   is full except for one slot just big enough for one last person to
   sit in.  DPB means `DePosit Byte', and was the name of a PDP-10
   instruction that inserts some bits into the middle of some other
   bits.  Hackish usage has been kept alive by the Common LISP
   function of the same name.

@{b}DPer@{ub} /dee-pee-er/ n.  Data Processor.  Hackers are
   absolutely amazed that @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}s use this term self-referentially.
   *Computers* process data, not people!  See @{"DP" LINK "jarg_D" 916}.

@{b}dragon@{ub} n.  [MIT] A program similar to a @{"daemon" LINK "jarg_D" 6}, except
   that it is not invoked at all, but is instead used by the system to
   perform various secondary tasks.  A typical example would be an
   accounting program, which keeps track of who is logged in,
   accumulates load-average statistics, etc.  Under ITS, many
   terminals displayed a list of people logged in, where they were,
   what they were running, etc., along with some random picture (such
   as a unicorn, Snoopy, or the Enterprise), which was generated by
   the `name dragon'.  Usage: rare outside MIT -- under Unix and most
   other OSes this would be called a `background demon' or
   @{"daemon" LINK "jarg_D" 6}.  The best-known Unix example of a dragon is
   `cron(1)'.  At SAIL, they called this sort of thing a
   `phantom'.

@{b}Dragon Book@{ub} n.  The classic text "Compilers:
   Principles, Techniques and Tools", by Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi,
   and Jeffrey D.  Ullman (Addison-Wesley 1986; ISBN 0-201-10088-6),
   so called because of the cover design featuring a dragon labeled
   `complexity of compiler design' and a knight bearing the lance
   `LALR parser generator' among his other trappings.  This one is
   more specifically known as the `Red Dragon Book' (1986); an earlier
   edition, sans Sethi and titled "Principles Of Compiler Design"
   (Alfred V. Aho and Jeffrey D. Ullman; Addison-Wesley, 1977; ISBN
   0-201-00022-9), was the `Green Dragon Book' (1977).  (Also `New
   Dragon Book', `Old Dragon Book'.)  The horsed knight and the
   Green Dragon were warily eying each other at a distance; now the
   knight is typing (wearing gauntlets!) at a terminal showing a
   video-game representation of the Red Dragon's head while the rest
   of the beast extends back in normal space.  See also @{"book titles" LINK "jarg_B" 1461}.

@{b}drain@{ub} v.  [IBM] Syn. for @{"flush" LINK "jarg_F" 735} (sense 2).  Has a
   connotation of finality about it; one speaks of draining a device
   before taking it offline.

@{b}dread high-bit disease@{ub} n.  A condition endemic to PRIME
   (a.k.a.  PR1ME) minicomputers that results in all the characters
   having their high (0x80) bit ON rather than OFF.  This of course
   makes transporting files to other systems much more difficult, not
   to mention talking to true 8-bit devices.  Folklore had it that
   PRIME adopted the reversed-8-bit convention in order to save 25
   cents per serial line per machine; PRIME old-timers, on the other
   hand, claim they inherited the disease from Honeywell via customer
   NASA's compatibility requirements and struggled heroically to cure
   it.  Whoever was responsible, this probably qualifies as one of the
   most @{"cretinous" LINK "jarg_C" 1436} design tradeoffs ever made.  See @{"meta bit" LINK "jarg_M" 494}.
   A few other machines have exhibited similar brain damage.

@{b}DRECNET@{ub} /drek'net/ n.  [from Yiddish/German `dreck',
   meaning filth] Deliberate distortion of DECNET, a networking
   protocol used in the @{"VMS" LINK "jarg_V" 362} community.  So called because DEC
   helped write the Ethernet specification and then (either stupidly
   or as a malignant customer-control tactic) violated that spec in
   the design of DRECNET in a way that made it incompatible.  See also
   @{"connector conspiracy" LINK "jarg_C" 918}.

@{b}driver@{ub} n.  1. The @{"main loop" LINK "jarg_M" 206} of an event-processing
   program; the code that gets commands and dispatches them for
   execution.  2. [techspeak] In `device driver', code designed to
   handle a particular peripheral device such as a magnetic disk or
   tape unit.  3. In the TeX world and the computerized typesetting
   world in general, a program that translates some device-independent
   or other common format to something a real device can actually
   understand.

@{b}droid@{ub} n.  [from `android', SF terminology for a humanoid
   robot of essentially biological (as opposed to
   mechanical/electronic) construction] A person (esp. a
   low-level bureaucrat or service-business employee) exhibiting most
   of the following characteristics: (a) naive trust in the wisdom of
   the parent organization or `the system'; (b) a blind-faith
   propensity to believe obvious nonsense emitted by authority figures
   (or computers!); (c) a rule-governed mentality, one unwilling or
   unable to look beyond the `letter of the law' in exceptional
   situations; (d) a paralyzing fear of official reprimand or worse if
   Procedures are not followed No Matter What; and (e) no interest in
   doing anything above or beyond the call of a very
   narrowly-interpreted duty, or in particular in fixing that which is
   broken; an "It's not my job, man" attitude.

   Typical droid positions include supermarket checkout assistant and
   bank clerk; the syndrome is also endemic in low-level government
   employees.  The implication is that the rules and official
   procedures constitute software that the droid is executing;
   problems arise when the software has not been properly debugged.
   The term `droid mentality' is also used to describe the mindset
   behind this behavior. Compare @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}, @{"marketroid" LINK "jarg_M" 299}; see
   @{"-oid" LINK "jarg_alph" 28}.

@{b}drool-proof paper@{ub} n.  Documentation that has been
   obsessively @{"dumbed down" LINK "jarg_D" 1125}, to the point where only a @{"cretin" LINK "jarg_C" 1429}
   could bear to read it, is said to have succumbed to the
   `drool-proof paper syndrome' or to have been `written on
   drool-proof paper'.  For example, this is an actual quote from
   Apple's LaserWriter manual: "Do not expose your LaserWriter to
   open fire or flame."

@{b}drop on the floor@{ub} vt.  To react to an error condition by
   silently discarding messages or other valuable data.  "The gateway
   ran out of memory, so it just started dropping packets on the
   floor."  Also frequently used of faulty mail and netnews relay
   sites that lose messages.  See also @{"black hole" LINK "jarg_B" 950}, @{"bit bucket" LINK "jarg_B" 787}.

@{b}drop-ins@{ub} n.  [prob. by analogy with @{"drop-outs" LINK "jarg_D" 1041}]
   Spurious characters appearing on a terminal or console as a result
   of line noise or a system malfunction of some sort.  Esp. used
   when these are interspersed with one's own typed input.  Compare
   @{"drop-outs" LINK "jarg_D" 1041}, sense 2.

@{b}drop-outs@{ub} n.  1. A variety of `power glitch' (see
   @{"glitch" LINK "jarg_G" 311}); momentary 0 voltage on the electrical mains.
   2. Missing characters in typed input due to software malfunction or
   system saturation (one cause of such behavior under Unix when a bad
   connection to a modem swamps the processor with spurious character
   interrupts; see @{"screaming tty" LINK "jarg_S" 391}).  3. Mental glitches; used as a
   way of describing those occasions when the mind just seems to shut
   down for a couple of beats.  See @{"glitch" LINK "jarg_G" 311}, @{"fried" LINK "jarg_F" 1142}.

@{b}drugged@{ub} adj.  (also `on drugs') 1. Conspicuously stupid,
   heading toward @{"brain-damaged" LINK "jarg_B" 1633}.  Often accompanied by a
   pantomime of toking a joint.  2. Of hardware, very slow relative to
   normal performance.

@{b}drum@{ub} adj, n.  Ancient techspeak term referring to slow,
   cylindrical magnetic media that were once state-of-the-art storage
   devices.  Under BSD Unix the disk partition used for swapping is
   still called `/dev/drum'; this has led to considerable humor
   and not a few straight-faced but utterly bogus `explanations'
   getting foisted on @{"newbie" LINK "jarg_N" 361}s.  See also 
   "@{"The Story of Mel, a Real Programmer" LINK "jarg_app" 460}" in Appendix A.

@{b}drunk mouse syndrome@{ub} n.  (also `mouse on drugs') A malady
   exhibited by the mouse pointing device of some computers.  The
   typical symptom is for the mouse cursor on the screen to move in
   random directions and not in sync with the motion of the actual
   mouse.  Can usually be corrected by unplugging the mouse and
   plugging it back again.  Another recommended fix for optical mice
   is to rotate your mouse pad 90 degrees.

   At Xerox PARC in the 1970s, most people kept a can of copier
   cleaner (isopropyl alcohol) at their desks.  When the steel ball on
   the mouse had picked up enough @{"cruft" LINK "jarg_C" 1508} to be unreliable, the
   mouse was doused in cleaner, which restored it for a while.
   However, this operation left a fine residue that accelerated the
   accumulation of cruft, so the dousings became more and more
   frequent.  Finally, the mouse was declared `alcoholic' and sent
   to the clinic to be dried out in a CFC ultrasonic bath.

@{b}Duff's device@{ub} n.  The most dramatic use yet seen of @{"fall through" LINK "jarg_F" 10}
   in C, invented by Tom Duff when he was at Lucasfilm.
   Trying to @{"bum" LINK "jarg_B" 2062} all the instructions he could out of an inner
   loop that copied data serially onto an output port, he decided to
   unroll it.  He then realized that the unrolled version could be
   implemented by *interlacing* the structures of a switch and a
   loop:

        register n = (count + 7) / 8;      /* count > 0 assumed */

        switch (count % 8)
        {
        case 0:        do {  *to = *from++;
        case 7:              *to = *from++;
        case 6:              *to = *from++;
        case 5:              *to = *from++;
        case 4:              *to = *from++;
        case 3:              *to = *from++;
        case 2:              *to = *from++;
        case 1:              *to = *from++;
                           } while (--n > 0);
        }

   Shocking though it appears to all who encounter it for the first
   time, the device is actually perfectly valid, legal C.  C's default
   @{"fall through" LINK "jarg_F" 10} in case statements has long been its most
   controversial single feature; Duff observed that "This code forms
   some sort of argument in that debate, but I'm not sure whether it's
   for or against."

   [For maximal obscurity, the outermost pair of braces above could be
   actually be removed -- GLS]

@{b}dumb terminal@{ub} n.  A terminal that is one step above a
   @{"glass tty" LINK "jarg_G" 296}, having a minimally addressable cursor but no
   on-screen editing or other features normally supported by a
   @{"smart terminal" LINK "jarg_S" 931}.  Once upon a time, when glass ttys were common
   and addressable cursors were something special, what is now called
   a dumb terminal could pass for a smart terminal.

@{b}dumbass attack@{ub} /duhm'as *-tak'/ n.  [Purdue] Notional
   cause of a novice's mistake made by the experienced, especially one
   made while running as @{"root" LINK "jarg_R" 583} under Unix, e.g., typing `rm
   -r *' or `mkfs' on a mounted file system.  Compare @{"adger" LINK "jarg_A" 98}.

@{b}dumbed down@{ub} adj.  Simplified, with a strong connotation of
   *over*simplified.  Often, a @{"marketroid" LINK "jarg_M" 299} will insist that
   the interfaces and documentation of software be dumbed down after
   the designer has burned untold gallons of midnight oil making it
   smart.  This creates friction.  See @{"user-friendly" LINK "jarg_U" 229}.

@{b}dump@{ub} n.  1. An undigested and voluminous mass of information
   about a problem or the state of a system, especially one routed to
   the slowest available output device (compare @{"core dump" LINK "jarg_C" 1156}), and
   most especially one consisting of hex or octal @{"runes" LINK "jarg_R" 710}
   describing the byte-by-byte state of memory, mass storage, or some
   file.  In @{"elder days" LINK "jarg_E" 102}, debugging was generally done by
   `groveling over' a dump (see @{"grovel" LINK "jarg_G" 803}); increasing use of
   high-level languages and interactive debuggers has made such tedium
   uncommon, and the term `dump' now has a faintly archaic flavor.
   2. A backup.  This usage is typical only at large timesharing
   installations.

@{b}dumpster diving@{ub} /dump'-ster di:'-ving/ n.  1. The practice
   of sifting refuse from an office or technical installation to
   extract confidential data, especially security-compromising
   information (`dumpster' is an Americanism for what is elsewhere
   called a `skip').  Back in AT&T's monopoly days, before paper
   shredders became common office equipment, phone phreaks (see
   @{"phreaking" LINK "jarg_P" 461}) used to organize regular dumpster runs against
   phone company plants and offices.  Discarded and damaged copies of
   AT&T internal manuals taught them much.  The technique is still
   rumored to be a favorite of crackers operating against careless
   targets.  2. The practice of raiding the dumpsters behind buildings
   where producers and/or consumers of high-tech equipment are
   located, with the expectation (usually justified) of finding
   discarded but still-valuable equipment to be nursed back to health
   in some hacker's den.  Experienced dumpster-divers not infrequently
   accumulate basements full of moldering (but still potentially
   useful) @{"cruft" LINK "jarg_C" 1508}.

@{b}dup killer@{ub} /d[y]oop kill'r/ n.  [FidoNet] Software that is
   supposed to detect and delete duplicates of a message that may have
   reached the FidoNet system via different routes.

@{b}dup loop@{ub} /d[y]oop loop/ (also `dupe loop') n.  [FidoNet]
   An infinite stream of duplicated, near-identical messages on a
   FidoNet @{"echo" LINK "jarg_E" 53}, the only difference being unique or mangled
   identification information applied by a faulty or incorrectly
   configured system or network gateway, thus rendering @{"dup killer" LINK "jarg_D" 1161}s
   ineffective.  If such a duplicate message eventually
   reaches a system through which it has already passed (with the
   original identification information), all systems passed on the way
   back to that system are said to be involved in a @{"dup loop" LINK "jarg_D" 1165}.

@{b}dusty deck@{ub} n.  Old software (especially applications) which
   one is obliged to remain compatible with, or to maintain (@{"DP" LINK "jarg_D" 916}
   types call this `legacy code', a term hackers consider smarmy and
   excessively reverent).  The term implies that the software in
   question is a holdover from card-punch days.  Used esp. when
   referring to old scientific and @{"number-crunching" LINK "jarg_N" 655} software,
   much of which was written in FORTRAN and very poorly documented but
   is believed to be too expensive to replace.  See @{"fossil" LINK "jarg_F" 1071};
   compare @{"crawling horror" LINK "jarg_C" 1333}.

@{b}DWIM@{ub} /dwim/  [acronym, `Do What I Mean'] 1. adj. Able to
   guess, sometimes even correctly, the result intended when bogus
   input was provided.  2. n.,obs. The BBNLISP/INTERLISP function that
   attempted to accomplish this feat by correcting many of the more
   common errors.  See @{"hairy" LINK "jarg_H" 247}.  3. Occasionally, an interjection
   hurled at a balky computer, esp. when one senses one might be
   tripping over legalisms (see @{"legalese" LINK "jarg_L" 151}).

   Warren Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and
   spelling errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and
   would often make hash of anyone else's typos if they were
   stylistically different.  Some victims of DWIM thus claimed that
   the acronym stood for `Damn Warren's Infernal Machine!'.

   In one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the
   command interpreter used at Xerox PARC.  One day another hacker
   there typed `delete *$' to free up some disk space.  (The
   editor there named backup files by appending `$' to the
   original file name, so he was trying to delete any backup files
   left over from old editing sessions.)  It happened that there
   weren't any editor backup files, so DWIM helpfully reported
   `*$ not found, assuming you meant 'delete *'.' It then started
   to delete all the files on the disk!  The hacker managed to stop it
   with a @{"Vulcan nerve pinch" LINK "jarg_V" 403} after only a half dozen or so files
   were lost.
   
   The disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go
   to Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his
   workstation, and then type `delete *$' twice.

   DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex
   program; it is also occasionally described as the single
   instruction the ideal computer would have.  Back when proofs of
   program correctness were in vogue, there were also jokes about
   `DWIMC' (Do What I Mean, Correctly).  A related term, more often
   seen as a verb, is DTRT (Do The Right Thing); see @{"Right Thing" LINK "jarg_R" 523}.

@{b}dynner@{ub} /din'r/  32 bits, by analogy with @{"nybble" LINK "jarg_N" 681} and
   @{"byte" LINK "jarg_B" 2162}.  Usage: rare and extremely silly.  See also @{"playte" LINK "jarg_P" 649},
   @{"tayste" LINK "jarg_T" 266}, @{"crumb" LINK "jarg_C" 1551}.  General discussion of such terms is under
   @{"nybble" LINK "jarg_N" 681}.

@node jarg_E "E"
@{b}earthquake@{ub} n.  [IBM] The ultimate real-world shock test for
   computer hardware.  Hackish sources at IBM deny the rumor that the
   Bay Area quake of 1989 was initiated by the company to test
   quality-assurance procedures at its California plants.

@{b}Easter egg@{ub} n.  [from the custom of the Easter Egg hunt
   observed in the U.S. and many parts of Europe] 1. A message hidden
   in the object code of a program as a joke, intended to be found by
   persons disassembling or browsing the code.  2. A message, graphic,
   or sound effect emitted by a program (or, on a PC, the BIOS ROM) in
   response to some undocumented set of commands or keystrokes,
   intended as a joke or to display program credits.  One well-known
   early Easter egg found in a couple of OSes caused them to respond
   to the command `make love' with `not war?'.  Many
   personal computers have much more elaborate eggs hidden in ROM,
   including lists of the developers' names, political exhortations,
   snatches of music, and (in one case) graphics images of the entire
   development team.

@{b}Easter egging@{ub} n.  [IBM] The act of replacing unrelated
   components more or less at random in hopes that a malfunction will
   go away.  Hackers consider this the normal operating mode of
   @{"field circus" LINK "jarg_F" 356} techs and do not love them for it.  See also the
   jokes under @{"field circus" LINK "jarg_F" 356}.  Compare @{"shotgun debugging" LINK "jarg_S" 703}.

@{b}eat flaming death@{ub} imp.  A construction popularized among
   hackers by the infamous @{"CPU Wars" LINK "jarg_C" 1236} comic; supposedly derive from
   a famously turgid line in a WWII-era anti-Nazi propaganda comic
   that ran "Eat flaming death, non-Aryan mongrels!" or something
   of the sort (however, it is also reported that the Firesign
   Theater's 1975 album "In The Next World, You're On Your Own"
   included the phrase "Eat flaming death, fascist media pigs"; this
   may have been an influence).  Used in humorously overblown
   expressions of hostility. "Eat flaming death, @{"EBCDIC" LINK "jarg_E" 36} users!"

@{b}@{u}EBCDIC@{uu}@{ub} /eb's*-dik/, /eb'see`dik/, or /eb'k*-dik/ n. 
   [abbreviation, Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code] An
   alleged character set used on IBM @{"dinosaur" LINK "jarg_D" 568}s.  It exists in at
   least six mutually incompatible versions, all featuring such
   delights as non-contiguous letter sequences and the absence of
   several ASCII punctuation characters fairly important for modern
   computer languages (exactly which characters are absent varies
   according to which version of EBCDIC you're looking at).  IBM
   adapted EBCDIC from @{"punched card" LINK "jarg_P" 1073} code in the early 1960s and
   promulgated it as a customer-control tactic (see 
   @{"connector conspiracy" LINK "jarg_C" 918}), spurning the already established ASCII 
   standard.  Today, IBM claims to be an open-systems company, but IBM's 
   own description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them
   is still internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading.
   Hackers blanch at the very *name* of EBCDIC and consider it a
   manifestation of purest @{"evil" LINK "jarg_E" 426}.  See also @{"fear and loathing" LINK "jarg_F" 143}.

@{b}echo@{ub} [FidoNet] n.  A @{"topic group" LINK "jarg_T" 879} on @{"FidoNet" LINK "jarg_F" 348}'s
   echomail system.  Compare @{"newsgroup" LINK "jarg_N" 412}.

@{b}eighty-column mind@{ub} n.  [IBM] The sort said to be possessed by
   persons for whom the transition from @{"punched card" LINK "jarg_P" 1073} to tape was
   traumatic (nobody has dared tell them about disks yet).  It is said
   that these people, including (according to an old joke) the founder
   of IBM, will be buried `face down, 9-edge first' (the 9-edge being
   the bottom of the card).  This directive is inscribed on IBM's 1402
   and 1622 card readers and is referenced in a famous bit of doggerel
   called "The Last Bug", the climactic lines of which are as
   follows:

        He died at the console
        Of hunger and thirst.
        Next day he was buried,
        Face down, 9-edge first.

   The eighty-column mind is thought by most hackers to dominate IBM's
   customer base and its thinking.  See @{"IBM" LINK "jarg_I" 21}, @{"fear and loathing" LINK "jarg_F" 143}, 
   @{"card walloper" LINK "jarg_C" 144}.

@{b}El Camino Bignum@{ub} /el' k*-mee'noh big'nuhm/ n.  The road
   mundanely called El Camino Real, a road through the San Francisco
   peninsula that originally extended all the way down to Mexico City
   and many portions of which are still intact.  Navigation on the San
   Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real,
   which defines @{"logical" LINK "jarg_L" 496} north and south even though it isn't
   really north-south in many places.  El Camino Real runs right past
   Stanford University and so is familiar to hackers.

   The Spanish word `real' (which has two syllables: /ray-ol'/)
   means `royal'; El Camino Real is `the royal road'.  In the FORTRAN
   language, a `real' quantity is a number typically precise to seven
   significant digits, and a `double precision' quantity is a larger
   floating-point number, precise to perhaps fourteen significant
   digits (other languages have similar `real' types).

   When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976, he remarked what a
   long road El Camino Real was.  Making a pun on `real', he started
   calling it `El Camino Double Precision' -- but when the hacker
   was told that the road was hundreds of miles long, he renamed it
   `El Camino Bignum', and that name has stuck.  (See @{"bignum" LINK "jarg_B" 644}.)
   In recent years, the synonym `El Camino Virtual' has been
   reported as an alternate at IBM and Amdahl sites in the Valley.

   [GLS has since let slip that the unnamed hacker in this story was
   in fact him -- ESR]

@{b}elder days@{ub} n.  The heroic age of hackerdom (roughly,
   pre-1980); the era of the @{"PDP-10" LINK "jarg_P" 264}, @{"TECO" LINK "jarg_T" 312}, @{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463}, and the
   ARPANET.  This term has been rather consciously adopted from
   J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy epic "The Lord of the Rings".
   Compare @{"Iron Age" LINK "jarg_I" 433}; see also @{"elvish" LINK "jarg_E" 172} and @{"Great Worm, the" LINK "jarg_G" 614}.

@{b}elegant@{ub} adj.  [from mathematical usage] Combining
   simplicity, power, and a certain ineffable grace of design.  Higher
   praise than `clever', `winning', or even @{"cuspy" LINK "jarg_C" 1621}.

   The French aviator, adventurer, and author Antoine de
   Saint-Exup'ery, probably best known for his classic children's
   book "The Little Prince", was also an aircraft designer.  He
   gave us perhaps the best definition of engineering elegance when he
   said "A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there
   is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take
   away."

@{b}elephantine@{ub} adj.  Used of programs or systems that are both
   conspicuous @{"hog" LINK "jarg_H" 727}s (owing perhaps to poor design founded on
   @{"brute force and ignorance" LINK "jarg_B" 1845}) and exceedingly @{"hairy" LINK "jarg_H" 247} in
   source form.  An elephantine program may be functional and even
   friendly, but (as in the old joke about being in bed with an
   elephant) it's tough to have around all the same (and, like a
   pachyderm, difficult to maintain).  In extreme cases, hackers have
   been known to make trumpeting sounds or perform expressive
   proboscatory mime at the mention of the offending program.  Usage:
   semi-humorous.  Compare `has the elephant nature' and the
   somewhat more pejorative @{"monstrosity" LINK "jarg_M" 911}.  See also
   @{"second-system effect" LINK "jarg_S" 462} and @{"baroque" LINK "jarg_B" 331}.

@{b}elevator controller@{ub} n.  An archetypal dumb embedded-systems
   application, like @{"toaster" LINK "jarg_T" 823} (which superseded it).  During one
   period (1983--84) in the deliberations of ANSI X3J11 (the C
   standardization committee) this was the canonical example of a
   really stupid, memory-limited computation environment.  "You can't
   require `printf(3)' to be part of the default runtime library
   -- what if you're targeting an elevator controller?"  Elevator
   controllers became important rhetorical weapons on both sides of
   several @{"holy wars" LINK "jarg_H" 753}.

@{b}elite@{ub} adj.  Clueful.  Plugged-in.  One of the cognoscenti.
   Also used as a general positive adjective.  This term is not
   actually hacker slang in the strict sense; it is used primarily by
   crackers and @{"warez d00dz" LINK "jarg_W" 199}.  Cracker usage is probaby related to
   a 19200cps modem called the `Courier Elite' that was widely popular
   on pirate boards before the V.32bis standard.  A true hacker would
   be more likely to use `wizardly'. Oppose @{"lamer" LINK "jarg_L" 11}.

@{b}ELIZA effect@{ub} /*-li:'z* *-fekt'/ n.  [AI community] The
   tendency of humans to attach associations to terms from prior
   experience.  For example, there is nothing magic about the symbol
   `+' that makes it well-suited to indicate addition; it's just
   that people associate it with addition.  Using `+' or `plus'
   to mean addition in a computer language is taking advantage of the
   ELIZA effect.

   This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum,
   which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by rephrasing many of
   the patient's statements as questions and posing them to the
   patient.  It worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution
   of key words into canned phrases.  It was so convincing, however,
   that there are many anecdotes about people becoming very
   emotionally caught up in dealing with ELIZA.  All this was due to
   people's tendency to attach to words meanings which the computer
   never put there.  The ELIZA effect is a @{"Good Thing" LINK "jarg_G" 480} when
   writing a programming language, but it can blind you to serious
   shortcomings when analyzing an Artificial Intelligence system.
   Compare @{"ad-hockery" LINK "jarg_A" 69}; see also @{"AI-complete" LINK "jarg_A" 145}.

@{b}elvish@{ub} n.  1. The Tengwar of Feanor, a table of letterforms
   resembling the beautiful Celtic half-uncial hand of the "Book
   of Kells".  Invented and described by J. R. R. Tolkien in "The
   Lord of The Rings" as an orthography for his fictional `elvish'
   languages, this system (which is both visually and phonetically
   @{"elegant" LINK "jarg_E" 108}) has long fascinated hackers (who tend to be intrigued
   by artificial languages in general).  It is traditional for
   graphics printers, plotters, window systems, and the like to
   support a Feanorian typeface as one of their demo items.  See also
   @{"elder days" LINK "jarg_E" 102}.  2. By extension, any odd or unreadable typeface
   produced by a graphics device.  3. The typeface mundanely called
   `B"ocklin', an art-decoish display font.

@{b}EMACS@{ub} /ee'maks/ n.  [from Editing MACroS] The ne plus
   ultra of hacker editors, a programmable text editor with an entire
   LISP system inside it.  It was originally written by Richard
   Stallman in @{"TECO" LINK "jarg_T" 312} under @{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463} at the MIT AI lab; AI Memo 554
   described it as "an advanced, self-documenting, customizable,
   extensible real-time display editor".  It has since been
   reimplemented any number of times, by various hackers, and versions
   exist that run under most major operating systems.  Perhaps the
   most widely used version, also written by Stallman and now called
   "@{"GNU" LINK "jarg_G" 383} EMACS" or @{"GNUMACS" LINK "jarg_G" 401}, runs principally under Unix.
   It includes facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and
   receive mail; many hackers spend up to 80% of their @{"tube time" LINK "jarg_T" 1121}
   inside it.  Other variants include @{"GOSMACS" LINK "jarg_G" 538}, CCA EMACS,
   UniPress EMACS, Montgomery EMACS, jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS.

   Some EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an
   overflowing kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the
   editor does not (yet) include.  Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too
   @{"heavyweight" LINK "jarg_H" 567} and @{"baroque" LINK "jarg_B" 331} for their taste, and expand the
   name as `Escape Meta Alt Control Shift' to spoof its heavy reliance
   on keystrokes decorated with @{"bucky bits" LINK "jarg_B" 1894}.  Other spoof
   expansions include `Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping',
   `Eventually `malloc()'s All Computer Storage', and `EMACS
   Makes A Computer Slow' (see @{"recursive acronym" LINK "jarg_R" 300}).  See
   also @{"vi" LINK "jarg_V" 248}.

@{b}email@{ub} /ee'mayl/  (also written `e-mail' and `E'-mail')
   1. n. Electronic mail automatically passed through computer
   networks and/or via modems over common-carrier lines.  Contrast
   @{"snail-mail" LINK "jarg_S" 1106}, @{"paper-net" LINK "jarg_P" 36}, @{"voice-net" LINK "jarg_V" 383}.  See @{"network address" LINK "jarg_N" 296}.
   2. vt. To send electronic mail.

   Oddly enough, the word `emailed' is actually listed in the OED;
   it means "embossed (with a raised pattern) or perh. arranged in a
   net or open work".  A use from 1480 is given. The word is derived
   from Old French `emmaill"ure', network.  A French correspondent
   tells us that in modern French, `email' is a hard enamel obtained
   by heating special paints in a furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e)
   is a craftsman who makes email (he generally paints some objects
   like jewels and cook them in a furnace).

   There are numerous spelling variants of this word.  By statistical
   analysis of a large volume of Internet traffic, `email'
   predominates, `e-mail' runs a not-too-distant second, and
   `E-mail' and `Email' a distant third and fourth.

@{b}emoticon@{ub} /ee-moh'ti-kon/ n.  An ASCII glyph used to
   indicate an emotional state in email or news.  Although originally
   intended mostly as jokes, emoticons (or some other explicit humor
   indication) are virtually required under certain circumstances in
   high-volume text-only communication forums such as Usenet; the lack
   of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what were intended to
   be humorous, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise non-100%-serious
   comments to be badly misinterpreted (not always even by
   @{"newbie" LINK "jarg_N" 361}s), resulting in arguments and @{"flame war" LINK "jarg_F" 633}s.

   Hundreds of emoticons have been proposed, but only a few are in
   common use.  These include:

     :-)
          `smiley face' (for humor, laughter, friendliness,
          occasionally sarcasm)

     :-(
          `frowney face' (for sadness, anger, or upset)

     ;-)
          `half-smiley' (@{"ha ha only serious" LINK "jarg_H" 14}); also known as
          `semi-smiley' or `winkey face'.

     :-/
          `wry face'

   (These may become more comprehensible if you tilt your head
   sideways, to the left.)

   The first two listed are by far the most frequently encountered.
   Hyphenless forms of them are common on CompuServe, GEnie, and BIX;
   see also @{"bixie" LINK "jarg_B" 933}.  On @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190}, `smiley' is often used as a
   generic term synonymous with @{"emoticon" LINK "jarg_E" 231}, as well as specifically
   for the happy-face emoticon.

   It appears that the emoticon was invented by one Scott Fahlman on
   the CMU @{"bboard" LINK "jarg_B" 422} systems around 1980.  He later wrote: "I wish I
   had saved the original post, or at least recorded the date for
   posterity, but I had no idea that I was starting something that
   would soon pollute all the world's communication channels."  [GLS
   confirms that he remembers this original posting].

   Note for the @{"newbie" LINK "jarg_N" 361}: Overuse of the smiley is a mark of
   loserhood!  More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure sign that
   you've gone over the line.

@{b}empire@{ub} n.  Any of a family of military simulations derived
   from a game written by Peter Langston many years ago.  Five or six
   multi-player variants of varying degrees of sophistication exist,
   and one single-player version implemented for both Unix and VMS;
   the latter is even available as MS-DOS freeware.  All are
   notoriously addictive.

@{b}engine@{ub} n.  1. A piece of hardware that encapsulates some
   function but can't be used without some kind of @{"front end" LINK "jarg_F" 1240}.
   Today we have, especially, `print engine': the guts of a laser
   printer.  2. An analogous piece of software; notionally, one that
   does a lot of noisy crunching, such as a `database engine'.

   The hackish senses of `engine' are actually close to its original,
   pre-Industrial-Revolution sense of a skill, clever device, or
   instrument (the word is cognate to `ingenuity').  This sense had
   not been completely eclipsed by the modern connotation of
   power-transducing machinery in Charles Babbage's time, which
   explains why he named the stored-program computer that
   he designed in 1844 the `Analytical Engine'.

@{b}English@{ub}  1. n.,obs. The source code for a program, which may
   be in any language, as opposed to the linkable or executable binary
   produced from it by a compiler.  The idea behind the term is that
   to a real hacker, a program written in his favorite programming
   language is at least as readable as English.  Usage: mostly by
   old-time hackers, though recognizable in context.  2. The official
   name of the database language used by the Pick Operating System,
   actually a sort of crufty, brain-damaged SQL with delusions of
   grandeur.  The name permits @{"marketroid" LINK "jarg_M" 299}s to say "Yes, and you
   can program our computers in English!" to ignorant @{"suit" LINK "jarg_S" 1760}s
   without quite running afoul of the truth-in-advertising laws.

@{b}enhancement@{ub} n.  Common @{"marketroid" LINK "jarg_M" 299}-speak for a bug
   @{"fix" LINK "jarg_F" 556}.  This abuse of language is a popular and time-tested way
   to turn incompetence into increased revenue.  A hacker being ironic
   would instead call the fix a @{"feature" LINK "jarg_F" 151} -- or perhaps save some
   effort by declaring the bug itself to be a feature.

@{b}ENQ@{ub} /enkw/ or /enk/  [from the ASCII mnemonic ENQuire
   for 0000101] An on-line convention for querying someone's
   availability.  After opening a @{"talk mode" LINK "jarg_T" 19} connection to someone
   apparently in heavy hack mode, one might type `SYN SYN ENQ?'
   (the SYNs representing notional synchronization bytes), and expect
   a return of @{"ACK" LINK "jarg_A" 31} or @{"NAK" LINK "jarg_N" 62} depending on whether or not the
   person felt interruptible.  Compare @{"ping" LINK "jarg_P" 503}, @{"finger" LINK "jarg_F" 451}, and the
   usage of `FOO?' listed under @{"talk mode" LINK "jarg_T" 19}.

@{b}EOF@{ub} /E-O-F/ n.  [abbreviation, `End Of File']
   1. [techspeak] The @{"out-of-band" LINK "jarg_O" 328} value returned by C's
   sequential character-input functions (and their equivalents in
   other environments) when end of file has been reached.  This value
   is -1 under C libraries postdating V6 Unix, but was
   originally 0.  2. [Unix] The keyboard character (usually control-D,
   the ASCII EOT (End Of Transmission) character) that is mapped by
   the terminal driver into an end-of-file condition.  3. Used by
   extension in non-computer contexts when a human is doing something
   that can be modeled as a sequential read and can't go further.
   "Yeah, I looked for a list of 360 mnemonics to post as a joke, but
   I hit EOF pretty fast; all the library had was a @{"JCL" LINK "jarg_J" 32} manual."
   See also @{"EOL" LINK "jarg_E" 340}.

@{b}EOL@{ub} /E-O-L/ n.  [End Of Line] Syn. for @{"newline" LINK "jarg_N" 385},
   derived perhaps from the original CDC6600 Pascal.  Now rare, but
   widely recognized and occasionally used for brevity.  Used in the
   example entry under @{"BNF" LINK "jarg_B" 1225}.  See also @{"EOF" LINK "jarg_E" 326}.

@{b}EOU@{ub} /E-O-U/ n.  The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control
   character (End Of User) that would make an ASR-33 Teletype explode
   on receipt.  This construction parodies the numerous obscure
   delimiter and control characters left in ASCII from the days when
   it was associated more with wire-service teletypes than computers
   (e.g., FS, GS, RS, US, EM, SUB, ETX, and esp. EOT).  It is worth
   remembering that ASR-33s were big, noisy mechanical beasts with a
   lot of clattering parts; the notion that one might explode was
   nowhere near as ridiculous as it might seem to someone sitting in
   front of a @{"tube" LINK "jarg_T" 1114} or flatscreen today.

@{b}epoch@{ub} n.  [Unix: prob. from astronomical timekeeping] The
   time and date corresponding to 0 in an operating system's clock and
   timestamp values.  Under most Unix versions the epoch is 00:00:00
   GMT, January 1, 1970; under VMS, it's 00:00:00 of November 17, 1858
   (base date of the U.S. Naval Observatory's ephemerides); on a
   Macintosh, it's the midnight beginning January 1 1904.  System time
   is measured in seconds or @{"tick" LINK "jarg_T" 639}s past the epoch.  Weird
   problems may ensue when the clock wraps around (see @{"wrap around" LINK "jarg_W" 703}),
   which is not necessarily a rare event; on systems
   counting 10 ticks per second, a signed 32-bit count of ticks is
   good only for 6.8 years.  The 1-tick-per-second clock of Unix is
   good only until January 18, 2038, assuming at least some software
   continues to consider it signed and that word lengths don't
   increase by then.  See also @{"wall time" LINK "jarg_W" 102}.

@{b}epsilon@{ub}  [see @{"delta" LINK "jarg_D" 358}] 1. n. A small quantity of
   anything.  "The cost is epsilon."  2. adj. Very small,
   negligible; less than @{"marginal" LINK "jarg_M" 283}.  "We can get this feature for
   epsilon cost."  3. `within epsilon of': close enough to be
   indistinguishable for all practical purposes, even closer than
   being `within delta of'.  "That's not what I asked for, but it's
   within epsilon of what I wanted."  Alternatively, it may mean not
   close enough, but very little is required to get it there: "My
   program is within epsilon of working."

@{b}epsilon squared@{ub} n.  A quantity even smaller than
   @{"epsilon" LINK "jarg_E" 371}, as small in comparison to epsilon as epsilon is to
   something normal; completely negligible.  If you buy a
   supercomputer for a million dollars, the cost of the
   thousand-dollar terminal to go with it is @{"epsilon" LINK "jarg_E" 371}, and the
   cost of the ten-dollar cable to connect them is epsilon squared.
   Compare @{"lost in the underflow" LINK "jarg_L" 596}, @{"lost in the noise" LINK "jarg_L" 589}.

@{b}era, the@{ub}  Syn. @{"epoch" LINK "jarg_E" 356}.  Webster's Unabridged makes these
   words almost synonymous, but `era' more often connotes a span of
   time rather than a point in time, whereas the reverse is true for
   @{"epoch" LINK "jarg_E" 356}.  The @{"epoch" LINK "jarg_E" 356} usage is recommended.

@{b}Eric Conspiracy@{ub} n.  A shadowy group of mustachioed hackers
   named Eric first pinpointed as a sinister conspiracy by an infamous
   talk.bizarre posting ca. 1986; this was doubtless influenced by
   the numerous `Eric' jokes in the Monty Python oeuvre.  There do
   indeed seem to be considerably more mustachioed Erics in hackerdom
   than the frequency of these three traits can account for unless
   they are correlated in some arcane way.  Well-known examples
   include Eric Allman (he of the `Allman style' described under
   @{"indent style" LINK "jarg_I" 164}) and Erik Fair (co-author of NNTP); your editor
   has heard from about fifteen others by email, and the organization
   line `Eric Conspiracy Secret Laboratories' now emanates regularly
   from more than one site.

@{b}Eris@{ub} /e'ris/ n.  The Greek goddess of Chaos, Discord,
   Confusion, and Things You Know Not Of; her name was latinized to
   Discordia and she was worshiped by that name in Rome.  Not a very
   friendly deity in the Classical original, she was reinvented as a
   more benign personification of creative anarchy starting in 1959 by
   the adherents of @{"Discordianism" LINK "jarg_D" 617} and has since been a
   semi-serious subject of veneration in several `fringe' cultures,
   including hackerdom.  See @{"Discordianism" LINK "jarg_D" 617}, @{"Church of the SubGenius" LINK "jarg_C" 500}.

@{b}erotics@{ub} /ee-ro'tiks/ n.  [Helsinki University of
   Technology, Finland] n. English-language university slang for
   electronics.  Often used by hackers in Helsinki, maybe because good
   electronics excites them and makes them warm.

@{b}error 33@{ub} [XEROX PARC] n.  1. Predicating one research effort
   upon the success of another.  2. Allowing your own research effort
   to be placed on the critical path of some other project (be it a
   research effort or not).

@{b}evil@{ub} adj.  As used by hackers, implies that some system,
   program, person, or institution is sufficiently maldesigned as to
   be not worth the bother of dealing with.  Unlike the adjectives in
   the @{"cretinous" LINK "jarg_C" 1436}/@{"losing" LINK "jarg_L" 568}/@{"brain-damaged" LINK "jarg_B" 1633} series, `evil'
   does not imply incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of
   goals or design criteria fatally incompatible with the speaker's.
   This usage is more an esthetic and engineering judgment than a
   moral one in the mainstream sense.  "We thought about adding a
   @{"Blue Glue" LINK "jarg_B" 1191} interface but decided it was too evil to deal
   with."  "@{"TECO" LINK "jarg_T" 312} is neat, but it can be pretty evil if you're
   prone to typos."  Often pronounced with the first syllable
   lengthened, as /eeee'vil/.  Compare @{"evil and rude" LINK "jarg_E" 439}.

@{b}evil and rude@{ub} adj.  Both @{"evil" LINK "jarg_E" 426} and @{"rude" LINK "jarg_R" 700}, but with
   the additional connotation that the rudeness was due to malice
   rather than incompetence.  Thus, for example: Microsoft's Windows
   NT is evil because it's a competent implementation of a bad
   design; it's rude because it's gratuitously incompatible with
   Unix in places where compatibility would have been as easy and
   effective to do; but it's evil and rude because the
   incompatibilities are apparently there not to fix design bugs in
   Unix but rather to lock hapless customers and developers into the
   Microsoft way.  Hackish evil and rude is close to the
   mainstream sense of `evil'.

@{b}exa-@{ub} /ek's*/ pref.  [SI] See @{"quantifiers" LINK "jarg_Q" 28}.

@{b}examining the entrails@{ub} n.  The process of @{"grovel" LINK "jarg_G" 803}ling
   through a @{"core dump" LINK "jarg_C" 1156} or hex image in an attempt to discover the
   bug that brought a program or system down.  The reference is to
   divination from the entrails of a sacrified animal.  Compare
   @{"runes" LINK "jarg_R" 710}, @{"incantation" LINK "jarg_I" 142}, @{"black art" LINK "jarg_B" 938}, @{"desk check" LINK "jarg_D" 478}.

@{b}EXCH@{ub} /eks'ch*/ or /eksch/ vt.  To exchange two things,
   each for the other; to swap places.  If you point to two people
   sitting down and say "Exch!", you are asking them to trade
   places.  EXCH, meaning EXCHange, was originally the name of a
   PDP-10 instruction that exchanged the contents of a register and a
   memory location.  Many newer hackers are probably thinking instead
   of the @{"PostScript" LINK "jarg_P" 817} exchange operator (which is usually written
   in lowercase).

@{b}excl@{ub} /eks'kl/ n.  Abbreviation for `exclamation point'.
   See @{"bang" LINK "jarg_B" 202}, @{"shriek" LINK "jarg_S" 719}, @{"ASCII" LINK "jarg_A" 413}.

@{b}EXE@{ub} /eks'ee/ or /eek'see/ or /E-X-E/ n.  An executable
   binary file.  Some operating systems (notably MS-DOS, VMS, and
   TWENEX) use the extension .EXE to mark such files.  This usage is
   also occasionally found among Unix programmers even though Unix
   executables don't have any required suffix.

@{b}exec@{ub} /eg-zek'/ or /eks'ek/ vt., n.  1. [Unix: from
   `execute'] Synonym for @{"chain" LINK "jarg_C" 311}, derives from the
   `exec(2)' call.  2. [from `executive'] obs. The command
   interpreter for an @{"OS" LINK "jarg_O" 304} (see @{"shell" LINK "jarg_S" 666}); term esp. used
   around mainframes, and prob. derived from UNIVAC's archaic EXEC 2
   and EXEC 8 operating systems.  3. At IBM and VM/CMS shops, the
   equivalent of a shell command file (among VM/CMS users).

   The mainstream `exec' as an abbreviation for (human) executive is
   *not* used.  To a hacker, an `exec' is a always a program,
   never a person.

@{b}exercise, left as an@{ub}  [from technical books] Used to
   complete a proof when one doesn't mind a @{"handwave" LINK "jarg_H" 408}, or to avoid
   one entirely.  The complete phrase is: "The proof [or `the rest']
   is left as an exercise for the reader."  This comment *has*
   occasionally been attached to unsolved research problems by authors
   possessed of either an evil sense of humor or a vast faith in the
   capabilities of their audiences.

@{b}external memory@{ub} n.  A memo pad or written notes.  "Hold on
   while I write that to external memory".  The analogy is with store
   or DRAM versus nonvolatile disk storage on computers.

@{b}eye candy@{ub}  i:' kand`ee [from mainstream slang "ear candy"]
   A display of some sort that's presented to @{"luser" LINK "jarg_L" 638}s
   to keep them distracted while the program performs necessary
   background tasks.  "Give 'em some eye candy while the back-end
   @{"slurp" LINK "jarg_S" 918}s that @{"BLOB" LINK "jarg_B" 1100} into core."

@{b}eyeball search@{ub} n.,v.  To look for something in a mass of
   code or data with one's own native optical sensors, as opposed to
   using some sort of pattern matching software like @{"grep" LINK "jarg_G" 704} or any
   other automated search tool.  Also called a @{"vgrep" LINK "jarg_V" 244}; compare
   @{"vdiff" LINK "jarg_V" 194}, @{"desk check" LINK "jarg_D" 478}.

@endnode
@node jarg_F "F"
@{b}face time@{ub} n.  Time spent interacting with somebody
   face-to-face (as opposed to via electronic links).  "Oh, yeah, I
   spent some face time with him at the last Usenix."

@{b}factor@{ub} n.  See @{"coefficient of X" LINK "jarg_C" 653}.

@{b}fall over@{ub} vi.  [IBM] Yet another synonym for @{"crash" LINK "jarg_C" 1306} or
   @{"lose" LINK "jarg_L" 549}.  `Fall over hard' equates to @{"crash and burn" LINK "jarg_C" 1322}.

@{b}fall through@{ub} v.  (n. `fallthrough', var.
   `fall-through') 1. To exit a loop by exhaustion, i.e., by having
   fulfilled its exit condition rather than via a break or exception
   condition that exits from the middle of it.  This usage appears to
   be *really* old, dating from the 1940s and 1950s.  2. To fail
   a test that would have passed control to a subroutine or some other
   distant portion of code.  3. In C, `fall-through' occurs when the
   flow of execution in a switch statement reaches a `case' label
   other than by jumping there from the switch header, passing a point
   where one would normally expect to find a `break'.  A trivial
   example:

     switch (color)
     {
     case GREEN:
        do_green();
        break;
     case PINK:
        do_pink();
        /* FALL THROUGH */
     case RED:
        do_red();
        break;
     default:
        do_blue();
        break;
     }

   The variant spelling `/* FALL THRU */' is also common.

   The effect of the above code is to `do_green()' when color is
   `GREEN', `do_red()' when color is `RED',
   `do_blue()' on any other color other than `PINK', and
   (and this is the important part) `do_pink()' *and then*
   `do_red()' when color is `PINK'.  Fall-through is
   @{"considered harmful" LINK "jarg_C" 961} by some, though there are contexts (such as
   the coding of state machines) in which it is natural; it is
   generally considered good practice to include a comment
   highlighting the fall-through where one would normally expect a
   break.  See also @{"Duff's device" LINK "jarg_D" 1080}.

@{b}fan@{ub} n.  Without qualification, indicates a fan of science
   fiction, especially one who goes to @{"con" LINK "jarg_C" 883}s and tends to hang out
   with other fans.  Many hackers are fans, so this term has been
   imported from fannish slang; however, unlike much fannish slang it
   is recognized by most non-fannish hackers.  Among SF fans the
   plural is correctly `fen', but this usage is not automatic to
   hackers.  "Laura reads the stuff occasionally but isn't really a
   fan."

@{b}fandango on core@{ub} n.  [Unix/C hackers, from the Mexican
   dance] In C, a wild pointer that runs out of bounds, causing a
   @{"core dump" LINK "jarg_C" 1156}, or corrupts the `malloc(3)' @{"arena" LINK "jarg_A" 351} in such
   a way as to cause mysterious failures later on, is sometimes said
   to have `done a fandango on core'.  On low-end personal machines
   without an MMU, this can corrupt the OS itself, causing massive
   lossage.  Other frenetic dances such as the rhumba, cha-cha, or
   watusi, may be substituted.  See @{"aliasing bug" LINK "jarg_A" 193}, 
   @{"precedence lossage" LINK "jarg_P" 855}, @{"smash the stack" LINK "jarg_S" 960}, @{"memory leak" LINK "jarg_M" 448}, 
   @{"memory smash" LINK "jarg_M" 460}, @{"overrun screw" LINK "jarg_O" 383}, @{"core" LINK "jarg_C" 1143}.

@{b}FAQ@{ub} /F-A-Q/ or /fak/ n.  [Usenet] 1. A Frequently Asked
   Question.  2. A compendium of accumulated lore, posted periodically
   to high-volume newsgroups in an attempt to forestall such
   questions.  Some people prefer the term `FAQ list' or `FAQL'
   /fa'kl/, reserving `FAQ' for sense 1.

   This lexicon itself serves as a good example of a collection of one
   kind of lore, although it is far too big for a regular FAQ
   posting.  Examples: "What is the proper type of NULL?"  and
   "What's that funny name for the `#' character?" are both
   Frequently Asked Questions.  Several FAQs refer readers to
   this file.

@{b}FAQ list@{ub} /F-A-Q list/ or /fak list/ n.  [Usenet] Syn
   @{"FAQ" LINK "jarg_F" 71}, sense 2.

@{b}FAQL@{ub} /fa'kl/ n.  Syn. @{"FAQ list" LINK "jarg_F" 84}.

@{b}faradize@{ub} /far'*-di:z/ v.  [US Geological Survey] To start any
   hyper-addictive process or trend, or to continue adding current to
   such a trend.  Telling one user about a new octo-tetris game you
   compiled would be a faradizing act -- in two weeks you might find
   your entire department playing the faradic game.

@{b}farkled@{ub} /far'kld/ adj.  [DeVry Institute of Technology,
   Atlanta] Syn. @{"hosed" LINK "jarg_H" 814}.  Poss. owes something to Yiddish
   `farblondjet' and/or the `Farkle Family' skits on "Rowan
   and Martin's Laugh-In", a popular comedy show of the early 1970s.

@{b}farming@{ub} n.  [Adelaide University, Australia] What the heads
   of a disk drive are said to do when they plow little furrows in the
   magnetic media.  Associated with a @{"crash" LINK "jarg_C" 1306}.  Typically used as
   follows: "Oh no, the machine has just crashed; I hope the hard
   drive hasn't gone @{"farming" LINK "jarg_F" 100} again."

@{b}fascist@{ub} adj.  1. Said of a computer system with excessive or
   annoying security barriers, usage limits, or access policies.  The
   implication is that said policies are preventing hackers from
   getting interesting work done.  The variant `fascistic' seems to
   have been preferred at MIT, poss. by analogy with `touristic'
   (see @{"tourist" LINK "jarg_T" 891}).  2. In the design of languages and other
   software tools, `the fascist alternative' is the most restrictive
   and structured way of capturing a particular function; the
   implication is that this may be desirable in order to simplify the
   implementation or provide tighter error checking.  Compare
   @{"bondage-and-discipline language" LINK "jarg_B" 1444}, although that term is global
   rather than local.

@{b}fat electrons@{ub} n.  Old-time hacker David Cargill's theory on
   the causation of computer glitches.  Your typical electric utility
   draws its line current out of the big generators with a pair of
   coil taps located near the top of the dynamo.  When the normal tap
   brushes get dirty, they take them off line to clean them up, and
   use special auxiliary taps on the *bottom* of the coil.  Now,
   this is a problem, because when they do that they get not ordinary
   or `thin' electrons, but the fat'n'sloppy electrons that are
   heavier and so settle to the bottom of the generator.  These flow
   down ordinary wires just fine, but when they have to turn a sharp
   corner (as in an integrated-circuit via), they're apt to get stuck.
   This is what causes computer glitches.  [Fascinating.  Obviously,
   fat electrons must gain mass by @{"bogon" LINK "jarg_B" 1319} absorption -- ESR]
   Compare @{"bogon" LINK "jarg_B" 1319}, @{"magic smoke" LINK "jarg_M" 138}.

@{b}faulty@{ub} adj.  Non-functional; buggy.  Same denotation as
   @{"bletcherous" LINK "jarg_B" 993}, @{"losing" LINK "jarg_L" 568}, q.v., but the connotation is much
   milder.

@{b}fd leak@{ub} /F-D leek/ n.  A kind of programming bug analogous
   to a @{"core leak" LINK "jarg_C" 1170}, in which a program fails to close file
   descriptors (`fd's) after file operations are completed, and
   thus eventually runs out of them.  See @{"leak" LINK "jarg_L" 114}.

@{b}fear and loathing@{ub} n.  [from Hunter S. Thompson] A state
   inspired by the prospect of dealing with certain real-world systems
   and standards that are totally @{"brain-damaged" LINK "jarg_B" 1633} but ubiquitous
   -- Intel 8086s, or @{"COBOL" LINK "jarg_C" 592}, or @{"EBCDIC" LINK "jarg_E" 36}, or any @{"IBM" LINK "jarg_I" 21}
   machine except the Rios (a.k.a. the RS/6000).  "Ack!  They want
   PCs to be able to talk to the AI machine.  Fear and loathing
   time!"

@{b}feature@{ub} n.  1. A good property or behavior (as of a
   program).  Whether it was intended or not is immaterial.  2. An
   intended property or behavior (as of a program).  Whether it is
   good or not is immaterial (but if bad, it is also a
   @{"misfeature" LINK "jarg_M" 740}).  3. A surprising property or behavior; in
   particular, one that is purposely inconsistent because it works
   better that way -- such an inconsistency is therefore a
   @{"feature" LINK "jarg_F" 151} and not a @{"bug" LINK "jarg_B" 1939}.  This kind of feature is sometimes
   called a @{"miswart" LINK "jarg_M" 768}; see that entry for a classic example.  4. A
   property or behavior that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though
   perhaps also impressive or cute.  For example, one feature of
   Common LISP's `format' function is the ability to print
   numbers in two different Roman-numeral formats (see 
   @{"bells, whistles, and gongs" LINK "jarg_B" 474}).  5. A property or behavior that was 
   put in to help someone else but that happens to be in your way.  6.
   A bug that has been documented.  To call something a feature sometimes
   means the author of the program did not consider the particular
   case, and that the program responded in a way that was unexpected
   but not strictly incorrect.  A standard joke is that a bug can be
   turned into a @{"feature" LINK "jarg_F" 151} simply by documenting it (then
   theoretically no one can complain about it because it's in the
   manual), or even by simply declaring it to be good.  "That's not a
   bug, that's a feature!" is a common catchphrase.  See also
   @{"feetch feetch" LINK "jarg_F" 288}, @{"creeping featurism" LINK "jarg_C" 1402}, @{"wart" LINK "jarg_W" 256}, @{"green lightning" LINK "jarg_G" 679}.

   The relationship among bugs, features, misfeatures, warts, and
   miswarts might be clarified by the following hypothetical exchange
   between two hackers on an airliner:

   A: "This seat doesn't recline."

   B: "That's not a bug, that's a feature.  There is an emergency
   exit door built around the window behind you, and the route has to
   be kept clear."

   A: "Oh.  Then it's a misfeature; they should have increased the
   spacing between rows here."

   B: "Yes.  But if they'd increased spacing in only one section it
   would have been a wart -- they would've had to make
   nonstandard-length ceiling panels to fit over the displaced
   seats."

   A: "A miswart, actually.  If they increased spacing throughout
   they'd lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin.  So
   unequal spacing would actually be the Right Thing."

   B: "Indeed."

   `Undocumented feature' is a common, allegedly humorous euphemism
   for a @{"bug" LINK "jarg_B" 1939}.  There's a related joke that is sometimes referred
   to as the "one-question geek test".  You say to someone "I saw a
   Volkswagen Beetle today with a vanity license plate that read
   FEATURE".  If he/she laughs, he/she is a geek (see @{"computer geek" LINK "jarg_C" 842},
   sense #2).

@{b}feature creature@{ub} n.  [poss. fr. slang `creature feature'
   for a horror movie] 1. One who loves to add features to designs or
   programs, perhaps at the expense of coherence, concision, or
   @{"taste" LINK "jarg_T" 252}.  2. Alternately, a mythical being that induces
   otherwise rational programmers to perpetrate such crocks.  See also
   @{"feeping creaturism" LINK "jarg_F" 280}, @{"creeping featurism" LINK "jarg_C" 1402}.

@{b}feature key@{ub} n.  The Macintosh key with the cloverleaf
   graphic on its keytop; sometimes referred to as `flower',
   `pretzel', `clover', `propeller', `beanie' (an apparent
   reference to the major feature of a propeller beanie), @{"splat" LINK "jarg_S" 1486},
   or the `command key'.  The Mac's equivalent of an @{"alt" LINK "jarg_A" 223} key.
   The proliferation of terms for this creature may illustrate one
   subtle peril of iconic interfaces.

   Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that
   appears on the feature key.  Its oldest name is `cross of St.
   Hannes', but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative
   motif.  Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to
   mark sites of historical interest.  Apple picked up the symbol from
   an early Mac developer who happened to be Swedish.  Apple
   documentation gives the translation "interesting feature"!

   There is some dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this
   symbol.  It technically stands for the word `sev"ardhet'
   (interesting feature) many of these are old churches. Some Swedes
   report as an idiom for it the word `kyrka', cognate to English
   `church' and Scots-dialect `kirk' but pronounced /shir'k*/ in
   modern Swedish.  Others say this is nonsense.  Another idiom
   reported for the sign is `runsten' /roon'stn/, derived from
   the fact that many of the interesting sites are Viking
   rune-stones.

@{b}feature shock@{ub} n.  [from Alvin Toffler's book title
   "Future Shock"] A user's (or programmer's!) confusion when
   confronted with a package that has too many features and poor
   introductory material.

@{b}featurectomy@{ub} /fee`ch*r-ek't*-mee/ n.  The act of removing
   a feature from a program.  Featurectomies come in two flavors, the
   `righteous' and the `reluctant'.  Righteous featurectomies are
   performed because the remover believes the program would be more
   elegant without the feature, or there is already an equivalent and
   better way to achieve the same end.  (Doing so is not quite the
   same thing as removing a @{"misfeature" LINK "jarg_M" 740}.)  Reluctant
   featurectomies are performed to satisfy some external constraint
   such as code size or execution speed.

@{b}feep@{ub} /feep/  1. n. The soft electronic `bell' sound of a
   display terminal (except for a VT-52); a beep (in fact, the
   microcomputer world seems to prefer @{"beep" LINK "jarg_B" 459}).  2. vi. To cause
   the display to make a feep sound.  ASR-33s (the original TTYs) do
   not feep; they have mechanical bells that ring.  Alternate forms:
   @{"beep" LINK "jarg_B" 459}, `bleep', or just about anything suitably onomatopoeic.
   (Jeff MacNelly, in his comic strip "Shoe", uses the word
   `eep' for sounds made by computer terminals and video games; this
   is perhaps the closest written approximation yet.)  The term
   `breedle' was sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal
   bleepers are not particularly soft (they sound more like the
   musical equivalent of a raspberry or Bronx cheer; for a close
   approximation, imagine the sound of a Star Trek communicator's beep
   lasting for five seconds).  The `feeper' on a VT-52 has been
   compared to the sound of a '52 Chevy stripping its gears.  See also
   @{"ding" LINK "jarg_D" 553}.

@{b}feeper@{ub} /fee'pr/ n.  The device in a terminal or
   workstation (usually a loudspeaker of some kind) that makes the
   @{"feep" LINK "jarg_F" 255} sound.

@{b}feeping creature@{ub} n.  [from @{"feeping creaturism" LINK "jarg_F" 280}] An
   unnecessary feature; a bit of @{"chrome" LINK "jarg_C" 489} that, in the speaker's
   judgment, is the camel's nose for a whole horde of new features.

@{b}feeping creaturism@{ub} /fee'ping kree`ch*r-izm/ n.  A
   deliberate spoonerism for @{"creeping featurism" LINK "jarg_C" 1402}, meant to imply
   that the system or program in question has become a misshapen
   creature of hacks.  This term isn't really well defined, but it
   sounds so neat that most hackers have said or heard it.  It is
   probably reinforced by an image of terminals prowling about in the
   dark making their customary noises.

@{b}feetch feetch@{ub} /feech feech/ interj.  If someone tells you
   about some new improvement to a program, you might respond:
   "Feetch, feetch!"  The meaning of this depends critically on
   vocal inflection.  With enthusiasm, it means something like "Boy,
   that's great!  What a great hack!"  Grudgingly or with obvious
   doubt, it means "I don't know; it sounds like just one more
   unnecessary and complicated thing".  With a tone of resignation,
   it means, "Well, I'd rather keep it simple, but I suppose it has
   to be done".

@{b}fence@{ub} n. 1.  A sequence of one or more distinguished
   (@{"out-of-band" LINK "jarg_O" 328}) characters (or other data items), used to
   delimit a piece of data intended to be treated as a unit (the
   computer-science literature calls this a `sentinel').  The NUL
   (ASCII 0000000) character that terminates strings in C is a fence.
   Hex FF is also (though slightly less frequently) used this way.
   See @{"zigamorph" LINK "jarg_Z" 56}.  2. An extra data value inserted in an array or
   other data structure in order to allow some normal test on the
   array's contents also to function as a termination test.  For
   example, a highly optimized routine for finding a value in an array
   might artificially place a copy of the value to be searched for
   after the last slot of the array, thus allowing the main search
   loop to search for the value without having to check at each pass
   whether the end of the array had been reached.  3. [among users of
   optimizing compilers] Any technique, usually exploiting knowledge
   about the compiler, that blocks certain optimizations.  Used when
   explicit mechanisms are not available or are overkill.  Typically a
   hack: "I call a dummy procedure there to force a flush of the
   optimizer's register-coloring info" can be expressed by the
   shorter "That's a fence procedure".

@{b}fencepost error@{ub} n.  1. A problem with the discrete
   equivalent of a boundary condition, often exhibited in programs by
   iterative loops.  From the following problem: "If you build a
   fence 100 feet long with posts 10 feet apart, how many posts do you
   need?"  (Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious 10.)
   For example, suppose you have a long list or array of items, and
   want to process items m through n; how many items are
   there?  The obvious answer is n - m, but that is off by one;
   the right answer is n - m + 1.  A program that used the
   `obvious' formula would have a fencepost error in it.  See also
   @{"zeroth" LINK "jarg_Z" 40} and @{"off-by-one error" LINK "jarg_O" 95}, and note that not all
   off-by-one errors are fencepost errors.  The game of Musical Chairs
   involves a catastrophic off-by-one error where N people try
   to sit in N - 1 chairs, but it's not a fencepost error.
   Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces
   between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether
   one should count one or both ends of a row.  2. [rare] An error
   induced by unexpected regularities in input values, which can (for
   instance) completely thwart a theoretically efficient binary tree
   or hash table implementation.  (The error here involves the
   difference between expected and worst case behaviors of an
   algorithm.)

@{b}fepped out@{ub} /fept owt/ adj.  The Symbolics 3600 LISP
   Machine has a Front-End Processor called a `FEP' (compare sense 2
   of @{"box" LINK "jarg_B" 1571}).  When the main processor gets @{"wedged" LINK "jarg_W" 300}, the FEP
   takes control of the keyboard and screen.  Such a machine is said
   to have `fepped out' or `dropped into the fep'.

@{b}FidoNet@{ub} n.  A worldwide hobbyist network of personal
   computers which exchanges mail, discussion groups, and files.
   Founded in 1984 and originally consisting only of IBM PCs and
   compatibles, FidoNet now includes such diverse machines as Apple
   ][s, Ataris, Amigas, and Unix systems.  Though it is much younger
   than @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190}, FidoNet is already (in early 1991) a significant
   fraction of Usenet's size at some 8000 systems.

@{b}field circus@{ub} n.  [a derogatory pun on `field service'] The
   field service organization of any hardware manufacturer, but
   especially DEC.  There is an entire genre of jokes about DEC field
   circus engineers:

     Q: How can you recognize a DEC field circus engineer
        with a flat tire?
     A: He's changing one tire at a time to see which one is flat.

     Q: How can you recognize a DEC field circus engineer
        who is out of gas?
     A: He's changing one tire at a time to see which one is flat.

   [See @{"Easter egging" LINK "jarg_E" 20} for additional insight on these jokes.]
 
   There is also the `Field Circus Cheer' (from the @{"plan file" LINK "jarg_P" 596} for
   DEC on MIT-AI):

     Maynard! Maynard!
     Don't mess with us!
     We're mean and we're tough!
     If you get us confused
     We'll screw up your stuff.

   (DEC's service HQ is located in Maynard, Massachusetts.)

@{b}field servoid@{ub} [play on `android'] /fee'ld ser'voyd/ n. 
   Representative of a field service organization (see 
   @{"field circus" LINK "jarg_F" 356}).  This has many of the implications of @{"droid" LINK "jarg_D" 997}.

@{b}Fight-o-net@{ub} n.  [FidoNet] Deliberate distortion of @{"FidoNet" LINK "jarg_F" 348},
   often applied after a flurry of @{"flamage" LINK "jarg_F" 594} in a particular
   @{"echo" LINK "jarg_E" 53}, especially the SYSOP echo or Fidonews (see @{"'Snooze" LINK "jarg_alph" 14}).

@{b}File Attach@{ub} [FidoNet]  1. n. A file sent along with a mail
   message from one BBS to another.  2. vt. Sending someone a file by
   using the File Attach option in a BBS mailer.

@{b}File Request@{ub} [FidoNet]  1. n. The @{"FidoNet" LINK "jarg_F" 348} equivalent of
   @{"FTP" LINK "jarg_F" 1285}, in which one BBS system automatically dials another and
   @{"snarf" LINK "jarg_S" 1135}s one or more files.  Often abbreviated `FReq'; files
   are often announced as being "available for FReq" in the same way
   that files are announced as being "available for/by anonymous
   FTP" on the Internet.  2. vt. The act of getting a copy of a file
   by using the File Request option of the BBS mailer.

@{b}file signature@{ub} n.  A @{"magic number" LINK "jarg_M" 109}, sense 3.

@{b}filk@{ub} /filk/ n.,v.  [from SF fandom, where a typo for
   `folk' was adopted as a new word] A popular or folk song with
   lyrics revised or completely new lyrics, intended for humorous
   effect when read, and/or to be sung late at night at SF
   conventions.  There is a flourishing subgenre of these called
   `computer filks', written by hackers and often containing rather
   sophisticated technical humor.  See @{"double bucky" LINK "jarg_D" 830} for an
   example.  Compare @{"grilf" LINK "jarg_G" 714}, @{"hing" LINK "jarg_H" 700} and @{"newsfroup" LINK "jarg_N" 407}.

@{b}film at 11@{ub}  [MIT: in parody of TV newscasters] 1. Used in
   conversation to announce ordinary events, with a sarcastic
   implication that these events are earth-shattering.  "@{"ITS" LINK "jarg_I" 463}
   crashes; film at 11."  "Bug found in scheduler; film at 11."
   2. Also widely used outside MIT to indicate that additional
   information will be available at some future time, *without*
   the implication of anything particularly ordinary about the
   referenced event.  For example, "The mail file server died this
   morning; we found garbage all over the root directory.  Film at
   11." would indicate that a major failure had occurred but that the
   people working on it have no additional information about it as
   yet; use of the phrase in this way suggests gently that the problem
   is liable to be fixed more quickly if the people doing the fixing
   can spend time doing the fixing rather than responding to
   questions, the answers to which will appear on the normal "11:00
   news", if people will just be patient.

@{b}filter@{ub} n.  [orig. @{"Unix" LINK "jarg_U" 54}, now also in @{"MS-DOS" LINK "jarg_M" 1016}] A
   program that processes an input data stream into an output data
   stream in some well-defined way, and does no I/O to anywhere else
   except possibly on error conditions; one designed to be used as a
   stage in a `pipeline' (see @{"plumbing" LINK "jarg_P" 700}).  Compare @{"sponge" LINK "jarg_S" 1534}.

@{b}Finagle's Law@{ub} n.  The generalized or `folk' version of
   @{"Murphy's Law" LINK "jarg_M" 1278}, fully named "Finagle's Law of Dynamic
   Negatives" and usually rendered "Anything that can go wrong,
   will".  One variant favored among hackers is "The perversity of
   the Universe tends towards a maximum" (but see also 
   @{"Hanlon's Razor" LINK "jarg_H" 445}).  The label `Finagle's Law' was popularized by SF 
   author Larry Niven in several stories depicting a frontier culture of
   asteroid miners; this `Belter' culture professed a religion
   and/or running joke involving the worship of the dread god Finagle
   and his mad prophet Murphy.

@{b}fine@{ub} adj.  [WPI] Good, but not good enough to be @{"cuspy" LINK "jarg_C" 1621}.
   The word `fine' is used elsewhere, of course, but without the
   implicit comparison to the higher level implied by @{"cuspy" LINK "jarg_C" 1621}.

@{b}finger@{ub}  [WAITS, via BSD Unix] 1. n. A program that displays
   information about a particular user or all users logged on the
   system, or a remote system.  Typically shows full name, last login
   time, idle time, terminal line, and terminal location (where
   applicable).  May also display a @{"plan file" LINK "jarg_P" 596} left by the user
   (see also @{"Hacking X for Y" LINK "jarg_H" 208}).  2. vt. To apply finger to a
   username.  3. vt. By extension, to check a human's current state by
   any means.  "Foodp?"  "T!"  "OK, finger Lisa and see if she's
   idle."  4. Any picture (composed of ASCII characters) depicting
   `the finger'.  Originally a humorous component of one's plan file
   to deter the curious fingerer (sense 2), it has entered the arsenal
   of some @{"flamer" LINK "jarg_F" 637}s.

@{b}finger trouble@{ub} n.  Mistyping, typos, or generalized keyboard
   incompetence (this is surprisingly common among hackers, given the
   anount of time they spend at keyboards). "I keep putting colons at
   the end of statements instead of semicolons", "Finger-trouble
   again, eh?".

@{b}finger-pointing syndrome@{ub} n.  All-too-frequent result of
   bugs, esp. in new or experimental configurations.  The hardware
   vendor points a finger at the software.  The software vendor points
   a finger at the hardware.  All the poor users get is the finger.

@{b}finn@{ub} v.  [IRC] To pull rank on somebody based on the amount
   of time one has spent on @{"IRC" LINK "jarg_I" 415}.  The term derives from the fact
   that IRC was originally written in Finland in 1987.  There may be
   some influence from the `Finn' character in William Gibson's
   seminal cyberpunk novel "Count Zero", who at one point says to
   another (much younger) character "I have a pair of shoes older
   than you are, so shut up!"

@{b}firebottle@{ub} n.  A large, primitive, power-hungry active
   electrical device, similar in function to a FET but constructed out
   of glass, metal, and vacuum.  Characterized by high cost, low
   density, low reliability, high-temperature operation, and high
   power dissipation.  Sometimes mistakenly called a `tube' in the
   U.S.  or a `valve' in England; another hackish term is
   @{"glassfet" LINK "jarg_G" 307}.

@{b}firefighting@{ub} n.  1. What sysadmins have to do to correct
   sudden operational problems.  An opposite of hacking.  "Been
   hacking your new newsreader?"  "No, a power glitch hosed the
   network and I spent the whole afternoon fighting fires."  2. The
   act of throwing lots of manpower and late nights at a project,
   esp. to get it out before deadline.  See also @{"gang bang" LINK "jarg_G" 28},
   @{"Mongolian Hordes technique" LINK "jarg_M" 897}; however, the term `firefighting'
   connotes that the effort is going into chasing bugs rather than
   adding features.

@{b}firehose syndrome@{ub} n.  In mainstream folklore it is observed
   that trying to drink from a firehose can be a good way to rip your
   lips off.  On computer networks, the absence or failure of flow
   control mechanisms can lead to situations in which the sending
   system sprays a massive flood of packets at an unfortunate
   receiving system, more than it can handle.  Compare @{"overrun" LINK "jarg_O" 369},
   @{"buffer overflow" LINK "jarg_B" 1923}.

@{b}firewall code@{ub} n.  1. The code you put in a system (say, a
   telephone switch) to make sure that the users can't do any
   damage. Since users always want to be able to do everything but
   never want to suffer for any mistakes, the construction of a
   firewall is a question not only of defensive coding but also of
   interface presentation, so that users don't even get curious about
   those corners of a system where they can burn themselves.
   2. Any sanity check inserted to catch a @{"can't happen" LINK "jarg_C" 50} error.
   Wise programmers often change code to fix a bug twice: once to fix
   the bug, and once to insert a firewall which would have arrested
   the bug before it did quite as much damage.

@{b}firewall machine@{ub} n.  A dedicated gateway machine with
   special security precautions on it, used to service outside network
   connections and dial-in lines.  The idea is to protect a cluster of
   more loosely administered machines hidden behind it from
   @{"cracker" LINK "jarg_C" 1253}s.  The typical firewall is an inexpensive micro-based
   Unix box kept clean of critical data, with a bunch of modems and
   public network ports on it but just one carefully watched
   connection back to the rest of the cluster.  The special
   precautions may include threat monitoring, callback, and even a
   complete @{"iron box" LINK "jarg_I" 441} keyable to particular incoming IDs or
   activity patterns.  Syn. @{"flytrap" LINK "jarg_F" 763}, @{"Venus flytrap" LINK "jarg_V" 211}.

@{b}fireworks mode@{ub} n.  The mode a machine is sometimes said to
   be in when it is performing a @{"crash and burn" LINK "jarg_C" 1322} operation.

@{b}firmy@{ub} /fer'mee/  Syn. @{"stiffy" LINK "jarg_S" 1643} (a 3.5-inch floppy
   disk).

@{b}fish@{ub} n.  [Adelaide University, Australia] 1. Another
   @{"metasyntactic variable" LINK "jarg_M" 507}.  See @{"foo" LINK "jarg_F" 825}.  Derived originally
   from the Monty Python skit in the middle of "The Meaning of
   Life" entitled "Find the Fish".  2. A pun for `microfiche'.
   A microfiche file cabinet may be referred to as a `fish tank'.

@{b}FISH queue@{ub} n.  [acronym, by analogy with FIFO (First In,
   First Out)] `First In, Still Here'.  A joking way of pointing out
   that processing of a particular sequence of events or requests has
   stopped dead.  Also `FISH mode' and `FISHnet'; the latter may
   be applied to any network that is running really slowly or
   exhibiting extreme flakiness.

@{b}FITNR@{ub} //  [Thinking Machines, Inc.] Fixed In the Next
   Release.  A written-only notation attached to bug reports.  Often
   wishful thinking.

@{b}fix@{ub} n.,v.  What one does when a problem has been reported
   too many times to be ignored.

@{b}FIXME@{ub} imp.  A standard tag often put in C comments near a
   piece of code that needs work.  The point of doing so is that a
   `grep' or a similar pattern-matching tool can find all such
   places quickly.

     FIXME: note this is common in @{"GNU" LINK "jarg_G" 383} code.

   Compare @{"XXX" LINK "jarg_X" 43}.

@{b}flag@{ub} n.  A variable or quantity that can take on one of two
   values; a bit, particularly one that is used to indicate one of two
   outcomes or is used to control which of two things is to be done.
   "This flag controls whether to clear the screen before printing
   the message."  "The program status word contains several flag
   bits."  Used of humans analogously to @{"bit" LINK "jarg_B" 729}.  See also
   @{"hidden flag" LINK "jarg_H" 664}, @{"mode bit" LINK "jarg_M" 873}.

@{b}flag day@{ub} n.  A software change that is neither forward- nor
   backward-compatible, and which is costly to make and costly to
   reverse.  "Can we install that without causing a flag day for all
   users?"  This term has nothing to do with the use of the word
   @{"flag" LINK "jarg_F" 568} to mean a variable that has two values.  It came into use
   when a massive change was made to the @{"Multics" LINK "jarg_M" 1145} timesharing
   system to convert from the old ASCII code to the new one; this was
   scheduled for Flag Day (a U.S. holiday), June 14, 1966.  See also
   @{"backward combatability" LINK "jarg_B" 90}.

@{b}flaky@{ub} adj.  (var sp. `flakey') Subject to frequent
   @{"lossage" LINK "jarg_L" 580}.  This use is of course related to the common slang
   use of the word to describe a person as eccentric, crazy, or just
   unreliable.  A system that is flaky is working, sort of -- enough
   that you are tempted to try to use it -- but fails frequently
   enough that the odds in favor of finishing what you start are low.
   Commonwealth hackish prefers @{"dodgy" LINK "jarg_D" 722} or @{"wonky" LINK "jarg_W" 639}.

@{b}flamage@{ub} /flay'm*j/ n.  Flaming verbiage, esp. high-noise,
   low-signal postings to @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190} or other electronic @{"fora" LINK "jarg_F" 1021}.
   Often in the phrase `the usual flamage'.  `Flaming' is the act
   itself; `flamage' the content; a `flame' is a single flaming
   message.  See @{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600}, also @{"dahmum" LINK "jarg_D" 39}.

@{b}flame@{ub}  1. vi. To post an email message intended to insult
   and provoke.  2. vi. To speak incessantly and/or rabidly on some
   relatively uninteresting subject or with a patently ridiculous
   attitude.  3. vt. Either of senses 1 or 2, directed with hostility
   at a particular person or people.  4. n. An instance of flaming.
   When a discussion degenerates into useless controversy, one might
   tell the participants "Now you're just flaming" or "Stop all
   that flamage!" to try to get them to cool down (so to speak).

   The term may have been independently invented at several different
   places.  It has been reported from MIT, Carleton College and RPI
   (among many other places) from as far back as 1969.

   It is possible that the hackish sense of `flame' is much older than
   that.  The poet Chaucer was also what passed for a wizard hacker in
   his time; he wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, the most advanced
   computing device of the day.  In Chaucer's "Troilus and
   Cressida", Cressida laments her inability to grasp the proof of a
   particular mathematical theorem; her uncle Pandarus then observes
   that it's called "the fleminge of wrecches."  This phrase seems
   to have been intended in context as "that which puts the wretches
   to flight" but was probably just as ambiguous in Middle English as
   "the flaming of wretches" would be today.  One suspects that
   Chaucer would feel right at home on Usenet.

@{b}flame bait@{ub} n.  A posting intended to trigger a @{"flame war" LINK "jarg_F" 633}, 
   or one that invites flames in reply.  See also @{"troll" LINK "jarg_T" 1070}.

@{b}flame on@{ub} vi.,interj.  1. To begin to @{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600}.  The
   punning reference to Marvel Comics's Human Torch is no longer
   widely recognized.  2. To continue to flame.  See @{"rave" LINK "jarg_R" 122},
   @{"burble" LINK "jarg_B" 2085}.

@{b}flame war@{ub} n.  (var. `flamewar') An acrimonious dispute,
   especially when conducted on a public electronic forum such as
   @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190}.

@{b}flamer@{ub} n.  One who habitually @{"flame" LINK "jarg_F" 600}s.  Said esp. of
   obnoxious @{"Usenet" LINK "jarg_U" 190} personalities.

@{b}flap@{ub} vt.  1. To unload a DECtape (so it goes flap, flap,
   flap...).  Old-time hackers at MIT tell of the days when the
   disk was device 0 and @{"microtape" LINK "jarg_M" 677}s were 1, 2,... and
   attempting to flap device 0 would instead start a motor banging
   inside a cabinet near the disk.  2. By extension, to unload any
   magnetic tape.  See also @{"macrotape" LINK "jarg_M" 70}.  Modern cartridge tapes no
   longer actually flap, but the usage has remained.  (The term could
   well be re-applied to DEC's TK50 cartridge tape drive, a
   spectacularly misengineered contraption which makes a loud flapping
   sound, almost like an old reel-type lawnmower, in one of its many
   tape-eating failure modes.)

@{b}flarp@{ub} /flarp/ n.  [Rutgers University] Yet another
   @{"metasyntactic variable" LINK "jarg_M" 507} (see @{"foo" LINK "jarg_F" 825}).  Among those who use
   it, it is associated with a legend that any program not containing
   the word `flarp' somewhere will not work.  The legend is
   discreetly silent on the reliability of programs which *do*
   contain the magic word.

@{b}flat@{ub} adj.  1. Lacking any complex internal structure.
   "That @{"bitty box" LINK "jarg_B" 924} has only a flat filesystem, not a
   hierarchical one."  The verb form is @{"flatten" LINK "jarg_F" 684}.  2. Said of a
   memory architecture (like that of the VAX or 680x0) that is one big
   linear address space (typically with each possible value of a
   processor register corresponding to a unique core address), as
   opposed to a `segmented' architecture (like that of the 80x86) in
   which addresses are composed from a base-register/offset pair
   (segmented designs are generally considered @{"cretinous" LINK "jarg_C" 1436}).
  
   Note that sense 1 (at least with respect to filesystems) is usually
   used pejoratively, while sense 2 is a @{"Good Thing" LINK "jarg_G" 480}.

@{b}flat-ASCII@{ub} adj.  Said of a text file that contains only
   7-bit ASCII characters and uses only ASCII-standard control
   characters (that is, has no embedded codes specific to a particular
   text formatter markup language, or output device, and no
   @{"meta" LINK "jarg_M" 486}-characters).  Syn. @{"plain-ASCII" LINK "jarg_P" 594}.  Compare
   @{"flat-file" LINK "jarg_F" 679}.

@{b}flat-file@{ub} adj.  A @{"flatten" LINK "jarg_F" 684}ed representation of some
   database or tree or network structure as a single file from which
   the structure could implicitly be rebuilt, esp. one in
   @{"flat-ASCII" LINK "jarg_F" 672} form.  See also @{"sharchive" LINK "jarg_S" 628}.

@{b}flatten@{ub} vt.  To remove structural information, esp. to
   filter something with an implicit tree structure into a simple
   sequence of leaves; also tends to imply mapping to
   @{"flat-ASCII" LINK "jarg_F" 672}.  "This code flattens an expression with
   parentheses into an equivalent @{"canonical" LINK "jarg_C" 89} form."

@{b}flavor@{ub} n.  1. Variety, type, kind.  "DDT commands come in
   two flavors."  "These lights come in two flavors, big red ones
   and small green ones."  See @{"vanilla" LINK "jarg_V" 23}.  2. The attribute that
   causes something to be @{"flavorful" LINK "jarg_F" 707}.  Usually used in the phrase
   "yields additional flavor".  "This convention yields additional
   flavor by allowing one to print text either right-side-up or
   upside-down."  See @{"vanilla" LINK "jarg_V" 23}.  This usage was certainly
   reinforced by the terminology of quantum chromodynamics, in which
   quarks (the constituents of, e.g., protons) come in six flavors
   (up, down, strange, charm, top, bottom) and three colors (red,
   blue, green) -- however, hackish use of `flavor' at MIT predated
   QCD.  3. The term for `class' (in the object-oriented sense) in
   the LISP Machine Flavors system.  Though the Flavors design has
   been superseded (notably by the Common LISP CLOS facility), the
   term `flavor' is still used as a general synonym for `class'
   by some LISP hackers.

@{b}flavorful@{ub} adj.  Full of @{"flavor" LINK "jarg_F" 690} (sense 2); esthetically
   pleasing.  See @{"random" LINK "jarg_R" 26} and @{"losing" LINK "jarg_L" 568} for antonyms.  See also
   the entries for @{"taste" LINK "jarg_T" 252} and @{"elegant" LINK "jarg_E" 108}.

@{b}flippy@{ub} /flip'ee/ n.  A single-sided floppy disk altered
   for double-sided use by addition of a second write-notch, so called
   because it must be flipped over for the second side to be
   accessible.  No longer common.

@{b}flood@{ub} v.  [IRC] To dump large amounts of text onto an
   @{"IRC" LINK "jarg_I" 415} channel.  This is especially rude when the text is
   uninteresting and the other users are trying to carry on a serious
   conversation.
   
@{b}@{u}flowchart@{uu}@{ub} n.  [techspeak] An archaic form of visual
   control-flow specification employing arrows and `speech
   balloons' of various shapes.  Hackers never use flowcharts,
   consider them extremely silly, and associate them with @{"COBOL" LINK "jarg_C" 592}
   programmers, @{"card walloper" LINK "jarg_C" 144}s, and other lower forms of life.
   This attitude follows from the observations that flowcharts (at
   least from a hacker's point of view) are no easier to read than
   code, are less precise, and tend to fall out of sync with the code
   (so that they either obfuscate it rather than explaining it, or
   require extra maintenance effort that doesn't improve the code).
   See also @{"pdl" LINK "jarg_P" 257}, sense 3.

@{b}flower key@{ub} n.  [Mac users] See @{"feature key" LINK "jarg_F" 214}.

@{b}flush@{ub} v.  1. To delete something, usually superfluous, or to
   abort an operation.  "All that nonsense has been flushed."
   2. [Unix/C] To force buffered I/O to disk, as with an
   `fflush(3)' call.  This is *not* an abort or deletion as
   in sense 1, but a demand for early completion!  3. To leave at the
   end of a day's work (as opposed to leaving for a meal).  "I'm
   going to flush now."  "Time to flush."  4. To exclude someone
   from an activity, or to ignore a person.

   `Flush' was standard ITS terminology for aborting an output
   operation; one spoke of the text that would have been printed, but
   was not, as having been flushed.  It is speculated that this term
   arose from a vivid image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing
   down the internal output buffer, washing the characters away before
   they could be printed.  The Unix/C usage, on the other hand, was
   propagated by the `fflush(3)' call in C's standard I/O library
   (though it is reported to have been in use among BLISS programmers
   at DEC and on Honeywell and IBM machines as far back as 1965).
   Unix/C hackers find the ITS usage confusing, and vice versa.

@{b}flypage@{ub} /fli:'payj/ n.  (alt. `fly page') A @{"banner" LINK "jarg_B" 244},
   sense 1.

@{b}Flyspeck 3@{ub} n.  Standard name for any font that is so tiny as
   to be unreadable (by analogy with names like `Helvetica 10' for
   10-point Helvetica).  Legal boilerplate is usually printed in
   Flyspeck 3.

@{b}flytrap@{ub} n.  See @{"firewall machine" LINK "jarg_F" 521}.

@{b}FM@{ub} /F-M/ n.  1. *Not* `Frequency Modulation' but
   rather an abbreviation for `Fucking Manual', the back-formation
   from @{"RTFM" LINK "jarg_R" 639}. Used to refer to the manual itself in the
   @{"RTFM" LINK "jarg_R" 639}.  "Have you seen the Networking FM lately?"
   2. Abbreviation for "Fucking Magic", used in the sense of
   @{"black magic" LINK "jarg_B" 959}.

@{b}fnord@{ub} n.  [from the "Illuminatus Trilogy"] 1. A word
   used in email and news postings to tag utterances as surrealist
   mind-play or humor, esp. in connection with @{"Discordianism" LINK "jarg_D" 617} and
   elaborate conspiracy theories.  "I heard that David Koresh is
   sharing an apartment in Argentina with Hitler. (Fnord.)" "Where
   can I fnord get the Principia Discordia from?"  2. A
   @{"metasyntactic variable" LINK "jarg_M" 507}, commonly used by hackers with ties to
   @{"Discordianism" LINK "jarg_D" 617} or the @{"Church of the SubGenius" LINK "jarg_C" 500}.

@{b}FOAF@{ub} // n.  [Usenet] Acronym for `Friend Of A Friend'.
   The source of an unverified, possibly untrue story.  This term was
   not originated by hackers (it is used in Jan Brunvand's books on
   urban folklore), but is much better recognized on Usenet and
   elsewhere than in mainstream English.

@{b}FOD@{ub} /fod/ v.  [Abbreviation for `Finger of Death',
   originally a spell-name from fantasy gaming] To terminate with
   extreme prejudice and with no regard for other people.  From
   @{"MUD" LINK "jarg_M" 1065}s where the wizard command `FOD <player>' results in the
   immediate and total death of <player>, usually as punishment for
   obnoxious behavior.  This usage migrated to other circumstances,
   such as "I'm going to fod the process that is burning all the
   cycles."  Compare @{"gun" LINK "jarg_G" 839}.

   In aviation, FOD means Foreign Object Damage, e.g., what happens
   when a jet engine sucks up a rock on the runway or a bird in
   flight.  Finger of Death is a distressingly apt description of
   what this generally does to the engine.

@{b}fold case@{ub} v.  See @{"smash case" LINK "jarg_S" 955}.  This term tends to be
   used more by people who don't mind that their tools smash case.  It
   also connotes that case is ignored but case distinctions in data
   processed by the tool in question aren't destroyed.

@{b}followup@{ub} n.  On Usenet, a @{"posting" LINK "jarg_P" 803} generated in response
   to another posting (as opposed to a @{"reply" LINK "jarg_R" 411}, which goes by email
   rather than being broadcast).  Followups include the ID of the
   @{"parent message" LINK "jarg_P" 50} in their headers; smart news-readers can use
   this information to present Usenet news in `conversation'
   sequence rather than order-of-arrival.  See @{"thread" LINK "jarg_T" 583}.

@{b}fontology@{ub} n.  [XEROX PARC] The body of knowledge dealing
   with the construction and use of new fonts (e.g., for window
   systems and typesetting software).  It has been said that fontology
   recapitulates file-ogeny.

   [Unfortunately, this reference to the embryological dictum that
   "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny" is not merely a joke.  On the
   Macintosh, for example, System 7 has to go through contortions to
   compensate for an earlier design error that created a whole
   different set of abstractions for fonts parallel to `files' and
   `folders' -- ESR]

@{b}foo@{ub} /foo/  1. interj. Term of disgust.  2. Used very
   generally as a sample name for absolutely anything, esp. programs
   and files (esp. scratch files).  3. First on the standard list
