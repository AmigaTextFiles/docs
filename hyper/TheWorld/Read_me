@node SEARCH "Search"

Press the button named SEARCH. You may now enter the desired @{"keyword(s)" LINK KEYWORD} and 
either press the enter key, or click on the SEARCH button.

If any matches are found, then the number of records that matched the 
selection criteria (the number of "Hits") is displayed. If you desire to 
view the record titles, then click on the "View" button. If there are many 
matches, you may wish to go back and add more keywords in order to reduce 
the number of matches to a more manageable number.
@endnode
@node KEYWORD "Keyword"

A Keyword is an alphanumeric string of characters, at least three characters
long. Singel digit numbers ar also valid keywords.

The following characters are valid in a keyword:
0-9 a-z -./_

You can "AND" keywords by putting a space between them:
Swedish Finnish   - This will only match records containing both keywords.

You can "OR" keywords by putting the vertical bar (|) character between
them:
Swedish|Finnish   - This will match records containing EITHER Swedish or
		    Finnish.


Wildcards are used to match more than one keyword.

You specify a wildcard keyword by placing an asterisk (*) at the end of the
keyword.

The wildcard string "Swed*" will match Swedish, Sweden and all other words
beginning with Swed.

The wild card character can only be used at the end of a keyword, and there 
must be at least two characters prior to the wildcard.
