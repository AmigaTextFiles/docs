Nature and climate: Cold winters and hot summers. Mostly rugged mountains;
   plains in north and southwest.
Natural resources: Natural gas, petroleum, coal, copper, tlac, barites,
   sulphur, lead, zink, iron ore, salt, precious and semiprecious stones.
People: Pasthun 38%, Tajik 25%, Uzbek 6%, Hazara 19% and minor ethnic
   groups.
Independence: 19 August 1919 from UK
History: Conquered in the 4th century BC by Alexander the Great, Afghanistan
   fell under Arab domination in the 7th century AD, before being conquered
   by th Mongols under Genghis Khan. Part of the Indian Mogul empire, it
   became independent in the mid-18th century, and in the 19th and early
   20th century was the focal point for conflicting Russian and British
   interests on the Northwest Frontier, the British fighting three wars
   against the Afghans between 1839 and 1919. A constitutional monarchy
   since 1930, Afghanistan became progressively politically unstable in the
   1970s and was invaded by the Russians in December 1979.

People: Albanian 90%, Greeks 8%, other 2%.
Independence: 28 November 1912 from Ottoman Empire
History: Although Albania was part of the Byzantine empire from the 6th
   century and a part of the Turkish from the 15th century, its mountain
   tribes always remained fiercely independent and central rule was never
   completely effective. It became an independent State as a result of the
   Balkan Wars in 1912, and after a breif period as a republic became a
   rather unstable monarchy under King Zog in 1928. Invaded by Italy in 1939
   it became a Communist State under Enver Hoxha after the Second World War,
   and although first under the influence of the USSR and later under that
   of China, has generally remained isolationist in policy and outlook.

   European rule in the rest o South America. After a period of semi-
   dictatorial rule, the country emerged as a democratic republic in the
   mid-19th century, but has since had recurrent problems with political
   stability, periodically falling under military rule, most notably at the
   time of Juan Peron. In 1982 th Argentinian claim to the Falkland Islands
   led to an unsuccessful war with Britain.

Independence: 5 July 1962 from France
History: Algeria came under nominal Turkish rule in the 16th century, but
   the native peoples always retained a high degree of independence,
   dominating the Barbary coast until colonized by France in the mid-19th
   century. Heavily settled by French immigrants, Algeria was closely
   integrated with metropolitan France, but the refusal of the European
   settlers to grant equal rights to the native population led to increasing
   political instability and civil war in the 1950s, and in 1962 the country
   was granted independence as a result of a referendum.

History: Egypt's history spans 5,000 years, dating back to the neolithic
   period when nomadic hunters settled in the Nile valley. The ancient
   kingdomes of Upper and Lower Egypt became united, according to tradition,
   under Menes founder of the first of the 31 dynasties which successively
   ruled ancient Egypt. The period of the Old Kingdom, the 'Pyramid Age',
   was characterized by strong central government, with the political and
   religious centre at Memphis. The Middle Kingdom is considered to be the
   classical age of ancient Egyptian culture; its collapse was brought about
   by infiltration of Asiatics, culminating in the in the Hyksos usurpation.
   The New Kingdom, the 'empire' period, with its capital at Thebes, begins
   with the explusion of the Hyksos. Egyptian claims in Syria and Palestine
   became definitive and involved direct confrontation with her principal
   rivals, Mitanni and the Hittites; Nubia was administrated directly from
   Egypt. These foreign interests brought Egypt considerable wealth as well
   as technological and cultural innovations, but by the end of the period a
   decline in the power of the pharaohs and an increase in that of the
   priests redulted in a weakening of the central government. Egypt fell
   successively to Libyans, Ethiopians, Assyrians, and Persians, and
   indigenousrule was finally ended by Alexander the Great, who took Egypt
   in 332 BC. From then until AD 1922 someone other than the Egyptians ruled
   Egypt.
    On Alexander's death the Macedonian Ptolemy I acquired Egypt, and for
   three centuries the country was the centre of Hellenistic culture because
   of the considarable role played by Alexandria, home of a cosmopolitan
   Greekspeaking population who cultivated the arts and sciences, until on
   the death of Cleopatra it became a Roman province. After the Arab
   conquest in 642 Egypt was an Islamic country. From 1517 it formed part of
   the Ottoman empire except for a brief period (1798-1801) under French
   rule following Napoleon's invasion. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869
   made Egypt strategically important, and when the Turks became allies of
   Germany in the First World War the British (who had installed themselves
   following an Egyptian nationalist revolt in 1882) declared the country a
   British protectorate. Independence was granted in 1922 and a kingdom was
   established, becoming a republic after the overthrow of the monarchy in
   1953.

Independence: 1 January 1804 from France.
History: In 1492 Columbus discovered the island that now comprises Haiti 
   and the Dominican Republic, and named it La Isla Espanola (the Spanish 
   Island). The native inhabitants were quickly enslaved or killed by the 
   Spaniards, who established some not very successful settlements at the 
   east end of the island, while French pirates were more successful in 
   establishing plantations in the west. In 1697 the eastern area was ceded 
   to the French, who introduced large number of slaves from West Africa to 
   work in the sugar-plantations. In 1791 the slaves rose in rebellion; 
   they swept to victory under Black leaders such as Toussaint L'Ouverture 
   and in 1804 the colony was proclaimed an independent State, under the 
   name of Haiti, the first country in the Americas (after the USA) to 
   achieve freedom from colonial rule.

Independence: 15 August 1947 from UK.
History: Its history began in the 3rd millennium BC, when the Indus valley
   was the site of a fully developed civilization. This collapsed 1760 BC
   when the invading Aryans spread from west through the northern part of
   the country. Consolidated first within the Buddhist empire of Asoka and
   then the Hindu empire of the Gupta dynasty, much of India was united
   under a Muslim sultanate based on Delhi from the 12th century until
   incorporated in the Mogul empire by Babur and Akbar the Great in the 16th
   century. The decline of Mogul power in the late 17th and early 18th
   century coincided with incteasing European penetration, with Britain
   eventually triumphing over her colonial rivals. British interest had
   begun in the 17th century with the formation of the East India Company,
   whichin 1765 acquired the right to administer Bengal and afterwards other
   parts; in 1858, after the Indian Mutiny, the Crown took over the
   Company's authority, and in 1877 Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of
   India. Rising nationalism, with Mahatma Gandhi a notable leader, resulted
   in independence and partition in 1947, but the new States of India and
   Pakistan did not prove good neighbours, going to war several times over
   the disputed territory of Kashmir and the Pakistani enclave (now
   Bangladesh) in the north-east.

Natural resources: Zinc, lead, natural gas, petroleum, barite, copper,
   gypsum, limestone, dolomite, peat, silver.
People: Celtic and English.
Independence: 6 December 1921.
History: Settled by the Celts, the country became divided into independent 
   tribal territories over which the lords of Tara exercised nominal 
   suzerainty. Christianity reached Ireland, probobly by the 4th century, 
   to be consolidated by the work of St Patrick, and after the break-up of 
   the Roman Empire the country became for a time a leading cultural centre, 
   with the monasteries fostering learning and missionary work. English 
   invasions began in the 12th century under Henry II, but the authority 
   that he established was never secure and by the 16th century was confined 
   to an area round Dublin (the English Pale) until the Tudors succeeded in 
   extending it over the whole of the island. Revolts against English rule, 
   and against the imposition of Protestantism (which met with unexpectedly 
   stubborn resistance), resulted in the 'plantation' of Ireland by English 
   (and later Scotish) families on confiscated land in an attempt to 
   anglicize the country and secure its allegiance; in Ulster particularly 
   the descendants of such settlers retained a distinctive identity. After
   an unsuccessful rebellion in 1798, union of Britain and Ireland followed 
   in 1801. In spite of genuine efforts towards its success Ireland sank 
   deeper into destitution. A share of Britain's industrial prosperity 
   reached Protestant Ulster, but the rest of the island found its 
   agricultural produce and assets dropping in value, and at the failure of 
   the potato crop in the 1840s thousands died in the famine, thousands more 
   fled abroad. The Home Rule movement, led by Parnell, failed to achieve its
   aims in the 19th century and implementation of a bill passed in 1910 was
   delayed by the outbreak of the First World War. An Act of 1920 divided 
   Ireland into two parts: Southern Ireland, later recognized as an 
   independent State (called the Irish Free State 1921-37, Eire 1937-49, the 
   Republic of Ireland 1949- ), and Northern Ireland.

History: The centre of the Roman Empire, Italy was dominated by the

   nationalist movement of the mid-19th century, led by Garibaldi and the
   kingdom of Sardinia, the monarch of the later country becoming king of
   Italy in 1861. Italy entered the First World War on the Allied side in
   1915, but after the war the country was taken over by rhe Fascist
   dictator Mussolini; participarion in the Second World War resulted in
   defeat and much devastation. A republic was established by popular vote

History: According to Japanese tradition, the empire was founded in 660 BC
   by the emperator Jimmu, a descendant of the sun goddess. After a long
   period of courtly rule centred on Kyoto, from the 12th century onwards
   the country was dominated by succeeding clans of military warriors. With
   the restoration of direct Imperal rule in 1868 it entered the modernizing
   process, which was accelerated by wars against China (1894-5) and Russia
   (1904-5), but Japan did not become a major world power until the 20th
   century.Its occupation of the Chinese province of Manchuria in 1931 was
   followed by full-scale invasion of China in 1937. In 1936 an alliance was
   formed with Germany and later with Italy. After attacking Pearl Harbor
   (1941) the Japanese invaded Malaya and captured Hong Kong, Manila and
   Singapore. Their advance was halted by a series of US air and naval
   victories in 1942-4, and Japan surrendered in 1945 after the dropping of
   atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki; a constitutional monarchy was
   established in 1947.

History: Conquered successively by the Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths and

   Isabella of Castile at the end of the 15th centuryand emerged under the 
   Hapsburg kings of the 16th century to become the dominant European power. 
   Thereafter it declined, suffering as a result of the War of the Spanish 
   Succession and the Napoleonic War, and losing most of its overseas empire 
   in the early 19th century. Endemic political instability finally resulted 
   in the Spanish Civil War (1936-9) and the establishment of a Fascist 
   dictatorship under Franco. Franco's death in 1975 was followed by the 
   re-establishment of a constitutional monarchy and a pronounced 
   liberalization of the State.

   (1798-1815), the Confederation's neutrality was guaranteed by the other
   European powers. Neutral in both World Wars, Switzerland has emerged as
