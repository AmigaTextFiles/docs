This AmigaGuide file is intended as a reference for all those who wish to
prove to all those sad PC owners how much better the Amiga is than their PC.

It is NOT intended to be biased at all.  As far as I am aware, all the facts
in this file are correct.  As far as I am concerned, there is no point in
trying to convince PC (or Mac, or Archiemedes, or Atari...) owners how much
better the Amiga is by simply slagging them off.  You need to hit them with
hard facts, and that is what I have attempted to do here.

It also gives you some basic information about your Amiga and other
aspects of computing.  There is more to this than proving that
Amigas are best!

If you know that any of the facts contained in
the document are incorrect, please send me a note so that I can correct it
for the next edition.  See @{"  Author  " link author}.

This is a standard AmigaGuide® file, which you can either load by clicking
on the "Start" button, or by loading the file into Multiview or AmigaGuide.

It uses all the standard AmigaGuide functions, such as linking to buttons.
For example, by clicking on the @{"  Operating System  " Link Os} button, you

@node hist "History of the Amiga"
@{b}
History of the Amiga
@{ub}

Commodore was founded in 1954.  Its full name was Commodore Business
Machines, or CBM for short, and its first role was as a typewriter
repair business.

Commodore's first computer was released in 1977, and this was the
Commodore PET.  This was a huge success and riding on the wave of
popularity the world famous C64 was released.  With its groundbreaking
64k of RAM it stormed the market and was the base of all US and UK
games and continued right up until 1989.

In 1982, a group of computer enthusiasts got together to design
what they believed would be the "ultimate" machine.  The three
men responsible for this amazing feat were Jay Minor, Dave Morse
and RJ Mical, all of whom had had computer building experience.
They got backing from three dentists in the US and set up a small
workshop in Silicon Valley, where they built their super machine
under the pretence of being joystick manufacturers.  In fact,
they were so secretive that they gave all of their chips special
code names in case their phones were tapped.  These code names were
their girlfriends' names, and this is where the tradition of Amiga
chips having names comes from.  hence the company took on the name
@{i}Amiga@{ui}, which being spanish for "girl friend" was an appropriate
name.

When they needed an operating system, the company gave the task to a
company called Metacomco who only had experience of writing operating
systems for mainframe computers.  Hence when they saw the power of the
Amiga system they became very excited and gave AmigaDOS the multitasking
power of a mainframe system.

However, the money began to run out, and the business was taken over
by Commodore.  At this stage Commodore did little but fund the three
designers, but nonetheless it was a very important step.

The first Amiga, the A1000, was released in 1985 and excited many
the world over, but due to its £1500 price tag the sales were not
huge.  It was not until the release of the A500 later that year
that the Amiga really took off.

At this time, the IBMs and clones were huge, monochromatic machines
with the amazingly unfriendly MS-DOS and no Windows.  The Amiga,
on the other hand, had 8bit stereo sound, 4,096 colours and a good
user-friendly operating system.  Now it is 1995 and the PC is only
just getting anywhere near the standards of the old A500!

Commodore's main rivals at the time were Atari, but the war between
Amiga and Atari was a short one and it ws one quite clearly won by
the Amiga.  The Amiga was more expensive than the Atari, but it was
always a better machine and in the end it was that that won the
fight.

Commodore continued to develop the Amiga platform to its full
potential, with the release of machines such as the A2000 which
was at the cutting edge of technology.

However, when the CDTV was released, even the Amiga community
were shocked that Commodore had included the old ECS chipset,
which is the same as the old A500's, and that it was not running
Workbench 2.

Subsequently, the machine failed, even though it was the first
ever CD-ROM computer and true multimedia platform.  Commodore
lost faith in Amiga technology and decided to start making PCs.

Commodore therefore started a large, expensive and ambitious
advertising campaign, they built new factories and opened new
workshops.  But although Commodore's PCs were very popular, they
lost a lot of money and with the advent of the 32-bit Motorola
chips, Commodore gave up making PCs to concentrate on the Amiga
platform again.

It is from the failure of the Commodore PCs that Commodore began
the long, winding road into liquidation.  They produced the A4000,
which, although good, was not good enough, and they just managed
to get the A1200 out in time for the Christmas rush.  However,
the management only ordered a few of these machine to be made, and
they sold out from the shops very quickly indeed.  Because of the lack
of supply, Commodore is reckoned to have lost $350,000,000 that year,
and if you have seen a Commodore profit-and-loss graph, it looks
more like the White Cliffs of Dover.

The management were the ones to blame.  All along they had been saying
that there was absolutely no way that they could produce any new
chips.  Then, they refused to make more than 100,000 Amigas for the
Christmas rush.

On April 29th 1994 Commodore and many of its subsidiaries filed for
bankrupcy in the Bahamas.

After that, Amiga owners went through a year of suspense and
waiting.  Finally, almost exactly a year later, on the 21st April
1995, Commodore and its assets were bought by Escom AG of Germany.

It had been a long year for Amiga owners, waiting to find out what
would happen to their favorite machines, and many did not make it
and transfered to other systems, believing the Amiga dead.

However, Escom's buy-out of the Amiga was a godsend - arguably the
best thing that happened to the Amiga in its existence.  Escom
pronounced the Amiga a "superior technology" and set up a
subsidiary company, Amiga Technologies Gmbh, who would be in
control of researching and developing the Amiga.  Escom also said
that they saw the Amiga as the only true multimedia machine and
that they saw the Amiga as the pathway to making Escom a multimedia
company, rather than just a PC company.

The name Commodore was completely separated from the Amiga.
Commodore is now the name used on Escom's high-end Pentium PCs which
are sold to resellers for distribution in places other than the
Escom range of shops.  Incidentally, Escom do intend to sell the Amiga
through their high-street stores as well as distributing them through
the usual channels, i.e. to mail order companies and computer shops,
in order to maximise distribution.

@Node Os "Operating System"
@{b}
Operating System
@{ub}

The Amiga's operating system is far superior to the PC's @{"  Windows  "
Link Windows} and
@{"  MS-DOS  " link Msdos} and I am not just saying this.  The Amiga
uses @{"  Workbench  " link Workbench} and @{"  AmigaDOS  " link Amigados}
which integrates into one thing.

Both systems use Icons, which are small pictures used to represent programs.
But Windows is really only just a menu, whereby you can select a program
that you have had to add to the Program Manager.

Workbench on the other hand uses icons to display the contents of a disk
drive, whether it be data files, programs or tools.  This is far more
powerful because it allows file management to take place directly within
the operating system, as opposed to loading a seperate program to do so.

Underlying Windows is MS-DOS.  This is the basic operating system of the PC,
and it is from here that file operation can be carried out.  However, it
does not integrate with Windows, and Windows programs cannot be loaded
through MS-DOS.

AmigaDOS on the other hand takes a completely different approach.  AmigaDOS
will integrate perfectly happily with Workbench, and Workbench programs can
be loaded from AmigaDOS.

AmigaDOS is also far more flexible that MS-DOS.  For example, you have the
ability to set up @{"  Assigns  " link Assigns} that enable you to create
virtual drives containing the files of your choice.

AmigaDOS is also a ROM based system, i.e. it resides in the computer's
hardware and does not require software to run.  This allows it to be very
fast indeed, far faster than the hard disk based MS-DOS.

The Amiga's operating system is also fully pre-emptive @{"  Multitasking  "
link Multitasking},
unlike the PC's operating system which simulates being multitasking by
quickly flicking backwards and forwards between Applications, thus
overburdening the CPU and causing a vast reduction in speed.
@Endnode
 
@Node Windows "Microsoft Windows"
@{b}
Windows
@{ub}

Windows is the PC's program launcher and operating environment.  It is
basically a series of icons that launch programs.  These icons are not
positioned automatically and have to be added by the user.

It is essentially an environment.  A program that runs "in Windows" is rather
like a program that runs "in Workbemch" in that it has a standard set of gadgets
such as the Close, Minimize and Maximize gadgets.  This is useful on any platform
because it maintains a universal method of control that the user can easily get
to know and use.

Windows runs "on top of" MS-DOS, which means that you waste memory.  Unlike
@{"  AmigaDOS  " link amigados}, which is only there if you want it, Windows is a higher
level than MS-DOS and is always there whether you like it or not.

The disadvantage of this system is that there is absolutely no file handling.
In order to do this you have to load a separate file management program,
which is slow due to the fact that for all operations it has to revert to
@{"  MS-DOS  " link msdos} (although you do not notice it).
@Endnode

@node prices "Price Comparison"
@{b}
Price Comparison
@{ub}

Have you ever calculated the cost of a full Amiga setup to the cost of a full PC setup?
Well, I have done it for you.

@{fg highlight}  Prices are not yet available but Escom have hinted that they would
  like to sell the Amiga 1200 at around £399, compared to £699 for
  their cheapest, bog-standard PC (Non-sale prices).
@{fg text}
Remember that you can run your Amiga through a TV and save buying a monitor to
save even more money.  This is especially true of home users, who may not need a
monitor to play games and Word Process etc., as a monitor, although giving a
clearer display and allowing flicker-free access to all the AGA graphics modes,
is not always necessary.

Also, when you buy an Amiga, you know that it is made and manufactured by a
reputable company.  This is not always true of a PC.  In order to cut costs,
you may go for a less well-known firm, and the computer may not be up to what
you expected.  This is not to say that all PC manufactures are bad, in fact
this would be a gross malignment to say this.  My advice to perspective PC
buyers is always to pay that little bit more and go for a reputable firm
who you know are going to have good after-sales support etc. (and lets face
it, if you buy a new PC you almost always need after-sales support!)
@endnode

@Node Workbench "Amiga Workbench"
@{b}
Workbench
@{ub}

The Amiga's Workbench is the @{"  Graphical User Interface  " link GUI}
that is used in conjunction with @{"  AmigaDOS  " link Amigados} to form
the Amiga's powerful @{"  Operating System  " link os}

It is based around the Unix operating sytem, which is widely believed to
be the most powerful OS around.

Workbench is based around a drag-and-drop and mouse/point/click @{"  GUI  " link gui}.
This is very powerful and very user-friendly, because you can, for example,
double-click on a picture file and it will load your paint program with
that picture in the edit area.

Another powerful feature of Workbench is Datatypes.  This is a system
whereby any program with datatype support can load or save in any file
format that you have a datatype for.  For example, if, in your datatypes
draw, you have a PCX datatype, then you could load or save pictures in your
datatype-supporting paint program in PCX format.

Workbench/AmigaDOS do not require software drivers for additional
devices.  The Amiga does have what it calls "DOSDrivers", but these
are only settings files which the computer refers to and are not
required to be loaded into memory as on the PC, thus saving valuable
memory and hard-disk space.

@{fg highlight}
Features of Workbench include:

   *  Full pre-emptive multitasking

   *  Complete integration with AmigaDOS

   *  Extreme user friendliness

   *  The ability to control files and programs from the GUI

   *  The configurability of the system

   *  Datatypes

   *  Requires one eigth of the resources required by Windows

   *  The ability to have multiple screens open at once

   *  The ease of upgradability @{fg text}
@endnode

@node Amigados "AmigaDOS"
@{b}
AmigaDOS
@{ub}

AmigaDOS is the base of the Amiga's @{"  Operating System  " link os}.
It is a very powerful, text based system that can do anything from launching
@{"  Workbench  " link Workbench} programs to directing your printer output
to disk or managing your files.

AmigaDOS integrates fully with Workbench and therefore when you shell to
AmigaDOS you are not "dropping down" into DOS as you are on the PC, as
AmigaDOS and Workbench are all on one level.
@endnode

@node Assigns "Assigns"
@{b}
Assigns
@{ub}

Assigns are like "virtual" disk drives.  For example, you could create a
virtual drive called "PICS:" to contain all of your pictures.  You can then
tell the computer where on your disk your pictures are (they can be in as
many places as you like) so that when you want to use a picture in, for
example, your Desktop Publisher, you can tell the computer to go to the disk
drive called "PICS:", and you then get a list of all of your pictures.

Assigns are also particularly useful for re-routing programs from one place
to another, and for making software which is not supplied with a hard disk
install to work from hard disk.
@endnode

@node msdos "MS-DOS"
@{b}
MS-DOS
@{ub}

MS-DOS is the PC's DOS, rather like @{"  AmigaDOS  " link amigados} but far
less powerful.  MS-DOS runs separately from Windows, at a lower "level", and
controls all of the file operations made by the computer.  It does not
integrate with Windows, and does not multitask at all.

MS-DOS is a disk based system, which slows it down considerably.
@endnode

@node GUI "Graphical User Interface (GUI)"
@{b}
Graphical User Interface
@{ub}

A graphical user interface is a system by which a computer can be controlled
graphically, usually using icons and a pointing device.

The Amiga's GUI is @{"  Workbench  " link workbench}, whilst the PC's is
@{"  Windows  "link Windows}.
@endnode

@node Multitasking "Multitasking"
@{b}
Multitasking
@{ub}

Multitasking is the ability of a computer to do more than one thing at once.
The Amiga uses a system called pre-emptive multitasking which allows it to
'multithread', i.e. perform one task whilst another is still going on in the
background. The PC uses a system called 'timesiting' which envolves the OS
switching between the two tasks very quickly.  This inevitably leads to a
loss of speed and available processor power.
@endnode

@node Graphsoft "Graphics Software"
@{b}
Graphics Software
@{ub}

There is a multitude of graphics software available on the Amiga, as it is
really a graphics workstation.

Titles such as Deluxe Paint 5, Photogenics and Brilliance 2 allow you to
create pictures in up to 16.8 million colours (24-bit graphics) and animate
in the same number of colours (memory permitting, of course).

TV Paint, as its name suggests, is used by many TV comapanies to produce
graphics for Television.

Titles such as ImageFX 2, Digital Illusions and Art Department Pro allow you
to image process your pictures, creating all sorts of effects.  Some of
these programs even have direct scanning support to allow you to scan
straight into the program using either a flatbed or a handheld scanner.

ImageFX 2's main rival is Photoshop on the Apple Macintosh®, but up until
recently Photoshop has been the better package.  However, a new version
has just been released and it is said to have more features than Photoshop,
and as usual on the Amiga, it costs a fraction of the price.

Lightwave and Imagine are examples of software that allow you to render and
to do animations of rendered graphics.  Lightwave in particular is used by
film compaines to produce the special effects in @{"  Films  " link films}.

@{"  Graphics  " link graphics}

@node Sound "Sound"
@{b}
Sound
@{ub}

All Amigas come with sound as standard.  The A500, A500+, A600 and A1200 all
have 8-bit, 4-channel sound, whereas the A4000 has 16-bit sound.

All of these can be upgraded using modules such as the Aura or Clarity 16 to
give improved sound accross the board at very low cost.

The basic PC, on the other hand, has a small internal speaker (capable of
little more than the average error beep) to its name.  However, if you are
willing to pay the price of a brand new A1200, you can upgrade to a 32-bit
sound card for your PC.  But the sound card then requires drivers and
devices to control it which fill up the PC's tiny 640K @{"  MS-DOS  "
link msdos} conventional memory limit.

@node cdromsoft "CD-ROM Software"
@{b}
CD-ROM Software
@{ub}

At present the PC has more CD-ROM software than the Amiga.  This is because
the PC has a large CD-ROM userbase, whereas the CD32 has only just been
released and the number of A1200 CD-ROM drive owners, although increasing,
is small.  However, this does not mean that there is no software for the
Amiga CD-ROM.  There is, of course, all the CDTV software, and all the
CD32 games that are available.

As well as these, there are lots of Multimedia CDs for use with programs
such as Lightwave, Imagine, Desktop Publishers, Art programs and even AMOS.

The PC has loads of CD-ROM software.  The downpoint is that if you buy a PC
CD-ROM, you have to install at least some of the files from the program onto
your hard disk.  Why?  Who knows.

Another point is that, as with 99% of PC peripherals, you need a CD-ROM
driver to make it work.  And this has to be made not to conflict with the
sound card or graphics or anything else you may have added.  Furthermore,
you have to make sure that you do not use up your valuable 640k memory limit
that you have when running @{"  MS-DOS  " link msdos}.
@endnode


@node soundsoft "Sound Software"
@{b}
Sound Software
@{ub}

There is plenty of sound sotware on the Amiga:  OctaMED, Bars and Pipes Pro;
Deluxe music 2; Quadra Pro; etc.  Deluxe Music Construction Set 2 is also
one of a kind, allowing the composer to simply place appropriate notes on
a score, and set it up as one would when composing a standard score.

But how much does this cost?  Well, actually it costs absolutely nothing.
OctaMED and Quadra Pro are available through any good @{"  PD  " link pdsoft}
library.

The music that you hear when you start this program is a standard computer
"mod", or "module", which wass written in one of the aforementioned
programs.

The PC also has a small amount of sound software but seeing as the PC does
not have sound as standard (other than an annoying beep) there is not really
an incentive for companies to produce audio software for the PC.  And
surprise surprise, it's expensive too.

Programs like Bars & Pipes Pro show that there are things that can only be
done on the Amiga, other than @{"  Graphics  "link graphics}.

@node sersoft "Serious Software"
@{b}
Serious Software
@{ub}

This is one area where the PC is ahead of the Amiga.  It is not the quality
of the software on the PC that is better, but the choice.

For example, Wordworth 3.1 on the Amiga is a good match for Word for
Windows 6 on the PC.  In fact, it has more functions than Word for Windows 6;
and it is certainly better than all the other PC wordprocessors available.
However, on the Amiga you really do not have much choice. If you
want a good WP then you can really choose between Final Writer and
Wordworth, which although both very good, does not leave you with much
choice.

The PC on the other hand has far more choice. However, some of this is
created by the fact that people who do not run Windows cannot run most of
the good WP's, and so a whole new market is opened up in the way of DOS
based WP's.

At desktop publishing, the two are about equal.  The Amiga has got
Pagestream 3.1, for example, at the high end of the market, whilst the
PC has its own titles.  Microsoft Publisher® is a very good low end
desktop publisher for the PC, but it does not come close to Quark
Express® on the Mac® (used for most magazine and newspaper design) or
its main rival, the aforementioned Pagestream 3.1 on the Amiga.

It cannot be denied that the PC has got better spreadsheet programs than
the Amiga. However, Softwood are producing their "Final Calc" spreadsheet
which is said to be able to carry out functions that a spreadsheet has
never previously been able to be do.  What exactly these functions are,
and how useful they will be to the average user, remains to be seen.

So all in all the only thing that the PC has over the Amiga here is choice.
The quality of the software is in most cases no different, and the Amiga's
software is usually around half the price.  Word for Windows can be picked
up for aroud £250, whilst Wordworth 3.1 is available for £80 {Digita's
price as of May 1995)!

@node gamesoft "Games software"
@{b}
Games Software
@{ub}

Ok, so the PC has got "Doom."  But we have got "Alien Breed 3D" and others
which are just as good, and allow you to play two player head-to-head,
which Doom won't do.

Apart from the "first-person perspective" games, look at games like Super
Stardust, Canon Fodder, Lost Eden, TFX, Megarace, Tower Assault, Bloodnet...
the list goes on and on and on.  All these games are better on the Amiga
than on any other platform, particularly the PC which, in general, uses sad
VGA graphics due to the fact that Super VGA takes up huge amounts of memory,
which the average user does not have.  The Amiga however usually uses Hi-Res
graphics, which, as its name suggests, is higher resolution.

In general, though, the Amiga is far superior games wise.  With its
advanced @{"  Graphics  "link } chipset, the Amiga is particularly good
at scrolling games as well as 3D and other games.  Note that the CD32 is
particularly good at 3D graphics due to its Akiko chip.

After all, what computer was it that classics like "Lemmings", "Monkey
Island", "Cannon Fodder", "Sensible Soccer", "Sensible World of Soccer",
"Settlers" and many, many more came out on first?  Yes, it was the Amiga.

However, in general most games will come out on all platforms, although the
graphics in many Amiga games are noticably better than the PC version.

The Amiga is a long way ahead when it comes to graphics.  There is nothing
on the PC to allow you to do animation for below £100, in fact I have never
come across a piece of software to do animation at all on the PC, whatever
the price (being unfortunate enough to own one myself)

There is a program called Autodesk on the PC which allows you to do
rendering, but the slight disadvantage is that it costs £2500!  You can
get a version of Imagine on the PC, but it does not have the features or
capabilities of the Amiga version.  Lightwave, on the other hand,
costs £300 and has been used to create films such as the new
"Star Trek" film and many shows such as "Babylon 5" and "Seaquest DSV."
It is used extensively by American TV networks and also by "Meridian
Television" (the South East of England's local TV station) to create
graphics.

Deluxe Paint 5 is the perfect system for artists of all levels of ability,
which allows you to animate, create easy perspective images and has effects
such as light table and rub through.  Not to mention programs such as
Photogenics, Brilliance 2,  Art Department Professional.

Image processors on the PC however is just a no-go area.  I have never seen
one and if anyone ever has please send me some details such as price and
functions so that I can include this in a future version.

The Amiga has the advantage of being able to be plugged straight into a
television or video recorder.  This is very useful for recording animations,
 titling videos or genlocking.  To plug a PC into a TV is very expensive
and the quality is not all that good.

All of the above can be done without having to improve your hardware or buy
a graphics card at all.  However, it is possible to buy 64-bit graphics
cards or the amazing "Video Toaster" which is used extensively by
television comapanies and professional graphics companies.

Screen resolutions on the Amiga without extra cards can be as high as 30,000
x 30,000 using Lightwave, and 1,024 x 1,024 in Workbench.  Using a video
card Workbench can be in a screen mode of up to about 4000 x 4000.

The highest screen resolution on the PC is Super VGA, 800 x 600, or you can
change this to be higher in one direction but lower in the other.  However,
SVGA is so memory-guzzling that it is hardly worth using in games,
although Windows uses it which is one of the factors that makes it
even slower.

Television/Video
@{ub}

It is very easy to connect your Amiga to a television.  In fact, this is
how most users do view the ouptut from their Amiga.  This is due to the
fact that the A1200 has a built in TV modulator, and the A500 comes with
one. It also has an RGB port (Red, Green and blue) which is for a monitor.
It is also possible to use both at once.

It is very difficult and very expensive to connect a PC to a television,
and the quality is quite low.

The ease with which you can plug your Amiga into a TV opens up a whole new
range of possibilities: video titling; digitising; recording animations to
video; etc.

   *  Numerous American Network TV shows

   *  Cyberjack

   *  Quantum Leap

   *  Batman Forever

These are just a few of the films produced with the Amiga. Most
are made with Lightwave and the Video Toaster from NewTec.

Full price software on the Amiga is often far cheaper than on the PC; for
example Word for Windows 6 costs £250, whilst Final Writer 3 costs £70 and
is just as good.

Games are also cheaper, although some prices are beginning to rise slowly.

As for graphics software, Autodesk on the PC costs £2,500 whilst Imagine 3
costs £250!

Public Domain
@{ub}
Public domain software is absolutely free.  It is written by the author for

program/because there is not a commercial program.

It can be obtained through PD libraries, where you may pay a little for the
price of the disk and the management of the library.  Normal costs are
around £0.99 per disk.

PD can also be downloaded using a modem.

PD can be distributed as much as you like but the source code usually
remains the copyright of the author.

This program is an example of PD - it costs nothing and may be distributed
freely..

PD is only very rarely found on the PC but it thrives on the Amiga.

Expandability
@{ub}

Both computers are very expandable.  They both have Zorro type slots which
can have practically anything plugged into them.

Even the A1200, in a keyboard case, is very expandable.  It has only one
Zorro type slot, which is underneath, but also has one PCMCIA card slot
which will allow almost anything to be put in it, from a SCSI controller
to a CD-ROM drive to a hard disk to extra RAM.  It also has a built in
IDE controller.

The PC has a built in IDE controller and a number of Zorro slots.
However, one of these is filled by the video card, and another by the
multiport controller card (which looks after the serial and parallel ports).
Then another is used up if you wantto have any sound, not leaving
you with very many to spare.

Communications
@{ub}

Thanks to the wonderful RS232c, any modem can be used on either the Amiga
or the PC. However, if you have a PC you then have to ensure that you have
a serial card that is fast enough to support your modem, otherwise you will
get data loss.  Typical, more upgrading/fiddling with IRQ's etc. etc.!

On the Amiga you can plug in any modem to the serial port or through the
PCMCIA port and off it goes at whatever speed the modem goes up to.

So, the hardware is the same, but what is the software like?  Well, the
best Amiga software to use with your modem is @{"  PD  "link pdsoft}, i.e.
you don't even have to pay a penny for it.  And what is more, it is
excellent.  It is very fast and allowsyou to carry out any functions that
you would expect from a your terminal software, including phonebook,
autodial, off-line editing etc.

On the PC, though, you have to buy your software to run your modem.  There
is a terminal addition to @{"  Windows  " link windows} but it is not very
good and does not really have a huge list of functions.

The Internet
@{ub}

Well, we couldn't go without mentioning the latest buzzword in computing,
could we?  I shall try not to use particular phrases linking people who stand on
specially shaped boards whilst in the middle of the ocean with the latest computing
trend.

What is the Internet?  Well, the internet is a way of sending information between
one computer and another, via a special bulletin board system, down the telephone line.

Whether it is a text file, like a letter, which you are sending to another person,
(known as E-mail), or receiving files from the bulletin board onto your own computer,
or looking up anything from how to wire a plug to how to make an atomic bomb, the chances
are that you will find it on the Internet.

At a price.

The average fee is around @{fg highlight}£10 a month @{fg text} which you pay to the bulletin board system
to which you subscribe.  They then manage your electronic "postbox" and give
you access to the World Wide Web (or WWW for short).

The WWW is a system combining graphics and text by which you can find information
abnout almost anything you like.  It is among the pages of WWW that you may come
the Amiga Format® home page, or news updates from Escom®, or press releases
from Downing Street.  You name it, it's there.

So now that you all want to go out and buy a modem (if you haven't already got one),
howabout looking at the cheaper alternative to the Internet, @{"  FidoNet  " link fidonet}?

The FidoNet is a cheap alternative to the @{"  Internet  " link internet}.
It does not offer all the services of the Internet, for example the World Wide
Web.  But then the FidoNet is @{fg highlight} absolutely free!@{fg text}  It is
run simply by bulletin board controllers who have special "gateways" allowing
them to send files to each other.

You can still E-mail people, although it may take about a day to get to the person,
and you can still upload and download files.  In fact, if you are looking for a piece
of info, the easy way find out the answer is to leave a public message that anyone can
read and answer.  There is bound to be someone who can tell you what you want to know!

Networking
@{ub}

It is possible to network both the PC and the Amiga.  Both can use a system
called Ethernet which envolves adding a card to your computer.  Only the
big-box computers can do this, though.  The keyboard case Amigas and most
PC portables won't have the room to fit the card in. However, it is in
general far easier to network PC's, simply because there is the
software to do it, which is easy to use and widely available.  This is
because the PC is used so much in large offices where a network may be
practical.

There is software to network Amigas, but it is very hard to get and not so
easy to use.

The alternative to a full network, of course, is the @{"  Sernet  "link sernet}
and it's brother @{"  Parnet  "link parnet}.  These allow two or more
computers to share each other's files and in the case of the Amiga, the
