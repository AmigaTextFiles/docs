      note:
       70.8% of the world is water, 29.2% is land
     Land boundaries:
       the land boundaries in the world total 250,883.64 km (not counting shared

     Maritime claims:
      contiguous zone:
       24 nm claimed by most but can vary
      continental shelf:
       200 m depth claimed by most or to the depth of exploitation, others claim
       200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin
      exclusive fishing zone:
       200 nm claimed by most but can vary
      exclusive economic zone:
       200 nm claimed by most but can vary
      territorial sea:
       12 nm claimed by most but can vary
      note:
       boundary situations with neighboring states prevent many countries from
       extending their fishing or economic zones to a full 200 nm; 42 nations and
       other areas that are landlocked include Afghanistan, Andorra, Armenia,
       Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Burkina, Burundi,
       Central African Republic, Chad, Czech Republic, Ethiopia, Holy See (Vatican

     Climate:
       two large areas of polar climates separated by two rather narrow temperate
       zones from a wide equatorial band of tropical to subtropical climates

     Natural resources:
       the rapid using up of nonrenewable mineral resources, the depletion of
       forest areas and wetlands, the extinction of animal and plant species, and
       the deterioration in air and water quality (especially in Eastern Europe and
       the former USSR) pose serious long-term problems that governments and
       peoples are only beginning to address

Economy (World)
===============


     Overview:
       Real global output--gross world product (GWP)--rose one-half of 1% in 1992,
       with results varying widely among regions and countries. Average growth of
       1.5% in the GDP of industrialized countries (62% of GWP in 1992) and average
       growth of 5% in the GDP of less developed countries (30% of GWP) were offset
       by a further 15-20% drop in the GDP of the former Soviet-East European area
       (now only 8% of GWP). The United States accounted for 23% of GWP in 1992;
       the 12-member European Community, which established a single internal market
       on 1 January 1993, accounted for another 23%, and Japan accounted for 10%.
       These are the three "economic superpowers" presumably destined to compete
       for mastery in international markets on into the 21st century. In general,
       growth in the industrialized countries was sluggish in 1992, with
       unemployment typically at 7-11%. As for the less developed countries, China,
       India, and the Four Dragons--South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
       Singapore--posted good records; however, many other countries, especially in
       Africa, suffered bitterly from drought, rapid population growth, and civil
       strife. The continued plunge in production in practically all the former
       Warsaw Pact economies strained the political and social fabric of these
       newly independent nations, in particular in Russia. The addition of nearly
       100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating
       the problems of pollution, desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and
       famine. Because of their own internal problems, the industrialized countries
       have inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the
       world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are becoming further
       marginalized. (For the specific economic problems of each country, see the
       individual country entries in this volume.)
     National product:
       GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power equivalent - $25.6 trillion
       (1992 est.)
     National product real growth rate:
       0.5% (1992 est.)
     National product per capita:

      developed countries:
       5% (1992 est.)

       50% (1992 est.)
      note:
       these figures vary widely in individual cases
     Unemployment rate:
       developed countries typically 7-11%; developing countries, extensive
       unemployment and underemployment (1992)

========================


     Electricity:
       2,864,000,000 kW capacity; 11,450,000 million kWh produced, 2,150 kWh per
       capita (1990)
     Industries:
       industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, especially in
       computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical
       equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small
       portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
       technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial
       nations and the less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid
       development of new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating
       already grim environmental problems
     Agriculture:
       the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
       20 years; the annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50%,
       from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons;
       production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
       increases in planted areas; while global production is sufficient for
       aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's population remains
       malnourished, primarily because local production cannot adequately provide
       for large and rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for
       food imports; conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
       recent years has intensified the consequences of overpopulation
