       small and too remote for development of a tourist industry. Government
       revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
       remittances. Substantial income is received annually from an international
       trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, New Zealand, and the UK and
       supported also by Japan and South Korea.
