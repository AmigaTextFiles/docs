Economy (Paraguay)
==================


     Overview:
       Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP, employs
       about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay
       lacks substantial mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
       hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared
       with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual
       rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three of five
       years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose.
       Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
       completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak
       international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy
       experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
       stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery
       continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. In a
       major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in
       March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes
       Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an
       unorthodox approach, reduced external debt with both commercial and official
       creditors by purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt
       in the secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid
       100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France, and
       Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the long run,
       the government must press forward with general, market-oriented economic
       reforms.
