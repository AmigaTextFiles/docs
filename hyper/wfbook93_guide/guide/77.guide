Economy (Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas))
===========================================


     Overview:
       The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or indirectly employs
       most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
       consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily those
       for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to
       the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
       surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,
       efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In
       1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
       operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees
       amount to more than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income
       for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
       Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
       wildlife and trout fishing.
