Economy (Laos)
==============


     Overview:
       One of the world's poorest nations, Laos has had a Communist centrally
       planned economy with government ownership and control of productive
       enterprises of any size. In recent years, however, the government has been
       decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a
       landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure; that is, it has no
       railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and internal
       telecommunications, and electricity available in only a limited area.
       Subsistence agriculture is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of
       GDP and providing about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is
       rice. For the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its
       survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources; aid
       from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.

       226,000 kW capacity; 990 million kWh produced, 220 kWh per capita (1992)
     Industries:

       construction
     Agriculture:
       accounts for 60% of GDP and employs most of the work force; subsistence
       farming predominates; normally self-sufficient in nondrought years;
       principal crops - rice (80% of cultivated land), sweet potatoes, vegetables,
       corn, coffee, sugarcane, cotton; livestock - buffaloes, hogs, cattle,
       poultry
