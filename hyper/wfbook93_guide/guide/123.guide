Economy (Jersey)
================


     Overview:
       The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
       tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are
       important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy
       cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk
       products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector
       overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the
       island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light
       industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry
       has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw
       material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
       Jersey's food needs.
