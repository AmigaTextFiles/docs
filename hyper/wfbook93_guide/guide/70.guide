Economy (Egypt)
===============


     Overview:
       Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
       economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government.
       Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment.
       Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but
       in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
       debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
       balance-of-payments support. Egypt's first IMF standby arrangement concluded
       in mid-1987 was suspended in early 1988 because of the government's failure
       to adopt promised reforms. Egypt signed a follow-on program with the IMF and
       also negotiated a structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In
       1991-92 the government made solid progress on administrative reforms such as
       liberalizing exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major
       structural reforms like streamlining the public sector. As a result, the
       economy has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing
       problem. In 1992-93 tourism has plunged 20% or so because of sporadic
       attacks by Islamic extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited
       population growth as the main cause of the country's economic troubles. The
       addition of about 1.4 million people a year to the already huge population
       of 60 million exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the land area available
       for agriculture.
