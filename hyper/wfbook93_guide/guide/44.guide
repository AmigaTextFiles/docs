Economy (Canada)
================


     Overview:
       As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
       the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic system, and pattern of
       production. Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
       mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
       economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada
       registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,
       averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
       and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. However,
       the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking
       areas has observers discussing a possible split in the confederation; foregn
       investors have become edgy.
