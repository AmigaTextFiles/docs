Economy (Zimbabwe)
==================


     Overview:
       Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and supplies almost 40%
       of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining,
       produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for
       only 5% of both GDP and employment, but supplies of minerals and metals
       account for about 40% of exports. Wide fluctuations in agricultural
       production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven growth rate,
       one that on average has matched the 3% annual increase in population. Helped
       by an IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program, output rose 3.5% in
       1991. A severe drought in 1991/92 caused the economy to contract by about
       10% in 1992.
