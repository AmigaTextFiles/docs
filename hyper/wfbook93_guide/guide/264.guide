     Overview:
       The economy has been in decline for more than a decade with falling imports
       and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stem from a chronically
       depressed level of copper production and ineffective economic policies. In
       1991 real GDP fell by 2% and in 1992 by 3% more. An annual population growth
       of more than 3% has brought a decline in per capita GDP of 50% over the past
       decade. A high inflation rate has also added to Zambia's economic woes in
       recent years, as well as severe drought in the crop year 1991/92.
