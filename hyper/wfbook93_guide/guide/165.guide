Economy (Morocco)
=================


     Overview:
       The economy had recovered moderately in 1990 because of: the resolution of a
       trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales, a rebound in textile
       sales to the EC, lower prices for food imports, a sharp increase in worker
       remittances, increased Arab donor aid, and generous debt rescheduling
       agreements. Economic performance in 1991 was mixed. A record harvest helped
       real GDP advance by 4.2%. Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial
       policies triggered rapid credit and monetary growth. Despite recovery of
       domestic demand, import volume growth slowed while export volume was
       adversely affected by phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992,
       Morocco reached a new 12-month standby arrangement for $129 million with the
       IMF. In February 1992, the Paris Club rescheduled $1.4 billion of Morocco's
       commercial debt. This is thought to be Morocco's last rescheduling. By 1993
       the Moroccan authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service
       obligations without additional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high
       unemployment, and Morocco's vulnerability to external economic forces remain
       severe long-term problems. In 1992 Morocco embarked on a program to
       privatize 112 state-owned companies. A severe winter drought in 1991/92 cut
       back agricultural output in 1992.
