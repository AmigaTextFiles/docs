Economy (Sierra Leone)
======================


     Overview:
       The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed. Subsistence
       agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and
       employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which
       accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw
       materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
       provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from high
       unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing
       dependency on foreign assistance. The government in 1990 was attempting to
       get the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic
       policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since
       March 1991, however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and
       eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
       efforts to institute economic reforms.
