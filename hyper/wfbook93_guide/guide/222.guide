Economy (Spratly Islands)
=========================


     Overview:
       Economic activity is limited to commercial fishing; proximity to nearby oil-
       and gas-producing sedimentary basins suggests the potential for oil and gas
       deposits, but the region is largely unexplored, and there are no reliable
       estimates of potential reserves; commercial exploitation has yet to be
       developed.
     Industries:
       none
