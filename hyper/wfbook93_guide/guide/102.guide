Economy (Guyana)
================


     Overview:
       Guyana is one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita income less
       than one-fifth the South American average. After growing on average at less
       than 1% a year in 1986-87, GDP dropped by 5% a year in 1988-90. The decline
       resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the cane fields, and flooding
       and equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about
       100% in 1989 and 75% in 1990, and the current account deficit widened
       substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric power
       has been in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in
       national output. The government, in association with international financial
       agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds. The
       government's stabilization program - aimed at establishing realistic
       exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth -
       requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
       by consumers during a long incubation period. Buoyed by a recovery in mining
       and agriculture, the economy posted 6% growth in 1991 and 7% growth in 1992,
       according to official figures. A large volume of illegal and quasi-legal
       economic activity is not captured in estimates of the country's total
       output.
     National product:
       GDP - exchange rate conversion - $267.5 million (1992 est.)
     National product real growth rate:
       7% (1992 est.)
     National product per capita:

     Unemployment rate:
       12%-15% (1991 est.)
     Budget:
       revenues $121 million; expenditures $225 million, including capital
       expenditures of $50 million (1990 est.)
     Exports:
       $268 million (f.o.b., 1992 est.)
      commodities:
       sugar, bauxite/alumina, rice, gold, shrimp, molasses, timber, rum
      partners:
       UK 28%, US 25%, FRG 8%, Canada 7%, Japan 6% (1989)
     Imports:

       manufactures, machinery, food, petroleum
      partners:
       US 40%, Trinidad & Tobago 13%, UK 11%, Japan 5%, Netherland Antilles 3%
       (1989)
     External debt:
       $2 billion including arrears (1990)
     Industrial production:
       growth rate 12% (1990 est.); accounts for about 24% of GDP
     Electricity:
       253,500 kW capacity; 276 million kWh produced, 370 kWh per capita (1992)
     Industries:
       bauxite mining, sugar, rice milling, timber, fishing (shrimp), textiles,
       gold mining
     Agriculture:
       most important sector, accounting for 25% of GDP and about half of exports;
       sugar and rice are key crops; development potential exists for fishing and
       forestry; not self-sufficient in food, especially wheat, vegetable oils, and
       animal products
