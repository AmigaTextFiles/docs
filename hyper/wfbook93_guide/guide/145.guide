Economy (Macedonia)
===================


     Overview:
       Macedonia, although the poorest among the six republics of a dissolved
       Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and energy needs through its own
       agricultural and coal resources. It will, however, move down toward a bare
       subsistence level of life unless economic ties are reforged or enlarged with
       its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria. The
       economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and its modern
       machinery and parts. Continued political turmoil, both internally and in the
       region as a whole, prevents any swift readjustments of trade patterns and
       economic programs. Inflation in early 1992 was out of control, the result of
       fracturing trade links, the decline in economic activity, and general
       uncertainties about the future status of the country; prices rose 38% in
       March 1992 alone. In August 1992, Greece, angry at the use of "Macedonia" as
       the republic's name, imposed a partial blockade for several months. This
       blockade, combined with the effects of the UN sanctions on Serbia and
       Montenegro, cost the economy approximately $1 billion in 1992 according to
       official figures. Macedonia's geographical isolation, technological
       backwardness, and potential political instability place it far down the list
       of countries of interest to Western investors. Resolution of the dispute
       with Greece and an internal commitment to economic reform would help to
       encourage foreign investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the
       worst scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its
       borders.
