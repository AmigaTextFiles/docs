Economy (Gabon)
===============


     Overview:
       The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until the early 1970s, is now
       dominated by the oil sector. In 1981-85, oil accounted for about 45% of GDP,
       80% of export earnings, and 65% of government revenues on average. The high
       oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial increase in per
       capita national income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced migration
       from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to among the
       highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The subsequent slide of Gabon's economy,
       which began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989-90, but
       debt servicing obligations continue to limit prospects for further domestic
       development. Real growth in 1991-92 was weak because of a combination of an
       overstaffed bureaucracy, a large budget deficit, and the continued
       underdevelopment of the whole economy outside the petroleum sector.

       GDP - exchange rate conversion - $4.6 billion (1991)
