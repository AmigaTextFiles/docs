Economy (Papua New Guinea)
==========================


     Overview:
       Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation
       has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing an
       infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the
       population. Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and gold, accounts
       for about 60% of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and
       development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy.
       Robust growth in 1991-92 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a
       large new gold mine helped the advance.
