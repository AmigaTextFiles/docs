Geography (Indian Ocean)
========================


     Location:
       body of water between Africa, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica
     Map references:
       Southeast Asia, Standard Time Zones of the World
     Area:
      total area:
       73.6 million km2
      comparative area:
       slightly less than eight times the size of the US; third-largest ocean
       (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the Arctic
       Ocean)
      note:
       includes Arabian Sea, Bass Straight, Bay of Bengal, Java Sea, Persian Gulf,
       Red Sea, Straight of Malacca, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies
     Coastline:
       66,526 km
     International disputes:
       some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
     Climate:
       northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to October);
       tropical cyclones occur during May/June and October/November in the north
       Indian Ocean and January/February in the south Indian Ocean
     Terrain:
       surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system of
       currents) in the south Indian Ocean; unique reversal of surface currents in
       the north Indian Ocean, low atmospheric pressure over southwest Asia from
       hot, rising, summer air results in the southwest monsoon and
       southwest-to-northeast winds and currents, while high pressure over northern
       Asia from cold, falling, winter air results in the northeast monsoon and
       northeast-to-southwest winds and currents; ocean floor is dominated by the
       Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge,
       Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, and Ninety East Ridge; maximum depth is 7,258
       meters in the Java Trench
     Natural resources:
       oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
       deposits, polymetallic nodules
     Environment:
       endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales;
       oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea
     Note:
       major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of
       Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait; ships
       subject to superstructure icing in extreme south near Antarctica from May to
       October

Economy (Indian Ocean)
======================


     Overview:
       The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle East,
       Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries a
       particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the oil
       fields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing
       importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export.
       Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian
       Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being
       tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western
       Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes
       from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore
       placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly
       India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
     Industries:
       based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
       minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,
       placer deposits
