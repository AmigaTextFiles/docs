Economy (Faroe Islands)
=======================


     Overview:
       The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living standards of the
       Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the
       all-important fishing industry and one of the world's heaviest per capita
       external debts of nearly $30,000. When the nations of the world extended
       their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no
       longer could continue their traditional long-distance fishing and
       subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The government's tight
       controls on fish stocks and its austerity measures have caused a recession,
       and subsidy cuts will force nationalization in the fishing industry, which
       has already been plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to
       withhold its annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the
       islands' budget revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to
       balance their budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected to
       continue its tough policies, including introducing a 20% VAT in 1993, and
       has agreed to an IMF economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to
       its annual subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out the second largest
       Faroe bank to the tune of $140 million since October 1992.
