Economy (Mongolia)
==================


     Overview:
       Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of
       unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic activity
       traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock -
       Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world. In
       recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet
       support. The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,
       tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial production. Timber
       and fishing are also important sectors. In 1992 the Mongolian leadership
       continued its struggle with severe economic dislocations, mainly
       attributable to the crumbling of the USSR, by far Mongolia's leading trade
       and development partner. Moscow cut almost all aid in 1991, and little was
       provided in 1992. Industry in 1992 was hit hard by energy shortages, mainly
       due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports.
       By the end of the year, the country was perilously close to a complete
       shutdown of its centralized energy supply system, due to critical coal
       shortages. The government is moving away from the Soviet-style, centrally
       planned economy through privatization and price reform.
