Economy (Equatorial Guinea)
===========================


     Overview:
       The economy, devastated during the regime of former President Macias NGUEMA,
       is based on agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account for about half
       of GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence agriculture predominates, with
       cocoa, coffee, and wood products providing income, foreign exchange, and
       government revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts for about
       8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for about
       38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese,
       uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under concessions
       offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately successful.
       Increased production from recently discovered natural gas deposits will
       provide a greater share of exports by 1995.
