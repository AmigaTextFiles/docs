Economy (Azerbaijan)
====================


     Overview:
       Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia,
       the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
       its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low
       standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil,
       and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
       for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate
       the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,
       marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim
       Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
       accounted for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former
       Soviet Union. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet
       republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy, but
       its considerable energy resources brighten its propects somewhat. Old
       economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced. A particularly galling
       constraint on economic revival is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to
       consume 25% of Azerbaijan's economic resources.
