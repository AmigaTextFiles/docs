     Overview:
       Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort,
       attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The Principality has
       successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added,
       nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes
       and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established
       residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices.
       About 50% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
       banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism.

       prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.
