Geography (Atlantic Ocean)
==========================


     Location:
       body of water between the Western Hemisphere and Europe/Africa
     Map references:   Africa, Antarctic Region, Arctic Region, Central America and the Caribbean,
       Europe, North America, South America, Standard Time Zones of the World
     Area:
      total area:
       82.217 million km2
      comparative area:
       slightly less than nine times the size of the US; second-largest of the
       world's four oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than Indian Ocean
       or Arctic Ocean)
      note:
       includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark Strait,
       Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea,
       Weddell Sea, and other tributary water bodies
     Coastline:
       111,866 km
     International disputes:
       some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
     Climate:
       tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa near Cape
       Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can occur from
       May to December, but are most frequent from August to November
     Terrain:
       surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, and
       Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm water gyre (broad, circular
       system of currents) in the north Atlantic, counterclockwise warm water gyre
       in the south Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic
       Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin;
       maximum depth is 8,605 meters in the Puerto Rico Trench
     Natural resources:
       oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales), sand and gravel
       aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, precious stones
     Environment:
       endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles,
       and whales; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US, southern Brazil, and
       eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake
       Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; industrial waste and municipal
       sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea; icebergs
       common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the northwestern Atlantic from
       February to August and have been spotted as far south as Bermuda and the
       Madeira Islands; icebergs from Antarctica occur in the extreme southern
       Atlantic
     Note:
       ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north Atlantic from October
       to May and extreme south Atlantic from May to October; persistent fog can be
       a hazard to shipping from May to September; major choke points include the
       Dardanelles, Strait of Gibraltar, access to the Panama and Suez Canals;
       strategic straits include the Dover Strait, Straits of Florida, Mona
       Passage, The Sound (Oresund), and Windward Passage; north Atlantic shipping
       lanes subject to icebergs from February to August; the Equator divides the
       Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean
