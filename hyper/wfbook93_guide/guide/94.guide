Economy (Greenland)
===================


     Overview:
       Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult and unemployment
       increases. Prospects for economic growth in the immediate future are not
       bright. The Home Rule Government's economic restraint measures introduced in
       the late 1980s have assisted in shifting red figures into a balance in the
       public budget. Foreign trade produced a surplus in 1989 and 1990, but has
       now returned to a deficit. Following the closing of the Black Angel lead and
       zinc mine in 1989, Greenland today is fully dependent on fishing and fish
       processing, this sector accounting for 95% of exports. Prospects for
       fisheries are not bright, as the important shrimp catches will at best
       stabilize and cod catches have dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon
       activities is not around the corner, thus leaving only tourism with some
       potential for the near future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e. the HRG
       and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in
       Greenland accounting for about two thirds of total employment. About half
       the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish Government.
