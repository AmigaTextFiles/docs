Economy (Poland)
================


     Overview:
       Poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a Soviet-style economy -
       with state ownership and control of productive assets - to a market economy.
       On January 1, 1990, the new Solidarity-led government implemented shock
       therapy by slashing subsidies, decontrolling prices, tightening the money
       supply, stabilizing the foreign exchange rate, lowering import barriers, and
       restraining state sector wages. As a result, consumer goods shortages and
       lines disappeared, and inflation fell from 640% in 1989 to 44% in 1992.
       Western governments, which hold two-thirds of Poland's $48 billion external
       debt, pledged in 1991 to forgive half of Poland's official debt by 1994. The
       private sector accounted for 29% of industrial production and nearly half of
       nonagricultural output in 1992. Production fell in state enterprises,
       however, and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing
       in 1989 to 13.6% in December 1992. Poland fell out of compliance with its
       IMF program by mid-1991, and talks with commercial creditors stalled. The
       increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to strikes
       in the coal, auto, copper, and railway sectors in 1992. Large state
       enterprises in the coal, steel, and defense sectors plan to halve employment
       over the next decade, and the government expects unemployment to reach 3
       million (16%) in 1993. A shortfall in tax revenues caused the budget deficit
       to reach 6% of GDP in 1992, but industrial production began a slow, uneven
       upturn. In 1993, the government will struggle to win legislative approval
       for faster privatization and to keep the budget deficit within IMF-approved
       limits.
     National product:
       GDP - purchasing power equivalent - $167.6 billion (1992 est.)

       2% (1992 est.)

      commodities:

       6% (1991)
      partners:
       Germany 17.4%, former USSR 25.6%, Italy 5.3%, Austria 5.2% (1991)
     External debt:
       $48.5 billion (January 1992); note - Poland's Western government creditors
       promised in 1991 to forgive 30% of Warsaw's official debt - currently $33
       billion - immediately and to forgive another 20% in 1994, if Poland adheres
       to its IMF program
     Industrial production:
       growth rate 3.5% (1992)
