Economy (Benin)
===============


     Overview:
       Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world because of
       limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure. Agriculture
       accounts for about 35% of GDP, employs about 60% of the labor force, and
       generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings. The industrial sector
       contributes only about 15% to GDP and employs 2% of the work force. Low
       prices in recent years have kept down hard currency earnings from Benin's
       major exports of agricultural products and crude oil.
