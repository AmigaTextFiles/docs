Economy (Libya)
===============


     Overview:
       The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil
       sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and about
       one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at
       $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response
       to changes in the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient
       resource allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs,
       although the reopening of the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the
       Libyan-Egyptian border in December 1989 have eased shortages. Austerity
       budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the government's
       ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure development
       projects. Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990
       improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current account
       surplus for the first time in five years. The nonoil manufacturing and
       construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from
       processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals, iron,
       steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it
       employs about 20% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils
       severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food
       requirements.
     National product:
       GDP - exchange rate conversion - $26.1 billion (1992 est.)
     National product real growth rate:
       0.2% (1992 est.)

       7% (1991 est.)

       NA%
     Budget:
       revenues $8.1 billion; expenditures $9.8 billion, including capital
       expenditures of $3.1 billion (1989 est.)
     Exports:
       $9.71 billion (f.o.b., 1992)
      commodities:
       crude oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas
      partners:

     External debt:
       $3.5 billion excluding military debt (1991 est.)
     Industrial production:
       growth rate 10.5%; accounts for 7.6% of GDP (not including oil) (1990)
     Electricity:
       4,935,000 kW capacity; 14,385 million kWh produced, 2,952 kWh per capita
       (1992)
     Industries:
       petroleum, food processing, textiles, handicrafts, cement
     Agriculture:
       5% of GNP; cash crops - wheat, barley, olives, dates, citrus fruits,
       peanuts; 75% of food is imported
