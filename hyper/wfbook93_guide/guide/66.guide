Economy (Djibouti)
==================


     Overview:
       The economy is based on service activities connected with the country's
       strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa.
       Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
       international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural
       resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent
       on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
       development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a
       major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last
       five years because of recession and a high population growth rate (including
       immigrants and refugees).
     National product:
       GDP - exchange rate conversion - $358 million (1990 est.)
     National product real growth rate:
       1.2% (1990 est.)
     National product per capita:
       $1,030 (1990 est.)
     Inflation rate (consumer prices):
       7.7% (1991 est.)
     Unemployment rate:
       over 30% (1989)
     Budget:
       revenues $170 million; expenditures $203 million, including capital
       expenditures of $70 million (1991 est.)
     Exports:
       $186 million (f.o.b., 1991 est.)
      commodities:   hides and skins, coffee (in transit)
      partners:
       Africa 50%, Middle East 40%, Western Europe 9%
     Imports:
       $360 million (f.o.b., 1991 est.)
      commodities:
       foods, beverages, transport equipment, chemicals, petroleum products
      partners:
       Western Europe 54%, Middle East 20%, Asia 19%
     External debt:
       $355 million (December 1990)
     Industrial production:
       growth rate 10.0% (1990); manufacturing accounts for 11% of GDP
     Electricity:
       115,000 kW capacity; 200 million kWh produced, 580 kWh per capita (1991)
     Industries:
       limited to a few small-scale enterprises, such as dairy products and
       mineral-water bottling
     Agriculture:
       accounts for only 3% of GDP; scanty rainfall limits crop production to
       mostly fruit and vegetables; half of population pastoral nomads herding
       goats, sheep, and camels; imports bulk of food needs
     Economic aid:
       US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY78-89), $39 million; Western (non-US)
       countries, including ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $1.1
       billion; OPEC bilateral aid (1979-89), $149 million; Communist countries
       (1970-89), $35 million
     Currency:
       1 Djiboutian franc (DF) = 100 centimes
     Exchange rates:
       Djiboutian francs (DF) per US$1 - 177.721 (fixed rate since 1973)
