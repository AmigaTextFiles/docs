Geography (Pacific Ocean)
=========================


     Location:
       body of water between the Western Hemisphere and Asia/Australia
     Map references:
       Asia, North America, Oceania, South America, Standard Time Zones of the
       World
     Area:
      total area:
       165.384 million km2
      comparative area:
       about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed by the
       Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about
       one-third of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the
       world
      note:
       includes Arafura Sea, Banda Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering
       Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Makassar Strait,
       Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China Sea,
       Tasman Sea, and other tributary water bodies
     Coastline:
       135,663 km
     International disputes:
       some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
     Climate:
       the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the summer
       months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a
       dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land
       mass back to the ocean
     Terrain:
       surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a clockwise,
       warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in the southern
       Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the northern Pacific sea
       ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in winter; in the southern
       Pacific sea ice from Antarctica reaches its northernmost extent in October;
       the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific
       Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the
       world's deepest, the 10,924 meter Marianas Trench
     Natural resources:
       oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
       deposits, fish
     Environment:
       endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals,
       turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea;
       dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the
       southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in
       southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to
       October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
       Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and
       September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica;
       occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade
       winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing
       the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies; consequently,
       the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds
       to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source

Geography (Pacific Ocean 2. usage)
==================================


     Note:
       the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
       and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
       North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships subject to
       superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme
       south from May to October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June
       to December is a hazard to shipping; surrounded by a zone of violent
       volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring
       of Fire

Economy (Pacific Ocean)
=======================


     Overview:
       The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
       particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides
       low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing
       grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
       construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish
       catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish
       catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and
       gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of
       Australia, New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering
       offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
       since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.
     Industries:
       fishing, oil and gas production
