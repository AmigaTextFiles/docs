Economy (Niue)
==============


     Overview:
       The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand. Government
       expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by grants
       from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public employees. The
       agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some
       cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small
       factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The
       sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
       revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of
       population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.
