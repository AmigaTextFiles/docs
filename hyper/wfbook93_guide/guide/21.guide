Economy (Bangladesh)
====================


     Overview:
       Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and least
       developed nations. Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural. Major
       impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, government
       interference with the economy, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be
       absorbed by agriculture, a low level of industrialization, failure to fully
       exploit energy resources (natural gas), and inefficient and inadequate power
       supplies. An excellent rice crop and expansion of the export garment
       industry helped growth in FY91/92. Policy reforms intended to reduce
       government regulation of private industry and promote public-sector
       efficiency have been announced but are being implemented only slowly.
