Economy (Georgia)
=================


     Overview:
       Among the former Soviet republics, Georgia has been noted for its Black Sea
       tourist industry, its large output of citrus fruits and tea, and an
       industrial sector that accounted, however, for less than 2% of the USSR's
       output. Another salient characteristic of the economy has been a flourishing
       private sector (compared with the other republics). About 25% of the labor
       force is employed in agriculture. Mineral resources consist of manganese and
       copper, and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury.
       Except for very small quantities of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must
       be imported from neighboring republics. Oil and its products have been
       delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to the port of Batumi for export and
       local refining. Gas has been supplied in pipelines from Krasnodar and
       Stavropol'. The dismantling of central economic controls has been delayed by
       political factionalism, marked by bitter armed struggles. In early 1993 the
       Georgian economy was operating at well less than half capacity due to
       disruptions in fuel supplies and vital transportation links as a result of
       conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, antigovernment activity in Western
       Georgia, and Azerbaijani pressure against Georgian assistance for Armenia.
       To restore economic viability, Georgia must establish domestic peace and
       must maintain economic ties to the other former Soviet republics while
       developing new links to the West.
