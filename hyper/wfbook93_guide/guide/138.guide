Economy (Lesotho)
=================


     Overview:
       Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
       resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light
       manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa ($439
       million in 1991). The great majority of households gain their livelihoods
       from subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on
       farm products to support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries;
       other industries include textile, clothing, and construction (in particular,
       a major water improvement project which will permit the sale of water to
       South Africa). Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989.
       Political and economic instability in South Africa raises uncertainty for
       Lesotho's economy, especially with respect to migrant worker remittances -
       recently the equivalent of nearly three-fourths of domestic output.
     National product:
       GDP - exchange rate conversion - $620 million (1991 est.)
      note:

     Inflation rate (consumer prices):

     Unemployment rate:

       expenditures of $132 million (FY93)

     External debt:

     Industrial production:
       growth rate 5.0% (1991 est.); accounts for 11% of GDP

       power supplied by South Africa
     Industries:

     Agriculture:
       accounts for 19% of GDP (1990 est.) and employs 60-70% of all households;
       exceedingly primitive, mostly subsistence farming and livestock; principal
       crops corn, wheat, pulses, sorghum, barley
