Economy (Ghana)
===============


     Overview:
       Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
       implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including
       moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily
       dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not
       spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
       peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
       democratic government have boosted government expenditures and undercut
       structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in 1990.
       Meanwhile, declining world commodity prices for Ghana's exports has placed
       the government under severe financial pressure.
