Economy (Uganda)
================


     Overview:
       Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular
       rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. The economy has
       been devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and
       civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor with a per capita
       income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as
       does industrial production.) Agriculture is the most important sector of the
       economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export
       crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government
       has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency
       reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of
       petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes
       are especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over 300%
       in 1987, and boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-92, the
       economy has turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in
       the rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
       exports, and gradually improving domestic security.
