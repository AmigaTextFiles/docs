Economy (Armenia)
=================


     Overview:
       Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile,
       machine-building, and other industries and had become a key supplier to
       sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials
       and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the
       republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has
       been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the
       Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave
       within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright
       warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the
       Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleaguered
       Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed
       about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has
       not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been
       disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
       USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the
       earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of
       Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of
       the output of elevators in the former USSR. Armenia has some deposits of
       nonferrous metal ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) that are
       largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects seem
       particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high
       dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of
       transformation. The dramatic drop in output in 1992 is attributable largely
       to the cumulative impact of the blockade; of particular importance was the
       shutting off in the summer of 1992 of rail and road links to Russia through
       Georgia due to civil strife in the latter republic.
