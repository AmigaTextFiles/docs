Economy (Nepal)
===============


     Overview:
       Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
       Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over
       90% of the population and accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity is
       limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute,
       sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has
       expanded recently and accounted for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in
       FY91. Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural
       resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production in the
       late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population growth of
       2.6%. More than 40% of the population is undernourished partly because of
       poor distribution. The top 10% of the population receives 47% of total
       income, the bottom 20% less than 5% of the total. Since May 1991, the
       government has been encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by
       eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order to
       simplify domestic and foreign investment. The government also has been
       cutting public expenditures by reducing subsides, privatizing state
       industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign trade and
       investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the small size of
       the economy, its technological backwardness, and its remoteness.
     National product:
       GDP - exchange rate conversion - $3.4 billion (FY92)
     National product real growth rate:
       3.1% (FY92)

     Industries:

       cement, and brick production; tourism
     Agriculture:
       accounts for 60% of GDP and 90% of work force; farm products - rice, corn,
       wheat, sugarcane, root crops, milk, buffalo meat; not self-sufficient in
       food, particularly in drought years
