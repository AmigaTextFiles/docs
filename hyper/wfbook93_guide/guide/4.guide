Economy (Andorra)
=================


     Overview:
       The mainstay of Andorra's economy is tourism. An estimated 13 million
       tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its
       summer and winter resorts. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status,
       also contributes significantly to the economy. Agricultural production is
       limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The
       principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly
       of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Although it is a member of the EC
       customs union, it is unclear what effect the European Single Market will
       have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free status.
