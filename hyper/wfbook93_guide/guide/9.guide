Geography (Arctic Ocean)
========================


     Location:
       body of water mostly north of the Arctic Circle
     Map references:
       Arctic Region, Asia, North America, Standard Time Zones of the World
     Area:
      total area:
       14.056 million km2
      comparative area:
       slightly more than 1.5 times the size of the US; smallest of the world's
       four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean)
      note:
       includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian
       Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, and
       other tributary water bodies
     Coastline:
       45,389 km
     International disputes:
       some maritime disputes (see littoral states); Svalbard is the focus of a
       maritime boundary dispute between Norway and Russia
     Climate:
       polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual
       temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous darkness, cold and
       stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers characterized by
       continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or
       snow
     Terrain:
       central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that averages
       about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges may be three times
       that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral Stream, but nearly
       straight line movement from the New Siberian Islands (Russia) to Denmark
       Strait (between Greenland and Iceland); the ice pack is surrounded by open
       seas during the summer, but more than doubles in size during the winter and
       extends to the encircling land masses; the ocean floor is about 50%
       continental shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a
       central basin interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera,
       Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonsov Ridge); maximum depth is 4,665 meters in the
       Fram Basin
     Natural resources:
       sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, oil and
       gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales)
     Environment:
       endangered marine species include walruses and whales; ice islands
       occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island; icebergs calved from
       glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada; maximum snow
       cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean and
       lasts about 10 months; permafrost in islands; virtually icelocked from
       October to June; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from
       disruptions or damage
     Note:
       major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the Pacific
       Ocean via the Bering Strait); ships subject to superstructure icing from
       October to May; strategic location between North America and Russia;
       shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia,
       floating research stations operated by the US and Russia

Economy (Arctic Ocean)
======================


     Overview:
       Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of natural resources,
       including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and seals.

Communications (Arctic Ocean)
=============================


     Ports:
       Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay (US)
     Telecommunications:
       no submarine cables
     Note:
       sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the Northwest Passage
       (North America) and Northern Sea Route (Eurasia) are important seasonal
       waterways
