Economy (Kiribati)
==================


     Overview:
       The country has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
       deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish
       now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated
       widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987, as the fish
       catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986 and copra production
       was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded strongly in 1988, with real
       GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in economic growth came from an increase in
       copra production and a good fish catch. Following the strong surge in output
       in 1988, GNP increased 1% in both 1989 and 1990.
     National product:
