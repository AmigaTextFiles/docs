       expenditures of $NA (1993 est.)

     Industries:   printing and production of a small amount of mosaics and staff uniforms;
       worldwide banking and financial activities
     Currency:
       1 Vatican lira (VLit) = 100 centesimi
     Exchange rates:
       Vatican lire (VLit) per US$1 - 1,482.5 (January 1993), 1,232.4 (1992),
       1,240.6 (1991), 1,198.1 (1990), 1,372.1 (1989), 1,301.6 (1988); note - the
