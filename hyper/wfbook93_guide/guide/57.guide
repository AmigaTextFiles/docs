Economy (Cook Islands)
======================


     Overview:
       Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are fruit,
       copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a
       fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development
       is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
       of natural resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is
       annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid.
       Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
       and expanding the fishing industry.
