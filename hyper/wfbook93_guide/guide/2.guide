Economy (Algeria)
=================


     Overview:
       The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy,
       hydrocarbons accounting for nearly all export receipts, about 30% of
       government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in
       oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
       program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the
       mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the
       nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since full
       independence in 1988. The current government has put reform, including
       privatization of some public sector companies and an overhaul of the banking
       and financial system, on hold, but has continued efforts to admit private
       enterprise to the hydrocarbon industry.
