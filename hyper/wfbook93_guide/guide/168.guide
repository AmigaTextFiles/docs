Economy (Nauru)
===============


     Overview:
       Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
       expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans
       one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World - $10,000 annually.
       Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including
       fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
       replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems.
       Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
       cushion the transition.
