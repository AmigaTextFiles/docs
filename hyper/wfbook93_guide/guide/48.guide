Economy (Chad)
==============


     Overview:
       The climate, geographic location, and lack of infrastructure and natural
       resources make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in the world.
       Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict with Libya,
       drought, and food shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its 1977 level,
       with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports. Over 80% of
       the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing. Industry is
       based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural products, including
       cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, with
       its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from shortages. Oil
       companies are exploring areas north of Lake Chad and in the Doba basin in
       the south. Good crop weather led to 8.4% growth in 1991.
     National product:
       GDP - exchange rate conversion - $1.1 billion (1991 est.)
     National product real growth rate:
       8.4% (1991 est.)

     External debt:
       $492 million (December 1990 est.)
     Industrial production:
       growth rate 12.9% (1989 est.); accounts for nearly 15% of GDP

       accounts for about 45% of GDP; largely subsistence farming; cotton most
       important cash crop; food crops include sorghum, millet, peanuts, rice,
       potatoes, manioc; livestock - cattle, sheep, goats, camels; self-sufficient
       in food in years of adequate rainfall
     Economic aid:
       US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $198 million; Western (non-US)
       countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $1.5 billion; OPEC
       bilateral aid (1979-89), $28 million; Communist countries (1970-89), $80
