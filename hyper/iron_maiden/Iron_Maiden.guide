 You're standing in the wings, there you wait for the curtain to fall.
 Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.
 Yeah, I know that you're gonna scratch me, maim me and maul.
 You know I'm helpless from your mesmerising cat call.

 Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait.
 Don't you stray, don't fade away.
 Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may.
 Don't you stray, from the narrow way.

 I'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there.
 You're the Phantom of the Opera, you're the devil, you're just out to scare.

 Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound.
 All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world.
 Shades of green grasses twine, girls drinking plasma wine.

 Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?
 Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?

 Chorus:

 Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs,
 Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed.
 Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood,
 Charlotte the Harlot let me see love.

 Taking so many men to your room, don't you feel no remorse?
 You charge them a "fiver", It's only for starters.
 And ten for the main course.
 And you've got no feelings, they died long ago.
 Don't you care who you let in?
 And don't you know you're breaking the law with the service you're giving.

 Chorus:

 There was a time when you left me standing there,
 Picking up pieces of love off the floor.
 Well Charlotte you left me alone in there,
 To make your ends as a bloody whore.
 Well Charlotte you told me you love me true,
 Picking up pieces of love yesterday.
 Well Charlotte you're draws are off color too
 'Cause you're making love all day.

 Giving a swish with your arse in the air, don't you know what they're saying?

 I remember it as plain as day
 although it happened in the dark of the night.
 I was strolling through the streets of Paris
 and it was cold it was starting to rain.
 And then I heard a piercing scream
 and I rushed to the scene of the crime
 but all I found was the butchered remains
 of two girls lay side by side.

 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 someone call the Gendarmes
 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 run before the killers go free

 There's some people coming down the street
 at last there's someone heard my call,
 I can't understand why they're pointing at me
 I never done nothing at all.
 But I must have got some blood on my hands
 because everyone's shouting at me,
 I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
 and like a fool I started running away.

 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 someone call the Gendarmes
 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 am I ever gonna be free.

 And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.
 All France is looking for me.
 I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
 down the south to Italy.

 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 someone call the Gendarmes
 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 I'm never going home.

 Well I made it to the border at last
 But I can't erase the scene from my mind
 Anytime somebody stares at me, well
 I just start running blind
 Well I'm moving through the shadows at night
 Away from the staring eyes
 Any day they'll be looking for me
 'Cause I know I show the signs of...

 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 running from the Gendarmes
 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 running from the arms of the law

 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 running from the Gendarmes
 Murders in the Rue Morgue
 am I ever gonna be free

 It took so long and I'm getting so tired
 I'm running out of places to hide
 Should I return to the scene of the crime
 Where the two young victims died
 If I could go to somebody for help,
 It'd get me out of trouble for sure.
 But I know that it's on my mind,
 That my doctor said I've done it before.

 Murders in the Rue Morgue,
 they're never gonna find me
 Murders in the Rue Morgue,

 Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed,
 Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs.

 My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise,
 The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night.
 I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed,
 A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me.

 I can see what a knife's meant to be,
 And you'll never know how I came to forsee, see, see.

 My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties,
 With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike.

 Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night,
 Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
 I have found you, and now there is no place to run,
 Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
 Oooh yeah, I've done it!

 She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call.
 But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all,
 Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form.
 It's been three long years since I've been gone.

 I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry.
 I'll never know the reason why I had to go.
 Oh, oh, I'm crying,
 Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.
 Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
 Ah can't you see me?

 I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me.
 I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
 Like to be hanging on the other side.
 I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died.

 I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone,
 Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone.
 Oh, oh, I'm crying,

 Call to arms defend yourselves get ready to stand and fight for your lives
 Judgment day has come around so be prepared don't run stand your ground

 They're coming in from the sea
 the've come the enemy
 beneath the blazing sun
 the battle has to be won
 Invaders ... Pilliging
 Invaders ... Looting

 Set ablaze the campfires alert the other men from inland
 Warning must be given there's not enough men here for a stand
 The Vikings are too many too powerful to take on our own
 We must have reinforcements we cannot fight this battle alone

 They've coming over the hill
 they've come to attack
 they're coming in for the kill
 there's no turning back
 Invaders ... Fighting
 Invaders ... Marauding

 Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
 Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
 The smell of death and burning flesh the battle weary fight to the end
 The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen

 You'd better scatter and run
 the battle's lost and not won
 you'd better get away
 to fight another day
 Invaders ... Raping

 If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
 I know a place where we can go
 22 Acacia Avenue meet a lady that I know
 So if you're looking for a good time
 And you're prepared to pay the price
 Fifteen quid is all she asks for
 Everybody's got their vice

 If you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece
 You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free
 So any time you're down the East End don't you hesitate to go
 You can take my honest word for it she'll teach you more than you can know

 Charlotte can't you get out from all of this madness
 Can't you see it only brings you sadness
 When you entertain your men don't you know the risk of getting disease

 Some day when you're reaching the edge of forty
 I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
 Nobody then will want to know
 You won't have any beautiful wares to show any more

 22, the avenue that's the place where we all go
 You will find it's warm inside the red light's burning bright tonight

 Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
 Don't you ever think about the bad times
 Why do you have to live this way
 Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay

 Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue
 The way you walk it makes men think of having you
 When you're walking down the street
 Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

 Beat her mistreat her do anything that you please
 Bite her excite her make her get down on her knees
 Abuse her misuse her she can take all that you've got
 Caress her molest her she always does what you want

 You're running away don't you know what you're doing
 Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin
 Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
 You believe that because what you're earning
 Your life's good don't you know that you're hurting
 All the people that love you don't cast them aside
 All the men that are constantly drooling
 It's no life for you stop all that screwing
 You're packing your bags and you're coming with me

 I left alone my mind was blank
 I needed time to get the momories from my mind
 
 What did I see can I believe that what I saw
 that night was real and not just fantasy

 Just what I saw in my old dreams were they
 reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

 Cos in my dreams it's always there the evil face that twists my mind
 and brings me to despair

 The night was black was no use holding back
 Cos I just had to see someone watching me
 In the mist dark figures move and twist
 was this all for real or some kind of hell
 666 the number of the beast
 Hell and fire was spawned to be released

 Torched blazed and sacred chants were praised
 as they start to cry hands held to the sky
 In the night the fires burning bright
 the ritual has begun Satan's work is done
 666 the number of the beast
 Sacrifice is going on tonight

 This can't go on I must inform the law
 Can this still be real or some crazy dream
 but I feel drawn towards the evil chanting hordes
 they seem to mesmerise me ... can't avoid their eyes
 666 the number of the beast
 666 the one for you and me

 I'm coming back I will return
 And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn

 Oh will we ever be set free?

 Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes
 Galloping hard on the plains
 Chasing the redskins back to their holes
 Fighting them at their own game
 Murder for freedom the stab in the back
 Women and children and cowards attack

 Run to the hills run for your lives
 Run to the hills run for your lives

 Soldier blue in the barren wastes
 Hunting and killing their game
 Raping the women and wasting the men
 The only good Indians are tame
 Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
 Enslaving the young and destroying the old

 Face at the window leers into your own
 But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
 How long can you hide? How long till they come?
 A rat in a trap but you've got to survive

 Once you were glad to be free for a while
 The air tasted good and the world was your friend
 Then came the day when the hard times began
 Now your alone but alive for how long?

 A knife at your throat another body on the pile
 A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
 Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
 Death on the streets or a blacked out jail

 Reflection on my past life and it doesn't have much time
 Cos at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
 The sands of time for me are running low

 When the priest comes to read me the last rites
 I take a look through the bars at the last sights
 Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

 Can it be there's been some sort of error
 Hard to stop the surmounting terror
 Is it really the end not some crazy dream

 Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
 It's not so easy to stop from screaming
 But words escape me when I try to speak
 Tears they flow but why am I crying
 After all am I not afraid of dying
 Don't I believe that there never is and end

 As the guards march me out to the courtyard
 Someone calls from a cell "God be with you"
 If there's a God then why has he let me die?

 As I walk all my life drifts before me
 And though the end is near I'm not sorry
 Catch my soul cos it's willing to fly away

 Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
 Please don't worry now that I have gone
 I've gone beyond to see the truth

 Maybe then you'll begin to understand
 Life down there is just a strange illusion

 The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly
 No one should go where eagles dare.

 Bavarian alps thay lay all around
 they seem to stare from below,
 The enemy lines a long time passed
 are lying deep in the snow.

 Into the night that fall through the sky
 No one should fly where eagles dare.

 They're closing in the fortress in near
 it's standing high in the sky,
 The Cable car's the only way in
 it's really impossible to climb.

 They make their way but maybe too late
 They've got to try to save the day.

 are echoing all around the valley,
 The mission complete they make to escape
 away from the Eagles Nest.

 "O God of Earth and Altar,
 Bow down and hear our cry,
 Our earthly rulers falter,
 Our people drift and die,
 The walls of gold entomb us,
 The swords of scorn divide,
 Take not thy thunder from us,
 But take away our pride."
 (G.K.Chesterton: English Hymnal)

 Just a babe in a black abyss,
 No reason for a place like this,
 The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
 An easy way for the blind to go,
 A clever path for the fools who know
 the Secret of the Hanged Man - the smile on his lips.

 The light of the Blind - you'll see,
 The venom that tears my spine,
 The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

 She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
 As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips,
 Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
 So we lay in a black embrace,
 And the Seed is sown in a holy place
 And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn.

 The light of the Blind - you'll see,
 The venom that tears my spine,
 The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

 Bind all of us together,
 Ablaze with Hope and Free,
 No storm or heavy weather
 Will rock the boat you'll see.

 And still the wind and rain,
 For the one who will be King
 Is the Watcher in the Ring.

 Looks the old man in the eye
 As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
 In the name of God my father I fly.

 And they thought that when the embers died away
 Thet the flame of life had burnt and died
 Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
 Were made by rubbin stick and stone.

 So they ploughed through forest and swamps of danger
 And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
 In the search to find another fire
 To regain the power of light and heat.

 A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
 A cut to the chest and you're down
 Seeing the stain then feeling the pain
 Feeling the sweat on your brow.

 Chorus:

 The fighting resumes, a silence looms the Swordsmen move 'gainst each other
 A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow, a stab to the heart and you're down
 The Angel of Death hears your last breath
 Meanwhile the reaper looks on.

 Chorus:
 OH ... OH ... Fought for the Honour
               Fought for the Splendour
               Fought for the Pleasure
 OH ... OH ... Fought for the Honour

 Turn the spotlights on the people,
 Switch the dial and eat the worm,
 Take your chances, kill the engine,
 Drop your bombs and let it burn.

 While flags shot to ribbons,
 The truce is black and burned,
 Shellshock in the kitchen,
 Tables overturned.

 Chorus:
 Back in the village again,
 In the village,
 I'm back back in the village again.

 Throwing dice now, rolling loaded,
 I see sixes all the way,
 In a black hole, And I'm spinning,
 As my wings get shot away.

 No breaks on the inside,
 Paper cats and burning barns,
 There's a fox among the chickens,
 And a killer in the hounds.

 Questions are a burden
 And answers are a prison for oneself
 Shellshock in the kitchen
 Tables start to burn.

 Chorus:

 But still we walk into the valley
 And others try to kill the inner flame
 We're burning brighter than before
 I don't have a number, I'M A NAME!

 Back in the village again
 In the village
 I'm back in the village again
 Back in the village again
 In the village

 I'm back in the village
 Back in the village
 Back in the village again.

 I don't wanna die, I'm a God, why can't I live on?
 When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid waste.
 And in my last hour, I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.

 When I was living this lie - Fear was my Game
 People would worship and fall - drop to their knees.
 So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me,
 For he is a man and a God - and He will die to.

 Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,
 Silent the terror that reigned - marbled in stone.
 Shell of a man God preserved - a thousand ages,
 But open the gates of my Hell - I will strike from the grave.

@{fg text}

 Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner
 See his eyes as he stops on of three
 Mesmerises on of the wedding guests
 Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the Sea.

 And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
 Caught by his spell and the Mariner tells his tale.

 Driven south to the of the snow and ice
 To a place where nobody's been
 Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
 Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.

 And the ship sails on, back to the North
 Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.

 The mariner kills the bird of good omen
 His shipmates cry against what he's done
 But when the fog clears, they justify him
 And make themselves a part of the crime.

 Sailing on and on North across the sea
 Sailing on and on North 'til all is calm.

 The albatross begins with his vengeance
 A terrible curse a thirst has begun
 His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
 About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

 And the curse goes on and on at sea
 And the curse goes on and on for them and me.

 "DAT AFTER DAY, DAY AFTER DAY, WE STUCK NOR BREATH NOR MOTION
 AS IDLE AS A PAINTED SHIP UPON A PAINTED OCEAN
 WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE AND ALL THE BOARDS DID SHRINK
 WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE NOR AND DROP TO DRINK."
 Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1798-1834)

 There, calls the Mariner, there comes a ship over the line
 But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and to tide.

 See ... onward she comes
 Onward she nears, out of the sun
 See ... she has no crew
 She has no life, wait but there's two.

 Death and she Life in Death, they throw their dice for the crew
 She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now.
 Then ... crew one by one
 They drop down dead, two hundred men
 She ... She, Life in Death.
 She lets him live, her chosen one.

 NARRATIVE
 "ONE AFTER ONE BY THE STAR DOGGED MOON,
 TOO QUICK FOR GROAN OR SIGH
 EACH CURSED HIS FACE WITH A GHASTLY PANG,
 AND CURSED ME WITH HIS EYES
 FOUR TIMES FIFTY LIVING MEN
 (AND I HEARD NOR SIGH NOR GROAN),
 WITH HEAVY THUMP, A LIFELESS LUMP,
 THEY DROPPED DOWN ONE BY ONE."
 Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1798-1834)

 The curse it lives on in their eyes
 The Mariner he wished he'd die
 Along with the sea creatures
 But they lived on, so did he.

 And by the light of the moon
 He prays for their beauty not doom
 With heart he blesses them
 God's creatures all of them too.

 Then the spell starts to break
 The albatross falls from his neck
 Sinks down like lead into the Sea
 Then down in falls comes the rain.

 Hear the groans of the long dead seamem
 See them stir and they start to rise
 Bodies lifted by good spirits
 None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes.

 And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
 Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

 Now the curse is finally lifted
 And the Mariner sights his home
 Spirits go from the long dead bodies
 Form their own light and the Mariner's left alone.

 And then a boat came sailing towards him
 It was a joy he could not believe
 The Pilot's boat, his son and the hermit.
 Penance of life will fall onto Him.

 And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
 And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins.

 The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
 To tell his tale wherever ho goes
 To teach God's word by his own example
 That we must love all things that God made.

 And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
 And the tale goes on and on and on.

 And my heart is lying there and will be 'til my dying day

 I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
 Is it now could it be the Angel of Death has come for me

 I can't believe that really my time has come
 I don't feel ready there's so much left undone
 And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away

 Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait
 Heaven can wait / Heaven can wait til another day

 I have a lust for the Earth below
 And Hell itself is my only foe
 'Cause I've no fear of dying
 I'll go when I'm good and ready

 I snatch a glimpse of the lights eternal rays
 I see a tunnel I staned amazed
 At all of the people standing there in front of me

 Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
 Is this the place where the living join the dead
 I wish I knew this way only just a nightmare

 Chorus:

 Take my hand I'll lead you to the promised land
 Take my hand I'll give you immortality
 Eternal youth I'll take you to the other side
 To see the truth the path for you is decided

 My body tingles I feel so strange
 I feel so tired I feel so drained
 And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again

 Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell
 Maybe I'm going down there as well
 I can't accept my soul will drift forever

 I fell myself floating back down to Earth
 So could this be hour of my rebirth
 Or have I died or will wake from dreaming?

 And every breath you take
 Determination

 Makes you run never stop
 Got to win got to run 'til you drop
 Keep the pace hold the race
 Your mind is getting clearer
 You're over half may there
 But the miles they never seem to end
 As if you're in a dream
 Not getting anywhere
 Is seems so futile

 Run on and on
 Run on and on
 The loneliness of the long distance runner

 Must be so determined and push myself on

 Run over stiles across fields
 Turn to look at who's on your heels
 Way ahead at the field
 The line is getting nearer but do
 You want the glory the goes
 You reach the final strech
 Ideals are just a trace
 You feel like throwing the race

 Preserved in time for all to see
 No brave new world, no brave no world
 Lost in this place, to leave no trace

 What became of the men that started
 All are gone and their souls departed
 Left me here in this place

 "MY SON ASK FOR THYSELF ANOTHER
 KINGDOM, FOR THAT WHICK I LEAVE
 IS TOO SMALL FOR THEE"
 (King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)

 Near to the east
 In a part of ancient Greece
 In an ancient land called Macedonia
 Was born a son
 To Philip of Macedon
 The legend his name was Alexander

 At the age of nineteen
 He became the Macedon King
 And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
 By the Aegian Sea
 In 334 B.C.
 He utterly beat the armies of Persia

 Chorus:
 Alexander the Great
 His name struck fear into hearts of men
 Alexander the Great
 Became a legend 'mongst mortal men

 King Darius the third
 Defeated fled Persia
 The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
 The Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
 And he founded the city called Alexandria

 By the Tigris river
 He met King Darius again
 And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
 Entering Babylon
 And Susa, treasures he found
 Took Persepolis the capital of Persia

 Chorus:
 Alexander the Great
 His name struck fear into hearts of men
 Alexander the Great
 Became a God amongst mortal men

 A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
 And Alexander cut the 'Goardian knot'
 And legend said that who untied the knot
 He would become the master of Asia

 Helonism he spread far and wide
 The Macedonian learned mind
 Their culture was a Western way of life
 He poved the way for Christianity

 Marching on, marching on

 The battle weary marching side by side
 Alexander's army line by line
 They wouldn't follow him to India
 Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

 Alexander the Great
 His name struck fear into hearts of men
 Alexander the Great
 He died of fever in Babylon

 Don't you dare to save your son
 Kill him now and save the young ones
 Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
 Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name

 Open the seventh seal
 Moonchild - You'll be mine soon child
 Moonchild - take my hand tonight

 I count the heads of those unborn
 The accursed ones I'll find them all
 If you die by your own hand
 As a suicide you shall be damned
 And if you try to save your soul
 I will torment you - you shall not grow old
 With every second and passing breath
 You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death

 The twins they are exhausted, seven is the night
 Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
 Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul
 When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

 One more dies one more lives
 One baby cries one mother grieves
 For all the sins you will commit
 You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
 A web of fear shall be your coat

 Infinite dreams I can't deny them.
 Infinity is hard to comprehend
 I couldn't hear those screams
 Even in my wildest dreams

 Suffocation waking in a sweat
 Scared to fall asleep again
 Incase the dream begins again
 Someone chasing I cannot move
 Standing rigid nightmare's statue
 What a dream when will it end
 And will I transcend?

 Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
 One nightmare ends another fertile
 Getting to me so scared to sleep
 But scared to wake now, in too deep.

 Even though its reached new heights
 I rather like the restless nights
 It makes me wonder it makes me think
 There's more to this I'm on the brink
 It's not the fear of what's beyond
 It's just that I might not respond
 I have an interest almost craving
 But would I like to get too far it?

 It can't all be coincedence
 Too many things are evident
 You tell me you're an unbeliever
 Spirtualist? Well me I'm neither
 But wouldn't you like to know
 The truth
 Of what's out there to have the proof
 And find out just which side
 You're on
 Where would you end in Heaven or
 In Hell?

 Help me. Help me to find my true
 Self without seeing the future
 Save me, save me from torturing
 Myself even within my dreams

 There's goes to be just more to it
 Than this
 Or tell me why do we exist
 I'd like to think that when I die
 I'd get a chance another time
 And to return and live again
 Reincarnate, play the game
 Again and again and again.

 Your fate your fortune's in my visions
 Heed what I say and you'll see what

 Please listen to me

 Now they put all the blame unto me
 They feel I brought on a curse
 Don't they know that the torment
 It stays with me knowing that I walk alone
 Through the eyes of the future I see
 They don't even know what fear is

 The book of life is silent
 No turning back

 Only the good die young
 All the evil seem to live forever
 Only the good die young
 All the evil seem to live forever
 Only the good die young
 Only the good die young

 Mystery madman a victim of cruel charade
 Some innocent pawn in an end game one more stalemate
 Is death another birthday?
 A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
 Do the undead live within us?
 And look through our eyes?

 Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
 Measure your coffin does it measure up to your lust?
 So I think I'll leave you
 With your bishops and your guilt
 So until the next time
 Have a good sin

 Only the good die young
 All the evil seem to live forever
 Only the good die young
 All the evil seem to live forever
 Only the good die young
 Only the good die young

 Seven deadly sins
 Seven ways to win
 Seven holy paths to hell

 Seven downward slopes
 Seven bloodied hopes
 Seven are your burning fires,
 Seven your desires ...

 Trace your way back 50 years
 To the Glow of Dresden - blood and tears
 In the black above by the cruel searchlight
 Men will die and men will fight - yeah!
 Who shot who and who fired first?
 Dripping death to whet the bloodthirst
 No radar lock on - skin and bone
 The bomber boys are going home

 Chorus:
 Climb into the sky never wonder why - Tailgunner
 You're a Tailginner
 (repeat)

 Nail that Fokker kill that son,
 Gonna blow your guts out with my gun,
 The weather forecast good for War
 Cologne and Frankfurt? have some more!
 Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
 The Enola Gay was my last try
 Now that this Tailgunner's gone
 No more Bombers (just one big bomb)

 Believe in me - send us money

 But my so called friends are making me a joke
 They missed out what I said like I never spoke
 They choose what they wanna hear - they don't tell a lie
 They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
 Saving your soul by taking your money
 Flies round shit, bees around honey.

 Chorus:
 Holy Smoke, Holy Smoke, plenty bad preachers for
 The Devil to stoke
 Feed 'em in feet first this is no joke
 This is thirsty work making Holy Smoke

 Jimmy Reptile and all his friends
 Say they gonna be with you at the end
 Burning records burning books
 Holy soldiers Nazi looks
 Crocodile smiles just wait a while
 Till the TV Queen gets her make up clean
 I've lived in filth I've lived in sin
 And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in

 Chorus:

 They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
 When Noah built his Cadillac it was cool
 Two by two they're still going down
 And the satellite circus just left town
 I think they're strange and when they're dead
 They can have a Lincoln for their bed
 Friend of the President - trick of the tail
 Now they ain't got a prayer - 100 years in jail

 Now There's something to bet on
 You've got nothing to see

 When I've sat by the window
 And gazed at the rain
 With an ache in my heart
 But never felling the pain
 And if you would tell me
 Just what my life means
 Walking a long road
 Never reaching the end

 Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins
 And the Press get fed the scapegoats

 Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
 Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove.

 A cunning fox in the chickens lair,
 A hound of hell and the devil don't care

 Running Silent, Running deep, we are your final prayer,
 Warrior in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,
 A silent death lies waiting, for all of you below,
 Running silent, Running deep, sink into your silent sleep

 Chill the hearts of fighting men,
 In open ocean wondering when?
 The lethal silver fish will fly
 The boat will shiver - men will die
 A cast of millions - a part to play
 Killer? Victim? or fool for a day
 Obeying an order - men have to die
 Us or them - a well rehearsed lie

 The tar black smell of burning oil,

 No patent remedies for heartache

 So get down on your knees honey
 Assume and attitude
 You just pray that I'll be waiting

 "I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity"

 Hell ain't a bad place

 She must be having one of her crazy dreams

 When it comes to the time
 We'll be ready to die

 God let us go now and finish what's to be done
 Thy Kingdom Come
 Thy shall be done ... on earth

 Try to justify to ourselves the reason to go
 Should we live and let live
 Forget or forgive

 But how can we let them go on this way?
 The reign of terror corruption must end
 And we know deep down there's no other way
 No trust, no reasoning, no more to say.

 Afraid to shoot strangers

 No hope, no life, just pain and fear
 No food, no love, just greed is here

 Starvation and the hunger
 The suffering and the pain
 The agonies of all-out war
 When will it come again?

 The struggle for the power
 A tyrant tries again
 Just what the hell is going now?
 When will it ever end?

 No hope, no life, just pain and fear
 No food, no love, just greed is here

 You see the full moon float
 You watch the red sun rise
 We take these things for granted

 Suspected of a hit that was my crime

 I am a fugitive being hunted down like game

 Always looking 'round me
 Forever looking back

 Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun

 You gotta keep an open mind
 But I hope that my life's not an open and shut case.

 Can the soul live on and travel through space and time?

 You don't be alarmed now
 If I try to contact you

 And when I'm walking a dark road
 At night or strolling through the park.
 
 When the light begins to change
 I sometimes feel a little strange
 A little anxious when it's dark.

 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
 I have constant fear that something's always near
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
 I have a phobia that someone's always there.

 Have you run your fingers down the wall
 And have you felt your neck skin crawl
 When you're searching for the light?
 Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
 At the corner of the room
 You've sensed that something's watching you.

 Have you ever been alone at night
 Thought you heard footsteps behind
 And turned around and no-one's there?
 And as you quicken up your pace
 You find it hard to look again
 Because you're sure there's someone there.

 Watching horror films the night before
 Debating witches and folklore
 The unknown troubles on your mind
 Maybe your mind is playing tricks
 You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
 On dancing shadows from behind.

 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

 Come to wash my sins away

 Standing alone in the wind and rain
 Feeling the fear that is growing
 Sensing the change in the tide again
 Brought by the storm that is brewing
 Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
 Some of the doubt in the things you believe
 Now that your faith will be put to the test
 Nothing to do but await what is coming

 Why then is God still protecting me
 Even when I don't deserve it
 Though I am blessed with an inner strength
 Some they would call it a penance
 Why am I meant to face this alone
 Asking the question time an again
 Praying to God won't keep me alive
 Inside my head feel the fear start to rise ...

 They'll be saving their prayers when the moment comes
 There'll be panance to pay when it's judgment day
 And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
 They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

 The sign of the cross
 The name of the rose .. a fire in the sky
 The sign of the cross
 
 They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
 They'll be bringing us all immortality
 Holding communion so the world be blessed
 Me creator, my God'll lay my soul to rest

 Lost the love of heaven above
 Chose the lust of the earth below

 I don't care for this world anymore
 I just want to live my own fantasy
 Fate has brought us to these shores
 What was meant to be is now happening

 I've found that I like this living in danger
 Living on the edge it makes feel as one
 Who cares now what's right or wrong it's reality
 Killing so we survive wherever we may roam
 Wherever we may hide we've got to get away

 I don't want existence to end
 We must prepare ourselves for the elements
 I just want to feel like we're wrong
 We don't need a code of morality

 I like all the mixed emotion and anger
 It brings out the animal the power you can feel
 And feeling so high on this much adrenalin
 Excited but scary to believe what we've become

 Saints and sinners
 Something within us
 We are lord of the flies

 Saints and sinners
 Something willing us

 TO BE LORD OF THE FLIES

 The freeway is jammed and it's backed up for miles
 The car is an oven and baking is wild
 Nothing is ever the way it should be
 What we deserve we just don't get you see

 A briefcase, a lunch and a manon the edge
 Each step gets closer to losing his head
 Is someone in heaven are they looking down
 'Cause nothing is fair just you look arround

 Falling down


 Falling down


 Falling down

 He's sick of waiting of lying like this
 There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
 Branded a leper because you don't fit
 In the land of the free you can live by your wits

 Once he built missiles a nation's defence
 Now he can't even give birthday presents
 Accross the city he leaves in his wake
 A glimpse of the future a cannibal state

 Falling down

 After the war and now that they've sent us homeward
 I can't help but feel that I'm on my own
 No one can see just what this conflict has done to
 The minds of the men who are on their way home

 I'm scarred for life but it's not my flesh that's wounded
 So how can I face the torment alone
 The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares
 I lay there and the sweat until it gets light ...

 People say 'don't worry'
 Say that time's a perfect healer
 That the nightmares they will come to pass
 Can't hear what they're saying
 I am living in my own world
 And I'm feeling trance-like all the time

 I hear voices in my hand
 Could I really be going crazy
 In the night the visions seem so real
 Do you care if you live or die
 When you laugh are you really crying
 You're not sure what's real anymore

 Fortunes of war
 Fortunes of war
 Fortunes of war no pain anymore
 Fortunes of war
 Fortunes of war
 Fortunes of war no pain anymore
 Fortunes of war
  
 Sometimes I wake
 I feel that my spirit's broken
 I wonder if I've the strength ... carry on

 CARRY ON.

 The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep
 Here comes the nightmare that never ends
 Here is the dream that makes monsters of men

 In the house of my soul
 In rooms of ugliness and cold
 Memories locked away
 All the doubts and fears I never faced

 Now the come again
 I am falling down to meet with them
 Fears within us all
 Mine awake and they stand up tall

 Look for the truth
 Deepest cut of all from you
 Knife of the truth
 Blade of hatred slicing through

 I pray my sleep will break
 Maybe this time I won't wake
 Weakness I hide so well
 This dagger in my mind will tell

 It's my final stand
 I make a fist out of each hand
 To shadows of the past
 Take a breath and I scream attack

 Look for the truth
 Deepest cut of all from you
 Knife of the truth
 Blade of hatred slicing through
 Here is the truth

 Silently to silence fall
 In the fields of futile war
 Toys of death are spitting lead
 Where boys that were our soldiers bled
 war horse and war machine

 Curse the name of liberty
 Marching on as if they should
 Mix in the dirt our brother's blood

 In the mud and rain
 What are we fighting for
 Is it worth the pain
 Is it worth dying for
 Who will take the blame
 Why did they make a war
 Questions that come again
 Should we be fighting at all

 Once a ploughman hitched his team
 Here he sowed his little dream
 Now bodies arms and legs are strewn
 Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
 Each moment's like a year
 I've nothing left inside for tears
 Comrades dead or dying lie
 I'm left alone asking why

 In the mud and rain
 What are we fighting for
 Is it worth the pain
 Is it worth dying for
 Who will take the blame
 Why did they make a war
 Questions that come again
 Should we be fighting at all

 After the war
 Left feeling no one has won
 After the war

 A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyone
 A silent prayer to God to help you on your way
 I've been depressed so long
 It's hard to remember when I was happy
 I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
 But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
 The hardest part is to get on with your life

 You're searching in the dark clutching at straws to find a way
 You take the Tarot cards and throw them to the wind
 You question your beliefs, your inner thoughts, your whole existance
 And if there is a God then answer if you will
 And tell me of my  fate, tell me of my place
 Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace

 If you could live your life again
 Would you change a thing or leave it all the same
 If you had the chance again
 Would you change a thing at all
 When you look back at your past
 Can you say that you are proud of what you've done
 Are there times when you believe
 That the right you thought was wrong

 All of my life now I have believed
 Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me

 All of my life now I have believed
 Judgement of Heaven awaits for me

 All of my life now I have believed
 Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me is waiting for me ...

 It's out of control
 Blood on The World's hand
 Each day a new toll

 Another assassination
 The same day a new creation
 But what are they coming into
 Security of a world that brings ...

 One day another killing
 Somewhere there's someone starving
 Another a savage raping
 Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us

 It's out of control
 Blood on The World's hand
 Each day it goes on

 Brutality and aggression
 Tomorrow another lesson
 Expecting another air raid
 Praying for a ceasfire ...

 They say things getting better
 No need to be complacent
 There's chaos across the border
 And one day it could be happening to us

 I've looked into the heart of darkness
 Where the blood-red journey ends
 When you've faced the heart of darkness
 Even your soul begins to bend

 For a week I have been waiting
 Still I am only in Saigon
 The walls move in a little closer
 I feel the jungle call me on

 Every minute I get weaker
 While in the jungle they grow strong
 What I wanted was a mission
 And for my sins they gave me one

 They brought it up just like room service
 'Cause everyone gets what they want
 And when that mission was all over
 I'd never want another one

 I know, captain, that you've done this work before
 Weve got a problem you can help us all I'm sure
 The colonel's gone rogue and his methods are unsound
 You'll take a PBR up river track him down

 There's a conflict in every human heart
 And the temptation is to take it all too far
 In this war things get so confused
 But there are some things which cannot be excused

 He's acting like a God - an insane lunatic
 Yout mission - exterminate with extreme prejudice
 The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow
 Here is the file and it's all you need to know

 Here I am the knife in my hand
 And now I understand why the genius must die

 Now I stand alone in the darkness
 With his blood upon my hands
 Where sat the warrior the poet
 Now lie the fragments of a man

 I've looked into the heart of darkness
 Where the blood-red journey ends
 When you've faced the heart of darkness
 Even your soul begins to bend.

 Hold on for something better that just drags you through the dirt
 Do you just let go or carry on and try to take the hurt

 All my life ... I've run astray
 Let my faith ... slip away

 Allowed my faith ... to drift away

 Are you worried just at what you'll find
 Do you really want to face the truth

 Forgive yourlself a few immortal sins
 Do yuo really care what people think

 There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
 Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
 The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite
 A menace to society, a social disease

 Rape of the mind is a social disorder
 The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

 Watching begginings of social decay
 Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
 Eating away at your own self esteem
 Pouncing on every word that you might be saying

 Rape of the mind is a social disorder
 The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

 Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
 As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned

 Rape of the mind is a social disorder
 The cynics, the apathy oneupmanship order

 Watching begginings of social disorder
 Gloating or sneering...at life's disarray

 When every good thing's laid to waste
 By all the jealousy and hate
 By all the acid wit and rapier lies

 And every time you think you're safe
 And when you go to turn away
 You know they're sharpening all their paper knives

 All in your mind
 All in your head
 Try to relate it

 All in your mind
 All in your head
 Try to escape it

 Without a conscience they destroy
 And that's a thing that they enjoy
 They're a sickness that's in all our minds

 They want to sink the ship and leave
 The way they laugh at you and me
 You know it happens all the time

 All in your mind
 All in your head
 Try to relate it

 All in your mind
 All in your head
 Try to escape it

 The rats in the cellar you know who you are....
 Or do you?

 Watching begginings of social decay.....

 Roll of the dice
 Take a spin of the wheel
 Out of your hands now
 So how do you feel
 but you're not gonna win
 You'd better go back again

 Do you feel lucky
 Or do you feel scared
 Take what luck brings
 And be Devil may care
 But you're down on your luck
 And what will the next day bring

 Adrift on the ocean
 Afloat in a daydream
 Or lost in a maze
 Or blind in the haze
 So what does it matter
 So why don't you answer
 So why did you send
 An angel to mend

 Best make decisions
 Before it's too late
 Take all your chances
 Take hold of the reins
 A roll of the dice
 Ahead of the game again

 Nothing to lose
 But so much to gain
 A little danger
 It goes without saying
 But what do you care
 You're gonna go in the end

 Gate open to Heaven
 Is ready and waiting
 Or straight down to hell
 Can go there as well

 I'll suffer my craving
 My soul's not worth saving
 So why don't you go
 Just leave well alone

 Don't you think I'm the saviour
 Don't you think I could save you
 Don't you think I could save your life (12x)

 There's like a hunger
 That knocks on your door
 You've had a taste of it
 Still you want more
 You've made your mistakes
 Won't play it the same again

 You have been warned
 But still you plunge in
 You play high stakes
 But there's nothing to win
 You've only one life
 And so many things to learn

 The Angel on one side
 The Devil on the other
 Which path do you take
 Decisions to make

 Arrive at the crossroads
 You know where you're going
 And what if you wait
 It may be too late

 Don't you think I'm the saviour
 Don't you think I could save you
 Don't you think I could save your life (10x)

 Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
 Feel something strong as the power draws near

 It is the rolling of thunder that scares you
 Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear
 But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
 It takes me back to my childhood again

 And as I wait and I look for an answer
 To all the things going round in my head
 I ask myself could it be a disaster and when
 it's maybe threatening to happen again

 As the ominous light draws near
 There's a lone dog howls in the park
 All the people hurry inside
 As a lightning flash lights dark
 The storm is nearly here
 Only God will know

 You're sitting alone you watch
 As the wind is blowing treetops
 And the swaying rustling of leaves
 Plenty of time to perceive
 As you wait for rain to fall
 Only God knows
 The whole sky glows

 Maybe lightning strikes twice

 Wake alone in the hills
 With the wind in your face
 It's good to be proud
 And be free and a race
 That is part of a clan
 And to live on highlands
 And the air that you breathe
 So pure and so clean

 When alone on the hills
 With the wind in your hair
 With a longing to feel
 Just to be free

 In the need to be free
 It's a time when you die

 Just a want to be free
 With a need to belong
 I am a clansman ..... Freedom (4x)

 It's a time wrought with fear
 It's a land wrought with change
 Ancestors could hear
 What is happening now
 They would turn in their graves
 They would all be ashamed
 That the land of the free
 Has been written in chains

 And I know what I want
 When the timing is right
 Then I'll take what is mine
 I am the clansman

 And I swear to defend
 And we'll fight to the end
 And I swear that I'll never

 And I know that we'll stand
 And we'll fight for our land
 And I swear that my bairns
 Will be born free

 Get a lifetime of experience
 Yeah I've got so much to give

 Open the gate at chapter one
 Could this just be that life's just begun
 Forever within your darker thoughts
 Reflecting on everything you've been taught

 Never felt this way before
 Seems that somebody's' just opened the door
 To the book of life .... or is it death
 Is there ever anyway out

 Someone's looking down on me
 To the very inner core of my soul
 They won't tell me what they see
 But I really want to know

 I want to leave my life on my own
 I want to lift the unturned stone
 I want to walk right into the fire
 I want to live out all my desires

 I want to go and see the fire burn
 I want to see and feel my world turn
 I want to know what more there's to learn
 I want to pass the point of no return

 Just another one statistic or feel
 That you really should aspire
 That you really do deserve more

 Do you ever really feel
 That you have so much potential inside
 What you really have to give
 Could be realised much more

 I want to meet my father beyond
 I want to walk right into the light
 I want to feel no fear but delight

 Como esta amigo
 For the death of those we don't know
 Shall we kneel and say a prayer
 They will never know we care
 Shall we keep the fires burning
 Shall we keep the flames alight
 Shall we try to remember
 What is wrong and what is right

 No more tears, no more tears
 If we live for a hundred years
 Amigos no more tears

 Ooo, oooooo .....

 If we do forget them and
 The sacrifice they made
 Will the wickedness and
 Sadness come to visit us again
 Shall we dance the dance in sunlight
 Shall we drink the wine of peace
 Shall our tears be of joy
 Shall we keep at bay the beast

 No more tears, no more tears
 If we live for a hundred years
 Amigos no more tears

 Ooo, oooooo .....

 Inside the scream is silent
 Inside it must remain
 No victory and no vanquished
 Only horror, only pain

 No more tears, no more tears
 If we live for a hundred years
 Amigos no more tears

 No more tears, no more tears
 If we live for a hundred years
 Amigos no more tears

 Many evil nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere
 We all got to try the Black Bart blues

 Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems
 Black Bart's lookin'
 Don't know where she's been
 Maybe she's an acrobat
 Spends her evenings dancing on a pole
 We all got to try the Black Bart blues

 Black Bart tried most anything
 Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing
 So he asked me to tell ya
 Try it for yourself and you will see

 Nerd  'I'm sorry, I just..., I guess I'm not used to...
 Bruce 'Shut up and get on with it will you'

 Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now
 Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow
 So if you are a dancer,
 You could dance his pole in May
 That's a maypole

 Black Bart's coming
 Now Black Bart's gone
 Black Bart did it so I wrote this song
 Whatever and however,
 In and out or several at a time mmm yes!
 We all got to do the Black Bart blues
 Here comes the guitar solo

 We all got to try the Black Bart blues

 Who would be a poor man a beggerman, a thief
 if he had a rich man in his hand
 Who would steal the candy from a laughing baby's mouth
 if he could take it from the money man

 Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again
 She signs no contract but she always plays the game
 She dines in Hampstead village on expense accounted gruel
 and the jack knife barber drops her off at school

 Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys
 would rather make it with a letching gray
 Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung
 who watches through the railings as they play

 Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along.
 She's a poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song
 She's a rich man's stealer but her favour's good and strong
 She's the Robin Hood of Highgate helps the poor man get along

 No one has the courage to put them away
 Nobody has any faith
 'Cause there's a breakdown of justice and order

 Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
 Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace

 When I remember back the memories of yesteryear
 (they really say 'yesterday')
 With all the friends and all the times
 When people were carefree
 And walking down the street
 When everyone knew everyone
 And all the houses doors were open
 No had to care those days are gone
 Those days are gone

 Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
 Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace

 I long for the times when you could
 Wander down the street unharmed
 When poeple didn't have much money
 But didn't seem to care
 It must be the cynic in me
 But I don't really like things now
 The violence, the attitudes
 Aggression that you see everyday
 A sick society looks the other way.

 There goes the bandolero
 Through the hole in the wall
 He's a coward but doesn't care though
 In fact, he doesn't care at all

 The general that's commanding
 He's defending what he fears
 While the troops they are depending
 On reinforcements from the rear

 If God is in the heavens
 How can this happen here?
 In His name, they used the weapons
 For the massacre

 There is a point below zero
 Where the sun can see the land
 Six hundred unknown heroes

 But that´s where he get his pork pie
 Limos and ladies they´re driving him crazy
 Rugby and cricket's unknown
 Baseball and football they´re making him lazy
 Your fan club says "Rodney come´ome"

 The Sheriff of Huddersfield
 Locked in his castle
 Looked down on the Hollywood Hills
 The Sheriff of Huddersfield
 Locked in his castle
 You're our own Hot Rod on wheels

 A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
 The Nautilus rusts in the yard
 For Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning
 He'll always live in L.A.
 A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
 And never comes out to pay bills
 He's winning at poker and playing the Joker
 And always cheats when he deals

 Hello, let me introduce myself
 My name's Rodney
 I'm immensely strong
 When I were a lad
 I could lift up
 Five navies on the end of a shovel
 The reason I never took up martial arts
 Is because I was fearsome
 And probably
 Kill everybody
 That I came into contact with
 I was phenomenally strong

 Pride and ego
 My lads,
 Pride and ego
 Is what makes the world rotate,
 And everybody knows that
 The centre of the Universe is Huddersfield
 That's why I don't live there anymore
 I live in Los Angeles
 It's great!... I think

 Rufus the red has a crane by his bed
 To wrench himself up in the morn'
 But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed
 You´ll wish you'd never been born
 A bear with a sore head we don´t mean your forehead
 He slumbers for most of the day
 Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast
 Your problem Rodney is L.A.

 The sin shines all night!

 Start, with the sun
 And move on out
 The future's in the skies above
 The heavens unfold
 And a new star is born
 Space and time makin' love

 Chorus:
 Oh what a time we had
 Living on the ground
 I've moved to station #5
 See you next time around,
 Next time around

 As far you want, as close as you need
 It's all in the mind, you know
 This old world hasn't really seen it's day
 It's here, time to go

 Chorus

 Remember when it was so clear
 We were young, but the memory still remains
 To pick fruit from a tree
 Fish from the seas
 Now nothing's left here, but the stains
 Well I can't cry no more
 Can only be glad
 There's other places we can be
 If the time suits you right
 I'm leaving tonight
 Come fly away
 With me!
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
 Oh, yeah

 Start, with the sun
 And move on out
 The future's in the skies above
 The heavens unfold
 A new star is born
 Space and time makin' love

 Hold her in your arms don't let go

 Hold her in your arms don't let go

 That girl you need
 Gonna knock you off your feet
 That girl, you know
 She'll never let you go

 CHORUS:
 That girl, That girl, That girl you need
 That girl, That girl, That girl, That girl

 Can you hear her call, call out your name
 Think about you, cry without you
 Hold her in your arm
 Don't let go

 Fight and win, never give in
 Hold her in your arms don't let go

 Cold as steel the darkness waits, it's hour will come
 A cry of fear for the chosen worshipping the sun
 Mother natures black revenge on those who waste her life
 War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice

 CHORUS:
 Sunrise is gone, freezing up the fires
 Sunrise is gone, numbing all desires
 Sunrise is gone, Sunrise is gone

 Around the world the people stop with terror-stricken eyes
 A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
 In the icy rain and whiplashed seas there's nowhere left to run
 The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane

 REPEAT CHORUS

 Around the world the nations wait
 for some wise words from their leading light
 You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
 "Is this the end" the millions cried
 clutching their riches as they died
 Those who survive must weather the storm

 SOLO

 Gone are the days when man looked down
 They've taken away his sacred crown
 To be so free, it took so long
 It's not the journeys end, it's just begun

 Beehive hairdo, 45 on the hip
 Patrolwoman Saunders, don't you give her no whip
 Took me to the station for a breathtest
 then back to the bedroom for some house-arrest

 CHORUS:
 Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
 Women in uniform, but, Oh! They feel so warm

 Coming back to London on a 747
 Stewardess made me feel like I'm in heaven
 Looking up the aisle to see what I could see
 She leaned over said; Give it to me

 White apron, brown leather shoes
 The nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
 Gave me a massage, sprained my right
 Now she takes my temperature every night

 REPEAT CHORUS

 Women in uniform, Women in uniform
 Women in uniform, Women in uniform

 Commando raid on the Lebanese border
 Sergeant Anita, she gives the order
 Khaki jacket and a love gun
 Baby, I surrender, let's have some fun

 In a flat Forty-One with my strat on the door
 we was goin' to the country for what we came for.
 I'm sure you've smelled the trees in the air.
 The best of motor cruisin's just the joy to get there.

 I was approachin' Simonton down by the cotton gin.
 There was old man Berkman trying to flag me in.
 He asked if I would stay awhile and if I needed gas.
 I said, "No thanks, anyhow I don't drive too fast."

 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 ride my Chevrolet.
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 ride my Chevrolet.

 I took the road down to Cinco
 through that red Brazos River land,
 done hit that freeway at sunset.
 Now the big city lights are at hand.

 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 ride my Chevrolet.

 Symphony no. 9 in D minor, opus 125, fourth movement

                                  (translation by Paul Brians)
 Freude, schöner Götterfunken     Joy, lovely divine light,
 Tochter aus Elysium              Daughter of Elysium
 Wir betreten feuertrunken,       We march, drunk with fire,
 Himmlische, dein Heiligtum.      Holy One, to thy holy kingdom.
 Deine Sauber binden wieder,      Thy magic binds together
 Was die Mode streng geteilt;     What tradition has strongly parted,
 Alle Menschen werden Brüder,     All men will be brothers
 Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.    Dwelling under the safety of your wings.

 I've been gone a long long time, waiting for you
 I din't want to see you go
 And now it's hurting so much, what can I do?
 I wanted you to be my wife
 The days are passing slowly, since you've gone
 Your memories are all I have
 I sit here waiting but you'll never show
 Without you I can't carry on

 You said you'd always love me,all of my life
 And then you said your last goodbye
 Why the sudden change, why all the lies,
 I should have seen it in your eyes
 The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you
 My summer love has turned to rain
 The silent emptiness of one sided love
 My life means nothing now you're gone...

@node "Trieste"

 p.s. this is my small review of Trieste '98 concert, posted
      specially for "Iron Maiden Purgatory Newsletter"...

 Here's my small review of the yesterday's (6th of May) concert
 in Italy (Trieste). Me & my friend Luka (around 10 years younger
 than me, hehe) go to that concert via travel agency POORKY's CONCERT.
 The price was around 80 DEM (bus travel + ticket). We left our
 capital city Ljubljana (56km of my home city - Zagorje ob Savi).
 We travel around two hours to get in Trieste (the town is placed
 almost in the border between Italy and Slovenia). The concert must be
 been in the soccer stadium, but they moved it to the small basketball
 hale (not enough ticket sold?; must be). Well, I count somewhere
 around 3500-4000 people (my ticket has number 3025). The concert
 starts around 19h (rather lather) with DIRTY DEEDS, which I don't
 know really well (also music is not my favourite). They played
 around half hour. Then they come on stage HELLOWEEN. They played
 9 tracks (I don't know all of them, because I own only first three
 of four albums: Eagly Fly Free, Dr.Stein, ?, Push (?), We Can... (?).
 Time Of The Oath, We Got The Right (?), ?, and How Many Tears.
 (? = new tracks from latest album which I don't know). After the
 Helloween, OFCOURSE, people go nuts (!). :-) "Maiden!, Maiden!,
 Maiden!, Maiden!, Maiden!...". The concert starts with some
 instrumental music (remember Metallica intro on '92 Tour?).

 Well, here is Setlist (I'm 100% about that, because I was writting
 this on small piece of paper during the whole concert, hehehe):

 --. Intro <some kind of 'braveheart' music>
 01. Futureal
 02. The Angel And The Gambler
 03. Man On The Edge
 04. Lightning Strikes Twice
 05. Heaven Can Wait
 06. The Clansman
 07. When Two Worlds Collide
 08. Lord Of The Flies
 09. 2 Minutes To Midnight
 10. The Educated Fool
 11. Sign Of The Cross
 12. Hallowed Be Thy Name
 13. Afraid To Shoot Strangers
 14. The Evil That Men Do
 15. The Clairvoyant
 16. Fear Of The Dark
 17. Iron Maiden
     <here they left stage for about 3-4 minutes> & for BIS they played:
 18. The Number Of The Beast
 19. The Trooper
 20. Sanctuary

 ... between "14", Eddie come on stage with soccer dress
 "Virtual 11" & kicks major ass & between "17", Eddie (just
 like on the V11 album cover) was 'blown' up to the Nickos drums,
 and two hands was 'blowned' on the left/right of the stage
 (this 'effect' was known on the Somewhere in Tour '86; I see
 already that; look "Stranger on the strange land" video clip
 and you will see how it looks; COOL!, hehehe). Well, I don't
 know how long was the show, but I say more than two hours.
 I sang to every song, and today I got really 'nasty' sound
 out of my throat (hehehe).

 p.s. between "9" (as I already said, I'm born exactly at 23:58;
 REALLY!), friend Luka gave me up to his shoulder & go pretty nuts
 this time (hahaha), but security guards went crazy and show me
 with his hands that I must go down, but I remain on his shoulder
 almost to the end of the song (yeah!).

 After the concert I buy one t-shirt with special BOTB cover
 (words VIRTUAL XI is added on the shirt). & the back:
 Virtual XI WORLD TOUR, IRON MAIDEN, HELLOWEEN & DIRTY DEEDS
 logos, and some Italy Tour dates. I pay around 15 DEM for
 this one. I but also VIRTUAL XI poster (just like the album
 cover). This costs me around 10 DEM.

 Ohh, I forgot to say that: (MUST SAY) I saw Maiden for the six (6)
 times (86, 90, 92, 95, 96 & now 98) and I agree that this one is
 far better than first two I saw with Blaze (no compare with
 Dickinson, he is really FAR, FAR better then He). Blaze is now
 better with singing (far better), and also on the stage he is
 more active (more contact to the people) that on last tour. & what
 to say about Harris, Murray, Gers & McBrain?  No other word than:
 >>> FANTASTIC !!! <<<  :)

 Well, that's it. I hope you enjoy reading this. :-)

 UP THE VIRTUAL IRONS!

@node "Soundhouse Tapes"

 @{b}History of the Soundhouse Tapes@{ub}

 In the book RUNNING FREE Gary Bushell writes:

     (page 18)

     Recording their own demo tape was one sure way to blag gigs
     outside the East End, and as Steve Harris was impressed by a demo
     Den Wilcock and Terry Wapram's new band V1 had recorded at the
     Spacewod Studios in Cambridge, Maiden decided to follow suit. It
     was dearer than a lot of local studios, but Harry realised that
     recording on the cheap was false economy. Old Year's night 1978
     was the only time they could get booked, so they took it even
     though they had nowhere up there to stay. Thankfully Di'Anno's
     romantic charms (it sez here) won the day when he pulled a young
     nurse in the boozer and this selfless Florence Nightingale solved
     the problem by inviting the whole motley crew back to a New
     Year's knees-up where, several sherberts later, they merrily
     crashed out. That first two day session set them back £200. They
     managed to record four Steve Harris compositions, Iron Maiden,
     Invasion, Prowler and Strange World and left with the intention
     of going back a couple of weeks later when they had more cash to
     flash, to polish them off, re-do the odd bum note, do a spot of
     remixing and so forth. However they didn't have enough readies at
     the time to buy the master tape, so when they did get back there
     they found the studio had wiped the master clean! So the demo
     tape which eventually made it onto vinyl was exactly the way it
     was recorded that 'taters New Year's Eve - and a fine testimony
     to Maiden's early ability that it still sounded, and indeed still
     sounds, so raw, cocksure and barbed wire catchy.

     Soon after they took it to Neal kay, the DJ/HM Godfather who
     ruled the rowdy roost at the Heavy Metal Soundhouse in Kingsburym
     and a whole new chapter in their carrieer opened.


     (page 23)

     Neal Kay recalls very well the afternoon Dave Murray brought him
     in a copy of the demo, that was soon to become known as The
     Soundhouse Tapes, to try and blag a gig. "I said 'Oh yeah'," Kay
     laughs, "'You and five million others.' I told him to leave it
     and maybe I'd get a chance to hear it a couple of weeks later. I
     really hate myself on that!"

     But when he did play it, Kay immediately appreciated the power
     and the potential of the band. "I almost fell over," he grins. "I
     was running and screaming round the lounge like a lunatic. I just
     couldn't stop playing it. The next day I phoned Steve Harris at
     work and said to him 'You've got something here that could make
     you a lot of money'. And he laughed at me. He thought I was
     kidding!"

     It was obvious to Kay that Maiden had something money couldn't
     buy - poverty. No, really he was impressed by a combination of
     things. "For a start it was a pretty together demo", he remebers.
     "There were a few bum notes, but Steve and co had realised that
     you need to use a decent studio. They hadn't wasted time, they
     had gone in and worked hard. And the whole package was put
     together amazingly well. They'd obviously thought it out to the
     best of their ability at the time. And musically it was
     staggering. It was the melody plus power that impressed me.
     Aggressive bands have been a dime a dozen since. But no one since
     has had the tunes too. The combination of power, speed, the key
     changes, the melody, and Dave Murray's melody lines bowled me
     over, It was very unique and very impressive. Definitely the most
     impressive demo I'd ever had delivered to me."

     Maybe it was the way Harry wrote the songs that gave them their
     distinct flavour. All the demo songs were written on the bass
     rather than the guitar which obviously gives them a different
     feel and they were composed in pieces and then put together in
     the manner of most Maiden material. But whatever the band's 'X'
     factor [sic! //toka] was, it spelt excitement and exhilaration
     for everyone who saw or heard of them. Kay began playing the
     band's demo immediately, and no one was more surprised than
     Maiden when Prowler turned up in the Sounds HM chart supplied by
     the Soundhouse at no 20 in the 17 February '79 issue. (Kay had
     been sending in a weekly chart since '78 and like everything he
     did to do with metal, he took it very seriously, basing it
     strictly on requests from the kids who regularly attended the
     Soundhouse).


     (page 34)

     On 9 November, because of mounting interest among Britain's
     mayhem merchants, Maiden decided to release three unremixed tracks
     from the Soundhouse Tapes - Prowler, Invasion and Iron maiden -
     as an EP on their own label, Rock Hard Records, pressing just
     5000 copies. They used one of Loonhouse's shots on the front and
     cheekily used Chris Harler's contacts on the back (no, Rod never
     paid him) along with some suitably messianic sleevenotes from the
     Prophet Kay. He wrote:

     "Every so often, one special band emerges from the mass of
     untried and unknown hopefuls which fill the streets of the Rock
     World. Iron Maiden is just one such band, bringing with their
     emergence a style of rock music so hard, gritty and honest in its
     delivery that only success can justify their hard toil! The
     tracks on this E.P. were the first ever recorded by the band and
     are the authentic unremixed cuts taken from the demo tape
     recorded at Spacewood [sic //toka] studios in Cambridge on
     December 30th 1978, and subsequently presented to the Soundhouse
     a week later. After one hearing it was obvious that Iron Maiden
     would become one of the leaders of present day heavy metal,
     combining the sort of talent and hard drive that the music world
     must not ever ignore."

     Blimey! It still brings a tear to the eye to this very day (if
     you happen to be peeling an onion at the time...)

     Steve Harris actually hand-drew all the rest, including the
     label. The Soundhouse Tapes, as the EP was christened, never went
     on retail sale, but was distributed by Keith Wilfort and his mum
     from their house in Beaconsfield Rd, East Ham. They shifted 3000
     copies in the first week alone which gives you some idea of the
     demand. If fact Rod got calls from major retail chains like HMV
     and Virgin trying to order vast quantities, 20000 got ordered by
     the chains in one week, and although the resulting cash would
     have come in very nicely, Rod refused to supply the records
     because the band wanted to keep the ep as something special, for
     the hardest of the hardcore fans only.

 Iron Maiden
 Running Free
 The Official Story Of Iron Maiden
 By Garry Bushell and Ross Halfin Zomba Books
 ISBN 0 946391 50 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Bob McGrath wrote about the birth of this EP in Record Collector #98:

     (Reprinted without permission)

     [...]
     A turning point in their fortunes came with the opening of Neal
     Kay's Soundhouse Club in London which specialised in HM. Kay
     organised a concert at the Music Machine in May 1979 to showcase
     some of the best of the new U.K. outfits and Iron Maiden were put
     on a bill which also featured Samson and Angel Witch. Among the
     songs performed that night were "Invasion", "Iron Maiden" and
     "Prowler". These three songs had actually been recorded on New
     Year's Eve 1978 at Spaceward Studios, Cambridge as a demo, and
     the tape soon became a favourite at the Soundhouse. At the time,
     the line-up had settled with bassist Steve harris, Dave Murray on
     guitar, Doug Samson (drums) and vocalist Paul Di'anno.

     Sadly, when the tape appeared as an EP towards the end of 1979,
     it suffered slightly from muddy sound quality. The reason for
     this was that the group couldn't afford to buy the master tape in
     time before the studio engineer scrubbed it. As a result, the
     record had to pressed from a cassette copy. Issued on the group's
     own Rock hard label, "The Soundhouse Tapes" EP was distributed by
     mail order and at gigs. Although the group boasted at the time of
     sales of 15000, this was just an P.R. exercise; in fact they
     could only afford to press 5000 and consequently copies now
     [1987] change hands for £40.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In Record Collector #203 Matthias Mader mentions The Soundhouse Tapes
 in his article about NWoBHM collectables:

     (Reprinted without permission)

     [...]
     The band refused to kowtow to industry demands, however,
     preferring to stick to their original run of 5000 copies, thus
     gifting their most loyal fans with a disc that very quickly
     became the first NWoBHM collectable. (In fact, imported coloured
     counterfeits were pressed a couple of years later to satisfy the
     demand, followed by a pressing best identified by its glossier,
     lighter-shade-of-red sleeve.)

 In the same article, there is a listing of "The top 50 NWoBHM rarities,
 Part I: The Classics". In that listing, the current [1996] value estimate
 for a mint copy of The Soundhouse Tapes is £70.

@node "Description"

 @{b}IRON MAIDEN: The Soundhouse Tapes (release date: 10th November 1979)@{ub}

 The Soundhouse Tapes is probably the most wanted collector's item when
 it comes down to Maiden records. Sadly enough, the bootleggers have also
 realised this, therefore there are a lot of fake The Soundhouse Tapes
 copies floating around the collector's circuit. Some of these copies are
 actually pretty close to the original release.


 @{b}The Soundhouse Tapes, the FULL (full?) description@{ub}

 Material of cover: The cover is made out of a heavy kind of paper
 (a light version of cardboard) and it opens from the top.


 Front of cover:
 ---------------
 Colour: Dark orange or light red;
 Logo: Black letters, 'Iron' is written above 'Maiden', the logo is
       centered above the picture (the words 'Iron' and 'Maiden' are
       both left aligned in the center);
 Picture: The front cover has a colour picture of a live performance,
          it shows the singer (is Paul?) with his left fist raised and
          holding a microphone in his right hand, also on the background
          you can see either one of the guitar players or Steve;
 Title: At the bottom of the sleeve the words The Soundhouse Tapes are
        written in a calligraphed manner.

 Back of cover:
 --------------
 Colour: The back of the cover is in the same colour as the front. 
 Pictures: At the top of the cover one can find 5 pictures, from left to
           right they are: Doug Sampson, Dave Murray, Paul Di'anno,
           Steve Harris and a picture showing a stage shot (it's an
           unclear picture showing the drumkit along with the background
           of the stage). The corresponding names of the persons on the
           pictures are written underneath the pictures as I've typed
           them above, the names are printed in a handwritten fashion
           and nothing is written under the fifth picture. At the bottom
           5 more pictures have been printed, being from left to right:
           Maiden 'eadbangers (first picture), Live shots from the Music
           Machine. (the next three pictures) and Rob Loonhouse. The text
           as I've written it above is exactly the way it appears under
           the pictures, again the text is hand-written. All pictures
           which appear on the back are black and white pictures.

 History: Neal Kay has hand-written a small story about Iron Maiden,
 the exact text says: Every so often, one special band emerges from the
 mass of untried and unknown hopefuls which fill the streets of the Rock
 World. Iron Maiden is JUST one such band, bringing with their emergence,
 a style of Rock Music, so hard, gritty and honest in its delivery that
 only success can justify their hard toil!
 The tracks on this E.P. were the first ever recorded by the band and
 are the authentic unremixed cuts taken from the demo tape recorded at
 Spaceward studios in Cambridge on December 30th 1978, and, subsequently
 presented to me in The Soundhouse a week later.
 After one hearing it was obvious that Iron Maiden would become one of
 the leaders of present day heavy metal, combining the sort of talent
 and hard drive that the music world must not ever ignore. Neal Kay.

 NOTES:
 It's quite unclear when the letters were meant to be capitalised or not
 (because of Neal's funny handwriting), so I may have made an error or two
 concerning that, also the word must (in the last sentence) is underlined
 and the same goes for Neal's signature.

 Song listing: On the right of Neal's text one finds a double line
 separating Neal's text from the track listing, on the right of this
 line the following text appears:

 SIDE 1
 Iron Maiden

 SIDE 2
 1. Invasion
 2. Prowler

 Front photo:- Live at the H.M. Soundhouse Kingsbury, taken by Rob Loonhouse.
 Back photos by Chris Harler.
 Label + Sleeve design + artwork by Steve Harris.
 This record is dedicated to Maiden fans everywhere

 ROCK HARD
 RECORDS
 Rok. 1.

 NOTES:
 Both instances of the word 'side' (along with the corresponding numbers,
 i.e. 1 resp. 2) are printed capitalised in a small font. The song titles
 are written in the same calligraphed fashion as the title on the front of
 the sleeve. The text starting at 'Front photo..' until '.. fans everywhere'
 is written in the same handwriting as the text under the pictures (this is
 a different handwriting than Neal's). The words 'ROCK HARD' are written in
 a thinnish font and these words are actually a bit larger than the word
 'RECORDS'. The words 'Rok. 1.' are, again, handwritten.

 The record itself:
 The vinyl: The vinyl itself is just a regular black version.
 The paper: The paper which contains the side's description is nearly the
 same colour as the sleeve of the single, it's slightly darker, though.

 Side 1:
 Above the hole in the center: It has the following text above the hole in
 the middle:
 All rights of the manufacturer and of the owner of the recorded work
 reserved (NOTE: this is written in a curved manner along the upper half
 of the round-shaped paper)

 IRON MAIDEN (NOTE: this is the regular logo it appears centered on
 the paper, the words Iron and Maiden are left aligned with respect to
 one another)
 The Soundhouse Tapes (NOTE: this is written in the same calligraphed
 style as it was on the front of the sleeve);

 Left the hole in the center:

 SIDE 1

   45

  RPM

 NOTES:
 SIDE 1 is, again hand-written, 45 and RPM appear in boldface letters and
 45 is bigger than RPM


 Right of the hole in the center:

 (P) 1979 Rock Hard Records Ltd

 Sanctuary Music Ltd

 NOTES: All of the text on the right of the hole is hand-written

 Below the hole in the center:
 Iron Maiden (NOTE: calligraphed)
 (Steve Harris) (NOTE: handwritten)
 Produced By Iron Maiden (NOTE: handwritten)
 ROCK HARD (NOTE: big 3-D letters)
 RECORDS (NOTE: calligraphed)
 ROK 1 (NOTE: handwritten)
 unauthorised public performance broadcasting and copying
 of this record prohibited

 NOTE:
 This is written in a curved manner along the lower half of the round-shaped
 paper, also the distance between the words 'record' and 'prohibited' is
 bigger than the distance between the other words;

 Etchings on the vinyl in the run-off area: *EG*, SA, and ROK-1-A. There is
 also a very faint etching which I think is LYN 7627-IT.

 NOTE: These etchings have been provided by Chris Payne, who took them
 from an original copy.


 Side 2:

 Above the hole in the center: Idem as on side 1
 Left of the hole in the center:

 SIDE 2

   45

  RPM

 NOTES: SIDE 2 is, again hand-written, 45 and RPM appear in boldface
 letters and 45 is bigger than RPM

 Right of the hole in the center:
 (P) 1979 Rock Hard Records Ltd.

 Sanctuary Music Ltd.

 NOTES: All of the text on the right of the hole is hand-written,
 the only difference with side 1 is that on side 2 both sentences are
 concluded with a period, it seems that the 2nd sentence on side 1 also
 has a period (which is very hard to make out) but the first sentence
 certainly doesn't end with a period

 Below the hole in the center:
 Invasion - Prowler (NOTE: calligraphed)
 (Steve Harris)  (Steve Harris) (NOTE: handwritten)
 Produced By Iron Maiden (NOTE: handwritten)
 ROCK HARD (NOTE: big 3-D letters)

 NOTE: 
 This is written in a curved manner along the lower half of the round-shaped
 paper, also the distance between the words 'record' and 'prohibited' is
 bigger than the distance between the other words;

 Etchings on the vinyl in the run-off area: *EG*, SA, and ROK-1-B.
 There is also a very faint etching which I think is 7628-IT.

 NOTE: These etchings have been provided by Chris Payne, who took them

 In 1999, Iron Maiden is a household-name in every part of the world.
 After 20 years and almost 50 million album sales, Maiden is now rightly
 regarded as the 'classic' rock band in every sense: modern masters of
 that most emotionally extreme and technically dazzling form of rock music
 - the black sheep they call heavy metal. A genre Maiden single-handedly
 reinvented for the Eighties, when they released their first single,
 the punk-metal collision, 'Running Free', and their uncompromisingly
 raw debut album, 'Iron Maiden', in 1980. And a genre which is once again
 currently enjoying a vast renaissance worldwide with Maiden very much
 involved as always.

 Back in the early eighties, Maiden was the band at the forefront of the
 New Wave Of British Heavy Metal - a short-lived media-led phenomenon that
 would propel them onto the world stage. "People always used to call us
 punk-metal when we first started getting reviewed in the music papers in
 Britain," bassist and founding member, Steve Harris, recalls with a rueful
 smile. "But I think that was partly to do with the fact that our singer
 then, Paul Di'Anno, had quite short hair and the fact that we used to
 play so fast. We used to come across as really aggressive. But that was
 never really a punk thing to me - that was a pure metal thing. We used
 to frighten the life out of the punks·"

 Despite receiving no radio play whatsoever, 'Running Free' their debut
 single leapt into the UK Top 40. When the band were then offered their
 first appearance on Top Of The Pops, the UK's biggest weekly TV chart
 show, Maiden refused to do it unless they were allowed to play live
 - something no artist had done on Top Of The Pops since The Who
 demolished the studio during a performance of their 'Quadrophenia'
 hit, '5.15', in 1972. The BBC execs were sceptical but eventually
 relented and such precocity was rewarded when their debut album,
 'Iron Maiden', was released a few weeks later and immediately crashed
 into the UK albums chart at No.4!

 It was this take-no-prisoners attitude the band started with, and still
 adopt to this day, which has served them so well throughout their career.
 Since then, every one of the 11 studio albums and three live albums that
 Maiden have released have been major Top 10 successes both at home in
 the UK and more than 25 other countries around the world, including over
 20 hit singles - a fact that sometimes gets overlooked as so few of them
 have ever been played on radio - and no less than five consecutive
 million-selling albums in America.

 Along the way, despite numerous line-up changes the quintessential
 Maiden sound - the rumbling-earth bass, searchlight guitars, spatter-gun
 drums and lion's roar vocals - remained mercifully undimmed throughout.
 Their second album "Killers" followed in 1981 which saw the band paying
 first time tour visits to America, Canada and Japan. The album achieved
 the band gold album status around the world but at the end of the tour
 singer Paul Di Anno left heralding the arrival of Bruce Dickinson.

 1982 was to exceed all expectations for the new line up. After a couple
 of warm up shows with Bruce the band went in to record the legendary
 "Number of The Beast" album. This blew away all competition to enter
 the UK Chart at No.1 while the classic Maiden track, "Run To The Hills",
 got the band their first UK Top 10 single. This success was mirrored
 across Europe and also the American charts. The gruelling 180 date,
 8 month 'Beast on The Road Tour' again broke new ground for the band
 as they did shows in Australia and New Zealand and saw the band headline
 their first sold out US Show at the New York Palladium proving a portent
 of things to come. Once again there was a band casualty with Clive Burr,
 the bands drummer, leaving to make way for the now infamous drummer/
 prankster/headcase Nicko McBrain.

 The band immediately started work on Piece Of Mind which they recorded
 in Nassau in the Bahamas. The album went in the UK charts at No.3 when
 the band started their "World Piece Tour" in the UK. As before there
 was to be no let up in pace and Maiden found themselves playing to larger
 and larger audiences selling out everywhere and gathering more momentum
 in America with their first - of many - full scale arena headline tour.
 Powerslave was recorded in Nassau in 1985. The "Slavery Tour" was to give
 fans a massive stageshow of lights and production featuring Eddie, the
 bands hugely popular mascot and icon, now being transformed from a walk
 on part to a huge twenty foot mechanised monster. The groundbreaking tour
 started behind the Iron Curtain in Poland which was the first time a major
 band had taken full western production behind the Iron Curtain. By the
 third week of the tour the album itself was released, going straight in
 the UK Album Charts at No.2.

 The band found themselves breaking records everywhere playing the Rock
 In Rio Festival to 200,000 fans, selling out Radio City Hall in New York
 five nights running (illness preventing it from reaching seven) and the
 first act ever to sell out Long Beach Arena (Capacity 13000) for 4
 consecutive nights. This Long Beach success was captured in the bands
 next release "Live After Death", Maidens first Double Live album and
 video of the same name. The Live album charted at No.2 and the video
 went to No.1 in the video charts and remained there for some time.
 These releases are still regarded by many as one of the best live
 albums/videos of all time.

 "Somewhere in Time" was released in September 1986, this time recorded
 in both Nassau and Munich. This album marked a slight change in their
 style with the inclusion of keyboards for the first time but in no way
 diluted Maidens classic style. The first single released off the album
 "Wasted Years" reached the UK top twenty and was a track written about
 the rigours of their previous tours. The album continued to go gold or
 platinum in practically every major territory. The live show as before
 was a dazzling spectacle. The highlight featured Eddie, this time an
 understage inflatable and portrayed as a cyborg from the cover artwork,
 lifting the band off the stage with his two hands and sending Nicko and
 drumkit skywards balanced on his head. "Somewhere On Tour" again started
 in Eastern Europe and included six sell out nights at the Hammersmith
 Odeon before again spending the spring of 1987 touring through the US
 and finishing in Japan some eight months later.

 1988 brought "Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son", Maidens' first and only
 concept album. This wasn't the original idea at the outset, but in
 writing and followed by rehearsals it seemed the material had a common
 theme running through out. The first single "Can I Play With Madness"
 went to No.3 in the UK Charts and was followed by 3 other singles from
 the album all reaching the Top 10 - quite a feat without Radio support.
 The "Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour" saw them begin in the US. The high
 spot of the tour was to be the headlining of the legendary "Monsters Of
 Rock Festival" at Castle Donington which with support by the likes of
 Kiss, Dave Lee Roth, Guns and Roses and stablemates Helloween, they
 played to a all time record breaking 107,000 fans. The "Monsters"
 festival also had repeated success in Europe after which the band
 continued back to the UK to complete the tour with sell out shows at
 Wembley Arena for 2 nights, the Birmingham NEC 2 nights and 4 nights
 at the Hammersmith Odeon.

 The band had previously decided to take the whole of 1989 off however,
 unable to rest, Bruce and Adrian spent their time recording their first
 solo albums and November 1989 saw the group team up again for the launch
 of the "Maiden England" video. In January 1990 work had barely begun on
 the "No Prayer For The Dying" album when Adrian decided to leave the band,
 this being their first personnel change for some seven years. Bruce
 meanwhile had been working through the previous summer with ex-Gillan
 and White Spirit guitarist, Janick Gers who after auditioning was invited
 to join.
 
 The new line-up recorded the album in the UK at Steve's own Barnyard
 studio. Released October 1st the album entered the UK Chart at No.2.
 This album was to finally bring the band their first elusive No.1
 single with "Bring Your Daughter to The Slaughter" going straight
 to No.1 for Christmas 1990.

 Work on "Fear on The Dark" started early in 1992 and Eddie went through
 a transformation as for the first time artist Derek Riggs did not supply
 the cover art but instead the band took a more sinister image drawn by
 Melvin Grant. "Fear Of The Dark" was to be the bands third No.1 album
 and with an elaborate show the band hit the road again starting this
 time in Scandanavia. Again the opportunity to play Castle Donington
 came to the band. The show was filmed and later released on video while
 several other shows on the tour were being recorded for a possible live
 album. Finishing in Japan in November the band returned unaware of what
 was lurking around the corner.

 In March 1993 Bruce announced his departure feeling he had got to
 saturation point with other projects and the band set to work on
 finding a replacement while doing a final "Real Live Tour" tour with
 Bruce. The band visited Moscow for the first time and received an
 amazing reception and went on to complete 44 shows across Europe.
 Bruces final show was to be a live pay-per-view televised spectacular
 "Raising Hell" featuring the magician Simon Drake performing grisly
 tricks interspersed with live performance by the band. This included
 Simon playing a guitar solo with guitarist Dave Murray severed hands
 and Bruce being decapitated!

 After an intensive search Blaze Bayley of Wolfsbane was announced as
 Maidens new vocalist. The band and Blaze had already crossed paths as
 Wolfsbane had supported Maiden on 1990 UK Tour. This new partnership
 started work on the darkly smouldering "X Factor" album, again recorded
 at Steve's Barnyard Studios but with Steve himself co-producing it with
 Nigel Green. The X Factour started prior to the album launch in October
 1995 with shows in new territories Israel and South Africa. The album
 itself went to No.8 in the album chart while the band continued to tour
 comprehensively in Europe and the UK, highlighted with the bands Brixton
 Academy show before they continued throughout Western Europe, America,
 Japan and headlining many major festivals including the "Monsters of Rock"
 in Sao Paulo to 50,000 fans.

 1997 saw work start on Virtual XI, aptly named, this being their Eleventh
 Studio album. The cover artwork supplied by Melvin Grant depicted a boy
 watching a football match through a Virtual Reality headset while being
 surrounded by Armageddon and Eddie. This being a comment on technology
 taking over everything and the concern society shares as we approach the
 Millennium. This sentiment was also reflected in the material on the album
 with tracks such as "Futureal" and "When Two Worlds Collide". The football
 theme was carried through as Maiden, always being massive football
 supporters, decided to promote the album launch with their own Football
 tour, 1998 being World Cup year. The band set to work on putting together
 a dream team of world professionals such as Paul Gascoigne, Ian Wright,
 Faustino Asprilla, Marc Overmars, Patrik Viera and Stuart Pearce, Stuart
 being an immense Maiden fan. A Virtual XI team which featured ex-England
 stalwarts Terry Butcher, Tony Woodcock, Neil Webb and Paul Mariner toured
 throughout Europe playing games against teams with similarly famous names
 like Anders Limpar in Sweden, Gentile and Altobelli in Italy and even
 meeting up with the great Eusebio in Portugal.

 The first single "The Angel and The Gambler" featured an amazing video,
 seeing the band placed in a completely computer generated environment
 depicting Eddie in his new guise along with characters that appear in
 "Ed Hunter", the forthcoming computer game. Their successful nine month
 "Virtual World Tour" saw them in Europe, Japan, North America and finally
 South America.

 And so to now ..... January 1999.

 With the departure of Blaze Bayley, the return of both Bruce Dickinson
 and Adrian Smith brings a new twist to the Maiden tale. Now a six piece
 with a formidable three guitar onslaught, plans are currently taking
 shape for a Spring release of "Ed Hunter", touring in July/August/Sept.,
 recording a studio album at the end of the year and a full World Tour
 in 2000.

 Metal is currently enjoying a World wide resurgence in popularity and
 Maiden will once again be in the vanguard. And that's where they intend
 to stay for many more years to come.

@node "ADRIAN"

@{b} ADRIAN SMITH@{ub}

 For most long-standing Iron Maiden fans, the band as we remember them
 best really began to take shape with the arrival, in 1981, of guitarist
 Adrian Smith.

 Joining the band in time to record their second album, 'Killers', Adrian
 would prove to be not only a more than capable replacement for the exiting
 Dennis Stratton, but also, in fellow guitarist Dave Murray's words, "the
 best partner I'd ever had in Maiden, up to that point." - But then, not
 only was Adrian an excellent guitarist, he and Dave had known each other
 since they were at school together. Which perhaps explains why, as Adrian
 says, "there's almost a telepathy that exists between me and Dave, it's so
 spot on, it's uncanny. We just always know what the other one is about to
 do when we're playing." 

 In short, Adrian and Dave would become the perfect foil with which to
 make the trademark twin-lead guitar sound of Maiden back then work to
 its utmost potential. Then, as the years passed and each new Maiden
 album somehow managed to surpass the last, Adrian began revealing his
 talents as a songwriter, too, co-authoring, most often with singer
 Bruce Dickinson, but also with bassist Steve Harris and Dave, too,
 and eventually on his own, some of the best-remembered Maiden hits
 from the '80s. '2 Minutes To Midnight', 'Wasted Years', 'Stranger In
 A Strange Land', 'Can I Play With Madness', 'The Evil That Men Do'...
 the list of songs that began life as what Adrian calls "these little
 bits and pieces I come up with" is long and impressive. - As Steve
 says: "There's no doubting Adrian's talent, he even sings pretty well!
 And to have someone like him in the band really helped us come up with
 some interesting new ideas. He's so versatile, we were able to do things
 with Adrian we'd never been able to do before.

 Or as Adrian himself says: "The great thing about writing for Maiden is
 that the band has such a strong musical identity, you're always starting
 from a really good place. Like, if you fancy writing a fast one - well,
 there's no better band in the world for playing fast numbers!

 "Same with the slower, or more progressive type of things - again,
 there's no better band to take you into some strange musical places
 than Maiden. It's such an inspirational band to write for because it
 can do anything. And Steve would always encourage you to use your
 imagination and come up with something different from the usual 4/4
 beat thing most rock bands do all the time." 

 And yet, strange to relate, it so nearly didn't happen. Adrian had
 actually been offered the job in Maiden prior to the band going in
 to record their first eponymously-titled album, in January 1980,
 but had politely declined. A decision he quickly came to regret as
 the first Maiden album rocketed into the UK charts at No.4 just a
 few months later. 

 But then, as Adrian says: "I've never done anything just for the money.
 So I didn't regret it, really. I had my own band, Urchin, that I was
 still trying to get off the ground, and I think Steve respected that."

 "I suppose it was a bit like me with Maiden," says Steve, "Adrian had
 had Urchin going since he was at school and he rightly wanted to stick
 with it. I thought, fair enough, good luck to ya, mate! Then when we
 came back to him a year later, he was tempted I think 'cos he liked
 the band, he was a big mate of Davey's and Urchin was over by then
 anyway. And when he finally made up his mind to go for it with Maiden,
 he slotted in really quick." 

 Adrian was born in Hackney, east London, on February 27, 1957. The son
 of a painter and decorator, and the youngest child of three, he had
 what he describes now as "a typically happy, pretty boring upbringing,
 I suppose."

 A Manchester United football fan who later replaced the pictures on his
 bedroom wall of Georgie Best and Bobby Charlton with posters of Jimi
 Hendrix and Ritchie Blackmore, Adrian was 15 when he bought his first
 album: Deep Purple's 'Machine Head'. There was no looking back after
 that.

 "My sister used to go out with this guy and she used to borrow his
 records and leave them lying round the house. Stuff like Purple, Free,
 Black Sabbath... Then she stopped going out with him, so I started
 buying the records myself." 

 Dave Murray was the only other person he knew, he says, "that was into
 the same sort of thing as me." It was Dave who first encouraged Adrian
 to take up the guitar. "I noticed that whenever Dave brought his guitar
 to school he used to be surrounded by girls!" he chuckles. Soon the two
 were playing regularly together and had decided to form a band.
 So convinced was he of his destiny that Adrian left school at 16
 without even bothering to take his O-level exams. 

 "I thought, I'm going to be a rock star - I don't need all this!" he
 guffaws, before adding with a sad shake of his head: "It all seems so
 simple when you're still at school." - He was in for a rude awakening
 and while he was "waiting for something to happen" the would-be rock
 star worked a series of dead-end jobs: trainee spot-welder, apprentice
 cabinet maker, milkman..."I used to just lurk about until they got rid
 of me or I'd had enough and left - usually when there was a gig coming
 up." 

 The band he and Dave formed - Evil Ways - had now metamorphosed into
 Urchin. "Dave used to come and go," Adrian recalls. "Playing with me
 and then Maiden and then me again, then back to Maiden..."

 Looking back, he says "it was probably only a matter of time before
 I hooked up with Dave again." Fortunately for Adrian - and for his many
 fans - the band he did finally hook up with Dave again in was Iron Maiden.

 The rest, as they say, is history. The six studio albums Adrian recorded
 with Maiden in the '80s are still regarded as one of the most fertile
 - not to mention, successful - periods in the band's career.

 When he left the band, in 1990, to pursue a solo career, despite some
 excellent recordings, he admits now that, "it felt strange not being
 in the band any more. It had become a way of life for me and I realised
 how much Maiden will always be a part of me, and how much I missed it."

 The feeling, one suspected and knows now, was entirely mutual...

@node "BRUCE"

@{b} BRUCE DICKINSON@{ub}

 To some, he is the Errol Flynn of rock - the swashbuckling, chandelier-
 swinging, irrepressible hero who swoops across the stage, slays the
 dragon, rescues the girl and delivers the killer lines. To others,
 he is simply one of the greatest white male singers to strut his stuff
 with a British rock band since the Seventies heyday of British vocal
 legends like Robert Plant, Paul Rodgers, Roger Daltrey, and, of course,
 his own personal favourite, Ian Gillan.

 Who else could I being talking about than Bruce Dickinson? The singer
 whose name and face, whose voice and songs, have all been synonymous
 with great Maiden music since his titanic debut album with the band,
 'Number Of The Beast', back in 1982.

 'The Air Raid Siren', Maiden fans dubbed him early on, and it was an
 apt description. With his soaring, almost operatic vocals and romping,
 over-the-top stage personality, musically, Bruce and Maiden have always
 seemed made for each other.

 As Bruce now recalls: "The first time I saw Maiden play, I knew they
 were the band for me. They were playing second fiddle at a club show
 in London, back in 1979, which my previous band Samson, were actually
 headlining. But they had so many fans and they were just so tight and
 together, they blew us all away really.

 "I'd always been a massive Deep Purple fan," he continues, "and that's
 what Maiden seemed to me to be back then - a modern Deep Purple.
 And I just knew I had to sing with them!"

 And so it came to be. Maiden had already released two Top 10 albums
 in the UK - 'Iron Maiden' in 1980, and 'Killers' the following year
 - when Bruce replaced original singer Paul Di'Anno in the line-up,
 and many long-time Maiden observers wondered, at the time, if the
 band had done the right thing in allowing the more theatrical former
 Samson singer to take over from the streetwise Di'Anno.

 They needn't have worried. Far from signifying a decline in their
 fortunes, Bruce's appointment to the band was the beginning of the
 most successful and era in Maiden's career to date. Kicking off with
 their biggest-selling single up 'til then, 'Run To The Hills' (one of
 the very first songs Bruce wrote with the band), and culminating over
 a decade later with 'Fear Of The Dark', his last studio album with the
 band (and Maiden's last to go to No.1 in the UK, in 1993), Bruce is
 now rightly regarded as the definitive Iron Maiden vocalist.

 Also known these days for his parallel talents as a novelist, RockRadio
 Network DJ, aeroplane pilot, video director, radio and MTV presenter,
 and occasional solo artist, Paul Bruce Dickinson was born on August
 7, 1958, in the small mining town of Worksop, Nottinghamshire. Why he
 chose to be called by his second name - Bruce - rather than his real
 first name - Paul - he says he can no longer remember, except that he
 insisted everybody call him 'Bruce' from "as early as I can remember.
 Only my parents were allowed to call me Paul. Maybe I thought it sounded
 a bit unusual or something," he grins.

 Mum, who worked in a shoe shop, and dad, who was a mechanic in the army,
 were still in their teens when baby Bruce was born, and to begin with
 he was brought up by his maternal grandparents.

 "I was very much an accident," he reflects. "I think that's partly why
 I grew up feeling like such an outsider. I didn't have an unhappy
 childhood, but it was unconventional, to say the least."

 Sent away to boarding school from an early age, the young Bruce grew
 up "very independent and self-sufficient." Qualities which would hold
 him in good stead later when it came to dealing with the perils of a
 20-year career in the notoriously fickle music business.

 The first record he managed to persuade his folks to buy him was the
 single, 'She Loves You', by The Beatles.

 "I was still only four or five but I really loved that whole Mersey
 scene. I loved The Beatles and Gerry & The Pacemakers, and used to try
 and collect all their singles. Then I noticed they had B-sides, and
 that sometimes I liked them even more than the A-sides. And that was
 when I first began noticing the difference between 'good' music and
 'bad'. I didn't know it at the time, but that was the first time I
 began to think like a musician."

 It was at boarding school as a teenager that he first began to get
 seriously into albums. "I was 13 when I first heard Deep Purple's
 'In Rock' album, and it just blew me away!" Soon his burgeoning record
 collection boasted albums by artists like Van Der Graaf Generator,
 Arthur Brown, Jethro Tull, and Emerson Lake & Palmer.

 "I had everything. My favourite was always Deep Purple, though.
 I just thought 'In Rock' was the greatest thing ever! And after
 that, everything else went out the window and I started getting
 into bands and buying the music papers. And then, of course,
 thinking about starting my own band..."

 Starting off as a would-be drummer - "I'd 'borrowed' these bongos from
 the music room!" - it wasn't long before Bruce became bold enough to
 push his way to the microphone.

 "I don't know why, I just sort of knew I could sing," he shrugs. School
 bands and a couple of short-lived college outfits like Styx, Speed,
 and Shots all gave Bruce the on stage experience he would need before
 taking his first crack at the big time with Samson.

 Formed around the songs of Sidcup-born guitarist Paul Samson, the band
 had already been singled out in the press, along with Maiden, Saxon,
 and Def Leppard, as one of the leading lights of the then burgeoning
 New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. 

 Writing most of the songs with Paul, Bruce - billed, bizarrely, as
 'Bruce Bruce' (from the old Monty Python sketch) - would make two
 albums with Samson: 'Head On', released in 1980, and 'Shock Tactics',
 in 1981.

 As Steve Harris says: "They were OK albums but what really interested
 me was the singing. Right from the very first time I heard Bruce singing
 on stage with Samson, I remember thinking, 'Blimey, that singer's fucking
 great!'"

 The rest of the world has been saying something similar ever since.
 Who else but Bruce would have been able to sing such tongue-twisting
 lyrics as those on Steve Harris-penned epics like 'Rime Of The Ancient
 Mariner', 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son', and 'Mother Russia'? And who
 else but Bruce would be able to spit out the venom as convincingly on
 trigger-happy face-offs like 'Be Quick Or Be Dead', 'Aces High', and
 'Holy Smoke?

 As Bruce says enigmatically:
 "I don't believe in endings. I only believe in new beginnings." 

 You have been warned...

@node "DAVE"

@{b} DAVE MURRAY@{ub}

 You'd never know it from the way he throws himself around on stage,
 or from the way he makes his Gibson SG scream and bend to his will,
 but Dave Murray is actually the quietest, most unassuming rock star
 you could ever hope to meet. Indeed, the mile-wide smile apart, off
 stage, he is almost unrecognisable from the blonde-haired rock god
 we get to see on stage with Iron Maiden.

 "Oh, well, you can't walk down the street throwing shapes like you do
 on stage," he says with one those dazzling and frequent smiles. "I mean,
 you'd just look silly!"

 But it goes deeper than that. Along with the warmth and generosity and
 the general down-to-earth-ness, not to mention the musical talent, Dave
 Murray possesses a quality so rare in rock star circles as to be almost
 non-existent: humbleness.

 "It's my upbringing," he shrugs, not wanting to make a big thing of it.
 "When you start out with nothing, you don't expect much from life. For
 all this to happen to me - well, it's like a dream, really," he says,
 pausing to gaze, as if for the first time, at the gold records that
 adorn every wall in the office where we sit.

 David Michael Murray was born, of mixed Scots and Irish descent, in
 Edmunton, London, on December 23, 1956. Like Steve Harris, who had been
 born the same year just a few miles up the road, as a boy Dave was a
 fanatical football player and fan, as well as a keen cricketer. But his
 family was poor - his father was disabled and his mother worked part-
 time as a cleaner - and the family never settled anywhere long enough
 for Dave to establish himself in any of the schools' teams he could have
 played for. By his reckoning, he had been to a dozen different schools by
 the time he left for good at the age of 15.

 "It was tough but it was only looking back on it years later that I
 realised just how tough," he says now. "But then, maybe I wouldn't
 appreciate what I've got now so much, if it hadn't been for then."

 These days, when he's not touring and recording with Maiden, Dave lives
 on the exotic Hawaiian island of Maui with his Californian-born wife,
 Tamar, and their beautiful eight-year-old daughter, Tasha. But, he says,
 "Not a day goes by that I don't think, 'When is this going to end?'
 It's like it's all too good to be true."

 The first thing he did when he made some money was buy his folks a house.
 His father has since passed away but his mother still lives there to this
 day. The only surviving member of the band - along with Steve Harris
 - who first signed to EMI Records back in 1979, Dave's hard upbringing
 also helped him ride the highs and lows of his career in Maiden without
 ever losing his head. As he says, "I grew a protective shell around me
 and just got on with things. And I think that held me in good stead
 later with Maiden, especially in the early days."

 Dave first got interested in rock music when he was 15. He'd heard
 'Voodoo Chile (Part 2)' by Jimi Hendrix on the radio and "everything
 changed - just like that." He had been a skinhead up until then.
 "But I just ditched the Doc Martens and I got myself an old Afghan
 coat and became a hippy - man!" he chortles.

 He also got himself a guitar and started practising every night in his
 bedroom. "I didn't read music, I just used to sit and play along to
 records." His first band - a school trio called Stone Free - was actually
 with future fellow Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, who lived a few streets
 away. "Dave was a little bit further down the road than I was, in terms
 of playing," remembers Adrian. "I was a bit jealous, actually."

 From there, Dave had played with a number of different bands before
 meeting Steve Harris and joining Iron Maiden for the first time in 1976.
 As long-time Maiden scholars will know, he was actually sacked just a few
 months later - after a spat with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock - and that,
 for a while, Dave rejoined Adrian in Urchin, who recorded one single,
 'Black Leather Jacket', before Dave upped sticks again and returned to
 a now thankfully Wilcock-free Maiden.

 "I never wanted Davey to leave in the first place," says Steve today.
 "I always thought he was the best guitarist I'd ever worked with.
 He was one of those guys who really could play the guitar with his
 teeth, you know?"

 Musically, Dave's contributions to Maiden over the years have mainly
 been of the 'scintillating guitar solo' variety - witness any of his
 sublime work from early Blackmore-esque outbursts like the solo on
 'Phantom of The Opera' (from 1980's 'Iron Maiden') to more recent
 peaks of performance like the eye-watering solo on 'Lightning Strikes
 Twice' (from last year's 'Virtual XI').

 That said, despite a strike rate that works out to about one song per
 album - a trait he puts down to his own "laidback" nature more than
 anything - Davey is a talented songwriter, too. From the witty and
 wonderfully ludicrous 'Charlotte The Harlot' (from 'Iron Maiden'),
 to more thought-provoking stuff like the stiflingly atmospheric
 'The Prophecy' (from 1988's 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son'), more
 than any other member of Maiden, apart from Steve himself, Dave Murray
 is the living embodiment of the heart and soul of Iron Maiden.

 "I'm just lucky," he says typically modestly. "Lucky that I found such
 a great band to play in, and lucky to have such great fans that are into
 what we're doing."

 But then, that's Dave Murray - modest, humble, down-to-earth and about
 as great a rock guitarist as you're going to get.

 We're lucky to have him.

@node "JANICK"

@{b} JANICK GERS@{ub}

 He's that blur of hair and white Stratocaster that you first see
 buzzing round the top right hand corner of the stage. That madly
 whirling dervish who can't possibly be doing that and turning out
 those finely wrought guitar lines - can he?

 Yes, welcome to the totally wired world of Janick Gers - Iron Maiden's
 most over the top guitarist ever. Some accomplishment, given the
 contenders - not least Dave Murray himself, who became re-energised
 when Janick first joined the band as Adrian Smith's replacement,
 back in 1990.

 "Adrian and Janick are two completely different kinds of players,"
 explains Dave, who's been there since day one. "Adrian would have
 everything worked out before he went on, while Janick never prepares
 anything, he just goes with the flow. And he never stops moving.
 That's something else that was different to Adrian, who used to stand
 fairly still by comparison. But then, almost everybody looks like
 they're standing still next to Janick!"

 Janick Robert Gers was born in Hartlepool on January 27, 1957. His father
 had been in the Polish Navy, but settled in England after meeting his
 mother. (He later joined the British Royal Navy.) Swimming, football
 and music - "in that order" - were Janick's chief interests as a kid.
 It wasn't until he was in his teens that he began to take a serious
 interest in the guitar.

 "I started out wanting be John Lennon, then, once I got into the guitar
 properly, I decided Id rather be Ritchie Blackmore," he smiles. He was
 18 when he bought his first white Gibson Fender Stratocaster, a guitar
 he still uses now. "I got it second-hand from a guy in Darlington for
 two hundred quid and I remember thinking, 'Wow, this is fucking it!'"

 It was 1970 and his favourite bands were Deep Purple, Rory Gallagher,
 and T-Rex. Later he "became transfixed" by Led Zeppelin, but it was
 always Ritchie Blackmore's playing that "really did it for me. I thought,
 if I could be just a tenth as good as that, I could die happy."

 His first serious band was a local Hartlepool outfit called White Spirit,
 who he joined in 1975. Steeped in the music of Purple, Zeppelin and Rush,
 a single, 'Back To The Grind', was released on the independent label,
 Neat Records, in 1978.

 "It was a big deal for us up in the North East, but it meant nothing
 anywhere else. I was just happy to have a record out with my playing
 on it. But we were all still on the dole."

 Later signed to a major deal by MCA, their debut album, 'White Spirit',
 was released, ironically, the same year, 1980, that Maiden released
 their self-titled debut. But while Maiden - at the forefront of the
 then burgeoning New Wave of British Heavy Metal scene - watched their
 album soar into the UK charts at No.4, White Spirit was not nearly so
 well known, and their album fared considerably less well.

 "That whole NWOBHM thing passed us by, really" Janick admits. "We all
 used to moan that we didn't get enough attention from the media. But
 the truth is, Maiden simply made the better record. I can see that now."
 But it wasn't all gloom. When White Spirit supported Gillan on tour that
 year, Janick got to meet one of his life-long heroes, former Purple
 singer, Ian Gillan.

 "It was like getting to meet Father Christmas when you're a kid!" he
 laughs. When, just a few months later, he was invited to actually join
 Gillan, he was, he says, "absolutely gobsmacked!" A short-lived but
 highly productive period, in which Janick played on two of Gillan's
 finest albums, the live 'Double Trouble', a Top 10 hit in the UK, in
 1981, and 'Magic', another Top 10 entry in 1982, when Gillan decided
 after that to break up the band, Janick was philosophical.

 "I was disappointed but I thought, well, this gives me the chance to
 do something different." Having played in bands all his adult life, he
 took the unusual step of enrolling in college, where he took a course
 in Humanities. "While I was waiting for something else to come along,
 I thought I might as well do something useful," he explains simply.
 There had been talk, in 1986, of joining forces with former Twisted
 Sister singer Dee Snider, then some discussion about forming a band
 with ex-Maiden members, vocalist Paul Di'Anno and drummer Clive Burr,
 in the ludicrously named Gog Magog, which was also to have included
 ex-Def Leppard guitarist Pete Willis and former Whitesnake bassist
 Neil Murray. But nothing came of it and it was a guest appearance
 with Marillion at Wembley Arena, for the Prince's Trust, in 1988,
 that proved to be the catalyst that would finally seal his fate.

 Also on the bill that night was vocalist Bruce Dickinson, then still
 in Maiden. And when Bruce began work on his first solo album, 'Tattooed
 Millionaire', in 1990, it was to Janick he turned for help after being
 blown away by Marillion singer Fish's first solo album, 'Vigil In The
 Wilderness Of Mirrors', on which Janick co-wrote 'View From The Hill',
 one of the album's most affecting tracks.

 "I'd known Bruce since he was in Samson," Janick recalls. "He wanted
 to do something outside Maiden and I fitted the bill. Then when he
 called me up one day and asked if I'd rehearse some Maiden numbers,
 I was surprised. I said, 'What for?' He said, 'Adrian's left the band
 and we need somebody to fill in. Are you interested?' I was so
 flabbergasted, I didn't know what to say!"

 Although Janick joined too late to take part in much of the writing
 for the 'No Prayer For The Dying' album, he did have one song on
 there that would become one of their most notorious songs ever,
 the delightfully disrespectful, 'Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter'.

 "Bruce had this song that sounded a bit AC/DC-ish," Janick recalls.
 "And I said, 'Nah, it wants to be more like this...' So I put the chords
 in and then we re-did the chorus. It was great, so simple. And that was
 'Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter'."

 Originally conceived for the soundtrack of the movie, Nightmare On Elm
 Street - Part Five, the first time Steve Harris heard it, he says,
 "I said to Bruce, 'Look, this is too good to be lost on some movie
 soundtrack, let's do it in Maiden!" Which they duly did. Released as
 the second single from the 'No Prayer...' album, in January 1991,
 'Bring Your Daughter...' rocketed straight to the top of the UK charts,
 where it stayed for three gloriously non-PC weeks, becoming Maiden first
 ever UK No.1 single.

 Quite a start to his career. And he's been going from strength
 to strength ever since, as anyone will know who has witnessed more
 recent Janick-derived works like 'Lord Of The Flies' and 'The
 Unbeliever' - which he co-wrote with Steve on 1994's 'The X Factor'
 - or the beautifully poignant 'Como Estais Amigos' (rough translation:
 'How Are You My Friends') - which he co-wrote with vocalist Blaze on
 last year's 'Virtual XI'.

 The secret, he says, is not to have any secrets. "Just be yourself,
 that's my only advice."

 It's certainly worked for Janick.

@node "NICKO"

@{b} NICKO McBRAIN@{ub}

 More famous than any drummer has a right to be, with a style as punchy
 and distinctive as his battered, lived-in face, Nicko McBrain enjoys
 the rare distinction of being both the jester in the Iron Maiden pack
 and the ace.

 "I can't think of any other drummer that would have fitted in so
 perfectly," says Steve Harris. "Nick plays the drums the way most
 guitarists play their guitars - he's riffing right along with you,
 note for note, I've never known anything like it! He doesn't just
 hold the beat, he drives the whole thing along, and as the bass player
 having to keep up with him every night, that's great for me. It means
 none of us is ever allowed to give less than 100 per cent."

 Ask the great man himself, of course, and you get a more modest
 assessment. "Every drummer worth his salt has his own unique way
 of doing things," he says. "I just do what I do and, luckily for me,
 what I do sounds great in Iron Maiden."

 It certainly does. Joining the band in 1983, in time to record the
 'Piece Of Mind' album - still regarded by many, not least Steve Harris,
 as one of the greatest Maiden albums ever - it's impossible to imagine
 now what Maiden masterpieces like 'Where Eagles Dare', '2 Minutes To
 Midnight', 'Can I Play With Madness', 'Be Quick Or Be Dead' or
 ' Man On The Edge' would or could have sounded like without Nicko's
 full-spectrum drums thundering along behind them.

 Playing live on stage though, is where Nicko has really made his
 larger-than-life presence felt. Clive Burr, his predecessor, was a
 fine drummer, too, and an argument could be - and often is - had over
 which of the two is, technically, the best. For most of us, Nicko wins
 hands down. But there's never been any doubt over who was the more
 entertaining stage personality. The Mad McBrain, as he has become known
 to the Maiden fans, is almost as freaky an on-stage presence as Eddie,
 leaping shirtless from his drum stool to lead the cheers as the band
 bound into another diamond from their bejewelled back-catalogue.

 As for his off stage personality, "Mr Excess All-Areas," he once
 described himself as to me, and it's fair to say he wasn't exaggerating.
 I remember flying with him once from London, on our way to a record
 company party in Germany for what was then the new 'Seventh Son of A
 Seventh Son' album. We sat in First Class and Nick had already charmed
 the stewardesses into letting us have a jug of Bucks Fizz before the
 plane had even taken off. He then proceeded to hand out signed black-
 and-white photographs of himself on stage with Maiden. I'm not sure
 how many of the other Fist Class passengers - tired-looking businessmen,
 mostly - had heard of Iron Maiden before the plane took off, but they
 certainly had by the time we'd landed.

 "I'm a born entertainer, me," Nicko laughed, and we all laughed with
 him because we knew it was true (and besides, we were onto our third
 jug of Fizz by then).

 And yet, behind the laugh-a-minute facade, there is, after all, a real
 human being lurking. Michael Henry McBrain was born in Hackney, East
 London, on June 5, 1952. Don't laugh but he was, he cheerfully confesses,
 nicknamed 'Nicky' as a child, because that was the name of his favourite
 teddy bear - Nicholas The Bear. "I used to take him everywhere with me,
 and so my family just started calling me 'Nicky' for fun. Unless I was
 in trouble, then it was 'Michael!'"

 His first experience of music came via his father's love of trad- jazz.
 Little Nicky's hero was Joe Morella, the late, great drummer with the
 legendary Dave Brubeck jazz band.

 "I used to pretend I was Joe Morella hitting the tubs. I'd go into the
 kitchen and pick up a pair of knives and start hitting the gas cooker."

 Fed up with him bashing up the kitchen utensils, his parents finally
 bought him a proper drum-kit when he was 12.

 "Most kids wanted a bicycle or something like that, but all I wanted
 was drums. When my mum and dad finally got me one it was like all my
 birthdays and Christmases rolled into one!"

 He says he seemed to be able to play "almost straight away - I don't
 know how, I just could." By the time he left school at 15, he was already
 a veteran of several part-time pub groups. Musically, however, his tastes
 had broadened to include more contemporary Sixties sounds and suddenly
 his dad's jazz collection was infiltrated by records from The Shadows,
 The Animals, The Beatles and the Stones. On the recommendation of another
 drummer he knew, he began to take on session work, playing on countless
 different recordings.

 "I'd do anything - pop albums, folk albums, religious albums, or more
 rock type stuff, I didn't mind. It was all good practise."

 His first 'proper' band was The 18th Fairfield Walk, who did covers
 of Otis Redding and Beatles tunes. Then he joined the Wells Street
 Blues Band, who were, in the lingo of the day, "a more purist blues
 thing". But again, they never got beyond the clubs and Nicko found
 himself meandering from gig to gig, playing with now barely remembered
 names like singer and keyboardist Billy Day (who first started calling
 him Nicko, as a joke), The Blossom Toes (also featuring guitarist,
 Jim Cregan, later of Cockney Rebel and Rod Stewart fame) and others.

 It wasn't until 1975, when he joined Streetwalkers, the band formed
 by ex-Family members, vocalist Roger Chapman and guitarist Charlie
 Whitney, that Nicko first found any sort of fame.

 "They were lovely fellas, Roger and Charlie, and the Streetwalkers was
 a great little band. Why they never made it, I don't know."

 Unfortunately, the Streetwalkers was destined to be one of the great
 also-rans of the Seventies: good albums, no hits. From then until he
 joined Maiden, Nicko had been occupied mainly in session work, most
 memorably with the Pat Travers Band (on their 1976 'Makin' Magic' album),
 then with French soci-politico punk-metallists, Trust - who actually
 supported Maiden on tour in the UK in 1981.

 Steve, however, remembered him from before that, when Nicko was playing
 in a three-piece called McKitty, who Maiden shared the bill with at an
 open-air festival in Belgium, two years earlier.

 "I remember McKitty's guitar got fucked-up halfway through the set and
 Nick ended up doing this sort of solo jam thing while they tried to fix
 it. And he was just fucking amazing! I mean, I find drum solos pretty
 boring, but this was better than watching the rest of the set! Then
 when Clive left, Nick was one of the first people I thought of."

 Of course, nobody - not even Nicko - is perfect, and he admits he has
 his "funny moods", as he calls them. "One minute I'm up and I'm Mr Party
 All Night! Then the next minute I'm down and I'm Mr Grumpy. But that's
 just the way it is. Maybe I need to do that sometimes to get myself
 psyched up for a gig. 'Cos believe me, the way I play - the way this
 whole band plays - you better be psyched up for it! Or you'll get left
 behind!"

 And that's a promise...

@node "STEVE"

@{b} STEVE HARRIS@{ub}

 There is probably very little you can say about Steve Harris that the
 long-standing Maiden fan wont have heard already. The founding member
 of the band who first thought of the name 'Iron Maiden' back in the
 Seventies when he used to rehearse in his grandmother's front room;
 the leader of the gang who has led his troops through the ups and
 downs of a tumultuous 20-year recording career; the bass player with
 the sound so distinctive it could be the rattle of machine-gun fire
 as it thunders out of the speakers on album after album of superb
 take-no-prisoners rock music; the football fanatic who could have
 played for his beloved West Ham United (where he was on the books,
 briefly, as a teenager) before abandoning a budding career as a soccer
 star for a lifetime of over-the-top metal mayhem; and the talented
 songwriter who, alone, is responsible for some of the greatest musical
 moments in a career over- burdened with such jewels - from early
 mould-breaking masterworks like 'Rime Of the Ancient Mariner' to
 latter day creations like the towering 'Fortunes Of War' or, most
 recently, the anthemic 'Clansman', from last year's superb 'Virtual XI'
 collection... what is there, at this stage of the game, that I can tell
 you that most of you don't already know about this hugely charismatic
 figure?

 Well, let's start with the music. While it is true that Steve has
 always held the whip-hand when it comes to choosing the songs for an
 Iron Maiden album, not so widely recognised is his willingness to
 encourage the rest of the band to also contribute as much as they can
 to the overall scheme of things. Hence, early chip-off-the-old-block
 flashes of brilliance like guitarist Dave Murray's 'Charlotte The Harlot'
 and original vocalist Paul Di'Anno's 'Running Free', or mid- period
 masterpieces like vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith's
 '2 Minutes To Midnight' and 'Can I Play With Madness?', right up to
 modern-day classics like Dave Murray and Blaze Bailey's 'When Two Worlds
 Collide' from 'Virtual XI' - all of which began life as ideas other
 members of the band had had and that Steve helped, either directly or
 indirectly, turn into Maiden-shaped sensations.

 "It's weird how it works," says Steve. "People always assume I tell
 everyone what to do. In fact, it's not like that at all. Yes, I usually
 come in with a few songs I've written on my own - because that's the way
 I've always worked. But I always try and encourage everybody else to come
 up with stuff, too. It would be too samey if everything was written by
 one man all the time. And having people there in the past like Paul and
 Bruce and Adrian, it all helped take the band in slightly different
 directions and we did some really good stuff together.

 "It's the same now - people like Bruce, Janick, Adrian and Dave are
 never short of ideas, that's for sure!"

 As for the man himself, the story is no less contradictory. Still growing
 his hair right down his back, behind the heavily tattooed arms and the
 "no bullshit" attitude, lies a far more mature and surprisingly sensitive
 soul than the old cuttings might suggest; a music fan, first and foremost,
 who genuinely cares more about the integrity of Iron Maiden and its
 relationship with its fans, than with simple commercial gain.

 As he says, "I've never written a song in my life for the suits in the
 boardroom - unlike some bands we could all mention. Maiden's never been
 about that. And that's why, I think, the fans have stayed with us over
 the years. They know we really mean it when we say we're an album band,
 a live band. Hit singles don't matter to us. Never did. It's always been
 the music that comes first.

 "When we go in to start writing for a new album, we're doing it to please
 ourselves, as musicians. If we like it, that's good enough. Then come the
 fans. We want to like what we do but we also want to do something the
 Maiden fans will get off on, too. If we can do both, that's the ultimate.
 As for the critics and the record companies and all that - well, frankly,
 they don't come into the equation at all! Not while we're actually
 writing the music. No way! You'd never do anything good again if you
 worried what that lot thought about it."

 Indeed. But coming from a tough East London background meant that Steve
 was never going to be easily pleased or easily fooled. Taking 'no' for
 an answer was never an option.

 "Where I come from it was dog eat dog," he says. "I was brought up to
 believe you had to fight for what you wanted out of life."

 And that's exactly what Steve and Maiden did; fighting their way up
 first through the pubs and clubs more obsessed in the Seventies with
 punk, to find themselves, by the mid-Eighties, right at the top of the
 rock pile, the biggest, boldest, most uncompromising rock band in the
 world. A lofty perch Steve has looked out on the world at ever since.

 "Somebody has to be the leader," he says, "someone has to make the
 decisions. And as I formed the band, those decisions have always fallen
 to me. But I wouldn't want people to forget that this isn't some one-man
 show. This is a band as alive today as it ever was. More so, in lots of
 ways, in my opinion, than ever before, in fact! Everybody has their part
 to play and nobody could do it without the others to support them.
 The band is bigger than any one individual, and the fans know that.
 Which is why we've survived."

 Every successful team needs its captain. Fortunately for Maiden, Steve
 Harris has always worn the captain's armband with honour. Long may he
 continue to do so...

@node "Band History"

@{b} THE IRON MAIDEN HISTORY@{ub}

 The story of Iron Maiden begins in 1971, when 15 year old Steve Harris,
 inspired by the likes of Wishbone Ash, Jethro Tull and early Genesis
 bought a copy Telecaster bass for the then princely sum of L40. Steve
 had previously harboured visions of one day playing soccer for his
 beloved West Ham and was actually signed to them on schoolboy forms.
 However, the talent pool in the Hammer's youth organisation in those
 days was overflowing and the number of players who actually made it
 into the professional game were very few. The continuous playing and
 training regime also meant that that young Harry couldn't join his mates
 in drinking, watching bands and pulling girls. After thinking long and
 hard, he abandoned hopes of a soccer career and built up a strong liking
 and knowledge of rock music. He taught himself how to play by playing
 along to his favourite records and jamming with friends. This led to the
 formation of a band called Influence who then changed their name to
 Gypsy's Kiss.

 The Gypsies made their debut at a talent contest in Poplar, lasting all
 of six gigs before calling it a day. Steve fired by a burning ambition
 hooked up with a band called Smiler. The other band members were several
 years older than him, Steve picked up some valuable experience but still
 felt stifled. Smiler were a "good time boogie " band and although they
 played an early version of "Innocent Exile", they turned down "Burning
 Ambition" and made it clear that they didn't expect their bass player to
 leap around the stage and write songs. Steve finally realised that the
 only way to do what he wanted was to put his own band together and at
 the end of 1975, Iron Maiden was born. Steve got the name from seeing
 an Iron Maiden in an old movie of "The Man In The Iron Mask". It was a
 metal coffin with spikes on the inside and the victims were placed inside
 it and skewered to death.

 In the spring of 1976, the band secured a residency at The Cart and Horses
 pub in Stratford in London's East End. The first couple of gigs went okay,
 but Steve still felt there was something missing. Vocalist Paul Day was
 replaced by ex-Smiler songsmith Dennis Wilcock and he recommended a
 talented young guitarist by the name of Dave Murray. This put the back up
 of the resident guitarists Terry Rance and Paul Sullivan who took it as an
 insult to their talent and departed. Bob Sawyer, who used the name
 Bob D'Angelo, was recruited as second guitarist and with Ron Rebel on
 drums the first proper Maiden line-up came into being. As well as the
 Cart the band began to get gigs all over East London, building up a
 strong local following. After six months, the line-up changed again.
 Bob left as instead of trying to complement Dave's guitar - Bob kept
 trying to compete with him - a strict no-contest. Then, after a row at
 The Bridgehouse, Den fired Dave who went off to join Urchin, his old mate
 Adrian Smith's band.

 With all the hassles, the band decided to temporarily abandon the twin
 guitars concept and Terry Wapram joined as sole guitarist and Tony Moore
 was recruited on keyboards. Ron Rebel had decided he couldn't handle the
 aggravation and also left to be replaced by Barry Purkis - who would
 later call himself Thunderstick. The new line-up played one gig at
 The Bridgehouse and it was painfully obvious that keyboards were not the
 answer. Exit Moore followed by Wapram who claimed he couldn't play without
 keyboards! Steve went down to an Urchin gig and persuaded Davey to rejoin
 the Maiden fold. Den. then quit just before a gig in South London and when
 Thunderstick also left, things looked bleak. Steve recruited ex-Smiler
 drummer Doug Sampson and while the three of them rehearsed they looked
 for a new singer. Eventually, a mate of Steve's recommended Paul Di'Anno.
 Paul passed his audition with flying colours and the band set about their
 comeback. Things were difficult at first as in 1977 the Punk / New Wave
 revolution was in full swing and most of the venues were only booking
 new wave acts. The record companies felt the same. The band did receive
 offers, if they were prepared to cut their hair and go punk. Needless to
 say you can guess Harry's answer.

 By late 1978, the situation had improved enough to allow the band to
 work to make their comeback and get regular gigs. They realised that they
 needed a demo and so on New Year's Eve they were in Spaceward Studios
 near Cambridge recording "Prowler", "Invasion", "Strange World" and
 "Iron Maiden". The L200 cost of the recording session was all that they
 had and so the band couldn't buy the master tape. When they went back a
 couple of weeks later to pay for the tape and mix, the tape had been
 wiped, leaving them with just the cassettes from the original session
 unedited and unmixed. Dave gave his copy to Neal Kay, a DJ with a
 passionate love of hard rock who held regular rock nights at
 The Soundhouse, which adjoined the Bandwagon pub in Kingsbury,
 North London. The band were now finding it easier to book gigs and
 gained a residency at The Ruskin Arms in Manor Park. Neal played the
 tape at one of his Soundhouse nights and was astonished at the reaction.
 It became the most requested item for months and Maiden began to play
 there. The demo tape had also come to the attention of Rod Smallwood.
 A rugby mate of Rod's, who also worked with Steve, passed the tape on,
 and after listening to it and checking the band out, offered his
 services as manager. Rod arranged gigs all over the country to allow
 the band to build-up a nation-wide following and arranged gigs in or
 near central London to get record companies to check out Maiden. One
 such gig was at The Marquee on October 13th. John Darnley came from
 EMI to see Maiden and Rod had a side bet with the Marquee manager that
 the gig would sell-out (700 fans) by 7pm. Rod won his bet and EMI signed
 Iron Maiden the following month. In the summer, Maiden had been featured
 in the music paper "Sounds". It was in this feature that Geoff Barton who
 would later go on to found "Kerrang!" coined the phrase "The New Wave
 Of British Heavy Metal". Maiden also made their debut at The Music
 Machine in Camden as special guests to Motorhead who were playing under
 the name of "Iron Fist And The Hordes From Hell". Before the year was
 out the band would play the Music Machine twice more - as headliners.

 In the meantime, the band, who had been deluged with requests for copies
 of the demo tape from fans decided to put it out on their own Rock Hard
 label. The 7" EP was christened "The Soundhouse Tapes" and to keep it
 special for the hard-core fans was only sold at gigs and by mail-order.
 The 6000 copies sold-out almost immediately making it an instant
 collectors item. Despite requests from major chainstores for the record
 the band decided to keep it as something special for their fans.
 In between gigs, the band went into EMI's Manchester Square studios to
 record "Sanctuary" and "Wrathchild" for a compilation LP called
 "Metal For Muthas". They also recorded four songs for Radio One's
 "The Friday Rock Show". Guitarist Tony Parsons came in as second
 guitarist to make it a five-piece again.

 Over the Christmas period, the band underwent more line-up changes.
 Doug Sampson had to quit for health reasons and Parsons, who always
 appeared bored on stage, got the elbow. Clive Burr and Dennis Stratton
 took over on drums and guitar. The band then got down to recording their
 first album with Will Malone in the producer's chair. In February 1980,
 while the band went out on the "Metal For Muthas" tour to promote the
 compilation, their first single "Running Free" was released. It totally
 exceeded record company expectations entering the UK charts at No.44 and
 earning the band an invitation to appear on BBC TV's "Top Of The Pops".
 The band accepted - but only if they could play live - the first band
 since The Who eight years earlier. Surprisingly the BBC agreed.
 On April 14th the band's debut album "Iron Maiden" was released rocketing
 straight into the charts at No.4! Maiden, who had followed "Metal For
 Mouths" with a guest slot on the Judas Priest "British Steel" UK Tour,
 began their own fully fledged headline UK Tour playing some 40-odd dates
 in just under two months. They also appeared again at the Marquee,
 including a run of four consecutive nights all totally sold-out.

 In August, the band were invited by U.S mega-stars Kiss to support them
 on their European Tour and to play at Reading on the Saturday night as
 special guests to UFO, giving Steve the opportunity to play on the same
 bill as UFO's Pete Way, one of his all-time heroes. With Kiss, the two
 bands got on famously and Maiden's following on the continent grew
 immensely. Maiden did not play on the UK dates having just finished
 their UK tour and so took a week off to holiday in the Italian sun.
 On returning from the KISS tour it was announced that due to "musical
 differences" Dennis was leaving the band. Dennis's taste in music was
 quite different from the rest of the band and his ideas were not in
 line with where the band wanted to go and so a parting of the ways was
 necessary. The split was acrimonious at first, but nowadays Dennis and
 the band are good friends and Dennis manages The Cart and Horses.
 The band did not have very far to look for a replacement and Adrian
 Smith joined the fold. The band had actually approached Adrian before
 Dennis, but as Urchin seemed to be happening H decided to stick it out.
 A mini-UK tour was hastily arranged to break Adrian in. Then they began
 work on a new album with Martin Birch producing. They broke off from
 recording to play a special Christmas gig at London's Rainbow Theatre,
 which was filmed for future video release. The capacity crowd were given
 an early Christmas present when the second half of the show had to be
 played all over again due to problems with the sound recording. Nobody
 left early!

 The "Killers" album came out in February '81 as the band embarked on
 their first World Tour. It charted in the UK at No.12 and earned the
 band gold discs from several major territories. As well as Europe,
 the "Killer" World Tour took in first-time visits to Canada, America
 and Japan. A live EP featuring performances recorded in Japan was
 released called "Maiden Japan". In March a 30 minute video of the
 Rainbow Christmas show came out. As the "Killer" tour came to an end,
 it was clear that Paul Di'Anno's days were numbered. He had believed
 in living the rock and roll lifestyle to the full, despite warnings
 from the rest of the band, Rod and doctors - damaging his vocal chords
 and his health. He had also begun to turn away from the out and out
 hard rock played by Maiden towards a bluesier, Whitesnake-like style.
 Once more a replacement was close at hand. Bruce Bruce of fellow UK
 rockers Samson was becoming disenchanted at that band's drift towards
 the kind of music that ironically Paul was embracing and so he
 auditioned for Maiden and was in, reverting to his normal name of
 Dickinson. A few hastily-arranged dates in Italy introduced Bruce to
 Maiden and he made a triumphant UK debut at The Rainbow, the band also
 took the opportunity to play some new songs currently being recorded
 for the new album. Bruce was christened "the air-raid siren" by the
 fans due to his powerful vocals. The year ended with Maiden returning
 to The Ruskin Arms under the thinly disguised alter-ego of Genghis Khan
 to a play a charity / Dave Murray birthday bash. 

 If 1981 could be viewed as a successful year for Maiden, then 1982
 exceeded all expectations. The band were already engaged in a sell-out
 British leg of "The Beast On The Road" tour when the first single from
 the new album - "Run To The Hills" reached No.7 in the UK Charts.
 The new album "The Number Of The Beast" blew away the competition to
 enter the UK chart at No.1 and going Top 10 across Europe. It also
 charted in the US and Canadian charts. "The Beast On The Road" tour
 lived up to it's name with the band playing 180 dates in eight months.
 Once again the band broke new ground visiting Australia and New Zealand
 for the first time and on June 29th, they played their first sold out
 headline gig in the US at New York's Palladium. In August, the band
 broke off from their US Tour and flew back to the UK to perform at
 The Reading Festival in front of 35,000 fans. At the end of the tour,
 another casualty in the Maiden line-up was Clive Burr. A series of
 personal problems and the gruelling Iron Maiden schedule took it's toll
 and so in January 1983, the band flew to Nassau to record the next album
 with one Nicko McBrain in the drummer's chair. The band had met Nicko
 during the UK leg of the "Killer" tour when he played with French
 rockers Trust who had supported Maiden. In America, the band were
 branded Satanists by a small band of ill-informed, self opinionated
 individuals who had totally missed the point. Their accusations -
 totally untrue-gaining the band more publicity. 

 Drummer, raconteur and all-round headcase, Nicko received his baptism of
 fire during the recording of "Piece Of Mind" in Nassau. The band took
 time out from recording to film a promo video for the forthcoming single
 "Flight Of Icarus", the script called for someone to wear blue make-up
 and dress in monk's robes. Nicko as the new boy volunteered for the
 role. In May, the new album came out and entered the UK Charts at No.3
 and the band began the "World Piece Tour" at Hull City Hall. The tour
 was once again a world-wide affair with the band achieving major status
 throughout the countries that they played. In the U.S, they were playing
 to larger and larger audiences and selling out almost everywhere.
 The tour came to an end in front of a Europe-wide TV audience in Dortmund.
 As a climax to the show, the band viciously attacked the walking Eddie.
 Apparently, they had been having thoughts about dispensing with the
 services of their monster mascot, but fortunately the reports of Eddie's
 demise were grossly exaggerated and he was back on record covers and
 stages the following year. The band went into the New Year, with a stable
 line-up, facing the prospect of their busiest year yet. 

 1984, opened with a confident (but not complacent) Iron Maiden having a
 three week break before starting work on the new album. It was rehearsed
 in Jersey and once again recorded in Nassau. By the time "Powerslave" hit
 the streets in September, the band were already three weeks into the
 gruelling "World Slavery Tour" pushing the boundaries ever onwards,
 the band opened the tour in Poland - the first time ever that a major
 rock act had played there with a full western stage production.
 The band also played in Hungary, and Yugoslavia and the groundbreaking
 "Iron Maiden Behind The Iron Curtain" tour was a huge success and earned
 the attention of the world's media. In those days with the Iron Curtain
 still firmly in place, a tour of those countries was a major undertaking.
 The whole tour was also filmed for a documentary which was released later
 in the year as "Behind The Iron Curtain". From Eastern Europe, the band
 returned via Italy to the UK, where the "Powerslave" album was released
 and went straight to No.2. The album featured the most elaborate artwork
 so far and the massive stageshow reflected this. Maiden played four
 nights at Hammersmith Odeon, including one night with spoof rockers
 Bad News for charity. Eddie was now a twenty feet tall monster appearing
 at the end of the song "Iron Maiden". The tour was an overwhelming
 success, the band were at the height of their powers, the stage show was
 awesome and the merchandise receipts broke records at many venues.
 The band interrupted the U.S. leg of the tour and made their first visit
 to South America when they played in front of an estimated 200,000
 people at the "Rock In Rio" festival. The highlight of the U.S. tour was
 at Long Beach Arena in Southern California when Iron Maiden became the
 first band to sell-out four consecutive nights - a total audience of
 52,000. The Long Beach shows were filmed with the view to releasing
 another live video, and live album capturing the band at their very
 best. The tour came to an exhausting conclusion in July 1985. With a
 double live album and live video due for release in the autumn,
 the band could at last take their first real holiday for five years
 and they needed it. The live album and video both called "Live After
 Death" came out in October, the album charted at No.2 and the video was
 in the best-selling music video charts for months. 

 The new album "Somewhere In Time" was recorded in Nassau and Munich and
 was released in September 1986. It charted in the UK at No.3 and went
 gold or platinum in every major territory. To promote the album, the
 band went "Somewhere On Tour". The new album showed a marked change in
 the band's style with the use of synthesisers as background on several
 songs. However, any fans who feared it could water down Maiden's style
 needed only to listen to the likes of "Heaven Can Wait" or "Alexander
 The Great". The tour once again began with a visit behind the Iron
 Curtain, commencing in Belgrade and finishing a mere eight months later
 in Osaka. The stage show was once again spectacular, Eddie had now been
 turned into a cyborg and the climax of the show saw the entire band
 being lifted into the air while a giant inflatable Eddie head and claws
 appeared. The band were also filmed and interviewed for a video
 documentary released in 1987 entitled "Twelve Wasted Years" - a video
 chronicle of their rise to the top featuring previously unseen archive
 footage and interviews with key people involved in the Iron Maiden
 success. With the tour successfully completed it was time to start
 thinking about the next album. 

 "Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son" was an epic masterpiece of an album - it
 marked the first and (so far) only time that Iron Maiden have recorded
 a "concept" album. This wasn't originally the idea, but as the band
 wrote and rehearsed, the songs seemed to be linked by a common theme.
 The cover artwork also showed a marked change, being more subdued in
 style that anything previously seen. The "Seventh Tour Of A Seventh Tour"
 also broke with Maiden tradition, beginning in the U.S and being made
 up of a combination of arenas and festivals. The high spot of the entire
 tour came in August when Maiden headlined at the legendary "Monsters Of
 Rock" festival at Donington. Supported by one of the strongest bills ever
 seen at the festival (Kiss, David Lee Roth, Megadeth, Guns and Roses &
 Helloween), the band played before an all-time record crowd for the
 event of 102,000. Maiden played a blistering set and the stage show was
 fantastic, climaxing with a massive fireworks display. The band then
 took the "Monsters" shows to Europe, before ending the tour on home
 territory with a series of arena shows - the first time that the band
 had played such large venues in the UK. The two nights at Birmingham
 NEC - arguably the best non-festival shows of the tour were filmed for
 a new live video which would be co-directed and edited by Steve Harris.
 The tour came to an end on 12th December back at Hammersmith Odeon - the
 scene of so many previous Maiden triumphs. With no album scheduled for
 1989, the band were able to look forward to a real break to recharge
 their batteries and spend some real time with their families. 

 Bruce and Adrian "rested" by recording solo albums, while Steve spent
 most of his time editing the Birmingham footage. The band did finally
 get together again in November 1989 for the release of the video "Maiden
 England". EMI and Sanctuary threw a lavish launch party with a strong
 British theme, the hall was decked out with Union Jacks and the invited
 representatives of the world's media dined on fish and chips and drank
 bitter, while the band spent their time being photographed and
 interviewed. "Maiden England" was once again a best seller amongst
 music videos. 

 In January 1990, the band assembled at Steve's to start work on
 "No Prayer For The Dying". Work had barely begun when, for the first
 time in seven years there was a personnel change. Adrian fresh from his
 solo album, revealed that he wasn't sure that he could still give
 Maiden 100 percent and so by mutual consent left the band. Fortunately,
 the solution was once again close at hand. Janick Gers who was well-known
 to the band having played with Gillan among others and who had recently
 worked with Bruce on his solo album and tour was auditioned and invited
 to join. The recording of the album continued on schedule. For the first
 time since "Beast" the band recorded the album on home soil, at Steve's
 own studio in a converted barn on the side of his house in Essex.
 The content of the album took on a more serious feel, as the band's
 lyrics began to deal with contemporary issues. The album cover and
 packaging artwork had a more sinister look about it, The album was
 released on October 1st 1990 and debuted at No.2 in the UK chart.
 After not treading the boards for almost two years, the band were
 raring to get out and play live again. The "No Prayer On The Road"
 tour got underway with a "secret" gig in Milton Keynes on 19th September
 1990. After the mammothh production of the previous tour, it was a
 back-to-basics approach this time around with a minimum of stage set
 and lighting. It ably demonstrated that Maiden could put on a great
 show in their own right without having to be surrounded by mega-watts
 of sound and light and a big-budget production. Janick also made a big
 difference live, his high-energy enthusiasm and on-stage antics rubbed
 off on everyone, especially Davey. The band and their fans enjoyed being
 close to each other again, feeding off each other's enthusiasm reminiscent
 of the earlier days. The tour ended in Salt Lake City in March 1991.
 It was originally scheduled to carry on to Japan and Australia, but the
 travel and hipping difficulties presented by the outbreak of the Gulf War
 brought about the premature end. 

 When it came time to think about the new album, the band and management
 decided that Eddie needed a change of image for the 1990's.
 From comic-book horror it was decided that Eddie should be more
 straightforward horror and to that end Derek Riggs and several other
 artists were invited to submit ideas of how they saw the "new" Eddie
 and a design submitted by Melvyn Grant was selected. The album
 "Fear Of The Dark" was released in May 1992 as the band opened the
 "Fear Of The Dark" tour in Scandinavia. The album gave the band their
 third UK No.1. Iron Maiden were once again asked to play at Donington
 in August. The band played an even stronger show than in 1988.
 They knew what to expect this time around and so were less effected by
 nerves. The entire show was filmed for a live video to be released the
 following year. Several shows were also taped for a future live album.
 The stage show was more elaborate although not to the excess of '88 and
 Eddie appeared as a giant tree creature as per the album cover. The tour
 ended on November 4th and as the band flew home from Japan, they were
 unaware of the bombshell that was about to be dropped in March 1993. 

 Bruce had been thinking for some time about leaving Iron Maiden. Always
 a workaholic, Bruce had several projects on the go outside of Maiden and
 with a young family, the demands on his time were reaching saturation
 point. Something had to give and Bruce felt he'd gone as far as he could
 with Iron Maiden. It had been decided that rather than release a double
 live album as they had with "Live After Death" the new live set would be
 released as two separate albums. The first would feature material from
 the band's post LAD period, while the second would feature more vintage
 material. The fans then had a choice of purchasing both albums or just
 material from either era. As the first live album - "A Real Live One"
 approached and the band prepared for the "Real Live Tour" they advertised
 for a replacement for Bruce - with the result that they were flooded with
 thousands of tapes CD's and videos from the hopeful to the hopeless.
 Meanwhile, the band visited Moscow. The reception the band received from
 the happy Russian headbangers was amazing. Once the tour was complete
 it was time to sit down and sift through the myriad of demos from
 prospective singers. Bruce was given a suitably grisly send-off at the
 end of "Raising Hell" a pay-per-view magic and music show featuring
 TV magician Simon Drake which was televised live around the world. 

 After an intensive search, it was announced at the end of the year that
 Bruce's successor was to be Blaze Bayley from Wolfsbane. Wolfsbane had
 supported Iron Maiden on their 1990 UK Tour and so the band had the
 opportunity to see Blaze in action and knew what he was capable of.
 Blaze was favourite from the start and after listening to all the tapes
 and holding auditions no one cropped up that the band felt would be more
 suitable. Once all the hoop-la of Blaze's joining had died down, the
 band set about a period of intensive rehearsals so that they and Blaze
 could get used to each other and then start work on the new album. 

 The band not only had a new singer, but also a new producer. For the
 first time since 1980, a Maiden studio album would not be produced or
 co-produced by Martin Birch. Since the mid 80's Martin had been in
 semi-retirement only returning to the mixing desk for Maiden. Now he
 had decided to completely retire. It was decided that Steve would share
 the producer's chair with Nigel Green. Nigel had originally been the
 tape operator on the "Killers" and "Beast" albums, having since gone on
 to become a top-flight producer in his own right. The new album took over
 a year to complete. The importance of the album meant that every step was
 taken to ensure that everything was just right. The new album was
 christened "The X Factor" as in X - the unknown. It finally hit the
 streets in October 1995 with the "X Factour" beginning shortly before. 

 The tour opened with dates in Israel and South Africa - the band's first
 time in either country and the experience and the welcome from the local
 fans made the band want to return there next time. They were also
 supposed to play in Beirut, but the Lebanese government withdrew their
 visas and even intervention through diplomatic channels failed to change
 their minds. The band took advantage of the unexpected lull to fly back
 to the UK to do MTV's "Most Wanted". They then flew to Romania behind
 the former Iron Curtain to undertake the first COMPREHENSIVE tour of
 Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Czech Rebublic,
 Romania). Any doubts as to Blaze's ability and fan reaction were laid
 to rest as the band received a warm welcome from all the fans,
 especially at home. The Brixton show was one of the best of all-time.
 The band were fired up and so was the crowd. In the lead-up to Christmas
 and early in the New Year Maiden played in Western Europe before moving
 on to America, Canada and Japan. In the summer the band played European
 festivals and toured South America including headlining the "Monsters
 Of Rock" in front of 50,000 in Sao Paulo stadium. 

 1997 saw work start on Virtual XI, aptly named, this being their
 Eleventh Studio album. The cover artwork supplied by Melvin Grant
 depicted a boy watching a football match through a Virtual Reality
 headset while being surrounded by Armageddon and Eddie. This being
 a comment on technology taking over everything and the concern society
 shares as we approach the Millennium. This sentiment was also reflected
 in the material on the album with tracks such as "Futureal" and
 "When Two Worlds Collide". The football theme was carried through as
 Maiden, always being massive football supporters, decided to promote
 the album launch with their own Football tour, 1998 being World Cup
 year. The band set to work on putting together a dream team of world
 professionals such as Paul Gascoigne, Ian Wright, Faustino Asprilla,
 Marc Overmars, Patrik Viera and Stuart Pearce, Stuart being an immense
 Maiden fan. A Virtual XI team which featured ex-England stalwarts
 Terry Butcher, Tony Woodcock, Neil Webb and Paul Mariner toured
 throughout Europe playing games against teams with similarly famous
 names like Anders Limpar in Sweden, Gentile and Altobelli in Italy
 and even meeting up with the great Eusebio in Portugal. 

 The first single "The Angel and The Gambler" featured an amazing video,
 seeing the band placed in a completely computer generated environment
 depicting Eddie in his new guise along with characters that appear in
 "Ed Hunter", the forthcoming computer game. Their successful nine month
 "Virtual World Tour" saw them in Europe, Japan, North America and
 finally South America. 

 And so to now ...... January 1999. 

 With the departure of Blaze Bayley, the return of both Bruce Dickinson
 and Adrian Smith brings a new twist to the Maiden tale. Now a six piece
 with a formidable three guitar onslaught, plans are currently taking
 shape for a Spring release of "Ed Hunter", touring in July/August/Sept.,
 recording a studio album at the end of the year and a full World Tour
 in 2000. 

 Metal is currently enjoying a World wide resurgence in popularity and
 Maiden will once again be in the vanguard. And that's where they intend
 to stay for many more years to come.

@{b} EXCLUSIVE Q&A WITH NEW MAIDEN LINE UP... 10/02/99@{ub}

 Anticipating another 8,000 messages on the Bulletin Board in response
 to this incredible news, the site Administrator managed to track down
 the lads and ask them a few pertinent questions. Find out just what
 they had to say below...


@{b} 1) How does it feel to be back together after so long?@{ub}

 Bruce Dickinson: It doesn't feel like so long, in fact, at all.
 When we got back in the room together, me and Steve gave each other
 a great big hug. He's only ever hugged me three times in my life!
 Fantastic and great fun. We're all looking forward to making great
 music and having a phenomenally good time. It was great. We're all
 making plans as to how we're going to enjoy ourselves while playing
 this great stuff.

 Steve Harris: I think it's going to be really exciting to have Bruce
 and Adrian back. I'm very excited that there's six people in the band.
 Three guitar players and all that - I'm looking forward to it a lot.
 As far as I know, there's no-one in metal or rock that's really done
 the three guitar thing apart from Skynyrd. I really like the Skynyrd
 stuff - not that it'll be like that, but it should be interesting.
 Adrian jammed with us at Donington and it felt great to have three
 guitar players.

 Dave Murray: I think the chemistry within the band has increased with
 getting Bruce and Adrian back. The magic that was there before, I think
 we can re-create again. There was something still there from X amount
 of years ago between us, and getting back together, there's a real
 excitement. It's a kind of excitement between everybody. You can really
 feel it, and I think it's going to be great. There's so much chemistry
 with this line up now.

 Janick Gers: It's incredible to be back together with Bruce. He's an
 incredible singer. We've kept in touch over the years anyhow, as I have
 done with Adrian, and it's going to be really interesting with three
 guitars. I don't know how they're going to fit us all on stage but it's
 going to be a very powerful sound and we're all really excited about it.

 Adrian Smith: That feels great. It's great to be playing back with the
 guys again. Everyone's relaxed and happy about it and we're looking
 forward to playing all the classic Maiden songs on this tour. It's kind
 of uncanny. I've seen everyone individually over the years, but it's the
 first time we've all been together in a working situation for a long
 time - it must be almost 8 years in times of the band. We built up our
 own language over a period of time. We fell back into that straight away.

 Nicko McBrain: Really good, in that it doesn't really feel as though
 we've been apart as long as it has been. I suppose when you get a bond
 like the one we had, it's very, very strong. It's quite a strong essence,
 the bonding side of things, to actually feel like that after 7 years for
 Adrian and 4/5 for Bruce. It was really good and very exciting.


@{b} 2) Three Guitars for the first time - how will that work and do you
    find it exciting?@{ub}

 Bruce Dickinson: I'm really excited. The characters of the three
 guitarists actually blend very well. Jan has this completely anarchic
 style, which in a sense can now be set free, as before he had to fulfil
 Adrian's parts and his parts. Davey has a very distinct style. They all
 have. They're all capable of being as disciplined as they need to be,
 but they've all got such separate personalities that it's going to be
 fantastic. I think with Adrian back in the band, he's going to make
 such a huge contribution. Having worked with him he's as good, if not
 better than he ever was. There's always work for three guitars in a
 Maiden song, simply because of the number of guitars that we laid down
 in the studio that we never ever do live. In actual fact the old Maiden
 songs will sound even better with three guitars. The new stuff may
 possibly take to a whole new level.

 Steve Harris: It's difficult to say if the three guitars will affect the
 writing, as in the past we've written stuff where there were two guitars
 and another behind it or three either unison or harmony guitars anyway.
 So I don't think it'll be a big problem and I don't think it'll take us
 in a different direction, or anything like that. Sometimes when we break
 away and do harmonies live, with the bass and drums, it opens it up and
 sounds really good like that, but sometimes on an album we put a rhythm
 guitar there, and live you can't do that. Now we can!

 Dave Murray: I suppose Skynyrd are one of the only bands around with
 that sort of line up. With Maiden, on the material side of it, it
 really weighs favour between guitars. In fact there's a lot of stuff
 on the studio albums with three guitar harmonies anyway, and that's
 most of the old material, so we'll be able to incorporate that in.
 And also, I think with the new stuff as well. People are going to be
 thinking that we'll be doing three part guitar, so I think it's going
 to actually broaden the whole thing. It's going to widen and give it
 another dimension. Sometimes they say less is more, but I think in this
 case, more is heavier! More is going to be bigger, so I'm really looking
 forward to it, and the thing is, with Adrian, it's going to widen the
 whole scope musically, where we can do more things within the band
 musically, so I think it's going to take shape very well.
 Subconsciously, I think we will write differently also; it'll be there
 in the back of your head, because you can actually add things in there.
 I think it's going to affect things - slightly - it'll make things a lot
 broader in some sense, but that we're yet to find out. I really think
 it's going to work great. It'll broaden the sound and make it damn fat!

 Janick Gers: Really interesting because the aesthetics of it. You can
 actually double up in various chords and stuff, so we can make it a kind
 of bigger sound in various parts. The galloping parts will be the same,
 but probably distinctly heavier, because of the extra part there. There
 may be various parts where we might leave the bass and the two guitars
 might go off and might have a rhythm under them. And obviously, where
 we can add three part harmonies, that would be real fun to do. There's
 quite a lot of different things we can actually put into the songs and
 bring them into the year two thousand. I suppose if you want to look at
 it like that, it could be very exciting.

 Adrian Smith: If ever there was a band where three guitars could
 compliment the music, it was Maiden. There are a lot of guitar
 harmonies and guitar parts. The songs are long and I think there's
 a lot of space there for three guitar players. It will compliment
 the music and it's never really been done before in the rock and
 metal field - obviously Skynyrd, but I don't think in the metal
 field it's been done, which gives it an exciting dimension. I think
 it will sound amazing as we all play slightly differently. In a
 concert situation it will be interesting as well, because it keeps
 changing the focal point which makes it interesting from an audience
 perspective. I also think, as we haven't worked together in this
 format yet, I imagine that as we write together, Janick, Dave and
 I will write together. There's a lot of interesting stuff we can
 work with - but I don't think it means we're going to have 98 guitar
 solos in each song, I think it'll be more of a textural thing.
 Who knows! It's difficult to say until we start working. At best,
 it will add another dimension to the band and will compliment what
 we already have.

 Nicko McBrain: Chaos! Absolute chaos! First of all I think it's going
 to bring an added strength that has previously been un-tapped. So we
 know that Adrian's guitar style worked for so many years with the band
 and then when Janick came in, his style of playing is quite fiery and
 very effervescent, compared to Adrian who's more laid back and a more
 controlled player. We've got the best of both worlds there, but I said
 to the guys that they need to take out added insurance for on stage as
 there's 5 of them running around! It's going to be like the Grand
 National meets RollerBall! I'm looking forward to it and it's going
 to be a challenge, an exciting one, with the three guys, especially
 on the older songs. There's going to be picking and choosing who does
 what solo, and maybe even adding new parts as you can't have one guy
 standing there while everyone else is playing! The people are going
 to be so excited seeing the three guys up there in the first place,
 but with the added dimension of the musical parts involved, I think
 it's going to very exciting.


@{b} 3) How do you think the fans will feel about the band reforming?@{ub}

 Bruce Dickinson: I think they'll be quite pleased. It means that
 I don't have to play possum when people ask me questions. It's going
 to be fantastic. I've become very conscious, in terms of Emails and
 personal encounters with fans who have never seen Maiden with me,
 and there's an enormous number of young fans who have never seen
 Maiden except on video - Live After Death etc. - and that's terrifically
 exciting as I think this is a huge opportunity to bring together
 effectively three generations of Rock fans, from people who were
 into rock in the 70's and got into Maiden. Then you have all the
 people who have got into the band in the 80's and now a whole
 generation from the 90's. We're looking at another century of people.
 It's marvellous as I think that, certainly for me, I don't want to
 live up to people's expectations: I want to exceed them.

 Steve Harris: It's difficult to say, but I think they will be excited
 about it, especially the young fans even more so as Adrian left the band
 8 years ago. So there's a lot of fans that haven't seen either one or
 both of them. It's really exciting.

 Dave Murray: The fans that are from the 80's, it's going to spark that
 excitement back again and get them interested again in a way, if they
 had decided to move onto other things. The old fans are going to be
 like "Yeah - let's go and check it out" and also the new fans - looking
 at the stuff on the Internet, and the general vibe - it looks like
 they're really excited about this anyway. These fans have never seen
 this line up - there's going to be a lot of excitement, and you can
 feel the buzz already.

 Janick Gers: I think the kids who are into the band are really going to
 accept this, because there's been a grand swell of support for Bruce
 over the years, anyhow, and he's got a great voice. It's going to be
 very exciting and I think the people who are going to come to see it
 (I think there's a lot of people out there who haven't actually seen
 Iron Maiden with Bruce Dickinson in) are going to be very, very excited.
 From a fan point of view, I think you've got the best of both worlds.
 You've got the Iron Maiden of the 90's with Bruce in there, giving it
 everything, and he hasn't been there for a while, so he's going to be
 well fired up.

 Adrian Smith: Well, we do get a lot of feed back from the Internet and
 there have been constant rumours for the last couple of years of a
 reformation of the 80's line up. A lot of feed back on that, so I think
 a lot of people are going to want to see it, simply because I've been
 out on the road with Bruce for the last couple of years, and from what
 I have gathered on the road, people will be very interested to hear it.
 I think it's going to be really cool, because of the atmosphere between
 us. There's a good feeling about this tour and you can sense the
 anticipation and the buzz about it.

 Nicko McBrain: I think the fans will be absolutely ecstatic. There's
 going to be some people who will be upset as they were in to Blaze,
 but I think once they see the reformed band as it is, they'll be
 probably very happy about things - it's still Maiden - I think they're
 going to be as excited as we are As far as what the kids will think;
 I think they'll be really happy.


@{b} 4) We understand you've done a photosession which was probably the first
    thing you've done since getting back together. How did it go?@{ub}

 Bruce Dickinson: You know you're back in Iron Maiden when you get
 sandwiches and beer. No other photo session where they ever provide
 anything! Seriously though it was very easy. Being with the guys and
 Ross Halfin taking pictures it was just the same as ever. It really
 felt like we'd been on holiday and just got back after a couple of
 weeks. It's scary! Time travel!

 Steve Harris: Really normal. Really natural. It felt right. It didn't
 feel strange or anything like that - it felt really good.

 Dave Murray: It was a case like we'd never been apart! It felt like the
 band had never split in loads of directions. It was very natural - very
 comfortable - and there was a spark there and a glimmer in everyone's
 eyes. You felt that something special was happening there. It was as
 though we hadn't really parted. Bruce just did that photosession, just
 like we'd had a couple of months off. It didn't feel like 5 years at
 all. It just felt like a couple of months. Which is great because it
 shows that that magic is still there.

 Janick Gers: Yeah, it was very weird, the photosession, because,
 obviously that was the first time we all got together. I mean, I've
 known Adrian for a long time anyhow, but the actual 6 of us together.
 You know when you walk into a room, you feel a chemistry with the
 people you're with, and I must say, I felt a really good atmosphere
 when I walked into the room, and it held right through the photoshoot.
 Fun was had. There was definitely a kind of electricity between the
 characters in the band and if we can get that into the music and get
 it on stage; I think the chemistry between the 6 of us could be very
 exciting.

 Adrian Smith: It went really well, apart from the fact I had flu.
 It went very well. There's a lot of peripheral stuff you have to do,
 but it was actually fun and painless, and that's the highest praise
 you can give to a photosession! More importantly, it was a chance for
 us all to meet up and hang out for a couple of hours and we started to
 scratch the surface talking about the musical side of things. I think
 you need the chemistry as the band is made up of such personalities and
 that makes it what it is.

 Nicko McBrain: It was great - as I said earlier - it was as though we
 just walked in and picked up from we'd just walked off stage and off
 the end of a tour the previous week. It really was. It was really just
 a question of a bunch of old mates, getting together who hadn't had a
 drink up for a while! Although we were talking about making a new album,
 making music, but that was the general feel. Very good. Everyone had a
 great time and a bit of a chuckle. There wasn't any tension in the air,
 even at the beginning. It was just "Oh! Here we are. OK, let's get on
 with it. What do we want to do now". It was a great day and we got an
 awful lot done. You think it would be absolute chaos because of everyone
 getting together for the first time for 7 or 8 years, but we got a lot
 of work done and we thoroughly enjoyed it, as we normally hate
 photosessions, but it went really well.
