(1) Introduction

Budget travel in Japan is a relative term. It is possible to travel
cheaply in Japan, if you define cheap as less expensive than most
people travel.  The stories about $5.00 cups of coffee and $150 taxi
rides from the airport into Tokyo are true, but you can get to Tokyo
from Narita Airport for $10.00, and the $5.00 coffee is at a nice
coffee shop in Tokyo where you can actually sit down for a while,
relax, and listen to music -- something not easy to do in Tokyo for
free.

This information is written primarily for a non-Japanese tourist
travelling in Japan. It is not primarily for a foreign resident. For
that reason, there are descriptions of how to get from city A to town
B, but not how to buy a commuter pass for the trains; how to find a
place to stay for the night, but not how to find an apartment.

It's also written primarily for the non-Japanese speaking traveller,
even though there are notes included that are of interest only to
people who can speak or read Japanese. I, the editor speak enough
Japanese to make hotel reservations over the phone, but it's not
fluent. My ability, or lack thereof, has certainly slanted my opinions
of what's easy, difficult, or impossible.

I've taken information here from past articles posted to usenet,
adding the authors to the contributors list if I've still got that
info, Japan National Tourist Organization (JNTO) publications, JTB
publications, and my own (still limited) experiences in Japan.  Not
everything written in the first person ("I") was written by me.

I've tried to include dates on things that may change like phone
numbers, addresses and prices. Remember that they're all variable.
Some, like the Kyoto Tourist Information Center are unlikely to change
often, but a few years ago, all phone numbers in Tokyo got an extra
'3' added at the beginning. I've tried to quote prices in Yen, but an
occasional U.S.  dollar may slip through. If so, your guess is as good
as mine about the exchange rate.

(2.1) Outside Japan

The Japan National Tourist Organization ( JNTO ) has offices in
several U.S. cities. They can supply a collection of maps, pamphlets,
and other information that can be very useful including:


Calendar Events in <current month>
Economical Travel in Japan--Tips for Budget Travellers
Japanese Inn Group
Minshukus in Japan
Pensions in Japan
Railway Timetable (English, express trains only)
Reasonable Accomodations in Japan
TIC Tourist Information Centers
Travelling Companion: Japan
Your Guide to Japan
Youth Hostel Listing

The Japan Youth Hostel organization also publishes a YH book that is
reported more useful than the JNTO book even though in Japanese only.
See the section on lodgings for more info.

They also have maps of the larger cities and brochures on many more
rural areas. The more specific you can make your information request,
the more useful information they will send. If you ask for specific
areas, like climbing Mount Fuji, or the area around Ise, they can
probably be very helpful.

(2.2) Inside Japan

There are three Tourist Information Centers specifically geared toward
foreign tourists, in Narita Airport, Tokyo, and Kyoto.  TICs are open
9:00 am to 5:00 pm weekdays, 9:00 am to noon on saturday and closed
sunday.  The Narita TIC is open 9:00 am to 8:00 pm every day.

The TIC in Narita's Terminal 1 (the old terminal) has been closed.
The hours above are for the Terminal 2 office located in the arrival
lobby.

The Tokyo TIC is near the Yurakucho station on the Yamanote line, one
station south of Tokyo. They have most everything the overseas JNTO
offices have, and probably more. They also can recommend places to
stay in Tokyo. They won't however, call the hotels for you, a
potential problem if your Japanese is limited.


Narita Airport (Terminal 2)		            (0476)34-6251

6-6 Yurakucho 1-chome Chiyoda Ku Tokyo       (03)3502-1461

Kyoto Tower Building, Higashi Shiokojicho
shimogyo ku Kyoto                            (075)371-5649


The Kyoto TIC is, in my opinion, more organized, at one time they
would call the hotels, but I've heard they won't do that any more.  I
was last in Kyoto in 1987, so somebody please send more recent
information.

Neither TIC is really geared for the budget traveler. They will often
steer westerners to western style hotels with English speaking staff
unless they have a pile of money for a really nice ryokan. They do
have information on cheaper places and can help, you may have to ask
once or twice for something cheaper.

Teletourist Service of the TIC in Tokyo and Kyoto gives taped
information of current events in Tokyo or Kyoto. Tokyo: 3503-2911
(english) or 3503-2926 (french) Kyoto: 361-2911 (english). This
information is from March 1987.

Japan Travel Phone is a nationwide toll-free service operated by
JNTO.  It's available 9am to 5pm daily. Call 0120-222800 for
information on eastern Japan, 0120-444800 for western Japan.  Within
Tokyo, a local call: 3502-1461 or 371-5649 in Kyoto. This information
is from March 1987.

There is an English-language rail information service in Japan: it is
called JR East Infoline and the number is 03 (Tokyo) 3423-0111.  This
information is from May 1995.

Most large towns have some kind of tourist information center, but are
geared mostly toward Japanese nationals traveling in Japan. You may
not find English speaking staff (but you might!  In 1990, a woman who
spoke very good English worked at the Matsumoto TIC in Nagano
prefecture). Depending on how often foreign tourists arrive, they may
be a little perplexed about finding you an appropriate place to stay,
but they can be useful.

If an area gets foreign tourists every now and then, and most do now,
the TIC likely to have some list of places to stay which are more or
less willing and accostumed to having non-Japanese guests, and
probably won't normally send non-Japanese anywhere else. The TICs in
Tokyo and Kyoto are like this too.  This can be either positive or
negative depending on what your Japanese abilities are and what kind
of travel experience you're looking for in Japan.

You can go to JTB offices, or any other travel agent, for
transportation or hotel reservations. They aren't likely to represent
many budget hotels, and you can't count on anybody there speaking
anything but Japanese.

(2.3) Guidebooks

The Lonely Planet guide is more or less the standard for budget travel
in Japan, and many other countries. A 4th edition has been released in
1991 which is said to be much better than the previous edition. Moon
Publishing's "Japan Handbook" by J.D. Bisignani is also good, a new
edition was released recently (1995).  These two references mostly
overlap, so there's not a big reason to have both. The author of the
Moon book seems more enamored with rural Japan than the author of the
*old* LP edition.  [I have only the old moon guide, but have looked
through the new one, and the new LP in bookstores, they still seem
pretty much equivalent - ed.]

There are also Fodor's and several other guide books that can be found
in just about any decent bookstore in the U.S.  These tend to not be
oriented toward the budget traveller.

There are at least two series of guidebooks published in Japanese, the
Ace Guides, (E-su Gaido) published by JTB, they have good information
on sights and recomended itineraries, but no special budget travel
information. The Blue Guides are pretty similar. JTB also publishes
several guides which may be of interest, Pensions, Kokumin Shukusha,
Minshuku, Business Hotels, and Hot Springs. These guides are available
at some of the Kinokuniya Bookstores in the U.S.  For example: San
Francisco has many, Seattle, just a few.

There are specialty books on specific areas - lots on Tokyo and Kyoto,
some on other areas around Japan - in both English and Japanese. A
traveller who wants to limit to a specific area might find the
information in these guides more complete.

The web page

   http://www.ntt.jp/japan/

has some good general information about Japan, including a section on
Tourist Information.  It includes a link to JNTO, and a HTML version
of their booklet "Your Travel Companion - Japan".  It's basically the
same information JNTO sends in the mail, but it's a start.

The Railway Technical Research Institute has some information on the
Japanese Rail system at http://www.rtri.or.jp/index.html, but it's not
really geared toward travellers.

There is an office of the Japan Railways group in New York City, with
an E-mail address of japanrail@aol.com.

(3) Transportation Around Japan

For most long distance travel in Japan, trains are often the best
choice.  There are also busses, planes, and ferries, but in most cases
the trains are faster, cheaper, and more frequent.

In Tokyo, as well as some other cities, it often pays to buy a full
day subway ticket.  One contributer writes that in Tokyo, an all day
pass runs about the same as three one way tickets.  Prices are
reported on the ticket machines - in Japanese.  [I've never bought
one, so no more details yet - ed]

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Train" "Train Schedules"
@NEXT "Pass"
@PREV "Trans"
@TOC "MAINfaq"
(3.1) Train Schedules

JNTO offices and TICs have a book of train schedules in English for
the entire country.  It's about 30 pages and covers the long distance
express trains only. The book that lists all train schedules (and
busses, ferries, and planes) is the size of a telephone book and in
Japanese only. Many local TICs will have a smaller express schedule
for the local line in English.

If you can read Japanese, the big train schedule can be a tremendous
help. The index is a big map of Japan, so if you can read the names of
the places you want to go, finding the links between them should be
not too difficult even if your reading is only marginal.  But you will
need some readinig ability.  The Japanese name is "Jikokuhyou".
Matching Kanji with no Japanese reading ability is possible too, but I
think it would get tedious pretty quickly.

The JR train types are, in order of decreasing speed and expense.

Japanese Name       Official Translation    
Shinkansen          super express           (the "bullet" trains)
Tokkyuu             limited express
Kyuukou             express
Kaisoku             rapid
Futsuu              local

Kaisoku and futsuu cost the standard JR fare based on distance. The
other types have a suplement added based on distance and the type of
train.  In 1993 the "nozomi" Shinkansen began operation on the line
between Tokyo and Osaka. I don't know if its fares are higher.
"Bullet" is not used in Japanese to describe the Shinkansen, that's a
foreign (maybe just American) description.  If you look up "bullet" in
an English-Japanese dictionary (dangan) and ask for that at a train
station, the results are unpredictable.

(3.2) The Japan Rail Pass

The Japan rail pass is for those entering Japan on a tourist visa or
(reportedly) Japanese citizens who are permanent residents abroad and
visiting Japan. [I can only verify the tourist visa, don't blame me if
you're a Japanese citizen and have trouble with a JRP - ed.] It is not
usable by those living in Japan, and I've heard of passport checks,
especially when buying tickets for long distance trains. It allows
unlimited travel on JR trains, busses, and ferries. Sleeping cars and
a few extra cost options are either not available or cost extra.  The
fastest "Nozomi" Shinkansen has been reported as one of the "not
available" trains.  Reports are that sleeping cars are OK, just pay the
difference that the sleeping car costs over the normal ticket, and you
get no credit towards a Nozomi ticket.

Note that most busses and ferries are not JR.  Where reserved seats
are available, reservation charges are included in the JR pass. I've
heard stories about the JR pass being no good for a couple of JR
ferries, but have no details. I would expect it to be the case if only
private sleeping rooms are available on the ferry.

You should note that you have to purchase the Exchange Order for the
JRP outside Japan.  Your friendly JNTO office will be able to provide
some travel agencies which sell the Exchange Order.  This Exchange
Order can be exchanged for the real JRP at special exchange offices,
located at 16 major JR stations. At this occasion you have to show
your passport to validate your temporary visitor status.  Passports or
other ID are not generally checked after that point, but they might
be.

the JR pass comes in 1, 2, and 3 week versions, and last I checked
(August 1993), the JR pass was 27800, 44200, 56600 yen for the 1, 2,
and 3 week respectively in the ordinary version which is good enough
for most human beings.  A round trip Shinkansen ticket from Tokyo to
Osaka is about 26,000 yen, Hiroshima is 37,000 and Hakata (Northern
Kyushu) is 42,000 (july 1991). That can give a general idea of some of
the distance you need to travel before the pass starts to pay off.

There is also a green car version if you must go first class.  The
seats are larger with more legroom and probably TV service at your
seat.  The regular class is just fine unless you're really big by
American standards.  I have no complaints with the regular seats on
shinkansen and express trains at 183cm tall (six feet for those of us
still measuring in the middle ages).

If you're going to use a major city as a base for lots of short or day
trips, think twice about the JR pass, in many cases private lines run
the same trip cheaper and faster than JR.

                                    enoden railway.  See, the private lines
                                    aren't _always_ better.


You can find similar examples between many of the interesting places
around Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Ise.

Also, the JR pass is not good for Tokyo or Osaka subways.

The point I'm trying to make in all of this is consider also the cost
in time or added tickets when you're evaluating if the JR pass is a
good deal for you.  In my last three trips to Japan, it was great
once, and twice it would have been a bad deal.  The first time, I went
as far as Hiroshima then back to Tokyo, the other times, I didn't
cover as much terriroty.  Your own itinerary is the only way to
determine if the JR pass is a good deal or not.

If you can read Japanese, do what I did, and get the telephone book
sized timetable and figure out your major travels and their cost and
if you would really use JR for a particular link. If you're near even,
get the pass anyway just for convenience.  You might also find that it
would work well for say, one week of a two week trip, and in the other
week you wouldn't use it enough to make up the difference between the
one week and two week passes.

One more point to consider: If you have, say a week in Japan, arrive
on Saturday and leave the following Saturday. That's 8 days by the
reconning for the valid periods of a JR pass. Give a little thought if
you want to have the pass valid the first day or the last day of your
trip since you can't have both.  Most flights from the U.S. arrive in
the late afternoon, and unless you're covering a lot of ground on that
first day, you probably won't want to activate the pass for your
arrival day.

@TOC "MAINfaq"
(3.3) Local Trains

If you don't have a JR pass, you'll probably do more travel by local
trains than express. It is possible to get from Tokyo to Osaka by
local train in less than 10 hours for about 8,000 yen, but the ticket
seller will probably think you're crazy when you buy the ticket. The
shinkansen does the same trip in 3 hours for about 13,500 yen. This is
obviously an extreme case, but for trips of two hours or so on a local
train, the cost difference percentage is larger and the time savings
is smaller.  Shinjuku to Koufu is 124 km and by limited express takes
about 90 minutes for 4610 yen, A local train does it in about 150
minutes for 2160 yen. A Kaisoku runs on holidays only but takes about
105 minutes for the same 2160 yen. 

Decide what your time is worth, or how long you want to sit and look
out the window, or how long you don't want to sit and look out the
window.  Don't forget that on futsuu and kaisoku trains, you don't
generally have reserved seats.  If it's crowded, you may stand the
whole way too.

Schedules are posted at train stations and published in the big
timetable, rarely in any language but Japanese.

Keep in mind that around Tokyo and the entire area between Nagoya and
Osaka, private trains may very well go where you want faster and
cheaper than JR. The previous section on the JR pass mentions a couple
of the options.

(3.4) Youth 18 Ticket

[from a contributer -ed.]
Another discount for travelling on the trains in Japan, at least
during the summer months, is the "Youth 18" ticket.  It is only
available within Japan, and is valid from the 23rd of July to some
time at the end of August; and also around Christmas/New Year for
about a month.  The tourist office should have the exact dates.  You
buy the tickets at railway stations in Japan. They are intended for
students to travel during school vacations. There may be age limits.

You get 5 tickets; each gives you a day's ride on any JR local train
for around 2500 Yen, for any distance.  This means you can go from
Tokyo to Kyoto for 2500 Yen, one fifth of the Shinkansen fare.  Also,
there is an overnight local train from Tokyo to Kyoto and vice versa,
so you can save a night's accomodation by taking it.  This train is
packed with Japanese students also taking advantage of the cheap
ticket, and the trains aren't as comfy as the super-express.


@ENDNODE

@NODE "Buses" "Buses"
@NEXT "Ferries"

@TOC "MAINfaq"
(3.5) Busses

There are some long distance busses. Using the Tokyo to Osaka route as
an example, the "Dream Bus" is reported to be pretty nice. It leaves
Tokyo at about 9:00 or 10:00 PM and arrives in Osaka at 6:00 or 7:00
the next morning for about 8,500 yen. The large timetable has 6 pages
of these long distance overnight busses, when you consider that it's a
place to sleep for the night, depending on how well you sleep on a
bus, they can be pretty economical. If you don't sleep well in such
places, being wiped out for a while after a sleepless night might not
be worth the savings.

There are also local busses that go all over the place. Except Kyoto,
schedules and routes are difficult to find in any language other than
Japanese. Most, but not all, busses are boarded at the middle door
where you will find a ticket dispenser.  The ticket will have a number
on it.  If you get on at the beginning of the line, you don't get a
ticket. Up by the driver is a board with prices and numbers that
correspond to the fare for each ticket number, or the highest fare is
for no ticket.  The fares, as you might expect, increase the farther
you ride from the place you got on the bus. When you get off, exit
through the front door and drop your ticket and the correct fare into
the fare box next to the driver. Many of the fare boxes also have
bill changers built in to them, but you drop correct change into the
box itself.

Kyoto busses have a fixed fare that you can pay with money or with
tickets from a vending machine.  Popular tourist stops have
announcements in English. Bus routes are numbered, and maps in English
are available at the TIC. The MAINfaq caveat is that some of the routes
are circular, and the clockwise and counterclockwise busses have the
same number.  You'll get where you want eventually, but might get a
long tour like I did on my first Kyoto bus ride.

(3.6) Ferries

[from a contributor - ed] 
The ferry system is good and cheap, particularly some of the
less-travelled, like the Shin-Nihonkai ferry from Tsuruga/Maizuru to
Otaru (Hokkaido).  If you have time, this takes 30 hours and will get
you from Kansai to Hokkaido for around 5,000 yen, second class.  There
is no reason to book a higher class.  The ships have cafeterias, a TV
lounge, a coin laundry, (sometimes) a karaoke bar...  a wonderful view
of the coast, and clean, crisp air.  And you can move!  Friendly
people, too.

The ships make their money by carring trucks and cars, with passenger
areas on the upper deck.  The point here is that they are BIG ships,
quite seaworthy, and (from dizzying experience) give a safe ride, even
in a typhoon.  They are my long-distance transportation of choice,
though sadly, passengers services are dying out.

There are dormitory places in Tokyo where you can stay for 1,000 yen
per night -- if there's a vacancy. [can anybody supply an address??
-ed.]  Tani House in Tokyo and Uno House in Kyoto are old favorites,
and ran about 1500 yen in 1993.  No meals, but there are kitchens.
You can also stay in some very nice ryokan in Kyoto for 3500 per
person (meals extra). [I've also received one strong recomendation
AGAINST Tani House - ed.]

There are much fewer really cheap places to stay in Japan like there are
in Europe or the poorer countries of Asia. A youth hostel is one of
the cheapest and it's in the 3,000 ~ 3,500 yen range with two meals.
There are both private and public youth hostels, no membership is
required for the public places. JNTO has a youth hostel list.

[From a contributer, not my personal experience. - ed]
With a few notable exceptions (Yoyogi in Tokyo, Sapporo House in
Sapporo) I have found Japanese Youth Hostels to be excellent -- far
above average and an excellent value.  There are more youth hostels in
Japan than in any other country in the world.  It is worthwhile to buy
a YH membership in your home country -- it's kind of expensive here.
Some hostels even give special discounts to foreign guests!  The food
is often very good, too, especially in small hostels where, in the off
season, you end up eating with the family that runs it.  They are
great places to meet people, even if you speak no Japanese, because
students often stay there.  I've made a lot of friends that way.

I haven't seen the JNTO list of hostels.  There is an excellent book
published annually by the Japanese hostels.  It gives a map and all of
the usual YH symbols for what you can expect, plus some Japanese
extras, like whether or not there's a hot spring available.  The book
runs about 1,000 yen, or is included with membership if you join here.
Sheet rental is 100 yen per night (you can bring your own to avoid
this fee).  Most standard YH rules apply, but not as strictly as other
places I've been.  Excellent value.

[back to me - ed]
A Minshuku is a small inn, usually Japanese style, where, to quote the
official line, "The visitor is made to feel like one of the family."
I've never felt like one of the family, but I have stayed in nice
Minshuku.  Meals are usually included, prices are about 6500 yen per
person. JNTO publishes a list of minshuku which are more or less
accustomed to having foreign visitors. Some of the Minshuku on the
list are more like small business hotels. Other minshuku owners may be
warry about foreigners, and may even refuse to allow foreigners, but a
minshuku is just about the most pleasant way to stay relatively
cheaply in Japan.  [editor's opinion here] I've found the smaller the
place, the more likely the owners are to spend time being friendly.
The JNTO list includes how many rooms each minshuku has. There are
guides published in Japanese that list location, cost, types of meals,
construction, etc. of minshuku all over the country. Minshuku are more
common away from large cities.  Small cities (population "only" a few
hundred thousand) may have several. Local tourist information offices
in smaller cities will often be able to make minshuku arrangements
when you arrive in town. A one or two day notice is probably better.

Anything written here about a Minshuku probably applies to a cheap
ryokan also. I haven't figured out the difference between the two
in many cases. 

Business Hotels are basic, no-frills hotels. Many of the rooms have
only a twin bed with basic other furnishings. There might be at TV,
it may also cost 100 yen per hour to watch it. Business hotels are
usually in larger cities, especially around major train stations.
Prices vary according to location more than anything. The more
convenient to a major train station, the more expensive they get.
Many of the places listed in JNTO's "Reasonable Accomodations in
Japan" are business hotels.

Some temples have lodging available, known as shukubo. I've never
stayed in one of these, but would like to. I don't know of any
references or where to find temples that accept guests. In Wakayama
prefecture, Mt. Koya is the site of the headquarters of the Shingon
sect of Buddhism. There are many shukubo on Koya san.

Pensions are named after the European Pensions, although you might
find that they are more like a western-style Minshuku.  Prices are in
the range of 7,000 to 11,000 yen a night and include dinner and
breakfast.  Most pensions are architecturally similar to western style
houses with the bedrooms on the second floor, a playroom and dining
room on the first floor, a shared toilet and a Japanese style common
bath.  The dinner hour and breakfast hour are usually fixed; I've
found 8:00 to 9:00 is common for breakfast and 6:00 to 7:00 for
dinner.  Newer pensions feature one or more of the following: "French"
or "Nouvelle Cuisine" dinners, tennis courts, sometimes special
activities related to the owner's interests such as para-gliding,
horse-back riding, baking pastries, etc.  There are guides published
in Japanese that list location, cost, types of meals, and special
features of pensions all over the country.  Pensions are common near
"resort" areas near the sea, the lakes or the mountains.

A Kokumin Shukusha is a hotel that has some kind of government
affiliation in its management. They are often in rural resort areas.
They are relatively inexpensive, starting around 7500 yen per person
with two meals. The rooms and other facilities are much better than
the price might indicate. Meals are at fixed times in a large dining
room, there may be an announcement over the hotel's PA system that
it's time to come and get it. I have stayed at one Kokumin Shukusha,
in 1993, and it was very nice for my 7700 yen or so. The usual way to
make reservations is book and pay ahead at a travel agent, but it is
possible to book directly by phone. I called from the U.S. which was
unusual for the place, they wanted an address to send a confirmation,
but my Japanese or their English was not enough to explain an American
address.

If you have any religious affiliations (Christian, Buddhist, etc.)
most "international" denominations/sects/etc. will house their
"members" for a small fee (or even free) at the local church, temple,
etc. or at a local member's home.  There may be other international
groups which offer similar hospitality, so check with your
affiliations.


There are other somewhat more offbeat places to stay including:

Capsule Hotels: you get a tube with a bed to sleep on and TV to watch.
They're cheap, about 2400 to 4000 yen, and mostly near major train
stations in major cities. The price seems determined mostly by how
close to how big a train station. Many (most??) capsule hotels won't
accept women as guests, they have one restroom, bath, etc. only. Most
of the guests are businessmen who missed the last train home.

Kenkou Rando, "health land."  They're MAINfaqly found out from the centre
of town, and are huge overgrown bath-houses, which include baths
(obviously) of many types, often with Chinese medicines. The standard
Kenkou Rando also has a cinema (I've seen 20,000 Leagues under the
Sea!!), a restaurant, children's playrooms, karaoke, etc, etc. You
have to pay extra for food etc, and often it will be put on your "key"
number for you to pay when you leave. At midnight, they turn the movie
off, and (in the places I've visited) the seats in the cinema can be
reclined, you can take a blanket from a pile and sleep. The standard
price in 1990 was ~1500 yen, with a small surcharge (~250yen) if you
stayed overnight. The most expensive stay I've had in Kenkou Rando was
2000 yen, but this place had some amazing features.

Love Hotels...  one of Japan's most useful institutions.  Of course
you can spend the night there, even if you are alone, though the
proprietor might worry a bit.  Couples will obviously be welcome --
mostly.  Some aren't keen on having overnight guests who don't fit the
standard profile...  But if you can't find someplace else and
particularly if it's late at night they might give you a room for
6,000 or so.

If you want to put them to the use for which they are intended, you
can see some rather charming aspects of Japanese culture.  A standard
room comes with a bed, table, radio, television, X-rated videos, a
stocked refrigerator, bath, toilet, garish lighting and decoration.
There is a lot of variation.  Some nice ones have very large baths,
with windows, and assorted other accessories.  They often go to
hilarious lengths to protect the privacy of their guests.  Note that
there is also a "service time," during the day, maybe 10-5, when you
can stay for about 3,500 for the whole period -- bring food and stay
for the day...

-- from a second source --

My husband and I like to just get in the car and go on a trip.
Sometimes that means arriving in a town late in the evening and not
being able to find a cheap minshuku.  When that happens, we look for
one of those buildings with the garish neon lights and the curtained
parking entrances.  Love hotels seem to be located everywhere! and
they always seem to have vacancies at night.  They let you stay from
10:00 p.m. to (I think) 9:00 in the morning for something like 10,000
to 15,000 yen for two.  Unlike minshuku, you get a private bath and
toilet and a double bed to boot! :) (Apparently, they look at you a
little strangely if you are alone or if you are with a friend of the
same sex.)

(4.1) Hotel Information and Strategy

JNTO has lists of hotels that are fairly accustomed to foreign
tourists.  They state that English is spoken at all the places they
list, but don't depend on it.

Most train stations in tourist areas have a hotel information office
and/or a tourist information office.  For budget lodgings like
minshuku try the tourist information first.  If both of these offices
exist, they might be two people sharing the same window, but they'll
give out different information.  The hotel information office is more
likely to send you to a business hotel than a minshuku.  The prices of
the two might be similar, but the minshuku is (in my experience)
usually more pleasant.

(5) Food

Food in Japan can be reasonable, but can also break the bank if you
don't watch out. Good general advice for trying to stay on a budget is
eat Japanese style and avoid western food. Japanese food easily gets
as expensive as western, but it generally gets cheaper.  This section
has some rather sweeping generalizations about where and what to eat,
treat them as such.

If eating at cheap places, avoid beef. Good beef in Japan is very good
and very expensive. Cheap beef is often not very good and pork,
chicken, fish, or shrimp is usually a much better value.

Noodles are one of the more economical meals in Japan. The standard
dish is noodles in a pork broth topped with assorted vegetables,
tenpura or meat. Dishes generally run about 500 - 1500 yen. Various
regions of Japan tend to specialize in particular noodle types--soba
in the central mountain district, especially Nagano prefecture; udon
in kagawa prefecture on Shikoku; and ramen in Kyushu.

Restaurants in department stores are often some of the cheaper places
to eat in a major city. Many stores have restaurants in both the
basement and on one of the top floors. If there are both, the basement
places are usually cheaper. Each restaurant will usually specialize in
one style of food, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, ... Nearly all of them
have models in the window so you can tell exactly what you're getting
and how much it costs. If you don't speak Japanese, you can always have
the wait person come out front while you point.

For a meal on the go, you can put together a good meal from the
various food shops in the basement of the big department stores. There
are often free samples that you can use to round out (or sometimes
even replace) a meal.

Wait until about one hour before closing time at department stores or
"large" supermarkets (esp. before their store "holiday" -- Tuesday or
Wednesday for most stores) and you'll see a lot of prepared food
marked down in price.

Check out shops around universities, since you can almost always find
cheap "teishoku" geared for students.

If you like sushi, try "kaiten zushi" - "revolving sushi". This is the
conveyor belt sushi where the chefs stand in the middle of the shop,
surrounded by counters with a circular conveyor belt that carries
small plates of sushi. Prices vary, and depend on the color of the
plate.  Kaiten zushi is about the lowest class of sushi, and it's not
the same atmosphere of a more traditional shop, but it's probably one
of the better sushi deals around. You can get take out sushi from the
food basement of most department stores, but the kaiten zushi is
fresher and probably no more expensive.

Supermarkets are not as good for the traveller as they are in the U.S.
There are fewer prepared foods in Japan, so if you want a meal of
fruit or raw vegetables, you can find that at a supermarket, but don't
expect a salad bar or burritos with a microwave to heat them up.

Lots of convenience stores now have prepared food and microwaves to
heat them.  This can save one's life (more experience).  But there is
hardly any good Mexican food at all...

There's always McDonalds.

(6) Etiquette

The general advice is just be friendly and polite, and for the most
part you'll do just fine in Japan. There are really only two areas
where you must follow the local customs, shoes and bathing.

As many people know, Japanese don't wear shoes in the house, or
schools, temples, and many other buildings. If you enter a building,
you may well see shelves or cubbyholes full of shoes, and maybe a
bunch of slippers either in a box or lined up inside the enterance.
This area is called a genkan. Just put your shoes in the shelves and
put on a pair of slippers, if they're available, otherwise just go on
in stocking feet. If there's no place to store your shoes, it's
_probably_ OK to keep them on your feet. Many tourist attractions that
have seperate entrance and exit give plastic bags and you carry your
shoes with you.

Once you're walking around the inn, house, whatever, be sure to take
off the slippers before you walk on tatami, the straw mats that cover
the floor in Japanese style rooms, the hallways are traditionally wood
planks, or now tile, linoleum, etc. Just remember nothing but socks on
the tatami.

When you go to the toilet, you may see a pair of ugly plastic slippers
when you open the door. They're often red or pink, and may have
"toilet" written in English. If so, leave your hall slippers outside
the door and put these slippers on while you do your business. Switch
back to the others when you leave the toilet.

If you take a bath in a bath shared by others, this may be your turn
alone in a small bathroom, or with many others in a large bath, the
important thing to remember is wash before you get in the bath tub,
and no soap in the tub.  The usual procedure is to leave your clothes
in the basket or cubby in the changing room, go into the bathroom (not
the toilet room, they've not related in Japan), wash and rinse
thoroughly, then go soak in the tub for as long as you like. When you
enter the bathroom, there will be a bunch of spigots, maybe hand held
shower heads, along at least one wall, that's where you do your
washing. The tub itself will hold somewhere between one person to one
thousand people.

Men tend to just rinse off with a couple of buckets full of water
before soaking in the tub for a little while, then getting out and
washing, then back for more soaking. I've been told women generally
keep to the traditional procedure. It's also considered polite to hold
your washtowel over your genitals when walking around the bath. I was
told at one time that you should wash above your waist with your right
hand, below with the left. Men tend to be more lax about following all
of these customs, I've been told by a friend that women tend to follow
them more closely.

Not following the customs with shoes or bathing can cause hard
feelings, they're some very strong traditions in Japanese culture. The
following points are things to keep in mind, but not get worked up
over. Blowing your nose is considered rather disgusting, especially if
you save the stuff in a handkercheif in your pocket or blow it in a
restaurant. A handkercheif is for drying hands or wiping your
forehead, not for preserving nasal mucus, carry a package of tissues.
People tend to dress nicely in cities, jeans are a little out of
place, shorts much more so. People don't eat while walking along the
street, you eat in a place that sells food. Couples don't generally
show much affection together in public.  Except nose blowing, these
points all seem much more relaxed around vacation areas, or even on
weekends in other places.

(7) Emergencies

Phone Numbers: The phone number to call an ambulance or fire truck (or
just report disaster) is 119. This is a free of charge number. You
just push the emergency button (it's red) at the bottom of the phone
and dial. The number for the police is also free of charge - it is
110. It's doubtful the person on the other end will speak any language
other than Japanese.

For directory assistance the number is 104, but you have to pay for
this one. Usually for one number they charge you 30 yen. If you are
using a telephone card the 30 yen is deducted automatically.

Police are generally pretty helpful. If you get lost, a police box -
they're everywhere in cities - is a good place to ask for directions.
If I arrived in some out of the way place totally at a loss where to
find a place to stay, I'd probably ask at the local police station.

(8) Money

Japan is traditionally a cash society, but that is changing, and the
pace of that change seems to be increasing. If you're eating and
staying at budget oriented places, it's still best that you don't
count on paying with credit cards. Business hotels usually accept
plastic, minshuku that do are rare, but increasing. In general, the
cheaper the place, the less likely your visa card will do any good.
Visa and Master Card both exist in Japan, but are not universally
interchangable like they are in the U.S. Visa seems slightly more
common, but this like many credit card things in Japan, may change.

It is illegal for a business to accept any currency other than
Japanese yen, so you will have to change your home currency into yen.
Not every bank is an authorized money changer, but those that are
generally have a sign in English at their front door to that effect.

You will get a better exchange rate for travellers' checks than cash.
(Cash requires more security than endorsed TCs) If you're traveling
from the U.S., exchange rates are (in all cases I've seen) better in
Japan than the U.S.  Probably the best exchange rate you'll find is if
you pay by credit card and the card company converts it - but your
company may vary. If you're spending at places that take plastic you
may want to use it. Banks all give pretty much the same rate, even the
banks at the airports. Very large hotels and department stores in very
large cities often have exchange counters and even their rates are
close to the banks, but slightly worse.

A reader from Spain, and another from Germany comment that their best
method was to carry TCs in Yen, so your best rate may vary depending
on what banks in your home country do.  U.S. banks don't like dealing
in anything but dollars, and their fees remind you of that.

You may find the exchange rate slightly better than TCs by getting
money from an ATM. The Cirrus network has locations in Tokyo, at
least. [I tried an ATM once, it rejected my card immediately after
asking for a number, don't know charges involved -ed] The prompts that
lead you through getting money are all in Japanese. If you use an ATM,
remember that many U.S. banks place a limit on daily withdrawals from
an ATM. If you don't arrange to increase the limit, an ATM can be a
poor source of cash in Japan. 

ATMs are getting more widespread all the time, but there are still
problems.  Japanese ATMs that say "Visa" on them do not accept
American Visa cards. The only exception to this are the special "Visa
International" ATMs that Visa has set up in Japan at Narita Airport
and a few other locations.  If you want a cash advance, you will
probably have to do it in person, and the teller will likely want you
to try the machine first.  

The Japanese banking system does require monumental patience at
times.  Sometimes, in remote locations you can be completely out of
luck since not every bank can even exchange money.  You may be able to
plead being an ignorant foreigner, and that may get you some help, but
it will take a long time with many hassels so plan ahead.  Be sure to
countersign travellers' checks exactly as the first signature. Deviation
can lead to problems.

The crime rate is quite low, but probably increasing. Pickpocket crime
is reported to be increasing, along with burglary, so limit cash or
carry it in less obvious places and leaving cash in a hotel room might
not be the best idea.  Japanese out travelling often take lots of cash
with them. Unless you tend to loose things, you might want to do the
same.  I see a lot of fanny packs in tourist areas.  In cities men
often carry a small zip up case with wallet and such while women
usually carry purses.

My strategy is usually get travellers' checks in U.S. dollars, and
exchange about a week's worth into yen at a time.  Try your best to
avoid converting money into yen then back into your home currency when
you leave. You loose on exchange rates twice that way.  Try to plan
banking ahead of time.  Foreign exchange banks exist out in the
country, but might be hard to find.

(9) Luggage Delivery and Storage

Travelling light is one key to a pleasant trip in Japan. Very little
public transportation has allowance for large suitcases. A good
guideline that's only a little restrictive is if you can't carry it on
an airplane, it's too big to haul around Japan on public
transportation.

There are luggage forwarding services in the Tokyo area that will ship
baggage between Narita and Tokyo. If you are staying in one place long
enough - it takes about a day - you can send everything from Narita
directly to your first hotel, and only carry enough supplies for that
first night. One such company is "ABC Kouku Tenimotsu Service" at 
(03)3545-1131. They have reportedly English speaking personnel on the
phones. They don't have English speakers at the airport.

Luggage storage is often available while you take a one or two day
trip elsewhere. If you return to the same lodging, they may often hold
your luggage for the time you're gone. Storage is also available in
many large train stations. Coin lockers usually have a limit of 3 to 5
days or so, but after that time, they don't throw your stuff away,
they just move it somewhere else and you have to bail it out for
approximately the coin locker price. In metropolitan areas, coin
lockers often have a LED display of the price. As you shove in 100 yen
coins, the price counts down to zero, and you get the key. At about
2:00 a.m. a new day's rent is added on the display, and you'll need
that much to get the locker open when you come back.  Think ahead
about where you want to pick up your stuff.  Sometimes you'll want the
locker inside the paid area of the train station, some time you won't.

(99) Other Helpful Hints

Public restrooms are plentiful. You'll find them around tourist
attractions, train stations, and public parks, some with impressive
signs (in Japanese) that translate like "xx Township Municipal Public
Restroom".  In rural areas, don't be surprised if men and women use
the same restroom. They are rarely stocked with toilet paper or paper
towels. Carry a handkercheif to dry your hands, and little packets of
tissues for other parts of your anatomy.  If you need to find a place
that supplies these accessories, or want a western style toilet, a
fancy department store or hotel in a large city is your best chance,
probably your only chance.

A word about Japanese toilets is probably in order here.  Japan has
probably the most sophisticated toilet technology in the world, but a
budget traveller is more likely to find a squat type toilet than one
with water jet wash, blow dry, and urinalysis while you wait.  You'll
find a trough in the floor with a hood at one end.  Stand with a foot
on each side, squat down and do your thing. Some say this style is
more sanitary with no body contact, some say the position is better
for the job to be done. To others, it's undignified or comfortable.
Just be prepared.  Do lots of deep knee bends before your trip.

Public telephones ("Koushuu denwa") are also plentiful. Local calls
cost 10 yen for 3 minutes.  You'll get a warning beep when you're
close to being cut off.  You can put in lots of coins ahead of time
and the phone returns the unused money, but doesn't make change for
unused portions of a 100 yen coin. There are various colors of phones,
but the green ones are the most useful, they take telephone cards, and
the green phones with a gold faceplate can be used for direct dialed
international calls.  To dial an international call by KDD, dial 001 +
country-code + phone- number. The country code to the U.S. is 1. There
are cheaper long distance services, but KDD seems to work everywhere.
Operator assisted international calls are _expensive_.

A new type of public phone is the grey phones.  They have an LCD
display and can be used to call overseas.  They have a few other
convenience features also.  There is also a new competitor to NTT for
service INSIDE Japan with blue phones.  They are for use only within
Japan, and are very inconvienent because (since they aren't NTT
phones) they don't accept NTT cards, only coins (and some, VISA and
other credit cards).  However, if you're making a lot of calls within
Japan, their rates are cheaper than NTT's.

Telephone cards are handy for long distance calls, especially for
international.  100 yen at a time is deducted on international calls.
You can buy cards for 500 or 1000 yen just about everywhere. From
tourist attractions, they'll have interesting pictures. Japanese
collect them and give them as gifts.

Electricity is 100 volts 50hz in Eastern Japan, 60hz in western Japan.
The dividing line is the Oi river in Shizuoka prefecture about half
way between Tokyo and Nagoya.  The outlets fit standard 2 prong U.S.
plugs. Hair dryers or electric shavers will probably work, but they'll
be a little weak.  Don't forget the part about packing light when you
consider bringing electrical appliances.

There is no tipping in Japan.

establishments.  In this appendix, I list very brief info about some
of the places to stay that are included in the information JNTO
provides Establishments listed here are generally Japanese Inn Group

All of these places, by virtue of their JIG or JNTO listings, market
to foreign tourists. Most are regular inns or hotels, catering mostly
to Japanese guests, but a few market exclusively to foreign visitors.

This is not meant to be complete, it may also go out of date. I make

(B.1) Narita to Tokyo

The New Tokyo International Airport is about 60 Km from Tokyo.  There
is a wide variety of ways to get from Narita to Tokyo, for a variety
of prices.  I have only used the train, so bus and taxi information
are probably a little vague.

Both JR and Keisei run trains to Narita.  The cheapest is the Keisei
Tokkyu which goes to Ueno station.  This is a standard commuter train
with no special accomodation for suitcases, and costs about 1000 yen.
You'll normally get a seat because Narita is the start of the line.
The Tokkyu makes the trip in 75 minutes.  The Keisei Skyliner is
about 60 minutes, has reserved seats and presumably, more luggage
space.  The Skyliner is about 2000 yen.  

If you have a JR pass, or need to make a quick connection at Tokyo
station, the JR Narita Express goes there in 55 minutes, and has
reserved seats and luggage space.  If you're paying for it, it costs
around 3000 yen. There are cheaper JR trains, but they don't compete
well in speed or cost with Keisei.  If you're not using a JR pass, but
making Shinkansen connections at Tokyo station, the NEX might be cost
effective depending on how the combination with the Shinkansen ticket
works out.

There are busses to the Tokyo City Air Terminal (TCAT).  When you're
leaving Japan, you can check it at TCAT and be done with your luggage.

I don't know about arrival time.  TCAT is not particularly convenient
to subway lines in downtown Tokyo.

Shuttle busses run to several hotels in the downtown area.

Taxis cost a pile of money.

When you schedule transport out of Narita, count on at least one hour
to get through customs and immigration.  I would not recommend
reserving actual tickets from your home country for your arrival day
as it's hard to schedule things that precisely.  Unless it's a busy
period, reserved seats on most trains are available right up to
departure time.

I've heard varying reports on traffic from Narita to Tokyo.  Some say
driving is no slower than the train.  Others say it takes forever. In
general, the train is less affected by weather or traffic jams.

(B.2) Nagoya

A bus runs from Nagoya airport to the Nagoya Bus Center, presumably
near Nagoya station, for about 700 yen in about 45 minutes.  From
Nagoya station connections on JR and Kintetsu (a large private railway
that covers the Nagoya - Osaka region) are plentiful.  JR has
Shinkansen connections towards Tokyo, or to Kyoto.  To Osaka, the
Shinkansen is faster, but Kintetsu is much cheaper.  Kintetsu to
Kyoto is possible, but involves transfers, while the Shinkansen is
direct over a shorter route with faster trains.

transportation from the Kansai International Airport to Osaka and a
few surrounding cities.  The info is not reproduced here because I

(C) What To Do On a Short Layover at Narita

Many flights from the U.S. to other asian cities have layovers of
various lengths at the "Tokyo" International Airport in Narita. So
many people look for something interesting to do during that time.  

You can just stay in the international no man's land inside the
airport without going through entrance formalities.  This area can
be crowded, and is rarely comfortable.

Immigration can easily take one hour, but it depends on how many
people have arrived at the same time, or shortly before you.  With no
baggage to claim, customs can be faster, but count on about an hour
and a half before you're actually allowed to leave the airport.  Once
you enter the country through immigration, you have to exit through
passport control also. Give yourself another hour or more to handle
departure formalities.  I've heard stories of long waits at passport
control to leave, but have always breezed right through myself. You
will also have to pay the 2,000 yen facilities charge.

I would probably stay put inside the airport for a stop of anything
less than four hours. But then my shortest stopover at Narita has been
ten days, so different people will have different thresholds.  I do
not know if there are showers or any similar facilities for those
trapped inside the international area.

The city of Narita is very close by, the first stop out of the airport
on both the Keisei and JR lines, fares are probably less than 200
yen. (See section B.1) Narita San is a large Shingon temple which is
said to be nice for a visit. There are department stores near the
Narita train stations. I've read reports of a nice public bathhouse
for about 2000 yen.  It's rather expensive for a public bath, but I
love Japanese baths, and after a long flight in the super dry air of
an airplane, this might be my choice.

A little farther from Narita along both the Keisei and JR lines is the
city of Sakura.  I've heard nice things about the National History
Museum in Sakura, but have never been there.

If you choose to go to Tokyo, you will spend at least another hour
each way in something vaguely resembling an airplane (a train), not
something I would do in the middle of two long plane flights, but at
some point, a stopover becomes long enough that it's worth doing. A
good Tokyo guidebook is probably a better source than this for finding
something to your liking in Tokyo.  Asakusa or the Museums in Ueno
park are convenient from the Keisei station. The Ginza is convenient
to Tokyo station, but the trains to get there are more expensive or
slower (or both) compared to Keisei. For readers who like electronic
gizmos, Akihabara is about half way between Ueno and Tokyo stations.
