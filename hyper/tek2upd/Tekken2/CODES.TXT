These Codes were originally submitted to me by Rukes Kewl@aol.comwithout him I would have never heard of a couple things.I figured out a couple things that he left out that were essentialfor some of the codes.TEKKEN 2 CODES for the SONY PLAYSTATION---------------------------------------TO GET KAZUYA: Get all the sub-bosses (not including Roger/Alex), then chooseANY Sub-Boss and finish the game. KAZUYA will then become selectable.TO GET DEVIL/ANGEL: Beat the game with Kazuya and DEVIL will become selectable.To get ANGEL, when choosing DEVIL just use one of the Kick buttons.TO GET ROGER/ALEX: 	Make sure you have All sub-bosses, including DEVIL/ANGEL and KAZUYA.  Start an Arcade Mode game. When you get to the 3rd match, wait until the winning round for you.   Beat the opponent down untill around 5%  energy (about 1/2cm. of energy bar).  Then let your opponent do the same. Then quicky kill your opponent. 	You should hear GREAT!. 	The 4th match will be against Roger or Alex. 	Just beat whoever you fight against to get BOTH.BIG HEAD MODE 1 CODE: YOU MUST HAVE ALL CHARACTERS FOR THIS CODE TO WORK	Press & Hold SELECT right after you select your character.	Do this until the battle starts.	You now are Have a BIG HEAD and are chubbier. BIG HEAD MODE 2 CODE: YOU MUST HAVE ALL CHARACTERS FOR THIS CODE TO WORK	After you enter Big Head Mode 1 code, finish the match.	Before the next match starts, hold SELECT AGAIN for an even BIGGER head (Real High voice and Real Pudgy....alot like VF KIDS)!TO GET KAZUYAS PURPLE SUIT: We asked for it and NAMCO once again delivers.When you have EVERYONE (all sub-bosses, Kazuya, Roger/Alex, Devil/Angel) Select Kazuya with the START button for his Purple suit.WIRE FRAME BOXING: THIS IS THE COOLEST CODE!!!YOU MUST HAVE ALL CHARACTERS FOR THIS CODE TO WORKMake sure you have EVERY character. Before you select your character, hold the L1 and L2 buttons Select Your character. Make sure the buttons are held untill the match starts. You will appear as a green wireframe, with a behind your character view (looking through yourself, at the other opponent). It is tough to play, but if you are the type of person who played	PUNCHOUT or SUPER PUNCHOUT game in the arcadesOnce again thanks to RUKES KEWL@aol.com for these codes and the boys in VGL for absolutely convincing me to get the import copy.
