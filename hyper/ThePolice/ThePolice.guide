@node intro "Introduction"

                     @{fg shine}Introduction or why have I made it@{fg text}

 @{"I" link omnie}'ve  always been an old-music fiend.  For me good music ended (in general)
somewhere  about  early  90's.  Of course, there are some good or even great
bands  today, but it's not the same.  Today's music is full of computers and
fake-sounds.  Sure, the 80's is the era of synthesizers but they knew how to
use them ;)
 Despite  the  fact I love all that 80's rock, pop, new romantic etc. (don't
care about terminology) my favourite band dates back to punk revolution.  On
the  main  page  of  this  guide I described @{b}The Police@{ub} as the greatest band
ever.   You  can  have different oppinion (really?  ;)) but there's no doubt
that  @{b}The  Police@{ub} was one of these band with incredible wide range of styles
as you can find in their music rock, pop, jazz, punk and reggae (and more).
 So, enjoy their music and enjoy my tribut-guide. Have fun!

 One  more thing:  sometimes you can find two different dates describing the
same thing. It's simply because differences in the source materials.

@node stewart "Stewart Copeland"

                              @{fg shine}Stewart Copeland@{fg text}

 @{b}Stewart  Armstrong Copeland@{ub} was born on 16.07.1952 in Alexandria, Virginia,
USA.   His  father  was  famous  trumpeter  of  @{i}Glenn  Miller@{ui}  orchestra and
important  officer of CIA (here's the origin of band's name!).  He spent his
childhood  in  Cairo  and  Beirut,  where he learnt to play drums.  Later he
studied  in  Berkeley's University of California.  In 1972 his brother @{i}Miles@{ui}
asked  him to be "on-road artistic director" for @{i}Cat Iron@{ui} (he met @{i}Kim Turner@{ui}
then,  the  drummen  and,  later, soundman and co-manager of @{b}The Police@{ub}) and
then  @{i}Joan  Armatrading@{ui}.   After  that he joined reunited @{i}Curved Air@{ui}, but it
wasn't his dream as they were unable to produce something new and fresh (for
commercial  reasons).   During  their visit to Newcastle, @{i}Phil Sutcliffe@{ui}, the
rock  journalist,  took him to the concert of @{i}Last Exit@{ui}, where he met @{"Sting" link sting}.
The story of @{b}The Police@{ub} begins here.

@node sting "Sting"

                                   @{fg shine}Sting@{fg text}

 @{b}Gordon  Matthew  Sumner@{ub}  was  born on 02.10.1951 in Newcastle, England.  In
contrast  to  @{"Stewart" link stewart}'s  childhood,  he  grew up in hard climate of workers'
district.   He started his musical education when he was at Catholic grammar
school:   his uncle left him a guitar.  Later he listened to @{i}Charlie Mingus@{ui},
@{i}Thelonious  Monk@{ui}  (among  others)  and didn't like it too much (but hoped it
make  him  good).   In 1969 he started studies at university, but gave it up
and  spent  a couple of years as unskilled labor, bus driver etc.  Two years
later he sorted it out, became a teacher and started to play in local bands.
In  1974  (1972)  he,  with  three  members of @{i}The Newcastle Big Band@{ui} (@{i}Jerry
Richardson@{ui},  @{i}John  Hedley@{ui}  and  @{i}Ronnie Pearson@{ui}), formed @{i}Last  Exit@{ui}, recorded
a single, play some concerts and...  signed for @{i}Virgin@{ui}.  During one of these
concerts he met @{"Stewart Copeland" link stewart} and @{b}The Police@{ub} began.

 Unfortunately,  I  don't have too  much info  about @{b}Henri Padovani@{ub} (born on
13.10.1953 (or 1952), Bastia). He  left @{b}The Police@{ub} (on 10  or 12.08.1977) as

                                @{fg shine}Andy Summers@{fg text}

 @{b}Andrew James Somers@{ub} was born on 31.12.1942 in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire,
England.  When  he was 17, he joined @{i}Zoot Money's Big Roll Band@{ui} and then @{i}New
Animals@{ui}, spending most of his time touring the States.  After he returned to
Great  Britain  (in 1973) he became a sideman and played with (among others)
@{i}Neil Sedaka@{ui}, @{i}David Essex@{ui}, @{i}Kevin Coyne@{ui} and @{i}Eberhard Schoener@{ui}.  He even played
with  @{i}Mike Oldfield@{ui}  during  @{i}"Tubular Bells"@{ui} concerts. During @{i}Mike Howlett@{ui}'s
@{i}Gong@{ui}  concert  in  Paris  he,    @{"Sting" link sting}, @{"Stewart" link stewart} and Mike Howlett played as
@{"Strontium  90" link strontiu}.   He  liked  it  enough  to  join  them, on 25.07.1977 (or in

 In  this  section you can find information about gigs of @{b}The Police@{ub}.  I was
not  able  to find full list of their gigs, it's obvious.  So, you can treat
this  chapter as "introduction to".  If you have any info about concerts not
mentioned here, inform me. Thanx.
 One  more  -  any  names  appearing  in brackets means @{b}The Police@{ub} played as
support of mentioned artists or just with them - simply, they were not "star
of the night".

                                @{fg shine}Strontium 90@{fg text}

 Mike Howlett gave up playing in @{b}The Gong@{ub} in 1976 and decided to start a new
project  called  @{b}Strontium  90@{ub}.   He  asked @{"Sting" link sting} to sing in it and lined up
@{"Andy" link andy}.  Sting brought @{"Stewart" link stewart} with him and they started recording in February
1977.   They  played first concert in Paris at @{b}The Gong@{ub} reunion.  Recordings
from both studio and concert made cd called Police Academy. There's also one
"bonus" track - it's first recording of @{"Every little thing she does is magic" link everylit}
made on 4 track at Howlett's house.
 The line-up of this band was:
 @{fg shine}°@{fg text} Sting - lead vocals + guitar and bass
 @{fg shine}°@{fg text} Stewart Copeland - drums
 @{fg shine}°@{fg text} Andy Summers - guitars
 @{fg shine}°@{fg text} Mike Howlett - bass

 First of all - I'd like to thanks all of you for downloading my guide, for

 But  who's he?  Well, it's me ;) I'm Amiga user from Poland. If you want to
know  what  do  I  do with my computer, here it is:  I'm member of ATO (free
translations  of  software),  sometimes  I write soft myself and I also like
@{i}guide@{ui} format. @{"Here" link projekty} you can find list of my other projects.
 Of  course I'm not spending 24 h/day in front of my Amiga.  I do many other
things:  studying  (geography/cartography),  reading, taking photos, playing
and  watching  sports  and,  of course, listening to music.  In @{"this" link intro} section
you'll  find  more  about  my  favourites,  but it's not a surprise that @{b}The

                            @{fg shine}Plans for the future@{fg text}

 This guide is still alive  and I'm sure I'll update it. In future  versions
you can expect to find (more) info about:
· books (more);
· tracks recorded not as The Police (Schoener);
· singles  (at  least 3 singles are  missing, but I don't know date of their
  releases and symbol);
· more bootlegs;
· more web-like online version
 Also  I'll  try  to  check  some "controversial" facts and, in case they're
wrong,  fix  them (e.g.  what's a flipside for AM 365 single:  Synchronicity
or  Peanuts?).   If  you  find any mistake or have some info which you think
should be added to the guide - contact @{"me" link omnie}.

 I can't stand it for another day
 when you live so many miles away
 nothing here is gonna make me stay
 you took me over let me find a way

 I sold my house I sold my motor too
 all I want is to be next to you
 I'd rob a bank maybe steal a plane
 you took me over think I'm goin' insane

 what can I do
 all I want is to be next to you

 I've had a thousand girls or maybe more
 but I've never felt like this before
 but I just don't know what's come over me
 you took me over take a look at me

 what can I do
 all I want is to be next to you

 so many times I used to give a sign
 I got this feeling gonna lose my mind
 when all it is just a love affair
 you took me over baby take me there

 what can I do
 all I want is to be next to you

 well someone told me yesterday
 that when you throw your love away
 you act as if you just don't care
 you look as if you're going somewhere

 but I just can't convince myself
 I couldn't live with no one else
 and I can only play that part
 and sit and nurse my broken heart

 so lonely

 now no one's knocked upon my door
 for a thousand years or more
 all made up and nowhere to go
 welcome to this one man show

 just take a seat they're always free
 no surprise no mystery
 in this theatre that I call my soul
 I always play the starring role 

 so lonely
 lonely

 lonely, I'm so lonely
 I feel so low
 I feel low
 I feel so 
 Feel so low
 I feel low, low
 I feel low, low, low

 you don't have to put on the red light
 those days are over
 you don't have to sell your body to the night

 Roxanne
 you don't have to wear that dress tonight
 walk the streets for money
 you don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

 Roxanne

 Roxanne
 you don't have to put on the red light
 Roxanne
 put on the red light

 I loved you since I knew you
 I wouldn't talk down to you

 I won't share you with another boy

 I know my mind is made up
 so put away your make up
 told you once I won't tell you again

 cuts me open like a knife
 it leaves me vulnerable
 I have this disease

 I've called you so many times today
 and I guess it's all true what your girlfriend says
 that you don't ever wanna see me again
 and your brother's gonna kill me and he's six feet ten
 I guess you'd call it cowardice
 but I'm not prepared to go on like this

 I can't, I can't
 I can't stand losing
 I can't
 I can't stand losing you

 I see you've sent my letters back
 and my LP records and they're all scratched
 I can't see the point in another day
 when nobody listens to a word I say
 you can call it lack of confidence
 but to carry on living doesn't make no sense

 I can't, I can't
 I can't stand losing

 I guess this is our last goodbye
 and you don't care so I won't cry
 but you'll be sorry when I'm dead
 and all this guilt will be on your head
 I guess you'd call it suicide
 but I'm too full to swallow my pride

 I can't, I can't
 I can't stand losing
 I can't stand losing you

 strange waking dreams before my eyes unfold
 you lay there sleeping like an open doorway
 I stepped outside myself and felt so cold

 take a look at my new toy
 it'll blow your head in two, oh boy

 truth hits everybody
 truth hits everyone

 I thought about it and my dream was broken
 I clutch at images like dying breath
 and I don't wanna make a fuss about it
 the only certain thing in life is death  

 take a look at my new toy
 it'll blow your head in two, oh boy

 truth hits everybody
 truth hits everyone

 where you want to be
 won't you ever see

 my mother cried
 when president Kennedy died
 she said it was the communists
 but I knew better

 would they drop the bomb on us 
 while we made love on the beach
 we were the class they couldn't teach
 'cos we knew better

 we were born
 born in the fifties 
 born
 born in the fifties

 they screamed
 when the Beatles sang
 and they laughed when the King fell down the stars 
 oh they should've known better

 oh we hated our aunts
 then we messed in our pants
 then we lost our faith and prayed to the tv
 oh we should've known better

 we were born
 born in the fifties
 born
 born in the fifties

 we freeze like statues on the pages of history
 living was never like this when we took all those g.c.e.-s
 oh you opened the door for us
 and then you turned to dust

 so don't reprimand us
 we're taking the future
 we don't need no teacher

 won't you be my, be my,
 be my girl

 @{i}Sally (spoken)@{ui}
 I was blue and lonely, I couldn't sleep a wink
 and I could only get unconscious if I'd had to much to drink
 there was somehow, something wrong somewhere
 and each day seemed grey and dead
 the seeds of desperation were growing in my head
 I needed inspiration a brand new start in life
 somewhere to place affection but I didn't want a wife
 and then by lucky chance I saw in a special magazine
 an ad that was unusual the like I'd never seen
 "experience something different with our new imported toy
 she's loving, warm, inflatible and a guarantee of joy"
 she came all wrapped in cardboard all pink and shrivelled down
 a breath of air was all she needed to make her lose that frown
 I took her to the bedroom and pumped her with some life
 and later in a moment that girl became my wife
 and so I sit her in the corner and sometimes stroke her hair
 and when I'm feeling naughty I blow her up with air
 she's cuddly and she's bouncy she's like a rubber ball,
 I bounce her in the kitchen and I bounce her in the hall
 and now my life is different since Sally came my way
 I wake up in the morning and have her on a tray
 she's everything they say she was and I wear a permanent grin
 and I only have to worry in case my girl wears pins

 won't you be my girl
 be my girl

 God bid yesterday goodbye

 bring on the night
 I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

 hangs above my head there in the dark
 can't see for the brightness

 walking back from your house
 walking on the moon
 feet they hardly touch the ground
 walking on the moon
 my feet don't hardly make no sound
 walking on, walking on the moon

 I'm wishing my days away
 no way

 some say
 tomorrow's another day
 you stay
 I may as well play

 @{i}(spoken)@{ui} the other ones are complete bullshit

 you want something corny
 you got it

 there's a house on my street
 and it looks real neat
 I'm the chap who lives in it

 there's a tree on the sidewalk
 there's a car by the door
 I'll go for a drive in it

 and when the wombat comes
 he will find me gone
 he'll look for a place to sit

 my wife has burned the scrambled eggs
 the dog just bit my leg
 my teenage daughter ran away
 my fine young son has turned out gay

 cut off my fingers in the
 door of my car

 how could I do it
 my wife is proud to tell me
 of her love affairs
 how could she do this to me

 my wife has burned the scrambled eggs
 the dog just bit my leg
 my teenage daughter ran away
 my fine young son has turned out gay
 and it would be OK on any other day
 and it would be OK on any other day

 throw down the morning papers
 and spill my tea
 I don't know what's wrong with me

 the cups and plates are in a
 conspiracy
 I'm covered in misery

 my wife has burned the scrambled eggs
 the dog just bit my leg
 my teenage daughter ran away
 my fine young son has turned out gay

 bed's too big without you
 cold wind blows right thru' the open door
 I can't sleep with your memory
 dreaming dreams of what used to be

 when she left I was cold inside
 that look on my face was just pride
 no regrets no love no tears
 living on my own was the least of my fears

 bed's too big without you
 the bed's too big without you
 the bed's too big 
 without you

 since that day when you'd gone
 just had to carry on
 I get thru' day but late at night
 made love to my pillow but it didn't feel right

 every day just the same
 old rules for the same old game
 all I gained was heartache
 all I made was one mistake

 now the bed's too big without you
 the bed's too big without you
 the bed's too big 
 without you

 bed's too big without you
 the bed's too big without you
 the bed's too big without you
 without you
 without you

 I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date
 I'm in a cold sweat, I panic, and it makes me late
 I knew you never asked for this
 I know
 my shots will always misfire
 my shots will always miss

 does everyone stare this way at you
 I only look this way at you

 I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date
 I get the heebie-jeebies, and my panic makes me late
 I break into a cold sweat reaching for the phone
 I let it ring twice before I chicken out and decide you're not at home
 
 does everyone stare the way I do
 I only stare this way at you

 I never noticed the size of my feet
 until I kicked you in the shins
 will you ever forgive me 
 for the shape I'm in
 for the shape I'm in

 does everyone stare the way I do
 I only stare this way at you

 I'm gonna write you a sonnet but I don't know where to start
 I'm so used to laughing at the things in my heart
 last of all I'm sorry 'cos you never asked for this
 I can see I'm not your type and my shot will always miss
 always miss

 no time for the complexities in the conversation
 no time for smiles, no time for knowing
 there's time for the intricacies of explanation
 there's time for getting, even less for showing

 if I could
 I'd slow the whole world down
 I'd bring it to it's knees
 I'd stop it spinning round
 but as it is
 I'm climbing up an endless wall

 no time at all
 no time this time
 no time at all
 no time this time

 no time for a quick kiss at the railway station
 no time for a suitcase, sandwich and a morning paper
 only time for time tables, calls and transportation
 no time to think no time to dare

 if I could
 I'd slow the whole world down
 I'd bring it to it's knees
 I'd stop it spinning round

 young teacher the subject
 of schoolgirl fantasy
 she wants him so badly
 knows what she wants to be
 inside her there's longing
 this girl's an open page
 book marking she's so close now
 this girl is half his age

 don't stand don't stand so
 don't stand so close to me
 don't stand don't stand so
 don't stand so close to me

 her friends are so jealous
 you know how bad girls get
 sometimes it's not so easy
 to be the teacher's pet
 temptation frustration
 so bad it makes him cry
 wet bus stop she's waiting
 his car is warm and dry

 don't stand don't stand so
 don't stand so close to me
 don't stand don't stand so
 don't stand so close to me

 loose talk in the classroom
 to hurt they try and try
 strong words in the staffroom
 the accusations fly
 it's no use he sees her
 he starts to shake and cough
 just like the old man in
 that book by Nabakov

 don't stand don't stand so
 don't stand so close to me
 don't stand don't stand so
 don't stand so close to me

 don't stand don't stand so
 please don't stand so close to me

 how can you say that your not responsible
 what does it have to do with me
 what is my reaction what should it be
 confronted by this latest atrocity

 driven to tears
 driven to tears
 driven to tears

 hide my face in my hands shame wells in my throat
 my comfortable existance is reduced to a shallow meaningless party
 seems that when some innocent die
 all we can offer them is a page in a some magazine
 too many cameras and not enough food
 'cause this is what we've seen

 driven to tears
 driven to tears
 driven to tears

 protest is futile nothing seems to get through
 what's to become of our world who knows what to do

 driven to tears

 turn on my V.C.R.
 same one I've had for years
 James Brown on the Tammy show
 same tape I've had for years
 I sit in my old car
 same one I've had for years
 old battery's running down
 it ran for years and years

 turn on the radio
 the static hurts my ears
 tell me where would I go
 I ain't been out in years
 turn on the stereo
 it's played for years and years
 an Otis Redding song
 it's all I own

 when the world is running down
 you make the best of what's still around
 when the world is running down
 you make the best of what's still around

 plug in my M.C.I
 to excercise my brain
 make records on my own
 can't go out in the rain
 pick up the telephone
 I've listened here for years
 no one to talk to me
 I've listened here for years

 when the world is running down
 you make the best of what's still around
 when the world is running down
 you make the best of what's still around

 when I feel lonely here
 don't waste my time with tears
 I run "Deep Throat" again
 it ran for years and years
 don't like the food I eat
 the cans are running out
 same food for years and years
 I hate the food I eat

 when the world is running down
 you make the best of what's still around

 don't know exactly where I am

 he does the best with me he can

 he claims I suffer from delusions
 yet I'm so confident I'm sane
 it can't be an optical illusion

 though I've tried before to tell her
 of the feelings I have for her in my heart
 every time that I come near her
 I just lose my nerve 
 as I've done from the start

 every little thing she does is magic
 everything she do just turn me on
 even though my life before was tragic
 now I know my love for her goes on 

 do I have to tell the story
 of a thousand rainy days since we first met
 it's a big enough umbrella
 but it's always me that ends up getting wet

 every little thing she does is magic
 everything she do just turn me on
 even though my life before was tragic
 now I know my love for her goes on

 I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
 and ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
 but my silent fears have gripped me
 long before I reach the phone
 long before my tongue has tripped me
 must I always be alone

 every little thing she does is magic
 everything she do just turn me on
 even though my life before was tragic
 now I know my love for her goes on

 one, two, three, four, five, six

 I don't want to spend the rest of my life
 looking at the barrel of an armalite
 I don't want to spend the rest of my days
 keeping out of trouble like the soldiers say
 I don't want to spend the time in hell
 looking at the walls of a prison cell
 I don't ever want to play the part
 of a statistic on a government chart

 there has to be an invisible sun
 it gives its heat to everyone
 there has to be an invisible sun
 that gives us hope when the whole day's done

 it's dark all day and it glows all night
 factory smoke and acetylene light
 I face the day with my head caved in
 looking like something that the cat brought in

 there has to be an invisible sun
 it gives its heat to everyone
 there has to be an invisible sun
 that gives us hope when the whole day's done

 and they're only going to change this place
 by killing everybody in the human race
 they would kill me for a cigarette
 but I don't even wanna die just yet

 there has to be an invisible sun
 it gives its heat to everyone
 there has to be an invisible sun
 that gives us hope when the whole day's done

 one world is enough
 for all of us
 one world is enough
 for all of us

 it's a subject we rarely mention
 but when we do we have this little invention
 by pretending they're a different world from me
 I show my responsibility

 one world is enough
 for all of us
 one world is enough
 for all of us

 the third world breathes our air tomorrow
 we live on the time we borrow
 in our world there's no time for sorrow
 in their world there is no tomorrow

 one world is enough
 for all of us
 one world is enough
 for all of us

 lines are drawn upon the world
 before we get our flags unfurled
 whichever one we pick
 it's just a self deluding trick

 one world is enough
 for all of us
 one world is enough
 for all of us

 I don't want to bring a sour note
 remember this before you vote
 we can all sink or we all float
 'cos we're all in the same big boat

 one world is enough
 for all of us
 one world is enough
 for all of us

 one world is enough
 for all of us
 one world is enough
 for all of us

 one world is enough
 for all of us

 I walk the streets and seek another vision yet
 the echo makes me turn to see that last frontier
 the edge of time closes down as I disappear

 upon a secret journey
 I met a holy man
 his blindness was his wisdom
 I'm such a lonely man

 and as the world was turning
 it rolled itself in pain
 this does not seem to touch you
 he pointed to the rain

 you will see light in the darkness
 you will make some sense of this
 and when you've made your secret journey
 you will find this love you miss

 and on the days that followed
 I listened to his words
 I strained to understand him
 I chased his thoughts like birds

 you will see light in the darkness
 you will make some sense of this
 and when you've made your secret journey
 you will find this love you miss

 I wish I never woke up this morning
 life was easy when it was boring

 I could make a mark if it weren't so dark
 I could be replaced by any bright spark

 to a door
 that's wide open

 grandmother screaming at the wall

 we have to shout above the din of our rice crispies
 we can't hear anything at all
 mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
 but we know all her suicides are fake

 daddy only stares into the distance
 there's only so much more that he can take
 many miles away something crawls from the slime
 at the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

 another industrial ugly morning
 the factory belches filth into the sky
 he walks unhindered through the picket lines today
 he doesn't think to wonder why
 the secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street
 but all he ever thinks to do is watch
 and every single meeting with his so called superior
 is a humiliating kick in the crotch
 many miles away something crawls to the surface
 of a dark Scottish lake

 another working day has ended
 only the rush hour hell to face
 packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
 contestants in a suicidal race
 daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
 he knows that something somewhere has to break
 he sees the family home now looming in the headlights
 the pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
 many miles away there's a shadow on the door
 of a cottage on the shore
 of a dark Scottish lake

 there's a little black spot on the Sun today
 it's the same old thing as yesterday
 there's a black hat caught in a high tree top
 there's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop

 I have stood here before in the pouring rain
 with the world turning circles running 'round my brain
 I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
 but it's my destiny to be the king of pain

 I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign

 there's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
 there's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
 there's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed
 there's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread

 there's a red fox torn by a huntsman's pack

 caught between the Scylla and Charibdes
 hypnotized by you if I should linger
 staring at the ring around your finger
 I have only come here seeking knowledge
 things they would not teach me of in college
 I can see the destiny you sold
 turned into a shining band of gold

 I'll be wrapped around your finger
 I'll be wrapped around your finger

 Mephistopheles is not your name
 but I know what you're up to just the same
 I will listen hard to your tuition
 and you will see it come to its fruition

 I'll be wrapped around your finger
 I'll be wrapped around your finger

 devil and the deep blue sea behind me
 vanish in the air you'll never find me
 I will turn your face to alabaster
 when you'll find your servant is your master

 my sisters and I
 have one wish before we die
 and it may sound strange
 as if our minds are deranged
 please don't ask us why
 beneath the sheltering sky
 we have this strange obsession
 you have the means in your possession

 tea in the Sahara with you
 tea in the Sahara with you

 the young man agreed
 he would satisfy their need
 so they danced for his pleasure
 with a joy you could not measure
 they would wait for him here
 the same place every year
 beneath the sheltering sky
 across the desert he would fly

 tea in the Sahara with you
 tea in the Sahara with you
 tea in the Sahara with you
 tea in the Sahara with you

 the sky turned to black
 would he ever come back
 they would climb a high dune
 they would pray to the Moon
 but he'd never return
 so the sisters would burn
 as their eyes searched the land
 with their cups still full of sand

 tea in the Sahara with you

 once that you've decided on a killing
 first you make a stone of your heart
 and if you find that your hands are still willing
 then you can turn a murder into art

 there really isn't any need for bloodshed
 just do it with a little more finesse
 if you can slip a tablet into someone's coffee
 then it avoids an awful lot of mess

 because it's murder by numbers 123
 it's as easy to learn as your abc
 it's murder by numbers 123
 it's as easy to learn as your abc

 now if you have a taste for this experience
 and you're flushed with your very first success
 then you must try a twosome or a threesome
 and you'll find your conscience bothers you much less

 because murder is like anything you take to
 it's a habit-forming need for more and more
 you can bump off every member of your family
 and anybody else you find a bore

 because it's murder by numbers 123
 it's as easy to learn as your abc
 it's murder by numbers 123
 it's as easy to learn as your abc

 now you can join the ranks of the illustrious
 in history's great dark hall of fame
 all our greatest killers were industrious
 at least the ones that we all know by name

 but you can reach the top of your profession
 if you become the leader of the land
 for murder is the sport of the elected
 and you don't need to lift a finger of your hand

 because it's murder by numbers 123
 it's as easy to learn as your abc
 murder by numbers 123
 it's as easy to learn as your abcde

 I like to eat my friends and make no bones about it
 I like to eat my friends, I couldn't do without it
 ain't a man or poet, friend, I know just how you'll taste
 your limbs go sliding down my throat and never go to waste

 your death, of course, will sadden me, until I grok your essence
 I know your life was not in vain when digestion is commencing
 consider this a celebration and the deepest pact of friends
 and I hope that you will dine on me when I come to an end

 even friends may come to you with a new found revelation
 but think of it as life renewed and not their termination
 "to know you is to eat you" should be the code of lovers
 death brings the highest act of love preserved for one another

 people say that what you are is only what you eat
 and my friends become a part of me oh well it's then that life's complete
 to know you is to eat you, the act of love supreme
 each one of us inside himself can appetise the dream

 when you reach number ten
 and think the struggle ends
 but it ain't the end
 it's only a trend

 you have to unbend
 'cause it's only a trend
 don't lose all your friends
 don't make your heroes end

 when you reach number eight it ain't no pearly gate
 'cause it won't satiate your growing appetite
 you can ply your trade and push your crusade
 emancipate or indoctrinate, but the
 traps are all laid for any honest crusade
 your old values will fade as you struggle to make the grade
 as you struggle to make the grade
 as you struggle to make the grade
 you neededn't bother

 when you hit number four you're almost through the door
 but there's a whole lot more you just can't ignore
 the telephone's sure, you know the score
 but don't let this uproar dissipate your encore
 it's written in the news how you paid your dues
 but you've no excuse for the people you abuse

 when you reach number one you can beat your drum
 you can sack your roadies in Birmingham
 when your record is platinum you can stick it to the bath
 to the wall like you've always planned
 it's written in the news how you paid your dues

 fatal fascination for the seedy part of town
 walk down the street and your head spins round
 don't be seen alone without your friends at night
 take a gun or a knife to the low life

 don't have to be born into this society
 pay for love but the hate comes free
 bring enough money for the rest of your life
 don't bring your wife to the low life

 bringing us there to the degredation
 always keep your back to the wall
 no rewards for your infatuation
 low life
 no life at all
 yeah low life low life

 in here to long to be afraid anymore
 you can't reach the bed so you sleep on the floor
 you get so stoned you think you could fly
 but you won't get high on the low life

 low life

 though it's me that's on fire not this cigarette
 I was stabbed in the back by that young suffragette
 and what do I care if she leaves me alone
 if I need somebody I'll pick up the phone
 I'll put on my good face, clean up the flat
 I'm starting all over good bye to all that
 put on some music and pour out a drink
 I'll go back to bed and I'll try not to think

 someone to talk to
 someone to talk to
 someone to talk to
 someone to talk to
 someone to talk to

 she was a person I just couldn't see
 and I tried to make her what she couldn't be
 we tried and we tried, but of course in the end
 I drove her crazy and right 'round the bend
 now it's too much to just sit here and cry
 I can't be seen with a tear in my eye
 why am I standing right next to the phone
 when I kept on saying I must be alone

 someone to talk to
 someone to talk to
 someone to talk to
 someone to talk to
 someone to talk to

 I love you, why didn't I say that before
 I guess that it's safe now she's walked through the door
 it's hard when you know that you've got to go on
 feeling so weak and pretending you're strong
 I didn't see her I only felt me
 and one day I'll learn just which part of me bleeds
 now that she's gone I know she was great
 but I fucked it up and now it's too late

 now that I have found you
 in the coolth of your evening smile
 the shade of your parasol
 and your love flows through me
 though I drink at your pool

 I burn for you
 I burn for

 you and I are lovers
 and nighttime falls around our bed
 in peace we sleep entwined
 and your love flows through me
 though an ocean soothes my head

 I burn for you
 I burn for you

 stars will fall from dark skies
 as ancient rocks are turning
 quiet fills the room
 and your love flows through me
 though I lie here so still

 I burn for you
 I burn for you

 once upon a daydream
 I fell in love with you
 once upon a moonbeam
 I gave that love to you
 once upon a lifetime
 I knew it must be true
 when the months had turned us
 I'd have to marry you

 once upon a daydream
 doesn't happen anymore
 once upon a moonbeam
 this is no place for tenderness

 once her daddy found out
 he threw her to the floor
 he killed her unborn baby
 and kicked me from the door
 once upon a nightmare
 I bought myself a gun
 I blew her daddy's brains out
 now hell has just begun

 once upon a daydream
 doesn't happen anymore
 once upon a moonbeam
 this is no place for sentiment

 once upon a lifetime
 a lifetime filled with tears
 the boy would pay for his crime
 with all his natural years
 once upon a daydream
 he'd make you his someday
 once upon a moonbeam
 he'd dream his life away

 once upon a daydream
 doesn't happen anymore
 once upon a moonbeam
 this is no place for miracles

 once upon a daydream
 once upon a daydream
 once upon a daydream
 once upon a day...

 young teacher the subject
 of schoolgirl fantasy
 she wants him so badly
 knows what she wants to be
 inside her there's longing
 this girl's an open page
 book marking she's so close now
 this girl is half his age

 don't stand so close to me
 don't stand so
 don't stand so close to me
 don't stand so close to me

 her friends are so jealous
 you know how bad girls get
 sometimes it's not so easy
 to be the teacher's pet
 temptation frustration
 so bad it makes him cry
 wet bus stop she's waiting
 his car is warm and dry

 don't stand don't stand so
 don't stand so close to me
 don't stand don't stand so
 don't stand so close to me

 don't stand don't stand so
 please don't stand so close to me
 don't stand don't stand so
 please don't stand so close to me

 loose talk in the classroom
 to hurt they try and try
 strong words in the staffroom
 the accusations fly
 it's no use he sees her
 he starts to shake he start to cough
 just like the old man
 in that famous book by Nabakov

 don't stand don't stand so
 please don't stand so close to me

 all those stories that used to say
 there's a new world begins today
 bad old days just a memory
 trouble is that it seems to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
 it's the same old planet
 golden dreams of a golden age
 silver tongue of an ancient sage
 when the prose is half fulfilled
 seems it's time for you to pay all the bills, no, no no
 not on the planet

 I had a vision the other night
 woken up by an angel of light
 she sang a song so pure and bright
 a simple tale of how it might have been
 my political friend tells me I've got to fight
 he says I've got to stand up for my rights
 well that's all right my friend you know I will
 just one thing you know, I ain't gonna kill, no, no no
 not on the planet

 go take me flying out of this place 
 to another time and some other space 
 I'm just another soldier fallen from grace 
 won't you see me with a smile on my face? 
 no,no,no! 
 not on the planet 

 (not on the planet) 
 it's a new world 
 (not on the planet) 
 it's the same old planet 
 (not on the planet) 
 it's a new world 
 (not on the planet)

 everyone I know is lonely
 my God's so far away
 and my heart belongs to no one
 so now sometimes I pray
 please take this space between us
 and fill it up some way
 I've been waiting for my brother
 since fucking Christmas day

 there's a song that everyone's heard
 let me hear it, make me a part
 songs everyone's heard
 let me hear it, make me a part

 nothing seems to matter 
 nor it keeps me anymore
 you say my world is shattered
 I just did it on the floor
 it won't go no further
 it is here I make my stand
 if you say my life is precious
 when you held it in your hand

 there's a song that everyone's heard
 let me hear it, make me a part
 songs everyone's heard
 let me hear it, make me a part

 just the kind of lady to really set you sailing
 on emotion's ocean
 just like a river she's rolling on forever
 got you running around now you've found
 she turns the tide of your tired heart
 back to the place where you made a start
 she's got the power to burn you up
 but she's turning, turning your golden heart

 lady, lady of delight
 lady, lady of the night

 don't stand in the gutter boy, mumble and mutter
 that the world ain't treating you right
 I'm talking to you and I can prove it to you
 you'd better listen to me I've got a guarantee
 now who told you life was meant to be
 happiness, Light, Love and Free
 what made you think you had a right?
 you're just a frightened child in the middle of the night

 lady, lady of delight
 lady, lady of the night

 wild dogs baying at the moon
 alley cats swinging out of tune
 hoot of owls across the lake
 these are sounds that follow her wake

 don't think you can change her
 I know she'll rearrange you
 you might disagree but just you wait and see
 you think you're winning but look at the state you're in
 danger, stranger
 some call her goddess some call her a whore
 but she's a sister, a lover, a mother and more
 she keeps on coming, she makes it clear
 that if you let her in you've got nothing to fear

 lady, lady of delight
 lady, lady of the night

 and you see my love, starting to see love
 how can you be my love

 you've got me floating, you've got me floating along
 you've got me hoping, really got me towing a line
 you've got me hopping, really got me singing a song
 you've got me hopping, got me bopping
 I won't be stopping till you go
 humming like a dynamo
 baby you're a dynamo
 see it on the video
 everything you want to know
 well you don't need to fear no leader
 you don't need it now

 because we're all part - a fantastic heart
 of a great big you somehow
 when you've got love the stars
 above all shine for you right now

 happy to be

 towers tumbled, all the buildings crumbled
 volcanoes rumbled
 insurance salesman mumbled
 ballerians bumbled, all the heroes stumbled
 politicians fumbled
 suddenly a hand held out, like a ticket tout
 it was a chart, it was a card
 and these are your instructions
 and what he offered in his hand
 it was a diagram, a master plan
 a secret plan for your deduction

 crystals shatter, all the singers chatter
 while the drums just clatter
 your silken raiment's tatter
 while the poets natter "oh, it doesn't matter"
 please ignore the latter
 settle back you're growing fatter
 oh you know they know conception
 well, you're far out in space
 I see you trying to trace a design
 of your heart on the stars

 on the open ocean, like an open book
 see the feeble fumble for a better look
 see the sheep shake
 and the sleep wake
 not an earthquake
 or a death wake
 and all the while - through the testing and the trials
 she smiles
 eternity smiles...
