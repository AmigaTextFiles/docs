The third planet from the Sun.<BR>70% of the Earth's surface (including the north and south polar icecaps) is covered with water.<P>The Earth is surrounded by a
life-supporting atmosphere and is the only planet on which life is known to
exist. This atmosphere also acts as a barrier, keeping out harmful radiation from the Sun.
This layer is however, being destroyed by toxic emissions from industrial
manufacture and energy production<P>The Earth is almost spherical, flattened slightly
at the poles, and is composed of three concentric layers: the core, the
mantle, and the crust. The crust and the topmost layer of the mantle form about 12 major moving plates, some of which carry the continents. The plates are in constant motion, called tectonic drift. When these plates rub together they cause EarthQuakes.
