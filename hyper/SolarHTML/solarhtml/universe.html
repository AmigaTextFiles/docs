The term `Universe` describes all of space and its contents, the study of which is called cosmology.<P>
The universe is thought to be about 13.5 billion years old, and is mostly empty space, dotted with galaxies as far as telescopes can see.<P>The most distant detected galaxies lie about 10 billion light years from Earth, and are moving farther apart as the universe expands.<P>Several theories attempt to explain how the universe came into being and
evolved, for example, the Big Bang theory of an expanding universe
originating in a single explosive event.<P>
Apart from those galaxies within the Local Group, all the galaxies we see are moving away
from us.<BR>The farther we look into space, the faster distant galaxies are receding. This observation led to the theory of an expanding universe, first proposed by Edwin Hubble in 1929, and to Hubble's law, which states that the speed with which one galaxy moves away from another is proportional to its distance from it.<P>The most current data indicates that for every <A HREF="key.html">MegaParsec</A> the galaxies move apart, their speed increases by 70 Kilometres Per Second.
