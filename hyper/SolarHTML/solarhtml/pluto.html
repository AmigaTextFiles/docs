<P>
Pluto is the smallest and, usually, outermost planet of the solar
system.<P>The existence of Pluto was predicted by calculation by Percival
Lowell and the planet was located by Clyde Tombaugh 1930.<P>Pluto's highly elliptical orbit occasionally takes it within the orbit of Neptune, such as 1979-99. It is of low density, composed of rock and ice, with frozen methane on its surface and a thin atmosphere. Charon, Pluto's moon, was discovered 1978. It is about 1,000 km in
diameter and orbits the planet at a height of about 20,000 km every 6.39 days - the same time that Pluto takes to spin on its axis.  Some astronomers have suggested that Pluto was a former moon of Neptune that escaped. Charon remains permanently above the same place on Pluto.<P>Pluto has recently retaken its posision as furthest planet from the Sun, (a position it swaps occasionaly with Neptune, as their orbits overlap).</P>
