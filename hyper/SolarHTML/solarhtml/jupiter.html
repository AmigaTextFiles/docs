The fifth planet from the Sun, and the largest in the solar system.<P>
Jupiter is largely composed of hydrogen and helium, liquefied by pressure in its interior, and probably with a rocky core larger than the Earth.<P>Its main feature is the Great Red
Spot, a cloud of rising gases, revolving anticlockwise, 14,000 km wide and some 30,000 km long.<P>
Its visible surface consists of clouds of white ammonia crystals, drawn out
into belts by the planet's high speed of rotation. Darker orange and brown clouds at
lower levels may contain sulphur, as well as simple organic compounds.<BR>
Further down still, temperatures are warm, a result of heat left over from
Jupiter's formation, and it is this heat that drives the turbulent weather
patterns of the planet. The Great Red Spot was first observed 1664. Its
top is higher than the surrounding clouds; its colour is thought to be due
to red phosphorus.  Its strong magnetic field gives rise to a large
surrounding magnetic `shell', or magnetosphere, from which bursts of radio
waves are detected.<P>The Southern Equatorial Belt in which the Great Red
Spot occurs is subject to unexplained fluctuation. In 1989 it sustained a
dramatic and sudden fading. The four largest moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede,
and Callisto, are the Galilean satellites, discovered in 1610 by Galileo
(Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system).  Three small moons were
discovered in 1979 by the Voyager space probes, as was a faint ring of dust
around Jupiter's equator, 55,000 km above the cloud tops.
