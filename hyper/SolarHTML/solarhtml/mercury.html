Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.<BR>In 1974 the US space probe Mariner 10
discovered that its surface is cratered by meteorite impacts.<P>
Its largest known feature is the Caloris Basin, 1,400 km,
There are also cliffs hundreds of kilometres long and up to 4 km high, thought to have been formed by the cooling of the planet billions of years ago.<BR>Inside is an iron core three-quarters of the planet's diameter, which produces a magnetic field 1% the strength of the Earth's.<P>Being the closest planet to the sun, Mercury has to endure extremely high temperatures and any atmosphere there may have been, would have been burnt off long ago.
