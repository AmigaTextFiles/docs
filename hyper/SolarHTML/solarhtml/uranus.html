<P>
The seventh planet from the Sun.<P>Uranus was discovered by William Herschel 1781. It is
twice as far out as the sixth planet, Saturn.The spin axis of Uranus is tilted at 98 degrees, so that one pole points towards the Sun, giving extreme seasons.<P>Uranus spins
from east to west, the opposite of the other planets, with the exception of
Venus and possibly Pluto.<P>
Data derived from the space probe Voyager 1 in 1986 revealed that Uranus is
covered with a cloud layer under which an ocean of superheated water
exists. The pressure caused by the thick atmosphere keeps the water from
boiling away and the heat keeps the pressure from solidifying the water.<P>
Voyager 2 detected ten rings, composed of rock pieces and large ice
boulders, around the planet's equator, and found ten small moons in
addition to the five visible from Earth. Titania, the largest moon, has a
diameter of 1,610 km. The rings are charcoal black, and may be debris of former `moonlets' that have broken up.
<P>
Uranus is classed as a Gas Giant, although it is much smaller than Saturn & Jupiter.<BR><BR>
Uranus, for reasons unknown, is tilted by 98°, so it is virtually orbiting on its side.
