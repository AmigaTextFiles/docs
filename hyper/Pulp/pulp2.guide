@NODE LION "Lion Software: The software goes from strength to strength "
 Lion Software is made up of:

    Simon P. Osborne        PULP fan extraordinaire

    Duncan Strand           Sort of PULP fan

 This guide file was brought to you entirely by Simon as Dunc is busy on our
 next release, an Amiga RPG called The Tome Of Destiny. It might actually be
 quite good. Our previous work was The Chronicles Of Aarbron, released both on
 the PC and on the Amiga (the Amiga version was better) to critical acclaim. Or
 so we like to think. We hope to keep going on until we come up with a marketable
 idea, at which point we will seek both financial backing and experienced
 programmers, particularly for graphics as we are both rubbish at both drawing
 and graphics manipulation in C, which is our language of choice. (Does anyone
 use anything else these days?)

 We'd also like to point out that the lyrics in this file are ©1983-1999 by
 PULP, and so we are making _NO_ money out of this. If you'd like to give money
 to somebody, send it to Jarvis Cocker as he is the originator of all this
 stuff.

 Piracy is illegal, as is plagarism. We take NO credit for any of the lyrics
 presented herein, merely for their presentation in this format. We hope this
 will interest you more in the greatest band in the known and unknown universe,
 Pulp, as they deserve far more respect than they get.

 Here's where YOU come in. I may have accidentally mis-typed certain words or
 even (God forbid) mis-heard some of the lyrics. If you disagree with me about
 some of the lyrics presented herein, please get in touch with me and tell me
 what you think I have got wrong. I will re-appraise the song in light of your
 message and perhaps change the file if I agree with you. Hey - O'll even mention
 you in this bit as a contributor. Can't say fairer than that, and that's
 cutting me own throat. Any other comments / ideas would also be appreciated.

@NODE JARVIS "Pulp: Jarvis Cocker 1979 - now"
 Jarvis Cocker:


 Self-conscious lad of sixteen who started a band whilst still at school - Arabacus
 Pulp - and proceeded to become one of the foremost stars of the nineties,
 fifteen years later. In 1979 Arabacus Pulp - later Pulp - came into being due to
 Jarvis' will: "I used to walk round school pretending I was in a band," he says.

 He has been the main lyricist since the group's beginning and his vocal and
 lyrical range has increased to a much more sophisticated sounding pop star to
 that of a young man in the throws of teenage angst, which he was, by his own admission,
 on It, Pulp's first recording.

 Having been brought up on the Space-Age dream of the 70s, he found the
 eighties to be a dark and depressing place, full of dole queues and misery.
 After all the silliness and 'glam' of the 70s, he said it was as if in the eighties
 everyone was told to behave more sensibly. But he still believed that in his
 lifetime, he would be living in space. His lyrics at this time bespeak of misery
 and hopelessness, invoking feelings of loneliness, claustrophobia and despair.
 When asked about a contemporary group, The Smiths, who were covering much the
 same ground but to a wider audience, Jarvis is quoted as saying that "Morrissey
 cannot sing," which emphasizes how low he was at this point. The darkness is
 evident in such songs as "Being Followed Home" and "Tunnel", and their second
 album, Freaks, is unnerving listening at times.

 Despair or no, he still found time to fall out of a window trying to impress a
 woman and had to be in a wheelchair for six months after sustaining a fractured
 pelvis. He was told that he was lucky to walk again. Despite this unhappy event,
 he made the most of it by using the wheelchair as a stage prop, weeks after he
 no longer needed it!

 In 1988 he decided to go to college and studied a degree in Film at St Martins
 College of Art in London. He thought initially that Pulp would go their separate
 ways. He had been in a band for almost a decade and had spent most of his time on
 the dole and living in tower blocks. However, much the reverse happened, and a
 new member, Steve McKay joined the group, and got Jarvis into E and raves.

 Whilst studying for his degree, some of his best lyrics so far were written, and
 Pulp took the distinctly cheesy, glam, 70s route to stardom. However, they were
 having trouble with their record company, Fire Records, who did not release
 their album Separations for another two years. Finally it was released in 1992
 due to pressure from the group who were working with another record company -
 Island Records. They had released three singles on Sheffield's Gift Records
 the A-sides and Bonus tracks of which were brought together on PulpIntro in 1993
 on Island. From there, they never looked back.

 Jarvis' lyrical and sartorial style went to new highs, and their next effort,
 His N Hers was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize of 1994, coming Second.
 Their next effort, Different Class was phenominally successful, and, this time,
 they won the Mercury Music Prize. Jarvis became a well-known star, earthy,
 Northern, witty, dubbed by one comedian "the weed in tweed" for his sartorial
 taste.

 Then, when it seemed Pulp couldn't get any bigger, Jarvis stood up for decency
 and Britishness against American self-righteousness by interrupting Michael
 Jackson's "Jesus" impersonation on stage with silly hand movements and bottom
 waggling. It was just the needed antidote against Jackson's self-aggrandising
 "saviour of the world" attempt to clear his name. While many papers branded
 Cocker's actions as juvenile and a publicity stunt, no-one can argue that his
 mockery of Michael Jackson is a thoroughly English sentiment of justice and
 realism. Besides which, Jarvis has never molested any young children. And he
 writes his own songs.

 In 1996, after 12 years with Pulp, Russel decided to leave, and the band was
 forced to reconsider their stance. They came back with This Is Hardcore in
 1998, which arguably contains some of their best material to date. Jarvis'
 lyrical ability seems to go from strength to strength. But, as Steve McKay
 said about him:

    "My friend Steve and I always used to say that Jarvis would
    be a complete star, or he'd be a waster, sweeping the streets
    for the next twenty years. Everyone knew that in Sheffield.
    It was a fact."

    many less-well-known album tracks and B-sides. Remixes are not included.

When I was with this girl last night
She held me tight and turned me on.
The moon was dark and those clothes so tight,
Her purfume strong it turned me on.

Fleeting moments touched in the night
Then so strongly banished by the light.
The present's gone, memories remain
Of how she kissed and turned me on.

Now there's this love inside of me;
I've got this love -
Inside of me.

An unskilled hand, dull aching pain
Designed to reach and touch you once again.
Distractions cannot sate the need,
It grows once more, it grows once more.

I've got this love inside of me;
I've got this love -
Inside of me.

I've got this love inside of me;
I've got this love -
Inside of me.

I have this faith inside of me,
Why can't you see, why can't you see?
I'm stranded here, with no way home
Please rescue me, why won't you rescue me?

I've got this love inside of me;
I've got this love -
Inside of me.

So you could have the chance to see
The beauty of this situation that -
That you can share with me.

It's not strange to me (hay-hay-hay-hay)
All alone, you and I in our high tower,
That's the way to be (hee-hee-hee).

Some laugh at my lighthouse, they say
That it's just an ivory tower.
But I don't mind because I know
Their envy grows by the hour.
See I have a purpose up here
To guide the ships upon their way.
All this is mine, it could be your too,
What do you say?

Looking at my present situation
The act cannot last for long.
Viewed from outside,
These pursuits I've not tried
Seem possessed of a certain allure.
Now they're no longer a source of mystery,
Myv faith in them's more unsure.

Now the time to play is over,
Time to dispose of the lies.
Time to show what's really on my mi-hi-hi-hi-hi-nd.
Yes, I'd like to turn you over,
To see what's on your other side.
To see if the problem's in my mi-hi-hi-hi-hi-nd.

Choice is quite clear:
To move on or stay here;
Decision is harder to take.
Reject what I have for something unstable
Could easily be a mistake.
So I walk round the place
With a smile on my face
Pretending the best that I can.
Hoping to lose the inclination
To desire what I can't understand.

Skin fall in flakes from each one.
Like leaves from autumn trees
They float upon the breeze.

Are slowly decaying and
Drying out in the sun
There for your eyes.
One stares in your face
They seem to accuse you. (Ahh-Ahh)

To earn this surprise?

Flesh underneath
Can be pink.
Quite a strange affair

They gasp and moan for air.
Each fish on your lawn chair.

A pile of blue that is
Soon swept away-hay-hay-hay.

Or is it for real?

And while my mum did cook the meal
She was under the table with me.

To feed the ducks some bread,
But the fowls wouldn't touch a scrap,
So we jumped in the duckpond instead!

Crouched down by a bush at the roadside,

Lost down by the side of the river
And no light comes from the empty sky.

Tonight, make it tonight.
Tonight, make it tonight.

I left home at midnight,
Made for the horizon,
No sense of direction,
I walked on for miles.
Oh I hope that I find you.

I hide from the headlamps,
No light in the windows,
The whole town is sleeping
And somewhere you lie
Oh I wish I could find you.

I'm lost by the river,
My clothes are in tatters,
My face scarred by branches,
I shiver with cold
No I don't think I'll find you.

Walking from the scene of some humiliation, feeling like a dog.
Walking from the scene of some romantic triumph, feeling like God.

Walk towards the small town lights
Felt brighter than the lot of them.
Can have anything, can never fail.
The Will To Power, the force of destiny and efficiency.

Generations glimpse the high pitch, play it for real.
Four billion spectators look on; judging, analysing, losing;

Sinking, swimming, striving, longing, failing.
Weak flesh, projected through Europe
On speed of all the needs
Suck and sate, forces of fate.

A polemic, a sharp cutter, a fashion, a spirit, a simplicity.

The only choice, the only voice,
In the darkness.
The only choice, the only voice.

1933 where are you now?
Where are the broken bottles?
Where's the toffs slumming it?
Where's the fanaticism?
Where's truth and beauty?

Your look is no happier than mine.
Damnation is waiting in the mirror
But you shouldn't mind.
Their legs start a feeling in your stomach,
Their eyes knock you backwards with a glance.
Your pride sinks unnoticed in the river,
Given half a chance.

And your past is just a bedroom full of implements of cruelty
And a list will bind your eyes as you grow old.
But you want to join the laughter sharing, simple shreds of feeling,
But you fidget and your heart is growing cold.

Smiles left unfollowed start to haunt you.
Chances that perished long ago.
The Devil is waiting in the bathroom
With your worthless soul.
The years pull their weight down on your cheekbones.
The nights out are hanging from your waist.
The years float like dust down in the sunlight
With an aftertaste.

And your past is just a bedroom full of implements of cruelty
And a list will bind your eyes as you grow old.
But you want to join the laughter sharing, simple shreds of feeling,
But you fidget and your heart is growing cold.

La la la la la la la la

And just one kiss could set them straight.
97 lovers, twisted out of shape.
And just one kiss could set them straight.

I know a woman,
With a picture of Roger Moore
In a short towelling dressing gown
Pinned to her bedroom wall.
She married a man
Who works on a building site.
Now they make love beneath Roger
Every Friday night.

Oh, 97 lovers, twisted out of shape.
And just one kiss could set them straight.
97 lovers, rose to meet the sun.
And when the day was over, there were only 91.

Another I know, well
She laughs too loud with her friends.
Playing it safe on the surface,
To give her heart time to mend.
And then one day without warning
He walks unannounced through the door,
And he picks her heart up off the table,
And he watches it smash on the floor.

97 lovers, twisted out of shape.
And just one kiss could set them straight.

@{u}Aborigine (1986)@{uu}
Starts so slowly, just a place to stay.
Somewhere warm where they can spend their days.
Air is stagnant and he feels unclean.
Hair hangs greasy and he smells obscene.
Something's happened and its not so good.
Broken bottles in the face of love.
Mottled flesh under the harsh strip light;
Nylon sheets to keep them warm at night.
Once it's started it can never stop,
Fills his head with a dark, damp fog.
In the distance is a constant cry,
Growing louder as the years go by.
Days get longer and he starts to drink.
Spews his stomach in the kitchen sink.
Tells his children they should have respect,
Tells his wife that she's a nervous wreck.
Hates his wife and he hates them all.
He hates his wife and he hates them all.

Can't be bothered when it's all the same,
Leave it long enough it goes away.
In the meantime, stomach turns to fat.
She tries to tell him but he can't have that.
She's only jealous and she's telling lies,
Standing naked in his flesh disguise.
It took him years to get her into bed.
Now he's got her he just wants her dead.
She wants excitement and she needs romance,
All she gets are dirty underpants.
Stupid animal that can't know why,
Something's wrong so someone has to die.
The wind is blowing and the rain falls down,
Sends his family on a trip downtown.
Sees them die in a burning wreck.
Sees them burn, smokes a cigarette.
Hates his wife and he hates them all.
He hates his wife and he hates them all.

He knows he's finished but he can't stop now
And he wants to end it but he can't see how
And its all in pieces, thrown it all away.
Oh, but he's not ugly he just looks that way.
And he wants some quiet and he needs it now
But the scream he started's getting far too loud.
He still pretends he does it just for now;
His day will come he'll lose it all somehow.
Killing time until his ship arrives;
Been dead ten years but he's still alive.
And time is wasted and the ship has sunk
But he hasn't noticed and comes home drunk.
He's just dead weight, he'll never leave the ground,
He tries to stand but he keeps falling down.
It's hard to know he doesn't count for much.
He's not a has-been; just a never-was.
He hates his wife and he hates them all.
He hates his wife and he hates them all.
Hates his wife...
...And he hates them all.

@NODE GOODNIGHT "Goodnight - Cocker, Mansell, Doyle, Doyle, Senior "
@{u}Goodnight (1986)@{uu}
(spoken) Now it's coming to the end of the evening.
The time when the ceiling sways and objects jerk out of place.
Your eyelids heavy, you make your way down the yellow streets
past rows and rows of houses; curtains drawn tight against
the cold night air. To a flight of stairs which lead to a
room where a bed is waiting for you to lie down - perhaps
alone, perhaps not - and go to sleep again.

They wait alone,
In unused rooms they sit,
And remember.
Oh, please remember.

(spoken) So you lie on your back in the dark and hear the blood
rushing in your ears and the soft "tick, tick, tick" of your
watch against the matress springs. Patterns merge behind your
eyes, purple and green glowing gently and all is soft in furry
darkness. You yawn once, turn on your side and fall to sleep
again.

They wait alone.
They bathed your eyes when night were cold.
Remember.
Oh please remember

(spoken) there's something you've forgotten. When you awoke
later that night the bedroom was cold, and you were alone,
alone and afraid of the dark.

Watching.
Waiting.
As you lie on your back,
Naked between the cold sheets,
Not dead just sleeping
Sleeping;
You will never wake again.
Ha ha ha ha.

His body loved her,
His mind was set on other things.
Keep your face out of sight
And your thought to yourself.
And this went on for several nights,
Festering in silence,
Growing in the dark

And this they saw as love,
Love.
So sad to see,
They suffocate at night.
And this they saw as love,
Love.
So sad to see,
To see it slowly die.

She met his wishes,
He found that he had changed his mind.
Now the fit is too tight,
And the bedroom too warm.
The days are filled with things to do.
Night-time lies so hollow
And memories betray

Memories of love,
Love.
So sad to see,
They suffocate at night.
And this they saw as love,
Love.
So sad to see,
To see it slowly die.

Two years have passed,
Two years of emptiness inside.
And the grey skies above,
Show how far I went wrong.
I wonder if she's living there,
The way that I recall,
The way I always think of you.
And when I think of you,

I think of love,
Love.
So sad to see,
They suffocate at night.
And this they saw as love,
Love.
So sad to see,
To see it slowly die.

I wrote you a letter,
I threw it away.
I wrote you a letter,
Ithrew it away.

I need her,
Oh, I know I don't need her.

@{u}Tunnel (1985)@{uu}
(spoken throughout)
The tenth of July 1985...
Don't ask stupid questions...
I had nothing else...
I had nothing else to do, I was bored...
I had, I had not...

Fifteen weeks since the light has gone,
Fifteen weeks with the same shirt on.
A thousand bodies stink and sweat,
And somebody's trying to roll a cigarette

Clean mister.
Clean mister.
Clean mister.
Clean mister.

I had the same shirt on for weeks...

Action...

Hey mister,
(Fifteen weeks with the same shirt on)

Hey mister.
Hey mister.
Hey mister.
Hey mister.

Just relax and enjoy it, it's nothing really.
Let's get you out of those wet clothes,
come on, just lift yourself up, get those
dreadful trousers off. You'll feel so much
better afterwards. Just close your eyes and
let it ooze all over you. Trickling down
your back all warm and sticky. Isn't that nice?
No, don't speak, just let yourself go, sink,
sinking down, deeper and deeper and deeper.

At three o'clock that morning I awoke in an unfamiliar room...
In my hands like sodden paper...
Out with a thick, glutinous, pale green liquid...
Sunlight through net curtains...

Going six hundred miles an hour into brilliant white light.
There's a brass band playing somewhere.
Roll over onto your back and wait for the talcum.
But what's that smell? Pull back the light crisp linen sheets to
find the shirt they peeled off your back only two hours before
the bedroom tips sideways.

No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

Let me go!
The pain; let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!

Why did I grow up with this feeling?...
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ahhh!...
Shut up!...
Stop!...
Stop!...
It's me!...
I've got to get out of this stinking shit hole!...
I know I'd be clean! As you were...
And to...all this crap all around me!...
I know!...

... And to wake one day in green fields with the sky blue
above me. And to be clean again. I know I'll never ever
be clean again. Never be clean again.

Beacause you dared to doubt his word

Won't you come with me to the fairground?
Your head will be spinning,
I said, your head is your feet.
And the man at the side of me starts a lewd laugh,
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
At the cat with two heads and the dog with eight legs.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

I sought shelter from the storm
In a small inn by the coast.
In the children's room three identical sisters sat
Except for the one that was hideously deformed,
Her grotesque features seemed to parody her sister's beauty.
Ridiculing and mocking everything I held dear.

Still as wax.

Ridiculing and parodying everything we held dear.
Making a mockery of our former emotions.
Dragging it all down to his level.

Come on, spin those carts, boys,
It makes the girls scream.

I don't know what for
I don't know by whom.
The smell of your dress
A face in the rain
The pavement shines wet
In focus again.
Ohhhh. Ohhhh. Ohhhh. Ohhh-oh-oh.

In a dead seaside town I try to change my mind
For a well-balanced view that was not mine to find.
Heaven knows all your
Scars are on show, they last a lifetime.
And your hands leave their
Marks on the sand they last forever.
Forever.

It's clear to me you fit so perfectly
In a dimly-lit room just in sight of the sea.
His twisted face tells me to leave this place
You know, somewhere,
But I shouldn't go there, I shouldn't go there.
Heaven knows all your
Scars are on show, they last a lifetime.
And your hands leave their
Marks on the sand they last forever.

They've followed me home -
The one with the dog breath
In the tattoo bar
Says something in a language
That I don't understand.
The street stinks of piss and dead fish.
Hit the garden wall
Barefoot on the slimy grass.
Air blowing in my lungs,
Hear him swear as he
Stumbles and falls behind me.
Down in the cobbled street,
Footsteps bouncing off the walls.
Which way?
The bottle smashes,
The glint of the blade in the moonlight,
Someone laughs.
The corner's turned,
And it's too late.
The first blow falls;
And nothing.

I woke on the beach sometime later
To a grey and sunless sky.
Your voice still slithers in my head.
I can't remember what she said.
I get to my feet, my body aches.
I make for the town, for no-one's sake.
My mind is a blur, I feel so weak,
I see your reflection in the street.
It's what you deserve, it's what you need,
Just like those stupid books you read.
I look to the sky, I see your face,
Collapse in the road, I hear you say:
"I shouldn't go there, I shouldn't go there."

My wound's healing now and your imprint fades.
Now just a pale scar for five vanished days.
Your voice is so weak, your face is unclear,
Your body a legend from a forgotten year.
I'm being followed home.
I'm being followed home.
I'm being followed home.

Then again she might make you
Everything that you want her to,
And if you could walk away
Where would you go, anyway?
And if you've still got the chance
I know you know:
You'll stay-ay-ay
Stay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Oh, you'll stay-ay-ay-ay.

Oh. Ohh.
Oh oh-oh-oh.
Woah oh-oh-oh-oahhh.
Oh-oh-oh.
Oh.
Give me a city.
Give me the sea.
Give to me everything I need.
The future is shining
Like a giant metal beast.
It shine so bright tonight,
With it's legs open wide,

And love is blind
Falls in love with itself again.
Like it never should.
The way it always can.
Oh, and she is mine
But the world is much bigger now,
Oh, tell me, should I hold her hand
And give her love
Or take her home
And let it slide away?

Oh, now is the time,
Jump into it all,
I'll just hold my nose
And try not to fall,
To seek and to find.
Instead of walking around
With eyes glued to the sky,
I'll turn them down to the ground.
Oh, and I used to think
That maybe one day
I'd find the love of my life.
Oh, but it's so far away.
Oh, I dunno why. Oh, but I,
I want it all tonight.

And love is blind
Falls in love with itself again.
Like it never should.
The way it always can.
Oh, and she is mine
But the world is so much bigger now,
Oh, tell me, should I hold her hand
And give her love
Or take her home
And let it slide away?

(spoken) Oh, We held hands
And we looked out of the bedroom window.
We could see all the buildings collapsing around us,
So we kissed
And we lay on the bed
And waited for the ceiling to fall in.
But it never did.
In the morning it was all still there,
The spilt milk and the dog turds.
In that grey ash-tray morning light,
I could hear thousands of people,
And they were all singing this song.

Na na-na na.
Na nah-na na.
Na nah-na na.
Na na-na-na na.
La la-la-la la.

Hey butcher,
Oh, hey butcher, what's your name?
Oh, hey butcher what's your game?
Oh, you take all their love
And you suck out their eyes,
And then you rip out their hearts
And you eat their insides.
Yeah then you just walk away
With a smile on your face.
Hey, butcher, hey butcher,
I've seen your face before.

And nahhh
Na-na-na-na-na-na-nah.
Oh, na-na-na na-na-na-nah.

I've never seen you
Look so ugly
As the way you did that night.
That night was eighteen months ago.

Now I'm two hours from the station.
Yeah, I'm coming home again.
I'm gonna show this town who's master,
Soon as I get off this train.
You're gonna love me more than ever,
And the sun will shine again.
And I will kiss your face
And I will make you smile again.

And then the whole damn town will come on out to welcome me.
Oh, they will open all the door and give it all to me.
Oh, no, but still your voice is ringing in my ears:
"Don't you want me anymore?
Don't you want me anymore?"

Oh, no, I can't, I can't believe what's happening.
Oh, no, there, oh, there must be some mistake.
You've found yourself another lover
And you're glad we made the break.
Oh, you don't even, you don't even wanna see me,
You just wanna wave and say goodbye.
"Go away now and leave us alone,
No, this house is not your home."
Ahh.

And now the whole damn town has come on out to laugh at me.
Oh, yeah.

As the sun shines down on the land
So her heart is crying for love.
And there is no-one there,
No-one to hear her voice,
And she will sleep alone again tonight.
Now the moon is high in the sky.
In her room she calls out his name.
But he is somewhere else,
Somewhere she cannot see.
Oh, and the night is dark between them now.
My God! My God!
Why did he go away?

Now the sun shines on a new town.
With a smile he gets off the train.
He lights a cigarette,
Leans back to see the sky,
Oh, and he thinks how much better off he is
Without her hanging round.
(Let's do it.)

The day is passing by him
And he has nowhere to stay.
At a lonely bar and table
His mind goes back to yesterday.
To the girl who's getting buried
But her face lives in his eyes.
He must forget that face forever,
Make the future start tonight.
(Forget it.)

He delineates his dead flesh
There is cancer in his cigarettes
And the drinks won't do a thing for him,
But revive some stupid memories.
And a hairstyle that reminds him,
Makes him look into the night.
Where the moon hangs high above them now,
The same moon she's praying on tonight.

But the wind catches her words
And the moon swallows them whole.

And now the moon is high in the sky.
In her room she calls out his name.
The night is cold and dark,
And she is all alone,
The bed is empty now,
Her body screams for love.
She wants to be with him,
Oh, but he's so far away.
Oh, and the night is dark
Between them now.
My God! My God!
Why did he go
Away?

To dive down and reach you again.

[Hush, keep very still,

Oh, I was seventeen,
When I heard the countdown start.
It started slowly,
I thought it was my heart,
But then I realised
That this time it was for real.
There was no place to hide
I had to go out and feel
That there was time to kill.
I walked my way round town.
I tried to love the world,
Oh, but the world just got me down
And so I looked for you
In every street of every town.
I wanna see your face,
I wanna, I wanna see you now.
Yeah, I wanna see you now.

And so it went,
So it went for several years.
I couldn't stand it.
Oh, it must be getting near (oh, no)
But you just don't know,
No you just don't understand
How many times I've seen you
In the arms of some other man.
I've got to meet you,
And find you,
And take you by the hand.
My God! My God!
You've got to understand
That I was seventeen.
I didn't know a thing at all.
I've got no reason,
No reason at all. Oh, no.

Aahhh,
Time of my life
I think you came too soon
(You came too soon, babe.)
Oh, and it could
Be tonight
If I ever leave this room.
(I never leave this room)
Oh,oh,oh
Wasting all my time in all those stupid things
That only get me down.
(Get down, oh)
Oh, And the sky is crying out tonight
For me to leave this town.
So I'm gonna go,
Really,
Bye bye.

Yeah, you can leave me,
You can go some other place
You can forget it.
Oh, that's okay because
I own this town.
I brought it to its knees.
Can't you hear it crying,
Can you hear it begging to be pleased.
I know its coming,
So soon now;
It's on its way.
Oh, no, my God! My God!
I can hear them say:
They say it's all a lie
They say I'll never leave the ground
They say I can't survive.
Oh, but it's coming down!
Oh baby, now, please.

Aahhh,

I think you came too soon

You owe nothing
You owe nothing to me.
And if I mess it up big, then,
Then that's all up to me.
And if you go,
Then I won't follow, no.

I've been thinking maybe I should.
No, I'm gonna stay

(spoken) You know, sometimes
When we're lying together
And I know you're asleep;
I can hear the soft sound of your breathing.
So I get up
And I go to the window.
Outside I can see all the houses,
Curtains shut tight against the night,
Asleep beneath the rooftiles.
And I stand there I wonder,
I wonder how many more times
I'm gonna come here.
I wonder how many more times
I'm gonna lie here.
But most of all,
Most of all I wonder,
I wonder what it means.
I just wonder what it means.

So I woke her,
And we went walking through the sleeping town,
Down deserted streets,
Through the gardens grey in the moonlight,
Fences,
Down to the canal.
Creeping slowly past cooling towers,
Deserted factories,
Looking for adventure.
I wandered the streets calling your name,
Jumping walls,
Hoping to see a light in a window.
Let me in. Let me come in. Let me in tonight.
I see you shivering in the garden.
I see your gooseflesh in the moonlight.
She's about the same.
There are so many others
That're on my rounds tonight        « unsure about this line.
... afternoons,
She was balancing, balancing
On the edge of ugliness tonight.
She's balancing.
Good God!

She is crying tonight.
Oh, no, she doesn't feel right,
She's got no-one to hold.
Her love is a sham,
He is dancing somewhere.
Oh, no, he doesn't care.
Oh, well he'll never know.

Touch me. Now.
Ohhh.
Come on.
I don't care
'Cause tonight maybe we can,
Maybe we can
Maybe we can
Touch the sky.
Do you think that we could?
Do you think that we could
Touch the sky?
Please?
Oh, I know
I know it's, it's not forever, tonight;
I don't care.
Your skin so pale in the moonlight.
Oh!
Nobody looks on when you're asleep
Nothing else matters.
Do you know how much I want you?
Can you fell how much I want you?
Oh, this poor woman,
Oh, oh lets ... you today.

My legendary girlfriend,
She is crying tonight.
Oh, no, she doesn't feel right,
She's got no-one to hold.
Her love is a sham,
He is dancing somewhere.
Oh, no, he doesn't care.
Oh, well he'll never know.
And all the stars come out tonight,
And the moon came on her face,
It shone right through the clothes she wore.
It shone right through the dress she wore.

Good God!
Oh, yeah.
Oh, listen, listen, please.
Oh.
I just wanna.
I just wanna.
Ah-ah. Ah!
You don't understand.
It's not that bad anymore.

You said you wanted some space,
Well is this enough for you?
This is what you've waited for,
No dust collecting in the corners
Or cups of tea that go cold before you drink them.
Tonight, travelling at the speed of thought,
We're going to escape to the stars.
It doesn't matter if the lifts are out of order
Or the car won't start,
We're rising up above the city
Over forests and fields,
Rivers and lakes into the clouds
And high above us the whole universe is sining a welcome.
Did you ever think this day would happen?
After days of trying to sell washing machines in the rain
It looked like we'd never leave the ground,
But we're weightless, floating free,
We can go wherever we want,
Solar systems, constellations, galaxies -
I'll race you to the nearest planet.
How many times have you wished upon a star?
Now you can touch it,
You can touch the stars.
Go on, don't be afraid.
I remembered you wanted some space,
Well, is this enough for you?
Is it?
Oh the stars are bright,
But they don't give out any heat.
The planets are lumps of rock
Floating in a vacuum.
Yeah, space is cold when you're on your own.
I think it's time to go home.
Pull my string,
Like a kite that flew too high,
Now it's time to come down.
Look out below.
Wait 'til I get back, you're going to see something.
Yeah I wanted some space but now I know:
It's OK,
Space is OK,
But I'd rather get my kicks down below.

Well it happened years ago
When you lived on Stanhope Road.
We listened to your sister
When she came home from school
'Cause she was two years older
And she had boys in her room,
We listened outside and heard her
Alright.
Well that was alright for a while
But soon I wanted more.
I want to see as well as hear, so I -
I hid inside her wardrobe,
And she came home round four,
And she was with some kid called David,
Ah, from this garage up the road.
I listened outside; I heard her
Alright.

Oh, I wanna take you home;
I wanna give you children;
And you might be my girlfriend;
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

When I saw you next day,
I really couldn't tell
'Cause you might go and tell your mother,
And so you went with Neve,
Oh, yeah, and Neve was coming on
And I thought I heard you laughing
When his mum and dad were gone.
I listened outside, I heard you.
Alright.

Oh, I wanna take you home;
I wanna give you children;
And you might be my girlfriend;
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Well I guess it couldn't last too long.
I came home one day, and all her things were gone.
I fell asleep inside, I never heard her come
Oh, and opened up the wardrobe and I had to get it on.
Oh, we were on the bed when you came home,
I heard you stop outside the door.
I know you won't believe it's true,
I only went with her 'cause she looked like you!
My God!

Oh, I wanna take you home;
I wanna give you children;
And you might be my girlfriend;

After many weeks in the wilderness
We came upon a strange exotic land,
A land of happy hours, where the sky is always grey,
And the food exceptionally greasy.
We drank strange brown liquids
And our stomachs swelled up like balloons.
A thousand fake orgasms every night,
Behind thick draylon curtains.

They go on and on and on and on.

We sank back into mauve PVC sofas.
Outside the dogs roam the streets
And the rooftops glisten with rain.
But now we have grown so fat we can no longer pass through the door.
So stay we must, sprouting black hair
From beneath bri-nylon underwear.
Yes, here we'll stay,
'Cause those nights of suburbia
Go on and on and on and on.

Three weeks after I left you
Now you're going with some kid,
Looks like some bad comedian.
Are you gonna go out or are you staying at home
Eating boxes of Milk Tray?
Watch TV on your own. Oh, aren't you the one?

Waiting for a test,
Trying to look like some kind of heiress,
But your face is such a mess.
And going to a party and then leaving on your own.
Oh, I'm sorry, but didn't you say
Things go better with a little razzmatazz?

And now no-one's gonna care
If you don't call them when you said.
And he's not coming round tonight

And you wish that you were dead.

Not your brother, not your mother, your ah!

The sun rose from behind the gasometers at 6:30 AM,
Crept through the gap in your curtains
And caressed your bare feet poking from beneath the floral sheets.
I watched it flaking bits of varnish from your nails,
Trying to work its way up under the sheets.
Jesus!
Even the sun's on heat today!
The whole city getting stiff in the building heat.
I just wanna make contact with you.
Oh, that's all I wanna do.
I just wanna make contact with you.
Oh, that's all I wanna do.
Oh.

Now I'm trying hard to meet her,
But the fares went up at seven.
She is somewhere in the city,
Somewhere watching television.
Watching people being stupid,
Doing things she can't believe in.
Love won't last 'till the next installment:
Ten o' clock on Tuesday evening.
And the world is going on outside,
The night is gaping open wide
And the wardrobe and the chest of drawers
Are telling her to go outdoors.
He should have been here by this time,
He said that he'd be here by nine,
That guy is such a prick sometimes,
I don't know why you bother really.

Oh, babe,
Oh, I'm sorry,
But I
I just had to
Make love to every crack in the pavement
And the shop doorways and the,
And the rain
Reflected your face in my eyes.

The day didn't go too well.
Too many chocolates and cigarettes.
I kept thinking of you and almost walking into lamp-posts.
Why is it so hot?
The air coming to the boil,
Rubbing up against walls and lamp-posts trying to get rid of it.
Old women clack their tongues
In the shade of crumbling concrete bus-shelters.
Dogs doing it (Ohh!)
In central reservations
And causing multiple pile-ups in the centre of town.
I didn't want to go
In the first place,
But I've been sentenced to three years
In the housing benefit waiting room.
I must have lost your number in the all-night garage,
And now I'm wandering up and down your street
Calling your name
In the rain.
Whilst my shoes turn to sodden cardboard.

Where are you?
=>(I'm here.)

=>(I'm here.)

I'm still trying hard to meet you,
But it doesn't look like happening,
'Cause the city's out to get me
'Cause I won't sleep with her this evening.
Though her buildings are impressive,
And her cul-de-sacs amazing,
She's had too many lovers,
And I know you're out there waiting.
And now she's getting into bed.
He's had his chance, now it's too late.
The carpet's screaming for her soul,
The darkness wants to eat her whole.
Tonight must be the night it ends.
Tomorrow she will call her friends
And go out on her own somewhere.
Who need this shit anyway?

Listen.
I wandered the streets
The whole night
Trying to pick up your scent,
Writing messages on walls
And the rain reflected your face in my eyes.

We finally made it.
On a hilltop at 4 AM.
The whole city is your jewellery box.
A million twinkling yellow street lights.
Reach out and take what you want.
You can have it all.
Jesus it took a long time.
I didn't think we were going to make it.
So bad during the day but
Now snug and warm under an eiderdown sky.
Oh the things we saw:
Everyone on Park Hill cam in unison at 4:30 AM
And the whole block fell down.
A tobacconist caught fire
And everyone in the street died of lung cancer.
We heard grons from a T-reg chevette.
You bet.
You bet, yeah,
You bet.
And tomorrow we're gonna
We're gonna

@NODE SUSAN "Inside Susan - Cocker, Banks, Mackey, Senior, Doyle "
@{u}Inside Susan (1993)@{uu}
Susan catches a bus into town at 10:30 AM
Sits on the back seat.
She looks at the man in front's head
And thinks that his fat wrinkled neck looks like a large carrot
Sticking out of the collar of his shirt.
She adds up the numbers on her bus ticket to see if they make 21
But they don't.
Maybe she shouldn't bother going to school at all then.
Her friends will be in the yard, arms folded on their chests,
Pushing up their breasts to try to make them look bigger.
While the boys will be too busy playing football to notice.

The bus is waiting on the high street when it
Suddenly begins to rain torrentially. And it sounds
As if someone has emptied about a million packets of dries peas
Onto the roof of the bus.
"What if it just keeps raining?" she thinks to herself,
"And it was just like being in an aquarium except it was all the
Shoppers and office workers floating past the windows instead of fish."
She is still thinking of this as the bus goes past Caroline Lee's house
Where there was a party last week.
There were some german exchange students over, who were very immature.
They ended up jumping out of the bedroom window.
One of them tried to get her to kiss him on the stairs.
So she kicked him.
Later she was sick because she drank too much cider.
Caroline was drunk as well. She was pretending that she was married
To a tall boy with glasses,
And had to wear a polo neck for three days afterwards
To cover up the lovebite on her neck.

By now the bus is going past the markets.
Outside is a man who spends all day forcing felt-tip pens into people's hands
And then trying to make them pay for them.
She used to work in a pet shop there, but
She got the sack for talking to boys when she was supposed to be working.
She wasn't too bothered though; she hated the smell of the rabbits anyway.
"Maybe this bus won't stop," she thinks,
"And I'll stay on it until I'm old enough to go into pubs on my own
And it'll drive me to a town where people with black hair are treated specially
And I can make lots of money from charging fat old men
Five pounds a time to look up my skirt.
And they'll all be queuing up to take me out to dinner."

I suppose you think she's just a silly girl with stupid ideas,
But I remember her in those days.
They talk about people with the fire within and all that stuff, well,
She had that alright -
It's just that no-one dared to jump into her fire
And risk being consumed.
Instead they put her in the corner and let her heat up the room,
Warming their hands and backsides in front of her
And then slagging her off round town.
No-one ever really got inside Susan
And she always ended up getting off the bus at the terminus.
And walking home.

Stripped floorboards in the kitchen and the hall.
A stain from last weeks party on the stairs.
But no-one knows who made it, or how it ever got there.
They were dancing with children round their necks
Talking business, books and records, art and sex.
All things being considered, you'd call it a success.
You wore your black dress.

Oh, he's an architect, and such a lovely guy
And he'll stay with you until the day you die.
And he'll give you everything that you desire,
Oh, well almost everything; everything that he can buy.
So you sometimes go out in the afternoon,
Spend an hour with your lover in his bedroom.
Hearing old women rolling trolleys down the road
Back to Lyndhurst Grove.

Well it might take you a little time,

As it travels though the sky.
'Cause she's heard it's romantic.
Though she really can't see why.
Someone should have helped her through the day,
Someone like the moon.

So she drinks her cup of coffee
And telephones a friend,
And she asks if she can make it,
So this night will never end.
And someone should have helped her though the day.
Someone like the moon.

But the light comes,
And the day bleeds through the sky,
And the sun makes it hard to get through.
And the radio only plays love songs
And she cries, though she knows
It's such a bad thing to do.

In the evening, it gets better,
And she thinks how it's not right.
That someone so stupid
Can so easily screw up your life.

@{u}David's Last Summer (1994)@{uu}
We made our way slowly down the path that led to the stream,
Sweating slightly, drunk on the sun I suppose.
It was a warm Summer's day, the air humming with heat,
Whilst the trees beckoned us into their cool, green shade.
And when we reached the stream,
I put a bottle of cider into the water to chill,
Both of us knowing that we'd drink it long before it had chance.

Oh, this is where you want to be,
There's nothing else but you and her,
And how you use your time.

Walking to parties whilst it's still light outside.
Peter was upset at first, but now he's in the garden
Talking to somebody Polish.
Why don't we set up a tent and spend the night out there?
And we can pretend that we're somewhere foreign
But we'll still be able to use the fridge
If we get hungry or too hot.

Oh, this is where you want to be,
There's nothing else but you and her,
And how you spend your time.

We went driving.

Oh, this is where you want to be,
There's nothing else but you and her,
And how you spend your time.

The room smells faintly of sun tan lotion
And when you take off your clothes
You're still wearing a small, pale skin bikini.
The sound of children playing in the park comes from far away.
And time slows down to the speed of the specks of dust
Floating in the light from the window.

Summer leaves fall from Summer trees.
Summer grazes fade on Summer knees.
Summer nights are slowly getting long.
Summer's dying; so hurry, soon be gone.

So we went out to the park at midnight one last time.
Past the abandoned glass house stuffed dull of dying palms.
Past the bandstand and down to the boating lake.
And we swam in the moonlight for what seemed like jours
Until we couldn't swim any more.
And as we came out of the water,
We both sensed a certain movement in the air
And we both shivered slightly
And we ran to collect our clothes.
And as we walked home, we could hear the leaves
Curling and turning brown on the trees,
The birds deciding where to go for the Winter.
And the whole sound,
The whole sound of Summer
Packing it's bags
And preparing to leave town.

Ohhh, I want you to stay (hay-hay)
Stay, stay.
I want you to stay (ayy)
Oh, I want you to stay.

Oh please stay for a while,
I don't want to live in the cold.

Oh, children of the future,
Conceived in the toilets of Meadowhall,
To be raised on cheap corn snacks and garage food,
Rolling empty cans down the stairway
(Don't you love that sound?)
And the thoughts...head

Master said he wasn't allowed in here.
So why don't you get lost?
And if you're good,
Then when you grow up maybe,
Maybe you could live,
Live in Kelvin.
Yeah, you could live in Kelvin.
On the promenade of concrete walkways,
Where pigeons go to die.

Ohhh.

The woman on the fourteenth floor noticed that her ceiling was bulging,
As if under a great weight.
When the council investigated, they discovered that the man in
The flat above had transported a large quantity of soil into his living room,
In which several plants he had stolen from a local park were growing.
When questioned, the man said all he wanted was a garden.

We don't need your sad attempts at social conscience
Based on taxi-rides home at night from exhibition openings.
We just want your car radio
And those Reflex speakers.
Now.
Suffer little children to come unto me,
And I will tend their adventure playgrounds,
Splinters and cigarette burns,
And feed them fizzy orange and chips.
And then they grow up straignt and tall,
And then they grow up to live,
In Kelvin.

Oh yeah, we can have ghettoes too.
Only we use air rifles instead of machine guns.
Stitch that.
And we drink Diamond White.
In the end, the question you have to ask yourself is:
Are you talking to me,
Or are you chewing a brick?

She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge.
She studied sculpture at St. Martin's College
That's where I
Caught her eye.
She told me that her dad was loaded, I said
"In that case I'll have a rum and coca-cola,"
She said "Fine."
And in thirty seconds time
She said "I wanna live like Common People,
I wanna do whatever Common People do,
I wanna sleep with Common People,
I wanna sleep with Common People, like you."
Well, what else could I do?
I said "Hold on, I'll see what I can do."

I took her to a supermarket,
I don't know why, but I had to start it
Somewhere.
So it started there.
I said "Pretend you've got no money."
She said "Oh, you're so funny!"
And I said "Yeah? Well I can't see anyone else smiling in here.
Are you sure
You wanna live like Common People,
You wanna see whatever Common People see,
You wanna sleep with Common People,
You wanna sleep with Common People like me?"
But she didn't understand.
And she just smiled and held my hand.

Rent a flat above a shop.
And cut your hair and get a job.
Smoke some fags and play some pool,
Pretend you never went to school.
But still you'll never get it right,
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad you could stop it all, yeah!
You'll never live like Common People,
You'll never do whatever Common People do.
You'll never fail like Common People,
You'll never watch your life slide out of view.
And then dance and drink (and screw)
Because there's nothing else to do.

Sing along with the Common People,
Sing along and it might just get you through.
Laugh along with the Common People,
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you.
And the stupid things that you do
Because you think that poor is cool!

[
Like a dog lying in a corner
They will bite you and never warn you.
Look out,
They'll tear your insides out.
'Cause everybody hates a tourist.
Specially one that thinks it's all such a laugh.
And those chip-stains and grease will come out in the bath.
You will never understand
How it feels to live your life
With no meaning or control
And with nowhere left to go.
You are amazed that they exist
And they burn so bright that you can only wonder why.

Rent a flat above a shop.
And cut your hair and get a job.

In the world;
In the whole wide world.
Oh, you didn't do bad,
You made it out.
I'm still stuck here,
Oh, but I'll get out.
Oh yeah, I'll get out.

Can't you see a giant walks amongst you,
Seeing through your petty lives?
Do you think I do these thinks for real?
I do these things just so I survive.
And you know - I will survive.
It may look to the untrained eye
I'm sitting on my arse all day.
But I'm biding time until I take you all on,
My Lords and Ladies,
I will prevail,
I cannot fail,
'Cause I spy.

Oh, I've got your number, taken notes,
I know the way your minds work. I have studied.
And your minds are just the same as mine,
Except that you are clever swines,
You never let your masks slip,
You never admit to it,
You're never hurried.
Oh no, no, no

And every night I hone my plan -
How I will get my satisfaction
How I will blow your paradise away.
'Cause I spy.

(spoken) Yeah, it's just like in the old days.
I used to compose my own critical notices in my head:
"The crowd gasp at Cocker's masterful control of the bicycle,
Skillfully avoiding the dog-turd outside the corner shop."
Imagining a blue plaque above
The place I first ever touched a girl's chest.
But hold on -
You've got to wait ... for the best.
You see you should take me seriously,
Very seriously indeed.
'Cause I've been sleeping with your wife
For the past sixteen weeks.
Smoking your fags,
Drinking your brandy,
Messing up the bed that you chose together.
And in all that time
I just wanted you to come home one afternoon,
And catch us "at it" in the front room.
You see I spy for a living,
And I specialise in revenge.
I'm taking the things I know will cause you pain.
I can't help it.
I was dragged up.
My favourite parks are car parks.
Grass is something you smoke.
Birds are something you shag.
Take your "Year in Provence" and
Shove it up your ass!

Your Ladbroke Grove looks turn me on, yeah!
With roach burns in designer dresses,
Skin stretched tight over high cheek bones,
And thousands of tiny dryness lines
Beating a path,
Beating a path to the corner of your eyes.
And every night I hatch my plan.
It's not a case of woman v man,
It's more a case of haves against haven'ts,
And I just happen
to have got what you need.
Just exactly what you need, yeah!

La la, la-la-la-la lah la la-la
(In the midnight hour)
La la, la-la-la-la lah la la-la
(I will come to you.)
I will come to you.
I will take you from this sickness,
Dinner parties and champagne,
I'll hold your body
And make it sing again;
Come on,
Sing again, yeah, sing again,
Ohhhh
'Cause I spy,
Yeah, I spy.

(Spoken) I spy a boy
And I spy a girl.
I spy a chance
To change the world.
To change your world.

Well we were born within an hour of each other,
Our mothers said we could be sister and brother.
Your name was Deborah.
Deborah.
It never suited ya.
Oh, and they said that when we grew up,
We'd get married and never split up.
Oh, we never did it.
Although
I often thought of it.
Oh deborah, do you recall,
Your house was very small,
With wood-chip on the wall,
And when I came round to call,
You didn't notice me at all,
And I said

"Lets all meet up in the year 2000,
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown.
Be there, two o'clock
By the fountain down the road."
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own.
On that damp and lonely
Thursday, years ago.

You were the first girl at school to get breasts,
And Martyn said that you were the best.
The boys all loved you, but I was a mess.
I had to watch them try and get you undressed.
We were friends and that's as far as it went.
I used to walk you home sometimes, but it meant -
It meant nothing to ya.

She doesn't have to go to work.
But she doesn't want to stay in bed.
'Cause it's changed from something wonderful
To something else instead.

Oh, this bed has seen it all,
From the first time to the last.
The silent sins of now,
And the good times of the past.
And it only cost ten pounds,
From the shop just down the road.
Mind you, that was seven years ago,
And things were very different then.

It didn't get much rest at first;
The headboard banging in the night.
The neighbours didn't dare complain,
Oh, everything was going right.
Now there's no need to complain,
'Cause it never makes a sound.
Something beautiful left town
And she never even knew its name.

Now every night she plays a sad game.
(Oh, oh-oh, ohhh)
Pretending nothing's going wrong.
(Oh, oh-oh, ohhh)
Oh but tonight,
If this show was televised,
No-one would watch it, not tonight,
But seven years ago,

Oh, I could have stayed at home and gone to bed.
I could have gone to see a film instead.
You might have changed your mind and seen your friends.
Life could have been very different but then -
Something changed.

Do you believe that there's someone up above?
And does he have a time-table, directing out of love?
Why did I write this song on that one day?
Why did you touch my hand and softly say:
"Stop asking questions that don't matter anyway.
Just give us a kiss to celebrate her today -
Something changed."

And when we woke up this morning
We had no way of knowing
That in a matter of hours
We'd change the way we were going.
Where would I be now,
Where would I be now if we'd never met?
Would I be singing this song to someone else instead?
I don't know, but like you just said -
Something changed.

'Cause all this has just got to mean something.

Got the tickets from some fucked [mashed] up bloke in Camden Town.
Oh and no-one seems to know exactly where it is.

Everybody asks your name,
They say we're all the same
And now it's "Nice one!",
"Geezer!"
But that's as far as the conversation went.
I lost my friends, I danced alone
It's six o'clock, I wanna go home,
But it's "No way,"
"Not today,"
Makes you wonder what it meant (ta-da)
And this hollow feeling grows and grows.
And you want to call your mother and say:
"Mother, I can never come home again,
'Cause I seem to have left a part of my brain
Somewhere,
Somewhere,
In a field in Hampshire." Alright.

If I close my eyes, I can visualise everything in it,
Right down, right down to the broken handle
On the third draw down of the dressing table.

And as I touch your shoulder tonight,
This room has become the centre of the entire universe.

Like I'm standing on top of a very high building. Oh yeah,

But this isn't chocolates and roses - it's dirtier than that.

And the curve of your belly
And they make me have to sit down and catch my breath.

We didn't have nowhere to live
We didn't have nowhere to go
'Til someone said
"I've found this place off Birdy Road." « Unsure about the road name.
It was on the fifteenth floor,
It had a board across the door.
It took an hour
To prize it off and get inside.
It smelt as if someone had died,
The living room was full of flies,
The kitchen sink was blocked,
The bathroom sink not very tall      « Unsure about this line.
Ohhhh, it's a mess alright
It's Mile End.

And now we're living in the sky.
I never though I'd live so high.
Just like heaven
If it didn't look like hell.
The lift is always full of piss,
The fifth floor landing smells of fish
Not just on Friday,
Every single other day.
Then all the kids come out at night,
They kick a ball and have a fight.
And maybe shoot somebody if they lose at pool.
Ohhh, it's a mess alright, yes
It's Mile-hile End.

Dont want to go there...
Ohhhhh-ohhhhhh

Nobody wants to be your friend
'Cause you're not from round here...
As if that was
Something to be proud about.
... king in the Isle of Dogs,
Fields of children in the bogs,
Down by the playing field,
Someone sets a car on fire.
I guess you have to go right down
Before you understand just how
How low,
How low a human being can go.
Ohhh, it's a mess alright, yes
It's Mile-hile End.

Or does it?

This is our "Music From A Bachelor's Den" -
The sound of loneliness turned up to ten.
A horror soundtrack from a stagnant waterbed.
And it sounds just like this.
This is the sound of someone losing the plot,
Making out that they're okay when they're not.
You're gonna like it, but not a lot.
And the chorus goes like this:

Oh, baby,
Here comes the fear again (woah-ho)
The end is near again (woah-ho-ho-ho)
A monkey's built a house on your back. (Tsa-tsa)
You can't get anyone to come in the sack. (Tsa-tsa)
And here comes another panic attack, oh,
Here we go again.

So now you know the words to our song,
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along
When you're sad, and you're lonely, and it all turns out wrong.
When you've got the fear.
And when you're no longer searching for beauty or love
Just some kind of life where the edge is taken off,
When you can't even define what it is that you're frightened of,
This song will be here:

Oh, baby,
Here comes the fear again (woah-ho)
The end is near again (woah-ho)
If you ever get that chimp off your back (tsa-tsa)
If you ever find the thing that you lack (tsa-tsa)
Oh, but you know you're only having a laugh, oh
And here we go again...

Just for the surface and your fear
That just won't go
So come on and hold me.
Come on and hold me,
Hold me, hold me... ah ah ah!

@NODE PROFESSIONAL "The Professional - Cocker, Banks, Mackey, Doyle, Webber "
@{u}The Professional (1998)@{uu}
Tune in.

I'm back and full of it
I can't even hold myself erect
I got nothin', no, honestly,
I'm gonna say it, anyway:
I know you think I've lost it, baby,
I know you think that my star is fading.
I used to be a contender,
Now you're just a pretender,
Stuck at karaoke every weekend.
You don't fit those clothes any more
Why don't you take them back to the charity store?
While you're there you could always hand yourself in.
The inter-???? is start recycling
You haven't had your woman on an hour or ten              « unsure
Sure, who can blame her for holding you down?
Holding you down?
Holding you down?
You're the only one who's holding you down.
You're only ever polite when you're out of your box
Cocker's short for: Sucker!
A sucker, oh!

Ohh-ohh
Ahhh Ohh-oh-oh-oh.
A sucker, Ahh!
Ohhh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ohhh

Well at the corner today I had that feeling again
Everything was OK then the world started sinking
And now I'm trying to sleep it away
Ohh, but I can't sleep it away.
Can you answer this question, can you answer it right:
Have you ever done anything good in your life?
Have you ever done anything that wasn't just for yourself?
Are you capable of giving?
Yeah, keep on giving just for the sake of it,
Without expecting anything in return?
I'm only trying to give you what you've come to expect
Just another song about single mothers 'n' sex,
Single mothers 'n' sex,
Single mothers 'n' sex,
Just another song about single mother's 'n' sex.
OK, you've heard it before, it's nothing special
It's a living, can't you see?
I'm a professional.

Ohh-ohh
Ahhh Ohh-oh-oh-oh.
I'm a professional
Ohhh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ohhh

Sleep on my darling
Sleep on,
The word isn't due.
I've been feeling sorry for so long now.
Don't interrupt me as I dump you.
The bedroom fool is treacherous,
A teacup could be disastrous,
As some wino would have to say:
Always weep on ??? posted yesterday.
So they would give
When I was gone and you woke up.

Ohhh
She won't need for my time
And she won't know a thing
About how I talk with my mouth full and only bath once a week,
How I'm nicer the first time you meet me than the next,
And I'm rapidly losing interest in sex.
Yeah, I'm rapidly losing interest in sex.
What's the point in making it over-emotional?
You can do the hard way,
Or you can be a professional.

Ohh-ohh
Ahhh Ohh-oh-oh-oh.
I'm a professional.
Ohhh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ohhh
(Oh, baby)

Sleep on my darling,
Sleep on my love.
Sleep on my darling,
Sleep on my love.
Sleep on my darling,
Sleep on my love.
Sleep on my darling,
Sleep on my love.
Sleep on my darling,

@{u}Cocaine Socialism (1998)@{uu}
I thought that you were joking,
When you said "I want to see ya,
To discuss your contribution
To the future of our nation's heart and soul (ohh).
Six o clock, my place, Whitehall. (all-all.)"

Well, I arrived just after seven,
But you said, "It doesn't matter.
I understand your situation
And your image; and I'm flattered.
Oh, and I'd just like to tell ya
That I love all of your albums.
Would you sign this for my daughter,
She's in hospital, her name is Miriam.
Now I'll get down to the gist.
Do you want a lot of this?
Are you a Socialist?

Doing fine. (Yeah!)
Buzzing all the time.
Just one hit,
And I feel great.
And I support
The Welfare State.
Ah, you must be a socialist
'Cause you're always off out on the piss
In your private Member's Bar,
Ah, yes you are, ya superstar.

Ah, you sing about Common People
And the Mis-Shapes and the Misfits,
So can ya bring them to my party
And get them all to sniff this?
Oh, and all I'm really saying,
Is 'Come on and rock the vote for me.'
All I'm really saying
Is 'Come on, roll up that note for me.'
Ya trust in all the wishes
Do you want hits or do you want misses?
Are you a Socialist, yeah,
Socialist, yeah,
Socialist, yeah?
Oh, yeah!

Ahhhh,
You can be just what you want to be.
Oh, just as long
As you don't try to compete with me.
And we've waited such a long time,
For a chance to hold our own council,
And please come on and tow the party line.
Oh, ya owe it to yourself,
Don't sleep with anybody else.
And we promise we won't tell,
No we won't tell,
We won't tell.

No, we won't
No, we won't
No, we won't
No, we won't tell.

@NODE LIKE_FRIEND "Like A Friend - Cocker, Banks, Mackey, Doyle, Webber "
@{u}Like A Friend (1998)@{uu}
Don't bother saying you're sorry.
Why don't you come in?
Smoke all my cigarettes again.
Every time I get no further,
How long has it been?
Come on in now, wipe your feet
On my dreams.

You've taken my time
Like some cheap magazine
When I could have been learning something,
Oh, well you know what I mean, Oh
I've done this before
And I will do it again
Come on and kill me, baby,
While you smile like a friend.
Oh, and I'll come running.
Just to do it again.

You are the last drink I never should have drunk.
You are the body hidden in the trunk.
You are the habit I can't seem to kick.
You are the secrets on the front page every week.
You are the car I never should have bought.
You are the train I never should have caught.
You are the gun that makes me hide my face.
You are the party that makes me feel my age.
You're like the crime which I can see but I just can't report.
Like the plane I've been told I never should board.
Like a film that's so bad but I've gotta stay 'til the end.
Let me tell you now, it's lucky for you that we're friends.
Mmm.
Mmm.

@NODE BOYZ "We Are The Boyz - Cocker, Banks, Mackey, Doyle, Webber "
We are the boyz
And we are class at
Getting trash
So make some noise.
We are the boyz.

We are the lads
We sleep with slags
We nick their fags
We got no choice.
We are the boyz.

Oh, we are the boyz
We don't ask why
Because we're lads.
We are the boyz.

We are the boyz,
We're in the place,
So shut your face!
You got no choice.
We are the boyz.

We are the guyz
We're getting high
While you're getting by
So let's make some noise!
'Cause we are the boyz.

Oh, we are the boyz
We don't ask why
'Cause we're always right;
Because we're alive.
Oh we are the boyz!

Du du duh
Du du duh

We are the boyz
And don't look now
'Cause we're coming down
The radio noise
'Cause we are the boyz.

Now we are the men
And that was then.
It won't happen again
'Cause we had no choice.
'Cause we're the boyz.

We were the boyz
We're not anymore,
No, now we're secure,
Now we got insured,
Because we're not so sure,
No, we're not so sure.
Ah, no we're not so sure.
Not so sure!
Not so sure as we were!
When we were the boyz.
We were the boyz.
Ah, we were the boyz!

Come on!
We're still the boyz!
We're still the boyz!
Oh, we're still the boyz!
Ahhh, come on we are the boyz!
Ah, we are the boyz!
We are the boyz!
