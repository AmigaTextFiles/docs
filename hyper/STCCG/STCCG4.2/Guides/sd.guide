  @{b}Using the Star Trek Customizable Card Game Official Tournament Sealed Deck@{ub}

  This unique and exciting product has been designed to foster
  exciting and enjoyable sealed-deck play. We hope this will provide
  all the information you need. If not, here's how you can get more:

  Contact Sean Smallman(tournaments@decipher.com)
  757-664-1152, for more information about running tournaments.

  Contact Marcus Certa(emissary@decipher.com)
  757-664-1155, for information about demos and special promotions.

  So why did Decipher make the Official Tournament Sealed Deck?
  In a sealed-deck tournament, players do not bring their own
  cards but instead use unopened packs which they normally purchase
  as part of the entrance fee. This is a great way to bring new
  players into the game! However, it has one drawback. Sometimes the
  basic ingredients for a great deck are not obtained from the
  purchased mix of starter decks and booster packs.

  The Official Tournament Sealed Deck solves this problem! The
  special pack of 20 cards(black-border) contained in every
  box provides the necessary support cards for a playable deck.
  Combined with the four Premiere Unlimited (white-border) expansion
  packs and one Alternate Universe expansion pack, it gives every
  player the opportunity to create a potential winner!

  We are going to designate every tournament run using these
  products as 'enhanced format.' We feel this conveys the higher
  quality experience players will get when competing in these
  events! And these tournaments can be sanctioned, thereby
  contributing toward player ratings.

  We encourage you to use this product to run enhanced-format
  sealed-deck events. All you need to do is:

  * Assign an officially sanctioned tournament director to run the event
  * Collect the entry fee from each player
  * Supply each player with one of the enclosed boxes and let the games begin!



  @{b}The Enhanced-Format Sealed-Deck tournament@{ub}

  An enhanced-format sealed-deck tournament is played using the
  'Official Sealed Deck' for the Star Trek Customizable Card Game.
  Each player therefore starts with four Premier Unlimited booster
  packs, one Alternate Universe booster pack and the special
  20-card 'tourney' pack. Every retailer should have an ample
  supply of these products on hand for each player to have their own
  box. This format follows Decipher's sanctioning tournament
  program which requires at least three complete games.

  1. One Official Tournament Sealed Deck per player -
     Each player signed up for the tournament must pay an entry
     fee (recommended $10-$15) to play. Players will receive 
     their boxes after they have paid the entry fee. All
     packages must remain sealed until after the first
     pairings. 
  2. Distribute PADD display cards -
     Give each player a PADD display card to complete. If
     the card is not filled out correctly and legibly, that
     player may not be rated. (Please remind players to use 
     a consistent form for their name and address every time
     they enter a tournament. Switching between name,
     initial and nick-name will cause delays in getting the
     results incorporated into the ratings scheme.)
  3. First pairing - 
     Take the top two cards off the pile. Pair off these two cards, noting
     the name of each player's opponent on their PADD
     Display card. Then the third and fourth cards are paired,
     and so on. Continue pairing players in this way until all
     cards are drawn. You must note opponent's name on each card.
  4. Deck Construction -
     Each player now opens their deck and has 30 minutes to create 
     a 6-mission deck following the "30/30 rule" (maximum of
     30 seed cards, and minimum of 30 draw deck cards). Each
     player has 95 cards from which to build their deck. No
     other cards may be brought into the tournament or traded 
     for during the tournament.
  5. Starting play -
     Once decks are built, the first game should begin. If games are to
     be timed, the director must announce a time limit of no 
     less than 60 minutes per game at the beginning of the game.
     After each game, both players must report to the tournament
     director to have their scores recorded. (Scoring will be 
     explained in more detail below.) 
  6. Subsequent pairings - 
     When all players have completed play and have reported their
     first game results, place all PADD display cards in one
     pile. Arrange the cards in descending order according to 
     total score, with the highest score on top (see Tournament
     scoring for details) second highest score beneath it,
     etc. Pair the highest scoring player with the 
     second-highest scoring player, and so on, until all
     players have been paired. If there is an odd number of
     players, let the last player left receive the bye for the 
     next game. In forming subsequent pairings it is
     possible that players could face the same opponents more
     than once. An attempt must be made to modify the pairing.
     In this situation, pair the player with the next lowest
     player they have not faced before. However, in the rare
     case that the player has already faced all of the
     players remaining in the pile, then leave the pairing
     as it originally was.
  7. Deck adjustment -
     Before playing in the next game, players may re-customize
     their decks by swapping or adding cards to their play
     decks with any unused cards from their Official
     Tournament Sealed Deck.

  @{b}Tournament scoring@{ub}

  A player's score is a combination of victory points and differential
  points. Players generally score 2 victory points for a win, 0
  victory points for a loss. (Do not confuse victory points with the
  points that are accumulated during a game). In the case where a
  player wins by having more points when both players' decks are
  exhausted, only 1 victory point is awarded for the win. Differential
  points are determined by the difference between the winner's
  game point score and the loser's game point score. For the purposes
  of computing differential, if the game point score is less than zero
  treat it as zero; if it is greater than 100 treat it as a 100. The
  differential is always recorded in parentheses after the victory
  point score. Victory points are the first step in determining a 
  players score, differential points are used to determine
  tie-breakers. For example, a player with the score of 4 (+10)
  has a higher score than a player with 2 (+30).

  In a case where time has run out before a game has been completed,
  all players must stop playing and total their points. The player in
  each game with the greatest amount of points receives 1 victory point
  (plus their differential). 

  Examples of scoring: if a player won a game 120 to 65, he would
  receive a score of 2(+35) and his opponent would receive a score of
  0(-35). If a player won a game 80 to 20 (via deck exhaustion or
  timed game), he would receive a score of 1(+60) and his opponent
  would receive a score of 0(-60).

  After each game, update the player's cumulative score by 
  adding the vistory points and the differential for this game to his
  previous cumulative score. For example, a player has played two
  games. In the first he scored 2(+35) and in the second he scored
  0 (-60). His cumulative score at this point is 2 (-25).

  @{b}Determining the Tournament Winner@{ub}

  After the completion of all the rounds, the player with the
  highest victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie in
  victory points, the tied player with the highest differential wins
  the tournament.

  @{b}Returning the Results@{ub}

  For the tournament to be sanctioned, the results must be
  returned to Decipher (within one week of the event) for entry into
  the rating system. As long as the command cards are legible, and the
  sanctioning rules were followed, the results will be taken into
  account. Normally a tournament will be rated within 4 to 6 weeks
  of Decipher receiving the results.

@{b}Decipher Product News: Star Trek CCG Sealed Deck@{ub}

  ------------
  by Rich Loftus
  Web Writer
  ------------

  January 21 1998 - Decipher announces an
  official sealed-deck product for Star Trek
  Customizable Card Game. At last - one box
  containing all you need to participate in a
  challenging and balanced sealed-deck
  tournament. Designed for maximum value, the
  set's secret weapon is a fixed deck (the same
  in each and every set) of twenty new black
  border cards.

  Look for new doorways, outposts, ships and
  personnel in the twenty cards. The benefits
  are greater excitement and deck building
  opportunities for every Star Trek CCG player,
  and a more level playing field for Sealed
  Deck participants. Fair play, and exciting
  play. That's hot.

  Along with the special fixed deck, the set
  will contain four Premiere (white border)
  expansion packs and one Alternate Universe
  expansion pack, so there is also the chance
  of pulling the elusive Future Enterprise,
  still the most highly prized card in the Star
  Trek CCG universe.

  This game will be presented in six different
  box designs (each representing one of 6
  different affiliations: Federation, Klingon,
  Romulan, Borg, Cardassian, and Bajoran).
  However, each box will be covered in an
  external wrapper that will keep the pack
  design a surprise until it is opened. And,
  the box is cleverly sized to hold 300 cards
  unsleeved, 150 cards in protective sleeves,
  or three 50-card hard plastic boxes.

  The suggested retail price is not yet
  determined, but should be in the $15-20
  range. Look for a similar product for the
  Star Wars Customizable Card Game to be
  announced soon.
