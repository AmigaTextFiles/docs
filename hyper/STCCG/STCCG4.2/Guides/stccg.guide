        @{u}@{b}Requirements@{ub}@{uu}

STCCG.guide should work on any Amiga that has OS 2.1 or higher and has
the amigaguide.library and a viewer for amigaguide-files (e.g. multiview)
Of course, you could also use a text viewer...

To view the pictures linked in the guide you need a viewer (multiview
may be ok), which you have to specify during installation. You may get the
pictures (in GIF-Format) from Deciphers Web-Site.

Due to copyright reasons, the pictures are not part of this guide.

1MB of memory is enough for operation, but more memory is indeed
recommended.

I hope there aren't any:-)

But I expect a lot of missing/wrong links. It takes time to polish the
guide. Be patient...

Please report any missing/wrong links to the @{"author" link AUTHOR}, in
@{"Version 4.2" link V4_2} (as usual :-) all links should be fixed.
