Star Trekª Customizable Card Gameª
Rules of Acquisitionª Rules Supplement

One hundred and thirty cards. The Ferengi affiliation, Rules of
Acquisition cards, arms dealers, commercial exploitation,
vacuum-desiccated Ferengi remains, treachery, greed, bribery,
extortion...

"Deep down, everyone's a Ferengi" (the 284th Rule of Acquisition)

NEW RULES

Ferengi attack restrictions : The Ferengi affiliation has the standard
attack restriction: it may initiate battle against any affiliation
except its own (unless allowed by another card), but may return fire
and counter-attack against anyone.

Variable attributes : Some personnel have an X in one of their
attribute boxes, with a corresponding special skill such as X=2or7
Each time you need to know the value of a variable attribute, the owner
of the card may choose one of the listed values at that time ; it is
not necessary to specify one in advance. Whenever the special skill is
unusable (for example, because of Brain Drain or Hate Crime), the
attribute is undefined and thus treated as zero (like Mortal Q's
CUNNING).

Phasing Cloak : This device allows a ship and its crew to go "out of
phase" with the universe. The ship is both invisible and untouchable,
and thus can fly right through planets and other navigational
obstructions. In game terms, ships with this capability may "phase" or
"dephase" once each turn. (While phased, the ship receives a RANGE
enhancement as indicated on the card.)

Phasing has the same protections and restrictions as cloaking. In
addition, the ship and crew are not affected by external phenomena
(for example, Q-Net, Temporal Rift, Supernova, Space-Time Portal and
Anti-Matter Pod). However, they are still vulnerable to global effects
caused by changes in the timeline, such as Anti-Time Anomaly and Stop
First Contact.

Phasing and cloaking are separate game conditions; thus, cards such as
Tachyon Detection Grid, La Forge Maneuver, T'Rul and the Tachyon Drone
do not affect phased ships (but note that Engage Cloak specifically
states that it also works for phasing). If a ship has both a Cloaking
Device and a Phasing Cloak, it may perform only one cloaking,
decloaking, phasing or dephasing action each turn and it may not be
cloaked and phased at the same time.

NEW ICON

[Rule] : This "Rule" icon appears on Event cards implementing various
Ferengi Rules of Acquisition, as well as the Equipment card
representing the book of all 285 Rules. Its use is defined by various
cards in this expansion.


REVISED RULES

[Space] [Planet] Dual-Icon Missions : When a Space/Planet dilemma is
encountered during a dual-icon mission attempt, the player attempting
the mission must choose whether that dilemma applies to his crew or to
his Away Team. (Such dilemmas no longer apply to both groups.)

Jem'Hadar Suicide : The rule that Jem'Hadar must commit suicide when a
Founder dies is hereby canceled. (This function may appear on a card in
a future set.)

NOTES AND CLARIFICATIONS

Breen CRM114 : Your Away Team using this disruptor to damage a planet
facility or landed ship is making a special kind of attack; thus a
leader is required and the Away Team is subject to its normal attack
restrictions. The attack automatically succeeds, causing one damage
marker from your Battle Bridge side deck (no damage is caused if you
aren't using the side deck). Cards involved in the attack are stopped
and your opponent is allowed to counter-attack there normally.

Cargo Bay : This site allows ships to earn extra card draws by making
"cargo runs" between facilities. You only get credit for Mission cards
your ship actually passes (that is, those whose span numbers you use),
and only if they occur in a direct path between the two facilities. You
may not count the same mission more than once during the same cargo
run. As specified on the site, you also may not count the starting and
ending locations (even if you fly back and forth in an attempt to
"pass" those locations).

Forced Labor Camp : This objective refers to two existing planet
locations: Cardassia IV and Ligos VII. Cardassia IV is the location of
the Rescue Prisoners mission (found randomly in Deep Space Nine starter
decks), and Ligos VII is the location of Distress Mission (found in
each Introductory Two-Player Game).
