           Fire and Substance:
           Martinson talks about Star Trek CCG

           ------------
           Bill Martinson
           Product Development
           ------------

           The questions are preceded by the handle of
           Star Trek CCG fans who provided the
           questions. All responses are by Bill
           Martinson of Decipher's Customizable Card
           Game product development group.

           From 'The Expendable Crewman' -

           1. When is the Fajo Collection going to
           come out?

                A: We have an ambitious schedule for
                the rest of this year. Our goal is to
                ship The Fajo Collection around the
                end of October and First Contact in
                November. Also, we've been working
                behindthescenes on a special Deep
                Space Nine (DS9) introductory set, and
                we have our fingers crossed that we
                just might able to ship by it the end
                of this year as well.

                Please understand that these dates are
                projections, not promises.

           2. When is First Contact going to come out?

                A: Hmmm... guess I just covered that!

           From Livingstone.t.f. -

           3. "There was recently a contest called
           "the Real Reasons For the Delays" on the
           BBS. I think this an example of the fact
           that we don't get much information as to
           what causes delays (or a least not much
           detailed information). I understand the
           delays and the reasons behind them, but
           (you saw that coming) you have had delays
           before. Why haven't you identified the
           problems resulting in delays and formulated
           strategies and plans to compensate for
           them? Or is every problem causing a delay a
           new or unavoidable one? I'd really like to
           know."

                A: Well, first I think we have to
                define what we mean by a "delay."
                There's a double-edged sword principle
                in operation: if we don't announce our
                current estimate of when a product
                will be available, it's hard for
                customers to know what products to
                expect and roughly when during the
                year they will be available. When we
                do announce estimates, the marketplace
                tends to interpret them as shipping
                dates. Thus, when we revise those
                dates, this is perceived as a delay,
                rather than as updated information
                about where we happen to be at the
                time. The truth is, we experience
                delays (unexpected problems which
                lengthen development time) and we also
                experience normal development
                processes which make it almost
                impossible to accurately predict when
                an expansion set will be finished.

                We have indeed taken many steps to
                overcome past delays, from forging a
                new and more stable relationship with
                Paramount to hiring additional people
                for the product development group and
                in almost every area of the company.
                However, as you suggest, we are
                experiencing new challenges every day
                which sometimes result in schedule
                changes. A major challenge is the huge
                volume of new art and gameplay
                elements that we are developing. The
                Fajo Collection comprises cards which
                are, on a per-card basis, more unique
                and ground-breaking than any regular
                expansion set could be, and that takes
                a lot more time than developing just
                another 18 cards for an expansion set.

                And First Contact is, well...big. It's
                adding a whole new affiliation to the
                game. And not just another
                explore-new-worlds kind of
                affiliation, but one which is
                different. Nasty. Q told Picard that
                the Borg are "unlike anything you've
                ever encountered before," and we are
                designing the Borg affiliation to live
                up to that description. Adding a new
                affiliation to the game takes a *lot*
                of work -- more than we initially
                expected. The Borg are very different
                from the affiliations you have in your
                collection right now. Different icons.
                Different skills. A different
                personnel card format. They don't cure
                plagues. They don't repair the Argus
                Array. They don't even have an
                outpost. Getting all of the details
                right is not something that can be
                done quickly.

                First Contact contains other new
                factors which have conspired to
                lengthen development time. For one, we
                are testing a few simple updates to
                the basic rules booklet that we think
                will enhance the strategy and fun
                elements of your games while also
                allowing new gameplay mechanisms to
                work properly. For another, we are
                creating a brand-new card type and new
                game themes which will have
                implications for subsequent expansion
                sets. Keep in mind that First Contact,
                as the first expansion developed under
                our new license, must be *very*
                forward-thinking. I think I've
                mentioned in earlier discussions on
                our BBS that the first thing we did
                was start developing our "four-year
                plan." That framework was essential
                before we could begin development on
                First Contact, but it was just the
                foundation. Every step of First
                Contact work requires moving that plan
                along, refining and enhancing it. The
                cards and themes in First Contact are
                intertwined (sometimes very subtly)
                with cards and themes from all of our
                other Star Trek properties, from
                Data's first encounter with Madam
                Guinan in 1893 to Voyager's current
                exploits in the Delta Quadrant. And we
                want to be sure that the cards we're
                creating right now lay the groundwork
                for those future themes in a way
                that's accurate, logical and
                especially fun!

                So we are taking a long-term view of
                the game. Instead of just "cranking
                out" 130 cards to meet our initial
                projections, we are taking the time to
                get it right. Our hope is that, six
                months or five years from now, you
                will still be enjoying the cards in
                this set, and the extra month or two
                of waiting will seem in hindsight to
                have been worth it.

           From Thomas Warwick -

           4. "Who will the 6 Skilled Rommie be?"

                A: Hmmm... I can't really answer that
                without spoiling a new gameplay
                surprise, so I hope you'll forgive me
                if I duck that question. Suffice it to
                say that it may surprise you just a
                bit."

           5. Is the Barash Icon going to take effect
           in the Fajo Collection or the next
           expansion?

                A: It won't be in First Contact. Since
                Barash is really a The Next Generation
                (TNG) concept, it will happen in a
                later expansion set.

           6. Will some DS9 personnel have Alternate
           Universe (AU) icons, and if so, will the
           Alternate Universe door be available.

                A: Lots of AU characters have been
                seen in various DS9 episodes, so I'm
                sure we'll have plenty of them in the
                game. I don't foresee a problem with
                availability of AU Doorways.

           7. Will there be a second warp pack for
           DS9?

                A: That's a possibility, although it's
                a little too far down the road for us
                to determine right now. As you might
                expect, the Fajo Collection, First
                Contact and the introductory DS9 set
                are really occupying our attention at
                this time.

           8. About how long does it take, generally,
           to make an expansion ?

                A: That depends on the expansion.
                First Contact is taking us quite a bit
                longer than planned for the reasons I
                mentioned above, but after that we
                expect to start producing expansion
                sets more frequently than we have in
                the past (we've added more people and
                better organization to the product
                development team in order to
                accomplish this goal).

                It's almost impossible to answer this
                question with a "general" number,
                because we're usually developing more
                than one expansion at a time. Also,
                it's often the case that cards
                developed for one set get "reserved"
                (held) for a future set for one reason
                or another. So we don't really have
                exact figures on how many hours or
                weeks it takes to make one expansion
                set. The best answer to your question
                I have is, "not as long as it used
                to." ;-)

           From Tomek -

           9. What is the 'tentative' timing on such
           things as:

              * Mystery Battle Expansion?
              * Deep Space Nine?
              * Voyager?

                A: Thank you for emphasizing
                "tentative." ;-) DS9 is now planned to
                be the next product to follow Fajo and
                First Contact. The DS9 introductory
                set, hoped to be available around the
                end of this year, is a lead-in product
                for a proposed 260-card full DS9
                expansion, currently planned for some
                time in the first half of next year.
                After that, probably toward the end of
                next Summer or early Fall, we have
                slated the so-called "mystery"
                expansion (which some of you have
                taken to calling "BaH", the Klingon
                word for "Fire!").

                Voyager is quite a bit further down
                the road; I think we will concentrate
                primarily on our other properties and
                give the characters and themes in
                Voyager a chance to develop more in
                order to reduce the chances of making
                cards which are later proven to be
                obsolete or incomplete.

           10. Are Deep Space Nine and Voyager going
           to be stand alone (yet compatible)
           expansions?

                A: Well, we want to eat our cake and
                have it, too. Our primary goal is to
                create a game system where everything
                works together seamlessly, while still
                creating the distinctive "feel" of the
                various Star Trek properties. The new
                cards will unquestionably be fully
                compatible with the existing ones, but
                we also want DS9 to represent an
                alternate "entry point" for fans who
                are not yet into the game. We are
                designing the DS9 introductory set to
                serve that purpose. It would introduce
                the new concepts and allow everyone to
                get essentially a "super starter set"
                which guarantees playability right out
                of the box.

           11. Some of the delays in First Contact
           were due to developing and testing totally
           new mechanics around the new Borg
           Affiliation. Which of the upcoming
           expansions are:

             A. pretty much a done deal as far as the
                game mechanics are concerned OR
             B. involve significantly new mechanics
                that need to be developed and tested

                A: Well, every expansion set will
                contain significant new gameplay
                features, because we all want to keep
                things fresh and interesting. But I
                think First Contact is a good
                candidate for requiring the largest
                amount of work to develop new
                mechanics. I can't say that any of our
                planned expansions other than the Fajo
                Collection are donedeals at this
                point, although BaH is probably
                closest to that description in the
                sense that many of its gameplay
                elements are already developed to a
                certain point.

           12. And finally the most important question
           of all - are there any plans to put out a
           Romulan Two-Player Game?

                A: Not at this time. However, if
                you're looking for cool Romulan
                premium/preview cards, I would point
                to Dr. Telek R'Mor in the Star Trek
                CCG First Anthology, and a couple of
                green cards in the Fajo Collection. I
                think they easily rival the great
                premium cards in the existing
                two-player game!

           From Puff the Magic Dragon -

           13. What are the affiliations of the DS9
           two-player game?

                A: Our current plan is Federation vs.
                Cardassian, representing the tone of
                the series when it first started. Or
                Breen vs. Miradorn -- we can't quite
                decide. ;-)

           From Trelane -

           14. Here's a question, when and how will
           Mot the Barber stuff be useful?

                A: Well, Mot and Mot's Advice are
                somewhat useful now via the
                Terraforming Station, and there's a
                card coming in First Contact which
                will enhance that rather unusual
                strategy. But if you mean the "real"
                uses of Barbering, I will say that our
                next regular TNG expansion just might
                hold a few surprises.

           15. People on the Decipher BBS have
           commented that Decipher is giving much more
           support to Star Wars than Star Trek. How do
           you respond to this?

                A: I certainly understand that
                perception, but it's not really true.
                Star Trek and Star Wars have equal
                status here, in spite of the vast
                differences in number of products
                released, player base size and
                revenues. Also, there is a lot of
                stuff going on behind the scenes
                that's not really visible to the
                players. When our new license became a
                reality, then tournament support,
                extra expansion sets, and other
                support became priorities again, but
                it takes time to get them up and
                running.

                Also, if you look at it from a
                per-card, per-player or per-revenue
                basis, we are actually expending a lot
                *more* resources on Star Trek than
                Star Wars.

           16. How much expansion will there be for
           Q-Continuum cards and Alternate Universe
           Icon cards in upcoming expansion sets?

                A: Lots! Even under our old license we
                had always intended to add new cards
                to both of these themes. Our new
                license just gives us that much more
                material to draw from, since we've
                seen plenty of Q- and AU-related
                themes in both Deep Space Nine and
                Voyager.

           From Col. Roberta Hogan -

           17. Does anybody know when and if a Star
           Trek CCG Palace ever will be?

                A: Yes, we have developed a Star Trek
                Palace, but we are awaiting approval
                from Paramount before we can go live.

           From Phalanx -

           18. When will we be able to order Fajo?

                A: Fajo will be sold exclusively by a
                company called The Eccentric Order. We
                expect that they will begin accepting
                orders in September. We will provide
                all of the necessary product
                information on our web site, along
                with links to The Eccentric Order web
                site, where you will be able to place
                your order on-line or obtain a
                toll-free number (where applicable)
                for telephone orders. Also,
                advertisements in all the major trade
                publications will provide the same
                information.

           19. Will the Borg rules be released in Fajo
           or the First Contact expansion?

                A: First Contact. Fajo will have a
                rules sheet describing the cool,
                powerful and even humorous gameplay
                features of the Fajo cards, but the
                full dossier on the Borg will appear
                in First Contact.

           20. If these or future expansions make
           cards obsolete/useless, what will be done
           about that?

                A: On the contrary, our goal with
                future expansions is to make existing
                cards *more* useful. Granted, we
                sometimes make mistakes, and when that
                happens we will correct them. But I
                think you'll see that new cards in
                both Fajo and First Contact will give
                some of your old "binder fodder" new
                life! For example, I hope you have a
                few shuttlecraft where you can get to
                them...

           21. Can the delays that have plagued
           previous expansions be avoided in the
           future? If so, how?

                A: Yes. Many of the delays were
                systemic problems inherent in the way
                our license was handled, and these
                have been addressed by the way our new
                license is structured. Other steps
                we're taking include additional
                employees, better internal
                organization and more focused product
                development sub-teams. Please
                understand that it will take time for
                you to see the fruit of these changes,
                but we're confident that you will see
                it.

           22. An earlier question asked if anything
           would be done to eliminate Borg-hunting,
           outpost, and other non-mission decks. Did
           Decipher foresee that these decks might be
           made?

                A: No, I don't think we foresaw
                non-mission decks as being as popular
                as they currently seem to be.

           23. Does Decipher approve of non-mission
           decks, or are they considered to be
           problems to be removed?

                A: Actually, somewhere in between. We
                would like to discourage those kinds
                of decks from dominating gameplay,
                without totally removing the ability
                to try one once in awhile. I think
                making non-mission decks riskier is a
                good approach. For example, once First
                Contact cards begin to find their way
                into decks, your Borg-hunting
                opponents may get more than they
                bargained for, as they sometimes find
                that the hunter has become the
                hunted....

           From Alidar Jarok -

           24. The battle expansion - is there any
           theme that we can expect? I assume that we
           won't see powerful ships making up half the
           cards. Also, will we see Cardassian/Ferengi
           stuff? If so, in what way? Will we see a
           Cardassian icon on a mission or two? Or a
           few Ferengi or Borg personnel?

                A: It's probably too early to answer
                most of these questions, although I
                will say you are correct that it won't
                just be an expansion full of big, bad
                ships. There will be a few new ships,
                to be sure, but I would expect them to
                be more on the order of new and
                unusual, rather than just big boats
                with big numbers.

           25. The DS9 Premiere set - will it be a
           large set (363 cards or so) like the
           original TNG set? If it is going to be
           stand-alone, how will you handle AU
           personnel? Will you add AU Doors in the set
           or will you think of a new way to report AU
           personnel?

                A: Again, this is getting a bit ahead
                of where we are now, but our current
                plan is to follow the introductory DS9
                product with a "double" 260-card
                expansion set. As for AU personnel, I
                don't think we will reprint the
                Alternate Universe Door in a DS9
                expansion. Since it is a common card
                and the Alternate Universe expansion
                set is not yet sold out, we don't need
                to worry about availability just yet.
                If and when the supply of AU Doors
                becomes an issue, we will do whatever
                is necessary to ensure that all
                players can report their AU icon cards
                for duty.

           26. How will you handle the Romulans in DS9
           and Voyager? I have recently reviewed the
           tapes, and I have seen only a few Romulans
           in DS9 - one in "The Search", 4 in
           "Visionary", and about 10 in "The Die Is
           Cast". And I believe that R'Mor was the
           only Romulan in Voyager. In that case, what
           will happen to Klingons, Romulans,
           Cardassians, etc., in Voyager? Will they
           end?

                A: Not in this game! We currently plan
                to keep creating new cards for all
                affiliations as we go along (so First
                Contact is not the last you will see
                of Borg cards).

                Also, there are more ways to enhance
                an affiliation than just making cards
                of the characters seen on TV. There
                are *plenty* of Klingons and
                Cardassians yet to be made, and we
                have a couple of tricks up our sleeves
                for helping the Romulans to "keep up"
                with the other affiliations. We have
                the option of making new unseen
                Romulans, as was done for Mogh and
                Ja'rod in the two-player game, and we
                also have a couple of "official"
                images of Romulans that you've never
                seen (or just *think* you've never
                seen). ;-)

           27. I understand that there will be at
           least one more movie before the end of your
           4-year deal (which, I hope, will be
           extended). Do you think that you will get
           info on the movie while it is being filmed
           so you can plan your set and get it out
           shortly after the movie is released?

                A: I'm not really involved in that
                aspect of our license agreement, but I
                would expect that such advance
                information would be available.

           28. Will there be TNG expansions after the
           DS9 set comes out (your best guess, of
           course)?

                A: My best guess: Yes. There are a lot
                of cool concepts left in TNG that are
                just begging to be put on cards. (When
                I doze off too close to the video
                tapes, I hear them in my sleep:
                "Please, please... make me into a
                card, I would be a great dilemma....)

           29. Is the Yeager/Steamrunner/Akira
           starship thing finalized with Paramount?

                A: No. Paramount has been unable to
                provide information on those ships,
                and it appears that ILM did most of
                that development work. If we can
                obtain solid information from
                Paramount, we will develop those ships
                for a future expansion set.

           From 'Big Mama Horta' -

           30. Decipher must have been well into the
           planning and development of 'Holodeck
           Adventures' and 'All Good Things' before
           the new contract. Is there any prospect of
           these being completed and brought out
           before the expiration of this current
           contract?

                A: Having four (at a minimum)
                properties to draw from meant that we
                needed to go back and re-evaluate our
                overall plan, especially in order to
                determine which themes and concepts
                would make the best additions to
                gameplay as a whole. There is
                certainly the possibility that at
                least one of those sets could still
                appear, but our Orb of Time is on the
                fritz right now and we really can't
                see far enough into the future to be
                sure if and when they might be
                re-scheduled.

           From Jono -

           31. Is the Fajo Collection's main delay
           been the revamping of the Borg affiliation
           for the First Contact expansion because
           this directly affects Locutus of Borg in
           Fajo?

                A: Yes, that's definitely been a major
                factor. The Borg as a whole have been
                through a couple of pretty major
                revisions, and Locutus has been
                revised right along with them. I wish
                we could have had the Fajo Collection
                out sooner, but I'm very glad that we
                waited. The Locutus we had on the
                board just a few months ago would not
                have meshed well with the affiliation
                as it exists now, but our current
                Locutus of Borg card is right in line
                with the rest of the Borg affiliation.

           32. It is well known with the Anthology
           that two new affiliations will premiere in
           DS9. I know that this is premature (but I'm
           curious), Dominion affiliation is almost
           certain to appear. My question: is
           Decipher's plan for DS9 to release a
           two-player set and a stand-alone expansion
           (great for Star Trek CCG newbies and
           old-timers alike) and wait to include the
           Dominion as an expansion later so that the
           first products of DS9 only focus on
           Cardassians, Ferengi and in smaller amounts
           the existing affiliation (since really the
           Dominion didn't appear until the second
           year of DS9).

                A: Great minds think alike. Our
                current plan is definitely to approach
                Deep Space Nine from a chronological
                point of view. This means first
                dealing with the Federation/Cardassian
                tension surrounding the newly acquired
                (and badly damaged) Terok Nor/DS9.

           33. Is Decipher going to make (or let
           another publisher handle) a revised or 2nd
           edition Player's Guide since Brady probably
           would not be interested in doing another
           one.

                A: Unlike our original license
                (wherein Brady, a division of
                Paramount, was a third-party licensee
                of Paramount and Decipher), the new
                agreement with Paramount grants to
                Decipher the exclusive right to
                develop and market a strategy guide.
                Whether we will do so remains to be
                seen; I guess it depends on whether
                the market seems to prefer us spending
                product development resources on
                support projects such as this or on
                developing additional cards.

           34. Have the design team picked out the
           colors for the Ferengi affiliation yet? (A
           yes or no answer will do).

                A: Yes. Our plan for the Ferengi cards
                will be visually compatible with the
                icon already seen on Quark Son of
                Keldar.

           35. Since Fajo is going to be tournament
           legal and include die-cut cards...how might
           this affect play since die-cut cards are
           easily 'marked' when in play?

                A: Although the Fajo cards do have
                special production processes, there
                are no special die cuts that would
                "mark" them or affect gameplay --
                tournament or otherwise.

           36. Is Decipher going to start to include
           expansion symbols on the cards like Star
           Wars CCG since we can expect more than one
           expansion per year?

                A: We've been considering that, but
                haven't made a final decision.

           37. How is the relationship with
           Paramount/Viacom been recently?

                A: Excellent! We're still trying to
                get some resources, but it's a long
                process and the relationship is
                working well.

           38. How much input do fans have on the
           creation of cards? (i.e. cards submitted to
           Decipher, etc...)

                A: Quite a bit. Anything which is of
                importance to even a portion of the
                player base gets our attention, and
                helps us create better gameplay.

           39. Do you get any sleep? ;)

                A: Sleep? What's that? ;-)

           From Jadon -

           40. I'm dreaming of a Cardassian Christmas.
           Is there any chance of seeing DS9 before
           1998? AND how will it be packaged? In 60
           card boxes? expansion packs?

                A: I doubt that anyone celebrates
                Christmas on Cardassia Prime. ;-)

                As I mentioned above, we're trying to
                develop some DS9 cards in time for
                Christmas. I would guess, however,
                that the full 260-card DS9 expansion
                won't be packaged in 60-card starter
                decks. The proposed introductory set
                will fulfill the same need, and in a
                better way I think, since you'll know
                you're getting one or two playable
                decks and you only have to buy one
                copy.

           41. Just how are those doggone Borg going
           to work?

                A: Relentlessly, for the most part.
                ;-) They will operate differently from
                your other affiliations, that's for
                sure. As I hinted at above, they don't
                go around having diplomatic
                conferences on Parliament. They
                assimilate, eliminate, eradicate. They
                take over entire planets. They steal
                your technology. And they don't even
                say "sorry."

           From Brent Mair -

           42. Can we expect to see new
           classifications & skills? I'm *really*
           hoping to see some MERCHANT Ferengi's.

                A: We're trying not to go overboard
                with new classifications, but new
                skills will definitely be in the mix.
                As for merchants, I think your hopes
                will not be in vain...

           43. Are there any new Doorways? Can you
           tell us how time travel is involved? How do
           the Borg score points?

                A: Yes! I love Doorway cards, and I
                think there's a good chance that First
                Contact will contain more Doorway
                cards than any previous set. As for
                time travel, I can't really tell you
                much right now, other than to say that
                it will be somewhat more detailed than
                Temporal Rifts and Devidian Doors. And
                as for the Borg scoring points,
                remember the Queen telling Data that
                the Borg are on a quest to better
                themselves? They seek perfection. Only
                the pursuit of perfection (as they see
                it) matters to the Borg.

           From Kahless -

           44. Are there any plans to make an
           effective Fajo counter (that doesn't
           totally ruin the card but will hinder those
           decks with 5+ Kivas'?)

                A: Yes. You'll see it in First
                Contact.

           45. Are there any plans to make an
           effective counter for counters themselves?
           That's another deck strategy that I,
           personally, find to be very abusive and
           counter to the spirit of the game, and I'd
           like to know if there are any plans to
           create something similar to Star Wars CCG's
           "Do or Do Not" in terms of hampering
           counters?

                A: Yes again. We have a couple of
                cards in First Contact which help
                against over-use of duplicate cards
                and having too many cards in your
                hand. Both of these cards could be
                effective against a deck that's heavy
                with Kevins and Amandas. Also, we have
                in the works a more focused "counter
                counter" which will probably appear in
                a later expansion set.

           From Mike Palazzolo (aka Shadow) -

           46. Could we have more info, more details
           on the Time Travel and Battle Enhancing
           elements that we've heard will be coming
           with First Contact and the Battle
           expansion? Whether or not you use these
           questions, thank you for asking us fans
           what questions we wanted asked.

                A: Our pleasure; thank you for
                responding! Unfortunately, I can't say
                much about time travel and battling,
                except to say that they will both get
                a lot more interesting. Our plan is to
                really create the "feel" of time
                travel and ship-to-ship battle in Star
                Trek, while at the same time providing
                new strategic possibilities for your
                deck designs. In particular, ship
                battles will become much more
                unpredictable, and there will be more
                variety to what it means to be
                "damaged." Transporters inoperable,
                casualties on the bridge... it's not a
                safe galaxy out there.

           From Haakona Maht-H'a ta -

           47. Decipher, and especially the PD
           department, have recently been under a lot
           of fire from the fans about the delays. Has
           this had any affect on the morale of either
           group?

                A: We always care what the fans think,
                and we try to correct problems as best
                we can. But we don't really let the
                negativity affect our morale. As
                players ourselves, we understand the
                frustration and we want to respond to
                it. When you enjoy a game this much,
                it's hard to be patient for the next
                expansion set!

                There has always been and will always
                be a certain amount of negativity in
                any arena where the fans feel so
                passionately about the subject matter.
                But there are so many reasons for us
                to feel positive: Star Trek is a
                wonderful property to base a game on;
                most of our fans are very supportive;
                Decipher is a tremendously creative
                and positive place to work; the cards
                we're creating right now are very
                exciting and fun to develop and play
                test; and the list goes on. Sure, we
                can feel somewhat frustrated when we
                aren't able to meet every one of our
                players' expectations, or when there's
                an unbalanced player focus on
                negatives rather than positives. But
                this is a *great* place to be.

           48. Does the advent of a new gameplay
           mechanism for the Borg (the whole they
           don't do missions thing) going to provide a
           different direction for some Star Trek CCG
           decks? If so, does this mark a slight
           endorsement of the current popular style of
           deck which gains more than half of it's
           points from non-mission sources?

                A: I don't think so. We've developed a
                model for the Borg where they don't
                really attempt missions, but in such a
                way that the opponent's dilemmas and
                other seed cards are *not* ignored.
                One of the things we want to do is
                preserve the value of the cards you
                choose to put into your deck -- even
                when you're playing a Borg opponent.

           49. Although this is a wee bit off-topic...
           Does Decipher has any plans in order to get
           more stores to carry their Star Trek CCG
           product?

                A: Yes! That's one of the reasons
                we've hired Marcus Certa as the Star
                Trek Emissary. His mission is to be
                the product champion for Star Trek
                CCG, to expand the player base, expand
                our retailer support, and generally
                increase the visibility and
                availability of this great game. You
                can read more about this new ally in
                the NewsFlash.

from Deciphers Web-Site:

    Warren Holland, Chairman & CEO Of Decipher
    Announces Great Star Trek Customizable Card
    Game News

    ------------
    Warren Holland
    Chairman and CEO
    ------------

    Since our groundbreaking license with
    Paramount the end of November, we have been
    very busy behind the scenes planning the
    entire Star Trek[TM] Customizable Card
    Game[TM] line for the next four years. I
    realize we have released very little news
    mostly because the expanded license brought
    so many new dynamics to our plans. There is
    so much work going on at once, that our
    schedules are changing almost daily. Have
    no fear... Star Trek is getting a
    tremendous amount of attention at Decipher.

    Decipher and Paramount have been working
    together, diligently gathering new
    resources for First Contact[TM], Deep Space
    Nine[TM], Voyager[TM] and The Next
    Generation[TM]. An enormous amount of work
    is taking place on new cards, distribution,
    marketing, tournaments and other
    enhancements to the game. You are about to
    benefit from the fruits of this labor. ;-)

    I know one product everyone wants to know
    about is The Fajo Collection[TM].
    Sooooooo... I decided it was time I gave
    you a sneak peek at what's in store for
    this revolutionary product. Before I do, I
    thought I would give you an overview of
    what's coming for the Star Trek
    Customizable Card Game as a whole. The
    following represents product for one year
    of our license. As you read, keep in mind
    that under the previous license with
    Paramount, only one expansion set a year
    was introduced. ;-)

    You have already seen the Introductory
    Two-Player Games. In 1997, the flood gates
    will open...

    * The First Anthology - will be released
      in May. This wonderful product is
      packed with value and features, among
      other things, six rare white-border
      "preview cards" from upcoming DS9 and
      Voyager expansions. It also contains a
      $10 coupon off the price of The Fajo
      Collection, plus a very cool Star Trek
      Customizable Card Game 800-card
      storage box.

    * The Fajo Collection - Mid-year we have
      an innovative, limited-edition,
      special expansion set that will be
      sold directly by a new Decipher
      subsidiary. Think of this as The
      Franklin Mint of the collectible card
      game industry. The Fajo Collection is
      designed to "break new ground and blow
      your mind." I will tell you more about
      this exciting product below.

    * First Contact expansion set -In the
      third quarter we will introduce THE
      BORG in an exciting expansion which I
      expect will bring an enormous amount
      of attention to this game.

    * A mystery expansion set -In the fourth
      quarter, we originally planned to
      introduce an expansion set called
      Holodeck Adventures. No longer. We
      have decided instead to push forward
      another expansion that has been in
      development. This as yet unnamed set
      will introduce a totally new gameplay
      mechanism to the Star Trek
      Customizable Card Game... enhanced
      battling! This is the most requested
      gameplay element from players, and
      that's what we're going to deliver.
      Very, very exciting. (Of course,
      playing this system is optional.) Not
      only will battling be more pervasive,
      it will be more exhilarating and
      unpredictable!

    * Deep Space Nine -In late 1997 or early
      1998, we expect to introduce the first
      DS9 product which will provide "a new
      entry point" into our game, yet the
      cards will be 100% compatible with all
      cards in the Star Trek Customizable
      Card Game universe.

    * Uncut sheets - Both limited edition
      black-border and unlimited edition
      white-border unframed, uncut sheets
      will be offered. These items are truly
      works of art. We anticipate a
      three-sheet set of white-border
      Premiere (a common, uncommon and rare)
      will sell for about $100, plus
      shipping and handling. The Fajo
      Collection will include a 50% discount
      coupon making a set of three uncut
      sheets cost far less than many fine
      art posters. That's an amazing value.
      Black-border limited edition uncut
      sheets are designed for very serious
      collectors. The sets will be extremely
      rare... only 500 Premiere black-border
      sets will ever be offered to the
      public worldwide. Expect a high price,
      something on the order of a complete
      black-border set of cards. These
      sheets will be signed, numbered and
      include a certificate of authenticity.
      These unique products are sure to
      spark excitement with die-hard Star
      Trek fans!

    * Foreign language sets - Also at the
      end of 1997 or early 1998, we expect
      to introduce the first foreign
      language versions of Star Trek
      Customizable Card Game.

    There's more! Our Star Trek Customizable
    Card Game tournament structure is nearing
    completion. It will include sanctioned
    tournaments, junior tournaments and
    sanctioned sealed deck tournaments.
    Decipher has developed a proprietary
    software tool exclusively for tournament
    directors to assist them in running
    tournaments efficiently, and to report
    tournament results quickly for a "worldwide
    player ranking system." I'm also happy to
    announce that we are hot at work on Palace,
    our Star Trek Customizable Card Game
    graphic chat area for our web site. We
    introduced this feature for Star Wars
    Customizable Card Game a few months ago to
    resounding applause. I must say, this
    project will arrive a bit earlier that we
    originally expected. Our Star Trek CCG
    Palace is quite impressive and very, very
    cool.

    Whewwwwwww. So, there you have it... an
    overview. That's a lot, don't you think?
    But, I have something else to share with
    you... The Fajo Collection.

    Until his arrest in 2366, Kivas Fajo
    ambitiously collected the greatest
    artifacts in the galaxy-by any means
    possible.

    I am very pleased to announce a special
    Star Trek Customizable Card Game portfolio
    named after this unique character and his
    fanatical pursuit of one-of-a-kind objects.
    Thankfully, you don't have to stoop to
    Kivas' unscrupulous level when acquiring
    the best. Our exclusive collection will be
    printed in a numbered, limited edition of
    40,000 sets, approximately the same as the
    number of ultra-rare Future Enterprise
    cards printed.

    You have never seen anything like The Fajo
    Collection. Think of it as an item you
    would expect from The Franklin Mint or
    Sharper Image... exceptional, valuable and
    innovative. Decipher has crafted eighteen
    super-rare cards containing some of the
    most innovative features and gameplay to
    ever appear in a collectible card game. The
    cards arrive in a presentation binder
    housed in a protective slip cover case
    (like fine books).

    I've heard rumors that The Fajo Collection
    will contain nothing but artifacts...
    that's NOT correct. You will find
    long-anticipated personnel cards as well as
    artifacts, ships and a wide variety of
    other card types. Powerful. Beautiful.
    Highly desirable cards. A number of cards
    are manufactured using unique printing
    techniques and arguably have some of the
    most dynamic art ever to emerge from
    Decipher's design studio.

    I won't reveal all the secrets, but here's
    a sample of the excitement...

    * 1962 Roger Maris Baseball Card - an
      artifact based upon the episode "The
      Most Toys," which featured Kivas Fajo
      himself. Ever since a prototype of
      this card was shown at GenCon, it has
      been rumored that it would appear in
      The Fajo Collection. Okay, okay... I
      confirm that it will. Not only is the
      gameplay of this Artifact
      extraordinary, but the card arrives in
      your hands... with "the original
      bubble gum smell." Too cool! Ohhhhh...
      don't worry, the card will not smell
      like bubble gum when you put it in
      your deck. ;-)

    * DNA Metamorphosis - a planet/space
      dilemma based upon the episode
      "Identity Crisis." In this show,
      Geordi has a five year old dormant
      infection that activates, rewriting
      his DNA and compelling him to return
      to Tarchannen III. There Geordi is
      transformed into an invisible
      reptilian humanoid observable only
      when examined under ultraviolet light.
      Decipher's artists have re-created
      this special effect by printing
      sections of this card with special
      luminous inks. Awesome!

    * Qapla'! - an Interrupt card. Sooooo,
      it's an interrupt card. What's so
      special? Well, actually it's a qaghwI'
      written entirely in the Klingon
      language. Wow... I hear Klingon fans
      going nuts. haha

    We haven't forgotten our Romulan fans
    either (they sometimes feel left out, but I
    believe they get their revenge in this
    set). Two cards in particular will thrill a
    Romulan lover beyond belief. For example,
    can you say, "Mindmeld?" Also, the set
    includes two powerful alternate universe
    ships that are linked in a rather unusual
    way. Actually, every card in this portfolio
    is a treasure. How much of a treasure?
    Well, I've mentioned a few examples, but
    I'll reveal two more (and that's all.
    hahaha)... two of the most sought after
    personnel cards every created... Guinan and
    Locutus of Borg.

    Guinan!

    Locutus of Borg!

    Wow! Yes, the favorite bartender on the
    Enterprise and the Big Borg Man himself
    will appear in this special set. ;-) We
    have no idea what these cards will go for
    on the singles market. What would you pay
    for Guinan? $20? $30? or Locutus of Borg?
    $30? $40? Your guess is as good as ours.

    Each portfolio will contain the same
    eighteen cards (The Fajo Collection is not
    randomized). Every card in The Collection
    has at least one feature you have never
    seen before, and each card breaks new
    ground in terms of gameplay and "cool
    factor." ;-) Also, all eighteen cards are
    tournament playable.

    The Fajo Collection contains a certificate
    of authenticity bearing the signatures of
    key members of Decipher's product
    development and art teams, a collectible
    art poster showcasing the entire Star Trek
    Collectible Card Game universe, a
    Proof-of-Purchase certificate good for up
    to $30 in rebates from purchases of the
    First Anthology (up to three $10 coupons
    can be used), a rules supplement covering
    new gameplay innovations in The Fajo
    Collection cards and a special 50% discount
    offer on the first white-border uncut
    sheets ever sold to the general public from
    the Premiere edition of Star Trek: The Next
    Generation Customizable Card Game. This
    discount offer is valued at $50. Expect The
    Fajo Collection to cost about $80, plus
    shipping and handling.

    The Fajo Collection will be sold directly
    and exclusively by a new Decipher
    subsidiary. Purchases will be limited to 4
    sets per household. Although it is not
    being sold at wholesale, retailers and
    distributors will also be able to purchase
    up to four sets (we expect primarily for
    singles sales). Now... I know... the next
    question is... "When will it ship?" I
    mentioned a projected date earlier in this
    letter, but I'm not prepared to announce an
    official release date as of yet. The
    enormity of our new Star Trek license
    required that we redesign a few cards. For
    example, when First Contact (the movie) was
    released, it had an impact on the icons and
    design of Locutus of Borg.

    Further information on the release date and
    ordering instructions for The Fajo
    Collection will be appearing on Decipher's
    web site at www.decipher.com, and in ads of
    respected industry publications such as
    Scrye and Inquest.

    I'm pleased to have shared some of our
    plans with you. The Star Trek Customizable
    Card Game has a very bright future.
    Decipher views The Fajo Collection as a
    special celebration of this wonderful game.
    Our designers and artists have crafted a
    masterpiece!

    Once again, I welcome you to a universe
    with endless possibilities!

from Deciphers Web-Site:

    With a brand new century opening up ahead of it, the Star Trek
    Customizable Card Game is preparing to boldly go where no CCG has gone
    before - and to take its fans along for the adventure. We have a truly
    packed year planned for Star Trek CCG players and collectors, and it
    starts right here...

    Releasing in March 2000, the Second Anthology will
    offer a retrospective of the last few years of
    Star Trek CCG history. Packaged in a beautiful and
    sturdy 800-card-capacity storage box, the Second
    Anthology will contain 6 new black-bordered
    premium cards not available anywhere else, 2
    copies of Starter Deck II, 2 expansion packs from
    the First Contact set, 2 expansion packs from the
    Deep Space Nine set and two expansion packs from
    the Dominion set. The First Contact set has been
    out of print for more than a year now, but
    Decipher had put some of it aside for special
    products such as the Second Anthology.

    In June 2000, Star Trek CCG enthusiasts will be
    treated to The Trouble With Tribbles, the game's
    first major expansion set of the century - and the
    first set to include material from the original
    Star Trek series (yes, the famous Captain Kirk made
    a randomly scheduled guest appearance in the
    Dominion set, but he's about to become part of the
    permanent crew). This set will contain a total of
    131 cards, one of which will be an ultra-rare. A
    new entry point into Star Trek CCG, The Trouble
    With Tribbles will be packaged in two different
    preconstructed starter decks as well as the
    traditional expansion packs. One deck will be
    designed for the Federation affiliation, while the
    other will be awaiting Klingon players. Each of
    these two decks will be ready to play right out of
    the box and will include two randomly selected rare
    cards from the Trouble With Tribbles set as well as
    a special premium card. The set will feature plenty
    of classic Star Trek material from the Deep Space
    Nine episode "Trials & Tribble-ations" as well as
    elements from other Star Trek properties such as
    Deep Space Nine and The Next Generation.
    Through a new game mechanic, players will be able to
    "collect" Tribbles and potentially use an unlimited number
    of the furry little critters in their decks. 1-Tribble
    cards, 5-Tribbles cards, 100-Tribbles cards...

    Scheduled for release in July 2000, the Reflections set for Star Trek
    CCG will be out just in time for the shiny summer season. This product
    will be presented in a format similar to that of the Star Wars CCG
    Reflections set, with a hefty selection of foil versions of the most
    popular Star Trek CCG rare cards. Each $5 pack will contain one foil
    card along with 17 other cards chosen at random. This means that while
    the average pack will be composed of a mix of common, uncommon and rare
    cards, you could conceivably open a pack containing 17 commons - or 17
    rares. Current components for the random mix include cards from the
    following sets: Premiere, Alternate Universe, Q-Continuum, First
    Contact, Deep Space Nine and The Dominion.

    The next major expansion set,
    releasing in September 2000, will be
    Mirror, Mirror. This set will contain
    131 cards, including an ultra-rare.
    In addition to expansion packs, the
    cards will be packaged in two
    preconstructed starter decks,
    following a format similar to the one
    used for The Trouble With Tribbles.
    Material from the original Star Trek
    series will compose a large part of
    Mirror, Mirror, with other Star Trek
    properties being featured in the set
    as well, including several Alternate
    Universe-related elements. An
    exciting new game mechanic will allow
    players to go into the mirror
    universe and come out again (and
    vice-versa), hoping to find their
    native side of the looking glass like
    they remember it.

    Enhanced Premiere, set for a November 2000 release, will conclude this
    year's list of additions to the Star Trek CCG game universe. Just enough
    time for players to enjoy a relaxed holiday season before embarking on a
    new wild ride for 2001.
