    In June 2000, Star Trek CCG enthusiasts will be
    treated to The Trouble With Tribbles, the game's
    first major expansion set of the century - and the
    first set to include material from the original
    Star Trek series (yes, the famous Captain Kirk made
    a randomly scheduled guest appearance in the
    Dominion set, but he's about to become part of the
    permanent crew). This set will contain a total of
    131 cards, one of which will be an ultra-rare. A
    new entry point into Star Trek CCG, The Trouble
    With Tribbles will be packaged in two different
    preconstructed starter decks as well as the
    traditional expansion packs. One deck will be
    designed for the Federation affiliation, while the
    other will be awaiting Klingon players. Each of
    these two decks will be ready to play right out of
    the box and will include two randomly selected rare
    cards from the Trouble With Tribbles set as well as
    a special premium card. The set will feature plenty
    of classic Star Trek material from the Deep Space
    Nine episode "Trials & Tribble-ations" as well as
    elements from other Star Trek properties such as
    Deep Space Nine and The Next Generation.
    Through a new game mechanic, players will be able to
    "collect" Tribbles and potentially use an unlimited number
    of the furry little critters in their decks. 1-Tribble
    cards, 5-Tribbles cards, 100-Tribbles cards...
