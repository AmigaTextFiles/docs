The only way to play a Transwarp Network Gateway at the
Delta Quadrant outpost is by using its special download icon, since the
Borg Outpost is not a "spaceline" location (which is required for normal
play of the Gateway).

See @{"Borg" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/BORG"} for interim rules for use of the Borg outpost.

    From the @{"Glossary" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/MAIN"}:

The sentence "A Nor may coexist here" overrides the normal rule that you
may not establish more than one facility at a location. The word "Nor" is
a reference to the type of station (and thus allows Deep Space 9 or Terok
Nor to seed there), not to the card named "Nor." That station may not be
established at a Bajor region location.
