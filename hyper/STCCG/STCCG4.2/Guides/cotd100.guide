Habib's STCCG card of the day #1

Welcome to the first installment of Habib's Card of the Day.

I thought it would be appropriate to start out with the captain of the
@{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3} ...

    @{b}JEAN-LUC PICARD@{ub}

    Federation personnel
    Officer
    Command ability

@{i}"Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the U.S.S Enterprise. Born in
LaBarre, France. Has an artificial heart. Reads Shakespeare.
Something of a Renaissance man."@{ui}

    Diplomacy x2  Leadership  Honor
    Archaeology   Navigation  Music

    Integrity 9   Cunning 8   Strength 6


Basically if you use a federation deck you should have this card. If
used with @{"Vash" link COTD88} or Richard Galen you can easily beat the @{"Hunt for DNA Program" link COTD62}
for 55 points.

He can get through @{"Q-Nets" link COTD86} with no trouble.

Wormhole Negotiations is also easy with Picard in your deck. So if you
use feds and you have a Picard, use it.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #2

Welcome to my second installment of Habib's card of the Day. Today I will
take the pleasure of reviewing my personal favorite card ...

    @{b}THE BORG SHIP@{ub}
    Dilemma (Space)

@{i}"Gigantic cubic ship of the Borg collective. Possesses powerful
weapons and remarkable regenerative abilities."@{ui}

Self-controlling ship (WEAPONS=24, SHIELDS=24). Start here.  Attacks
everything. End of turn, moves 1 card toward and off spaceline's long
end. Destroy for bonus.  45

Basically I think this is the best dilemma card in the game. It will
almost always destroy or at least damage your ship, unless you have
@{"Nutational" link COTD40} or @{"Metaphasic shields" link COTD40} and tons of personnel to power them
up. And it keeps moving for further destruction.

In combination with @{"Q-Nets" link COTD86} you can lock the Borg on an opponent's
outpost, destroying all ships that come in to play. Then with a single
Supernova you can destroy the Borg for 45 points and destroy the
opponent's outpost.

Also you can @{"wormhole" link COTD8} an opponent on to the Borg ship once it's in play,
destroying his ship and all people on board (unless he has an @{"Escape Pod" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD280"}).
So basically if you have a Borg ship, use it.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #3

Welcome to my daily posting of Habib's Card of the Day. Today's card is
one that we all know and love.

    @{b}U.S.S Enterprise@{ub}
    Galaxy Class
    Federation Ship

@{i}"The fifth Starfleet ship named Enterprise, launched in 2363. Built
at the Utopia Planetia shipyards orbiting Mars.@{ui}

    Holodeck, Tractor Beam

crew requirements: 1 large star, 2 small stars

RANGE 9  WEAPONS 8  SHIELDS 9

This could be considered the best ship in the game. It has lots of
range and lots of shields.  Gun power is it's only weakness but feds
don't usually attack anyway. However, with a combination of
@{"Bynars Weapon Enhancement" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD197"}, @{"Metaphasic" link COTD40} and @{"Nutational shields" link COTD40}, and
@{"Roga Danar" link COTD18}, the once peaceful Enterprise can be transformed into the
ultimate attack vehicle.  When it is powered up this much it can
basically mow down an enemy fleet in no time.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #4

Greetings fellow ST:CCG fans and welcome to another exciting edition of...

HABIB'S CARD OF THE DAY

Today we will look at a card we all know and love...

    @{b}THE TRAVELER: TRANSCENDENCE@{ub}
    Event

@{i}"Benevolent humanoid from Tau Alpha C who could transcend space
and time with thought."@{ui}

Place beside any player's draw deck. That player must draw on extra
card at the end of each turn. Also, while in play, nullifies
Static Warp Bubble. (Not cumulative.)

This is a great card to get out early.  First of all it nullifies the
always annoying Static Warp Bubble.  Also it lets you draw two cards
every turn.  So if it's early in the game it lets you get cards out
faster allowing you to get a good head start on your opponent.

Usually if you can get this card in your opening hand you have a
great chance of winning.  Also in combination with Red Alert you can
get two cards on one turn and play them both on the next.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

Habib's STCCG card of the day #5

Hello again,

Today's card is a Klingon officer and a neccessity in any Klingon deck.

    @{b}GOWRON@{ub}
    Klingon personnel
    V.I.P
    large star

@{i}"Son of M'Rel. Leader of the Klingon High Coucil after defeating
the Duras forces in the Klingon Civil War of 2367-68."@{ui}

    Leadership x2   Diplomacy   Honor
    INTEGRITY 8   CUNNING  7   STRENGTH 9

Basically this is a great Klingon personnel card. He has leadership to
fight and diplomacy to get through those nasty Q-Nets.

As klingons go I think that Gowron should be used in all klingon decks.
Also because of the lack of really good officers like the federation has,
Gowron is one of the best Klingon personnel out there. He is good in any
mission that needs honor and the diplomacy is rather helpful in doing
other missions. Wormhole Negotiations is a good mission in a Klingon deck
because of the ease of 4 honor. Gowron can contribute to this. Also he
has a rather high integriy level for a klingon.

@{u}Card Rating@{uu} (1=worst  10=best)

Gowron=8

Please send in requests for future card of the day entries. Send mail to
Habib@ibm.net

Also to clear up a dispute going on from my card of the day #3, the
@{"USS Enterprise" link COTD3}, I just suggested that you COULD consider the
@{"Enterprise" link COTD3} the best ship in the game. The Husnock is higher in
numbers but the @{"Enterprise" link COTD3} is more evenly distributed. I
personally think it is the best ship in the game but that is just me. I
have nothing against other ships. You have the right to form your own
oppinion.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #6

Greetings fellow ST:CCG fans and welcome to another exciting edition of Habib's Card of the day.  Today we look at a card that is needed in every deck. It has been considered one of the most useful cards in the game.  It is...

    @{b}RED ALERT!@{ub}
    Event

@{i}"The state of maximum crew and systems readiness aboard
starships."@{ui}

Plays on table.  Allows you to play as many Ship, Personnel,
and Equipment cards as desired each turn.

Basically this card is almost needed.  It is a great advantage
to get this card out.  If you get it in the opening draw you
are in good shape.  Now you can play this card right away and
play as many as 6 other cards on that turn.  You can get going
right away instead of having to play only one personnel a turn
and taking about 6 turns before you can actually do anything
productive.  People usually put 2 or 3 in their deck to make
sure they get them out early.  However with the new tournement
rules it only allows you to have 1 making the card less useful
because of the ease to cancel it with Kevin Uxbridge.  But
even with the new rules you should still put one in your deck,
it's one of the most useful cards there is.

starting now when I review cards I will have a second opinion
also.  Jack Dracula will also be reviewing the ST:CCG Card of

Habib's STCCG card of the day #7

Hello readers, and welcome to another exciting edition of
Habib's Card of the Day.  Today's card is a good one.  It
can be used in any deck (if you have the right card) and
he is loaded with useful skills.  That's right, it's...

    @{b}DATA@{ub}
    Federation personnel
    Officer
    command abiblity

@{i}"Lt. Commander Data is a sentient android created by
Dr. Noonien Soong. Has positronic brain. Desires to be human.
Once left his head in San Francisco."@{ui}

    Engineer   Computer skill x2   Music
    Astrophysics   Exobiology
    INTEGRITY 8   CUNNING 12   STRENGTH 12

Data is a great card.  He has some of the most useful
skills.  Engineering is nice to have, computer skill is
pretty good too.  Although he is federation, with Lore's
fingernail in play he can be used in any deck, making him
a extrememly good card to have.  I have used him in a
Romulan deck and some missions that need obscure skills
that Romulans don't usually have can be done with ease
when Data is out in play.  He is also great in missions
or dilemmas that you need lots of strength to overcome.
A combination of Data and Roga Danar can easily get
through any strength requirement.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #8

Welcome to another exciting edition of Habib's Card
of the Day.  Today we will take a look at a common
but useful card.  That's right, it's the...

    WORMHOLE
    Interrupt

@{i}"An unstable tunnel through subspace that links to locations in normal
space/time."@{ui}

Requires two wormholes.  Play one on any ship just
as it begins to move.  Play the other where the
ship immediately emerges.  Discard wormholes.

This is a good card to have in any deck.  They can
be used for quick transportation or play them on
an opponent to avoid attack or take them away from
a mission they are about to do.

If there is a @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2}
in play, you can wormhole your opponent on the
space where the @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2} is and kill the opponent
almost every time (unless he has shields raised
with Metaphasic or Nutational shields, or
Kurlan Naiskos).

Wormholes can be very useful for getting
out of trouble or just to move far on one turn.
The only disadvantage is that you need two to use
them.  So it may be a while before you can play
them.

VARIATION ON WORMHOLE RULES
You can make variations on the rules of the
wormholes.  One way is that you only need one.
This makes it much easier to use them.  Another
way is to have the wormholes stay in play for a
few turns so that many ships can use them.  Play
the two wormholes on the two spaces.  They stay
there for the turn played and the next turn.  This
allows for some strategies to backfire because it
gives your opponent an equal oppertunity to use
them.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #9

Greetings fellow ST:CCG fans and players and
welcome to another exciting edition of Habib's
Card of the Day.  I just got back from my
annual ski vacation to Vail, Colorado and
that's why I didn't post for a week.  Well now
I'm back and will write again.  This week will
be REALLY exciting because today is the start
of ARTIFACT WEEK!!!!  This week I will review
all of the artifacts.  I will start with one
of my favorites...

    @{b}BETAZOID GIFT BOX@{ub}
    Artifact

@{i}"Traditional device for presenting important gifts. Its
sculpted face comes to life boisterously presenting its
contents to the recipient."@{ui}

Immediately look through your draw deck for up
to thirty seconds and choose three cards to
place in your hand.  Reshuffle draw deck and
discard artifact.

This is a great card to have.  It lets you get
the cards you need right away.  If you have a
Palor Toff in your deck, you can take that as
one of your three cards and then you can get
another three.  To get this out fast place it
under a really easy mission and put your
outpost there.  Then you can get it fast and
get the cards you need to win out right away.
This makes for some quick wins.

One thing you can do is first be sure to have a couple of
Palor Toffs in your deck.  Use them on the gift
box a bunch of times so you have all the cards
you need to win.  With the gift box make sure
at least one of the cards is Raise the Stakes.
You can take more if you want.  Because you'll
almost win for sure anyway, you don't have to
worry about losing cards.  Play a Raise the
Stakes on your next turn.  Your opponent will
probably give up because they know they will
lose.  If they don't give up, you get a free
card (every time unless you really suck).

Habib's STCCG card of the day #10

Welcome again to Habib's Card of the Day.  This
is the second day in the always exciting
ARTIFACT WEEK.  Today's card is a great one.
It's the...

    @{b}HORGA'HN@{ub}
    Artifact

@{i}"Mysterious symbol of sexuality from the pleasure planet Risa.
To own one is to call forth its powers.  To display one is
to announce that the owner is seeking jamaharon."@{ui}

Immediately play on table.  Artifact allows you
to take double turns from now on. (Not cumulative)

This card is a good one to have.  It is good
because you now can do twice the amount of stuff
as you could do before.  Also it is not an event
and can only be cancelled by the Devil and not
Kevin Uxbridge.  This makes it so it will pretty
much stay out for the whole game.  If you have
an @{"Traveler" link COTD4} in play, it makes it so you get 4
cards on every turn.  This is good to get out
cards fast.  But be careful about your deck
getting down too low, if you don't have more
points than your opponent you are in danger of
losing.  For the most part I would use this card
in every deck.

Greetings all and welcome to posting #11 of Habib's
card of the day.  This is the third day of ARTIFACT
WEEK and today  we will look at a fun one.  It's
the...

    @{b}TOX UTHAT@{ub}

    Artifact

@{i}"Dangerous quantum phase inhibitor invented in the
future by Kal Dano who hid it in the 22nd century
for safekeeping."@{ui}

Place in hand until played on table as an event
(supernova can be played on later turn) OR as an
interrupt (prevents supernova).  Discard after use.

This is a card where you either love it or you hate
it.  It is great if you can get out a supernova but
if you can't it's pointless.  A good way to get it
out is to use a @{"Betazoid Gift Box" link COTD9}.  Once out it can
be used for many different things.  If you can get
it early, use it to destroy your opponent's outpost.
Since they won't have two engineers, they can't
bring it back, basically taking them out of the
game.

If your opponent has already gotten some
ships and stuff out, you should use it on other
things.  You can use it on the Borg Ship for
example. If you Q-Net a borg ship on an outpost,
you can take them both down at once.  If your
opponent has all their people on one ship, you
should use it on that.  It can also be used to
prevent a supernova, but to me its main purpose is
to destroy.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #12

Greetings all, and welcome to Habib's Card of the
Day.  Today is the 4th day in artifact week and
we will look at the...

    @{b}THOUGHT MAKER@{ub}

    Artifact

@{i}"Outlawed Ferengi mind control device.  Transmits
signals that implant sensory experiences and
triggers emotions and memories"@{ui}

Place in hand until played once as an Interrupt
card.  Look at opponent's draw deck for ten seconds
and rearrange as desired.

This is an okay artifact but I wouldn't say it's
terrific.  If you do decide to use it, as always
place it under an easy mission so you can get it
right away.  Once you get it, play it soon so you
can get your opponent's good cards at the bottom.

Cards that I would put at the bottom are:

@{"Red Alert!" link COTD6}
Really good personnel
The Juggler
Palor Toff
@{"Metaphasic" link COTD40} or @{"Nutational Shields" link COTD40}
Kevin Uxbridge, Amanda Rogers, and Q2
ships (especially if they don't have any out yet)

Also if you know that they rely on one strategy,
take out the cards for the strategy and they
probably won't win.

From: Habib@ibm.net

The mysterious Card of the Day #13 has been found!!!  For some reason
no one had it.  I was the last hope, but some how my COTD file
mysteriously got erased.  But after searching through my room, I
came across an old pile of COTD's that I had printed out.  Sure
enough, in that pile was #13.  So in case you missed it or you want
to add it to your file, I am posting it again.  Here it is...

Hello all and welcome to Habib's Card of the Day.  Today being the 5th
day in ARTIFACT WEEK, we look at another exciting card.

    @{b}KURLAN NAISKOS@{ub}

    Artifact

@{i}"Statues which open to reveal a multitude of similar but smaller
figurines inside, representing the belief that each person is a
community of individual voices and desires."@{ui}

Place in hand until played on any ship as an Event card.  if ship has
all 7 personnel types aboard, its RANGE, WEAPONS, and SHIELDS are all
tripled. (Not cumulative)

This is a great artifact if you can get it to work.  Once your ship
is powered up, it's almost invincible.  The problem is getting all
the people on the ship.  Romulans are probably the hardest deck to
use this card with due to the lack of VIP's and civilians.  The
non-aligned Ishara Yar can help out by being a civilian.  Also you
can use Amarie, also a non-aligned civilian but with less skills than
Ishara. If you are playing as the federation, one of my favorite
cards Mot the barber can be used as a civilian.  This is the only
good use of Mot I can find.  Klingon decks will have no trouble
getting a VIP, almost all the decent klingons have that personnel
type.  There are also a couple of klingon civilians.  The only big
problem with klingons is finding a medical crewman.

In closing, if you are sure you will be able to use this card, I'd
put it in your deck.  But if getting all the needed personnel is a
problem, I wouldn't use it.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #14

Hello all, todays card is of course another artifact.
We will now celebrate the 6th day in ARTIFACT WEEK
with...

    @{b}TIME TRAVEL POD@{ub}

    Artifact

"Craft from the future, stolen in the past by
Berlinghoff Rasmussen for his own gain."

Place in hand until played once as an Interrupt card
on any ship.  That ship travels into the future
(disappears for up to 5 turns).  Pre-announce the
return time.

This card has a bunch of different uses.

The first is just to annoy an opponent by getting rid
of their ship for 5 turns just before they're about to
do something important.

Another use is for avoiding the Anti-time Anomaly. You
can play this on yourself just before everyone dies.

You can also use this card to prevent a battle.

Or you can use it to avoid the @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2}.

If you want to be really mean, when the @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2}
is headed toward your opponent's ship, use it on your
opponent so when they get back they are on the borg ship
causing instant death.

You can also use this card just if you don't want your
opponent to move anywhere.  The only thing bad about the
card is that you have to pre-announce the arrival time.
It would be fun to just appear suddenly and not having
your opponent know about it in advance.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #15

Greetings all and welcome to another exciting editon
of Habib's Card of the Day.  Today is the 7th day
of Artifacts and today's artifact is...

    @{b}INTERPHASE GENERATOR@{ub}

    Artifact

@{i}"Experimental Romulan device that both cloaks and
phases matter, allowing it to pass through normal
matter."@{ui}

Use as Equipment card. Nullifies: Chalnoths, Archers
Rebels, Impassible Doors, Phased Matter, Crystalline Entities,
Armus, and Nausicaans.

There isn't really much to say about this card in
terms of strategy.  Basically you use it to get by
some rather annoying dilemmas.  One thing you can do
with it is place dilemmas like Chalnoth and
Crystalline Entity under your own missions so you get
the 5 bonus points.  Also when you use this card be
sure to have an Amanda Rogers in hand to prevent a
disruptor overload, causing you to lose the Artifact.
If you depend on it and lose it, you will probably
lose.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #16

Greeting all and welcome to Habib's Card of the Day.
Today is the 8th day of artifacts and I am proud to
announce the review of...

    @{b}VULCAN STONE OF GOL@{ub}

    Artifact

@{i}"Ancient Vulcan telepathic weapon.  Kills by
magnifying aggresive and violent thoughts, but can
be blocked by peaceful thoughts."@{ui}

Place in hand until played as an Event card.  Kills
everyone in an away team without Youth OR CUNNING>7.
Discard artifact.

This is an okay card.  It is good for killing a
bunch of people but many have CUNNING>7 so it's not
extremely useful.  It would be better if it was
played as an interrupt because then you could play
it just before your opponent attempted a mission.
But because you play it as an event you have to use
it on your own turn and could really only play it
on a stopped away team.  So it is not good in all
situations involving away teams.  That's about all
you can say about this card.

Hello again, today is the final day of artifacts
and nobody is happier than me.  Anyway to finish
them off, today's card is the...

    @{b}VARON-T DISRUPTOR@{ub}

    Artifact

@{i}"Only five of these pistols were made before
being banned by the Federation.  These vicious
weapons disrupt the body from the inside out,
causing a slow and painful death."@{ui}

Use as Equipment card.  Doubles all of your
personnel's STRENGTH where present. (Not
cumulative.)

This card is okay but as far as I can see its
only main purpose would be to easily get by
missions and dilemmas requiring strength.  In
all the games I have played I have had I think
only one away team battle.  So I would not put
this card in a deck to benefit those.  It is
okay for missions but I don't think it's worth
wasting a space in your deck for it.  Also when
in play you should beware of Disruptor Overload,
it can destroy the Varon-T Disruptor easily.

Somehow there was an error in my numbering and
there were two Card of the Day #15.  The correct
#15 was the Interphase Generator.  The Vulcan
Stone of Gol, labeled #15 also, was supposed to
be #16.  I am sorry for any confusion this has

        @{b}Habib's STCCG card of the day #18@{ub}

Hello again and now it's time for another exciting
edition of Habib's Card of the Day.  Today we look
at one of my favorite personnel cards.  That's
right it's...

    @{b}ROGA DANAR@{ub}

    Non-Aligned Personnel

@{i}"Angosian male.  Biochemically altered inot a
formidable perfect warrior ranked Subhadar."@{ui}

    SECURITY

    Command ability

    ENGINEER  Computer Skill  Biology Leadership

    INTEGRITY 5  CUNNING 9  STRENGTH 12

This is a great card.  First of all it's non-aligned
so you can use it in any deck and if I were you I
would too.  He has a ranking of security which is
somewhat hard to come by.  But in addition to that
he has engineering skill too, making him a valuable
asset.  He has a very high strength making missions
and dilemmas requiring lots of strength very easy.

One fun thing you can do with federation is when
Roga is on a ship, that ship can now attack. Because
he is non-aligned and has leadership, he doesn't
have to obey starfleet regulations and can lead a
ship into battle.  This is great with the @{"Enterprise" link COTD3}
because of it's high shields and decent weapons.  If
you have bynars weapon enhancement you can turn the
@{"Enterprise" link COTD3} into a strong attack ship. This can
throw off an opponent not expecting an attack from
the Federation.  It does work great in a federation
deck but it's very useful in any deck.  I use in
every deck of mine, any affiliation.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

Habib's STCCG card of the day #19

Hello all and welcome to Habib's Card of the Day.
Today we look at a pretty good federation card.
It's the first officer of the @{"USS Enterprise" link COTD3}.
That's right, it's...

    @{b}WILLIAM T. RIKER@{ub}

    Federation Personnel

@{i}"Commander William T. Riker is the executive
officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Imzadi to
Deanna Troi. Gourmet cook. Jazz musician."@{ui}

Command ability
Diplomacy  Leadership  Navigation
Honor  Music
INTERGRITY 8  CUNNING 7  STRENGTH 7

This is a decent card to have in a federation deck.
He has a bunch of skills, however they are not very
useful.  Honor is okay but not for federation.
Music is almost worthless.  Navigation is okay, but
there aren't many spots that need it.  His two only
really good skills are diplomacy and leadership.

Diplomacy is always useful in a federation deck due
to the large amount of missions requiring it.  Also
leadership is never a bad thing to have.  So this
card is decent, but not as good as it should be.
I would still use it in a deck but it's not one of
those cards that you just need to have.  They should
have made him better.  This isn't the card of a
person offered any ship in starfleet.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #20

Hello all and now I am finally back.  I decided to
take the Easter weekend off and then some internet
trouble delayed me another day.  Well anyway here
I am and I'm ready to discuss a great interrupt
card.  It's...

    @{b}KEVIN UXBRIDGE@{ub}

    Interrupt

@{i}"Immortal omnipotent being called a Douwd.  Lived
secretly as a human.  Took a human wife who was
killed by the Husnocks at Delta Rana IV."@{ui}

Destroys any one Event card in play (except for
Treaty cards) OR any one artifact in play as an
Event card.

This is a great card to have.  There really isn't
much strategy to it though.  It's basically a good
card and will work in almost any deck.  Cards I
usually cancel with it:

@{"Red Alert" link COTD6} (if they only have one in their deck)

@{"Telepathic Alien Kidnappers" link COTD44} (very annoying)

@{"Anti-Time Anomaly" link COTD21} (you almost have to do this)

@{"Tox Uthat" link COTD11} (don't let them play a Supernova)

And basically any other card that is really
annoying at the moment is a good idea for Kevin.

I recommend you use this card in every deck unless
your opponent uses hardly any events.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #21

Hello again and welcome to Habib's Card of the Day.
Today's card is great if it works, the problem is,
it doesn't work all the time.

    @{b}ANTI-TIME ANOMALY@{ub}

    Event

@{i}"Q-created phenomena.  Rift caused by anti-time
particles in the future.  Anomaly grows backward in
time endangering all life in the past."@{ui}

Plays on table.  Kills literally ALL personnel on
table (both players' cards) at the end of your third
full turn, unless anti-time anomaly destroyed first.

If you can get this card to work, it's great.  The
problem is that your opponent has three turns to get
a @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link COTD20} in their hand to cancel it, usually
this happens.  So when you play it be sure to have a
Q2 in hand to cancel @{"Kevin" link COTD20}.

There are two good ways to play this card.  One is to
play it right away, before you have many personnel out.
Hopefully your opponent has gotten their @{"Red Alert" link COTD6}
and played most of their personnel already.

The other good way is to pack your deck with Temporal Rifts
to avoid the effects of the anomaly.  You can Temporal Rift
yourself just before it kills everyone and you will
not be harmed.  Or you can use the @{"Time Travel Pod" link COTD14}
in the same way.

Hello again and welcome back to Habib's Card of the Day.
I've been having some problems with my internet server
so that's why I haven't been able to post for a few days.
Well it looks like it's okay now so I'll try to post
every day from now on.  So today we will look at in my
opinion the best Medical person in the game.  It's...

    @{b}BEVERLY CRUSHER@{ub}

    Personnel

    Federation Medical

@{i}"Dr. Beverly Crusher is the chief medical officer of the
@{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3}. Dancer and thespian. Widow of Jack Crusher.
Mother of @{"Ensign Wesley Crusher" link COTD26}."@{ui}

Command ability
MEDICAL  Biology  Exobiology
INTEGRITY 8  CUNNING 8  STRENGTH 5

This is a great card because of the fact that she has
medical x2.  This is useful in passing many dilemmas
and missions.  One big bonus with this card is that if
you have a @{"genetronic replicator" link COTD46} in play with Beverly,
no one will die any more.  This really can help you out.

Also a good mission to use with Beverly is Evaluate
Terraforming.  To pass it you need Medical, biology, and
exobiology.  So that equals Beverly Crusher.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #23

Hello all and welcome to another exciting edition of Habib's
Card of the Day.  Today we will look at one of the very best
Romulan personnel there is.

    @{b}SELA@{ub}

    Personnel

    Romulan V.I.P.

@{i}"1/2 Romulan, 1/2 Human female.  Daughter of alternate universe
timeline @{"Lieutenant Natasha Yar" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD165"}.  Powerful operative and key
figure in the Romulan hegemony."@{ui}

Command ability
Diplomacy  Leadership  Treachery
Youth
INTEGRITY 6  CUNNING 9  STRENGTH 8</PRE>

This is a really good card if you are using Romulans.  She has
a bunch of good skills.  Also another good thing is that she
has integrity of 6, so she won't die in a firestorm, something
that almost always works on Romulans.  Treachery is always a
good thing for a Romulan to have because of the great deal of
Romulan missions requiring it.  Also diplomacy is good to get
by stuff too.  And leadership is never a bad thing to have.
If you are playing as Romulans, I suggest you use this card.

Habib's STCCG card of the day #24

Greetings all and welcome again to Habib's Card of the Day.
Today we will look at um... an interesting card.  That's
about all you can say.  It's everyone's favorite card...

    @{b}MOT THE BARBER@{ub}

    Personnel

    Federation Civilian

@{i}"Bolian male.  Convival barber aboard the @{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3}.
Snappy conversationalist."@{ui}

Barbering
INTEGRITY 6  CUNNING 4  STRENGTH 5

Now you may be asking yourself why I put this card in.  To
tell you the truth I'm asking myself the same question.  But
actually I've had a few requests for this card,  plus I just
like it.

Anyway there really isn't a whole lot of strategy
involved in this card.  His numbers are pretty low, and at
the moment barbering is useless.  But one of my readers
actually uses this card.  He says that it is used for
psychological advantage.  Basically so if you win you can
really let your opponent have it.  And if you win by using
Mot's skills, it's even better.  But that's really the only
real use for it as far as I can tell.  Except for to use as
as civilian for the @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13}.  Also for humor value.

Hello again and welcome back to Habib's Card of the Day.
I am very sorry that I have not posted for a few days
but my life has been very busy these last few days.  I
just haven't had the time.  From now on don't be surprised
if you don't see Card of the Day every single day.  But
I'll do my best to get as many in as I can.  I will
probably be able to do one every other day or so.  Well
anyway, todays card is one of my personal favorites.

    @{b}PALOR TOFF-ALIEN TRADER@{ub}

    Interrupt

@{i}"Rich merchant and trader from an unknown race.  Friend

Exchange this card for any non-Personnel card in your
discard pile.

This is just an all around good card to have in any deck.
It's especially good if you're not playing tournament
and can retrieve artifacts.  If you allow this, you can
use the @{"Betazoid gift box" link COTD9} over and over, and get out all
your good cards in a few turns.  But most people won't
allow that.

Other good card to retrieve are @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link COTD20},
@{"Amanda Rogers" link COTD31}, and Q2.  That way if you're out
of cancel cards, you can just get them all back.

Other good cards to get back are @{"Red Alert" link COTD6}, if your opponent
has canceled it, or other nasty events such as Supernovas
or @{"Anti-Time Anomalies" link COTD21}. Also if you want to retrieve a
dead personnel card, you can use Palor Toff on @{"Res-Q" link COTD28} cards
and use them over and over.

Another good use for this card is if your outpost has been
destroyed and you still have some engineers left. Then you
will still have a chance of winning.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #26@{ub}

Hi, folks,

today's card is probably the one everybody expected me to do first, but I
guess, with this net.alias I am just supposed to do it :-)

    @{b}WESLEY CRUSHER@{ub}

    Federation Personnel, rare.

Integrity:6
Cunning: 8
Strength: 5

OFFICER, Youth, ENGINEER, Computer Skill, Astrophysics, Navigation.

@{i}"Ensign Wesley Crusher was a child prodigy. Protege of the @{"Traveler" link COTD4}.
Son of @{"Dr. Beverly Crusher" link COTD22}. Saved the @{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3} 3 1/2 times
as a teenager."@{ui}

In our playing group this card was quickly nicknamed "Poor man's @{"Data"link COTD7}".
This name makes sense insofar as the skills are quite similar (They have
OFFICER, ENGINEER, Computer Skill and Astrophysics in common).

However, the small difference in Skills seems to make @{"Data" link COTD7} a little more
suited for planet missions whereas Wesley with his navigation skill seems
somewhat slated to space missions.

So probably every deck with a need for @{"Data" link COTD7} can also benefit from
including Wesley. Especially when you plan on going around
with more than one ship this card will greatly benefit your
secondary crew.

Even when you just use one ship you still have two chances to get out a
badly needed card without duplicating a personnel.

I include this card in all my federation decks.

Favorite combo(s):

- Use Wesley with @{"Picard" link COTD1} as a two-man "complete any mission"
  team, bringing them in *after* the rest of your crew has sucked up the
  dilemmas.

Hi, folks,

today's card is one of those cards whose name promises much more than
the cards will keep later:

    @{b}KAHLESS@{ub}

    Klingon personnel, rare

Integrity:      10
Cunning:         6
Strength:        8

V.I.P, Honor x2

@{i}"Cloned reincarnation of the Klingon Spiritual leader Kahless the unfor-
gettable. Installed as ceremonial emperor in 2369."@{ui}

This was one of the last cards I got for my set, and with the other Klingon
big guys around I was really awaiting to see awesome stats and skills.
When I then found the card in the pack I was more than just disappointed.
A meager Honor x2 for the top Klingon ?

On second sight however, this card is not as bad as it looks. Granted, it
has nothing to offer in the skill box, but the stats aren't to be ignored.
A Klingon personnel-poor deck can greatly benefit from this card, es-
pecially with missions like Wormhole Negotiations(R), Investigate
Disturbance(R) or Krios Suppression(U). I am including this card in my deck
if I play for example:
- an all-Klingon battle/@{"Rogue Borg" link COTD33} deck with little personnel
- A Fed/Klingon deck that needn't rely on treaties.

Favorite combo(s):

- no combos. More like deck designs (see above).

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #28@{ub}

Hi, folks,

today's card is the first of a series of 5 non-personnel cards which IMHO
make for much more interesting reviews than yet another nice guy...:

    @{b}RES-Q@{ub}

    Event, common

Regenerates a card. Exchange this event for any one card from your discard
pile.

@{i}"Q once saved @{"Captain Jean-Luc Picard" link COTD1}'s life following an injury from a
compressed Tetryon beam"@{ui}

This card seems very similar to the already reviewed @{"Palor Toff" link COTD25}. However
it has one distinct advantage and one not so obvious disadvantage.
On the one hand it can resurrect personnel, too, but ont the downside this
card is one turn slower than @{"Palor Toff" link COTD25} and less useful in emergencies.
So most players reserve this card for resurrecting their personnel and
rely much more on @{"Palor's" link COTD25}.

There is also a much more subtle advantage to this card which is actually
a psychological one. When you need to be absolutely sure to resurrect some
card, you can count on your opponent not wasting a @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link COTD20}(U) on
your Res-Q (she thinks "Oh, just some personnel"), but many smart players use
@{"Amanda Rogers" link COTD32}(U) on @{"Palor Toff" link COTD25} thereby effectively getting two strong
cards out of their way.

Favorite combo(s):

- This card works very well in conjunction with @{"Palor Toff" link COTD25}(C). I stack lots
  of @{"Palors" link COTD25} and just one or two Res-Q's. When I then need a personnel
  I use @{"Palor" link COTD25} on Res-Q, when I need something else I saved myself a turn...
- The above-mentioned bluff. The resurrected card will most probably be some
  nasty interrupt then...

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #29@{ub}

Hi, folks,

today's card is probably my favorite dilemma:

    @{b}BARCLAY'S PROTOMORPHOSIS DISEASE@{ub}

    Planet/Space Dilemma, rare

    Point value: 10

Entire crew or away team (except andriods) de-evolves (dies) unless
MEDICAL, SCIENCE and SECURITY present. Discard Dilemma.

@{i}"Contagious affliction which causes animals to de-evolve into ancestral
forms. Disease named for Lieutenant Reginald Barclay."@{ui}

This Dilemma qualifies as my most used in any deck type and against any
opponent, because it has three distinct features:

- The Planet/Space distinction makes it useful even against those "6
  planet" or "6 space" surprise decks.
- Its effects are great.
- It's not too easy too overcome.

Many players seem to get panicked when they fall behind on points and
that's probably the best time to nail them with this dilemma. Also, if I can
figure out where my opponent is going to place her outpost, that's the location
to place this. She will probably try to uncover an artifact there quickly
and beam down with an incomplete crew - BAM!

The card is effective alone (when you are short on usable dilemmas) or
even more so behind cards which drag away personnel. Useful preparations for
this card include the @{"Tarellian Plague Ship" link COTD43}(U) or the @{"Love Interests" link COTD74}(C). A
quick Disruptor Overload on a Medical Kit is another way of increasing the
effectiveness of this card.

Favorite combo(s):

- This one after a @{"female love interest" link COTD74}(C). The latter will suck up what
  will most probably be a SCIENCE or MEDICAL and your chances of nailing
  somebody suddenly improved!

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #30@{ub}

Hi, folks,

today I am getting really lazy and to save some typing, let's use a card
with a really short name:

    @{b}Q@{ub}

    Planet/Space dilemma, rare

    Point value: 0

If 2 Leadership and INTEGRITY>60 discard all dilemmas here. Otherwise, it
allows opponent to rearrange spaceline locations. Discard Dilemma.

@{i}"Incorrigible, extra-dimensional member of the Q continuum, a race of
omnipotent beings. Q exhibits a childlike petulance and sense of playfulness."@{ui}

Along the lines of yesterday's review, I am once again evaluating this
dilemma under three aspects: Flexibility, Effect and Requirements.

While the requirements are the hardest for any dilemma, this card vastly
lacks on the effects side. At best, this can slow my opponent down by
two or three turns, but not in a way as predictable as say a @{"Rogue Borg" link COTD33}(C).

The best use for this card IMHO is using it as a great dilemma-nullifier
under a location you intend to visit with a large crew. Play Q there last
so there will not be any other dilemma encountered first and you will
know exactly what to expect.

When arranging the spaceline I tend to isolate my opponent's ships on one
side and all the missions he can still complete on the other, making sure
the outpost is also far away from any of my opponent's missions.
Not a card for any deck, but a nice surprise anyway...

Favorite combo(s):

- Place this last under my own outpost and a put a bunch of artifacts
  (or at least a @{"Horga'hn" link COTD10}) there, too. Then wait for my Federation crew
  to do its work. (Works best with crew-laden, dilemma-heavy decks that
  play very fast)

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #31@{ub}

Hi, folks,

before we return to one more member of our beloved bridge crew, let's
just take a quick look at one of my favorite interrupts:

    @{b}AMANDA ROGERS@{ub}
    Interrupt, uncommon.

Nullifies any one Interrupt card just played (except Kevin Uxbridge or
another Amanda Rogers) OR any one Artifact just played as an Interrupt
card.

@{i}"Female Q raised as a human on earth. Was taken to the Q continuum by Q after she could not resist the benevolent use of her powers."@{ui}

This is a very defensive card. Its use is to ensure your own flow of the
game when your opponent tries to disrupt you with some or another nasty
interrupt. Prime candidates for Amanda's power are The Devil(R) when
used on my Horga'hn(R), Crosis(R) (turning the tide in about any
rogue Borg attack) and Disruptor overload(C).

A less obvious use of Amanda is to nullify interrupts your opponent plays
on himself. Although most players will be smart enough to use her on a
Palor Toff(C), I also like nullifying any Scan-type card or Particle
fountain(C). The latter play once saved me a game when I could keep my
opponent on 95 and then pass 100 points on my next turn. Needless to say
he was p*ss*d :-)

Favorite combo(s):

- Use one Amanda twice by Palor'ing her out of the discard pile when the
  opponent Q2's her away...
- Amanda my opponent's Palor Toffs as he tries to retrieve an urgently
  needed interrupt.

Hi, folks,

let's continue with the next installment for the Bridge Crew reviews:

    @{b}GEORDI LA FORGE@{ub}

    Federation Personnel, rare

Integrity: 8
Cunning: 8
Strength: 6

ENGINEER x2, Navigation, Physics, Computer Skill

Command ability (*)

@{i}"Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge is chief engineer aboard the
@{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3}. Great sense of humor. Fortuitous holodeck programmer."@{ui}

Geordi belongs to the few personnel who are actually named on a mission
(Evaluate Terraforming(R)). This and the fact that he comes very close to
solving the Explore Dyson Sphere(R) thing all on himself (he'll just need
one lowly Engineer to help him) makes him a somewhat special character.

But IMHO his major Strength lies in overcoming dilemmas. There are three
dilemmas that require two ENGINEER, one dilemma that can be overcome
by one ENGINEER and one that needs Computer Skill. This makes him alone a
solution to 11% of all dilemmas not counting those others where he is the
keystone to a two-personnel solution.

This and his very balanced, high attributes make him one of the very best
Federation cards.

Like @{"Wesley" link COTD26}, Geordi has his Strength more in Space dilemmas and missions
than in the planet ones.

It should lastly not be forgotten that this card can be a potential life-
saver when it comes to battle as he will increase @{"Nutational Shields" link COTD40} by
4 points. All ships with shields of 8 or more (which includes all the
Galaxy class starships) are thus protected against a @{"Borg" link COTD2} direct
destruction.

Favorite combo(s):

- As stated: Geordi + @{"Nutational shields" link COTD40} makes for a not-so-vulnerable
  ship compared to a @{"Borg cube" link COTD2}. I always keep him aboard when
  attempting space missions.

- Bryan uses Geordi together with @{"Data" link COTD7} to solve the missions requiring
  Engineering as their extra skills fit those greatly. Needless to say, his
  deck has lots of these missions...

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #33@{ub}

Hi, folks,

today I'm reviewing the one card everybody either hates or loves (and I've
never seen any player having just one in their deck - either it's none or
it's heaps!):

    @{b}ROGUE BORG MERCENARIES@{ub}

    Interrupt, common.

Plays on any occupied ship. Battles crew now and at the start of every
players' turn. Two Borg=2 STRENGTH each, three =3 each, etc. Surviving
Borg remain.


@{i}"Upon Hugh's return to the Borg collective, the Borg became self-aware.
Soon, many unquestioningly followed their first leader, Lore."@{ui}

This is a card that has two distinct uses and also probably the one card
for which the possible combos have a little too obviously been presented in
the card texts.

The first use of RB is of course mass elimination of opponents' crews.
With a force of six or more RB you are pretty sure to cause some damage and if
you get a lucky draw for the first one killed you'll eliminate that officer
and take free shots at the rest of the crew.

Note that battle occurs twice every full turn so five RB will only last
three turns should they get on the losing side.

The more subtle (and even more devastating) use of the RB is playing them
one at a time at the start of your opponent's turn. Although the RB is easily
beaten, the crew is stopped for that turn and next turn you can play
another RB.

So it is essentially a half-strength Temporal Rift, too. Actually it's
better than that as you can also attack the affected ship without fearing
the retaliation shot.

Favorite combo(s):

- Rogue Borg + Rogue Borg + Rogue Borg + Rogue Borg + [...] + Crosis:
  One less crew

- Rogue Borg + Temporal Rift: Three turns gained to draw something
  sensible or get a few points

- Rogue Borg (x5) + Crosis + Lore returns on a ship that just wanted to
  leave an opponent's outpost: As soon as the battle is over beam the RB
  down to the outpost and Uxbridge her Red Alert: She'll never play a
  single personnel that won't get killed. (Hey, that was a tournament win
  for me!)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #34@{ub}

Hi, folks,

after yesterday's offensive card let's take a quick look at its counterpart:

    @{b}HUGH@{ub}

    Interrupt, rare

Nullifies attack by @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2} OR destroys(discard) all @{"Rogue Borg" link COTD33} at one
location.

@{i}"The Federation named a rescued Borg, Hugh. When he returned, his newly
acquired self-aware personality collapsed the Borg collective."@{ui}

The card text already states that Hugh has two uses, one somewhat
sensible, the other one not so sensible at all.

The more efficient use is to play him on a bunch of @{"Rogue Borg" link COTD33} when they
are strong enough to wipe out your crew or just keep you from completing
an important mission. However, in the latter case of a disturbing attack by a
single @{"RB" link COTD33}, @{"Amanda Rogers" link COTD31}(U) will have the same effect and she is a much
more versatile card. Also, there are quite a lot of other defenses against
an @{"RB" link COTD33} attack. Both the Temporal Rift(U) and the
@{"Emergency Transporter Armbands" link COTD95}(C) will effectively nullify an attack by removing the
legal target (occupied ship). Also, a simple Phaser/Disruptor and a large crew
will make the number of @{"RB" link COTD33} needed to successfully win prohibitively high unless
there is at least one Crosis with them. In most cases I just resort to
@{"Amanda'ing" link COTD31} the Crosis and the rest will most probably fall.

Even of less use is the "nullify @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2} attack" function. As you can con-
trol when to attempt missions, there is no need to uncover a @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2}
with a defenseless ship of yours unless you're in a really bad position to
start with. The only justification for including Hugh on this basis is when
you play the @{"Borg ship" link COTD2} yourself and need a defense in case your opponent gets
it a little too early for your taste...

Favorite combo(s):

- None. Hugh is just a counterspell.
  (OOPS, that was the MtG player speaking :-) )

Hi, folks,

and welcome to a new (second last) installment of our fabulous eight:

    @{b}WORF@{ub}

    Federation Personnel, rare.

Integrity: 8
Cunning: 6
Strength: 10

SECURITY, Honor x 2, Navigation, Diplomacy, Command Star(*).

@{i}"Lieutenant Worf is chief of security on the @{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3}. Klingon
Warrior and Starfleet officer. Son of Mogh. Raised on Earth by foster
parents."@{ui}

This card is IMHO the second best Security officer in the game after
@{"Roga Danar" link COTD18}. No Federation deck can really afford to be without him.
One of the most overlooked abilities of Worf is the fact that he counts as
a Klingon as well for cards as @{"Klingon Death Yell" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD123"}(R) or
@{"Klingon Right of Vengeance" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD130"}(C). Especially in a mixed Klingon/Federation deck this ability
makes for a good use of these otherwise not-so-useful interrupts.

Worf's Honor, Diplomacy and Navigation make him much more suited to
mission-solving than to suck up Dilemmas, however in most decks he will pro-
vide the much needed security and thus the player is forced to expose these
valuable skills. I might however leave him behind when I have both @{"Roga Danar" link COTD18}
and Tasha Yar in my away team.

Worf's attributes make him one of the rare crewmembers who are quite
proficient in all three areas. Especially as Strength is a bit on the low
side for those little Feds, he can make up for this almost alone.

His major drawback is the (quite well-known) Worf-@{"Wesley" link COTD26} duel paradox.
When these two characters come to battle one-on-one (I know this isn't legal
with today's rules, but there might be a card for this someday... [Let's call
it Conspiracy (event): Your Federation crew may now attack all affiliations.])
@{"Wesley" link COTD26} wins hands down as he's an Officer capable of leading an away
team battle, but Worf is not. Well probably Worf is impaling himself on his
Bat'Elth at this thought and that's why. :-)

Favorite combo(s):

- Worf + @{"Honor Challenge" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD144"}(R): Two less Rommies (One for the Challenge, one
  for the Strength)
- Worf + @{"Klingon Right of Vengeance" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD130"}: 20 Strength. Ouch!
- Worf + Alexander : Just because it's cool.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #36@{ub}

Hi, folks,

today I'm doing something for those of you who like those Romulans:

    @{b}ALIDAR JAROK@{ub}

    Romulan personnel, Rare

Integrity 2
Cunning 8
Strength 8

OFFICER, Navigation, Leadership, Command Star (*).

@{i}"Conscientious admiral who questioned Romulan policy. Eventually stole a
scout ship and defected to the Federation in 2366."@{ui}

At first glance this card doesn't look that bad. Leadership skill, plus two
8's in attributes plus the command star makes for nice reading. Even that
Navigation will fit quite handy for a few space missions...

But then, there are some doubts. Integrity 2 and Firestorm? @{"Alien Parasites" link COTD38}?
And only two skills? Isn't there anything better?

Yes there is. And the best thing about that "anything better" is: It isn't
even rare! A lowly uncommon Tebok has one less Cunning than Alidar, but
you get a Diplomacy, three extra Integrity (making him Firestorm-resistant)
and one more Strength.

What did you say? You need more than one Romulan Officer with
Leadership and Navigation? Well, try @{"Toreth" link COTD89}! She's got one less Strength
than Alidar, but once again, that 5 Integrity and an extra Honor !

To summarize, I can only say Decipher really screwed up on this card. Like
the Type VI Shuttle (6/2/4) easily replaced by a runabout (7/5/5) or the
uncommon Sutherland (*+,7/7/7) that can be replaced both by a common
@{"Nebula" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD108"} (*+,8/7/8) or a non-aligned common @{"Mercenary Ship" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD137"} (++,7/7/7) this is
one of those "filler" cards that don't make any sense to play.

Note to M:tG players here: Your game isn't better in this respect, only in
many cases the two cards to be compared are at least different colors
which makes some sense. Here I'm always talking SAME AFFILIATION!

Favorite combo(s):

- Well, er, I'm stumped here. What shall I do with a rare card that's worse
  than an uncommon of the same affiliation ?

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #37@{ub}

Hi, folks,

did I hear anybody say common personnel are useless ? I'll prove the oppo-
site:

    @{b}VEKOR@{ub}

    Non-aligned personnel, common.

Integrity 2
Cunning 7
Strength 6

SCIENCE, MEDICAL, Navigation, Geology, Command Star (*)

@{i}"Representative of female mercenaries operating throughout the Galaxy.
Worked with Baran to find the Stone of Gol."@{ui}

Now that's a card ! Medical is the most sought-after classification (Two
times as many cards that need it than those who supply it) and Science ranks
third on this scale (About a 1-1 ratio). Then you get Command ability, two
extra skills, a female (great for @{"Matriarchal society" link COTD50}), the ability to use
more than one of these at a time, the permission to use her in any deck
(non-aligned IS handy) and on top of all this there is above-average
STRENGTH and CUNNING. And all this for the price of a single lousy common !

The only drawback is that 2 Integrity, meaning she will get affected by
Firestorms, but quite a few decks will be capable of working around this with
either @{"Genetronic Replicators" link COTD46}(U) or with a two-wave attempt at mission
solving.

Don't forget about the various * Scan interrupts and the fact that no space
location can hide a Firestorm anyway.

Now what can you use a Vekor for? Just a few examples:
@{"Crystalline Entity" link COTD52}(Planet), @{"Tarellian Plague Ship" link COTD43}, Gravitic Mine,
Cosmic String Filament, Menthar Booby Trap, @{"Iconian Computer Weapon" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD129"},
@{"Relief Mission" link COTD64}. Well, these are only those cards she defeats SINGLE-HANDEDLY.
I won't bother listing those she can at least half solve...

For convenience, I just list here all cards that have two different
classifications, probably there are more than you think...
@{"Wesley Crusher" link COTD26}(R), @{"Data" link COTD7}(R), Eric Pressman(U), Bok(U) (OFFICER/ENGINEER)
@{"Mirok" link COTD57}(U), Dr. Reyga(U) (ENGINEER/SCIENCE),
@{"Roga Danar" link COTD18}(R) (SECURITY/ENGINEER)
and of course Vekor herself.

Favorite combo(s):

- None. Seriously, this card is good enough on herself.

- On second thought: Vekor and any Dilemma of my opponent except
  Firestorm and @{"female love interest" link COTD74} :-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #38@{ub}

Hi, folks,

I assume you're all waiting, so let's jump right into it with:

    @{b}ALIEN PARASITES@{ub}

    Planet Dilemma, uncommon.

Unless INTEGRITY >32, Away team infected. They beam back and opponent im-
mediately controls ship and crew until "stopped". Then turn resumes.

@{i}"Intelligent parasites enter and take control of a humanoid. Their presence
can be detected by a gill like protrusion on the back of a host's neck."@{ui}

Let's try that one by the three criteria for a dilemma:

Effect: Powerful. You have a lot of options once this dilemma has taken hold.
First, you can use the crew to solve a mission and get the points (and arti-
facts) that go along with it. Nice if this is the last (or only) dilemma at
a location, you can just beam back down, take the mission and whatever comes
with it.

However, situations are less than perfect so let's consider a few other
options. Second best is of course to indirectly further your own needs
and do some damage along the way. So just assume you placed a
@{"Barclay's disease" link COTD29} under a mission you want to later espionage at.
Send the opponent's crew there, beam down all crewmembers except for the
SCIENCE guys, have them die. Then redshirt the next dilemma with the SCIENCE
you've left. Result: Two dilemmas AND a crew of the opponent's gone :-).

Of course, if you cannot benefit from it, do as much harm as possible. A
@{"Borg Ship" link COTD2} or a @{"Crystalline Entity" link COTD52} should come handy. If nothing is viable,
at least move away as far as possible and make opponent lose one turn moving
back.

Difficulty overcoming: Too low. Any away team worth its name has those 33
INTEGRITY. Even Rommie players will make sure they have enough for this one.

Solution: Play after some nasties. Armus, Alien Abduction and the various
opponent's choice Dilemmas come in handy.

Flexibility: No flexibility in placement as this requires combo play. Great
however once active.

Note: Being affected by this one and then seeing your opponent passing 100
using your crew is one of the most embarrassing ways to lose! Makes for good
bragging if you win like this :-) ObBrag: I did it once.

Hi, folks,

let's get finished with that #*?&amp;$ bridge crew stuff:

    @{b}DEANNA TROI@{ub}

    Federation personnel, rare

Integrity 8
Cunning 7
Strength 4

OFFICER, Empathy, Diplomacy, Command Star (*).<BR>

@{i}"Lt. Commander Deanna Troi is a 1/2 Betazoid, 1/2 human empath. Counselor
for @{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3}. Imzadi to @{"William T. Riker" link COTD19}. Loves Chocolate."@{ui}

So that's all? Hey, everybody has more OFFICERS than needed, there are
cards with Diplomacy that are actually useful and Empathy, well who ever
plays with *Empathy*??? Then you get a few attribute points and that's it.
Not even half worth the money you pay for it.

So, instead of all those combos and playing tips I usually start giving out
here, let's hear the voices of my co-gods (raters) on this card (in no specific
order):

@{i}"Don't have."@{ui}
                        Says everything, doesn't it ?
@{i}"Nice to look at, but not terribly useful."@{ui}
                        I totally agree with the second part :-)
@{i}"Well apart from her good looks, not a very useful card"@{ui}
                        Are we getting repetitive ?
@{i}"However, would you play a complete Bridge crew deck without her ?"@{ui}
                        Yeah, for a Bragging deck...
@{i}"I don't do much with empaths"@{ui}
                        Wise decision.
@{i}"Two-dimensional creatures disable them for the rest of the game."@{ui}
                        Right that is.
@{i}"Her mom is better for empathy."@{ui}
                        And the card pictures Majel Barret. Definite plus.
@{i}"... and so is @{"Devinoni Ral" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD142"} because he has an extra skill."@{ui}
                        and he's non-aligned and he's uncommon...
@{i}"Empathy doesn't do much"@{ui}
                        Have we heard this before ?
@{i}"Don't have her, sorry."@{ui}
                        TWO who don't have her. Traded her away ?
@{i}"Command ability helps..."@{ui}
                        Yes, there are only 20 Feds who have it...
@{i}"...but you don't need an extra Diplomacy with people like @{"Picard" link COTD1} around."@{ui}
                        At last - one GOOD card named in this post :-)
@{i}""
                        OK, some people go by the 'If you can't say anything
                        nice, you should not say anything at all' saying...

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #40@{ub}

Hi, folks,

I'm really getting tired of that one-card-a-day routine, so let's bring about
some change and do TWO cards in one article:

    @{b}NUTATIONAL SHIELDS / METAPHASIC SHIELDS@{ub}

    Events, both uncommon.

Plays on table. New technology enhances each of your ship's shields +2 for
each ENGINEER [SCIENCE] aboard. Cumulative.

@{i}"Nutation adjusts the shield frequency phase rotation, thereby increasing
shield efficiency. Used against the Borg in 2367."@{ui} [Nutational]
@{i}"Revolutionary shields using overlapping subspace fileds. Invented by Ferengi
Dr. Reyga."@{ui} [Metaphasic]

Yeah, two cards, one effect. The only little difference is the trigger. Of
course this difference isn't that small and actually it's a way to make this
card type a little more powerful than it would otherwise be. Depending on
deck style, some people play with more ENGINEERS than SCIENCE (the majority),
some others (especially Klingon players) have the ratio inversed.

And don't forget that in Highlander decks this is an opportunity to quasi
include two of this highly useful card in your deck.

Now what is it actually worth ? Shields are used in various instances in the
game and are affected by attacks, two dilemmas and two interrupts.
Now what shield strength do you need to overcome various problems ?

Here's a list:

A Shields 5               to survive Loss of Orbital Stability(C Int)
B Shields 7               to survive @{"Crystalline Entity" link COTD52}(R Dil).    <BR>
C Shields 8               to avoid Auto-Destruct Sequence(U Int) damage
                          Survive any number of @{"Borg" link COTD2} attacks, if docked at
                                  a Romulan or Klingon Outpost
D Shields 9               Immunity to non-enhanced ship weapons
                          Survive any number of @{"Borg" link COTD2} attacks, if docked at
                                  a Federation Outpost.
E Shields 11              Immunity to ships with @{"Bynars weapon enhancement" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD197"}(R)
F Shields 12              Survive a single @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2}(R Dil) hit (anywhere)
G Shields 24              Survive any number of @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2} attacks (anywhere)
H Shields 27              Immunity to @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13}'ed ships.

Reasonably, you can expect to gain 4 to 6 SHIELDS on each of your ships. For
the more commonly used ships, this would give the Galaxy class and other big
ships at least an "F" protection, Runabouts are now "D" or "E", even the
small Shuttles are at least "A", if not "B" or "C" protected. Having both
cards in play could make a @{"Husnock ship" link COTD41} "G", as 2 times 6 plus the basic
12 just pushes it over the edge.

A well-equipped @{"Enterprise" link COTD3} with @{"Wesley" link COTD26}(2), @{"Data" link COTD7}(2), @{"Geordi" link COTD32}(4),
@{"Roga Danar" link COTD18}(2) and an Engineering Kit(8; @{"Wes" link COTD26},@{"Data" link COTD7},@{"Riker" link COTD19} & @{"Picard" link COTD1}) could even
qualify for "H", meaning it would withstand a shot from a massive Warbird
with a @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13} aboard without even taking a single dent... (Using the
Nutational variant, accomplishing this with Metaphasic shields seems less
realistic).

In my decks, I only use one of these cards (normally the Nutational, as my
best decks are Fed or Rommies). With those lots of Engineering personnel I
get enough protection from just one and an Engineering kit also doubles the
protection besides having additional uses.

Favorite combo(s):

- My above standard crew + the shield enhancer: Just fire at me, may I start
  laughing ?
- Nutational Shields + Engineering kit
- Metaphasic Shields + Tricorder

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #41@{ub}

Hi, folks,

everybody is getting crazy about that new expansion to that other CCG, but
this should not stop me from posting a new card (though I am wading in
booster wrappers, too :-) )

If I am right, we haven't had a ship in ... well a long time, so today's
is:

    @{b}HUSNOCK SHIP@{ub}

    Non-aligned ship, uncommon, universal.

Range 6
Weapons 9
Shields 12

Requirement: *++

Holodeck, Tractor Beam

@{i}"With a single thought, @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link COTD20} killed the entire Husnock race (150
billion lives) everywhere in the universe. Their powerful ships remain."@{ui}

With this ship comes a great advantage (Shields 12), a possible advantage
(Holodeck; great for Klingons and Romulans) and a major disadvantage (Range
6). So we have a card that will be incredibly useful for some strategies and
devastating to others.

Let's first look at the decks this card will not fit. A prototype for this is
my Federation-only tournament deck built for maximum speed. With a range of
6 most moves will be 2 or even 1 location only, so a trip from on end of the
spaceline to the other will easily cost me 8 turns I do not have in a speed
deck. To summarize, any deck built on speed or any deck designed to counter
speed decks will not benefit from a Husnock Ship.

However there is a deck type that can make a devastating use out of a single
Husnock. I call this the "25-0" deck. This style of play requires lots of
Dilemmas and battling and piles of cards designed to slow down the opponent so
she won't solve any mission. Normally I build such a deck around Romulans and
Space missions so I can make use of Holo personnel. Required cards are
Crosis(R), 4 to 7 @{"Rogue Borg" link COTD33}(C), Lore returns(R) and @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13}(R).
A Supernova(R) and a @{"Tox Uthat" link COTD11}(R) don't hurt, either. Alternatively and less
riskily you can supply a @{"Bynars' Weapon Enhancement" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD197"} or two. My personnel is
strongly supplemented by non-aligned folks with high Integrity so I can throw
in a @{"Q" link COTD30} to get my @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13}. The Idea behind it is: Solve the @{"Q'ed" link COTD30} mission
with the @{"Naiskos" link COTD13} underneath (25 pts), use it on the Husnock for Weapons 27 and
simply shoot at everything that starts moving. Unless the opponent has mul-
tiple shield enhancers, she'll lose a ship every turn. If all goes well I
manage to sneak a @{"RB" link COTD33} force into her outpost or Supernova it away,
removing her from the game.

Favorite combo(s):

- As shown above. More a deck design, but the key cards are @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13}
  and perhaps a @{"Bynars' Weapon Enhancement" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD197"} (WEAPONS 33 - Kill those pesky
  outposts!)

Hi, folks,

yesterday's trekdinner was a bit long, so you had to wait a day longer for
the answer to life...



the universe...



and the burning question...



What is the WORST card in Star Trek: CCG ?







Well, the answer is:



    @{b}TACHYON DETECTION GRID@{ub}

    Interrupt, common.

Must have at least four of your ships in play to use. Play on any cloaked
ship to detect its presence. Ship is forced to de-cloak for rest of turn.

@{i}"Network of active tachyon beams between many ships. Devised by
@{"Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge" link COTD32} in 2368 to detect cloaked vessels."@{ui}

Ho-Hum. So where do I start analyzing here? Obviously this card has two fa-
cets worth reviewing. A prerequisite and an effect. Let's ignore the prerequi-
site for a moment and look at the effect: One ship is forced to de-cloak for
rest of turn. What can I do with it? Yep, I can attack that ship, provided
neither of the player plays Feds (If I do, I cannot attack, if he does, what
cloaked ship?). Also, at least one of us must be a Klingon player, as Rommies
cannot attack other Rommies. So to get a chance of using this, we must have
one out of the K/K, R/K or K/R combinations. Even if all nine affiliation
combinations had the same probability, this would work out to a 67% chance of
the card having NO EFFECT AT ALL! (Actually, it's worse - Most people play
Federation).

So let's think of not attacking but playing an interrupt (or event) that can
not affect cloaked ships:

We could use @{"Warp Core Breach" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD111"}(R), but he has an
ENGINEER aboard, pretty sure. Nah.

@{"Neural Servo Device" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD136"}(U)? Works only on
non-aligned ships, so no cloaking device.

@{"Incoming message" link COTD68}(U) ?  Why not wait
until he de-cloaks to attempt a mission - He'll be much further away from the
outpost then!

Temporal Rift(U) ? This is a natural event, so you can play
it on the cloaked ship.

@{"Rogue Borg" link COTD33}(C) ? Again, I can wait; it doesn't really
matter when my opponent loses a few turns and personnel - he cannot attempt a
mission before I get him.

Disruptor Overload(C) ? Once again - wait.

Ship Seizure(C) ? Hey - cloaked ships are not empty!

@{"Time Travel Pod" link COTD14}(R) ? Again - patience, your time will come!

So isn't there anything we could do ? Sorry ? What did you suggest here ?

Plasma Fire(U) ? Nice try. Could actually work as SECURITY is not that common.

So let me summarize: We have a card that allows us to use a Plasma Fire on
a cloaked ship. Great.

Now let's take a look at the cost: We need four ships in play. So that means
we need five or six in the deck to get them out. Six ships ? Anybody playing
with more than four ? Doh. Add a card slot in your deck that could be used for
something sensible (like a Temporal Rift, if you don't have any better ideas)
and you're stuck with four useless cards (2 ships + the Grid + the Plasma
Fire).

But I won't discourage anybody from using it, as long as he plays against
me :-)

Favorite combo(s):

- You didn't expect me to write anything here, did you ??
- On second thought: Four of them in my opponent's deck.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #43@{ub}

Hi, folks,

really got you yesterday, didn't I ? :-) Too bad I don't have another nasty
idea, just a nasty dilemma:

    @{b}TARELLIAN PLAGUE SHIP@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space, uncommon.

    5 points.

All ship's crew immediately die from plague unless MEDICAL volunteers to
permanently beam over (discarded) to Tarellians. Discard Dilemma.

@{i}"Ship containing the survivors of a Tarellian War plague. Infected from
biological weapons, they are now refused entry everywhere."@{ui}

Oops, nice card! You actually get an improved Armus and a weakened
@{"Barclay's disease" link COTD29} in one card.

The dilemma could also be worded: "Unless MEDICAL present, all of ship's crew
are killed. If there are survivors, one MEDICAL (owner's choice) is killed."
Of course, this doesn't sound as good, but it shows the two-dilemma nature of
this card.

Analysis for the first part:
Effect: great. Maximum damage, not preventable by @{"Genetronic replicators" link COTD46} or
similar nasty stuff.
Conditions to overcome: quite easy. No serious player goes anywhere without
at least one MEDICAL.
Flexibility: Not too great. Most people play more planet than space missions,
so you don't get too much choice.
Conclusion: The first part in itself would at best make a mediocre dilemma.

Analysis for the second part:
Effect: Pretty standard. One less crewmember. Owner's choice, too. But we get
to nail a MEDICAL, which is the most-needed skill. Also, chances are very
good we get rid of a female, so let's use that @{"Love Interest" link COTD74} +
@{"Matriarchal Society" link COTD50} combo elsewhere.
Conditions to overcome: Well, I don't see a way around...
Flexibility: As for part 1.
Conclusion: Nice little Space Armus. One minor benefit, one minor drawback,
if compared head to head.

Total evaluation: An Armus with a minor chance to get the whole crew. Works
best on those Equipment-heavy players, depending on the rules you play by
(is there an official ruling on this ?) the opponent either loses OFFICER +
Medical kit or if this is disallowed, the whole crew. Oops...

Combinations: Would combine quite well with the female-hosers, unfortunately
these are all planet stuff. Sets you up quite nicely for a @{"Barclay's disease" link COTD29}
or a Menthar booby trap, but for nothing else :-(

A definite inclusion in every deck (though I might sideboard it in a tourney,
as there are so many planet missions played there)

Favorite combo(s):

- Place it right before a @{"Barclay's disease" link COTD29}(R): get one with the first, the
  rest with the second :-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #44@{ub}

Hi, folks,

let's today take a look at one half of the most talked-about killer combo:

    @{b}TELEPATHIC ALIEN KIDNAPPERS@{ub}

    Event, uncommon.

Plays on table. At end of each turn, guess a card type and point to a card in
your opponent's hand. Card must be shown. If guessed correctly, card is dis-
carded.

@{i}"Unknown aliens abducted @{"Captain Jean-Luc Picard" link COTD1} for telepathic studies about
authority in 2366."@{ui}

Let's approach this card by comparing it to another: The @{"Static Warp Bubble" link COTD48}.
Three differences are visible: First, @{"Static Warp Bubble" link COTD48} always works, a card
is dropped every turn. Second, while the opponent has control over his discards
with the bubble, TAK divides control between chance and the player of
the event. Lastly, TAK is only countered by one card while SWB has two cards
working against it.

So there is the tradeoff between the number of cards you get to remove from
your opponent's game and the power of these cards. With TAK your best bet is
to concentrate on one of the more commonly used card types (Personnel or
Event) and to try to deny your opponent one of these card types. With @{"SWB" link COTD48},
you can just hope to keep it in play long enough to remove all choice of
which card to play.

Now of course, clever players have devised a killer combo using TAK and a-
nother event named @{"Alien Probe" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD133"}. They use the @{"Probe" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD133"} to expose their
opponent's hand and the TAK to steal the best card each turn. In spite of this
having been declared legal by Decipher in friendly play, this combo has
been outlawed for tournament play.

Our group here didn't take that approach to it, but we went by the card text.
The house rule is now: When targeted by TAK, you are allowed to shuffle your
hand and present it to the owner of TAK face down. This even applies when
@{"Alien Probe" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD133"} is in play, though the whole hand must be uncovered again after
the guess.
With this rule, there is still an advantage to the combo (you see what card
types are most common or most dangerous on the hand), but it is not as devas-
tating.

A nice summary for this card comes from Bryan, and I think I couldn't say it
much better, so Bryan -
> What's up, Wes ?
could you take over for a sec ?
> eh for the TAK, yes. Sorry my group has outlawed this card. It makes a good
> @{"Kevin Ux" link COTD20} "sucker". Gets rid of KU for other, more destructive
> events.
Thanx a lot. People always panic over this card...

Favorite combo(s):

- Well, I don't like the TAK/@{"Alien probe" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD133"} combo (see our house rule above),
  I just prefer TAK+@{"Static Warp bubble" link COTD48} for removing 1.5 cards each turn.

- Not too bad: TAK + @{"Thought Maker" link COTD12}! Arrange all his good Events to the top,
  then TAK them away, especially if he has few cards in hand.

- TAK + Q2: Opponent panicks, @{"Kev Ux" link COTD20}, Q2 => my turn and one interrupt less to
  worry about.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #45@{ub}

Hi, folks,

today's card is a dilemma that isn't really a dilemma but a nasty choice:

    @{b}SARJENKA@{ub}

    Dilemma, planet, rare.

Primitive Alien begs for help. Ignore her (discard dilemma) OR help her and
earn 5 bonus points, but all away teams here are stopped.

@{i}"Alien child from Drema IV. Her radio pleas for help were answered by
@{"Lt. Commander Data" link COTD7} in violation of the Prime Directive."@{ui}

This card has three uses. First, throw it under one of your opponent's
missions, especially if you play a dilemma-heavy, fast deck. Especially if your
opponent's away team is decimated you might hold him off for another turn at
a low price. Of course, this works best against not-so-experienced players as
they will probably take every chance to gain five points for free (well not
so free, but they don't realize).

Second, use it as a quick push over the 100 limit. With three solved
missions, you quite often get stuck at 95, so it would be nice to know a place
where you can take the remaining five without risk. Of course you could do
the same with a Particle Fountain, but this takes up a slot in your play deck
instead of your seed cards.

Third and best, there is a deck type that works with this card. Just place a
Sarjenka last (encountered first) at your outpost to somehow make five points
with whatever crew (single Ensign Chump?). Stock 22 other Dilemmas to make
your draw deck as small as possible. Next, just throw lots of @{"RB" link COTD33},
Temporal Rifts, Incoming Messages at your opponent so they won't be able to
complete any mission. Add a few @{"Kivas Fajos" link COTD49} and @{"Travellers" link COTD4} to make your card play
play faster. This deck will obviously win 5-0 unless your opponent has lots of
@{"Amandas" link COTD31}. Best about it is that you won't need more than one personnel card...
Just imagined telling your opponent: "I will beat you with NO ships and only
a @{"Mot the Barber" link COTD24} as Personnel" and keeping that promise.
Nice surprise too for tournament finals if deck rebuilding is allowed between
rounds.

Favorite combo(s):

- Sarjenka + Distortion of Space/Time continuum: I am stopped - NOT !

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #46@{ub}

Hi, folks,

now that I've given you quite a few ways of killing off opponents' personnel
(dilemmas), let's take a quick look a what to use when she does the same to
you:

    @{b}GENETRONIC REPLICATOR@{ub}

    Event, uncommon.

Plays on table. prevents any of your Away Team members from being killed if
2 MEDICAL present.

@{i}"Medical device invented by Dr. Toby Russell. Capable of growing replacements
for damaged organs."@{ui}

This is one of those cards that caused lots of rules fuss, so I'll clarify it
first. It kicks in when:
- anything occurs that would kill a crewmember on a planet (not on a starbase
  or ship)
- two unaffected MEDICAL are present in the same away team.

The first one is quite clear, but the second one is a toughie. Basically, it
means you resolve the Diemma, Away Team battle or whatever and set aside the
to-be-killed card. Now you look at the rest and if it contains two MEDICAL
you get back whatever was set aside. If the rest does not include the two
docs, well bad luck.

This is quite versatile as you can supply the MEDICALs needed by any means of
your choice. So the use of OFFICER+Medical Kit or SCIENCE+Medical Tricorder
is perfectly OK for the purpose of this card.

The best point about it that an Away Team with three MEDICAL is immune to away
team battles as well as all of the following dilemmas: Armus, Chalnoth,
El-Adrel Creature, @{"Nausicaans" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD118"}, Rebel Encounter, Microvirus, @{"Archer" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD116"}. If two of
the MEDICAL have an Integrity of at least 5 (very desirable), the Genetronic
Replicator will even protect your crew against the dreaded Firestorm. However
it will NOT protect against @{"Love Interests" link COTD74} and Anaphasic Organism as these do
not say they "kill" an away team member. Unfortunately the Genetronic
Replicator is also completely useless against Space dilemmas.

Is there any defense against it? Yep. @{"Kev Ux" link COTD20} comes to mind first, but the
best defense is a good offense: Throw a @{"female love interest" link COTD74} and perhaps an
Anaphasic Organism in front of the Dilemma you really want to work. Also,
just add a mass killer like @{"Barclay's Disease" link COTD29} (Nobody unaffected, so nobody
there to save somebody).

Still, IMHO this card is a definite "must-have" in all decks that include 3 or
more planet missions.

Favorite combo(s):

- Genetronic Replicator + @{"Beverly Crusher" link COTD22}: a two-card life insurance.

Hi, folks,

it's dilemma time again...:

    @{b}CYTHERIANS@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space, rare.

    15 points.

Place on ship. Ship must do nothing but travel to far end of spaceline at
normal speed. When reached, discard dilemma. Score points.

@{i}"Race which explores the Galaxy by giving other species the temporary ability
and strong compulsion to come to them."@{ui}

This is IMHO the best space Dilemma. First, you can't get around it. Nope.
Nothing can neutralize this card. Not even stuff like @{"Genetronic Replicators" link COTD46}
or other dilemma-blasters will help you here.

Second, it has a great effect. At best, the victim of this needs three turns
to get to the other end and three more to return. Thus a crew is effectively
out of play for at least four turns (if the player sets up a ship chain to
transport everybody back).
But why stop here? Throw in one of the ship-damaging event cards and watch
her crawl along at speed five. Better yet, spice up the Cytherians Dilemma
with a Birth of Junior. The ship loses one Range each turn and cannot beam
anybody aboard to help.
If you want to go for a kill, try REM Fatigue Hallucinations - how is THAT
crew gonna return to the outpost in three turns?

Of course, this card has two drawbacks: First, it's a space only dilemma. Hate
that. So many people play lotsa planets. Second, your opponent gets those 15
points. (Of course, she'd gotten much more had she kept her crew active...)
The latter one can of course be turned into advantage... Seed it last under
your own mission, send Ensign Chump with a Runabout, let him gather 15 easy
points, complete the mission with the rest of the crew.

Favorite combo(s):

- Birth of Junior + Cytherians, if she doesn't have the ENGINEERs, she's
  dead with all hands aboard!

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #48@{ub}

Hi, folks,

before I go on with my own list, I quickly fulfill a request:

    @{b}STATIC WARP BUBBLE@{ub}

    Event, common.

Plays on table. Opponent must discard one card before ending each turn.
(Not cumulative.)

@{i}"@{"Dr. Beverly Crusher" link COTD22} experienced a shrinking univers, shaped by her own
thoughts, inside a static warp bubble created by @{"Ensign Wesley Crusher" link COTD26}."@{ui}

Yup, another card for a "Wrath of @{"Wesley Crusher" link COTD26}" deck. (In both ways, thema-
tically and because it's in my winning decks :-) ). It's close to a killer
when you get it out early. By just being in play for long enough, this card
will eliminate all choice your opponent could make about card play, as she
will be forced to discard down to the point where her hand would consist of
only one card (the one drawn last turn). Especially against those tourney
decks with only 30 draw deck cards and 30 seed cards (for speed, gets you
the good cards faster), this will prove devastating as these decks have very
little room for duplication, so even two or three discards might disrupt a
carefully planned strategy.

Of course this card has weaknesses, too. First it can be countered with two
different cards @{"Kev Ux" link COTD20} and @{"Traveller" link COTD4}), of which the latter is a formidable
card in itself and won't be missing in too many decks. Note though, that the
@{"Traveller" link COTD4} does NOT cause the SWB to discard but just negates it, so by @{"Ux'ing" link COTD20}
the @{"Traveller" link COTD4} you will get the effect back (and probably hit a good handful
of cards along the way).

Secondly, even if you get it out on your first turn and it remains uncoun-
tered, your opponent might have a @{"red alert" link COTD6} and play all his personnel on the
following turn, so you don't get to nail more than one card. Also, playing
SWB early loses you a precious early-game turn if you also have a few positive
events like @{"Traveller" link COTD4}, @{"Kivas" link COTD49} or @{"Red Alert" link COTD6} on your hand. Still, the last
argument doesn't hold too well as your opponent is slowed even worse by lo-
sing cards (assumed it works, of course.)

Favorite combo(s):

- Static Warp Bubble + Q2: Nail her @{"Kevin" link COTD20} AND her hand cards.

- Static Warp Bubble + Nanites + @{"Wesley Crusher" link COTD26}: just for the theme deck
  department.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #49@{ub}

Hi, folks,

y'all asked for more events, so I'm gonna give you:

    @{b}KIVAS FAJO - COLLECTOR@{ub}

    Event, uncommon.

Choose any player to immediately draw three new cards from the top of their
draw deck. Discard event after use.

@{i}"Treacherous collector of one-of-a-kind antiquities. Once tried to add
@{"Lt. Commander Data" link COTD7} to his collection."@{ui}

One word to describe this card: useful. However, most players think that is
is just three more cards to add to your hand. True, that's its main function.
Of course, it has two massive disadvantages against the other card that lets
you draw three extra cards (@{"Betazoid Gift Box" link COTD9}). First, you lose a turn playing
it (not to be ignored; loss of a single card play can wreak havoc to some
strategies) and second you don't get to choose the cards. But then,
@{"Betazoid Gift Box" link COTD9} is an artifact...

This simple use of Kivas Fajo is best suited for the early stages of the game.
Especially with a small draw deck you stand a good chance to draw important
stuff like @{"Red Alert" link COTD6}, @{"Traveller" link COTD4} or @{"Static Warp Bubble" link COTD48} on turn 1 and play them
on the 2nd turn.

However, there are a few more things to do with Kivas. In later turns when you
have a lead in points, play it on the player whose draw deck is smallest, thus
eliminating three more turns in which somebody could dare to catch up to you.
A nasty but risky combo is Kivas + @{"Static Warp Bubble" link COTD48}. If you manage to get
your opponent down to one card by means of the @{"SWB" link COTD48}, just Kivas him for three
more discards. Of course, this might just give him the needed @{"Kev Ux" link COTD20} or
@{"Traveller" link COTD4} :-(.

For speed players, a single Kivas Fajo combined with a few @{"Palor Toffs" link COTD25} will
prove much more useful than just multiple Kivas Fajos, as those @{"Palors" link COTD25} are
always worth another Kivas but might be put to other uses should the need
arise - the cost in cards as well as in turns is identical.

Caveat: Be very careful about Kivas'ing yourself or anybody when you are
playing a fast deck and are behind in points - you easily might deny yourself
the extra turn(s) needed to catch up and win.

Bonus (just because I mentioned the two cards): @{"The Traveller" link COTD4} and @{"Red Alert" link COTD6}
complement each other and with a 30-card draw deck you stand good chances to
get both on the initial draw. When this happens, play the @{"Traveller" link COTD4} first -
you wind up with an extra card (check this out for yourself).

Favorite combo(s):

- Kivas Fajo + @{"Palor Toff" link COTD25}: Cards, cards, cards...

Hi, folks,

welcome to the gold jubilee edition of Card of the Day ! Of course, I will
celebrate this and so I have appended the poll results... (see followup)
Today's card ? Well, lets try...

    @{b}MATRIARCHAL SOCIETY@{ub}

    Dilemma, planet, uncommon.

Cannot get past unless at least two female Away Team members are present.

@{i}"The planet Angel One was dominated by its women who were intolerant of
dealing with men."@{ui}

Oops, finally a REALLY short card text. So what about it ? It's one of the
rarer "persistent" dilemmas, and amongst those one of the strongest as it
offers quite a few opportunities to strengthen it. Its effect is simple but
powerful. If it kicks in, the opponent is stopped and denied from ever
solving this particular mission until he brings in reinforcements.

So, as with many things you can use this in two fashions.

First way to place it is seeding it first, so it will come up last. Before
it, you can then throw @{"Female Love Interest" link COTD74} and any of the "Opponent's
choice" dilemmas (for convenience: Chalnoth and Microvirus.) Or use an
Anaphasic Organism which has the advantage that is immune to @{"Genetronic Replicator" link COTD46}.
So with all these, matriarchal Society effectively no longer reads
"two females" but "three females, MEDICAL, SECURITY and  STRENGTH > 40". Ouch!

Well, of course you can also seed it first and place some "Kill everybody"
Dilemmas behind it. The first will disable redshirt attempts and the second,
R.I.P. ! For the fun of it, a @{"Barclay's Disease" link COTD29} is much better here than a
@{"Crystalline Entity" link COTD52} as the latter requires no SECURITY which is quite uncommon
amongst females whereas SCIENCE and MEDICAL are typical female skills.

What ? You ask why you should put all these Dilemmas under one mission?
C'mon, I told you, FAST decks have 6 Missions, 1 Outpost, 2 Artifacts and
21 Dilemmas just to keep your draw stack down to 30. So you can average
a whopping 3.5 Dilemmas for each mission of your opponent.

Favorite combo(s):

- @{"Female's Love Interest" link COTD74} + Matriarchal Society: Make that THREE !

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #51@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's a killer for ya:

    @{b}NAGILUM@{ub}

    Dilemma, space, rare.

    5 points

Half of crew is killed (random selection, round down) unless 3 Diplomacy OR
STRENGTH>40 aboard. Discard dilemma.

@{i}"Extra-dimensional entity willing to kill in order to understand the concept
of mortality."@{ui}

This is one of the very few powerful space-only dilemmas and as such a staple
in many decks although it is more an average than a great card. Its effect is
unique in the game so far as it is placed between the few kill-all dilemmas
and the numerous kill/disable/discard-one cards. However, IMHO the results
place it very close to the all-around killers insofar that the opponent will
in most cases be forced to abandon the mission and take time to recover. He
will just have the chance to recover a little faster.

The conditions to avoid the dilemma consist of one hard to meet requirement
(3 Diplomacy; almost impossible unless playing Feds) and an easy STRENGTH
threshold of 40 (Just bring any sufficiently large crew). As it is enough to
satisfy ONE of these conditions the Diplomacy requirement tends to have
little if any effect in play. (@{"Data" link COTD7} and @{"Worf" link COTD35} alone have a STRENGTH of 22, add
@{"Picard" link COTD1} to get your three Diplomacy and you have 28. The remaining 13 points
will easily be contributed by the needed ENGINEER, SCIENCE and MEDICAL unless
the player uses @{"Vekor" link COTD37} or Dr. Reyga. So even a Fed crew is pretty safe...)

Also, Nagilum tends to be pretty hard to combine with other Dilemmas. Well,
play an Ancient Computer after it and hope Nagilum does his work or try
Nitrium Metal Parasites. Even worse are the possibilities to prepare for
Nagilum. There isn't a single Space Dilemma that lets you get rid of a single
cremember at a time, much less do so with opponent's selection. The best
way to play it is to place it under an easy mission and hope the opponent is
stupid enough to rush in with little personnel. Note also that it is absolute-
ly safe to redshirt Nagilum! 1/2 killed crewmember, rounded down just isn't
THAT big a loss :-).

In tournaments Nagilum will probably be considered a sideboard card for oppo-
nents trying to play a space-mission strategy. In friendly, low- to mid-level
(sub-COTD) play it can be considered a must in every deck; there are just too
many people falling for such stuff... But whom do I tell this, regular COTD
readers are immune to such primitive traps.

Favorite combo(s):

- This card lacks obvious combos. I tend to combine it with whatever is left
  over after I built my other Dilemma stacks.

Hi, folks,

this will be the last Dilemma for some time:

    @{b}CRYSTALLINE ENTITY@{ub}

    Dilemma, Either, rare.

    5 points.

Space mission: kills all life on ship unless SHIELDS>6 OR Music aboard.
Planet mission: kills entire Away Team unless SCIENCE and MEDICAL present.
Discard Dilemma.

@{i}"Spaceborne life-form strips biological energy from planets and ships. Sensi-
tive to modulation much like crystal can shatter from a high pitch note."@{ui}

This is one of the more flexible Dilemmas. And nice in the aspect that it is
different for planet and space locations.

The effect is simple: Kills everybody, regardless where it's placed. However,
the prerequisites for overcoming are vastly different.

In space, this is trivial, Most space missions are attempted by large ships
anyway (or directly from the outpost) and in both cases, SHIELDS will be more
than 6. The Music solution is more suitable for those cases where you have
scanned a location and want to go in with a small crew in a shuttle (say it's
the only dilemma there).

On planets, this acts as a somewhat downgraded @{"Barclay's Protomorphosis disease" link COTD29}.
It actually is the same thing, just without the SECURITY requirement.
Of course, this combines well with the women-killers (@{"Female's Love Interest" link COTD74}
etc.) and the opponent's choice Dilemmas.

However there is a third use for this card: Seed it under a space mission and
solve it yourself, almost on the fly-by. 5 easy points without losing a turn,
makes it an improved @{"Sarjenka" link COTD45}.

Favorite combo(s):

- Crystalline Entity + @{"Female's love interest" link COTD74} + Anaphasic Organism: You know
  why.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #53@{ub}

Hi, folks,

I HAVE MY WARP PACK ! So let's celebrate this with:

    @{b}YELLOW ALERT@{ub}

    Event, common AU/WP.

Plays on table. While in play cancels (discard) and prevents @{"Red Alerts" link COTD6} AND
all your Personnel are each CUNNING + 1 (Not cumulative.)

@{i}"State of increased readiness and watchfulness. Declared by a captain in
anticipation of danger or when a crisis situation has lessened."@{ui}

OK, this has two facets. The first one is nice if you can't seem to get your
personnel out, the second one is great if you have them on the table.
Of course, fast decks have more problems with the first part than they can
gain from the second. But let's get systematical.

1: Cancel and prevent all @{"Red Alerts" link COTD6} (both sides). This slows down the game
a LOT. IMHO, Decipher hasn't done the game a service with this card, as the
problem with the boring first turns will become much worse if anybody gets
this into play early. On the other hand, now weaker decks have a somewhat
better chance of standing against tournament-level speed decks. (It would
have been a great idea to allow both sides to play TWO personnel each turn
with Y.A. out. This would also better fit the explanation of Yellow
Alert in the TNG Tech manual where two shifts of personnel are on duty
compared to one in normal flight and three during Red Alert.)

However, this card becomes GREAT, but worsens the imbalancing effect of
@{"Red Alert" link COTD6} if you play @{"R.A." link COTD6}, drop a handful of personnel and then the Yellow
Alert thereby securing your early advantage. Your opponent will need a
@{"Kev Ux" link COTD20} just to get back into the game if you can play like this.

2: Increase all Personnel's CUNNING by 1. Hey, that's nice. Although, which
of the really good missions need CUNNING ? Not that many, and most of them
are multi-affiliated and thus not so interesting for high-level play.

Final result: A GREAT card for beginners, however its usefulness vastly de-
clines with your playing skill and the number of cards you have to choose
from. Expect to see LOTS of them against you, but seriously consider advan-
tages and disadvantages before including it in your play deck.


Favorite combo(s):

- Sorry none yet. Still have to playtest this card some more. The RA/YA
  combo is just TOO rare to be a favorite.

HONORABLE MENTION: Michael Love !

The first non-god (non-Habib:-) ) to answer my little riddle right.

The answer is: @{"Wesley's" link COTD26} ENGINEERING is immune to the @{"Tsiolkovsky infection" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD128"},
as it is not listed in the first position. This makes him quite unique among
all personnel as most of them have their most valuable skill in the first
place. He has his LEAST useful skill there. (Bok is a similar exception.)

This fits nicely with "The naked now" where @{"Wes" link COTD26} was the only one to summon
enough brain to think up an Engineering solution to the asteroid problem.

Q'aPlaH !

Ouch, somehow I must have swapped yesterday's and today's posting, but these
two are just TOO similar, because today's is:

    @{b}LURSA@{ub}

    Personnel, Klingon, rare.

    Integrity 2
    Cunning 8
    Strength 8

    V.I.P., Treachery, Leadership, Geology, Greed, Command Star (*)

@{i}"Elder of the two Duras sisters. Plotted with Romulan @{"Sela" link COTD23} to start the
Klingon Civil War of 2367-68."

OK, quick analysis: Four skills. Thereof one really useless (Greed, nobody
needs THAT). One at best Mediocre (Geology). One OK (Treachery). One Good
(Leadership). Eighteen ability points, a tad above average. Bad distribution,
however. (Integrity 2 sux.) VIP classification. Ho-hum. @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13},
anybody? Otherwise: Forget it. (Unless they some day realize my card idea: VIP
transport, then this could be worth something...) A command star. Well.

Do these skills combine well? No. Treachery + Leadership is part of the
requirements for Pegasus search, but beyond ? No other mission will make use
of two of her skills, only one at a time.

So what's the result? A nice support card. Strength, Cunning and often a
single fitting skill. However, not more. On the other hand, only two Klingon
cards besides her have four skills. And only one (@{"her sister" link COTD55}) has five. Of
course, @{"Kurn" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD114"} and @{"Kurak" link COTD76} do have better skills.

Final evaluation: Medium-powered Klingon, but still valuable if just for lack
of better cards...

it's a Klingon today:

    @{b}B'ETOR@{ub}

    Personnel, Klingon, rare.

    Integrity 2
    Cunning 8
    Strength 7

    V.I.P., Treachery, Leadership, Physics, Greed, Youth, Command Star (*)

@{i}"Plotted with @{"Lursa" link COTD54} to seize power from @{"Gowron" link COTD5} with the support of the
Romulans. Younger of the two Duras sisters. The pretty one."


Well, at last a pretty female. Hey, we didn't have one since when ? Deanna ?
No, I was asking about PRETTY ones... Must be even longer.
OK, but who am I to judge the artwork, my job is to review the game effects
of the cards.  So I guess I'll do just that.

What do we get for our money here ? Let's start with the less useful things.
Greed, for example. Doesn't help. Youth. Not that much better, although quite
uncommon amongst Klingons (I counted 5). Physics. Nice for a few missions,
most of them Space stuff. (Notable exception: @{"Relief Mission" link COTD64}, quick 20
points) Leadership and Treachery. Both relatively common among Klingons,
compared to the other affiliations. But both very useful. That stuff comes
in handy for a Pegasus Search and for quite a few missions that require
multiple Treachery. The V.I.P. classification serves for nothing. Well except
for @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13}, but there are V.I.P.'s galore amongst those red cards.
Civilians are more of a problem.

Cunning and Strength are way above average, however Integrity sucks. Even if
we some day got an Integrity enhancer analog to the Phasers and Padd's (+2) we
will still be stuck 1 point low for Firestorm.

Facit: Not a "must have" card, but still one of the better Klingons. But
anyway Klingons are an affiliation almost unplayable without some serious
non-aligned support. They have lousy Medicals, weak Engineers and only two of
their Officers have more than two skills. Bearing this in mind, B'Etor's
4 1/2 skills (well, Greed is currently useless, so 1/2) really do stand out.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #56@{ub}

Hi, folks,

opinions differ quite a bit about today's card, but see for yourself:

    @{b}EXOCOMP@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, uncommon.

    Integrity 9
    Cunning 8
    Strength 1

    If aboard ship, can repair damage in two of your full truns, without
    returning to outpost. ENGINEER. Universal.

@{i}"Sentient artificial life-form incorporating an advanced microreplication sys-
tem. Specializes in repair tasks. Servomechanism designed by Dr. Farallon."@{ui}


This is the first card we have with a very specialized skill. (Hope we see
more of them in the future, however.) Besides being an ENGINEER with great
INTEGRITY and CUNNING and the (sometimes very important) fact that this card
in not affected by @{"Love interests" link COTD74}, diseases, and similarily nasty stuff, we
also get a special ability: The ability to repair a damaged ship.

What is this good for? Well, not for battle. It is WAY too slow to work in
battle, as it needs two full turns to work and we can spare only one. However,
it is great against those "nuisance" dilemmas and interrupts. Auto-Destruct,
Null space, Nanites, Gravitic Mine and Microbiotic Colony all damage ships
only once, so there is no need for an immediate repair. But the time spent
returning to an outpost, waiting two turns and coming back to whatever I
want to do is way too long. By the time I get my ship back into action, I can
easily have lost the game against a fast deck. This is where Exocomp kicks
in. The most I'll lose of this is 2x4 Range points (if my damaged ship was the
@{"Enterprise" link COTD3} or something similarily fast).

Although this might translate into more than 8 movement points lost (let's say
the sequence I want to bridge is 2-4-3-4-3-2-5-4, figure that one out for
yourself - it is the worst case!) this loss is still sustainable. And in most
cases, I don't even want to move immediately. Most ship damage will come from
Dilemmas, (there are just more Dilemmas that do it than other cards) and thus
I will just be wanting to continue my mission attempt. In this case I can just
go on and have the repairs as a side effect.

Hint: in rare occasions, it is even possible to repair battle damage if you
are willing to flee and you have a Transwarp Conduit, Distortion of Space/Time
Continuum, Temporal Rift or @{"Time Travel Pod" link COTD14}. The former two will only
work, if your opponent has a ship with range 7 or less, however and if span
constellations work in your favor. You are well advised to calculate your
escape route before attempting this.

Hi, folks,

ya waiting for a ROMULAN ? Gee, that's just what I wanted to do...:

    @{b}MIROK@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan, uncommon.

    Integrity 3
    Cunning 8
    Strength 7

    SCIENCE, ENGINEER, Astrophysics, Physics, Staff Star (+).

@{i}"Scientist in charge of developing and testing the @{"Interphase generator" link COTD15} in
2368."@{ui}

IMHO, this one is better than @{"Sela" link COTD23} or any other Romulan. Not only does he
have a dual classification, but two rather useful skills as well. SCIENCE
and ENGINEER nicely fit each other, there are a few Dilemmas that require
both. Astrophysics can be used with four of the Romulan missions, two of
them being Romulan only and one even requiring TWO of this skill. Physics
fits only one of the Romulan missions, but try this in a surprise espio-
nage deck (try heaping point Dilemmas under an opponent's mission then
attempt it yourself with an espionage card.) He comes in handy for this
strategy, as he will not only supply ENGINEER, SCIENCE, Cunning and Strength
towards the dilemmas but can help snatch the mission away with the Physics,
too.

Best suited for space missions, however. Those Firestorms suck and there aren't
that many planet missions with Astrophysics...


Favorite combo(s):

- Try this once: Mirok + @{"Vekor" link COTD37} + @{"Roga Danar" link COTD18}. Under opponent's space mission
  (I prefer Survey Mission, but that's a matter of taste), seed:
  @{"Barclay's disease" link COTD29} [10], @{"Crystalline Entity" link COTD52} [5], Nanites [5],
  Cosmic String Fragment [5], @{"Tarellian Plague Ship" link COTD35} [5], @{"Sarjenka" link COTD45} [5].
  35 Points for almost free. No risk involved. Add to it a Dr. Reyga,
  Romulan PADD and @{"Temporal causality loop" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD124"} [5] and complete the mission on your
  next turn. 75 points with just four personnel !!!!!

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #58@{ub}

Hi, folks,

it seems everybody is on holiday, at least most of my raters are...
So I had to delay this issue a little bit in order to give you at
least a few ratings to go with this Warp Pack card:

    @{b}COUNTERMANDA@{ub}
    Interrupt, common AU/WP.

Nullifies Telepathic Alien Kidnappers OR if opponent just played Res-Q or
Palor Toff, suspend that action, look through opponent's discard pile and
put any three cards out-of-play.

@{i}"A Federation student intern when she discovered her true identity as a Q,
Amanda took a dim view of the over-manipulative use of power upon other
species."@{ui}

This card was obviously designed to be a catch-all combo counter. Besides
the clumsy name (which doesn't sound Trek-like at all) it weakens or
nullifies the key cards in two of the most annoying STCCG combos, which
are the Alien Probe/TAK and the Palor Toff/Betazoid Gift Box combo.

It also introduces a few new rules, namely the concept of having cards
out-of-play and suspending an interrupt action, the former of which has been
suggested by Decipher earlier on concerning mis-seeded artifacts.

For a card designed to help beginners play better it is IMHO way too complex
to understand and use. Actually this is a card that requires lots of playing
skill to use correctly.

Although Countermanda is definitely inferior to Kev Uxbridge in terms of
overall power, it has several advantages. First of all, she is not
vulnerable to Q2, but to Amanda Rogers. An opponent will think twice before
wasting an Amanda on this card, whereas Q2's are often played without second
thoughts as their scope is much more limited. Secondly, Countermanda is the
only card to completely deny your opponent the further use of a card, all
others leave chances of regrowth. Third, it can essentially counter any
regrowth attempt.

Another not-so-obvious advantage applies when playing restricted decks
(not more than * of one card in each deck), especially if that * means 1.
You can add a Countermanda to these decks in order to save yourself a
valuable Kevin when countering a TAK or Res-Q.

The main problem with this card occurs when using it to remove cards from
the discard pile. The choice which cards to remove is one of the most
difficult to make in the entire game, unless you see a game-breaking card
right away. Fortunately you are allowed some margin of error in this
decision by being allowed to remove three cards. Still however, beginners
will have a tough time using this card until they are really familiar with
strategies and deck design.

Final evaluation: This is a card that is very limited and incredibly
versatile at the same time. In the hands of an experienced player it can
be devastating or at least very annoying. In the hands of a beginner, it
is not that strong, as the extra choice in this card is hard to make. A
definite YES for all restricted decks, as long as the restriction is 1 or
2. I am not that sure about using her in unrestricted decks, when I can
have 4 Kevins and 2 or 3 Amandas instead.

Favorite combo(s):

- I don't see any power combo yet. However, to back this card you need
a Q2 instead of an Amanda (Countermanda, countered by Amanda, the latter
countered by Q2), which can increase the value of your Q2's.

Hi, folks,

I hope this finally arrives at your terminal, this is the 3rd try as about
everything is screwed up at our place...
We could really use a Miracle Worker here which leads right to today's card:

    @{b}MONTGOMERY SCOTT@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, common AU/WP.

    Integrity 7
    Cunning 8
    Strength 3

    ENGINEER x 2, Astrophysics, Honor, Miracle Worker, Command Star (*).


This is a common with the stats of a $30 rare. In the whole game, the only
card that is close to equal is good ole @{"Geordi" link COTD32}. Even better, Scott has Honor
which is an uncommon but very useful skill. Also, Astrophysics seems somewhat
better than regular Physics. The only disadvantage is that Miracle Worker
is not (yet) used anywhere.

As far as stats are concerned, the two important stats (Integrity and Cunning)
are quite high, only Strength is a little on the low side, but this is the
least important attribute as long as there aren't too many away team battles.

Scotty is also a very versatile card, neither slanted too much towards space
missions (Honor is much more useful on planets) not towards planet missions
(Astrophysics is space-oriented). So, especially for a planet-mission deck,
Scotty makes a more than fair substitute for a @{"Geordi" link COTD32}, even if you do play
"Evaluate Terraforming", as the latter can also be solved with a
@{"Beverly Crusher" link COTD22} alone.

With a card or two that need Miracle worker, Scotty might easily become the
second or third best Federation card. He's already a top ten card without
counting it! (For those who still remember the skill->points conversion,
[I mentioned that when doing Vekor, I believe, so look it up there...]
our Scotty has a total of 58 right now and every "Miracle Worker" require-
ment on a mission would add 10 more to it [provided there aren't any more
Miracle Workers out there]. For comparison: @{"Geordi" link COTD32} is a 70 pts card, @{"Bev" link COTD22} is 78
and @{"Data" link COTD7} is 92. On the other end, @{"Mot" link COTD24} is a meager 15...)


Favorite combo(s):

- Scotty, @{"Geordi" link COTD32} and @{"Nutational Shields" link COTD40}... 3 cards, 8 Shields!

Hi, folks,

let's take a look at a card that isn't that bad as some people think it is:

    @{b}PI@{ub}

    Ship, Romulan, rare.

    Range 9
    Weapons 4
    Shields 4

    No command requirements.

@{i}"Ship suspected of attempting a covert mission to Galorndon Core in Fede-
ration territory."@{ui}


This is the fastest ship you can ever get without stuffing several command
crew in. However, the low shield and weapon rating can get you into some
trouble. Shields of 4 just fall short of making it through a loss of orbital
stability and Weapons of 4 can safely be ignored unless you try to assemble
an armada at your outpost in order to destroy a @{"Borg Ship" link COTD2}. However, there
are the Shield enhancer cards which come in very handy even if you cannot
afford to put more than one Engineer or Science aboard the ship. Just one
single +2 bonus protects you from the above mentioned Loss of Orbital Stability
disaster and also makes direct hits even from @{"Bynar-enhanced" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD197"} ships
impossible (the latter doesn't hold true for the basic Scout ship).

Now some will say that the 8/5/6 Science vessel is even better. Just on the
other hand, think of those 4/5 or 3/3/3 or 3/2/4 span combinations, they are
not that uncommon and very annoying!!!


Favorite combo(s):

- Pi + Science Vessels for a quick daisy chain along the spaceline.

Seed one at any Space location OR build later at a Space location where any
ENGINEER is present. No repairs here.

@{i}"A common space station design used by many races for research or trade.
Personnel and ships from all affiliations are frequent visitors at such
facilities."@{ui}

Now what can we do with this ? At least we can play with it, and the card
actually has a use. Of course, when you own the affiliated outposts, this
card is only useful when you are playing multicolor decks. For these cases,
seeding one would be futile (you don't get to seed the affiliated cards), but
keeping one as a backup would be a very valid strategy, as you could use it
to quickly shift a few personnel to whatever affiliation you just want to
reinforce right now. Enhance it with a spacedock and you'll have a versatile
backup outpost for whatever you need it for. Especially those decks that
play dual affiliation without relying on a treaty card can benefit from having
a Neutral Outpost, but these are more on the fun side than being serious "kill
anything" stuff.

I will use this in my all-purpose Klingon/Federation deck, the one designed
to give your opponent fun in play while still winning 75-80% of the games
played with it... In those ten-turn-crush-everybody-hundred-nil bom'bs, there
won't be a card slot for stuff like this.

Favorite combo(s):

- None, I am not really a beginner anymore :-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #62@{ub}

Hi, folks,

some of you have requested I review some Missions. MISSIONS ??? Aren't they
all the same ??? Well, I tried my best to pick a few not so standard ones
and I promise to do my best. Anyone not in favor of this idea, quit now and
come back for @{"#67" link COTD67}...
For the rest, here comes a worthy beginning (and the proof that not ALL
missions are the same :-) )

    @{b}HUNT FOR DNA PROGRAM@{ub}

    Mission, Fed/Klin/Rom, planet, rare.

    55 points, Span 5.

    Archaeology x 3 + Computer Skill + Biology + Leadership + STRENGTH > 40.

@{i}"Vilmor II: Seek and secure last strand of DNA program on this desert planet."@{ui}

This is the largest point source in the whole game, and also the one with the
most requirements and it has (besides others) the largest span available.
Let's first try to assemble the smallest crew that can solve this:

@{"Jean-Luc Picard" link COTD1}         Archaeology, Leadership, Strength 6.
Baran                   Archaeology, Computer Skill, Strength 6.
@{"Roga Danar" link COTD18}              Biology, Strength 12.
@{"Ocett" link COTD80}                   Archaeology, Strength 6.
@{"Data" link COTD7}                    Strength 12.
------------------------------------
Total Strength: 42. One more than needed.

(Anyone who can do this mission with FOUR cards, please mail me. Of course
you can do with four CREW if you have two phasers, but that makes 6 cards...)

Klingon players can substitute a @{"Gowron" link COTD5} and a Koral for @{"Picard" link COTD1} and @{"Data" link COTD7}
(Str 43 total), Romulans can use Taul and Tomalak (Str 41).

So at least this mission is balanced, everybody needs five crew, nobody can
do with less. All three crew consist of four universally usable members, only
Baran sucks a little, so once you get this together you might as well solve a
few other missions, too (or instead).

Note that in all three crews it is very hard to replace one of the five
personnel and still have all skills and attributes, so any strategy relying on
this mission is vulnerable. This and the fact that it easily can be snatched
by your opponent when she gets the necessary crew first make this card a risky
proposition. I prefer two single-affiliation missions instead to make 60 or
65 points and gain TWO artifacts along the way...

However, this mission makes for a great bluff. Seed it and grin widely. Pretty
sure, your opponent will put her best Dilemmas underneath in order to stop you
from gaining 55 points - which you smilingly counter by flying the opposite
direction and solving three 35 point missions that don't have anything hard
underneath as everything is placed you-know-where....

Favorite combo(s):

- Well more like best Dilemmas: Try spicing this mission with Alien Abduction
  (against Feds, steal @{"Data" link COTD7}, any @{"love interest" link COTD74} (5 crew necessary, good
  chance to nail at least one) or anything that requires MEDICAL (preferably
  more than once).
- No good: Anything that requires [Attribute] > *. Crews for this mission are
  LARGE!

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #63@{ub}

Hi, folks,

after my little (unvoluntary) sabbatical, here's what y'all are waiting for:

    @{b}INVESTIGATE SIGHTING@{ub}

    Mission, Fed/Rom, Space, 35 points, Span 4.

    Empathy x 3 OR Treachery + Exobiology + CUNNING > 40

@{i}"Beta Stromgen: Investigate sighting of Gomtuu, an interstellar creature
code-named Tin Man."@{ui}


This is a not-so-balanced card. The Federation can overcome this mission with
only two crew (e.g. Tam Elbrun + Lwaxana Troi), whilst the Rommies won't get
more than ONE Empathy, even with Non-aligned support. So they will have to go
for the second solution. @{"Mendak" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD113"} is good choice for them (both skills), but
we will then need two crewmembers with a CUNNING of 9 to meet the 41 limit.
@{"Sela" link COTD23} is one, and the other candidate would be Dr. Reyga or Bok. Add any two
crew with CUNNING 8 and you will be able to solve this mission with 5 cards.
Not really the best point/card ratio considering that five Rommies can also
do @{"Hunt for DNA program" link COTD62}. (BTW:I've recieved a beautiful 4-card solution to
that mission, but it's Federation only... see below)

Now let's try the second way to solve the mission for the Federation...
Exobiology and Cunning really screams "@{"Data" link COTD7}", so let's include him.
@{"Sarek" link COTD72} will supply 10 more Cunning, Bok nets another 9 and Treachery and I complete
the crew with @{"Albert Einstein" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD110"} or Isaac Newton. 4 cards. (Almost all Fed ships
have Holodecks and this is a space mission, so no problem here.)

The problem with this mission? Well, all the easy solutions require the
inclusion of an otherwise relatively weak card or cards. The Scientist Holos
are no regulars in most decks and Empaths are our favorite hated cards.
Only the Rommie solution seems a little more flexible, but then it needs a
lot of cards for not so many points and this mission can be "stolen" by
another affiliation.

Quick Facit: NAH. There are better cards.

Hi, folks,

We've seen the hardest, we've seen the worst, let's now see the easiest:

    @{b}RELIEF MISSION@{ub}

    Mission, Kli/Rom, Planet, 20 points, Span 2.

    Geology OR Physics.

@{i}"Penthara IV: Alleviate planet of Ice Age conditions following Type-C asteroid
impact."@{ui}


Ok, quick, everybody tell me the one thing that this card a good card.
Got it?
Easy: it's a planet mission.
What? That should be it?
Yep. This is not a mission to solve for points (although this is a nice side
effect), it is an excuse for a Romulan or Klingon player to seed an artifact.
With just one each of MEDICAL, SCIENCE, SECURITY and ENGINEER you can be
reasonably sure to solve it (+dilemmas) and get a speed advantage over your
opponent - provided of course you seed your outpost there. (I prefer placing
a @{"Betazoid Gift Box" link COTD9} underneath, but that is solely a matter of taste...)

The very same card as a space mission would be total crap. For points, you
will need an average of 33.3 to win with three missions only. As you cannot
count on getting Dilemma points, you will usually try to get two 35's and
a 30 or two 30's and one 40. A 20 point mission would require two more hard
40's so forget this point-wise.

Unless, of course, you use it strategically as "half a mission". If you then
strategically place a @{"Cytherians" link COTD47} somewhere you can trigger it with a small
ship (Rommies, use your Science ships) and send the poor redshirt away to
cash your 15 points. Net result: 35 (Almost for free...)

Hi, folks,

another mission awaits us, so let's plunge right in:

    @{b}STUDY STELLAR COLLISION@{ub}

    Mission, Fed/Kli/Rom, Space, 25 points, Span 3

    Stellar Cartography

@{i}"Detrian System: Study rare collision between two gas giants."@{ui}


Do they come any worse ? This card is one of the examples how a mission
should not be done. Granted, it's a common, so we can't expect too much,
but it is even feeble for a common. This mission is only good for the player
who plays against it. Either he places lots of hard dilemmas underneath
(and thus makes it worthless for his opponent, as a crew large enough
to solve the dilemmas can do about any mission) or he plays little dilemmas
and places his outpost there for 25 easy points (This thingy is triple-
affiliation :-( )

The only way to play this is if you place some dilemmas there yourself. But
I think there are better uses for dilemmas.

Now everybody says :"wait a sec, that's almost the same thing as
@{"Relief Mission" Link COTD64}" and you're ALMOST right. But @{"relief mission" link COTD64} has
two features: It is a planet mission and it cannot be done by Feds. This
makes the latter an acceptable card, but the former isn't. Nah. Out of

Hi, folks,

probably the most unanimously viewed card we've ever seen:

    @{b}DIPLOMACY MISSION@{ub}

    Mission, Fed, Planet, 30 Points, Span 3

    Diplomacy + INTEGRITY > 30 + CUNNING > 30.

@{i}"Peliar Zel: Mediate dispute between civilizations on Peliar Zel's two moons"@{ui}


A really mediocre card. Some of my reviewers barnded it an endgame card. I'd
rather say it's a typical midgame mission. Not easy enough to be attempted
with one or two personnel, but fair game for almost any crew involving four
bridge crew cards. Obviously, the minimum crew is 4 cards (nobody has
INTEGRITY of 10 or more), but with exactly four there are plenty of choices.
Include @{"Picard" link COTD1} or @{"Sarek" link COTD72} and you can even substitute an Integrity 6 for your
4th card.

The point per card ratio is not too good (7.5), but with the flexibility of
crew choice, the chance to seed an artifact and the fact that a Klingon or
Romulan opponent cannot easily snatch this one away, this mission cannot be
described other than "balanced." If more cards would be like this, the game
would be really fair (but really boring, too).

Hi, folks,

as I know you, you're probably fed up with missions right now. Good. So
let's get back to the interesting cards :-)

    @{b}N'VEK@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan, Uncommon

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 8
    Strength 8

    SCIENCE, Honor, Biology, Computer Skill, Command Star (*).

@{i}"Member of the Romulan underground. Spearheaded defection of Vice-Proconsul
M'ret to the Federation."@{ui}


A Romulan Mini-Data. Lotsa skills, good stats. Nice to have. Bye.
(Argh, where's the review???)
Don't panic. Some more detail:

Stats - good stuff and (rare!) evenly distributed. No particular weakness.
Proof against Firestorms and other nasty things. Worth something
significant towards all stat counting Dilemmas or Missions.

SCIENCE - Would not want to be without. So if you need one anyway, why not
          use a good one ?

Honor - Oops, what's this? A Romulan with honor ? Tsk, tsk, tsk... Enemies
        aren't what they once were. Nonetheless, useful. Try with an
        Espionage card against one of the better Fed or Klingon missions
        (Cloaked mission, nice surprise...). Or use him to aid
        Khitomer research...

Biology - Haven't we had this before ? Try with Espionage & Fever Emergency.

Computer Skill - Not to be missed. I heard about Impassable Doors turning up
                 against certain deck types, especially if a sideboard is
                 permitted...

Command ability - Just basically useful. Period.

    Interrupts, uncommon.

Your ship must immediately return to the nearest *** outpost, full speed.

@{i}"Messages and directives are sent, faster than light, on subspace radio sig-

(Yep, all 3 cards have the same boring flavor text :-( )


These cards are powerful. Play them in any stall deck, if you know what
affiliation your opponent is going to use. If not - try something else.

So much for the quick reader. In depth:
These cards, used correctly, are incredibly strong. Not only can you stall
an opponent for several turns, with a little calculation you can actually
use them destructively. Try for example two strategically placed
@{"subspace warp rifts" link COTD83}. The opponent MAY NOT stop there, so damage is assured. Two of
them: BOOM... Of course, this play requires several short span missions in
a row, as after the first hit, range is reduced to 5.

Gaps in normal space also is an option. In the right position - unstoppable
Mini-Armus(TM).

The biggest one however, is Incoming Message + @{"Q-Net" link COTD86}, a perfect lock unless
the opponent has 2 Diplomacy aboard. Remember, no beaming to or from the ship
is allowed if a ship is under the influence of one of these cards. So stick a
{"Q-Net" link COTD86} between the ship and the outpost and grin. Having no 2 Diplomacy, your
opponent wil sit there forever, never being able to complete the assignment.
Cure with @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link COTD20} on @{"Q-Net" link COTD86}, @{"Amanda" link COTD31} won't work anymore!
(There are three more solutions to this problem, but I won't tell yet. The
first reader to find ALL will get the usual honorable mention... One is easy
and requires only one card, the second one needs at least four cards and will
not be easy to implement in a game and the third is a two-card one, but who
plays them?)

Now for the drawback: You need to know what affiliation your opponent is
playing, otherwise you are stuck with a completely useless card. So for
fixed-deck play this card is relatively crap. If you are allowed to side-
board, however (evil cackle)...


Favorite combo(s):

- The Incoming Message / @{"Q-Net" link COTD86} lock. Really effective against Klingons and
  Rommies...

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #69@{ub}

Hi, folks,

Magic has (sorry: had) its Atog and ST:CCG didn't want to leave out the
chance to include an equally hated card:

    @{b}K'TESH@{ub}

    Personnel, Klingon, common.

    Integrity 5
    Cunning 5
    Strength 6

    ENGINEER, Stellar Cartography, Hologram, universal.

@{i}"Re-Creation who assisted in the Age of Ascension ritual. Perfected
current pain-stick design for ritual use."@{ui}


WHAT? A Klingon Hologram whose skills (sorry: skill) are useless on planet
missions? If I go all the way to carry @{"Holo-Projectors" link COTD69}, I want to use my
Holos on planets, too. And this one is not very useful on a planet (except
perhaps as a reusable redshirt, I will come back to this later).

Other ways to play a K'Tesh if I really want to? Two.

1) Play a Klingon / Federation Alliance. Holodecks galore, no need for that
   #&%$ @{"Holo-Projector" link COTD69}. Now he can be used in space where he is useful.

2) Use Husnock ships. Slow but powerful (see the review of that card).

Now if there only were a range enhancer card...

Alternatives ? One. Uncommon, though. Use Dr. Reyga. An extra SCIENCE, an
extra Astrophysics, and a Staff Star. Not universal though and he can be
killed...

Now that redshirt thing I talked about. Remember Holograms cannot be killed,
abducted, etc. They can only be deactivated. So if you really need to red-
shirt (no better ideas ?) use them. Holo #1 beam down, suck dilemma, get
deactivated and return to ship. Remainder of ship crew is still unstopped,
so send Holo #2, suck dilemma...
Repeat until all dilemmas are gone. Solve mission.
Works best for Romulans, as they have two not-so-useless common Holo cards,
but two or three K'Teshs can do the same trick.

Of course don't try this with me. A simple Holographic ruse or Shaka will
nullify this idea of yours and once your crew is down there... (grin)


Favorite combo(s):

- A Handful of K'Teshs as redshirts. There even is a lot of red on the card :-)

Hi, folks,

we didn't see a ship for some time, so let's fix this:

    @{b}I.K.C. PAGH@{ub}

    Ship, Klingon, rare.

    Range 8
    Weapons 7
    Shields 6

    Cloaking Device, Tractor Beam

    Requires 1 Staff (+)

@{i}"Battle cruiser under the command of Captain Kargan.
@{"Commander William T. Riker" link COTD19} served aboard as an exchange officer in 2365."@{ui}


A good ship for any Klingon Armada deck. With the one staff as only requirement,
you can man quite a few of these. Add a @{"Nutational shields" link COTD40} and a Kromm
and you have an Armada of 8/7/8's capable of blowing about everything out
of space with an investment of only 2 cards for each 7 firepower. A
@{"Bynar weapon enhancement" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD197"} makes this 8/9/8. (8/6/8 or 8/8/8 for each ship beyond
the 3rd, as you run out of non-universals). Still, blowing an opponent's
outpost to pieces with not more than 10 cards is a good value for money
relation...

Cloaking devices IMHO don't help very much and a Tractor beam... Well, let's
see what they give us in the expansions. At the moment the ship extras are
not that useful.


Favorite combo(s):

- Pagh + @{"Vorn" link COTD70a} + Hegh'ta + Buruk + 4 Kromms +

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #71@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's an Anti-stall card:

    GODDESS OF EMPATHY

    Event, rare.

Plays on table until the end of your next turn. Neither you nor your opponent
can play interrupt cards (except @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link COTD20} or Q2). Discard after use.

@{i}"Lt. Reginald Barclay created a fantasy holodeck simulation of
@{"Counselor Deanna Troi" link COTD39}. Her empathic abilities help other personnel aticipate danger."@{ui}


I didn't like this card very much. Actually I never played it until I've seen
Habib's stall deck. My deck is a speed deck and with a good buildup I can
score three missions in one turn, so this card gives me the room I need.

How to use:
Against a stall deck, you will have trouble the very moment you leave your
outpost to do anything. So just collect a crew there (A @{"Kivas Fajo" link COTD49} and a
few @{"Palors" link COTD25} help, as do the @{"Traveller" link COTD4} and @{"Red Alert" link COTD6}). You can solve the mission
at your outpost location, there is no way to counter this. (Good to have a
@{"Betazoid Gift Box" link COTD9} there) Now with two ships at your outpost, play
Goddess, solve one mission that MUST BE ADJACENT to your outpost location, fly
back, (that's why you need the close mission, otherwise you run out of range)
change ship, fly to other side, solve 3rd mission, win. Opponent cannot
stop you, as no interrupts are allowed and as it is not her turn, you won't need
to fear battle. Add a @{"Horga'hn" link COTD10} to the 2nd mission for extra safety (extra
turn). Remember, you are faster - a stalling opponent hurts her own speed.
(Hi Habib, wanna play against a slightly modified BLUE LIGHTNING?)

BIG CAVEAT: When trying this keep a Q2 as backup. Otherwise the staller
smiles and throws a @{"Kevin" link COTD20}. Remember, she cannot @{"Amanda" link COTD31} your Q2. (Goddess
prohibits this!)


Favorite combo(s):

- This is not a combo card, but a counter card. It is useful only as part of
  bigger strategies.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #72@{ub}

Hi, folks,

I would like to insert a bridge crew here, but somehow I ran out of cards.
(See the various reviews) So I guess we have to stick with the second
best:

    @{b}SAREK@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare.

    Integrity 9
    Cunning 10
    Strength 3

    V.I.P, Diplomacy x 3, Mindmeld, Command Star (*).

@{i}"Illustrious Vulcan Federation Ambassador. Over 200 years old. Married at
least three times: to a Vulcan Princess, to Amanda and to Perrin. Father of
Spock."@{ui}


Not only is he the one person with the highest INTEGRITY, he also is the most
CUNNING of all (biologically) living STCCG personnel. This alone makes him
valuable, but more important, he is a vital part of one of the best
crew/mission combinations. Take Wormhole negotiations as the mission,
and solve it with Sarek and @{"Picard" link COTD1} for a 22.5 average.
(of course you can improve on this: @{"Picard" link COTD1} + Excavation gets 25.0, @{"Wesley" link COTD26} +
Study Plasma Streamer gets you 30.0, same goes for @{"Deanna" link COTD39} + First Contact and
@{"Data" link COTD7} + @{"Investigate Time Continuum" link COTD97} goes up to 35.0. There is another 35.0
possibility, but I leave that one to you for the next honorable mention...)
[Gods explicitly excluded from this - It's TOO EASY]

Mindmeld is another point. With the corresponding interrupt, you can
create incredible two-card crews: How about Diplomacy x 7 , Leadership x 2,
Honor x 2 all with two personnel ?

Sarek is fun in another way, as he is a keystone of one of the few real
theme decks possible with the present cards: Sarek + @{"Picard" link COTD1} + Riva + whoever can
support the theme and a big lot of missions with a Diplomacy requirement
to make an Ambassador deck. Counting the related skill of Honor you can
build a deck full of Diplomat type characters (you will need to use a Med Kit to
supply a doc...) I'd suggest Wormhole negotiations, @{"Diplomacy mission" link COTD66},
First Contact, Evacuation, Investigate Massacre and Study "Hole in Space"
as mission choices.


Favorite combo(s):

- Sarek + @{"Picard" link COTD1} + Wormhole Negotiations. "What ? Only x5 ?".

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #73@{ub}

Hi, folks,

I've done reviews with one card, two cards and even three cards. So let's
try something really different: HALF A CARD. Huh ? Easy:

    @{b}WORMHOLE@{ub}

    Interrupt, common.

Requires two wormholes. Play one on any ship as it begins to move. Play
the other where the ship immediately emerges. Discard wormholes.

"An unstable tunnel through subspace that links to locations in normal
space / time."


Half a card. You may not even play it alone for no effect. It sits on your
hand until you can get another. Then you can relocate a single ship. If you
could at least use a single one to teleport a ship to a random location
(roll a twelve-sided die...) this were OK, but like this I really wonder what
to do with this card. You have a 75% chance that at least one of the two
needed is in the bottom half of the deck and still a 7 in 16 chance that you
get one of the two in the last quarter of your cards. If you use more than
two, they really start to clutter things up, so not much of an alternative
here, even more so as your opponent can destroy these two cards with a
single @{"Amanda Rogers" link COTD31} :-(

If you need speed, use Transwarp conduits instead. Two of these played on
a @{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3} give it a range of 36, enough to cover at least 75% of the
spaceline, even if she is stuck at the very end, and they can be used alone
for an 18 span move.

The only place where Wormholes might be effective are large multiplayer
games, but in the standard two-player version: DOH.


Favorite combo(s):

- Wormhole + Wormhole. Nice combo, eh ?

Hi, folks,

Guess I compensate for the half-card yesterday before somebody
complains about having paid for a full one...

    @{b}MALE'S LOVE INTEREST
    FEMALE'S LOVE INTEREST@{ub}

    Dilemmas, Planet, common.

*** Away team member (random selection) runs off with lover to furthest
planet, where (s)he remains. Can be rescued later. Discard dilemma.

@{i}"A genetically engineered leader. Once romantically involved with Deanna
Troi"
"One of the many beautiful women who reside on the paradise planet of
Risa"@{ui}
(Guess which is which...)


These cards are not as similar as they might seem, especially concerning
combo opportunities. The Female's version is definitely the stronger one, as
there is the @{"Matriarchal Society" link COTD50} (always a nice combo) and you can use this
against the typical Fed deck very well (Try FLI + any Dilemma requiring lots of
Medical & Science - almost all their blue shirts are female.) The MLI can some-
what be combined with dilemmas requiring Security, but this is far less
certain, as Tasha Yar can work around this problem. For MLI, there is the
combination with the impassable door (all the Computer freaks are men
except Dr. Selar, at least as far as Feds are concerned [too lazy to check the
other affiliations]).

Quick three-criteria analysis for those used to it:

Prerequisites: Strong. Cannot be avoided. By NO means. Not even
@{"Genetronic replicator" link COTD46} or @{"Interphase Generator" link COTD15} do help.

Effect: Medium to strong. Get rid of 1 personnel with some control over
which type goes. In most cases more lasting than killing, as no @{"Res-Q" link COTD28}
allowed.

Flexibility: Fair (MLI), Good (FLI). The extra killer combos for the FLI
merit the better rating. Planet Dilemmas are IMHO more useful than space
ones.

Total: Great cards. Must-haves.


Favorite combo(s):

- FLI + Anaphasic Organism + Matriarchal Socitey. 2? Make that 4.
- MLI + Microvirus + Impassable Door. Best All-common dilemma combo ever.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #75@{ub}

Hi, folks,

we've seen about everything in Card of the Day right now, but there
are lots of cards that just aren't interesting enough to be worth a
review of their own. So for this issue, let's take a bunch of them
and do an issue of

    @{b}75 CARDS THAT WILL NEVER BE IN CARD OF THE DAY@{ub}

@{b}1)  All Basic Outposts.@{ub} (3 cards)

    These are like Basic Lands in Magic. You need them. Period. Only
    point worth noting is the little compensation in the Federation
    Outpost with the two less shields, but I never saw this making a
    difference.

Rating: 9.9 each (much better than the neutral one)


@{b}2)  The Phasers / Disruptors / PADD's.@{ub} (6 cards)

    These are just weak. To make them better than an extra crewmember
    I would need to put them with at least 5 people. Otherwise I prefer
    adding a strong or cunning personnel and get not only attribute
    points but skills, too.

Rating: 1.5 for the STRENGTH enhancers
        1.0 for the CUNNING boosters

@{b}3)  The Kits / Tricorders / Engineering PADD.@{ub} (5 cards)

    The kits are somewhat useful as is the regular Tricorder. In most
    cases I have an abundance of OFFICERs, but too few MEDICAL and
    SCIENCE. Too bad you cannot use the granted skills as basis for
    other equipment, otherwise this might have been an interesting
    strategy (OFFICERs + Engineering Kit + Tricorder + Medical Tricorder)
    The two equipment that add to the SCIENCE personnel are redundant
    for me - I am always short on Science.

Rating: 6.5 Medical Kit
        4.5 Tricorder
        4.5 Engineering Kit
        1.0 all others

@{b}4)  All common Federation personnel from the basic set.@{ub} (11 cards)

    These are just weak. While the Federation have by far the best un-
    commons and rares, these cannot be seen as anything but a chance
    for the beginner to get a classification in which he doesn't have
    an uncommon or rare yet.

Ratings: Between 2.0 (Giusti) and 4.5 (Simon Tarses, male Medical!)

@{b}5)  The Treaty and Espionage cards.@{ub} (7 cards)

    I have mentioned these several times as support cards for strategies
    and I guess there will sooner or later be an article in Deck of the
    Week concerning these card types.

Ratings: 1.5 Treaties
         4.0 Espionage

@{b}6)  The Shuttlecrafts.@{ub} (2 cards)

    Weak, but I might someday change my mind if the rule about carrying
    shuttles aboard large ships becomes implemented.

Ratings: 1.0. (3.5 if playing Klingon)

@{b}7)  Raise the Stakes.@{ub} (1 card)

    This is not a gaming card but a gambling card.

Rating: Tear this apart and throw it away.

@{b}8)  All Dilemmas that say "Damages ship unless ***"@{ub} (4 cards)

    At the speed normal games proceed, these do far too little harm to
    be interesting. Besides that, their requirements to overcome are
    easy to meet.

Ratings: 1.0

@{b}9)  All remaining missions from the basic set except
        Investigate Time Continuum@{ub} (38 cards)

    Easy: I've done a few, they ARE quite similar and with the five I've
    done, everybody should be able to evaluate missions for themselves.
    The Time Continuum thing is a special case as there is a nasty
    Mission/Dilemma combo which I might want to publish some day.

Hi, folks,

you're waiting intensely, with trembling hands, shaken by my long absence ?
Even thinking about suicide ? Or, worse, about burning your STCCG set :-) ?
No need for that.
Here is:

    @{b}KURAK@{ub}

    Personnel, Klingon, rare.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 7
    Strength 6

    SCIENCE, Astrophysics, Computer Skill, Physics, Honor, Staff Star (+).

@{i}"Famed female Klingon scientist and warp-field specialist who evaluated the
@{"metaphasic shield" link COTD40}."@{ui}


If you need a better Klingon then her, well, you have to wait for the expan-
sions. You won't find any in the basic set.

In detail:
Attributes: Solid and balanced. Two 6's and a 7 make her a strong addition to
any crew that has to rely on Attributes for solving Dilemmas and missions, but
this is not Kurak's main advantage.

Most Klingon Science personnel suffer from the "OK, I am SCIENCE, so why do
I need useful skills?" syndrome. (Unfortunately, this also applies to Fed
and Rommie science officers. Guess we have to wait for Spock to get a good
Fed with SCIENCE.) Not so Kurak. Her skills are all useful.

Honor is the basic "Hi, I'm Klingon" skill. Nonetheless it is quite useful,
especially as there are several missions that need more than one Honor.
The combination of Astrophysics and Physics is very nice to have if you are
playing lots of space missions. Almost 2/3 of these require one of the two
skills and the latter does not often come in useful combinations, so it
sometimes requires the inclusion of a somewhat weak card.
Computer Skill is more like a little bonus if you consider the other skills.
Basically, it increases her usefulness on planet missions to something above
absolute zero, which helps to make Kurak a well-rounded card and a great
addition to any Klingon (and mixed Klin/Fed for that case) deck.


Favorite combo(s):

- I love her in any Fed/Klingon Treaty deck to help out the Feds' weak
  SCIENCE personnel.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #77@{ub}

Hi, folks,

how about a card that is worth nothing by itself ?

    @{b}HOLO-PROJECTORS@{ub}

    Event, uncommon.

Plays on table. This technology allows your holographic re-creations to be
projected and used on any of your ships or Away Teams.
(Immune to @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link COTD20})

@{i}"The hologram projector on Minos is an example of planet-based interactive
holographic technology."@{ui}


Too bad they didn't come up with the linking card concept in time for this
card. If you could seed it, this would be great. As it stands, it is more
like a lottery. Once you have it, you get great redshirts and you can access
some cool personnel cards. But if you rely on it and don't get it you are
doomed, as you lose the use of some key personnel.
(Decipher: How about a change to this card so it may be used like the linking
cards ?)

Of course, this card is double valuable to our Klingon and Romulan friends.
These cannot use their Holos at all unless they have @{"Husnock ships" link COTD41} (slow) or
the Holo-Projector. The Federation can at least create a space-mission
Hologram deck without relying on the Holo-Projectors (for which purpose the Fed
Holo cards are well suited anyway.)

A really good thing about this event is that they made it immune to @{"Kevin" link COTD20}.
Although I think the main purpose of this decision was to avoid rules fuss
(What happens to a hologram on a planet when the projector is destroyed?)
this immunity makes this the only invulnerable card in the game, so once
played it stays. The only problem is to get it out, and for this downside
this card is close to worthless. (You can't rely on lots of Holos for the
risk of not getting your Projector and with only a few Holos the net effect
of the card is too low.)

BTW: Using more than one Projector isn't that great either; you get one
earlier, but all others don't do anything sensible...


Favorite combo(s):

- Holo-Projectors + @{"Betazoid Gift Box" link COTD9}. The only way to get it to work
  reliably.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #78@{ub}

Hi, folks,

how about another counterspell ?

    @{b}THE DEVIL@{ub}

    Interrupt, rare.

Destroys any one Treaty card on table OR one @{"Horga'hn" link COTD10} OR
one @{"Wind Dancer" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD127"}.

@{i}"Ardra recreated the human mythical figure the Devil on Ventax II"@{ui}


One card - three uses. One of them badly necessary, the second one quite use-
ful, the third one to be neglected.

Let's start at the bottom: Destroying a @{"Wind Dancer" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD127"}? Why oh why should I do
this? With the original wording "may only pass if a smiling character is
present" this might have been a good Dilemma, but they dropped that for the
confusion it would cause. Youth OR Music is way too easy to overcome, so
forget this use of The Devil. (Who uses a @{"Wind Dancer" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD127"} anyway?)

Better: Destroying a treaty. Good two-color decks work without a treaty
anyway, but once it is out and you have made use of it, you are in serious
trouble when it is destroyed, as you lose a lot of time returning "wrong"
personnel to their outposts or ships. Even worse, some ships might be stalled
when they run out of command crew.

Best: Removing a @{"Horga'hn" link COTD10}. This card is nasty and powerful and it cannot be
destroyed by normal means like @{"Kevin" link COTD20} or @{"Amanda" link COTD31}. Once your opponent gets it
and you cannot counter it, you can often concede the game. So here the Devil
makes sense. A definite tournament card as you won't see many tourney decks
without a @{"Horga'hn" link COTD10}.

Summary: A must for a tourney deck. Much less useful in friendly play, as
you won't see as many @{"Horga'hns" link COTD10} there (there are house rules that ban this
card as being too strong!)


Favorite combo(s):

- Combos for a counterspell? Nah.

Hi, folks,

for those of you complaining "I don't have all these shiny rares, can't he
do something I HAVE?", here's a common:

    @{b}GALATHON@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan, common, universal.

    Integrity 3
    Cunning 7
    Strength 9

    OFFICER, Archaeology, Greed, Treachery, Command Star (*)

@{i}"Romulan Officer representative of those serving the Romulan Star Empire. Pur-
suer of DNA program in 2369."@{ui}


Gripe: Integrity 3. Did I hear "Firestorm" ?

Yikes: Greed. Can you tell me what to do with it (other than making the card
look as if it had three skills instead of two?)

Not bad: Archaeology. Romulan missions tend to involve a lot of digging around
for some long-lost stuff.

Always fun: Treachery. Especially as this is not so common amongst the
commons. And the other two that have it are not much better. Selok is a VIP
and has nothing to offer besides Treachery, and Taul is almost the same card,
but he is a SECURITY instead of an OFFICER.

The rest: Comand ability, Cunning and Strength. Nice to have but no disaster
to miss.

All in all: A mediocre Rommie, but nice for a cheap deck, especially as he
can be enhanced with the various kits and the Romulans are very short on
both ENGINEERING and MEDICAL personnel.


Favorite combo(s):

- Galathon + Medical Kit + Engineering Kit.

Hi, folks,

read this (recieved yesterday):
@{i}"We have followed your articles for a long time now and found out there is
a severe neglect to give the Cardassian Empire its due consideration. Should
this problem not be solved, diplomatic consequences will occur.
Signed:
Gul Dukat."@{ui}

Calm down, man. Here's what you were waiting for:

    @{b}OCETT@{ub}

    Personnel, Non-ali... er CARDASSIAN, uncommon.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 8
    Strength 6

    OFFICER, Archaeology, Navigation, Honor, Command Star (*)

@{i}"Gul Ocett, Cardassian female officer, Commander of a Galor-Class warship.
Pursuer of DNA program."@{ui}


A solid mix of skills and attributes, with no strikingly visible weaknesses.
As with @{"Kurak" link COTD76}, all three attribute values are 6 or better, so there is no
risk from low values and a considerable contribution to any total.
Ocett's skills are well mixed, especially if you use both planet and space
missions. Navigation is uncommon and well suited for Space locations,
Archaeology is by its nature more a planet skill (also of medium value) and
Honor is usable in both situations.

The OFFICER classification of course is not that strong, unless you are using
lots of equipment to give her a MEDICAL or ENGINEERING skill.
Ocett's strength definitely lies in her role as a support crew member,
supplying something useful to each mission instead of doing one mission all by
herself, a trait she has in common with many other non-aligned personnel.


Favorite combo(s):

- Ocett + @{"Evek" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD115"} as support crew.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #81@{ub}

Hi, folks,

How about a not-so-good Federation card that can still be worth something?


    @{b}NIKOLAI ROZHENKO@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, uncommon.

    Integrity 3
    Cunning 7
    Strength 4

    CIVILIAN, Anthropology, Computer Skill, Treachery, Staff Star (+)

@{i}"@{"Lieutenant Worf's" link COTD35} human foster brother. Son of Sergey and Helena Rozhenko."@{ui}


Well, as you see, lots of Weaknesses. Integrity 3 (Firestorm!!!) is the
worst, and Strength 4 is not much better. And Anthropology, who needs that ?

But Nikolai has two valuable things to contribute. First for @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13}
players, he is a Civilian, a Classification that is incredibly rare among
Federation crew. And the only two that also have it are Alexander Rozhenko
(Doh) and @{"Mot the Barber" link COTD24} (Ugh). So amongst these three he is still the best.
And even when considering Non-aligned personnel you can only add @{"Ishara Yar" link COTD98}
(compare her: worse) and Amarie (almost a @{"Mot" link COTD24}) to the list, so you'd better
stick with Nikolai if you want to use this artifact. (If not, a Civilian is
pretty much useless...)

And the second skill that is uncommon among Feds is - Treachery.
Only four cards have it (the other three are Eric Pressman, @{"Vash" link COTD88} and
@{"Ro Laren" link COTD92}) Two of them are rare and hard to obtain, and don't forget
that quite a few missions that need Treachery need more than one of it. A
notable exception is the one that is most useful for Feds: Pegasus Search. If
planning to use this, you'd better have a Treachery ready just in case you
can't uncover your interphase generator.

So: Useless in general, but useful for specialized decks (can you say
"surprise" ?)


Favorite combo(s):

- Nikolai Rozhenko + Pegasus Search. The only one I can think of.

Hi, folks,

can you spell "useless" with four letters ? I can: H-O-O-D. Which of course
is today's card:

    @{b}U.S.S. HOOD@{ub}

    Ship, Federation, rare.

    Range 7
    Shields 6
    Weapons 7

    Tractor Beam.
    Requires 0 Command(*), 2 Staff(+).

@{i}"Registry number NCC-42296. Named for the 20th century admiral, Sir Horace
Hood. Commanded by Captain Robert DeSoto."@{ui}


So what ? 7/6/7 and not even a Holodeck ? ARRRGH! Hey folks, we're playing
Feds here, so we have more Command Stars than we'd ever need. So use those
@{"Nebula Class" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD108"} Ships that require one Command and one Staff. For that extra
effort you get 8/7/8 on a common And a Holodeck. So why take this ?

Even compared to other affiliations, this ship is weak: A simple IKC Buruk
has 8/6/7 and a Cloaking Device and it requires one LESS staff! And Rommies
have no middleweight ships, but they have an 8/5/6 WITHOUT ANY requirements.
And in the non-aligneds I can get either a Combat Vessel (8/8/6) or a
@{"Mercenary ship" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD137"} (7/7/7) for the same cost.

Of course there is an explanation (but not an excuse) for this bad card:
Decipher wanted to stay close to the show and the Excelsior ships are old.
So they require much effort for comparably little output. But couldn't they
have given them something unique to make them worthwhile? A transwarp drive
that can double their range for one turn but at a risk of damage for
example ?

No. No. No. No. No. You'll never catch me playing this...

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #83@{ub}

Hi, folks,

another card for those of you who prefer a slow game:


    @{b}SUBSPACE WARP RIFT@{ub}

    Event, common.

Plays crosswise on any spaceline location. Any ship passing over here without
stopping incurs damage.

@{i}"Dr. Serova proved in 2370 that disastrous rifts occur in the fabric of space
due to the excessive use of warp drive. Discovery led to a Federation-wide
speed limit of Warp 5."@{ui}


Note one tiny detail on this card that makes it one half of a fun combo: It
says "Spaceline location", not "Mission". (If you don't want to be spoiled
try to find the combo now, I will place it under the appropriate section
below.)

Now the card in itself: It is of course one of those cards that affect both
players, so be very careful not to hurt yourself more than your opponent.
A location to play it on is your own outpost as you will often stop there
anyway.

Its effect is not too great, but might sometimes gain you one turn if it
is strategically placed. If playing it (not very probable) I'd rather re-
serve it for a situation in which I can count the movement of my opponent
and can guess (or know) her destination. Helps in cases where there are
effects like @{"incoming messages" link COTD68} or @{"Cytherians" link COTD47} (preferably with Birth of
Junior) in play. The extra turn lost here can (rarely but possibly) lose
a game (or destroy a ship in the @{"Cytherians" link COTD47}/BoJ combo).

Or (I didn't think of this, but two raters did - THX) use two of them. If
played in conjunction with an @{"Incoming Message" link COTD68} or a @{"Cytherians" link COTD47}: BOOM!
(She can't decide how far to move and thus can't stop, but you need a
few low-span missions in a row to fire the second one)

Normally an endgame card when you need it to gain just one turn to win.


Favorite combo(s):

- Or of course try this: Play Gaps in normal space next to your opponent's
  outpost (preferably in the direction she's gonna go most times). Then put
  a Subspace Warp Rift atop it. Stop and lose a personnel, don't stop and hurt
  your ship. (Evil grin)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #84@{ub}

Hi, folks,

another Dilemma for those of you who missed them:


    @{b}RADIOACTIVE GARBAGE SCOW@{ub}

    Dilemma, space, uncommon.

Place atop spaceline here. Mission cannot be done where present. Ships with
tractor beams and 2 ENGINEER can tow barge to a different location.

@{i}"Barges containing dangerous waste can be adrift for centuries. One such barge
threatened Gamelon V in 2367."@{ui}


Okay, another (yawn) stall card, but this time not the worst one. Makes for
lots of long faces and it has the definite advantage of gaining you a turn.
(Place it under a span 5 mission to increase the fun and if your opponent
has three missions in a row try the middle one, so it won't suddenly wind
up on your own cards.)

Although the criteria are not too hard to overcome, this one WILL take time
and when used in conjunction with a few other cards pretty much make a
mission worthless (Try it with @{"Cytherians" link COTD47} under a mission your opponent relies
on solving...)

It could also make for much fun with Birth of Junior, but unfortunately these
two are too similar in both requiring ENGINEERs, so once the first is solved
the second one becomes quite easy.

This card also combines quite well with the events (and interrupts)that
damage a ship.

The sneakiest variant: If your opponent has few ships and an outpost on a
space location, try placing it there. No more "free" mission solving that
you cannot prevent with temporal rifts and other funny stuff...

Almost a staple in my speed decks - it gets me one turn and I do a lot of
things in a single turn.


Favorite combo(s):

- Radioactive Garbage Scow + Plasma Fire. Forget your mission attempt if
  you don't have a SECURITY aboard.

Hi, folks,

something for those of you who still play green cards:


    @{b}TAIBAK@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan, rare.

    Integrity 2
    Cunning 8
    Strength 8

    SCIENCE, Treachery, Biology, Computer Skill, Staff Star (+).

@{i}"Scientist who developed a mind control device using E-Band emissions.
Controlled @{"Lt. Commander Geordi LaForge" link COTD32} through his VISOR."@{ui}


Uh, does not seem that bad at first glance ? Wrong. There is some better
stuff. And cheaper, too. (uncommon!) How about replacing Treachery with Honor?
Then upgrade that Staff Star to a full Command Star and increase Integrity to
6 (Goodbye Firestorms!) and what do you get ? Right: @{"N'Vek" link COTD67}. Arrrgh.

Once again, I don't understand this. Romulans are not so famous for good
Skill combinations and then they create one with a decent set of skills and
duplicate it! Nah, I'd rather prefer a little more variety in personnel cards,
even the excuse "They are not universal so you can now use two" does not hold.
If there is anything to complain about STCCG it is that the basic set lacks
variety because too many ideas could only be hinted at for lack of card slots.
And then this...

Okay, back to the card. What can we use him for ? SCIENCE is a life insurance,
Treachery and Biology fit a few missions (Extraction even needs both) and
Computer Skill is not that rare but you are in for a bad surprise if you lack
it (Impassable Door; I nail quite a few opponents with this one because they
don't expect it). Unfortunately, all this stuff is best suited for planets and
there's where the 2 Integrity is a big problem...

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #86@{ub}

Hi, folks,

how about an event that can cause lots of trouble, especially against non-
Federation decks ?


    @{b}Q-NET@{ub}

    Event, common.

Place between two adjacent spaceline locations. No ship may pass the Q-Net
unless 2 Diplomacy aboard.

@{i}"Q used an enormous forcefield grid in space to stop the @{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3}
in 2364."@{ui}


A fun card. Can be thrown early as a delay card or held in reserve to optimize
the effects of quite a few other nasty cards.

On its own, it is quite effective to delay Klingon and especially Romulan
decks. One of these next to the outpost and half of the spaceline is pretty
much lost to that player until she gets the 2 Diplomacy.

But the best thing about it are the combo opportunities.
I've discussed the @{"Incoming Message" link COTD68}/Q-Net combo in length in issue @{"#68" link COTD68}, so
I'll try a few others here.

First a similar idea, @{"Cytherians" link COTD47} and Q-Net are the same type of lock, but can
also be used to trap a ship at the far end of the line once it is there.
Many opponents will try to mount a rescue ship if there are even a few good
cards trapped thus losing even more time (and they will have to abandon the
ship there more often than not)

Can you upgrade this to a real killer ? Sure, place a Gaps in Normal space
right in front of the Q-Net. Your opponent must go right up to this location
and then - goodbye crew, one by one...

Also, try using it if an opponent tries a hasty retreat to the outpost to pick
up a much-needed SECURITY (Plasma Fire) or ENGINEERING (Birth of Junior) or
MEDICAL (REM Fatigue Hallucinations). See her sweat and then kiss her ship
goodbye (although she might be able to rescue the crew to a planet location,
but rescuing these is another chapter and costs time).

Surprises over surprises, if used correctly.


Favorite combo(s):

- The good old @{"Incoming Message" link COTD68}/Q-Net lock.

Hi, folks,

one more for the Klingon fans:


    @{b}TOQ@{ub}

    Personnel, Klingon, uncommon.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 5
    Strength 6

    CIVILIAN, Leadership, Computer Skill, Youth.

@{i}"Klingon male, born in Romulan prison camp in Carraya system. Protege of
@{"Lieutenant Worf" link COTD35}."@{ui}


A rather average Klingon. One high point (Leadership), one low (CIVILIAN),
and the rest is neither good nor bad. His time only comes when you play the
@{"Kurlan Naiskos" link COTD13} as he's by quite a length the best Civilian in the entire set.
At least his attributes are balanced and he has two useful skills, a thing
you cannot say of any other Civilians.

Also, his versatility is quite good. While providing the needed 7th Classifi-
cation for the @{"Naiskos" link COTD13}, he can still be of some use for missions (but not
Dilemmas except the Impassable Door). This applies both to space missions and
to planet missions, so no preference there.

And again, there is of course the "Directly comparable" card, but this time
I've picked the better card for my review. But as I want to augment the COTD
Readers' Hall of Fame by yet another name, I won't tell you this time.
But it's another Klingon personnel, of course.
Honorable mention of course to the first to name the correct card. Habibs and
other gods explicitly excluded from this round :-)


Favorite combo(s):

- He's a support card if you play the @{"Naiskos" link COTD13}. No more no less.

Hi, folks,

I'm back! And I've dug out a beautiful card for ya:


    @{b}VASH@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare.

    Integrity 3
    Cunning 8
    Strength 4

    CIVILIAN, Archaeology x 2, Treachery, Anthropology

@{i}"Extraordinary archaeology treasure hunter. Traveled with Q. Romantically in-
volved with @{"Captain Jean-Luc Picard" link COTD1}. Lovable character, not to be trusted."@{ui}


This is what you might characterize as "a Romulan with a blue background."
With her low Integrity and her Treachery skill she would make the average
Rommie (also high Cunning!). But as it stands, this card makes for an inter-
esting but not necessarily great Federation character. Her greatest asset is
anthropology, a skill only three Feds possess. The other two are
@{"Nikolai Rozhenko" link COTD81}) and Darian Wallace (common Security, otherwise worthless)

Wallace isn't really worth comparing, but the comparison to @{"Nikolai R." link COTD81} is
quite interesting. His attributes are almost the same (3/7/4) and he has
Computer Skill instead of the Archaeology x2. Now which card do I prefer?
When using one of these two, it is because I need some very rare (though
momentarily also rarely used) skills. So, I'd better go for Vash as she's
a key character in my deck anyway if I use her and in this case the rare
Archaeology is worth more to me than the much more common Computer Skill.


Favorite combo(s):

- @{"Nikolai Rozhenko" link COTD81} + Vash used in an espionage deck (these two
  back up each other so I can afford losing one of them)
- Vash + @{"Picard" link COTD1} + * + @{"DNA Hunt" link COTD62}

    Personnel, Romulan, rare.

Oops, a Romulan with Honor ? And Leadership on top of it ? And yet another
useful skill ? Hey, these people are really getting sympathetic...

Toreth is one of the personnel that basically save you a card because she
combines two rare (for Romulans) skills and good stats to give a
well-rounded Officer. Leadership is not that uncommon among the rare Rommies
but normally you don't get much to go with it (@{"Sela" link COTD23} and Tebok are the
big exceptions). But much more important, she's one of the three female
Rommies with acceptable skills. (@{"Sela" link COTD23} and @{"Varel" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD117"} are the other two).

If you are really sneaky, seed LOTS of artifacts (or at least one good card)
under an opponent's Fed mission, espionage against it and watch his jaw drop!
The crew for this: Toreth, Tebok, @{"Sela" link COTD23}, @{"Roga Danar" link COTD18}, @{"Ocett" link COTD80}. You can seed a

Hi, folks,

A ship ya said ? Well, they are boring, but if you asked me ...
(And if you didn't: Look at the survey. Lots of people did.)


    @{b}I.K.C. BORTAS@{ub}

    Ship, Klingon, rare.

    Range 9
    Weapons 9
    Shields 7

    Requires: *++

    Cloaking Device, Tractor Beam.

@{i}"@{"Gowron's" link COTD5} flagship during the Klingon Civil War of 2367-68. @{"Lieutenant Worf" link COTD35}
briefly served aboard as a weapons officer."@{ui}


This is probably the best Klingon ship. Although the Qu'Vat has the same
range and the same point total, shield points are the least important ones,
as they can very easily be boosted to obscene heights by
@{"Nutational or Metaphasic shields" link COTD40}.
And at Weapons 9, she can blast EVERY ship except the
@{"Enterprise" link COTD3}, the basic Galaxy and of course the clumsy
@{"Husnock ship" link COTD41} out of space.

Unfortunately she's not that great for an Armada deck (the major reason to
play Klingon), as she needs the three crew. In these cases, I'd rather use
a bunch of K'Vort class ships with one crew each and head straight for the
opponent's outpost. With a @{"Red Alert" link COTD6} and a @{"Traveler" link COTD4}, slow moving
decks will be denied their only outpost in six or seven turns without even
a chance to do anything.

Nonetheless, the best ship for not-so-aggressive Klingon decks that balance
between combat and mission-solving.


Favorite combo(s):

- This in a Fed/Klingon Treaty deck...

Hi, folks,

let's play a little game... A


    @{b}KTARIAN GAME@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space, rare.

Place on ship. Now and at start of eah of your turns, one person aboard (ran-
dom selection) is disabled. Cured when non-disabled CUNNING>30 OR android
aboard.

@{i}"Psychotropically, mesmerizingly addictive game device. One by one, its
players are made susceptible to complete mental control."@{ui}


This card once inspired me for another personnel card :

ROBIN LEFLER (rare!)
Integrity 5, Cunning 6, Strength 4.
ENGINEER, Computer Skill.
If Robin Lefler and @{"Wesley Crusher" link COTD26} are on the same ship they each have
CUNNING=16.

'Nuff said ? This Dilemma is way too easy to overcome with any kind of decent
cew. As a common, I would have accepted it, maybe as an uncommon. But as a
rare ? When all the great personnel are floating around ?

The only way to nail a crew with this one is to first get them into a working
@{"Nagilum" link COTD51} to really decimate them. Blasting just a single crewmember won't nor-
mally help (except maybe against Klingons).

With that Robin Lefler card it would just have been a nice tribute to one of
the best episodes and realistic enough, too. (@{"Wes" link COTD26} and Robin solved this one).

A little rules notice: This Dilemma only DISABLES the crew. So even if the
whole crew is eliminated, it is not discarded. If you're able to send another
ship with the 31 CUNNING, you can instantly reactivate them !

BTW: Shaka is much better. The 30 CUNNING are augmented by 2 Diplomacy and
it's Planet and Space...


Favorite combo(s):

- @{"Nagilum" link COTD51} + Ktarian Game. The only one that worx.

Hi, folks,

I don't have any more Bridge Crew for you, but how about the next best thing:


    @{b}RO LAREN@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare.

    Integrity 4
    Cunning 7
    Strength 5

    OFFICER, Computer Skill, Navigation, Treachery, Staff Star (+)

@{i}"Ensign Ro Laren is a Bajoran female. Protege of @{"Captain Jean-Luc Picard" link COTD1}.
Sympathetic to the Maquis. A bit of a renegade."@{ui}


OK, this one easily wins the "Mot Award (TM)" in the category "Worst flavor
text". Such an interesting character and such boring stuff...

What else ? Not much. Use a @{"Wesley" link COTD26} instead. If you don't urgently need
Treachery, that is. @{"Wes" link COTD26} does everything Ro does, and he does it a lot better.
(Not surprising as Ro was his replacement...) Even for stats, you won't win
anything with her. 4/7/5 is beaten by ALL Bridge crew members including Tasha,
but except @{"Deanna" link COTD39} (Strength 4).

So what use is Ro Laren ?
You could say, she is an alternative for those players who cannot afford the
high prices of Bridge Crew cards on the secondary market. But nope, not even
this is a valid answer as Ro's value comes very close to those of the minor
Bridge crew cards (@{"Deanna" link COTD39}, Tasha, @{"Beverly" link COTD22}, @{"Wesley" link COTD26}) and she's also included in
most Bridge Crew sets I've seen sold. So this does not help.

Well, so only Treachery remains as an advantage. Let's check this:
What we need is a mission that needs Treachery. Let's have a quick look.

-Wormhole Negotiations. By the time I have the 4 Treachery I probably have 9
 Diplomacy. Nah.
-Khitomer Research. Romulan use only. Ouch.
-Extraction. Same Thing. Ouch x2.
-Covert Installation. Another one. Ouch x3.
-Expose Covert Supply. This gets boring. Ouch x4.
-Strategic Diversion. ENOUGH!!! Ouch x5.
-@{"Investigate Sighting" link COTD63}. Not a good mission choice except for Empath decks. And
 in this case I have the Empathy x2. Booh.
-Secret Salvage. Treachery x4 ? For this price I can get 45 points instead of
 30. And Nav x2 plus Compy Skill is much easier. And I need to espionage.
 Arrgh.
-Plunder Site. Built for @{"Vash" link COTD88}, not for Ro. And Espionage again. Doh.
-Pegasus Search. Yup. If I really don't get my @{"Interphase Generator" link COTD15}.
 Treachery and Navigation helps. Use @{"Picard" link COTD1} for the rest. A few Strength from
 wherever. But only as a backup, in case I can't uncover my @{"Interphase" link COTD15}...


Favorite combo(s):

- Remember @{"Troi" link COTD39} (COTD#39) ? Same thing here.

Hi, folks,

just found time for this one:


    @{b}GORTA@{ub}

    Personnel, Non-aligned, universal, common (and common WP)

    Integrity 3
    Cunning 7
    Strength 4

    ENGINEER, Physics, Greed.

@{i}"Male of Dopterian race. Representative of non-aligned agents. An opportunist.
Had an encounter with the sisters of Duras in 2370."@{ui}


Well, his best trait ? He's non-aligned. His second best ? He's universal,
too. His other good traits ? ............................. (Eh, can't think
of anything right now)

Okay, what's the deal with this card ? A card they had to reprint for the Warp
Pack ! Actually, the question as for why they did this is quite easily solved.
Gorta has one acceptable skill: Physics. Unfortunately, this skill is not very
common and it's even less common amongst common personnel. But with Test
Mission and @{"Relief Mission" link COTD64} there are TWO common Warp Pack missions that do
require Physics. So to make these usable, they had to include a non-aligned
(to make it usable for all) common (as all WP cards are commons) character
with Physics. Look at all four non-aligned commons: only one choice remains
open :-(

What else ? ENGINEERs are useful but they exist in abundance. On the other
hand, you often need more than one of them. Greed can be neglected (Never
used). Stats are crappy, especially with that 3 Integrity.
Result: A beginner's card. At best.


Favorite combo(s):

Hi, folks,

I promised (in @{"#75" link COTD75}) to perhaps do one more mission: Here it is.


    @{b}INVESTIGATE TIME CONTINUUM@{ub}

    Mission, Federation, Planet, rare.

    35 Points

    Span 3

Guinan OR @{"Data" link COTD7} OR @{"Time Travel Pod" link COTD14}

@{i}"Dividia II: Trace mysterious time-traveling aliens living in a parallel time
continuum."@{ui}


An interesting card to say the least. And a good one too.

Three requirements, only one of them needs to be fulfilled. And 35 points,
so this sounds quite easy.

Well, on second sight, the first alternative is rather hard to fulfill, but
we'll see... :-)

Lets check the second: One single crewmember can do it: @{"Data" link COTD7}. So this is less
than reliable. But wait a second: Who says this is the FIRST mission I have
to solve ? And who stops me from placing a @{"Betazoid Gift Box" link COTD9} under this first
mission ? Then retrieve @{"Data" link COTD7} and whatever else seems good and go for it: A
Betazoid 35 points gift...

For the third requirement: @{"Time Travel Pod" link COTD14}. I'd rather use that one on an op-
ponent's ship. And if I need to uncover an artifact to solve this mission,
why not take one that gives me something else (see above...) ?

But now for the nasty little combo with this card. Well, not exactly combo as
this relies on YOUR OPPONENT using this mission. Try a shiny little Alien
Abduction as the last Dilemma under this mission. 3 Leadership is incredibly
rare and then the most CUNNING Away Team member gets abducted. Guess who this
will be :-) Nice little @{"Data" link COTD7}-nullifier...

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #95@{ub}

Hi, folks,

Once again I will be doing two cards in one issue, but this time with a twist
as they really are two versions of one card:


    @{b}EMERGENCY TRANSPORTER ARMBANDS@{ub}

    Interrupt, common.

Beam Personnel up or down at any time, even during a battle before the winner
is determined (Limited / Alpha variant)

Beam Personnel up or down at any time except during the resolution of a Di-
lemma, unless the Dilemma card explicitly allows the use of this card. May
use it during a battle, before the winner is determined (Beta variant;
paraphrased)

@{i}"Devices which allow quick remote activation of a transporter
when in danger."@{ui}


Note: The Beta cards have not yet shipped (at least AFAIK), and I don't have
any white-borders anyway so I paraphrased the effect. Decipher wants all
players to use the most recent wording, so even limited ETA's will become
watered down for tourney play.

OK, to the review: This was designed for the Rommies to escape Firestorms
until they print the Thermal Deflectors. But a card with such a limited use
was (correctly) classified as to weak. So they added the battle part of it
(not too bad if you were attacked by something) and expanded the use to all
Dilemmas. This in return caused lots of not-so-great players to use the ETA
as an "Oops" card and beam out every time they struck a Dilemma. So they in-
tended to fix this and went back to the original design. IMHO THIS WAS A BIG
MISTAKE !!!

Look, using this card as an "Oops" costs you a slot in your deck. Sure, it
allows peeking at a Dilemma and still saving the crew (You could have used a
Full planet scan instead...). Saving your *ss just once isn't the best
application anyway. So you need multiples of these to be sure to survive
"Oops"es. Well, I don't have several card slots in a 60 card deck to compensate
for bad play. And so doesn't the aforementioned beginner. Each ETA costs him a
really powerful card like a @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link COTD20}, a @{"Traveler" link COTD4} or a @{"Picard" link COTD1}.
So I guess now these cards will become even more what they have somewhat been
from the start: Wallpaper with some minor use for Rommies.

BTW: Rommie Players who want to overcome Firestorms without crew loss can do
the following: Tebok + @{"Toreth" link COTD89} (two good OFFICERs) + Medical Kit +
@{"Genetronic Replicator" link COTD46}. Sure that's four cards instead of one but these four will
continue to be useful even after the Firestorm.

Hi, folks,

we heven't seen a Vulcan for ... ummm ... a long time, so let's fix this:

    Personnel, Federation, uncommon.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 9
    Strength 4

    SCIENCE x2, Staff Star (+)

@{i}"Vulcan female. Dr T'Pan served as director of the prestigious Vulcan Science
Academy. Preeminent expert in subspace morphology."@{ui}


Ho-Hum. I'm always a little short on SCIENCE for the various Dilemmas, but on
the other hand I'm even shorter on crew slots for my deck (playing only 13
personnel cards !) So I have to go for diversity instead of high amounts of
a single skill. And worse, there are not many Dilemmas that need more than
one SCIENCE. Ancient Computer is one of them, but normally 3 ENGINEER are
easy to come by. Nitrium Metal Parasites is about the same case, but with
2 each of ENGINEER or SCIENCE. Nanites is no trouble for any Federation
deck worth the name (Diplomacy ???) and that's it! Right, just 3 Dilemmas.

And then there's missions. NOT ONE mission requires any SCIENCE!!! So what
do I need two SCIENCE on one card for ? BTW: If playing Planet missions only,
the Dilemmas aren't a threat either: They are all three Space Dilemmas.
So the double SCIENCE is a total loss as far as the current set of cards is
concerned (I hope AU fixes this, we really need to see a few more uses for
SCIENCE than just as a Life Insurance against a few Dilemmas).

So with the second SCIENCE being worthless, this card can only fall into
one slot: crappy.
(Hey, don't use that @{"Metaphasic Shields" link COTD40} argument: I use the @{"Nutational" link COTD40}
variant, as @{"Geordi" link COTD32}, @{"Wesley" link COTD26}, @{"Data" link COTD7}, @{"Roga Danar" link COTD18} and Dr. Reyga supply enough
ENGINEERING power.)

Hi, folks,

a major theme in most games is affecting card play and one of the few STCCG
cards that does this is


    @{b}MASAKA TRANSFORMATIONS@{ub}

    Event, uncommon.

Plays on any player. That player must shuffle entire hand, placa on bottom of

after use.

   a tournament situation.

2) Spoil a GREAT hand of your opponent.
   This one is OK, but you need to know a time your opponent is holding good
   cards. Of course, a grin might sometimes hint at a good draw.

The major use, however, is to nullify a @{"Betazoid Gift Box" link COTD9}. (Yeah, and that's
the only way to do so.) A deck like mine that relies on a fast first mission
and then on @{"BGB'ing" link COTD9} the urgently needed cards for solving the second can be
crippled by the use of this card. Note that you always get a chance to use it,
as I won't be able to play more cards (except Interrupts) in a turn I used the
@{"Gift Box" link COTD9} and your turn is next. (@{"Horga'hn" link COTD10} does of course upset this, but with
both artifacts already found you're lost anyway...)

OH, BTW (by Lore): A few more ways to tell your opponent has a good hand:
- She just played a @{"Tox Uthat" link COTD11}
- She just played @{"Alien Probe" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD133"} or @{"TAK" link COTD44}
- Either of you played @{"Alien probe" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD133"} and you see what's up

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #98@{ub}

Hi, folks,

care for another Yar ?


    @{b}ISHARA YAR@{ub}

    Personnel, Non-aligned, uncommon.

    Integrity 3
    Cuning 7
    Strength 8

    CIVILIAN, Treachery, Youth, Staff Star (+)

@{i}"Sister of Lieutenant Natasha Yar. Once betrayed the @{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link COTD3} crew in
an attempt to aid the rebels on Turkana IV."@{ui}


Arrgh. The second worst non-aligned (although she looks somewhat good). A
Civilian is not worth anything unless you're using the @{"Naiskos" link COTD13}, Youth is a
skill that all affiliations have in abundance and Treachery is one of those
skills that are rare but useless for one affiliation (Fed) and highly use-
ful but common as dirt for another (Rom). Combined with the sub-par (read
below 5) Integrity, Ishara just SUX. Worse still, the few cases Youth is
needed, Treachery isn't even remotely useful and the other way round. And
both are not the skills you would want to build a deck around (well, perhaps
a Romulan all-space-mission deck around Treachery, but you'd need a few more
expansion cards for this).

One plus: perhaps the most famous character among the (few) non-aligned cards
printed yet.


Favorite combo(s):

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #99@{ub}

Hi, folks,

just stuck in "Bad card" mode, so let's look at another:


    @{b}DISTORTION FIELD@{ub}

    Event, uncommon.

Plays crosswise on any planet location. On each of your turns, flip card over.
While face up, prevents any beam down here unless pattern enhancers in play.

@{i}"Atmospheric phenomena that inhibits use of transporters, as on Nervala IV."@{ui}


This one has just a very minor use, the one of slowing down a player by one
turn, unless the player just reconsiders his actions and tries a different
mission first. And the fact that it does cost you a turn (Event) does not
make it any better.

But then, as with most BAD cards, you can put this to a
good use. Remember those pesky all-planet mission tournament decks ?
Preferably those with few ships and their outpost at a really EASY mission.
(Evaluate Terraforming, anybody ?)
What to do ?
Use TWO Distortion Fields !!!!!
Play the first one right away and the second one the next turn - on the same
mission !!!
Result: Unless opponent has pattern enhancers, perfect lock ! One of the two
is always face up - one valuable @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link COTD20} gone. If you then have a Q2...


Favorite combo(s):

- The only one that is sensible. (see above)

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #100@{ub}

Hi, folks,

sorry for the fact that my "Captain's Holiday" was a little longer than in-
tended, but being a highly active member in a fast-growing Star Trek Club
sometimes takes its toll... (Had to work up all that was left from those two
weeks)
Anyway, as Decipher was not allowed to tell me card texts, I dug deep into
my treasure chest of ideas, and presto, I hereby present you:


    @{b}MIRROR UNIVERSE@{ub}

    Dilemma, either, rare, Dream Card(*).

All Dilemmas at this location will have their conditions inverted. You must
NOT fulfill the prerequisites or your crew will suffer the consequences.

@{i}"In a mirror universe, events that really happened will be nonexistent but
others just will have happened instead."@{ui}

Picture: @{"Cmdr Riker" link COTD19} in the captain's chair, being mirrored upside down in
a distorted fashion by some hazy effect.

(*) We might actually see this one in AU, as I've sent the idea to Decipher
and they did like it. However, it will most probably have a different name
(they had a card of this name in the making that had a different effect).


This is a dual-purpose card and a powerful one, too. But it also involves
some danger...

First use: Nullify Dilemmas. Place it late under a location your opponent has
heavily seeded at. Then rush in with a minimal crew (@{"Mot the Barber" link COTD24} might
come handy) and solve the dilemmas one after one as you can never fulfill any
requirement. Then, when it comes to the mission, leave @{"Mot" link COTD24} stopped and rush
in with the minimal crew. Two dangers are involved in this strategy:

a) Your opponent might have used unconditional dilemmas. These don't get af-
   fected. (@{"Male's love interest" link COTD74}, anyone?)
b) There might be a nasty trap in form of - another Mirror Universe ! Both
   cancel each other and you're back to normal...

Of course, there is a nasty combo to circumvent this: Play the following
cards on an "Evaluate Terraforming": Any Artifact + @{"Q" link COTD30} + Mirror Universe. Then
have @{"Beverly Crusher" link COTD22} make your day. 35 points + the artifact with no risk.

Second use: Counter those pesky "Mega-Away-Team" decks. Place a Mirror
Universe at a strategic location and use those nasties that are otherwise WAY
too easy too overcome. Try Cosmic String Fragment with this one: BANG! Also
nice: a mirrored Two-Dimensional Creatures ("Ship can't move until you get
rid of all SCIENCE or all ENGINEERs", use a @{"Warp Core Breach" link "STCCG:cotd200.guide/COTD111"} if she tries
the latter...) Many more are possible.

This card makes the use of Scan-Type cards absolutely vital for decent
chances at survival.


Favorite combo(s):

- Evaluate Terraforming + @{"Q" link COTD30} + Mirror Universe + @{"Beverly Crusher" link COTD22}: 35 points.
- Mirror Universe + Cosmic String Fragment: Big Bang.
- Mirror Universe + Crystalline Entity: Arrggh.
- On planet: @{"Barclay's Disease" link COTD29} + Mirror Universe + @{"Crystalline Entity" link COTD52}
  (encountered in this exact order. Figure it out yourself.) The ultimate
  Away-Team Killer.


Ratings : I can't give a rating for this one. It has experienced too little
play to really evaluate it in full. But, I'd say it's at least a 9.0, if not
more.
