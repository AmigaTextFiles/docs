    @{b}@{u}Warp FAQ@{ub}@{uu}

Some notes from the leaflet:

@{"NEUTRAL OUTPOST" link "XXPATH:facility.guide/NEUTRALOUTPOST"}: This card meets a player's need for a basic
outpost. Personnel and ships from all affiliations may report for duty here,
as long as they don't "mix" aboard the outpost at the same time (unless,
of course, there is a treaty... see treaty rules on page 30 of the rule
booklet). A @{"Neutral Outpost" link "XXPATH:facility.guide/NEUTRALOUTPOST"} may be seeded or built only at "space mission
locations," not planet locations. Unlike a normal outpost, it has no
facilities to repair ships... but, it has other advantages that make it useful
for @{i}all players@{ui}. Other cards in Expansion Sets will refer to @{"Neutral Outposts" link "XXPATH:facility.guide/NEUTRALOUTPOST"}.

@{"COUNTERMANDA" link "XXPATH:interrupts.guide/COUNTERMANDA"} and @{"YELLOW ALERT" link "XXPATH:event.guide/YAL"}: These two cards are
aimed against tactics which newcomers might otherwise find
overwhelming. They help balance the use of some other cards without
eliminating any existing strategies. @{"Yellow Alert" link "XXPATH:event.guide/COUNTERMANDA"} help mitigate the power
of @{"Red Alert" link "XXPATH:event.guide/REDAL"} cards, while @{"Countermanda" link "XXPATH:interrupts.guide/YAL"} stops @{"Telepathic Alien Kidnappers" link "XXPATH:event.guide/TAK"}
and "throws a monkey wrench" into a strategy which relies heavily on
@{"Res-Q" link "XXPATH:event.guide/RESQ"} or @{"Palor Toff" link "XXPATH:interrupts.guide/PALORTOFFALIENTRADER"}.

@{"SCOTTY" link "XXPATH:federation.guide/SCOTTY"}: A "bonus" card... a way of saying thank you for your patience
as we prepared our @{i}Warp Pack@{ui} solution to your feedback concerning
distribution. Note: @{"Scotty's" link "XXPATH:federation.guide/SCOTTY"} skill of "Miracle Worker" will come into play
via other cards.

@{b}@{i}@{ub}@{ui}

On page 11 in the black and white rule booklet, it states... "Cards
incorrectly seeded are discarded when they are discovered." This should
read... "Cards incorrectly seeded are placed out-of-play when they are
discovered." This rules clarification prevents someone from intentionally
mis-seeding artifacts so they can be illegally rescued from the discard pile.
