        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #101@{ub}

Hi, folks,

did you like yesterday's card ? Good. I did, too. And because I did, I opted
to make a "Dream-Card" mini-series of say eight cards. Almost all of these
have been suggested to Decipher and so we might see them sooner or later.
Until then, have fun.


    @{b}NICK HATHAWAY (*)@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare, Dream Card.

    Integrity 2
    Cunning 11
    Strength 13

    OFFICER, ENGINEER x2, SECURITY, Biology x3, Kills one crewmember (random
    selection) every turn unless Empathy present. Command Star (*)

@{i}"After the utter destruction of the U.S.S. Stardust which left him as the
sole survivor, Lt. Hathaway was always hanging on the edge of madness."@{ui}

(*) I've changed the name of this card. Originally, it was named after a
former friend of mine who almost managed to destroy our club in a fit of
jealousy. His name shall remain unpublished. In my suggestion to Decipher
I've made this an "Aquiel Uhnari" card.


This was less of a card than of a concept, namely to create really strong
crewmembers and balance them with some kind of "casting cost" or "upkeep".
An ENGINEER x2 + SECURITY combination is awesome enough, with the added
Biology x3, and the Cunning and Strength he becomes way too strong.
There are a handful of missions he can solve alone and more than just a few
for which he requires the assistance of just one other personnel. (@{"Vekor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD37"}
might come in handy.) And this is indeed one of his uses. Drop him somewhere,
have him solve a mission and then he kills himself. Neat and clean. But of
course, there is the other idea of keeping him around for all the abilities
he has to give, in which case you need some Empathy around (even 1/2 Empathy
will suffice. What ? 1/2 Empathy ? Right. That's another Dream card. [@{"#107" link COTD107},
and the only one I've never suggested to Decipher])

But let's assume you don't have that card @{"#107" link COTD107}. So we need to take a quick
look around our empaths. The two @{"Trois" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD39"}, Tam Elbrun and @{"Devinioni Ral" link COTD142}. That's
all we have. Best choice would be Tam Elbrun here. Now is this worth the
effort ? I'd say yes it is. Tam Elbrun is not that great, but you get an
overpowered @{"Roga Danar" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD18"} in return. Not too bad.


Favorite combo(s):

- Nick Hathaway + Tam Elbrun + @{"Vekor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD37"}. A mini-away team that is all but
  dilemma-proof (except for that *+%$& Firestorm!)


Rating : 8.5 (again, this is only an about rating. I've used the cards only
for very few games.)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #102@{ub}

Hi, folks,

now everybody might ask: What ? Only super-high-powered rare Dream Cards ?
Nope. Here's the proof. A nice useful idea for a common:


    @{b}DESERT WORLD@{ub}

    Event, common, Dream Card.

Play on any planet location. Any away team stopped here will lose one member
(random selection). Not cumulative.

@{i}"On hot worlds with arid climates, away teams without adequate protection will
have huge trouble surviving even for one full day."@{ui}

Picture: A vast desert.


Simple, but useful. Especially when used with a stall deck (must I say
@{"Rogue Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"}?). Probably after the first two or three times you hit somebody with it,
its simple presence will be enough to really discourage attempts at that par-
ticular mission. Once again, there are two uses (but they are similar):

a) Increase the power of your Dilemmas. Use it in conjunction with those
   Dilemma cards that have hard conditions but not-too-great effects as a little
   booster. Will work quite well with all "cannot get past unless ..." Dilemmas,
   also Alien Abduction, Chalnoth or @{"Sarjenka" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD45"} are possible choices.
b) Use it as a surgical away-team decimator. For this use, you will need
   @{"Rogue Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} and a Lore Returns. Wait until the away team is on location, then bring
   in your @{"R.B." link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} one by one, each eliminating an away team member AND stopping
   the crew for another turn. How to get the @{"R.B." link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} into play ? Well, how about
   placing @{"Mot" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD24"} on a Runabout and playing them on YOUR OWN SHIP ??? Nice little
   battle force...


Favorite combo(s):

- Desert world + Chalnoth. Arrgh + Arrgh.

PS. To avoid any hassle and to answer the unavoidable question right away:
No, I cannot and will not make any copies of my dream cards available to
ANYONE. First this violates copyrights by Paramount and Decipher, second,
the pictures used are photos of my friends and THEY don't like being sent
all over the world, and third, I don't want to go copy cards every other
day. So if you want to experiment with them, create your own designs (or
better, make up your own ideas and email them to Decipher. This gives you a
good chance to one day use your card even in official play.)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #103@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's another little nasty surprise:


    @{b}COURT-MARTIAL@{ub}

    Interrupt, common, Dream card.

Play on an away team that just lost a member. Unless Bureaucracy (*) present,
its player loses 10 points.

@{i}"With the often unjust court-martials, the Admirality frequently piles the
insult of punishment on top of the injury of losing a valued crewmember."@{ui}

(*) Bureaucracy is a skill I invented to enhance a few of my Admiral
characters. You can substitute Leadership.


Try this with a Klingon Battle deck. Each time you win a battle, just drain
10 points from your opponent, too. Also works nicely with some of the middle-
strength dilemmas. (It is not usable with the @{"Crystalline Entity" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD52"} and not
very sensible with @{"Barclay's P. Disease" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD29"}.)

Of course, this works a little differently whether it is worded with
Leadership or Bureaucracy. Whilst Leadership is a skill useful in itself,
Bureaucracy was very much designed to be a "shortcut" skill present as an
alternative to some really hefty mission requirements and as a skill useful
to avoid some otherwise nasty plots.

In the Bureaucracy variant this is a bigger threat, especially to speed deck
players. With only a few (albeit good) Bureaucracy-capable cards you will be
in a little trouble getting them out. (I have made up only three of them.)
Also, Bureaucracy is a strategy in itself, so even if these cards were
available you might hit a few players with this.

With Leadership, at least the Federation won't have too much trouble getting
around this one.

If you want to experiment with Bureaucracy, here's a Bonus Card:


    @{b}Admiral Connaught Rossa@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, uncommon, Dream Card.

    Integrity 8, Cunning 7, Strength 3

    OFFICER, Diplomacy, Bureaucracy, Anthropology, Honor. Command Star (*).

(From "Suddenly Human")


Favorite combo(s):

-  @{"Desert World" link COTD102} + Court-Martial. Two Dream cards for a dream combo.


Rating : 7.5 (Bureaucracy) / 6.5 (Leadership)

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #104@{ub}

Hi, folks,

some of the best cards are made by combining several cards into one (a little
weaker of course). So is this one:


    @{b}PARALLELS@{ub}

    Event, rare, Dream Card.

Exchange any 2 of your cards of the same type. These may be cards in play,
in your hand, draw deck or discard pile.

@{i}"Parallel universes that touch each other are only very slightly different.
Sometimes a rift might allow passage between them."@{ui}


This beauty can perform several functions.

The first and most obvious is to retroactively change a random selection
death or running off into an "owner's choice" one. P*ssed off that your
@{"Beverly" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD22"} ran off to the farthest planet ? Exchange her with @{"Mot the Barber" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD24"}
(thereby effectively changing the @{"Female Love Interest" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD74"} into a
@{"Male Love Interest" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD74"}). Angry at losing your @{"Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} to a Ship Seizure ?
Transform a Shuttlecraft into a new @{"Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"}...

But if you only think of this card as a resurrection card, you're missing
lots of its potential. It can also be used as a minor @{"Betazoid Gift Box" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD9"}
(exchanging a not-so-needed crewmember in play for the one you need JUST
NOW!). Or, replace your @{"Static Warp Bubble" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD48"} made useless by your opponent
having lost all cards with, say, a @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} or a @{"Genetronic Replicator" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"}.

The third use is similar but sometimes crucial. It also works as a nice little
Teleport. Need two Diplomacy for a @{"Q-Net" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD86"} but have @{"Sarek" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD72"} stuck on the other
side ? Exchange him with whatever crewmember you consider expendable.

The drawback of this card: It essentially costs you a turn. (Not an interrupt)
And, it costs you a card slot. But nonetheless, having double chances of
getting your @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} early or getting a crucial crewmember at the right
time are not chances to be neglected.


Favorite combo(s):

- As a rommie, move somewhere fast with a @{"Pi" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD60"}, then suddenly Parallel in
  your Warbird and FIRE!

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #105@{ub}

Hi, folks,

something is still missing in STCCG: A mission you can play on a ship as an
interrupt. Thus, here comes:


    @{b}V.I.P. TRANSPORT@{ub}

    Interrupt, uncommon, Dream Card.

Play on a ship. It must go to the farthest planet to recieve 20 points. You
may discard any number of VIP's there for 10 additional points each.

@{i}"Many parsecs worth of space have been traversed by starships just to get
some V.I.P. where he wanted to be."@{ui}

Picture: an ornately dressed ambassador.


Again a dual use:

1) Play it on one of your own ships. Either a big one, laden with VIP's in
   hope of making 60, 70 or even more points at one location (but you'd better
   make sure you have lots of shields and weapons in order not to be delayed
   by lots of battles), or just a small Runabout / Scout steered by a single
   expendable VIP in order to get a quick 30 points and a good distraction.
   For this purpose, @{"Wormholes" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD8"}, WNOHGB, Transwarp Conduits and similar stuff
   come in very handy.

2) As an annoyance for an opponent. Especially if used in conjunction with
   an @{"Incoming Message" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD68"}. Play the VIP Transport, wait until the opponent is
   almost there, fire the @{"I.M." link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD68"} Opponent has to return to the outpost then go
   all the way to the farthest planet again with a ship he'd rather use to
   solve missions. In the meantime: just collect your 100 points.


Favorite combo(s):

- VIP Transport + @{"Incoming Message" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD68"}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #106@{ub}

Hi, folks,

want versatility taken to the extreme ? Use this personnel card:


    @{b}BEAMING CLONE@{ub}

    Personnel, Non-aligned, rare, Dream Card.

    Integrity *
    Cunning *
    Strength *

    Gets all skills and stats of one personnel of your choice at this
    outpost.

@{i}"Transporter Duplicates are the result of failed beaming under adverse cir-
cumstances. They share not only their DNA but also their memories with the
original."@{ui}

Picture: Two identical Starfleet Officers facing each other.


This is not a card for the beginner as it requires a good amount of planning
to use. First what you can NOT do with it: You cannot use it to get the @{"Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"}
or @{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} you urgently need when he's still buried in the draw deck. You can
only duplicate a personnel card already in play.

Situation one:
You want to form two crews, each with a @{"Roga Danar" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD18"}. No
trouble - clone him.

Situation two:
You need two of a skill you have only once (Diplomacy?). Clone the one person
with the skill.

Situation three:
You are playing a treaty deck. Your Rommie crew needs some Federation
support but you don't get the treaty card. Clone your Feddie and transfer
him to the Romulan ship (he's still non-aligned!)

The trouble with this: Timing! Once played, this clone can never again change
the person he mimicks. So play it too early and get stuck with a bad choice.
(However, there is a way out. Find a way to kill the clone and @{"Res-Q" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD28"} it.)


Favorite combo(s):

- Beaming clone + @{"Res-Q" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD28"}: Nice shapechanger

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #107@{ub}

Hi, folks,

my last "Dream Card" is a fun card. It features a character I imagined for
a fan movie parody. Here comes:


    @{b}CATHERINE McCAT@{ub}

    Personnel, Non-aligned, rare, Dream card.

    Integrity 3
    Cunning 7
    Strength 1/2 (Yes that's one half!)

    SCIENCE, Anthropology x2, Biology, Greed, Empathy x1/2, Mouse-Hunting x3

@{i}"Catherine is the result of a failed genetic experiment by @{"Wes Crusher" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"} to
give a cat speech. Although the prime goal was achieved, LT. CMDR. McCat has
also learned to think!"@{ui}

Picture: A white beautiful Angora Cat.


No game review, but a character review (and a "how-to" to transfer your
character ideas into STCCG Dream Cards):

SCIENCE: I had to give her a classification and CIVILIAN was ruled out by the
flavor text ("Lt.Cmdr"). Also, SECURITY and OFFICER didn't seem viable choices
either. ENGINEER and MEDICAL were ruled out by her cat's paws (Dexterity!) and
she obviously is no V.I.P. So that's what remained.

Anthropology x2: As all cat lovers will know, cats know humans very well and
exhibit a lot of character. So I gave her a big chunk of the "Human science".

Biology: Well, she is a scientist, isn't she ?

Greed: A typically feline trait. Especially Greed for comfort.

Empathy x1/2: Full empathy would be game-breaking, but the forethought cats
often exhibit almost suggests some empathy. (Also nice for taming
@{"Nick Hathaway" link COTD101} [@{"#101" link COTD101}], as these two nicely complement each other, skill-wise.)

Mouse-Hunting x3: Well, obviously a fun skill. But wait! We're stuck with
another useless skill in STCCG: Barbering. So, let's make this one useful
and take Mouse-Hunting with it. We will need another card that is both hairy
and concerns hunting little animals. So, what would obviously be the best
choice ?

Right: Trouble with Tribbles. Dilemma, Either. Unless Barbering or Mouse-
Hunting present, Away team is stopped here for three full turns.

The Attributes: 1/2 STR is self-explanatory, 3 INT is given because of the
Greed and the animal traits and 7 CUN reflects her thinking ability and her
sharp instincts.


Favorite combo(s):

- Catherine + @{"Nick Hathaway" link COTD101}. Great Team, less killing.


Rating : 7.5


And the promised "how-to" ?

Step by step.
1) Select a classification that best fits your needs. Consider all seven
before making a choice. If two seem equally good, make it a double
classification.
2) Select one to three existing skills that can be justified for your chosen
character.
3) If feasible, create a Dream Skill that (perhaps a little funnily) describes
your character. Make up a Dilemma, Mission, or event that makes use of that
skill.
4) In the light of your skill selection, choose the attributes.

ONCE AGAIN A WORD OF CAUTION (and a disclaimer):
Whenever you create Dream Cards for STCCG, be aware that the materials you use
are copyrighted and trademarked by Decipher and Paramount. You can talk about
your ideas and publish them over the 'net. When you actually make them into a
physical card, make sure that at least one real STCCG card ends up in your
realisation of the Dream card (most easily by just creating the face and
glueing it to an existing back.) Never do create multiple copies of those
cards and it is a big NO NO to ever sell any of these cards.<BR>
[Why this works is, you do not copy anything, you actually mutilate one of
your originals, which you, as the owner are allowed to do. But selling these
defaced cards would be selling a derivative work which is forbidden.]

Disclaimer: The STCCG Dream cards presented in the COTD articles #100 to #107
are for fun use only and not intended as a challenge to any copyrights owned

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #108@{ub}

Hi, folks,

my "Dream Cards" severely lacked in one category, but this series shall not,
so I've chosen a ship for today:


    @{b}U.S.S. NEBULA@{ub}

    Ship, Federation, Common.

    Range 8
    Weapons 7
    Shields 8

    Holodeck, Tractor Beam. Requires One Command(*) and One Staff (+).

@{i}"Modern class of ship featuring large upper equipment modules customizable for
specific mission needs."@{ui}


One of the better commons. Almost as good as the basic Galaxy (only one less
Shields) for one less crewmember, sounds like a bargain to me...

But of course, it's a common. So we should (unfortunately) be able to do
better by using an equivalent rare or uncommon. But-SURPRISE, the Nebula class
rare (Phoenix) and the uncommon (Sutherland) are actually WORSE cards!!!
(I actually suppose this is an error card- they got it one place too high and
wanted to make her a 7/6/7 which would fit the usual pattern of rare ships
being 1-2 places better than their common counterparts.) Nonetheless, we are
to play the card as printed, so let's make the best of it.

What are the uses for this ship ?

1) In fast mission-oriented decks: Play this instead of a runabout to have a
nice little crewmover if your opponent plays something else than Feds. The
extra shields will serve you well and it's two points faster than an Excelsior
and one better than a @{"Hood" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD82"} (which also need two crew). Make sure you have
enough cards with command ability, though. Also an alternative to the Galaxy
if your opponent plays few dilemmas and you can form small crews.

2) In Holo-Decks: The smallest ship that can use Holograms.

3) In multi-player games: Linking ship to move crew over large distances.
Needs two people to fly, so you won't be carrying too many crew you don't
really want to take along.

A good sideboard card.


Favorite combo(s):

- Nah. None here.

Not too bad an idea. But I'd
rather have some holo which is a little more useful in general play. Unless
I am desperate for @{"Nutational shields" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD40"}, I normally have enough ENGINEERS. And
if I look beyond ENGINEERing, there are better cards (one of which will be
discussed tomorrow:-) ).

b) Space missions.
Good, where are her SKILLS ???
And with everybody complaining that we don't have enough variety in the basic
mix of cards, was it really necessary to have a holo recreation of a card we
have as the real thing ? And both RARE ? Might have made a neat little addi-
tion to HOLODECK ADVENTURES, but not to the basic set.

Hi, folks,

how about a GOOD holo then ?


    @{b}ALBERT EINSTEIN@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare, Hologram, universal.

    Integrity 9
    Cunning 11
    Strength 2

    SCIENCE, Physics x 2, Astrophysics.

@{i}"Re-creation of the famous 20th century human. Author of the Theory of
Relativity."@{ui}


Best thing about him: He's a STCCG player! (Look very closely, if you haven't
heard about this before - it was one of the Easter Eggs.)

Game-wise, two second places concerning attribute values. Integrity 9 (only
@{"Kahless" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD27"} has 10) and Cunning 11 (against @{"Data's" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"} 12) on the same card aren't too
crappy. SCIENCE, Physics and Astrophysics are also quite useful, especially
on space missions, but that's what you use holos for anyway (unless you are
redshirting, but in this case neither of the Feddie Holograms is too good.)
Of course, his Strength 2 just sux, but as I said, you're out in space and
I suppose you don't do too much battle there and there aren't very many space
missions that require Strength (One to be exact!)

Too bad we didn't get the Hawking card ! (Integrity 8, Cunning 12, Strength 1
SCIENCE x2, Astrophysics x3 ???) Does anybody know whether Hawking himself
rejected the idea or whether Decipher just never considered it ?
Nice card for a space mission deck.

Hi, folks,

can you say "useless"? I knew you can. Can you also say


    @{b}WARP CORE BREACH@{ub}

    Event, rare.

Plays on any ship, except @{"Borg ship" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD2"}. Ship explodes at end of owner's next turn
unless ENGINEER aboard by then. Discard after use.

@{i}"In warp propulsion systems, if the magnetic confinement filed collapses,
matter and antimatter collide causing the ship to explode."@{ui}


Oops, RARE ??? And EVENT ??? They didn't mean this, did they ? Granted, it's
one of the few cards that have dilemma-like effects without actually being a
dilemma, but it's so WEAK!

As an interrupt, not costing you an entire turn, this might have been nice.
Nonetheless, quick analysis what you CAN do with it:

1) Throw it on an empty ship at an outpost. If your opponent does not have
   any ENGINEERS ready, she's probably going to lose that ship. Good against
   decks with few ships.

2) Throw it on an empty ship at a mission location to stall. Check before that
   your opponent still has need to ever leave that location again (i.e. cannot
   reach 100 by just solving the present mission.

3) Throw on an empty (or poorly manned) ship, then Temporal Rift it. BOOM.
   (Took two cards and a turn, however.)

Neither of these seems too great to me. Nah. Better add something else to my
deck.


Favorite combo(s):

- Warp core Breach + Temporal Rift. At least it works.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #112@{ub}

Hi, folks,

this card has a little more to it than it first seems:


    @{b}SUBSPACE SCHISM@{ub}

    Interrupt, uncommon.

Play within five seconds of either player's card draw. That player must dis-
card that card and redraw.

@{i}"Solanagen-based aliens from another subspace domain accessed our space to
abduct people for experiments."@{ui}


Now this one requires some depth: A card that can be used on either player.
So, let's first assume I use it on myself.

Approach #1: I draw a bad card and want to get rid of it. No problem, play
Subspace Schism, discard, replace. But then, I could have drawn something
useful instead of the Subspace Schism in first place. DOH. Not worth it.

Approach #2: I want to play a deck with less than 30 draw deck cards. Here's
a use. Subspace Schism is a neutral card I can well use to reduce my deck
size if that's my aim. Remember, I can use it on itself! So this should not
be dismissed, especially if I have lots of Bridge crew. Disadvantage: Cannot
use it on the first seven cards, so any that come up early will hurt me. Still
a possible strategy.

That's it for this side, try it the other way round. Now my OPPONENT is my
target.

Approach #3: Deny her a good card. To do this I must know what she has just
drawn. Several possibilities here:

3a: Play a @{"Thought Maker" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD12"} on her. Place a vital card on top of the deck (let's
say her only Juggler), then lots of crap. Let her draw, Subspace Schism.
3b: Use Jaglom Shrek and a good memory. @{"Alien probe" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD133"} works as well.
3c: Wait until she uses her @{"Betazoid Gift Box" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD9"}. Definitely a good card drawn
here (might be illegal, though.)

Approach #4: The double nasty shot. Situation: You have a nasty event card on
the table. Opponent draws, smiles and throws a @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} on your event
(of course NOT waiting the five seconds!!!). Smile back, fire your Subspace
Schism. TOO bad for her... (Make sure she really played the card she had just
drawn. Many players will fall for this. Works great for @{"Red Alerts" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}, too.)
Defense against this: ALWAYS wait 5 seconds after your card draw before
playing a card...

The card adds some kind of Poker element to the game. It's really a bluffing
card.


Favorite combo(s):

- Subspace Schism + a hasty opponent. Works great.

Hi, folks,

something green:

    Integrity 4
    Cunning 7
    Strength 7

    OFFICER, Treachery, Exobiology, Command Star (*).

@{i}"Commander of the warbird Devoras. Aided the escape of Romulan operative Selok
from the Federation."@{ui}


This card has one single reason for its existence: Exobiology. Treachery is
as common as dirt among Romulans, OFFICER is not the best classification and I
can get decent attributes from other cards. He's not even Firestorm-proof.
Exobiology however is almost unique among Rommies and only one non-aligned
(Baran) has it.
Do I at least need it ? Lessee:

Investigate Raid. 35 points for Exobiology and Diplomacy. Both rare skills,
but acceptable if I might find some other uses (Diplomacy is vital for
@{"Q-Nets" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD86"}, so I only have to check Exobiology).

@{"Investigate Sighting" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD63"}. Treachery + Exobiology + CUNNING >40 ??? Too hard for
a measly 35. Should have been a 40.

Investigate Anomaly. Exobiology + STRENGTH>35 ? A typical beginner's card with
three affiliations. Common and only 30 points. And no decent Feddie deck has
any trouble with it.

Result: Three rather mediocre missions for a character I cannot use for any
other purpose. Not a bargain. Next.

BTW: I cannot even say I need the Exobiology as Takket will be a staple in
EVERY Romulan deck (only non-holo Doctor!)

Command ability and a recommendation from the theme deck department (@{"Worf" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD35"}

Computer Skill and Navigation, if nothing else, are little life insurances,
even more so if you play space mission decks. (And don't forget the
embarrassment of being nailed with an impassable door)

Honor and Diplomacy are the good old Klingon virtues, quite common, but then
you can use multiples of both. (Wormhole Negotiations, anyone ?) Try Cloaked
Mission with Kurn (esay 30 points) or send him with a few muscle types to
solve the Krios suppression. Secret Salvage would also be an option (one more
Navigation).

A staple in every Klingon deck.

Ever wished for a @{"Sela" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD23"} in your non-Romulan decks ? This is about as close as
you can get to the most famous Rommie without having to play green cards.
Diplomacy and Leadership are a good, though not very rare combination. Three
fair stats make for solid support. For the Anthropology, well, we'd better
find some uses for it, like in a Cultural Observation (Much better than @{"Vash" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD88"}
or @{"Nick Rozhenko" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD81"} here), Investigate Alien Probe (although Koroth would be a
better choice here) or New Contact. (Wow, use ALL THREE skills here. Just add
a @{"Devinoni Ral" link COTD142} for Empathy.) But that's it.

Uses ? For a Klingon deck: Sure, especially if you play the last two missions
mentioned above. For a Federation deck: One of several exchangeable support
cards though a good choice if you're short on Bridge crew or rares in general.
For a Romulan deck: Quite nil, unless you are desperate to use New Contact.
For a treaty deck: Great, especially if playing red/green. Add him to whatever
crew and score 40 for New Contact on the fly-by.

Neither a beginner's card (you need a few uncommon/rare missions to make good
use of him) nor a card that will occur too often in high-level tournament
play. But good for anything inbetween.

Hi, folks,

this one is a straightforward Dilemma (really running out of interesting
cards...)


    @{b}ARCHER@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet, common.

Away Team member with highest total attribute numbers is shot and dies unless
SECURITY and MEDICAL present. Discard Dilemma.

@{i}"Indigenous inhabitants, such as this Mintakan bowman, often attack an away
team out of fear."@{ui}


Simple to use, simple to review:

What it does: It eliminates one crewmember. A good one, too. Especially
against Fed decks this one can wreak havoc, as the Bridge crew all have really
high scores. If present, you nail @{"Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"}, next would be @{"Worf" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD35"} then @{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"}.
After this the card remains unclear. @{"Beverly" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD22"}, @{"Geordi" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD32"} and @{"W.Riker" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD19"} all have the
same total score, so which one is actually shot ? (Don't know, but it's
probably in the FAQ.)

What it takes: A Security (hard to come by, at least for Feds) and a Medical
(nobody beams anywhere without one of these). Enhance with a few @{"Love interests" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD74"}
and you might stand a good chance of your male Security or your female
Medical being affected. (So use those Tashas and Simon Tarses, make for a
little surprise concerning those cards). One of those that sometimes work, but
not too often.

Where to place: Planets. Better choice, at least with all these artifact decks
floating around.

Where to put it: In any Dilemma-heavy deck.


Favorite combo(s):

- Archer + @{"Male Love Interest" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD74"}. Let's get the Security guy first...

- Archer + Microvirus + Anaphasic Organism + any mission I want to sneak into

Hi, folks,

another cheapo Rommie Commie:


    @{b}VAREL@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan, common.

    Integrity 4
    Cunning 7
    Strength 5

    SCIENCE, Physics, Computer Skill, Youth. Staff Star (+). Universal.

"Representative of female Romulans trained in the field of Science. Assigned
to assist with @{"Interphase Generator" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD15"} project."


Yawn. 4/7/5. Another one of those yelling for Thermal Deflectors or an
Integrity enhancer card. Getting repetitive, isn't it ?

At least the skills are worth talking about a little. SCIENCE is one of the
two classifications most decks have trouble with (Only @{"N'Vek" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD67"} and Tarus have
it amongst the Rommies, the former is uncommon and not universal, the latter
only has one skill and a bad one, too.) Youth is WAY too common amongst
the green cards to be useful, but Physics and Computer Skill are not too crap-
py. Once again, @{"Relief Mission" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD64"} is the key here. A nice hiding-place for an
artifact you need early. So Physics comes in very handy. Apart from that,
Computer Skill is the one that always gets your hair off your head when you
lack it (Impassable Door). Also the only one that helps in the rare missions.
A card that has a few uses when you play with mainly commons and uncommons
but quickly loses its appeal once you have the rare Rommie-only missions.


Favorite combo(s):

- None. A pure filler card unless playing an all-common deck.
- Phil's favorite combo: @{"Female love interest" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD64"} + Varel instead of @{"Sela" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD23"} :-)

Hi, folks,

@{"Archer's" link COTD116} older brother (Thanx for the intro, Jack!):


    @{b}NAUSICAANS@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet, uncommon.

Three Nausicaans pick a fight. One away team member is killed (random selec-
tion) unless Strength > 44. Discard Dilemma.

@{i}"Tall humanoid species with a quick temper. A Nausicaan once stabbed
@{"Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} through the heart with a knife."@{ui}


Should have read "Kills the away team member with the highest number of skills
(random if tie)" just for realism...

But unfortunately this isn't the case, so let's stick with what we have.
The effect is one more on the list of the dead. Unfortunately not very
selective, so you often get somebody you didn't care about. Too bad.

But compared with all the others that just kill one away team member this
one holds quite well. Of course, Armus is certain, but he does not stop the
away team as this one does. Rebel encounter is about the same thing (darn)
but it leaves the opponent with the choice to sacrifice an equipment instead.
Menthar Booby Trap is way too easy. And that's about it.

Most often, the stopping effect is the thing you go for anyway. A turn can be
much more valuable than a random personnel card.

STRENGTH > 44 is at least a requirement even larger teams can have a little
trouble with. So chances are you'll get something out of this one. No much,
but a man and a turn.

A regular choice for my dilemma-heavy decks.


Favorite combo(s):

Hi, folks,

a beaming clone that is not a Dream Card:


    @{b}THOMAS RIKER@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 7
    Strength 6

    OFFICER, Leadership, Navigation, Geology, Music. Command Star (*).

@{i}"Lt. Commander Thomas Riker is @{"William Riker's" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD19"} double. Created
during a transporter accident in 2361."@{ui}


Hey, he should have Youth skill. At seven years, he's probably the youngest
Starfleet officer ever! :-)

First thing to do is let's compare him to the real thing. One less Strength
(Why? He had to survive in a hostile environment!), no Diplomacy, no Honor
(both somewhat understandable), but an added Geology (he needed THAT to
survive!).

Seems to me the losses are a lot bigger than the gains. Rather use the real
thing, he's much better. Unless of course...

a) you are not that rich and cannot shell out lotsa bucks for a @{"Will Riker" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD19"}.
   In this case you might use a Tom instead. Problem is, he's not that much
   cheaper.

b) you need two Rikers. A Riker is a watered-down @{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"}, anyway... So if
   you need leaders for three teams, pick Tom for the third.

Hi, folks,

here's another poor man's card:


    J'DDAN

    Personnel, Klingon, common.

    Integrity 2
    Cunning 6
    Strength 6

    SCIENCE, Exobiology, Treachery, Staff Star (+), universal.

@{i}"Klingon trained in the field of science. Smuggled Federation secrets to the
Romulans in the form of amino acid codes."@{ui}


This one actually makes sense. At least he has one skill that can be useful
to many Klingon decks. Exobiology, to be exact. The only other one that has
it is Nu'Daq, but he's only an OFFICER, so not of much use during Dilemmas.

Treachery is another one of these, but this is less useful if you have a full
set including rares, as you get @{"Lursa" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD54"} and @{"B'Etor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD55"} (not only do they have better
skills, they also have larger t*ts...:-) ). If you don't have them, stick with
this little common.

A staff star is better than nil (as all Klingon ships do have a requirement
for Staff), and being universal could actually help with this card given the
chronical Klingon lack of SCIENCE.

Stats: Big Arrgh. Integrity 2 ????? Firestorm ????? Cunning and Strength 6
each ? Do Klingons come any weaker than this ? (Yes, they do. Ba'El at 4 and
K'mpec and K'Tal at 5 each.)


Favorite combo(s):

- J'Ddan + @{"Investigate Sighting" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD63"} in a treaty deck. That is if I ever play a
  deck that weak.

    Cunning 7
    Strength 9

    SECURITY, Geology, Youth, Staff Star (+), universal.

@{i}"Romulan trained in the field of Security. A former member of the Tal Shiar

Whatcha ? Cheap ? Yes. Good ? No. For the same price I can get something
better. A Taul to be exact (Treachery is more useful than Youth and
Archaeology helps if you really want to try the DNA hunt).

Did somebody say @{"Wind Dancer" link COTD127} (Needs Youth or Music or Strength >9)? Well, did
I catch you without a @{"Varel" link COTD117} ? If so, you'd better have a @{"Sela" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD23"} and a @{"Taibak" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD85"}...

But, impossible enough, this card HAS a use.
If you play for fast artifacts, nothing beats having a little @{"Relief Mission" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD64"}.
And that one needs... Geology or Physics! Once again, you'd better use @{"Varel" link COTD117}
(she has Physics), but I wanted to have a FAST artifact, so I'd better have
a backup card that is still useful afterwards, and so I prefer Jaron (SECURITY)
to Thei (OFFICER).

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #123@{ub}

Hi, folks,

another card for a Klingon battle deck:


    @{b}KLINGON DEATH YELL@{ub}

    Interrupt, rare.

Plays on any just killed Klingon with Honor. Yell to warn the dead and earn 5
bonus points. May play only one death yell for each such Klingon.

@{i}"Warning for the dead to beware; a Klingon warrior is about to arrive. In
Klingon myth, killed warriors with honor go to Sto-Vo-Kor. Dishonored dead
go to Gre'thor."@{ui}


Three rules clarifications:
1) You can use this with @{"Worf" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD35"}.
2) You can use this on your opponent's Klingons
3) From the card text you have TO ACTUALLY YELL to gain the bonus. Tell that
   your next opponent in a tourney, preferably if the audience is large :-)
   (Make sure the Yell is loud enough for the dead to hear!)

Fact (3) is the one that makes this card cool. You have quite a few options
to use it. Besides the prosaic effect of gaining 5 points, you can get rid
of some frustration (if your own card got killed) or triumph (if your Dilemma
just hit home). Be creative in word choice :-)

Second, pointing out that little fact mentioned can embarrass your opponent
enough to make her committ a mistake or two after she played the card...

Last, in a round robin tournament, wait until your most feared opponent starts
her turn before using it in your game. You will probably cause lots of confu-
sion.

Besides that, a boring card. No better than the particle fountain. But WAY
COOL if played correctly.

Hi, folks,

a Dilemma with a twist:


    @{b}TEMPORAL CAUSALITY LOOP@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space, rare.

    5 points.

Unless SCIENCE and CUNNING >35, undo your last two actions of this turn and
end turn. Discard Dilemma.

"Localized distortion causes time to repeat ad infinitum. U.S.S. Bozeman was

Oops, cute 'lil card. Not too easy to overcome, too. But this is not the best
use of it (though a possible one, at least you can gain a turn from it.)
But I can do much better. Use it as an "Oops". Seed it anywhere you want
to have it. Send some hapless little ensign with a shuttle, tell him to wait
there. If something REALLY NASTY happens to you (Say running into a
@{"Barclay's disease" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD29"} or similar disasters), just order him in.

He's back unhurt and so is your crew! (Two last actions: Sending the Ensign
and encountering the @{"Disease" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD29"}.) Fun enough, eh ? Using a Dilemma's negative
consequence in a positive way ? Be sure to surprise your opponent with this
one. They never see it coming and you'll pretty sure be King for the day (if
you forget to mention the source of this hint.) Try it, it's fun.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #125@{ub}

Hi, folks,

what was that number again ? 125 ?
[Yep.]
Does that really mean this is my 100th card of the day (after Habib's 25) ?
[Guess so.]
And probably you expect something special again.
[Nice Guess]
Great. I hate when this happens.
[Don't start getting sarcastic]
People get soo used to getting bonuses now and then.
[Oooh, PLEASE]
Well, then, persuaded. Two cards?
[Hey, Wes, we had that in @{"#40" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD40"}, so it's old hat.]
Three cards ?
[Don't you remember the incoming messages ?]
Four cards ?
[Sounds Okay to me, but I hope it's not the espionages.]
Don't worry, I've mentioned these in @{"#75" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD75"} as boring.
[(blush)]
[So what else ?]
Well, how about:


    @{b}SCAN (c)
    FULL PLANET SCAN (u)
    LIFEFORM SCAN (u)
    LONG-RANGE SCAN (c)@{ub}

    Interrupts.

Glance at the cards located under one space mission / located under one planet
mission / in your opponent's hand / aboard any ship for twenty (ten) seconds.

@{i}"Sensor instruments can detect life signs and molecular signatures at a
distance with accuracy."
"Sensor instruments can make detailed scans of a planet surface and atmosphere."
"A special form of sensor scan capable of detecting life-forms on planets or
in space."
"Detects ships and phenomena at interstellar distances using ship sensors."@{ui}


Yuck. So much text. Still, four cards, one purpose. Investigation. Of these
four, the Long-Range scan is definitely the weakest. Checking cards on a ship
serves as little more than a brain aide unless your opponent is doing lots
of crew transfers. The other three however fall into the "avoid nasty surpri-
ses" section. Nasty surprises like an Armus, a @{"Nagilum" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD51"} or a @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}.

How to profit from these:

1) In small crew decks, these can help finding the locations at which you can
safely attempt missions. Also, you can regrow them at interrupt speed (@{"Palor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD25"}),
which means you don't really need more than two of each. If you're playing
all planet or all space, even better.

2) If in a hurry and you cannot wait for a given crewmember, sneak peek before
risking something.

3) Look at opponent's hand before playing some critical event.
Note that you can duplicate the effects of these cards. An @{"Alien Probe" link COTD133} helps
you as much as a Lifeform scan and redshirting is an obvious way of "Scanning"
locations. However, you can use Life-Form Scan + Jaglom Shrek as an
@{"Alien Probe" link COTD133} that only exposes your opponent's hand!

IMHO, Full planet scan is the best of the four, as you can also find out
where your opponent has hidden a crucial artifact.

What I do not understand is the rarity distribution. For my taste, the two
mission scanners should have the same rarity (probably uncommon) and the two
hand/ship scans should be the same rarity (common?). This might have been a
SNAFU from Decipher's side (swapped two cards on the sheets) or maybe it has
been done on purpose. Don't really know.


Favorite combo(s):

- Jaglom Shrek + Life-Form Scan

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #126@{ub}

Hi, folks,

after a few of you (>100) convinced me that STCCG is not THAT dead, I guess
I am stuck with this forever :-)
Now, if Decipher at least gave me some cards for free so that I'd at least
get rid of PAYING for the stuff I am reviewing... (How about an AU box,
Warren ?)
Hrmph. Probably not, considering the royalties P*R*M**NT is charging them.

Before we get to business, some changes:
1) I have finished my studies and got no net access on weekends. So no
   COTD's on Saturdays or Sundays for some time.
2) We have a new web page. And it's better than the old one.
   (See below for the URL)
3) We will soon be on stccg.discussion-list, too. Just coordinating this.

OK. Card ? Well, still no AU out anywhere, so quite boring:


    @{b}VEKMA@{ub}

    Personnel, Klingon, common.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 5
    Strength 6

    MEDICAL, Honor, Staff Star (+)

@{i}"Klingon female trained in Klingon anatomy and medicine. Propositioned Comman-
der @{"William T. Riker" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD19"} on the @{"I.K.C. Pagh" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD70"} in 2365."@{ui}


A Common with two good skills. To be exact, MEDICAL and ...
... female!

Yep, our ridged friends are way short on babes, especially not-so-rare ones.
And they're also short on doctors. So why not combine these two traits into
one card ?

(BTW, the other Klingon ladies are the @{"Duras" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD54"} @{"sisters" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD55"}, @{"Kurak" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD76"} and Ba'El, the
latter of which is worse than crappy.) And any decent deck needs three women
in play to overcome the standard @{"Love Interest" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD74"} / @{"Matriarchal Society" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD50"} combo.

So choices are not that great which actually makes Vekma close to unavoidable,
as @{"Lursa" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD54"} is not that good, either (Leadership is OK, Geology might some-
times be nice, but besides that zilch, and don't forget the Firestorms!)
Honor is a nice gift, too, especially when combined with @{"Death Yells" link COTD123} or
@{"Honor challenges" link COTD144}, and at least Integrity is >5...

The other medical alternative is Divok, but Youth is pretty worthless and
Biology needs appropriate missions (although there are four Klingon missions
that can use Biology).

For me the decision on which Doc to use in my red decks is easy: both :-)


Favorite combo(s):

- Vekma + Divok + @{"Genetronic Replicator" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"}. Did somebody say Dilemma ???

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #127@{ub}

Hi, folks,

so your suicide plans have been proven unneccessary ? :-)
Good. Wouldn't want to lose the last few STCCG players...
On to business:


    @{b}WIND DANCER@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet, rare.

To get past, Lwaxan(n)a Troi must be present OR at least one Away Team member
must have: Youth OR Music OR STRENGTH>9.

@{i}"Sentry of the Parallax Colony. Only allows those whose hearts are joyous
to pass."@{ui}


Keyword of the day: OR. Never seen so many OR's one one "Dilemma". Let's do
a quick analysis:

Out of 58 Feds, 16 have one or more of the required skills.
For Klingons, the ratio is 9 of 37, for Romulans it's 6 of 27.
Non-aligneds contribute another 3 of 15 to this statistic.

So what ? A probability of about 25% that any randomly chosen crewmember will
get past this alone ? An about 25% chance that any randomly assembled team of
four will NOT be able to pass ? Oops.

And that's about it. As the skills required for this particular "Dilemma" are
not very useful elsewhere it will pretty much come close to random selection
when determining whether you have one needed skill or not. Duh.

BTW: This card originally called for "smiling" characters to pass. I ran a
quick check on that one to find:
Fed 6/58, Klin 1/37, Rom 3/27 and NAl 1/15. Now this would have made for a
good Dilemma, but I understand they did not want the hassle of assembling
a list of which characters are considered "smiling" (I used a rather broad
interpretation of "smile" to find the above numbers). So they took a *GREAT*
card and made it a lousy card. (Why all these OR's ?) Why not just stick with
Lwaxana OR Youth ?

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #128@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here comes another one:


    @{b}TSIOLKOVSKY INFECTION@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space, rare.

Place aboard ship. It is now infected. Mission can continue but all personnel,
while aboard, lose their first-listed skill. Cure with 3 MEDICAL to discard.

@{i}"Variety of water-based Psi 2000 virus. Passed by perspiration. Creates dan-
gerous intoxication-like instability among a crew."@{ui}


Yes, this card is annoying :-)

And most personnel really lose something valuable. Their best skill in most
cases. The bad thing about it, it is not for long. At least in most cases.
Ya see, it goes away once the crew has left the ship and boarded another one.
The *ship* is still infected, but the crew regains their full health. (not
very realistic, btw) Also, for the same reason, it does not distract from
any skill relevant to planet missions (crew is off ship, so no disease)
And it does not even stop the crew, it just sits there...

But wait, this could actually be the key for some creative uses! If I place
it before a Dilemma that requires some skills (not classifications), I might
cause a lot of trouble! (They HAVE to go on! ) So let's try that.

@{"Q" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD30"} could be a good choice (leadership), @{"Nagilum" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD51"} might prove even better against
Feds; Shaka, Gravitic Mine and Null Space also gain some momentum. So THAT's
how to gain some serious advantage from it...

Oh, BTW: There are a few personnel which are close to immune from this thing.
First of all (and well in line with the episode) there's @{"Wesley" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"}, who loses
his Youth (!) instead of his ENGINEERing or Computer Skill, to a lesser extent
the two @{"Duras" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD55"} @{"sisters" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD56"} (Treachery), @{"Toral" link COTD120} (his half Leadership), @{"Mendak" link COTD113} (again
Treachery), Movar and Taul (ditto), Etana Jol (yet again Treachery), Baran and
Bok (the absolutely useless Greed) and last not least @{"Ocett" link COTD80} (Archaeology
instead of Honor or Navigation).
(And this proves that Decipher at least SOMETIMES thinks before creating
cards :-) )

- Tsiolkovsky Infection + Shaka (makes for a cute little "No, you don't")

Hi, folks,

it's well past midnight now, but I'm not gonna let you sit there without a
COTD tomorrow, so here it comes (forgive me any typos):


    @{b}ICONIAN COMPUTER WEAPON@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space, Common

Unless SCIENCE present, re-boot by discarding all non-personnel cards in hand
and replenish from top of draw deck. Discard Dilemma.

@{i}"Highly destructive virus from the ancient extinct Iconians. Transmitted to
target vessels via a probe."@{ui}


To quote Lore: "They call this a Dilemma ?"

Yep, and still this card might be useful in some situations. Not that any
player worth this name would use this on an OPPONENT, but how about getting
some use out of it YOURSELF ?

Let's assume you're playing a really fast deck. And you now desperately want
to run out of cards because you're ahead on points but your opponent is
catching up. Just send a redshirt crew (without SCIENCE of course) to what-
ever location you just strategically placed this little card. Then happily
discard four, five or even six cards from your hand and draw to your heart's
content. Net result: A few less turns for your opponent to catch up in.

Of course, this also works the other way round, but you cannot assume your
opponent will go in there without any SCIENCE. Nope. Use it for yourself.
(You can also employ this in the early game stages to get rid of unwanted
cards and hopefully draw something better.)

And the advantage of this thingy over an event: You get exactly when you need
it. No sooner, no later. And it does not cost you a draw deck card.

Hi, folks,

some Klingon stuff:


    @{b}KLINGON RIGHT OF VENGEANCE@{ub}

    Interrupt, common.

If any Klingon is killed in an away team battle, all other Klingons present
may immediately re-attack with double STRENGTH.

@{i}"Under Klingon law, @{"Lieutenant Worf" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD35"} claimed right of vengeance against Duras
in 2367."@{ui}


Uh, that wording is a little confused. Actually, if I only had the lower half
of this card I'd say it must be an event. Yep, it doesn't say I have to play
this upon the Death of a Klingon and it does not say it goes away. (Sure,
that's picky, but there are interrupts that linger around. Try Escape Pod for
an example.)

But let's for this review assume it's intended as most people play it. When
one of your Klingons is killed, you can reattack and double your STRENGTH.
Great. So either you have a Federation team with @{"Worf" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD35"}, K'Eleyhr and Alexander
(which now at maximum gives you a 34 Str attack - not 38 as one of your
Klingons just bit the dust), or you're playing Klingons in which
case I don't understand how you ever got into a situation where one of your
away team crew is killed in battle - don't you have enough STRENGTH ?

And what do you get off it even IF it works ? One opposing away team member
killed. Battle probably continues next turn. You're probably still on the
losing side. Your crew still dies.

Uh, so much for crap factor. Really, it does not do anything sensible.

Hi, folks,

a card for those of you who always longed to see the old uniforms back:


    @{b}MORGAN BATESON@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare, should have been AU but isn't.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 4
    Strength 5

    OFFICER, Leadership, Stellar Cartography, Command Star (*)

@{i}"Captain Morgan Bateson was in command of the U.S.S. Bozeman when it was
caught in a temporal causality loop from 2278 to 2368."@{ui}


Um, rare ? Looks more like a not-so-great uncommon to me. But at least there
is a deck type he might be able to complement: The nasty little surprise play
with 6 space missions. (Ya know, everybody now knows about the 6-planet trick
and there are lots of players using 80%+ planet dilemmas, so go for the
inverse thing...)

Stellar Cartography is the keyword here, use it for Study Nebula,
@{"Study Stellar Collision" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD65"}, Survey Mission (if playing dual-affiliation or espionage) and
of course the inevitable Explore Black Cluster - there aren't that many one-
man crews that can do a mission alone and as you're probably not expecting
too many dilemmas, those quickies really can boost your score.

With AU, the Leadership / Officer qualification will also be of some use,
as Morgan may lead a Fed force into battle, let's see what happens...

Stats: Nothing to talk about a lot. Good integrity, average rest.

PS: For those of you who do also play other card games: Use your STCCG cards
for good measure as follows:

1) Playing On the Edge ? Remember that "Copyright Violation" combo from
last CONJURE ? We can do better. Throw a Hunt for DNA Program - you'll get
a 40 / 55 Character for just 3 cost !

(Alternative: Sarthong Plunder 40/35 for 2, and no, there is unfortunately
no way to get one of the year designations into the second slot with a low
number in front of it :-( )

And shame on us trekkies: This wins no better that second place. Illuminati
is an even better choice. Try Telephone Psychics: 1 (for) 900 / 6. Sorry
for the off-topic.

2) Not playing that ? Well, I assume you're at least playing Magic:

(This one is a little more expensive than the previous one)

Start with a good Magic deck. Add a Ring of Ma'Ruf and a Eureka. Play the Ring
to get any outside card (well, we take one from STCCG of course), then cast
your Eureka, which lets you put any permanent (=creature, enchantment or ar-
tif... wait ... ARTIFACT ?) into play at no cost. Now we just need a single
artifact that makes no reference to STCCG terms not mentioned in Magic. All
of them but one reference either Ships, Event, Draw Deck (which Magic calls
Library) or Equipment. But, Horga'hn does not !!! And, it has a whopping
effect !!!!! Permanent Time Walk !

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #132@{ub}

Hi, folks,

new day, new COTD:


    @{b}VULCAN MINDMELD@{ub}

    Interrupt, uncommon.

Allows all Mindmeld personnel, at one location, to add to their skills. For
one turn, add all of the skills of another personel who is present.

@{i}"Ancient Vulcan ritual which telepathically links minds to intimately share
each other's thoughts and knowledge."@{ui}


Another "Oops" card. Very useful if you need TWO of something but of course
only have one. Just too bad you always need a Mindmelder to use it and this
rather limits the uses of this cute little interrupt.

Quick Mindmeld index:

Feds:
Sarek (R): Not bad, lotsa Diplomacy.
Satelk (R): 1/3 of a Picard.
Dr. Selar (U): At least a Medical, always useful.
T'Pan (U): Double Science but nothing else. Note that she has Mindmeld only
from Beta unlimited upwards. The older versions do not have that skill.

Klingons:
Zip.

Romulans:
Nil.

Non-aligned:
Nada.

So this should go in every Klingon and Romulan deck, shouldn't it :-) ?
No, seriously. Two decent personnel can make use of a mindmeld. So it's de-
finitively worth considering if you have both in play (2 @{"Datas" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"} and 2 @{"Picards" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"}
at one location for that turn?) and somewhat useful if you have at least
one of them. However, you can never rely on it, as there are far too many
ways of rendering it useless. Besides @{"Amanda" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD31"}, all things that somehow stop
a crew are equally effective, so the best use of it is against a Dilemma
that would otherwise affect you.


Favorite combo(s):

- @{"Sarek" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD72"} + Selar + Mindmeld + 2 decent personnel (I'd suggest @{"Wesley" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"} and @{"Vekor" link "STCCG:cotd400.guide/COTD373"})

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #133@{ub}

Hi, folks,

let's have a look at a card they shamelessly copied from Magic:


    @{b}ALIEN PROBE@{ub}

    Event, uncommon.

Plays on table. Both players continue the game with their hands (cards)
exposed, face up on the table.

@{i}"Space probes of unknown origin are frequently encountered by starships. Often
such probes seek information or contact."@{ui}


Revelation for STCCG. Neat. Now of course this one has a good effect (you
see your opponent's cards) and a bad effect (your opponent sees your cards).
The question is now who gains more from it.

Obviously, the less cards you have in hand, the less anyone is going to see
by means of this. Also, the fewer surprises your deck contains, the better
for you. So decks with few interrupts but fast cardplay benefit most from
this card.

So you'll need a @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} to start with and then a deck that's heavy on per-
sonnel, ships and equipment. Sounds like a Klingon or Romulan deck to me.
(The Feds have such good Personnel that you can probably play with quite a
low number of them)

Best application is obviously a Klingon attack deck with lotsa small ships.
This also has the advantage of not needing to be very fast (your opponent
won't get to do anything), so you are not in dire need of a @{"Traveler" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD4"} which
in turn helps keeping your hand size low. Result: You always know when it's
safe to play a key event (no @{"Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}) or Interrupt (no @{"Amanda" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD31"}).

Then of course, there's the infamous Telepathic Alien Kidnappers / Alien
Probe Combo. So much has been written about it, I won't repeat it here.
Just our house rule for that one: When both cards are in play, you get to
turn your cards face down and shuffle before each guess. Then cards are
placed openly again. (So it still remains a guess!) However, there still is
a huge advantage as you can always guess the most common card type or the one
that could hurt you most.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #134@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's yesterday's card, written today because I lacked the time. So all
you addicts should still get your next dose in time.


    @{b}THEI@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan, common, universal.

    Integrity 4
    Cunning 6
    Strength 8

    OFFICER, Geology, Physics, Command Star (*)

@{i}"Subcommander Thei is representative of officers serving in the Romulan Star
Empire. Ally of the sisters of Duras during the Klingon Civil War."@{ui}


Now, had they only placed a five in that strategical position instead of
a four! Then, we might have had a good card, as I don't think Thermal
Deflectors will be THAT great in effect (Why ? Well, Firestorm looks for
Thermal Deflectors PRESENT, so I assume they must be played on a location.
But then, it's listed as EVENT, which makes it not so terribly useful when
the Dilemma has just hit you. Should have been an equipment or artifact...)

So, again we have a non-firestorm-proof Rommie. Two skills to go with.
Unfortunately really redundant as long as the best application for them is
concerned: @{"Relief mission" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD64"} (stuffed with several artifacts).
Other chances? Rare Romulan Missions: Nil. Uncommon Romulan Missions: Nil
again. Common Romulan Missions: Nil once more.

SO WHAT FOR ???

Nope. forget it. Any player with some wits will firestorm that @{"Relief Mission" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD64"}
anyway, so a Rommie won't have access to a first-turn Horga'Hn.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #135@{ub}

Hi, folks,

if you think you are still susceptible to COTD overdoses, stop reading
here and continue after at least two hours. If you're already hooked, read
on quickly:


    @{b}PATTERN ENHANCERS@{ub}

    Event, common.

Plays on table. Allows your personnel and equipment unlimited beaming through
atmospheric ionization or distortion fields.

@{i}"Devices which amplify transporter signals to enhance transporter beam in
hazardous areas."@{ui}


Another counterspell card. Nullifies two other events, and at least all of
them at once. So if (and that's a big if, of course) somebody plays a deck
with 5 ionizations and 7 @{"distortion fields" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD99"}, you need just this one card
to counter them all. Good.

On the other hand, I've already reviewed the @{"Distortion Field" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD99"}, which at least
has one sensible application (two of them on the same location so they will
activate alternatingly), but no other even remotely intelligent use.
(And BTW, you'll totally disable the @{"Distortion" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD99"} when playing your own pattern
enhancers; read the card again)

Atmospheric Ionization is a legit obstacle to the standard "Mega Team"
approach, but then, it only affects one location again.

So, both cards a Pattern Enhancer does counter will not see much play. As
the Enhancer has no other function, you can figure out for yourself, how
often you will get this to a sensible use.

To quote Lore: Put a @{"Kev. Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} in your deck instead...


Favorite combo(s):

- No, not in combo mood today.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #136@{ub}

Hi, folks,

still hungry ? Grumble... Guess I have no alternatives than present you
another helping of your favorite posting series:


    @{b}NEURAL SERVO DEVICE@{ub}

    Event, uncommon.

Plays on any non-aligned ship. Unless 2 SECURITY aboard, use ship and crew
for one turn as your own. Discard event.

@{i}"Device which can be used to control a crew by activating pain causing im-
plants."@{ui}


Well, at least this one can be used on cards your opponent sometimes actually
uses. Many STCCG'ers play at least one @{"Husnock" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD41"} (though it's slow),
especially if not using a Fed crew (only Holodeck for Klingons or Rommies).

Also, we might see one or the other Combat Vessel (8/8/6 for 2 staff) or
@{"Mercenary Ship" link COTD137} (7/7/7 and a really crappy ability for 2 staff.)

The results are quite nice: You take that thing as if it were yours. What to
do with it now ?

5) Move it somewhere your opponent does not want to have it. Two turns gained,
   but nothing else.

4) Have the crew run into some nasty Dilemmas they can't overcome.

3) Attack one of your opponent's ships. Probably damaging at least one of them
   if not both...

2) Move it somewhere sensible (location with opponent's ships) and start an
   auto-destruct sequence. One killed, perhaps some more damaged.

1) Move it just where your opponent wanted to go and solve the mission there.
   Points + possible Artifact(s) + still the chance to do (2) after it !
   And the probability of your opponent having 2 SECURITY isn't too high, too,
   as no Dilemma absolutely needs more than one of them (Yes, Chalnoth can
   be beaten by 3 SECURITY, but also by any 41+ Strength.) So even mega-team
   players will probably start moving with one Security.

Weakness: Still too few non-aligned ships. Otherwise it would have been a
          game-breaker.


Favorite combo(s):

- Neural Servo Device + any mission of opponent + Auto-Destruct Sequence.

Hi, folks,

what was that I mentioned yesterday ? Non-aligned ships ? Like a


    @{b}MERCENARY SHIP@{ub}

    Ship, Non-aligned, common.

    Range 7
    Weapons 7
    Shields 7

    Long-Range Scan Shielding

    Requires 0 Command (*) and 2 Staff (+)

@{i}"Little-known ship. Difficult to track due to a unique hull design that
renders it invisible to long-range scans. Baran captained one in 2370."@{ui}


Not bad, not bad at all... (trivia buff question: Where's this quote from ?)

Two crew, no gold stars necessary, lotsa sevens and everybody can use it.
Although, with a little Brainwashing (@{"Neural Servo Device" link COTD136}) you can take this
"everybody" more literally than the player of this ship will like.

Of course, there's the Combat Vessel you have to compare this ship to. You
get one less range and weapons, but one more shields. The 1 Weapons would not
be that critical, but the range difference between 7 and 8 just sux, as all
those (really common) 5/3 and 4/4 span combinations will now take two moves
instead of one.

One more shields on the other hand is quite desirable against any battle deck
and against a @{"Crystal Entity" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD52"}. It'll make up for the range loss in a slow,
defensive deck, but not in a fast deck.

And the special ability of long-range-scan shielding ? I yet have to see a
player using a long-range scan so count that as the generic special ability
"Suck *ss."

Hi, folks,

sorry for the delay, but this issue is something special, a fact that delayed
it a little bit. Nope, it's not the first AU card...

It is just the first issue I am doing from my comfortable commander's seat
right in my well-heated home at a well-configured PC (mine) having a well-
cooled beer next to me... (you get the picture). So it might not have been
worth the wait for you, but it surely was for me :-)

BTW: Concerning AU, I'm finishing off my current list which still has 5 cards
on it, so #143 will be the first AU issue. All raters are called to do
ratings on all AU uncommons and rares they can get a hold of and send them to
me (the ratings, not the cards) as I do not know which cards I will be able
to get in my first purchase.

For today, it's:


    @{b}TETRYON FIELD@{ub}

    Event, common.

Plays crosswise on any spaceline location. All ships must stop here before
proceeding on next turn, unless Navigation aboard.

@{i}"Intense masses of subspace particles, unstable in normal space, which require
ships to route through safe corridors."@{ui}


Whoops, first question: Did anyone of you ever catch a player using this card?
A player possessing more than 60 cards?

Really:
A card that can be neutralized by no less than 20 different personnel cards ?
And then, it only stops a ship for one turn ? Well, less than stop, as it
only prevents movement and still allows mission attempts and battles ?
And in more than 30% of all cases has no effect at all, as the ship's range
would be exhausted anyway ?

Seriously, Decipher might have had a nice idea by making a Dilemma card that
is to be seeded in later play instead of in the seed phase, but they had
much better ideas along the same line; you need only think @{"Q-Net" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD86"} or
@{"Subspace Warp Rift" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD83"} (a much better card with the same purpose...)

And if I ever again encounter a card that is so bad that any COTD reader can
easily name 5 better cards for the same purpose, I promise you that I will
not finish the re-

Hi, folks,

it's red, it's uncommon, it's useless:


    @{b}K'VADA@{ub}

    Personnel, Klingon, uncommon.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 5
    Strength 7

    OFFICER, Leadership, Navigation, Command Star (*).

@{i}"Captain K'Vada transported @{"Captain Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/CODT1"} and
@{"Lt. Commander Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"} on an undercover mission to Romulus."@{ui}


Okay, as a 35 cents common with a flavor text of "Representative of ridge-
headed plot devices used by the creators upon noticing they didn't show
a Klingon in the last three episodes", this would have been an OK card. But
it would never have been a W's COTD, as I would have found nothing to bitch
about :-)

But like this, his only strong side is attributes and most players know, it's
not that hard to get by attribute requirements with any decent away team or
crew. (Unless the requirement is @{"Q's" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD32"} 62 INTEGRITY, that is )
His Skills ? Nothing to write home about. An OFFICER with Leadership is like
a Mathematician who knows higher Algebra, somehow quite redundant...
Then Navigation, not bad, but there are so many Klingons with this skill.
Take @{"Kurn" link COTD114} (Honor, Diplomacy, Computer Skill and better stats!) if you have
him.
If not, try a Nu'Daq who again has better stats and Archaeology and
Exobiology.
Still too expensive ? Well, use a Klag, he's common and universal. A little
less Integrity and no Leadership, but more in line with his rarity. Almost
as good as our K'Vada and much more available. BTW, once more an example how
a card gets somewhat augmented and placed in a rarity slot one place less
common. Decipher strategy. Yawn.

4 days to AU. Good.

Hi, folks,

at three days remaining to AU, let's get quick finishing OUR universe:


    @{b}SHELBY@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 7
    Strength 4

    OFFICER, Leadership, Exobiology, Command Star (*)

@{i}"Lt. Commander Shelby is an ambitious Starfleet officer. Assigned to the
@{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} as a specialist on the Borg."@{ui}


A card that really does not fit with itself. Although the skills fit the
episode very well, her two abilities (crappy for a Fed rare) do not
harmonize game-wise. Being an OFFICER with Leadership once again totally
nullifies the value of the classification, so they could have as well
made her a VIP.

The rest, Leadership and Exobiology are two skills which are both on the
better end of the scale but not at the very top. The trouble: They don't
fit together. Six Fed missions do require Leadership and four need
Exobiology. Unfortunately none of them requires both. And have you ever
seen a regular (basic rules) game where one player has 10 missions ?
Recommendations: Use @{"Roga Danar" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD18"} and @{"Evek" link COTD115} for Leadership or Richard Galen
for Exobiology. Their complementary skills just fit better.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #141@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here it is: Wesley's first AU card of the day (and this time "Wesley's" gets
a rather double-edged taste as this thing originally was my idea [back in
summer] and they USED IT!!! ) But I'll keep the review as objective as
possible.


    @{b}SECURITY SACRIFICE@{ub}

    Interrupt, common AU.

One SECURITY personnel present may sacrifice (substitute) for another per-
sonnel who has been randomly selected to die.

@{i}"Charged with ship and mission safety, security personnel are willing to
voluntarily expose themselves to hazards or threats, as Tasha Yar did on
many occasions."@{ui}


So, finally a use for those redshirt guys (tho we should call them yellow-
shirts in this game). SECURITY, until now was a useful skill, but only for
avoiding Dilemmas. And this is of course the catch. As you don't really need
the SECURITY guy once you're past the Dilemmas, it's a great way to save a
key crewmember for the mission you were just doing. But it would not be
a Wesley's card, were it not for a great abusive combo. Mind you, it says
"selected to die", not "died":

Play a @{"Genetronic Replicator" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"}. This saves your crew if you have two MEDICAL.
Unless one of your MEDICALs is affected, that is. And that's where the
Security sacrifice comes into play. Replace the dying MEDICAL by the
SECURITY (use @{"Roga Danar" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD18"} for Shock value), then show off with the replicator
and the two doctors and get your SECURITY back for another use. Repeat with
a new Sec. Sac. whenever necessary. (Or just @{"Palor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD25"} your Sacrifice back out
of the Discard Pile :-) ). Especially valuable if there is a "half of crew
dies" condition or something like that.


Now a quick bonus: Wesley's Original (which was a little bit stronger)

    @{b}SELF-SACRIFICE@{ub}

    Interrupt, common, No longer a Dream card.

Discard SECURITY or a crewmember with INTEGRITY > 6 from crew or away team
to resurrect a just killed personnel card.

"Highly integer crewmembers sometimes lay down their own life for the better
of their crewmates or the sake of the current mission. Security personnel
sometimes do the same unvoluntarily."

Picture: Wesley (The real one, not Wil Wheaton), lying sprawled on the floor,
with some rather unhealthy-looking dark red patterns on his face.


Favorite combo(s):

- @{"Genetronic Replicator" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"} + Security Sacrifice + MEDICAL + SECURITY.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #142@{ub}

Hi, folks,

before I entirely switch to AU, I'm gonna work up on two last cards from
the original set (not because I like them, but because I have to collect
the ratings on AU before going on)


    @{b}DEVINONI RAL@{ub}

    Personnel, Non-aligned, uncommon.

    Integrity 3
    Cunning 9
    Strength 3

    V.I.P., Empathy, Diplomacy, Treachery

@{i}"1/4 Betazoid, 3/4 Human. Skilled negotiator. Abused his empathic powers
to gain advantage. Had a dangerous liaison with @{"Counselor Deanna Troi" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD39"}."@{ui}


Of course, he's one of the guys that had a LOT to gain from AU. With his
skill list, he will be an indispensable life-saver in a lot of Klingon
decks, as there are now some Dilemmas that *really* hurt if you don't
have empaths and Klingons do not have any empathy among their own ranks.
(Rommies now at least have the @{"Major Rakal" link COTD147} card, which is close to being
the most interesting personnel card I've ever seen).

Also, a Fed deck that does not rely on high Integrity might make good use
of this card as he's basically a @{"Deanna Troi" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD39"} with an extra Treachery but
a little lower on attribute scores. Just make sure there's no Firestorm
waiting around the corner...

The combination of Empathy and Diplomacy is also useful for at least one
mission, and the Treachery might prove really helpful in a Fed deck
playing an opponent using a @{"Compromised Mission" link COTD162} (lots of fun missions in
AU anyway) So what was until last week a card I would really have
overlooked and not even considered for deck-building suddenly became a
viable utility card with a few twists, which sheds a very good light on
the way AU interacts with the basic game. Great job, Decipher!


Favorite combo(s):

- Devinoni + opponent's @{"compromised mission" link COTD162}: Nothing better than a good
  surprise!

OK, I might reconsider that. There's one card that will not draw any
dissent about ratings, so look out for another (really improperly named)

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #143@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's the extra card...


    @{b}MOT'S ADVICE@{ub}

    Event, uncommon, AU.

Play on any one personnel. While in play, that personnel gains the skill
of Barbering.

@{i}"@{"Mr. Mot" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD24"} offered sage advice to his customers on a variety of subjects,
but there was only one thing you could really learn from him."@{ui}


Yes, it's cool and I begin to see a pattern here...
They insert a Mot card into every set, which currently has no effect at
all, but everybody starts bitching about it. And then, with the last set
at the end of 1997, they release a card that is a *G*A*M*E*B*R*E*A*K*E*R*
and requires let's say 4 Barbering...
Of course by then, everybody will have thrown all their Mots away and the
lucky few who still have one can win every tourney...

But the review for now is:
You get an event card. So you lose a turn on card play. The effect of the
event is, that a personnel card gains a skill. A skill that is required
for exactly 0 situations in the entire STCCG game. So you might also
change the text of the card to "Play on table. Nothing happens."

This one should have been the ultra-rare instead of the Future
Enterprise. The players would have been happy as they did not lose the
use of a good card and the collectors would have had something to chase
for...


Favorite combo(s):

- Just to get your opponent gasping (or laughing so hard she can't
  concentrate on the game anymore): Play Mot's Advice on... Mot! If the
  remaining 58 cards of your deck are good enough this will leave your
  opponent so startled you're probably going to win...

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #144@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's the last COTD from the basic set:


    @{b}HONOR CHALLENGE@{ub}

    Interrupt, rare.

Plays just after an Away Team battle is initiated. Each Klingon with
Honor immediately kills one opponent with Treachery. Battle continues.

@{i}"The call to glory inspires the Klingon warrior to maximum fierceness and
honor, as symbolized by the Bat'telth champoinship trophy."@{ui}


One of the few battle-affecting cards from the base game, but one with a
good effect, especially if speed is a concern. Try it in any flavor of
Klingon Armada deck, where it works just great against Romulans and even
has some effect against the other affiliations (lots of the non-aligneds
have Treachery, too.) Its most important net effect is that you get to
tip the scales towards your side. If you have four honorable Klingons,
you can probably take on a Romulan away team of six or seven and still
expect to win the battle.

But its use goes a little farther and this is now also a viable
Federation strategy (though as a Fed you will first need to somehow get a
@{"Wartime Conditions" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/CODT217"} out): Take a single expendable Klingon (perhaps the
key guy for the mission you just completed) and send him in alone to do
battle. He will of course lose, but not without taking an opponent's key
crewmember with him. Try this on an opponent who relies on @{"Devinoni Ral" link COTD142}
for Empathy or who tries a Mickey D. approach to a few quick points. Also
works great on these really annoying @{"Selas" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD23"} and @{"Taibaks" link COTD85} your Rommie friend
uses to complete his mission(s).

And for a maximum surprise effect (this is a late-game combo), play the
Klingon (and @{"Worf" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD35"}, K'Eleyhr and Alexander are equally good choices for
it) from your hand using a @{"Devidian door" link COTD146} once you're really ahead on
points and just need to stop your opponent from catching up before you
draw your last card. Fire the Klingon, stop the away team, eliminate a
key personnel and (hopefully) win the game! Just make sure you get him
there one turn before your opponent beams down, otherwise you'll not be
able to initiate battle. Also a good ploy for Feds: Deploy an Alexander
at some planet where your opponent is likely to attempt a mission. Wait
for beamdown, she'll hopefully attack you, you eliminate a key player and
have a great excuse to play a @{"Wartime Conditions" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD217"}. This will teach warlike
opponents to stay peaceful...


Favorite combo(s):

- As just mentioned.

Hi, folks,

my mentor, @{"the Traveler" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD4"}, just told me there's a card really worth
reviewing.
I fully agree, BTW...


    @{b}LAKANTA@{ub}

    Personnel, Non-aligned, uncommon, AU.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 12
    Strength 3

    CIVILIAN, Ship he is on can leave one end of spaceline and enter other
    end. @{"Wesley Crusher" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"} attributes +4, if present. Staff Star (+), AU Icon.

@{i}"Male of American Indian descent. Actually @{"the Traveler" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD4"} in disguise.
@{"Wesley Crusher" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"} left Starfleet Academy to study transcendence of thought
with him."@{ui}


A few of my raters commented "Rather use a Where no one has gone before
instead." WHY ? He is a living Where no One has gone before + a Cunning
of 12 + he can not be Uxbridged + you get an AU icon for your Future
Enterprise + you get a staff star for whatever ship you need one for +
you get a 10/13/9 @{"Wesley" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"}. Wait - 10/13/9 ? That all ? Why not improve on
this with a Humuhumunukunukuapua'a ? 10/17/13 sounds even better! (I just
like this combo, having these two solve a Sensitive Search all by
themselves!)

Wait, let's slow down a little.
A Non-aligned CIVILIAN with an AU icon. Good for any deck that makes use
of the incredibly fast AU ships. And just here the WNOHGB effect kicks in
even more nicely! Just have him on a range 13 ship (or 11 or 10, for this
purpose) and go pretty everywhere within 1 or 2 turns! Also, he helps
flying these ships and reduces your away team size (important for
@{"The Higher... the Fewer" link COTD155}) when you need to rely on attributes.
Another great team: @{"Wesley" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"} + Lakanta + Vekor + @{"Alternate Tasha" link COTD165} +
@{"Major Rakal" link COTD147} (Fed Variant): All these five are good by themselves, but add a
Future Enterprise and a @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD13"} and start getting really nasty:

A 39/30/27 ship, with WNOHGB, OFFICER, ENGINEER, SECURITY, CIVILIAN,
MEDICAL, VIP, SCIENCE, Computer Skill, Navigation (x2), Geology, Youth,
Astrophysics, Honor, Leadership, Diplomacy, Empathy, INTEGRITY 36,
CUNNING 45, STRENGTH 40.

For only seven cards you get THE unstoppable ship onto the spaceline! You
should rather select your missions for this one.


Favorite combo(s):

- I like them both, but the INFINITE POWER ENTERPRISE is just too good to
  pass.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #146@{ub}

Hi, folks,

today I'm making an attempt at reviewing AU's most powerful card (IMHO)
and I am pretty sure I did not get all uses of:

    @{b}DEVIDIAN DOOR@{ub}

    Doorway, rare AU.

Allows you to play a card "from the future". Whether or not you currently
have a Devidian Door in your hand, at any time say "Devidian Door" and
play (to anywhere) one personnel or Equipment card from your hand.
However, any time during your next turn, you must show opponent a
Devidian Door from your hand and place it out-of-play or you lose the
game.

Okay, where do I start this one ?
Probably with the final rating first: This one is a gamebreaker. Will go
right next to the Black Lotus of Magic in terms of what is a too-fast
card.

Uses for this one abound:

- Most basic: If your crew urgently needs an extra skill but is far away
from any outpost, use it as a mini-outpost to avoid the time cost of
transporting your crewmember to the place she is needed at.

- With redshirts: Select a mission doable by a lone personnel (Evaluate
Terraforming, Investigate Time Continuum...) Redshirt the Dilemmas, then
get in your big guy and solve the mission without even getting stopped as
the Devidian Door plays at interrupt speed.

- Nasty surprise: When your opponent thinks it safe to attack your team,
surprise her with a Echo Papa Drone, Phaser or Data from your hand to
tilt the scales your way.

- Getting back into play: You lost one too many crew for passing that *&%
Q-Net or flying your big ship ? Don't worry, be doory.

- In the nick of time: Can't get your Red Alert? Well, go cruisin' with
a minimal crew, then play the needed guy when you know what Dilemmas you
have to face. Better have a Betazoid Gift Box under that mission to get
that alert then...

- Even worse: Create whole away teams in an interrupt with an
Ophidian cane and a Devidian Door.

- Kill Dilemmas: Hold a Security and a Security Sacrifice. Nullify any
Dilemma that just struck you. Security are always great candidates for
dooring, anyway (you don't need them everywhere but if you do it gets
urgent)

- Ouch: Just uncovered your Kurlan Naiskos at the far end of the
spaceline ? An lack a CIVILIAN ? No problem - Devidian Door and start
blasting away! (at triple speed, too!)

- Fear some discard effect ? Use Devidian Door + Sam Clemens' pocketwatch
and drop it right away.

- Pokerface: Use it to solve the mission that gives you the
Betazoid gift box and get it from your draw deck with the Box. You
don't need it in your hand for this variant.

- Last stand: Your opponent gonna win next turn ? Devidian door anything
that stops him from doing so, even if you don't have the card. Play a
Kivas Fajo next turn and hope for the 20-50% chance you'll draw it...

- The degenerate deck: 4 Kivas Fajo, 4 Devidian Doors, 2 Travelers,
Red Alert, 14 decent Fed personnel, Enterprise-D, Enterprise-C, Q2,
Kevin Uxbridge, Goddess of Empathy.
Seed cards: Naiskos, Ophidian Cane, Horga'hn, Betazoid Gift Box,
Data's Head, 6 Fed planet missions, AU door, 17 Dilemmas, Fed outpost.
Makes Warp 9 seem like snail's crawl!

Caveat: You should only use it if you don't have it in hand, if you
- either absolutely know you're gonna draw it
- or you are going to lose anyway so it's better to take the chance...

Favorite combo(s):

- Any one that makes good use of this card

Hi, folks,

if you wondered where... Well, I recently played a game of STCCG with
Santa and he grinningly pulled a Seize Wesley card and so I got stuck
near the North Pole...
At least my brain didn't totally freeze, so I can review...

    @{b}MAJOR RAKAL@{ub}

    Personnel     Federation/Romulan, rare AU.

    Integrity 8/4
    Cunning 7/8
    Strength 4

    VIP, Empathy, Diplomacy (Fed only), Tal Shiar (Rom only), Treachery (Rom
    only), Command Star, AU icon.

@{i}"Physically altered, Deanna Troi was coerced to completely assume the
identity of a Tal Shiar major in the 2369 M'ret defection plot."@{ui}

Great concept (tho they weren't the first with that idea but mine worked
somewhat differently) and too bad they missed out on a bunch of other
opportunities in the basic set (K'Eleyhr, the Duras conspiracy, maybe
even Worf).

What do you get for this card? A Deanna Troi. A full Deanna for all
those who couldn't afford one till now. Just that she's a VIP instead of
an Officer.

More? Yep. The ability to sneak into an opponent's Rommie mission with a
Fed deck. Just load up with non-aligned crew!

Still more? Yep. The confidence to gain 40 really easy points out of a
Rommie mission. Mind you, you can really redshirt anything that gets in
your way. Just keep Rakal up there until the last possible second...

Also, one of the better Empathy cards. Especially for our green friends
who totally lacked that skill until now. And this one is badly necessary
with the new Dilemmas and Events...

Even more? Sure. Finally a picture where Marina Sirtis looks good.
Net result: A Deanna Troi actually worth using. And a perfect upgrade of
the original one. Even for a pure Fed deck...

Favorite combo(s):

- Rakal + some non-aligned personnel + Quash Conspiracy - in a Fed deck:
  SURPRISE!

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #148@{ub}

Hi, folks,

if there's one thing AU did for us, it's that they finally introduced
a few really INTERESTING missions, like


    @{b}WARPED SPACE@{ub}

    Mission, Klingon, Space, rare AU.

    SCIENCE x 2 + Navigation + Astrophysics

    Span 5 (for the player seeding it) or 1 (for the opponent)

    45 points

@{i}"Amargosa Diaspora: Investigate Gravity wells in globular cluster."@{ui}


@{"Kurak" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD76"} + @{"Vekor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD37"} = 45 ? Not the worst STCCG equation I've heard in the
last few weeks. And that's the catch of this card. It is GREAT for
your speed - two people and you almost got half a win. The drawback?

It's also GREAT for your opponent's speed, who, probably not playing
Klingon will get around this obstacle in Space quite fast...

So, who has more to gain ?

You, the Klingon player are at a desperate disadvantage when it gets
to drafting a crew with decent skills. You need quite a lot of people
to complete a full away team (though you can add non-aligned crew like
@{"Roga Danar" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD18"} and @{"Vekor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD37"} to supply much-needed classifications). Perhaps
try this:

Seed Warped space as close to the end of the spaceline as possible (to
minimize your opponent's advantage). Place your outpost there. Try to
get a @{"Kurak" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD76"} (or a Torin), a @{"Vekor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD37"}, a @{"Roga Danar" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD18"} and another MEDICAL.
Pretty well prepared for any Dilemma, get the 45 points - and the
@{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169} with a @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD13"} and three more key personnel
(@{"Gov. Worf" link COTD151}, Berlingoff & K'mtar). Add an OFFICER and start blasting
everything out of space along with beaming about a little bit and sol-
ving one or the other mission...

Your opponent, the Fed rich kid, with all his Bridge crew, has only
one solution: Being faster than you. He has all those people, but
he'll have to make some distance with limited ship resources (he'll
need lotsa events and interrupts to get his crew fast enough and will
also need lotsa Seed Cards.) But he'll need two missions to catch up
in points as he won't be able to do a 45'er at his outpost that
easily. So he'll need to get to another doable mission soon, and this
is where your cute Warped Space starts hurting YOU! This one just
isn't there for him and he'll be that one location faster...

In the end it will all be a race: Can you blast him out of space or
can he collect the 100 before you do so ?

Net result: a beautiful card for both players as it really speeds up
a game that sometimes tends to drag a little. Great work!


Favorite combo(s):

- Warped space + @{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169}: A Klingon speed deck made possible.

- Same + @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD13"}: A FAST and irresistible Klingon blast deck!

Hi, folks,

here's a Dilemma to use against the rich kids (that's those with
the Future Enterprise that still evades me):


    @{b}RASCALS@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space, uncommon AU.

All unique crew members (maximum of 4, random selection) are kids.
STRENGTH = 2 and Youth replaces first-listed skill. Cure with 2
MEDICAL and Biology.

@{i}"Passing through a molecular reversion field in a shuttle, Guinan,
@{"Ro Laren" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD92"}, Keiko O'Brien and @{"Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} reverted to children's
bodies but retained adult knowledge."@{ui}


Well, this card somewhat missed its goal. It was intended as a fix
against the players with all the great Bridge crew. Now just look
at what happens instead:

Player 1 has a starter and 6 boosters, thus 39 uncommons and rares.
Assuming he plays Fed, he'll probably have around 6 unique personnel
and he's gonna use them all in order to stand a chance. So he'll
have four or less in an average away team and his best guys are all
affected :-(

Player 2 is a rich one with a complete set of everything. In her 18
personnel cards she has 17 uniques (just @{"Vekor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD37"} cause she's great).
She'll lose the use of one or two of her top five crew, but not four.

Net result: This card hurts the player with few options more than the
really rich one.

Also, note the great effect of this card on @{"Wes" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"}: Youth gets replaced
by Youth!

Still, Rascals might offer great combo opportunities when used with
Dilemmas that require Strength. El-Adrel creatures, Chalnoths, Rebel
Encounters and Malfunctioning doors would be good choices, but they're
all planets. Just where are the Space Dilemmas with Strength require-
ments?

Best comparison: @{"Tsiolkovsky infection" link COTD128}. Similar effect, though more
personnel affected and no Strength loss. Also, similar cure (though
Rascals seems a bit easier if you can get @{"Bev Crusher" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD22"} to remain
unaffected). Almost equal game value. Average. Next.

Hi, folks,

again a jubilee number and I'm almost out of ideas for what to do
as a soemwhat special issue, so I'll take up on an idea that
recently floated around the 'net and make it into a card, namely
a way to link card games:


    @{b}FANTASY WORLD@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet, rare AU, Dream Card.

You and your opponent each pick up a MAGIC: THE GATHERING deck
and play a game, starting at 30 life. Winner of that game scores
his remaining life as points. If you do not know how to play
MAGIC, opponent gains 3 points. Discard Dilemma.

@{i}"@{"Q" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD30"} and several others lured the @{"Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} crew to worlds of
magical fantasy, having them play games for the entertainment
of the bored immortal."@{ui}


But this would be too cheap, just starting a subgame. So where's
the linking element ? Here:


    @{b}WORLD RIFT@{ub}

    Artifact, uncommon MAGIC (but distributed with STCCG/AU!), Dream Card.

    Casting Cost 0.

X, Tap: Put any Personnel you have in a running ST:CCG game
directly into play. Use it as a creature with Toughness =
INTEGRITY and Power = STRENGTH. X is the higher of the two
numbers. If the Personnel is killed, remove it from the ST:CCG
game, otherwise return it at end of subgame.

It has First Strike ability if CUNNING is 6 or higher.

@{i}"There's more where THAT came from"@{ui}



Cool ? Sure.

Get some strong but expendable guys into your STCCG crew, then
uncover the Fantasy World and produce a fast green deck with
several World Rifts. Summon the big hitters as fast as you can.

Try Taurik (8/7), Chris Hobson (6/6), Korris (8/8), L'Kor (7/7),
Tokath (6/6) or Movar (7/5) all of which don't have the greatest
STCCG skills but are very cost-effective strikers for the subgame
and you can even afford to get them terrored...

Fast 30 points, go to next location, lather, rinse, repeat.

I'd appreciate comments or (if you actually try them out) your
play experiences...

You can also try other card games:

@{b}MORIARTY'S SCHEMES@{ub}: Play INWO, winner gains 25 pts.
@{i}"Professor Moriarty plotted against the @{"Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} crew when he
found out he was trapped on the holodeck."@{ui}

and

@{b}TIME TRAVELERS@{ub}: INWO Group card, Pwr 1, Res 1, SCIENCE, SPACE, WEIRD.
Can use his action to bring one STCCG personnel from the main
game to your hand, who is treated as a Straight Government
Science Personality with Pwr = STR and Res = INT and one
outgoing control arrow at any position you choose.

Galactic Empires (use those ships!)

SW:CCG (obvious choice, isn't it ?)

..

[anyone care to think up the link card pairs ?]

He's gotten a little weaker with age, but he's

grand bonus as we already had @{"Gowron" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD5"} to care for the oh-so-useful

For even faster fun, place Worf, Rasmussen and the @{"Naiskos" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD13"} in a @{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169}
and you need only two specific personnel one of which is universal!)

Missions for this character? Pegasus Search, Investigate Disturbance,
Cloaked Mission, Krios Suppression.

A card Klingon decks really cannot afford to be without. Will probably
be one of the most expensive AU cards (after the Future E.)

@Node COTD152 "STCCG.guide/ST:CCG Card of the Day/Rishon Uxbridge"

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #152@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's a card of which some people think it's great, others think it's
crap:


    @{b}RISHON UXBRIDGE@{ub}

    Event, common AU.

Plays atop any one event card in play. Protects the underlying event from
@{"Kevin Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}. However, @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} may remove (discard) Rishon. (not
cumulative). AU Icon.

@{i}"In his grief, the Douwd @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} re-created his dead wife, Rishon.
As if she were real, he responded to her tendency to keep him calm at
tense moments."@{ui}


Let's analyze who is right:

1) The "crap" argument: Hey, why should I play this card instead of just
another copy of the base event which would even help me get it out faster?
This argument is actually valid and in many cases will hold well.
However, there are a few exceptions, and that gets me to the other side:

2) The "not-so-crappy" arguments: First, there are a few vital cards
(@{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}) for which the above-mentioned argument does not hold, as you can't
use two of them in a deck when playing by tournament rules.

Second, you might want to use a Rishon to protect a key event on the
spaceline before nuking all others with a @{"Kev Ux: Convergence" link COTD191}.

Third, this also is a psychological card. Play @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} - get it
@{"Uxbridged" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}, play another @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} - opponent will likely @{"Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} it
again. However she might think twice before using up two @{"Kevins" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} on the
same one @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} card.

3) The "forget that - it's still crappy" arguments: Playing a Rishon
costs you a turn and turns are limited resources. This might just prove
too much work just for a single event, especially as most of them can do
their work quite quickly (@{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} is futile as soon as you have played
all your cards from your hand - you'll need to hoard cards to really use
it again, so why should I protect it instead of just using it ?)

And another one: Mind that @{"Kevin" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} is an INTERRUPT! When your opponent
tries to play a Rishon, interrupt that play and nuke the underlying event
before Rishon hits the table! Result: Event discarded, Rishon will have
to find another target (and will be in for a rules hassle if there are no
more events to choose from...)

Also, why don't you just replace the Rishon with a Q2 giving you the
additional advantage of nuking that @{"Kevin" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} instead of just avoiding him.

Net result: The crap side wins :-(


Favorite combo(s):

- @{"Anti-Time-Anomaly" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD21"} + Rishon (+ Temporal Rift): Your opponent might hold
  one @{"Kevin" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}, but will she have TWO ?

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #153@{ub}

Hi, folks,

popular demand puts so much pressure on me to do a certain Fed
ship that I'll do the next best thing to keep you guys satisfied
until I get my copy of the real thing...

    @{b}U.S.S. ENTERPRISE-C@{ub}

    Ship, Federation, rare AU.

    Range 8
    Weapons 7
    Shields 8

    Requires 1 Command (*), 1 Staff (+), 1 AU icon.

    Enters play damaged at any location. Tractor Beam. AU icon.

@{i}"Predecessor of @{"U.S.S. Enterprise-D" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"}. Famous for heroic action in
Battle of Narendra III, where it also entered a temporal rift.
Commanded by @{"Rachel Garrett" link COTD160}."@{ui}


Okay, what do we have here ? Almost a U.S.S. Galaxy with one less
Range, but instead special ability that is not to be neglected.
Enters play at any location, damaged. Well, many people think
of this as just a way to recover a stranded crew. Not too bad,
though this will not happen to you too often. Here's a better
idea:

You know the Transwarp Conduit ? Here you get a Transwarp conduit
that is a little weaker (just adds 5 range instead of the full
amount), but stays around forever and can attack if commanded
by some non-aligned leader.

And there's another thing to it: It is affected by @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}, so it
can be played at no card cost, but it cannot be countered by @{"Amanda Rogers" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD31"}.
(Add an @{"Exocomp" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD56"} to make this card even more valuable!)

So you need that extra range ? You know what card to play.
Need something to remove that @{"Garbage Scow" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD84"} quickly without
killing the points ? Use the Enterprise-C and then use a
Near-Warp Transport to get your crew back if you need it this turn.

So the bottom line again is SPEED. Lotsa speed! And if you need
one less turn than your opponent to gain those 100 points you
know who wins the game...

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #154@{ub}

Hi, folks,

already COTD time again ? Damn are 24 hours just short :-)
How about an...


    @{b}OPHIDIAN CANE@{ub}

    Artifact, rare AU.

Place in hand until played as an Interrupt card to allow 3 through
Devidian Door OR double Devidian Foragers (to four personnel) OR double
Empathic Touch. (AU icon)

@{i}"Disguised serpentine alien device used by the Devidians. When irradiated
with the correct energy, the head comes alive and allows Devidians to
control their time travel."@{ui}


So this is the first card that cannot be used on its own at all.
Now, its three uses:

1) Triple a @{"Devidian door" link COTD146}. I think I've already detailed the advantages
   of this play in the @{"Devidian Door" link CODT146} article. If you want to use the door
   effectively, this card is close to being a must.

2) Double Devidian Foragers. Hmmm, nice card that one if you need a lot
   of attribute points (did anyone say Brute Force ?) or if your opponent
   just tries to @{"Res-Q" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD28"} somebody out of his discard (snatch him away and
   just forget the bonus you won't be able to use effectively on your
   opponent's turn). Double that and you'll get a cute li'l 40/43/45 @{"Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"}
   you might find numerous uses for. Too bad it's just until end of turn
   and it does not add skills. Not really worth that much as you're not
   that often short on attributes. However the combo makes for a nice "oops"
   if you are about to be struck by some nasty Dilemma. Just remember you
   have to use it BEFORE counting values...

3) Double Empathic touch. Hmmm, we will probably have to wait some time
   before we can evaluate this combo. If it is as good as the @{"Eyes in the Dark" link COTD156}
   (a card that really got me confused :-( ) we might see an alternative
   use for the cane someday.

Now for (2) and (3) you might say "Why go through all the pain - I'll
just double up the relevant interrupt" and you're not that wrong about
this. However, the interrupt will occupy a place in your draw deck which
is often not a desirable thing(TM) especially if you're playing a speed
deck. Also I consider the latter two only an emergency alternative. The
real use is #1.


Favorite combo(s):

- Ophidian Cane + @{"Devidian Door" link COTD146} - beats the other two possibilities by
  lengths

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #155@{ub}

Hi, folks,

so some people seem to be REALLY addicted if I start getting "What's up"
mails after three days. Let's hope the sender hasn't already gone mad
for lack of COTD's.

And there was another guy who made a short and rather impolite request
for more Romulan cards. I won't call names here, and his mail has already
fallen prey to the big rm, but people like him should remember that
nobody pays me for this. Next person to bug me this way will be
forcefully brought to review 155 SPELLFIRE cards.

So, here's today's ish:


    @{b}THE HIGHER... THE FEWER@{ub}

    Dilemma, either, uncommon AU.

Subtract X from your total score, where X = the number of personnel in
this crew or Away Team.

@{i}"The Parallax Poet's cosmic lesson for Alexander was, 'Every moment
requires a purpose. Every purpose requires a plan. The Higher... The
Fewer."@{ui}


At first glace, this does not look that great. Killing some 5 or 8 points
off your opponent's score is not that big a deal, but let's consider this
chart:

Points per Mission      # of Missions
60                      1
55                      1
50                      1
45                      3
40                      7
35                      23
30                      18
25                      3
20                      1
15                      1

Hmm. Most probable three-mission victories? 35-35-35 = 105. 30-35-35 =
100. 40-35-35 = 110. 40-35-30 = 105. 40-30-30 = 100. Add the occasional 5
points from some Dilemma and you get a score between 105 and 120 pts.
Decrease this by 3 x 8 (assuming you seed lots of these) or just by 2 x 8
(assuming you just used some of them) and you're below 100 requiring your
opponent to do a fourth mission thus gaining quite some time.

Even better: Don't just stack six of these and seed every mission with
it, but be satisfied with two you strategically place under the 35'ers.
Remember that 3 x 35 = 105 but 3 x 30 = 90 !

Convinced ? Good. Want to buy some at $10 apiece :-) ?


Favorite combo(s):

- The Higher... + any 35 point mission you do not intend to solve.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #156@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's another one to make up for the weekend and for the fact I might
be unable to do a card tomorrow (Diplomatic mission placed on me by
my ST Fan Club):


    @{b}EYES IN THE DARK@{ub}

    Interrupt, common AU.

Plays when facing a dilemma. If Empathy present, add the skills and
attribute numbers of one personnel (random selection) from any opponent's ship
(your choice). AU icon.

@{i}"@{"Deanna Troi" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD39"} saved the @{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} in 2367 by communicating through
nightmarish visions with a telepathic species on the other side of a
Tyken's rift."@{ui}


A potential lifesaver and a card that sounds a lot like it might have been
called "Empathic touch" some time in the design process :-). It involves
empathically reaching out to add somebody's skills to your own, so you
might now understand the #154 goof...

So what's the use ? When you hit any Dilemma you think you cannot overcome
you can just throw it on the table and hope for the best. Just remember
where the personnel with the required skills are! Also, these skills are not
killed when you still fail. Assume you lack the SECURITY for a
@{"Barclay's disease" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD29"} encountered on a planet. You play the Empathic touch, choose a ship
and curse loudly, having drawn @{"Bev Crusher" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD22"}. Your entire crew dies, but now...
.. your @{"Genetronic Replicator" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"} kicks in!!!

Yes, the Empathy is only required to first use the Eyes in the Dark and once
it resolves, the skills are added to the crew (not just to a single person).
Your crew is selected to die, you check for two MEDICAL and still have
it-so they all come back to live to attempt another Dilemma!

That was of course a more-than-rare incident, more common is the situation
where you just lack a few attribute points and success is nearly assured,
so especially this case will prove to be a good use of the card.

Just always memorize the crews of your opponent, especially if she plays
a swarm deck with lotsa ships out of which you can pretty comfortably
select the one that gives you the greatest chance at survival.

Nice to have, better than the @{"Transporter Armbands" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD95"} (old variant) as you
don't get stopped if it works.

- Eyes in the Dark and Good Luck :-)

cute things like @{"Nagilums" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD51"}, @{"Q-Nets" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD86"} and..... Shakas?

Place this one in front of a Shaka to make the latter a little hard to
pass unless the first one is passed, which in turn can be made a little
harder by using a Chalnoth and/or a @{"Ferengi attack" link COTD184} and the nasty person
on the other side of the table (the one who plays that much worse but
has more money to buy cards / incredible luck in the draw / just acci-
dentally found the one weakness in your deck / ...) will probably regret
ever having attempted this mission.

And though the list of possibilities to pass is quite long, it serves to
make the card equally hard or easy to all affiliations.

@{"Wesley" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"} and Exobiology are easy for Feds, Exobiology and Disruptors are
found for Klingons and our Rommie friends will have Disruptors and
Treachery, so everybody can find something (but something not too common)
to get past this Dilemma and that's what unfortunately makes it a little
weak on its own. The chance to cripple a team with this is actually
fairly low unless you can take some preparations with a Disruptor
overload, a well-placed Phaser Burns (or two or three...) or any of the
opponent's choice Dilemmas.

Just remember they'll probably have one of the requirements. But most
probably not two...


Favorite combo(s):

- @{"Ferengi Attack" link COTD184} + @{"Outpost Raid" link COTD183} + Zaldan + Shaka (in this order): Kills
  at least four of them (ensure a large team with the Ferengi, kill two
  of your choice with the @{"raid" link CODT183}, two more with the Zaldan then stop her
  with Shaka) and also eliminates 3-4 turns!

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #158@{ub}

Hi, folks,

now that a certain Romulan fan has (very politely) apologized I'll show
I do not hold a grudge for long and proceed with something really
Romulan:


    @{b}DECIUS@{ub}

    Ship, Romulan, rare AU.

    Range 10
    Weapons 9
    Shields 8

    Requires 1 Command (*), 1 Staff (+), 1 AU.

    Cloaking Device, Holodeck, Tractor Beam, AU Icon.

@{i}"Powerful ship created in Barash's illusion. Commanded by Tomalak.
Transported Admiral @{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} and @{"Deanna Troi" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD39"} to a Romulan peace conference."@{ui}


Okay, for the Rommie fans, I'll take their "future" ship first, you'll
probably see the Future Enterprise and the @{"Fek'lhr" link COTD176} later on this
channel:-)

Anyway, the basic principle behind these three ships is simple: You get
an awesome ship but you dearly pay for it in terms of crew requirements.
Or in this particular case, do you really?

You need three personnel, as with any regular D'Deridex. The only
difference here is that instead of the second staff you need an AU
personnel. And this is, for our Romulan friends, NOT A GOOD THING (TM).

Actually, there's only two sensible solutions (@{"Cmdr Tomalak" link COTD167} sux and he
does not even gain the Captain's log benefit, @{"Ajur and Boratus" link COTD175} have
limited use and Mickey D. is just plain weak at the moment): Berlingoff
Rasmussen and (even though you don't make full use of his powers)
@{"Lakanta" link COTD145}. The latter will actually help you a lot as 10 range is FAST and
with a WNOHGB built in this is even faster!

The 9 Weapons / 8 Shields are of course nothing new, we have seen this
combination in the Haakona, but there's one more thing which is not so
easily ignored: a Holodeck for Romulans! No more clumsy @{"Husnocks" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD41"} to use
your Holo personnel (Jera and Tomek, both quite good for commons!) but
a fast and versatile ship instead. And it's really quite hard to say
which of the future ships is the best. The @{"Fek'lhr" link COTD176} is faster, but she
needs 4 crew and the Future Enterprise is even stronger, but at 4 crew of
which 3 need to be AU and the fact that you probably don't have it in the
first place - I don't know.


Favorite combo(s):

- Decius + @{"Lakanta" link COTD145} + Tomalak + any Staff: 10/12/11 with built-in WNOHGB

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #159@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's a card that will sooner or later draw another review, just because
it has so many loose ends that will someday been tied up:


    @{b}RESCUE CAPTIVES@{ub}

    Interrupt, uncommon.

All your personnel currently held captive are returned to your
outpost(s), nullifying @{"Interrogation" link COTD170}, Brainwash and Torture, if any or
all are in progress.

@{i}"Away teams led by Security chiefs like Tasha Yar have at times been sent
to rescue captured personnel, as in this occasion at Mordan IV in 2364."@{ui}


Hmm. A card that is useless unless your opponent has made some captives.
Let's see how she could achieve this...

Events:
None. But one that makes use of a captive.

Interrupts:
Seize Wesley. Requires a certain Dilemma (@{"Ktarian game" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD91"}) to strike
successfully (assured, if encountered).
Romulan Ambush. Needs her playing Romulan, you using a ship with
shields<6 and her chasing you.
Thine own Self. Anti-Redshirting Interrupt.

Dilemmas:
@{"Cardassian trap" link COTD190}. Will hit quite often, unless you're Fed.

All other card types: Zip.

So four cards can currently make captives. And there's just one that
makes them anything else than just killed crew. Not a very-well fleshed
out concept. But, assuming your opponent is going to use it (which might
be a good idea if you're a notorious user of @{"genetronic Replicators" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"} or
@{"Res-Q's" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD28"}) you might as well counter it. You'll get them back all at once.
Good thing, mucho better thing if your opponent is doing something nasty
to them.

So this will probably someday be one of the best cards in the game,
unless they do not expand the captives concept any further in which case
it will stay what it currently is: way too limited. Though maybe a
sideboard card if you wnat to be prepared for a captives strategy.

BTW: Here's a rules suggestion concerning captives (Are you listening,
Decipher ?):

"When you first declare an away team attack you can state you attack to
capture instead of killing. If you win the battle, you make a captive
(random selection). As long as the battle continues, players who have
captives from the battle will have to guard each captive with one crew
from his/her own away team, who can no longer participate in the battle.
If captives are beamed to a ship, guarding is no longer necessary, but
you need an unstopped personnel to accompany the beaming attempt."


Favorite combo(s):

- None yet. Waiting for a card to make the captive strategy worthwhile.

Hi, folks,

just visited a few of the Dream card sites... Hmm...Great! Why don't we
just let the game die, so Decipher will no longer pursue their copyrights
and then make our own game ? We'd probably be a LOT faster putting out
expansions than them :-)
Nope. Just kidding. On to what you guys been waiting for all night:


    @{b}RACHEL GARRETT@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare AU.

    Integrity 9
    Cunning 7
    Strength 5

    OFFICER, Honor, ENGINEER, Leadership, Diplomacy, Astrophysics, Command
    Star (*), AU Icon.

@{i}"Captain of @{"U.S.S. Enterprise-C" link COTD153} when it entered a temporal rift during the
Battle of Narendra III in 2344. Ordered a return to the historic battle
from 2366."@{ui}


Okay, half a @{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} (OFFICER, Diplomacy, Leadership, Honor) plus half a
@{"Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"} (ENGINEER, Astrophysics) and all that a lot cheaper than the top
two cards on every price list. Nearly @{"Tsiolokvsky" link COTD128}-proof (one of her least
valuable skills will go), thus also laughs about @{"Rascals" link COTD149}. And female on
top of it. We finally got a really good lady who is not a doctor !

In Detail: besides her basic useless OFFICER classification she got a
skill list that reads like the 'who is who' in useful stuff. ENGINEERs
are always handy (one of the reasons @{"Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"} is so good), as there is no
limit to the number of ENGINEERs that can give you a benefit in a single
crew (@{"Nutational shields" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD40"}!). Astrophysics is one of those rare skills you
can build a fast and effective space mission deck around. And then the
all-too-often mentioned Klingon skill triade Honor, Leadership,
Diplomacy, but this time in a Federation officer with good stuff to
complement it.

And the stats, well almost a @{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"}.

But there's another thing about her: flexibility in filling crew
requirements. With all the big AU ships around here, an AU icon is never
a big minus (though it makes the card a little riskier). But the catch
is, you can choose to use her either as a commander or an AU which allows
you to staff your ships that much faster (Magic players know this
flexibility from the Dual Lands!). A well-rounded card, and she can get
the @{"Captain's Log" link COTD174} bonus on the @{"Enterprise-C" link COTD153}, making it a whopping 8/10/11
- Ouch!

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #161@{ub}

Hi, folks,

the Romulan fans among you will probably rejoice, here's another card you
wouldn't play if you weren't Rommie or playing against them:


    @{b}QUANTUM SINGULARITY LIFEFORMS@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space, uncommon AU.

If Romulan ship present, all ships and personnel here are placed in
stasis.

Cure with Emergency Transporter Armbands, Timepod Ring or new ENGINEER
arriving.

@{i}"Sentient dimensional beings whose young incubate in black holes. When
nesting in a Romulan ship's artificial singularity engine, a frozen-time
effect occurs."@{ui}


So what. Stasis isn't the worst state to place your opponent into,
as it allows you to use Dead in Bed on her and her personnel are gone for
an indefinite time. If it just weren't for the trouble this gives you.
You need a Romulan ship at the location. So either you use it as a Rommie
hoser (as if we had not enough of that card type) which is best placed at
some location far, far away or you play Rommies yourself, in which case
you have to deposit a ship at the location, empty it and hope for the
best. You can turn the latter one into a nice little bluff: play a lot of
Scouts or Science vessels and then park one ship at a mission you don't
want your opponent to attempt. She'll of course think you have placed
some really nasty Dilemma underneath and probably try and find her points
at some other location, which then of course contain the REAL Dilemmas.

Against Romulans, this card is really strong, IMHO too strong, but it can
of course be prevented by playing a Planet deck (your Rommies won't be
able to do without artifacts, anyway) or by using lotsa non-aligned ships
which you have quite a few fair ones now.

But then, the trouble using against Rommies is: Who plays Rommies ? Very
few people do. And if they do, they don't attempt lots of space missions,
trying for their artifacts and not having too much to gain from a
@{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169}.

So it's rather a nice bluff if playing Rom yourself or at best a
sideboard card.

Nice counter (from Matt): Carry an Yridian Shuttle aboard your warbird!

BTW: Sideboard(ing), a few people have asked. When playing in a CCG
tourney, the tourney rules often allow you to exchange cards from your
deck between rounds with a special stack of cards called your sideboard.
(Usually 1/4 of your normal deck size) This is done to be able to better
adapt to an opponent's strategy. STCCG currently does not know this
concept, but they also don't forbid any deck alteration throughout a
tournament, so IMHO your entire collection currently constitutes your
sideboard.

- Quantum Singularity Lifeforms + Dead in Bed. Arrgh.

Hi, folks,

hope you found this one, as I had Conner post it (away on business trip
:-( ) and your "author search" probably got compromised. Compromised ? As
in


    @{b}COMPROMISED MISSION@{ub}

    Mission, Space, Kli/Rom (opponent: Fed), rare AU.

    35 points

    Span 4

    Treachery x 2 + Computer Skill + STRENGTH > 35

@{i}"Sector 2520: Rush to plug information leaks occuring from this remote
border sector."@{ui}


Another cool mission idea, and it fits the plot: One side tries to cover
the information leaks, the other side tries to find them before that
happens. However, the gameplay sux. At Strength > 35 + 3 Skills, a 40
point reward would have been the least I would have wanted to see. (I
detailed a few issues ago why 35 and 40 makes such a big difference) The
only thing that actually makes it playable is the fact that it is
near-perfectly safe against any sneaky attempts by your opponent to steal
your @{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169} for himself.

Why ? Well, Romulans and Klingons would need to espionage against it and
then be faced with the same high requirements you have to overcome, and
for a Fed crew, both a high Strength and Treachery x 2 are really
unusual. So any Fed opponent would probably just go for a fast win
instead and leave your mission alone. Just too bad it's not a planet. The
fact that you need to waste a @{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169} to secure your artifact
doesn't help the rating of this card whose best use is making sure your
opponent won't be the first to retrieve a crucial artifact.


Favorite combo(s):

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #163@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's an Artifact for a Klingon Armada deck (you'll see later why)

    @{b}RECEPTACLE STONES@{ub}

    Artifact, rare AU.

Place in hand until played as an Event card on the crew of an opponent's
ship. Any space Dilemmas you encounter this turn also apply to that ship
and crew. Discard event.

@{i}"Ves Alkar, a Lumerian, used these mysterious objects in a ritual that
would turn another person into a 'receptacle' for all negative thoughts,
causing rapid aging and death."@{ui}

Before anyone starts a rumor: Ves Alkar is NOT in anyway a relative of
mine :-)

As for the card: Ya all know these 'Heavy Hitter' Fed decks with ships
laden up to the point of bursting? How about decimating them a bit?

First thing to do is get the stones. Then send out an Armada of Klingon
ships, staffed with a Vekor, some ENGINEER and a SECURITY (to give you a
decent chance to hit more Dilemmas). Make sure you have lots of space
missions and one of them has the Tsiolkovsky infection as first Dilemma.
Add a Borg Ship to another mission (plus a K'Vort and a redshirt) for
extra fun.

Now park one ship at each of those missions and play the stones on the
near-bursting opposing vessel. Then attempt all of your missions in quick
succession. You probably won't succeed at all of them and maybe not even
at one, but this is not the point here. Instead, your opponent will
probably find herself facing an assorted variety of Dilemmas she'd rather
not see. The Tsiolkovsky infection hits first (you know where it is), so
your opponent is already deprived of some valuable skills and cannot yet
cure it as she'll first need a chance to act. Next, take your Dilemmas in
any order you want, making sure they all kill or disable somebody if the
conditions are not met. With some luck, you'll decimate the crew far
enough they are no longer able to fly their ship, if not, send in your
redshirt, get the Borg Ship and blast that thingy to bits of Stardust (I
hope you've eliminated enough ENGINEERs so Nutational shields won't be a
problem anymore).

Collect your remaining personnel, destroy outpost, solve one mission, win
game :-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #164@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's another cool ship:


    @{b}TAMA@{ub}

    Ship, non-aligned, rare AU.

    Range 7
    Weapons 9
    Shields 8

    Particle Scattering Device.

    Requires 1 Command (*), 1 Staff (+).

@{i}"Children of Tama. Vorath's sword raised high. @{"Dathon" link COTD181}, speaking first.
Tama and @{"Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} at El-Adrel. Tama's tears, shivering in the wind."@{ui}


Hmm. We've until now seen quite a few ships with a 9, an 8 and a 7
as stats that this might already be called a pattern:

USS Galaxy (8/7/9)
IKC Vor'Cha (9/8/7)
D'Deridex (8/9/7)

So every affiliation has one, right ? Only the non-aligneds have none. Good.
So this has just changed. But wait, how about the crew requirements?
Don't the affiliated ships need 1 command and 2> staff ???
So it seems to me we just got a really good bang for our buck. Though 7 range
is not at all that fast, it's at least faster than the @{"Husnock" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD41"}, has the
same weapons as that one and is easier to fly. So let's put this ship
in an armada deck. Beam @{"Dathon" link COTD181} aboard and use the @{"Captain's Log" link COTD174} which gives
you a nice little 7/12/11 which is now in every respect better than the
@{"Husnock" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD41"} except for that 1 shields and the missing tractor beam.

And the Particle Scattering Device ? Prerequisite for a little event called
Particle Scattering Field. Otherwise useless. So let's explore the one possi-
bility left to us. Fly your Tama to a location your opponent has just
beamed down most of his crew.
At 7/12/11 (with @{"Captain's Log" link COTD174}) you're now quite safe and can sit there
and grin. Leave @{"Dathon" link COTD181} aboard, retrieve your other crewmembers and pursue your
own business. Just keep a Q2 handy in case somebody wants to @{"Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} your
Scattering Field.


Favorite combo(s):

- Tama + @{"Dathon" link COTD181} + @{"Captain's Log" link COTD174}.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #165@{ub}

Hi, folks,

another AU babe you won't want to miss:


    @{b}TASHA YAR - ALTERNATE@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare AU.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 7
    Strength 8

    SECURITY, Honor, Leadership, Armed with Starfleet Type II phaser,
    AU icon, Staff Star (+).

@{i}"Traveled to 2344 and helped prevent a disastrous war. Survivor
of the Battle of Narendra III. Consort of Romulan General. Mother
of @{"Sela" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD23"}."@{ui}


Now this one wins hands down for "coolest AU picture implementation".
Look at her next to the original Tasha. You'll find these cards are
incredibly similar. Same position of face, same camera angle, both
with quite dark background, only the uniform is different - good
job, guys!

And this is not just a picture detail but it is also reflected in the
card itself. She's pretty much the same thing (like majority of the
picture), except for that built-in phaser (the slight difference). Which
is the first of two points why this card is good.

With @{"Yellow Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD53"} and @{"Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}, keeping your @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} in play is less
than assured so actually playing 2 cards' worth of stuff with just one
card to put out means one turn advantage. Even if you have that @{"Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}
and the @{"Traveler" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD4"} it's still half a turn as you still have to count
your card draws. And having 31 cards to draw from a draw deck of 30
is also an aspect of this miracle (assuming 30 seed cards, natch!)
And the second point ? Easy. Tasha is a good card. Even the original
one. But she's unique, so you can't play two of her, right ? NOT!
No colon - no duplication, do you get it ? And two Tashas might make
your opponent think twice about attacking you.

Oh, BTW: You already know AU symbols along with a star can be quite
useful, don't you ?


Favorite combo(s):

- Tasha + Tasha(Alternate), just for laughs.

- Tasha (Alternate) + Phaser burns: Who says you need three cards to pull
  off a Phaser burn ?

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #166@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's another AU variant of an existing card (Uh, guess I'll make a
mini-series of these)


    @{b}BEVERLY PICARD@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare AU.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 8
    Strength 4

    OFFICER, MEDICAL x2, Leadership, Biology, Command Star (*), AU Icon.

@{i}"Captain of medical ship U.S.S. Pasteur in 2395 in an alternate timeline.
Although divorced from @{"Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"}, she never could say no to him."@{ui}


Just to prove not all AU variants are better than the originals. For an
Exobiology skill (rare and valuable) you get a Leadership (all too
common) and for 1 Strength point, you receive the really valueless
OFFICER classification. Although the benefit of the AU icon ("multiland"
effect) also applies for this card, you still lose more than you gain.

Half of Bev Crusher's superior play value was the fact that her skills
matched very well and she could even solve a 35 point mission (Evaluate
Terraforming) on her own. Now this trait is lost and you instead get
the totally unrelated Leadership which will not help you that much in
a bridge crew deck.

And there's another point to remember: @{"Tsiolkovsky infection" link COTD128}. The real
Bev just loses one of her two MEDICAL, but the AU thing loses both (read
the FAQ if you don't believe this!)

And the last point that is worse than the original: Gates McFadden
without her makeup :-)

So don't misunderstand me: She's still a good card. Just not as good as
the real thing. But cheaper. So she will be another @{"Thomas Riker" link COTD119}: Craved
by people who don't have enough cash for real Bridge Crew, but neglected
by all those suitcase players with the entire set.

Hi, folks,

business called again, so I had again to resort to using a minion :-)
to make sure you get this:


    @{b}COMMANDER TOMALAK@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan, rare AU.

    Integrity 7
    Cunning 7
    Strength 9

    OFFICER, Diplomacy, Leadership, Command Star (*), AU Icon.

@{i}"In alternate timeline, the nemesis of the @{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} confronted
@{"Captain Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} but cooperated to investigate an anomaly in the Neutral
Zone."@{ui}


Ahem. Er, this card was a request for review. I normally wouldn't have done
it, but what don't you do to keep the people happy...

Let's compare him to the original Tomalak. He was OFFICER, Diplomacy,
Leadership, Cunning 7, Strength 9, Command Star and - SURPRISE! - Integrity 6.
Whoops. 1 point of Integrity and the "multiland" effect ? And they created
a RARE for this ?

Well, the reason behind this: They urgently needed an AU Romulan. Look
through the cards - there is none. Except the two dual affiliation pals,
but they obviously wanted at least *one* pure Rommie in there. And the
selection was not that great - the show does not help us out very much.

But they could have given him one of the Science-related
skills (Astrophysics or Stellar Cartography) and the card would have been
at least different enough to stand its own.

Oh, and what I said about the original once in the context of one of the
older COTD's still holds true: Why use a Tomalak if I can have a Tebok or
an @{"Evek" link COTD115}?


Favorite combo(s):

- Tomalak + Commander Tomalak, both far away from anything that could
  accidentally or thruthfully be considered my deck.

Hi, folks,

Another counterspell ?


    @{b}REVOLVING DOOR@{ub}

    Event, rare AU.

Plays on any Doorway card or @{"Iconian Gateway" link COTD180}. It is now closed. OR
Nullifies another Revolving Door (discard both) and "re-opens" card
underneath.

@{i}"A surreal door created by an unknown alien intelligence, found by the
@{"U.S.S. Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} on Theta 116 VIII. Open to entry but seemingly closed
to exit."@{ui}


This card is powerful. Very powerful. If you get it in your opening hand
you can cripple any deck that relies on any expansion cards (and which
deck worth that name does not ?). Note that I say any expansion cards,
as the future expansions will include a lot more Doorways and it will
get even worse...

The things you can get from this card are:

1) Slow your opponent's development. Always desirable.
2) Suck a @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}. Always desirable.
3) Kill her Revolving Door she planned to play or already played on your
   AU door in order not to lose your own speed. Always desir... I'm
   getting repetitive.

The risk behind it ? You might encounter an opponent who plays no AU and
no other expansion cards. One lost card. Great deal. Use the remaining 59.
Or you could only get it late in the game. Okay, you should have won by other
means at that point (The 500+ KBytes of COTDs just have to be good for
something:-) )

I'd use it in every deck from the start. You can always sideboard it out
after you've seen what you're up against, but I'd never miss the chance
to beat her horribly on the first game and start the second one with a
comforting lead.

Just don't think of including three of them in your deck to increase your
chances of playing it early. Too many is sometimes worse than too few.
And while you can normally afford to lose one card, losing three is
an entirely different business.

I might also bring back the point of usefulness in several play environments.
Consider (1) High-level play. Carefully tuned decks using every resource
available. You'll need one here - too many good AU cards nobody will pass
up. (2) Low-level play. Decks thrown together of the few cards you possess.
Probably also a decent AU ratio as they can't afford to leave out their
AU and still have a playable deck. If you have one here - use it!
(3) Mid-level play. Different story here. Enough cards to make a decent deck,
but not enough AU to really include a serious AU percentage. Three cards
maybe, just for coolness, but not enough that the Revolving Door will do
massive damage.


Favorite combo(s):

- Counterspells and combos just don't mix.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #169@{ub}

Hi, folks,

back from Stockholm and ready for some new reviews...


    @{b}CRYOSATELLITE@{ub}

    Artifact, rare AU.

Seed at a space location. May seed one additional artifact and up to 3
[AU] icon personnel here. Those personnel come aboard your ship when
mission completed. AU icon.

@{i}"An ancient sublight vessel. Desigend to carry and store cryogenically
frozen humanoids until a cure for their death could be found and used
to regenerate them."@{ui}


Cool thing #1: An artifact that can be seeded at a space location.
Cool thing #2: You can seed personnel cards now - saves you the @{"red alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}...

Trouble: That thingy eats into your Dilemma management.

Details ? Sure.

Up to now, space locations were at best second rate missions because
you had no way of putting an artifact there. Yes, some points, okay,
but nothing that really helped you. Now you can put the satellite here
and store not only a regular artifact but also three characters in
it and thus gain a sudden power boost especially as you don't even
need to play the three personnel you get from your hand - they just wind
up on your ship without any further delay.

So far this is just great. Bad thing IMHO: It takes away four of your
seed cards, meaning that after deducting 6 missions and one outpost, you
have only 19 Dilemmas/Artifacts instead of 23 available (three personnel
and the Satellite itself go off the list).

It won't help a Federation bridge crew deck much. Most of them have
excellent personnel cards and the only thing you need to wait for before
just go screaming through missions is making sure you have one each of
SCIENCE, MEDICAL and SECURITY. So after this, you're probably going to
just blast away and get your 100 points (possibly aided by a
@{"Betazoid Gift Box" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD9"}, which offers you more flexibility as you get to choose the
cards you really need). Although Fed players could put a @{"Ressikan Flute" link COTD177},
a @{"Jack Crusher" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD210"} and @{"Ian Andrew Troi" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD212"} in it and walk away with 10+x
extra points.

Other affiliations have more to gain here, as their skill complement
is less good. So try it with your Romulan deck and put @{"Rakal" link COTD147},
@{"Cmdr Tomalak" link COTD167} and Rasmussen (or @{"Rakal" link COTD147}, @{"Ajur & Boratus" link COTD175}) in it, plus a @{"gift box" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD9"}
or a @{"Horga'Hn" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD10"} and watch the fun begin. If you have a good number of
non-aligned crew, just beam them somewhere together with @{"Rakal" link COTD147} and
sneak in - your opponent will never see it coming before it's too late.

Of course there is another valid use: If you need more than 30 cards in
your draw deck but care for speed, put three less needed support crew
into the satellite and play with an effective draw deck of 33 although
you really only have 30 cards in it.

And last there is the bluff effect: If you both play the same
affiliation, put a not-so fully filled satellite (artifact + only 1 or 2
crew) under one of his missions and then put your outpost there (if you
are second to seed it, otherwise put it next door). Missions with low
requirements work best here. Most opponents will think you just played a
bunch of Dilemmas (especially since you did not play five cards but only
four) and seek their luck somewhere else. Rush in and get the stuff plus
a very easy bunchapoints.


Favorite combo(s):

- Cryosatellite + @{"Betazoid gift box" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD9"}: Did ya say three personnel ? Make
  that six...

- Cryosatellite + @{"Rakal" link COTD147} + Rommie deck with many non-aligneds: Those

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #170@{ub}

Hi, folks,

one of these cards that just could have been cool cause the episode was,
but then turned out to be too weak to really be played for anything but
laughs:


    @{b}INTERROGATION@{ub}

    Event, rare AU.

Plays on one personnel you've captured. Each turn, ask opponent @{i]"How many
lights do you see?"@{ui}. If reply is @{i}"Five"@{ui}, return captive to outpost, score
10 points. Otherwise score 1 point, retain captive.

@{i}"In violation of the Seldonis IV convention, Gul Madred interrogated
@{"Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"}, seeking Starfleet startegic secrets. He kept asking 'How
many lights do you see?'"@{ui}


Well, I think I already told you about the difficulties with cards
concerning captured personnel (See the COTD about @{"Rescue Captives" link COTD159}). But
let's for the moment assume you captured some personnel. And let's for
the sake of your health assume you did not do that by Seize Wesley :-)

So you get some points for free. Almost free that is. You still need to
sacrifice one turn's worth of card play for it. But in this particular
case this is not as bad as it often sounds. As Interrogation takes its
best effect near the end of the game when you are near 100 points (or
near to catching up when you stalled your opponent with a small lead) you
can quite often afford to lose an otherwise possible personnel or ship
play.

Which gets us to the best use of Interrogation: You need at least 90
points and if somehow possible even a few more (96 or so will make for
best effect) Start Interrogating and be sure to ask your question with a
really broad grin on your face. Your opponent will squirm around and say
"4". (Well, what choice does he have). Score one point to put yet some
more pressure on the unfortunate person on the other side of that table.
The one that will realize time is running out. You get the picture: The
one that will just make a really stupid move in a desperate attempt to
score points. Psyched out of the game. Four turns seem so short and yet
you can do so much in them...

Of course, next game you bluff the other way around: This time your
opponent fares a little better. You only managed some 85 or 89 points (or
something in between). So, thinking of that last game, this time he's
smarter and gives in before it's too late. But you know where you seeded
that @{"Sarjenka" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD45"}, don't you ? :-)

Hmmm... STCCG really lacked a good psycho card. Too bad it has such a
nasty prerequisite of needing a captive (HEY Decipher, what happened
about my "attack to capture" rules suggestion ? Did ya forget that ?).
It is really sad: So cool a concept, so much fun to play, such a good
emulation of the episode and you can almost never get it out 'cause
you need a captive first :-(


Favorite combo(s):

- Interrogation + a well-placed @{"Sarjenka" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD45"}.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #171@{ub}

Hi, folks,

I've used so many smileys in COTD, today I'll let our good captain Jean-
Luc use one:


    @{b}TEMPORAL NARCOSIS@{ub}

    Interrupt, uncommon AU.

Plays when opponent uses @{"Horga'hn" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD10"}, @{"Revolving Door" link COTD168},
@{"Emergency Transporter Armbands" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD95"} or Energy Vortex.
Your next turn take a double turn. AU Icon.

@{i}"Debilitating disorientation caused by prolonged exposure to a temporal
disturbance, similar to nitrogen narcosis ('the bends'). @{"Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"}
experienced this in 2369."@{ui}


Hmm. Time Walk (for you Magic Guys)? Good thing to have. If it weren't
just for the fact that it has a prerequisite, so let's analyze that
first.

Your opponent must be using any one of:

@{"Horga'hn" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD10"}: Get your little revenge on him. When he takes double turns, you
are quite justified in doing the same, aren't you ? Too bad yours isn't
permanent but it might get you the one crucial turn.

@{"Revolving Door" link COTD168}: If he just use it to close your AU doorway, you have no
opportunity to play the Narcosis as you need an open door to be allowed
to throw it. So it only apples when your opponent uses the @{"revolving door" link CODT168}
to either reopen his AU door or to kill your @{"Iconian gateway" link COTD180}, both of
which will not be very common uses of the @{"Revolving door" link COTD168}.

@{"Emergency Transporter Armbands" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD95"}: Ah, so your opponent is playing the Oops
card? And then you need an extra turn to beat him? What do you think
the last 170 COTD's were for???

Energy Vortex: Hmm, finally a card we might see and still be able to use
our Temporal Narcosis. So we don't get to play our crucial card and get
an extra turn instead - after the opponent has another chance to do
whatever we wanted to stop him from with the card we just played.  But maybe
we get another turn - err two turns.

To summarize: We have an extra turn usable (a) for somewhat compensating
on an @{"Horga'hn" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD10"}, (b) when somebody closes your @{"Iconian Gateway" link COTD180} or opens
his AU door with a @{"revolving door" link COTD168} instead of a @{"Kevin" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}, (c) when somebody
uses the Vortex to disturb us. (I don't count the @{"ETA" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD95"} here. You don't
need an extra turn if your opponent plays @{"ETA's" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD95"}. Trust me.)

In a tournament, of course you can just count on your opponent having a
@{"Horga'hn" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD10"}. Play your narcosis and get one turn - hopefully the one turn
you need to get your own @{"Horga'hn" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD10"}.

BTW: Timing here. It would be nice to nullify an attempt at closing your
AU door with a @{"Kevin" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} and then to seek some revenge with an extra turn
from the narcosis. Too bad the @{i}"just played"@{ui} time frame ends as soon as
your @{"Kevin" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} resolves :-(


Favorite combo(s):

- Temporal Narcosis + my own @{"Horga'hn" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD10"}: "So you just brought out this cute
  Artifact, wait, I'll take two , [oh here's mine - make that three] turns."

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #172@{ub}

Hi, folks,

there are OFFICERs, ENGINEERs and CIVILIANs, but who can sport an ANIMAL?
Like a


    @{b}TARG@{ub}

    Personnel(?), Klingon, common AU.

    Integrity 4
    Cunning 1
    Strength 5

    ANIMAL, All non-Targ Klingons Strength +1 where present, Nullifies one
    just-played @{"Rogue Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} where present. Universal.

@{i}"Horned, furry, ferocious boar-like animal. A popular Klingon pet.
@{"Lieutenant Worf" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD35"} had one as a child. Heart of Targ is a Klingon delicacy.
This one is male."@{ui}


Whoops, as intelligent as @{"Fek'lhr" link COTD176} and that really means something for a
pig. The idea here is again having a combination of several cards put in
just one. You get a personnel card (well, something similar to a
personnel card), an equipment (half a Klingon disruptor) and a very
specialized reusable variant of @{"Amanda Rogers" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD31"}.

Actually, for evaluating the game effect, the first two functions can be
more or less combined into one, as ANIMAL is currently not a
classification with any use (this might change when Spot comes out) and
so the only value of a Targ besides being a possible Targ-et [pun
intended] for random selection deaths or random male runaways is the
attribute points it provides and its second function (the Strength
enhancer) is geared towards the same goal. So you might actually think of
it as a 4/1/11 card (in any decent away team), thus a slightly weaker
@{"Fek'lhr" link COTD176} you can use without a Holodeck or -projector.

The third function is actually quite interesting as it makes both
variants of the @{"Rogue Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} strategy somewhat more problematic. The "play
one, stop the away team" is ditched to half efficiency (as you will now
need two @{"RB" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} for the same effect) and the "play a big lot and kill
everyone" variation suffers twice as both the added Strength and the
removed @{"RB" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} will work very much in favor of the ship crew. And that's the
point why the Targ is not such a bad card to play. Many people would
probably have treasured an event that makes @{"Rogue Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} half as powerful
as before. Or an equipment that does this.

So why not make it a personnel card, cumulative, with the additional
benefit of some attribute points and the ability to make use of @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}
and @{"Lower Decks" link COTD188}? Hmm. Because nobody will want to play it, will they ?
Crazy world.


Favorite combo(s):

- Targ + @{"Lower Decks" link COTD188} :-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #173@{ub}

Hi, folks,

hope you are ready for the next shot of your favorite addiction:


    @{b}SENIOR STAFF MEETING@{ub}

    Interrupt, uncommon AU.

Plays on ship with OFFICER, ENGINEER, MEDICAL, SCIENCE and SECURITY
aboard, just before the initial attempt at a space mission. First Dilemma
encountered is discarded.

@{i}"Standard operating procedure on starships is to call a meeting of senior
officers or department heads to help find solutions to paramount
problems."@{ui}


Best flavor text in the game. And they want to make us believe they
didn't allude to certain contract troubles ? Yes, they have to say so
officially. But I am not so sure the last two words didn't just slip in
that card text by pure accident.

For the game, you can play three or four of these in a pure space mission
deck. You need five, sorry THREE personnel (Try @{"Wesley" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD26"}, @{"Roga Danar" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD18"} and
@{"Vekor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD37"}!) to discard the first Dilemma at every space mission you attempt.

Your opponent cannot play more than 23 Dilemmas. At least ten of them are
probably planet only. Six more get effectively removed from the game by
you destroying the first Dilemma at every location. Whoops, seven left,
that makes it just one Dilemma at each mission instead of two (or four,
depends on your calculation).

[At least I hope this interpretation is correct. Because they never
clarified what first "encountered" means. Like the first turned up or the
first that is correctly seeded. Just a small difference when your
opponent has six unusable Dilemmas she can slip under the missions to
nullify your Meetings. But this would be against the game spirit as the
Incorrectly seeded Artifact / @{"Palor Toff" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD25"} combo that has already been
outlawed. So let's go by the second definition of "encountered".]

That's all ? Nope! There are those @{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169}/@{"Q" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD30"} players. You seed five
carefully selected Dilemmas designed to cripple your opponent, and she
just seeds a @{"Q" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD30"} below it and cruises through? Play the Staff meeting on
her ship and save your Q2 for that pesky @{"Kevin Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}. Of course you'd
better scan the location first.

And yet another use: When your opponent has that *?'#$ @{"Receptacle Stones" link COTD163}
card on your key ship and you know exactly what nasties are going to
strike you soon, just nullify them before they can do more damage to you
than to her.

Moral: Never think a card has only one use. And don't think it's always
bad to play a card that nullifies some nasty for your opponent...

Hi, folks,

you probably missed me already, but at the moment I have trouble putting
out any COTD's on the weekends as they all seem to get crammed with other
duties, so we will for the next few weeks be reduced to four or five
cards a week. Sorry for that.


    @{b}CAPTAIN'S LOG@{ub}

    Event, uncommon AU.

Plays on table. Any of your personnel aboard a ship he or she commanded
or captained (as referenced in ship lore) raises SHIELDS +3 and WEAPONS
+3. (Not cumulative)

@{i}"A commanding officer's journal of events. While on the surface of
El-Adrel IV, Tamarian @{"Captain Dathon" link COTD181} made entries into his log by hand."@{ui}


This is cute. An upgraded @{"Bynars Weapons Enhancement" link COTD197} and a kind of
@{"Nutational shields" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD40"}, combined in one card. And there are quite a few ships
this works on, and there are more that may get the benefit in future
expansions:

USS Phoenix             Cpt. Benjamin Maxwell
USS Sutherland          @{"Lt. Cmdr. Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"}
@{"USS Enterprise-C" link COTD153}        @{"Cpt. Rachel Garrett" link COTD160}
@{"IKC Pagh" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD70"}                Cpt. Kargan
IKC Hegh'ta             @{"Kurn" link COTD114}
Devoras                 @{"Adm. Mendak" link COTD113}
@{"Decius" link COTD158}                  Tomalak (NOT @{"Cmdr. Tomalak" link COTD167}!)
Gomtuu                  Tam Elbrun
@{"Mercenary Ship" link COTD137}          Baran
@{"Tama" link COTD164}                    @{"Dathon" link COTD181} [this is on the rules sheet]
*USS Yamato             (potential: Cpt. Varley)
*@{"USS Hood" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD82"}               (potential: Cpt. Robert DeSoto)

A few people have of course argued that the @{"Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} should also get
the benefit. I disagree here. The purpose behind this card was, amongst
others, to provide some extra play value to otherwise neglected cards and
definitely NOT to make @{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} and the @{"Enterprise" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD3"} even more desirable.

But I think there are two ships that SHOULD get the benefit, although by
strict rules interpretation, they are out of luck: The Khazara (@{"Toreth" link COTD189})
and the Haakona (potentially Taris). They both read "xxx's Warbird",
which by the rules is not a valid indication of Command. I disagree here,
as the spirit of the card is to add the bonus to any ship card that
mentions its commanding officer. [BTW: The rule sheet explains that
"@{"Dathon" link COTD181}, speaking first" is Tamarian for "He's the captain of the ship"
and thus valid.]

Good choices for the log? @{"Enterprise-C" link COTD153} (@{"Garrett" link COTD160} is a great card and if
you have attack authorization it might make a nice surprise attack),
Sutherland (7/10/10 for two crew is good and @{"Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"} is in most good Fed
decks anyway), @{"Decius" link COTD158} (10/12/11, best attack force for Romulans and the
only fast AU ship that gets the bonus), @{"Tama" link COTD164} (non-aligned and good, as is
@{"Dathon" link COTD181}) and the Hegh'ta (better than the @{"Pagh" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD70"} and 8/10/10 for one crew is
even better than the Sutherland! Also the @{"Pagh" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD70"} is a little dubious, too,
as it says "under the command of" and not "commanded by", but I am
nitpicking. Decipher should publish an official list here...)


And the last one is easily my

Favorite combo:

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #175@{ub}

Hi, folks,

seems I have to create another special edition... And no idea at all for
a Dream Card. So let's return to the basic variant and do two cards in
one article:


    @{b}AJUR & BORATUS@{ub}

    Personnel, Non-aligned, uncommon AU.

    Integrity 1
    Cunning 8 (Ajur) / 5 (Boratus)
    Strength 3 (Ajur) / 7 (Boratus)

    SECURITY, Once per game, if alone with Archaeology on a planet, may
    destroy all but 3 seed cards there (random selection). AU Icon. Staff
    star (Ajur only)

@{i}"A female Vorgon criminal from the 27th century who ruthlessly sought
artifacts with partner Boratus. Hunted the @{"Tox Uthat" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD11"} by returning to
2366."@{ui} (Ajur)
@{i}"Male Vorgon criminal from the future. Aims to steal artifacts with
partner Ajur. Once hunted the @{"Tox Uthat" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD11"} discovered by @{"Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} on
Risa"@{ui} (Boratus)


Two really bad guys. And Integrity 1 only. (Firestorm!) But their special
ability is interesting. Destroying a lot of seed cards can help you or
hurt your opponent. If you ever get to destroy a lot. To make this
ability work, you need a location with at least four seed cards. And this
is not too probable, taking into consideration that you deduct 6
missions, 1 outpost and 1 AU door from your seed deck of maximum 30, so
the average number of seed cards per location is always below 4.

So they really only work against a deck that piles huge lots of Dilemmas
under one location. And in this case they work somewhat like a
@{"Senior Staff meeting" link COTD173}, destroying a few Dilemmas, with the risk to also remove
your crucial artifact. Hmm. Two cards instead of one, all the risks
involved, and just getting rid of a few measly dilemmas ? Nah, Better put
a few good personnel in my deck and overcome the Dilemmas in the regular
way. (Although there is one handy thing about them: Most players have no
way of keeping track of card order under the mission when randomly
selecting, so it might upset a carefully planned combination just by
reordering - imagine what it would do to my @{"Mirror Universe" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD100"}
combo...)

'Nother idea ? Yep. Better ? No. Play Ajur and Boratus and Vorgon
Raiders. Argh. A rare interrupt that needs two more rares to be playable
is not my idea of a good CCG card. And the fact that they all three are
destroyed makes it even worse. And all for one artifact. Nah. Better go
and recover one of mine from under a mission and get the points.

There actually IS a good use for the two, but that's part of a
soon-to-appear DOTW article (Hope I did not say too much here), so I'll leave
it as is and update the webpage with a revised edition some time next
week.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #176@{ub}

Hi, folks,

hope you found this "cloaked" edition of COTD. Hey, stop using those
author searches and go by title :-). Oh, did I say "cloaked" ? Like in


    @{b}I.K.C. FEK'LHR@{ub}

    Ship, Klingon, rare AU.

    Range 11
    Weapons 9
    Shields 8

Cloaking Device, Holodeck, Tractor Beam, requires 1 Command (*), 1 Staff (+),
and 2 AU icons.

@{i}"Destroyed U.S.S. Pasteur in an alternate future, only to be thwarted by
the future Enterprise. Named for the ferocius Guardian of Gre'thor."@{ui}


Remember the @{"Decius" link COTD158}? Here's the Klingon equivalent. Only that it is not
even close to being as good. Why ? For the one single extra range you need
another AU character, and even though the Klingons have two decent AU
personnel, you will need at least one non-aligned to make sure you
can play the ship. And the Holodeck is also not even nearly as useful for
the Klingons as it is for the Romulans, who have a good (and common) Holo-Doctor
and a decent Engineer, compared to the lone @{"K'Tesh" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD69"} the Klingons have.
And no way to use the @{"Captain's Log" link COTD174}!

And they do this to an affiliation whose strength lies so much in ships ?
Yes, the card looks good, but it isn't. Too costly for a Klingon Armada
deck, the range increment from 10 to 11 is not that great and the extra
crew requirements hurts too much. That's it. Nothing more to say. :-(


Favorite combo(s):

- Nope, not here.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #177@{ub}

Hi, folks,

this might be a repost for you. But there have been some problems
concerning this issue, so I put it up again.


    @{b}RESSIKAN FLUTE@{ub}

    Artifact, rare AU.

Immediately play on table. X varies constantly, where X=5 points for each
of your Music personnel in play. Destroy with @{"the Devil" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD78"}. (Not
duplicatable.)

AU Icon.

@{i}"Artifact from Kataan, a now-dead planet. 1,000 years after Kataan's demise,
a space probe gave @{"Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} this flute and a lifetime of memories
in less than an hour."@{ui}


@{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"}, @{"Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"}, @{"both" link COTD119} @{"Rikers" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD19"}, Neela Daren, Jenna D'Sora, McKnight,
@{"Jack Crusher" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD210"}, @{"Ian Andrew Troi" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD212"}, L'Kor, Amarie. A rather short list. But a list
that contains a lot of personnel I'd play anyway. It is almost like 20
free points.

And there is a surprise value in here, too. If you suddenly can win by
just dropping a card or two, some opponents will get very careful. And it
is very safe from destruction, too. And it gives you a chance at a
degenerate deck: Risa Shore Leave (with outpost and Flute), 5 other
missions, some Dilemmas, 3 Red Alerts (not tourney legal!), 15 McKnights,
@{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"}, @{"Data" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD7"}, 2 Amaries, 2 Alexanders, 4 @{"Vekors" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD37"}, Jenna,
2 @{"Genetronic Replicators" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"}, events and interrupts to taste seasoned with some card
drawing ability (@{"Kivas" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD49"}).
(Hey Serge, I devised this before I read yours, but you had the same idea
:-) )

Fill your hand with McKnights (only universal Music) and solve the
Mission for 30. Then drop them all in one turn and win. Get the pattern?
Just too bad there is no equivalent for the other affiliations. They have
at best two (Klingon) or one (Romulan) Musician on the table, so their
only use for the Flute is to prevent the Fed guy from using his.

Or, think of it as a counter for @{"The Higher... the Fewer" link COTD155} (as in Blue
Lightning, last DOTW). I already said how ten points can hurt, but if you
can get them back it is as good as if you had never lost them!

Good addition to any Fed deck, just unusable for everybody else.

Hi, folks,

those of you still reading rec.games.trading-cards.misc: Be warned, I
will no longer be on that group beginning from @{"#180" link COTD180}. Please you all move
over to the rec.games.trading-cards.startrek group where we now have our
new home.

Today it's time for a BIG nasty:


    @{b}KLIM DOKACHIM@{ub}

    Event, uncommon AU.

Plays on table. When opponent reports a unique personnel for duty,
opponent draws no cards at end of that turn.

@{i}"Zakdorn quartermaster controlling the Starfleet surplus depot at
Qualor II. A typical bureaucrat of the type that delights in delays that make
life difficult for officers"@{ui}


Bureaucrat ? Hmm. Sounds I invented this some time before (See the Dream
Card article on @{"Court-Martial" link COTD103}), and of course we play this with the house
rule "Unless Bureaucracy present, opponent draws..." and our Dream
Card personnel.

But back to the real game. This card is awful. Unless you happen to have
it on your side. Even the poorest kid has some unique uncommons and every
time one of them is played, you lose a card draw, effectively halving
your throughput in cards. And you cannot even circumvent it with some
extra draw effects like the @{"Traveler" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD4"}. Only a @{"Kivas" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD49"} works here. And that
one costs you your card play for that turn. Dang.

At least there is one card that partially neutralizes it: @{"Red Alert!" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}
If you have an @{"Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} on the table, you can at least dispose of a lot of
uniques at the same time. And lose only one card draw with it. Which
gets me to the best killer combo since Gaps in Normal Space +
@{"Subspace Warp Rift" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD83"}: Klim Dokachim + @{"Yellow Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD53"}! Play these two, and your
opponent will need at least TWO @{"Uxbridges" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} to get back to any kind of
speed unless he plays a deck with nearly all universal crew. And while
he's getting those two @{"Kevins" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}, you score some points. Like 100. Or so.
Of course that means nuking your own @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}, so you'd better have some
decent crew on the table before you play the @{"Yellow Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD53"}. Or you just
@{"Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} your opponent's @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} before playing Klim and he'll be
busy getting it back out of his discard pile. (Remember- only one
@{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} per deck under tourney rules!).

IMHO this card became way too strong. Like @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} itself. It becomes
more and more a match on who draws which cards first. If I get my @{"Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}
out before you get your Klim and you can't nuke it, I am safe.
Other wise I'm in trouble. We will see yet more @{"Kevins" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"} now. Almost a little
boring. Like Channel in Magic.


Favorite combo(s):

- Klim Dokachim + @{"Yellow Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD53"} - after having made some serious use
  of my own @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}.

it was

draw a card."@{ui} But for this it would have to be an interrupt (playable on
his turn!). It is easy to misread BTW. Just place the punctuation
a little differently and you actually get his interpretation.
Grammatically correct and everything! Rating not figured in for average.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #179@{ub}

Hi, folks,

here's something for a Klingon Armada deck:


    @{b}LATINUM PAYOFF@{ub}

    Interrupt, common AU.

Plays if Greed aboard your ship when it destroys another ship in battle.
X=3 bonus points for each OFFICER aboard destroyed ship. (Not cumulative)

@{i}"Gold-pressed latinum, which cannot be replicated, is a valuable metal
used as currency in many less-developed sectors, primarily outside
Federation space."@{ui}


This card makes an entirely new deck type possible: A deck that does
never even attempt to solve any missions! So don't care about putting
together good crews, just man your Armadas of K'Vort class ships with one
OFFICER each and blow away your opponent's ships! Try to seed a high
number of Dilemmas so you get to seed your outpost last and get it as
close as possible to your opponent's. Then, play five ships and five crew
(hopefully aided by @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} and some card-drawing ability). Wait until
she gets a ship out, then blow away the outpost. Then battle the ship and
play a Latinum payoff. 3 or 6 points - instant Victory and very hard to
defend against. There are unfortunately only three OFFICERs with Greed,
none of them universal, so you will need a little luck, but you can also
add the Duras family (all three leaders and greedy). Which means you need
only eleven cards to win (plus the one @{"Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}). Seven of them in your
hand, five more to draw, that means five turns. Nearly no deck will get
any mission points that fast unless they have a very lucky draw.

BTW: You can get more than just the 3/officer out of one enemy ship. But
you need to destroy it with an Armada. The "not cumulative" means you
cannot play it twice on one ship, but if they attack together, they can
each gain the bonus. (Big unintended rules loophole!)

The card is thus interesting, however you will need to build an entire
deck around it. And that's its weakness. You cannot really just throw
it into a good deck in order to make it better. You have to build a new
one entirely from scratch. But try it - nasty surprise and even the best
defense will get your opponent only a draw.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #180@{ub}

Hi, folks,
here comes the fastest "ship" in the Universe:

    @{b}ICONIAN GATEWAY@{ub}

    Artifact, rare AU.

Place in hand until played on a planet location as an Event card. While
in play, anyone's personnel and equipment can move instantly from Iconian
Gateway to any other planet(s).<BR>

@{i}"The now-extinct Iconians were "Demons of Air and Darkness" due to their
advanced technology such as this instant transport portal to farflung
planets."@{ui}

Too bad it is one-way. But then, what did they print these Enterprise-C
cards for ? So there is a way to come back.

Best use: Place on your outpost, distribute your personnel all over the
spaceline wherever you need the new crewmembers. Like putting them in
play at any planet location. Which means any of your locations if you
play six planets, right? So who needs those ship cards? Okay, let's
put in an Enterprise-C or two to get your folks back home.

Second best use: Retrieve a stranded crew at any location where you
once had a ship. Like the victims of a bunch of Love Interests.
But in this case your opponent can also use it. At your outpost, he'll
think twice about it, especially if you play Klingons and have that
Echo Papa Drone lying in your backyard.

Third use: Set up a pair of these and use them as instant teleporters.

Further ideas:
- Send out some Engineers to build extra outposts. (This one actually
  works well with a Devidian Door, too.)
- Get a crew past that pesky Q-Net.
- Send a team to battle an overconfident opponent's away crew.

Oh, and the fact my opponent can also use it? Well, you are not going
to leave it unguarded, right?

The strength of this card lies in its versatility, speed and surprise
factor. Hmm... aren't these the three major components of a GREAT card ?

Favorite combo(s):

- Iconian Gateway + Enterprise-C: Swarm out and find a way to get back.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #181@{ub}

Hi, folks,

@{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} and @{"Gowron" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD5"} in COTD. Color of the sun. The riddle unsolved.


    @{b}DATHON@{ub}

    Personnel, non-aligned, rare AU.

    Integrity 9
    Cunning 8
    Strength 6

    OFFICER, Diplomacy x 2, Leadership, Honor,
    Nullifies Tamarian-related Dilemmas where present,
    Command Star (*).

"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. The Beast of Tanagra. Rosani, his army.
@{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} and Dathon at El-Adrel. Sokath, his eyes uncovered!"@{ui}


(by popular demand this review will be conducted in English)


Hmm. 9/8/6, OFFICER, Diplomacy x 2, Leadership, Honor? Seems somebody has
taken this from a very well-known blue card and just changed the second
line in the skill box. Which is a very nice touch, as these two were very
evenly matched in the episode, so why not make them very similar?

And still, this time they created two similar cards which are by far
different enough to stand their own. One is just a good Fed Officer, the
other is non-aligned and has a special ability which might come in very
handy. One of the favorite combos of @{"Outpost Raid" link COTD183} players is to play
that one behind a Shaka, when the walls fell so it cannot be redshirted -
NOT! Shaka gets nullified by Dathon, so even if you have no other use for
him (shame on you) he makes a great @{"Outpost Raid" link COTD183} sucker. And who says
you can't have a second one in your deck to use after the first has
fallen prey to the @{"outpost raid" link COTD183} (one of the few cases where duplicating a
unique personnel might prove useful).

The other Tamarian-related Dilemma which currently exists is El-Adrel
Creature. Also nice touch: If @{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} and Dathon are alone on the planet,
the creature would kill one of them. Exactly one. But I believe Dathon
can nullify it, as it mentions him in the lore and thus should be
considered Tamarian-related. Can a Netrep back this ?

And of course, use him with @{"Tama" link COTD164}. Plus @{"Captain's Log" link COTD174}. 7/12/11 for two
crew (yes, take a @{"Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} with him :-) ). Great ship then.


Favorite combo(s):

- Dathon + Picard. Just cool.

And today I present you a new STCCG challenge: Lay out a spaceline of six
missions of your choice. Put one Dilemma (of your choice) under each
mission.
Seed any other cards you like. Stack a draw deck (you arrange in whatever
way you choose, but only one of each card). Draw a starting hand and play
one turn. What is the maximum points possible ? If you get more than 300
you have beaten me!
(You may use a @{"Devidian Door" link COTD146}, but you must have it on your hand at the
end of the turn! And the @{"Horga'hn" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD10"} is of course not usable to get a second

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #182@{ub}

Hi, folks,

there still is one category of cards that this series NEVER touched.
After 181 episodes, still there is not a single equipment! (And back
when @{"#50" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD50"} was current, I ran a survey and the majority voted for LESS
equipment reviews!!! How?) Anyway, in spite of that, I'll change my
policy and do a flick on:


    @{b}ECHO PAPA 607 KILLER DRONE@{ub}

    Equipment, rare AU.

Use during Away Team or @{"Rogue Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} battles. First time used in battle, STRENGTH=10. Next time
used in a separate battle, STRENGTH=20, etc.

@{i}"A deadly hovering anti-personnel device with the ability to fire phasers and to anticipate
and adapt to its target's defenses. Created by the Arsenal of Freedom
on Minos."@{ui}


A fair addition to a Klingon battle deck or a @{"Rogue Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} deck.

The first one is quite straightforward: Carry it with you. Start as many
battles as possible. Hmm. Can't we optimize on this? (Well, we can, other-
wise I wouldn't ask such a stupid question :-) )

The drone grows with separate battles and you're probably not going to lose
a battle with 40 STRENGTH, okay? So bring a big crew to a planet. Beam down
the drone and 30 STRENGTH. Attack. Kill opposing crewman. Beam down
20 STRENGTH. Add drone (new team - new battle!) Kill opposing crewman. Beam
down one Klingon Officer (your opponent has lost some STRENGTH). Pass drone.
Attack. Kill oppo- this is getting boring. You have another Klingon waiting?
Beam down, attack, kill. You get it. Eliminate 4 instead of 1 in one turn
and get your drone up to 50. Then pass it to a lone Officer with Strength=3
and start wreaking havoc. (Yes, equipment cannot get stopped!)

The @{"Rogue Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} deck is a little more complicated: If you get Crosis
and a few @{"Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} on the first turns, you need not worry. But what if you have
very few @{"Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} in your starting hand or your opponent sits merrily on his
outpost solving a planet mission from there and then using @{"Iconian Gateway" link COTD180}
to transport so you cannot use your @{"RB" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} at all? Easy - play them on yourself!
Man a Pi or Scout ship with one Romulan. Any OFFICER. Hand him a Drone. Play
a @{"RB" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} on your own ship. Battle. Play next @{"RB" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"}. Battle.  Repeat until satisfied. Beam down crewman plus 60-Strength
Echo Papa at opponent's outpost. Grin. Solve a mission. Win.

BTW: You'd need ten @{"RB" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} (or five including a Crosis) to get a better net
effect using them directly on your opponent than using them on the Drone.


Favorite combo(s):

- Echo Papa Drone plus @{"Rogue Borg" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD33"} on own crew - it's soooo sneaky!

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #183@{ub}

Hi, folks,

care for another game of Poker ?


    @{b}OUTPOST RAID@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space/Planet, common AU.

If at your outpost: two personnel are killed (opponent's choice) unless
STRENGTH >81. Discard Dilemma. OR Elsewhere:  requires STRENGTH >18 to
pass.

@{i}"Rogue Borg conducted a brief but deadly raid on the remote Federation
outpost Ohniaka III in 2369. 274 personnel were lost."@{ui}


Except for the fact that the picture is way wrong (it's from Lore's
headquarters in Descent II), this is a cute psych card.

The catch is to guess where your opponent will be placing his or her
outpost. Or to play six outpost raids :-).

The latter strategy might not be that effective as you'll lose 10% of
your deck to gain one truly effective Dilemma, so let's concentrate on
the psych play with one or two outpost raids.

Likely candidates? Let's consider two missions: Diplomatic Conference
and Evaluate Terraforming. The first one is a big point thing that has
hard requirements and needs personnel from multiple affiliations to
solve. So the only way to do it from your outpost is to use a Neutral
one, play Fed crew, beam down, play Klingons, beam them down
too (only one affiliation at a time at a neutral outpost!) then finally
bring in the Romulans (your order may vary) and then solve the mission.
Considering you need seven or eight crew to cope with the mission and the
more common Dilemmas, this is not a very likely starter mission.

Now take Evaluate Terraforming. 35 points, Geordi+Medical or
Med+Bio+Exobio, both not too hard for any decent bridge crew deck and
both combinations tend to provide valuable skills towards possible
Dilemmas. So this looks like a typical hiding place for a Betazoid gift
box or a Horga'hn. Hmm. As people want these early, wouldn't this
be a good outpost location ?

And there's the big strategy. When the missions are on the table think
"Where would I  place my outpost if I had her missions ?" That is the
likely location, so put it there. Prime candidates are low-to medium
point planet locations that can be done with one crewmember (artifact
gainers) or a low-point space mission that seems to attract a lot of seed
cards (that Cryosatellite plus contents).

But whenever you seed the Raid, make sure you place some other Dilemma
before it that requires several crew to pass. Shaka and Hologram ruse
qualify. Just to avoid redshirting away your prime problem.


Favorite combo(s):

- Outpost raid + Shaka. Always nails something GOOD.

Hi, folks,

I was asked for more commons by those players (beginners :-) ) who do not
have all the rare (good :-) ) cards to build their decks with. In order
to fulfill everyone's desires (avoid being flamed :-) ) I'll try my best
(once make the impression of :-) ) to introduce more common (crappy :-) )
cards into COTD. And I'll also try (promise but never keep :-) ) to use
less Smileys (:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) ).
[It is so hard to come up with a witty introduction every day]


    @{b}FERENGI ATTACK@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet, common AU.

Kills one Away Team member (opponent's choice) unless total CUNNING +
STRENGTH >68 OR Greed present. Discard dilemma.

@{i}"Ferengi attacked a Federation Away Team on a planet in the Delphi Ardu
system using 'whips' which fire discharges of high-energy plasma."@{ui}


The good thing about it: It is an "opponent's choice" kill. Always useful
for strategic away team surgery. Maybe eliminating that Bev Crusher
before hitting with a Hyper-Aging and a Matriarchal Society? Or killing
the only Security right in front of a Barclay's?

These always tend to be the best Dilemmas as they improve the chances of
striking with the really big stuff. If they catch. And there is the
problem again. Not that Greed would be that common (at least not among
Feds and Klingons), but there are on the other hand a handful of decent
non-aligneds with Greed. And do not forget the other requirement.
Overcoming STRENGTH+CUNNING>68 should be no big problem for a decent
team of 7. And none at all for any team of nine. Oh, did I say big away
teams ? And The Higher... The Fewer?

By ORing both requirements you get a Dilemma that is quite easy to pass.
Like many Dilemmas :-(. And worse, it can be redshirted without any
danger and as it is a preparatory Dilemma, not a big hitter usually
placed last, you won't find much stuff to put in front of it and still
have enough Dilemmas left for the other locations.

One minor point on against whom to play: It's better against Feds than
against anyone else.

Not much more to say. Let's stop here.
What was this ? You say you paid for more than 15 lines ? Grumble...
Okay, here's something for you all to discuss, inspired by the flavor
text of above card:


    @{b}FERENGI ENERGY WHIP@{ub}

    Equipment, uncommon, unfortunately not yet printed.

Assign to any non-aligned personnel card. That card's STRENGTH is doubled
OR if it is a Ferengi, STRENGTH is tripled. If personnel is killed,
destroy the whip.

@{i}"Energy weapon used by Ferengi until around 2365. Very powerful, but very

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #185@{ub}

Hi, folks,

for those of you who actually do play treaty decks:


    @{b}K'MTAR@{ub}

    Personnel, Klingon, rare AU.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 8
    Strength 8

    V.I.P., Diplomacy, Leadership, Honor,
    Attributes all +5 if with Alexander Rozhenko,

    Command Star (*), AU Icon.

@{i}"@{"Worf's" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD35"} son Alexander returned from 40 years in the future to influence his younger self
to embrace the way of the warrior and avoid life as a peacemaker."@{ui}


A powerful personnel card. 8/8/8 is near the best attribute combinations
(and the additional +5/+5/+5 makes it even better), VIP's are not the
worst thing (at least since we got AU, they were rather crappy before
that), and of course you get the classic Diplomacy / Honor / Leadership
trio.

But many players despise this card because "it only benefits you if you
play a not-so-good card, and even from a different affiliation". Hmm. Is
that really worth condemning the card?

Let's see. I'll break it down by the scheme for the personnel power ratings
(find them on LDP's webpage). 8/8/8 attributes = 24. VIP = 3. Diplomacy = 7.
Leadership = 4. Honor = 4. Command Star = 2. Total so far 44. Good for a
Klingon. (They really do not have much choice above 50 where the really
good personnel starts.) The special ability is worth another 5+5+5 = 15.
Divided by two, as you need two cards to make it work. So, make that 7.5
additional points. Or a gain of less that 20%.

But people always fall for this. Quick excursion into Magic (if you don't
play that, skip this paragraph): Ice Age's Rime Dryad.
Snow-covered Forestwalk = Crap. I agree. So the card is crap? Nope.
There is no other 1/2 creature for one mana. He's almost a Savannah Lion.
Which is a very highly appreciated card in most circles.

So, card game designers, listen up: If you want to make a good card that
only really good players use, add a crappy special ability in prominent
type. You can be sure most players will overlook that the card would be
great even without the nearly useless ability. Not as extreme here with
K'mtar, but I guess you see the point. Don't judge a book by its cover.


Favorite combo(s):

- K'mtar + Alexander. Did you expect something else :-) ?

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #186@{ub}

Hi, folks,

A card they obviously had to make. But then, couldn't it have done
something better ?


    @{b}THE MASK OF KORGANO@{ub}

    Event, common AU.

Plays on one of your personnel. While in play, changes it from normal to
AU icon personnel or vice versa.

@{i}"In legend, Masaka was chased by Korgano across the sky like the Terran
moon chases the sun. @{"Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} masked himself as Korgano to fool
Masaka."@{ui}


Two uses, one card. So far this is good (remember my insistence on
flexibility ?) Use #1: Remove an AU icon from one of your personnel
cards. Oops. The only time I would prefer not having an AU icon is when I
have to play the card and my AU door somehow gets closed. But I cannot
use the mask on a personnel just being played (by card text and by the
rules - I cannot play an event in the same turn as personnel even with a
@{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}). Net result: Nil.

Use #2: Add an AU icon. Better. I could need that to seed a personnel
under a @{"cryo" link COTD169}... NOT! It only works on cards in play, so again, zip.
Or, I could use the extra AU to add to the staffing requirements of a
good AU ship. Hmm. Shouldn't I rather put another AU personnel in my deck
instead? One that has an AU icon like the mask can give, but also adds
some skills and attributes and does not even cost me a turn when I have a
@{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}? Grmph.

But there is still one situation left open. What if I want to remove the
staffing requirements from one of my ships to stop it from moving ? Which
of course only applies when my ship is controlled by something nasty like
@{"Cytherians" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD47"}, as otherwise I can just stop. Hmm. @{"Cytherians" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD47"} or
@{"Incoming message" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD68"}? Why should I delay getting rid of the nasty if I cannot remove
it anyway ? And even if I would, why not just use an
@{"Emergency Transporter Armband" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD95"} and beam somebody off at the nearest planet ? Zero,
fourth time.

And that is the final rating for myself (you'll find some disagreement
from others) Zero. Err, One, to go by the rules.


Favorite combo(s):

- You playing a deck with 5 masks against me.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #187@{ub}

Hi, folks,

I had some access trouble yesterday, so no COTD then, but I am back...
With the new top slot mission:


    @{b}DIPLOMATIC CONFERENCE@{ub}

    Mission, Planet,AU rare

    Span 4
    60 points
    Fed, Kli, Rom

One V.I.P from each of three affiliations + one non-aligned V.I.P.

@{i}"Parliament: Participate in historic interstellar conference at this
neutral diplomatic site."@{ui}


I have already seen several decks built around this card (with varying
success). It really is an "all or nothing" card. Not only do you need
four personnel from four different affiliations (thus requiring a 3-color
deck), but you also must overcome any Dilemmas seeded here, a task at
which the various V.I.P's will not excel.

Also, you will practically need to seed three outposts (possibly and best
all three at the Diplomatic Conference), as a neutral outpost would
require making three trips by ship to the conference location (can only
be seeded at space locations). And remember, your V.I.P.'s can only
cooperate here unless you have the appropriate treaty.

Personnel choices:

Non-aligned is quite easy. You will need all of them. All two. You cannot
afford having just one and your choice is not that good. I'd prefer
@{"Maques" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD218"} for the higher Integrity (Firestorms). Neither is AU (icon), so no
@{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169}, either.

Romulan: Your obvious choice should be @{"Major Rakal" link COTD147}. She is dual
affiliation, allowing you to use her as what you need, AU for your
@{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169} and she can ride your Fed ships even if you need her as a
Rommie later. For the second slot, I'd recommend @{"Sela" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD23"} or Pardek.

Klingon: They have more than enough V.I.P.'s, but the prime choice is
@{"Governor Worf" link COTD151} (AU and SECURITY), followed by the Duras clan and
@{"Gowron" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD5"}. Pick any complement for our fave ridge-guy.

Federation: Apart from the Janus-headed @{"Rakal" link COTD147}, @{"Sarek" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD72"} would probably be
your best choice (Mindmeld, nice to have against the "need ... x2"
Dilemmas). Beyond, you have to select between Tam Elbrun and Kareel Odan.
Again, no AU so no @{"Cryosatellite" link COTD169} (except @{"Rakal" link COTD147}, natch).

General result: The mission is too hard for 60 points. You still have to
solve a second mission and the skills needed don't really overlap
(although you might try First Contact and @{"Diplomacy mission" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD66} when mostly
Fed). Apart from the VIP's you at least need a @{"Vekor" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD37"} and a @{"Roga Danar" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD18"} for
the Dilemmas (two more cards) and a @{"Vulcan Mindmeld" link COTD132} in hand to flexibly
cope with some nasty Dilemmas. A theme deck card.


Favorite combo(s):

- Diplomatic Conference + @{"Sarek" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD72"} + @{"Rakal" link COTD147} + @{"Gov. Worf" link COTD151} +
  any non-aligned VIP.

- Diplomatic Conference + many (>=5) artifacts + @{"Ajur + Boratus" link COTD175} +
  Vorgon Raiders.

- (c) by Serge: Diplomatic Conference + @{"Devidian Door" link COTD146} +
  @{"Ophidian Cane" link COTD154}.
  Solves you some transportation troubles.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #188@{ub}

Hi, folks,

Magic-ians have their Crusades, we have


    @{b}LOWER DECKS@{ub}

    Event, uncommon AU.

Plays on table. While in play, all of your non-holographic, universal
personnel are each CUNNING +2, INTEGRITY +2 and STRENGTH +2 (Not
cumulative.)

@{i}"Junior officers aboard all starships cooperate in their duties while
competing for promotion and advancement, such as Ensigns Taurik, Sito,
Lavelle and Ogawa."@{ui}


A good card for our green pointy-eared friends. They have by far the best
universal personnel (and the worst uniques) and work well together with
the non-aligned universals. Klingon and Federation decks have far less to
gain from this card as these afiliations cannot sport good universals and
also have less to gain from some extra attribute points.

The best deck design for this card is a stall deck, a deck type well
suited for Romulans. You can
- play a nearly all-universal deck, complemented by a few uniques and be
  quite sure not to lose anybody to Firestorms.
- combine it with @{"Klim Dokachim" link COTD178} to delay your opponent
- start away team battles with your powered-up crews
- tolerate a pretty slow development of your own forces, instead making
  sure your opponent's development is even worse.

Unfortunately it does not add any skills. (Skills are that much more
important than attributes in this game) Wouldn't it be great to have a
card that "doubles first-listed skill of all universals in play"? (Hint
to Q: This is a suggestion for the next expansion :-) ).

Other cute li'l ideas:
- add a Lower decks to your 15 McKnight / @{"Ressikan Flute" link COTD177} deck.
- use it with some Strength 8 Klingons (Divok and Kromm, several each)
  for Brute Force.
- add to a Fed deck and play @{"Q" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD30"} to get rid of Dilemmas
- play missions with high attribute requirements (remember, you are
  boosted from 5 to 7 on the average). Explore Black Cluster, anyone?


Favorite combo(s):

- Lower Decks + Disruptor in an attack deck

- Lower decks + Romulan Integrity 3 or 4 personnel

Hi, folks,

today I'll give my webpage maintainers a headache as they'll have some
trouble finding a suitable expansion symbol graphic for

    @{b}DATA LAUGHING@{ub}
    Interrupt, print run 500,000. Promotional.

    Nullifies Calamarain OR doubles Data's Head this turn OR retakes one
    ship controlled by Lore returns so that Lore and Rogue Borg now follow
    your direction.

@{i}"When Lt. Commander Data rescued the temporarily mortal Q from the
Calamarain in 2366, Q awarded him with the gift of laughter."@{ui}

One card, three ways to play.

1) Nullifies Calamarain. We'll see. Perhaps next expansion. Until then,
   not very useful :-)
2) retake a RB controlled ship and control it yourself. Take some
   revenge. In the not so likely case your ship has completely been run
   over by RB before the game is over, play Data Laughing and start
   shooting at your opponent. Not a bad ability, but too rarely usable.
   Like almost never.
3) double Data's Head for a turn. Now we are getting somewhere. An
   additional Cunning of 10 plus Computer Skill plus the +4/+4/+4 on the
   ship, seems like a good thing to me.

Wait?!? Do I smell something here? The strongest weapons are 10, right?
On the Edo vessel and the FE. Plus two for Bynars, two for the head and
two for Data laughing makes 16. Add a Kurlan Naiskos for a whopping 48.
Goodbye Borg ship! With one shot!!! (Works better with the FE as there is
no risk of having the attack nullified). And at Range 51 (for FE) you are
not likely to get stranded.

The Shields of 39 (again, FE) are only a bonus, nobody really needs more
than 24. Works best if you have two Borg ships at locations you know.
(No, you don't need three as you have to solve at least one mission to
get the artifacts). But you have some time to spare, as your opponent's
outpost won't last that long (nor will her ships).

Oh, what's so Data Laughing about this strategy? Easy, it gets you the
final points needed to push yourself up to the magic 48.

To finalize: One really good use, one very limited and one unknown yet
(but maybe very good.) For the time being, more of a collector's card
than one you urgently need for your play deck. Only cool. (What is this?)

Oh, BTW: this cute little card was a gift to me by Conner. Now if some
store wants a well-read advertising line right here, I could still use a
Future Enterprise... :-)

Favorite combo(s):

- Data's Head + Kurlan Naiskos + Bynars + Data Laughing. Try with a
  runabout and make your opponent wince at having lost her outpost to a
  runabout...

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #190@{ub}

Hi, folks,

need a captive or two?


    @{b}CARDASSIAN TRAP@{ub}

    Dilemma, Either, uncommon AU.

Unless Empathy present, opponent captures one unique, non-Cardassian
personnel from you (random selection) and places it on their side as a
captive, along with trap.

"With rumors of a metagenic weapon on Celtris III, the Cardassians lured
@{"Jean-Luc Picard" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD1"} into a trap in Cardassian space. He was captured in
2369."@{ui}


A good one. As it scores well in all three categories for a Dilemma:

- Versatility. You don't get any better than a planet/space thingy.

- Chances of striking. Fair to good against Feds, really great against
  anybody else.

Empathy is not very common and the few that have it are not really good
crew. Klingons strike the big zero here (do you want to play with
@{"Devinoni Ral" link COTD142} or @{"Maques" link "STCCG.cotd300.guide/COTD218"}? If the former, you'd better make sure he does
not get into a Firestorm and if the latter, you have a good empath who is
pretty useless for anything else.), Rommies at least have their @{"Rakal" link COTD147}
which can be used for some sneaky purposes (like solving an opponent's
Fed mission with her and some non-aligneds...)

- Effect. Better than the omnipresent 'kill one crewmember'. True, the
  captured guy can be freed, but on the other hand you get at least a
  decent personnnel (unique) and he could be interrogated, brainwashed,
  tortured (future expansion - see @{"Rescue captives" link COTD159}), etc. And don't
  forget that capturing cannot be avoided by @{"Genetronic Replicators" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"},
  redirected by @{"Security Sacrifices" link COTD141}or reclaimed by @{"Res-Qing" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD28"}.

How to combine: Against Klingons, put behind a Firestorm. No @{"Devinoni Rals" link COTD142}
that could spoil your plot. Against Fed, try with a @{"Female's love interest" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD74"}
to maybe get rid @{"Troi" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD39"}. Or, use with any Dilemma that allows
you to choose which one goes away. And the other way round: Use as a
preparation for something even nastier. Remember you don't get to choose
which one goes, but you at least can be pretty sure that you are not
drawing a total dud (unless your opponent plays @{"Mot the Barber" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD24"} :-) )


Favorite combo(s):

- @{"Female's Love Interest" link "STCCG:cotd100/COTD74"} + Firestorm + Cardassian Trap + any big time
  nasty like @{"Barclay's Disease" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD29"}. First hopefully get rid of Empathy (or a
  doctor / scientist) then hit with the trap to further decimate the crew
  and hope for the 75% chance you will have removed at least one of the
  three needed skills.

Hi, folks,

the last AU counterspell:


    @{b}KEVIN UXBRIDGE: CONVERGENCE@{ub}

    Interrupt, common AU.

Destroys all Event cards in play at any one spaceline location (including
those on ships).

@{i}"A Douwd, a race of sentient energy beings of 'disguises and false
surroundings'. He is capable of using his enormous powers to stop threats
with a single thought."@{ui}


The second variant of @{"Kevin" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}. One advantage, two disadvantages.

Advantage: He can eliminate more than one event card at a time. If they
are at the same location. Great for killing such nasty combos as Gaps in
Normal Space + @{"Subspace Warp Rift" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD83"} or two @{"Distortion Fields" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD99"}.

Disadvantage #1 (small): Cannot get rid of Artifacts played as events. So
no removing of that #?&%$ @{"Kurlan Naiskos" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD13"}.

Disadvantage #2 (really large): Can't get rid of all the global events.
And this includes all the really powerful ones. @{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"}, @{"Traveler" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD4"},
@{"Static Warp Bubble" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD48"}, @{"Anti-Time Anomaly" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD21"}, @{"Bynars Weapon Enhancement" link COTD197},
@{"Metaphasic and Nutational Shields" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD40"}, @{"Genetronic Replicator" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"}, @{"Revolving Door" link COTD168},
@{"Lower decks" link COTD188}, @{"Captain's Log" link COTD174}.

Also, unfortunately cannot kill a @{"Q-Net" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD86"}, which is on the spaceline, but
not as a location or on a location. It just goes "between two locations".

So what's the final deal? If you time it right, you can take out several
events with one card. Like a nasty combo plus two more on opponent's
ships or outpost. But these plays are quite rare, considering that for
speed, many players will not include more than 8 events in their decks.
And on the average, at least four of them are global:
@{"Red Alert" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD6"} and the @{"Traveler" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD4} are staples and almost everyone will have at
least one defensive Enhancer (@{"Replicator" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD46"} and/or @{"Shield Enhancer" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD40"}) in play.
And count on @{"SWB" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD48"}, @{"TAK" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD44"} or @{"Captain's Log" link COTD174}, too. So maybe four events that
go on the spaceline or a single ship. Maybe six, if you are very lucky.
With twelve locations in play, that gives you a good chance of not seeing
any two of them at the same location.

Take to this the problem that you might have an event at the same
location you'd rather not sacrifice you will soon return to using the
regular @{"Kevin" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD20"}. I definitely did.

BTW: Unlike @{"Countermanda" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD58"} this one is vulnerable to Q2. And before anyone
flames me: Countermanda has once (Warp pack release time) been ruled to
be considered an Amanda Rogers card, but the newer Colon Rule says the
contrary, so that one goes away with Amanda and not with Q2.

BTW2: Like the real Kevin he cannot stop instant effects of Events as
they always come into function for at least a fractional time unit. So
even the real Kevin cannot stop Yellow Alert from dispelling your
Red Alert.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #192@{ub}

Hi, folks,

nice to see some of you still care ("once in every five millenia ? >:-( " ?). Seriously, I try to maintain an average of at least 4.5 a week but
if you have to put in 18 hour workdays you sometimes get a little tired...

Anyway:


    @{b}MAMAN PICARD@{ub}

    Dilemma, space, uncommon AU.

If this is a Federation ship, immediately transport it to any end of the
spaceline (opponent's choice).

@{i}"At the place where ideas and reality intermix, Jean-Luc Picard saw his
mother Yvette Gessard Picard, who asked '(Is this) the end of the universe,
or... the beginning ?'"@{ui}


So finally we got a Feddie hoser. We already had the big Rommie-Killer
Firestorm, but now it's time to do something against the affiliation most
players deem the strongest one anyway. And this one is powerful.

The most important words on this Dilemma card are the ones that are not
on it, namely @{i}"Discard Dilemma"@{ui}. Yes, it just stays there and acts as a
big Feddie blocker. As long as you don't try with a non-aligned ship or
one of an affiliation you have a treaty with, a Fed crew just can't get
past this one.

The bad thing about it: It does nothing against the other affiliations.
Right: Nothing. So playing it is a little risky. But considering the
abundance of Fed decks especially in high level environments, it is often
worth using it even in your starting deck, but if you don't you should at
least have a few in your sideboard.

The other risk behind it: You might run into an opponent who has no space
missions. Like my Blue Lightning deck. But this can also be tolerated as
you will always have to count on decks like this. All space and all
planet strategies just are effective.

But I wouldn't be Wesley if I had not discovered a sneaky use with this
Dilemma. If you play Fed and intend to use WNOHGB or Lakanta, you can try
this play:

Use four planet missions and two space missions. All Fed only. The four
planets are the ones you want to solve and during seed you must see to
get a Space mission into the sixth or seventh slot. (If your opponent
also plays Fed, you can as well use her space missions for it). Place
your outpost near it (best next door), but not directly on. Now seed a
Maman Picard last under that mission.(ensure you have lots of Dilemmas so
you can seed last.) Once you have your WNOHGB or Lakanta you have an
instant, permanent teleporter that boosts your operating range by quite a
few cards! Whatever end your opponent chooses, the wraparound will get
you to where you want to be. Can you say speed advantage?

Good way to reach the outer positions in short time (esp. # 1/2/11/12).
Even better in multi-player or long spaceline games. Try it with a 120
card / 200 point / 12 mission each deck design and then you really
start gaining turns.


Favorite combo(s):

- Maman Picard + Lakanta or WNOHGB

@Node COTD193 "STCCG.guide/ST:CCG Card of the Day/Edo Vessel"

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #193@{ub}

Hi, folks,

still remember that old ep that almost got me killed? Justice?
If so, have a quick look at the

    @{b}EDO VESSEL@{ub}

    Ship, non-aligned, rare AU.

    Range 5
    Weapons 10
    Shields X

    Requires 0 command (*), 1 staff(+), 2 AU.

    X = 8, however, there is always a 50/50 chance any attack is nullified.

    AU Icon.

@{i}"A ship discovered in 2364 by the U.S.S. Enterprise to be protecting the
peaceful society on Rubicun III. It was described as 'half in, half out
of our universe.'"@{ui}

Husnock II. Really. Slow, big hitter and great on defense.
Only that it is a little more exaggerated. The range of 5 makes it the
slowest vessel in the entire game, but it does not lose so much compared
to a 6. The most probable two-mission span combination is 3-4 and both
ships can't make this in one turn.

Of course, the Edo Vessel also has trouble with 3-3. You could, though,
offset this by trying to select missions with a 2 span. But mind you -
you might be helping your opponent more than yourself! A 2 span mission
gives the Enterprise nice little 3-4-2 gaps to fly over in one turn. I'd
rather select a few 5-span missions slowing both sides as you're probably
not playing a speed deck with this ship anyway. Two 5's in a row
(preferably at your outpost) stop everything but the big AU ships. And
you get to move in and attack.

Which gets me to the Weapons rating. A 10 damages everything. Except a
Husnock. And you don't have that much to lose from getting damaged even
if you face a ship with weapons &gt;8. So the Edo vessel can be used as a
convenient trap. Have it sitting at your outpost, with several non-Fed
personnel waiting. If a ship comes your way, fire. It gets damaged. You
have the same range now, so whichever way it goes, you can follow and
finish it off. That'll teach them flying your way! And if the opposing
ship has weapons of 8 or less you can even repeat it.

And the shields? 8 is average for a big ship, but you have another
ability, usable only on defense. (If you attack, the special ability is
not useful). If something attacks you, flip the card and hope it comes
face down. If so, well it did not attack you. Period.

You do not get stopped or damaged. But you also may not fire back. Which
is not as bad as it sounds as
- you either get another chance if the attacker was some big ship except
  Husnock or Borg and your opponent wants to make an exchange - count on
  the next turn or attack yourself on your turn if you want to make the
  exchange
- or the opponent is a Husnock or Borg, both of which you cannot even
  scratch,
- or he would have been really stupid to attack you in the first place.

The staffing requirements? 2 AU is a little hard for a ship you'll want
to man with an affiliation able to attack, but not impossible. And the
one staff star is just a piece of cake.

End result: An improved Husnock. Good for a Klingon Armada deck pitted
against a fast deck. Like it.

Note: The calculations above are of course offset by the shield enhancers
and Bynars' Weapon Enhancement. But once the Nutational or Metaphasic shields
come into play, ship battle becomes futile anyway, unless you
attack with a big armada. And the Edo vessel @{b}is@{ub} a battleship.

Favorite combo(s):

- Edo vessel + Kurlan Naiskos + a well-seeded Borg ship: You are fast
enough, strong enough and cannot get hurt. Need I say 45 points?

Kevin Uxbridge:

  the only purpose of that event (so he can kill Kivas Fajo).

Maman Picard:
- they did not want the @{i}"If this is a Federation ship"@{ui} to be read as a

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #194@{ub}

Hi, folks,

where did I leave off yesterday ? Edo ? Comes handy, let's stay there.


    @{b}EDO PROBE@{ub}

    Dilemma, Space/Planet, uncommon AU.

Abandon mission attempt until any player has completed a different
mission OR continue but lose [10] points if you fail this turn.

@{i}"When the Federation tried to contact the pre-industrial society on
Rubicon III, the Edo probe demanded in ship-shuddering tones that
Jean-Luc Picard 'State the purpose!'"@{ui}


Another point sucker like The Higher... the Fewer. But a vastly different
one. Remember Sarjenka? That Dilemma that does nothing, but if you
choose to get stopped, you gain 5 points. This one is the negative. You
lose points if you get stopped. And if not - well, exactly nothing. But
this one has another catch.

You can just abandon the attempt and try something else first. Or wait
until your opponent has successfully done so.

The best place for an Edo probe is probably right in front of an
Outpost Raid - if you guessed right, that one is nearly impossible to pass
and the player will either have to seek greener grounds or suffer two losses
and 10 points on the wrong side of his account.

But you might already know I don't like point suckers that much, even
though the 10 points lost could mean the difference between having to do
three or four missions. And here, it will only work if somebody is
redshirting or has a less well staffed away team or crew in the first
place.

But like so often, cards have more than one use. Let's assume you know
your opponent often seeds a certain mission with a deadly Dilemma combo.
Like several Love Interests, followed by a Barclay's Disease or similar
nasties. And you cannot do anything once the Love Interests hit as they
don't stop you, so you must continue. How about seeding an Edo probe
yourself, after the opponent has put his first Dilemma (the big hitter
you'll see last) under that mission. That way, you can evaluate your
losses and take the option of not continuing with a critically weakened
crew. Thus, you have turned your Edo Probe into an
Emergency Transporter Armbands that won't clutter up your Draw deck.

Summary: Edo probe combines weakened versions of several cards (Sarjenka,
ETA, The Higher...) into one Dilemma. It is versatile, but not really
strong. I'd rather use the more purpose-oriented cards unless I have a
few slots left in my seed deck and want to keep my draw deck small, when
you might see a few of them as seeded ETA's. Unless I have a reliable way
of stopping my opponent, in which case the probe is better that
The Higher... (more points taken).


Favorite combo(s):

- Edo Probe thrown into deadly Dilemma combo headed my way. Close Call...

- (c) Movar: Edo Probe and Radioactive Garbage Scow. Hmm... Ouch!

- (c) Serge: Edo Probe + a single Rogue Borg... Let's do
             this six times!

[Unfortunately not involving any free Future Enterprises]

Hi, folks,

they let me back out. And I can even look at that card without falling
into fits. (They created a special version for me with a certain line
blanked out.) So what we have is a hologram with command ability, good for
redshirting (if you have @{"projector" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD77"}) like any holo and with two decent
skills. And good stats, too. One of the better uses is to have him fly
a runabout or medium size ship. Even if your entire crew gets disabled by
something nasty like a Ktarian Game, you can still get them somewhere
where you can find help instead of having to distract the able-bodied
personnel from their jobs until you can get the affected crew back. But in
the end he's, well only a holo. Neat for space mission decks, but not for
much more. Though he might be a basis for an all hologram deck. A handful
each of Einstein, Brahms, Rice and Jera, plus a F/R treaty, let's find
some missions for that deck. Investigate Disappearance, Repair mission,
Explore Black Cluster, Explore Typhone Expanse, Test Mission. That's five.
While we're at it, add some K'Teshs and the other treaties and we can now
solve Study Nebula, Survey mission, Investigate Shattered Space and
Study Stellar Collision and simplify the two "Explore..." missions above.
Hmm... do I smell a deck concept ?

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #196@{ub}

Hi, folks,

four days to the great Dream Card series... No make that three. I am in a
good mood, so I'll make up for the one I missed yesterday.


    @{b}RICHARD CASTILLO@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, uncommon AU.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 7
    Strength 7

    OFFICER, Leadership, Navigation, Command Star (*), AU Icon.

@{i}"Lieutenant and helm officer aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise-C. In 2366,
served as liaison with U.S.S. Enterprise-D. Romantically involved with
Tasha Yar."@{ui}


Okay, he's only uncommon and he looks quite handsome. But there is more
to a really good STCCG card. The big trouble with him is, he has a lot of
things you can get almost as good somewhere else, with something else
added to it. If you want it taken to the extreme, scratch the AU icon and
add Music, Diplomacy and Honor. You get a William Riker - he even has the
same attributes (8/7/7)!

What he definitely lacks is a really good skill. Navigation is okay, but
unless you have close to no bridge crew, you don't need it. And if you do
need some, add a McKnight or two which is common. Yes, attributes are
lower, but you can compensate for that (Lower Decks!).
Leadership is a little less common, but then you can build great decks
without Leadership. And the OFFICER classification also is nothing to
write home about. Too bad :-(

Everything he has is stuff I would consider a bonus in a personnel card
but not necessarily any reason to include the card in a deck. The only
thing he can serve well as is an Enterprise-C crewmember buried in a
well-placed Cryosatellite.

BTW: The exact same problem applies to Will Riker, a guy who has to stay
home in quite a few of my Federation speed decks. Even the three extra
skills don't always put him over the line unless I need lots of support
for the Leadership / Honor / Diplomacy combo.


Favorite combo(s):

- Nah. not really. I prefer good cards.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #197@{ub}

Hi, folks,

so here's the real one for today, after paying off my debts.
Check it out, we got a new rater - one I am just a little proud of. After
"only" 196 COTD articles, finally some official recognition has entered
this area of Cyberspace in the form of... Q!

To start this new era with something worthy:


    @{b}BYNARS WEAPON ENHANCEMENT@{ub}

    Event, rare.

    Plays on table. Bynars enhance each of your ship's WEAPONS +2
    (Cumulative.)

@{i}"Binary race closely integrated with computers. Always work in pairs.
Bynars have the ability to enhance specific computerized systems."@{ui}


(For those who wonder why I took a card from the basic set, this one was
a request)

Most of you will remember my frequent mention of the Klingon attack deck,
a style that has been discussed here at lengths already. For those who
don't, it mainly consists of K'Vort class ships (small and easy to fly)
with one pilot each and a complement of a few crew to solve a mission (or
just a Borg ship to destroy).

But the deck is only half complete without the cards you need to enhance
your ships. And I already discussed the other three ship enhancers,
Metaphasic and Nutational shields and the Captain's Log. But I'm still
missing the core card of any deck of this kind - Bynars Weapon Enhancement.

At first it seems innocent enough, just one +2 boost instead of the +2
for each Engineer or Science which sounds a lot more. But remember a good
attack deck needs to be able to destroy outposts and Borg Ships. To kill
an outpost, you need a fleet with total Weapons of 33. Using the log
alone, I can get the Pagh and the Hegh'ta to 10 Weapons each and add the
Vorn and the Buruk for a total of 13 more = 33. Nine cards. (4 ships, 4
pilots and the Captain's Log.) Now I add the Bynars and drop the Buruk
(and its pilot). Still 33 weapons. 8 cards. Let me add another Bynar and
drop the Captain's log, allowing me to draw any three pilots instead of
two very specific ones. Still 33 Weapons, still 8 cards. And better
flexibility. Now for the Borg ship. Unless I have solid shields of 12 or
better (which would require staffing my ships very well) I need to kill
it in one shot. So I need 48 weapons points. Add a fifth ship - any
K'Vort class ship - for 10 more points (at two Bynars). Total 43. Now I
need a sixth staffed ship or another Bynar. Each one will net me 10 more
points. Total 53. I lose my fleet but get 45 points. Which will be enough
to win. remember, my opponent has no outpost and no ships, so what is he
going to solve missions with? And a quick away team battle will just
teach him attempting to get that Iconian Gateway - or you just let him,
he won't likely make 45 with one mission and you can always be there for
the second. Or just use six male and female love interests each...


Favorite combo(s):

- Bynars + Bynars + Bynars + lotsa K'Vort class ships.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #198@{ub}

Hi, folks,

another small step towards the release of the Internet Expansion:
(readers under 18 years are courteously asked to skip this one :-) )


    @{b}JAMAHARON@{ub}

    Interrupt, common AU.

Nullifies Horga'hn OR nullifies Parallel Romance OR if planet Risa is on
spaceline, immediately move any one male personnel alone on a planet to Risa.

@{i}"A mysterious sexual ritual from Risa. One signifies desire for Jamaharon
by displaying a Horga'hn, as Jean-Luc Picard did accidentally in 2366,
thereby attracting Joval."@{ui}


Triple use... We had cards like this before. And they are at least
interesting.

The first use is one we have already seen on another card: The Devil. And
I cannot describe this feature better than by quoting that COTD:
@{i}"Removing a Horga'hn. This card is nasty and powerful and it cannot be
destroyed by normal means like Kevin or Amanda. Once your opponent gets
it and you cannot counter it, you can often concede the game. So here
[read: Jamaharon] makes sense. A definite tournament card as you won't
see many tourney decks without a Horga'hn."@{ui} (from issue 78, and yes I am
getting lazy :-) )

Second use: Nullify Parallel Romance. That one is a variant on the
Love interests. Instead of moving one crewmember, two are stopped. Which
helps a lot to get rid of a few personnel before striking with a real Dilemma.
But I don't like Dilemma nullifier cards that much, as they too much
depend on just one card being played and actually hit. (Even if the card
sees use, you still only have about a 50% chance of uncovering it during
a winning game and even less when not so fortunate).

Third: Move a single male to Risa if the latter is present. Hmm. For a
card I'd want to use on my opponent a few to many conditions. Although I
can put Risa on the line if I play Feds, I still need to rely on catching
a lone man. At least timing rules allow me a short window to play it if
my opponent tries to redshirt, namely the second between beam-down and
mission attempt. Playing it on myself is easier as I have total control
over how I move my personnel so if the starting location in question has
an outpost or an orbiting ship, I can beam personnel around to create @{i}"a
man alone"@{ui}. And then I can use this card as a Teleporter with a fixed
destination. Well, not too strong, though there may be situations in
which this might prove handy.

So the real question is: Which of the Horga'hn-killers should I use? I'd
rather prefer the two little surprise uses of Jamaharon to the somewhat
crappy side uses of the Devil. And Jamaharon is common whereas the Devil
is rare. So the first one wins.


Favorite combo(s):

- My Jamaharon + your Horga'hn. Shatter. :-)

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #199@{ub}

Hi, folks,

when doing the feature on Bynar weapon enhancement, I left one ship out
of the discussion of that Klingon attack deck I outlined. On purpose.


    @{b}I.K.C. K'RATAK@{ub}

    Ship, Klingon, common AU.

    Range 6
    Weapons 8
    Shields 6

    Requires 0 command (*), 1 Staff (+), 0 AU.
    Cloaking Device, Tractor Beam.

@{i}"Bird-of-Prey named in honor of the author of the classic work of Klingon
literature, The Dream of the Fire."@{ui}


The difference between this ship and all the other small K'Vorts is that
all others are more or less upgrades of the basic 8/6/6 scheme. Now this
one is slower but has much higher Weapons. Let's review this in the light
of the fact that all K'Vorts are most useful
- either in a Klingon attack deck
- or as quick and easy transportation for Klingons.
In the second aspect, this card obviously loses, as being two points
slower hurts. Really hurts. No questions.

For the first part: The magic numbers in a Klingon battle deck are 33
(outpost killer) and 48 (Borg ship direct hit.)

On outpost killing:
Some quick arithmetics show that I have nothing to gain from the K'Ratak
if I have exactly one Bynars in play. Every ship now has weapons of at
least 8, so I need four of which one must be a unique ship (Weapons =7+2
or 8+2). But the 7 is enough, so why bother?

If I have no Bynars, I need 5 ships (nothing above 8). There are three
with Weapons of 7, but this is a risky proposal as they are all unique
and I must draw all 3. So here having a fourth ship with weapons >6 can
be of some use. And with two Bynars it pretty much comes to the same.
Three times (6+4) leaves me 3 points shy, so I'd need some additional
power. But in all these cases, a Captain's log and the right pilot can
work the same wonders, too, as I need only 3 or less points. (Which means
one less card I need to draw).

More than 2 Bynars? Well, 3 of them gets me to >=36 with any 3 ships and
I don't see any way to do with only two ships unless I have the Log and
at least 4 Bynars.
(BTW: These calculations assume worst case - if your opponent plays Fed
you don't need 33 but only 31, and you can then pretty much take what you
want as long as you have one upgraded ship in your fleet.)

Now for the Borg ship:
Without Bynars I need 8 ships. Or seven, if I have all of the enhanced
ones out. And then I have lost my entire fleet. Bad move.
1 Bynar reduces the requirement to six ships or five when I have all four
of the enhanced ones. Again, many ships lost and the K'Ratak needs to be
there when I try to reduce the number.
2 Bynars: I am now at 40 with 4 ships. No way to gain 8 points (except
for Captain's Log), so stick with the fact you need five.
3 Bynars: 4 ships - any four - give me a 48. Enough.
4 Bynars: 3 ships + 6 more points are minimum, so K'Ratak plus Hegh'ta
plus Captain's log are required.
More than 4? What deck are you playing and where did you get those 15
boxes of STCCG?

So, from the weapons side, there is one conclusion: There are situations
where the K'Ratak helps. But there are also quite a few where it does
nothing helpful. And the big disadvantage? You can't keep your fleet
together anymore. All others fly at range 8. Only the K'Ratak crawls at
6. So you have to send it out in front of the others to arrive at the
same time. Or slow all other ships. And that is not what you want to do -
remember, you want to kill that outpost before everything is on the
table. Nah. Better stick with cards that don't hamper you that much.


Favorite combo(s):

- None. Can't even use a Captain's Log.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #200@{ub}

Hi, folks,

This is the day! And not a Captain's Holiday again (that one gets stale).
After scrambling through over 40 entries from 25 persons, I have finally
made some sense out of all the texts and picked the ten most interesting
cards (one from myself,nine from others). And to give the best chances to
everyone, I also restricted myself to one card for each person entering
something. So we have ten different authors for this nifty little ex-
pansion set. The question remained, where should I start. So I am going
in inverse ranking order, starting at 10th and going up to 1st. And the
ranking is not just mine but derived from the ratings I got in. And if
somebody gave a "coolness rating" besides the gameplay rating, I used the
former...

And here it comes...

Star Trek: Collectible Card Game
The Internet Expansion

Rank # 10, 557 points, Author: Isaac Garza.


    @{b}SPOT@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 4
    Strength 1

    ANIMAL, All attributes +2 if Data present, attribute numbers can be
    switched around at will.

@{i}"Spot is Lt. Cmdr Data's pet cat. After experiencing several or her
appearance changes, Enterprise-D crewmembers have openly speculated that
she might indeed be a shapeshifter."@{ui}


That flavor text just did it. Besides a funny special ability, this
variant of Spot (I got four different of these kitties) actually reflects
best the one(s) that was/were on the show :-) Now for the game value of
the card. Before delving into strategy we have to clarify a timing
issue. You have a special ability that is played as an action (Swapping
stats). You can use it whenever an action is legal and this means not
during any other action (as it does not mention an action during whose
course it may be used). So you can use the ability whenever an interrupt
is legal, which does not include
- in the midst of an away team battle,
- during Dilemma resolution,
- between two Dilemmas if the crew or away team is unstopped,
- between the last Dilemma and the mission evaluation if the crew is
  unstopped.

So basically you have to decide on Spot's stats before any Mission
attempt or battle. But you can interrupt your opponent's announcing of a
battle to sharpen a few claws...

What can you gain? A 6/4/1 is nothing to write home about, and in the
skill department little Spot is less than well-equipped. Even using the
Data bonus you only have an 8/6/3 personnel whose special ability makes
it a somewhat weakened 8/8/8 without any skills. And that is not much in
a game whose nots and bolts are skills. But Spot might still come in
handy as an attribute provider when facing things like Hologram ruse (she
smelled something wrong), Shaka (cats' natural understanding),
Malfunctioning door (claws like steel) or battles (did you ever have 20
claws and 10 pounds of fur in your face?).

Better than a phaser or PADD anyway, as you can also boost integrity and
the bonus can be employed more variably.


Favorite combo(s):

- Spot + Data + Parallel Romance. Now THAT's a couple for a romantic
  evening! (Even better than the one somebody recently mailed me - the
  first time he used the Romance he hit Wes and Beverly.)
