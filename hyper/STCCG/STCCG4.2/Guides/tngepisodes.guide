The main deflector dish has no effect on the Borg because, having assimilated
Picard and converted him into their spokesman, Locutus, the Borg know now
every strategy and contigency that Picard hd been informed of before his
kidnapping. Riker is promoted to Captain by Admiral Hanson, who then leads a
fleet of 40 starships to Wolf 359 to confront the Borg, but the fleet's
efforts are in vain - every starship is annihilated. Riker orders a cunning
attack consisting of awkward strategies that Picard would never have carried
out or expected, and an away team kidnaps Locutus and returns him to the
Enterprise. Data then links up to Locutus to access the Borg communication
network, but every approach he takes to disarm the Borg down fails until the
Borg arrive at Earth to begin their domination of the Federation. Data triggers
the Borg regeneration process, putting every Borg to "sleep", but this also
triggers the self-destruction of the Borg ship. Picard is freed from the Borg,
Shelby returns to Starfleet to rebuild the fleet, and Rikere remains on the
Enterprise to continue serving as first officer. However, staring out the
window of his ready room, Picard's face indicated that all is not well...

and B'Etor, the sisters of Duras, who offer his son Toral as an alternative
candidate for the throne. Picard, attempting to remain completely neutral in
order to avoid accusations that the Federation is taking a hand in Klingon
politics, denies Toral's challenge. Those, who would follow the family of
Duras, attack Gowron's ship as he and Worf discuss the redemption of Worf's
family honor. Worf's brother, Kurn, who now leads four squadrons of Klingon
ships, saves Gowron from the attackers, but the victory is only temporary.
With the revelation that Kurn is also a member of Worf's family, Gowron

matters to be dealt with only by the empire, without Federation interference.

anyway. After Worf departs, the Enterprise leaves the Klingon homeworld to
avoid any further involvement. But on the Klingon planet, in the quarters of

The forces of Duras are winning even after Gowron's fleet destroy all of
their possible supply bases. Picard plans to take starships to the
Romulan/Klingon border to act as a blockade against Romulan aid to the
Duras followers. Various Enterprise offficers are assigned to other ships,
most notably Data as captain of the starship Sutherland, whose first officer,
Hobson, objects to serving under an android commander. Commander Sela,
half-human, half-Romulan daughter of Tasha Yar, demands that the Federation
leave the border. Guinan reveals that Sela is the product of the Tasha Yar
who was sent to the Enterprise-C by Picard. Gowron launches a surprise attack
on their enemies. Lursa and B'Etor send a plea for aid. Sela tries to slip
past the Sutherland, but Data foils the plan and the Romulans are revealed
and forced to retreat, leaving Lursa and B'Etor helpless. They escape and
abandon Toral, leaving him to Gowron. Gowron offers Worf a chance to slay
Toral, but Worf chooses not to judge Toral by his father's actions and rejoins
the crew of the Enterprise. As later noted when they unexpectedly arrive at
Deep Space Nine, the Duras sisters are listed by the Klingon government as
renegades, but still remain at large with at least one ship of their own,
trying to raise capital for a second grab at the throne of the Klingon Empire.

and Jelad at Tenagra". Dathon vanishes and Picard is kidnapped via transporter.
Both are beamed to the planet, where Dathon attempts to communicate again.
Picard deciphers the language, finding that it is based on Tamarian folklore
and metaphors. "Darmok and Jelad at Tenagra" refers to two heroes who traveled
separately to a distand island, defeated a mighty beast, and left together.
El-Adrel is home to such a creature, and Dathon hopes that the Tamarians and
the Federation can begin a friendship by likewise defeating a common enemy.
When the beast attacks, Picard is immobilized by an attempt to rescue him
through interference projected from the Tamarian ship, while Dathon is mortally
wounded. Picard can now negotiate in the Tamarian language - if he survives
the creature's next attack.

Admiral Kennelly assigns the Enterprise to help resolve tensions with the
Bajorans, an isoltated, once-advanced race whose territory was long ago
taken by the Cardassians. Since then, the Bajorans have carried out terrorist
attacks on the Cardassians, and now, according to Kennelly, the Bajorans have
travelled outside their own system and attacked a Federation outpost. The
Enterprise is to contact the Bajoran terrorist leader Orta and offer serious
discussions after years of sympathetic talk and no action. Ensign Ro Laren,
herself a Bajoran - recently court-martialed but pulled out of prison by
Kennelly - is assigned to the Enterprise. Ro is an abrasive officer who does
not want to be on the ship or the mission. She does, however, tell Picard to
contact Keeve, leader of a Bajoran colony that has no technology and isn't
even able to adequately feed or cloth its own people. On another planet,
Picard contacts Orta - after being abducted by Orta's guards - and discovers
that the Bajorans do not have the resources to attack anything beyond their
own system. Ro then reveals to Picard that Kennelly is aware of this, and that
she and the Enterprise are being used by the Cardassians to quietly get rid of
the Bajoran "threat" by escorting them straight into the Cardassians's line
of fire.

gains Spock an audience with the Proconsul, Neral, who says he will endorse
reunification. Picard is sceptical, to the annoyance of Spock, who thinks
Picard's impression of him has been colored by Sarek. Neral is plotting with
Sela to invade Vulcan with stolen Vulcan ships in the guise of a peace envoy

to be delivered to the Neutral Zone border to Romulans for the invasion fleet.
Picard, Spock and Data are taken prisoner when betrayed by Pardek. Sela

of an engine explosion. An Enterprise away team beams aboard to assess the
damage, but when Geordi and Ro try to return to the Enterprise with a piece
of Romulan equipment, they are apparently lost in a transporter malfunction,
and the rest of the crew assume they are dead. Geordi and Ro both awaken on
the Enterprise, but they cannot be heard or seen by anyone else on the ship,
and their bodies are able to simply pass through solid walls and doors due to
their molecules being "phased". While Ro attempts to come to terms with her
apparent death, Geordi discovers that he and Ro are leaving a trail detectable
by the ship's sensors. The two try to alert the Enterprise crew of their
predictament, and discover that the Romulans can intentionally phase themselves
and are nearing the conclusion of a plan to destroy the Enterprise.

An excavation team on Earth summons the Enterprise to Earth, claiming to have
found evidence of extraterestrial visitors to the planet in the 19th century.
Picard and Data are shown an astonishing artifact unearthed near Starfleet
Academy: the head of Data, although he - with his head intact - is still
serving on the Enterprise. As Data contemplates the news, Geordi traces a
micro-organism discovered in fossilized form near Data's Head to the planet
Devidia II. The Enterprise heads for that world immediately, where an away
team beams down without Data, who believes the others are overreacting to his
impending fate. Troi senses life on the planet, although no beings are
visible.  Data, whose head contains a component that could allow him to see
the invisible life lorms, beams down and phases into the beings' plane,
reporting many large humanoid beings and an alien of some sort. Data is then
snatched through time - to San Franscisco in the late 1800s. He immediately
begins making preparations to continue the exploration he was conducting on
Devidia II after winning big in a local poker game. Elsewhere in the city,
two humans - or at least aliens in the guise of humans - patrol the streets,
finding a beggar and using a camouflaged device to steal the energy from his
body, killing him. Meanwhile, Picard readies another away team when Guinan
gives him cryptice advice, telling him he must join the away team. Data, in
the 19th century, discovers that Guinan is on Earth in the same time period,
though centuries before she met any of the Enterprise crew. Also present at
the social function where Data finds Guinan is one Samuel Clemens, better
known as Mark Twain, who overhears Data and Guinan discussing Data's real
origins. On Devidia II, the away team replicates Data's experiment and they
see the same life forms. Two beings arrive from a temporal rift, unloading
more energy for their fellow aliens to feed on - energy taken from humans on
Earth at the moment of death, acccording to Troi's empathic sense. Picard,
Riker, Troi , Geordi and Dr. Crusher enter the gateway, which closes behind
them as they travel back in time to search for Data and find out why alien
beings are interferring with human history.

After Picard and the away team manage to find indigenios clothes and lodging,
they begin a task which Data, separately, has pursued since arriving -
attempting to track down the aliens. They find a couple, disguised as a
doctor and nurse, who have been stealing energy and escaping unnoticed, and
the deaths then are attributed to a cholera epidemic of the period. In the
meantime, Data has enlisted the help of Guinan, but has run into some
unwelcome curiosity from Samuel Clemens, who trails both Data and Guinan
assuming that they've arrived from the future with evil intentions. Picard's
away team captures the key to the aliens' neural energy - gathering trips but
the aliens themselves escape - Picard's party is rescued from arrest by Data,
who then introduces Guinan to Picard for the first time in her life. They
then travel to the cavern where Data's head will be discovered in the 24th
century. followed by Clemens. As Clemens pulls a gun on the travellers, the
aliens return to retrieve their creature, but Data holds on to it, and one
of the aliens escapes through a temporal rift. The energy surge causes Data
to explode, and the alien nurse is left behind, dying. Riker, Crusher, Troi
and Geordi return to the 24th century, taking Data's decapitated body with
them - and again, they are followed by Clemens. Picard remains to make sure
Guinan is unharmed, while the crew, in the 24th century, tries to retrieve
Picard, send Clemens back to his native time, and stop further alien

stream between binary stars. A link between the two ships' transpoters must
be established so an away team can investigate the Yosemite, but Lt. Barclay,
assigned to the away team, reveals his life-long fear of transporting. Troi
convinces him to overcome his fear long enough to beam over to the Yosemite.
Beaming back to the Enterprise later, Barclay is sure he sees some kind of
creature in the transport beam approach and touch him. Fearing he has
contracted a psychosis caused by the transporter scrambling his brain, he
becomes so preoccupied that Troi relieves him of duty while Geordi and Data

While responding to a distress signal, the Enterprise encounters a Dyson
sphere, a colossal artifical structure whose habitable interior surface is
powered by a small star kept in the center of the sphere. The source of the
distress signal, a 75-year-old transport ship, is found crashed into the

when his ship crashed and no help was expected to arrive for quite some time,
used an innovative last-ditch transporter modification to suspend himself.
The occupant turns out to be Captain Montgomery Scott, chief engineer of the
original Enterprise. Scotty is welcomed aboard the modern Enterprise, but
soon finds that his skills and knowledge are of no use to Starfleet in the
24th century. In an attempt to make the uneasy visitor from the past feel

The Enterprise arrives at Tyrus 7A to observe a new experimental method of
mining, the particle fountain, which uses a stream of high-density particles
to extract and lift planet-based ore from an orbiting station. A malfunction
occurs while Geordi is visiting the station, and Dr. Farallon, the ambitious
head of the particle fountain project, introduces her other innovation, a
small repair robot called an exo-comp, which is able to correct the problems
almost instantly. Later, while Data is visiting the station, another accident
happens and Data notices an exo-comp exhibiting a will to survive. Data
hypothizes that the exo-comps are living beings with their own intelligence,
and possibly the beginnings of sentience. But when he asked to prove that the
exo-comps are alive, one of them appears to fail a test on the Enterprise,
but has actually realized that it is being tested and is therefore intelligent
and alive, though Dr. Farallon refuses to acknowledge the exo-comps' status.
A crisis strands Picard and Geordi on the station, endangered by rising
radiation levels, and Farallon proposes a solution which would amount to a
suicide mission for the exo-comps. When the crew prepares to implement the
solution and save Picard and Geordi, Data stands in the way of the rescue

When he goes to the Enterprise's stellar cartography department to ask why
their latest experiment is diverting power from nearly every system on the
ship, Picard meets Lt. Commander Daren, a new member of the crew who
intrigues him with her honesty and unpredictability. They begin to form a
relationship, and Picard worries that the rest of the crew might misinterpret
that relationship, interferring with his command. But depending on the
outcome of hazardous away team duty on Bersallis III, Picard and Daren may
not have long to explore what this new development in their lives mean.

Professor Galen, Picard's beloved archaeology professor from his days at
Starfleet Academy, comes aboard the Enterprise in an attempt to recruit
Picard for a private expedition, the conclusion of which Galen claims to
have profound implications for the entire galaxy. Picard regretfully turns
down Galen's offer, but later finds himself taking up the professor's work
when Galen's ship is unexpectedly attacked and destroyed. Following his
late mentor's vague leads and secretive trails, Picard takes the Enterprise
to distant worlds, attempting to piece the puzzle together. But it is
discovered that others - a great variety of others, at that - are also
attempting to finish Galen's work, and the end result could be a secret of
vast power.

divided by warring factions, are punctuated by feelings of paranoia he can't

The Enterprise arrives at the site of a recent attack on a Starbase, only to
find the Borg in orbit in a new class of vessel much larger than their
previously known forms of transport. The Borg have also changed, now
possessing some form of individuality and emotion - and they have also
developed a desire to simply kill organic life forms, not absorb them into
the Borg collective consciousness. A squadron of Borg attack an away team
from the Enterprise, and Data, in the process of fending off a Borg,
experiences an inexplicable flash of ruthless anger and kills the Borg. The
attacking party defeated, the away team returns to the Enterprise and Picard
contacts Starfleet. The new Borg pose an unknwon but likely more serious
threat than ever before to the Federation. After determining the new Borg
ship's method of propulsion, the Enterprise follows and is attacked once
again. Meanwhile, Data has yet to make any further progress in his analysis
of his first emotion - but a captured Borg makes Data a seductive offer to
experience more emotions... and it turns out to be an offer Data cannot resist.

A routine test of Worf's new photon torpedo guidance system sends a
potentially hazardous torpedo astray into deep space, which Picard and
Data set off to recover via shuttlecraft. When they return from their
mission, they find that every inhabitant of the ship has somehow mutated
into more primitive forms of life, some dangerous, others not. The cause
of this condition is a virus which has now infected Picard, leaving him and
Data very little time to reverse the plight of the crew.

Wesley Crusher, on a sabbatical from Starfleet Academy, has returnd to the
Enterprise in an attempt to recoup his energies in time to graduate. He is
troubled by something which he has yet to reveal to anyone, but more pressing
matters are on the mind of Picard and the crew as Starfleet orders the
Enterprise to evacuate or otherwise remove a colony of Native American Indians
who have settle on an isolated planet to preserve their culture. This planet
is now due to be handed over to the Cardassians according to the terms of a
treaty which realigns the borders of Federation and Cardassian space, and the
Indian colonists will no longer be welcome. Tired of their history of being
displaced by territorial bureaucracy, the Indians of Dorvin V decide to
reshape the borders themselves to protect what they hold sacred- and they
find a sympathizer in Wesley, who jeopardizes his Starfleet career to help
them and learn more about them.

As Alexander nears the age where he must decide whether or not to become a
warrior, Worf grows worried that the boy will choose to shed all vestiges of
Klingon heritage. Visiting a Klingon outpost during a festival, Worf and
Alexander are cornered by a gang of street thugs. As Worf manages to fight
most of them off, the fight is ended by a Klingon who calls himself K'mtar,
a bodyguard appointed by Worf's brother Kurn. K'mtar reveals that the attack
was not random, but an assassination attempt planed by Lursa and B'Etor, who
are still scheming to someday overthrow the Empire. With the help of K'mtar,
and some gossip courtesy of Quark, the Enterprise sets off to track down the
Duras sisters when it becomes evident that someone is trying to tamper with
future affairs.

Picard receives a threat from his old Ferengi adversary DaiMon Bok, who still
blames Picard for the death of his son in the first encounter between the
Federation and the Ferengi. Bok announces his intent to kill Jason Vigo to
avenge his loss, and the threat disturbs Picard. After tracking Jason down,
Picard is stunned when genetic tests confirm that Jason is the son of Picard
and a woman from his past. Jason turns out to be a rebellious young man
with a record of misdemeanors involving theft and trespassing and a passion
for rock climbing. Bok continues to mysteriously get through the Enterprises's
defenses to threaten Jason's life, until he finally kidnaps Jason and has his
opportunity for vengeance.

While rehearsing a scene from "The Tempest" in the holodeck, Data and Picard
are amazed when they are nearly run over by the Orient Express, the famed
19th century locomotive whose itinerary never once included Prosper's island.
Investigation of this quirk is postponed by the Enterprise's sudden jump to
warp speed, and a fortuitous exit from warp just in time to avoid the ship's
destruction. When the crew concentrates the search to this problem, a strange
modification of the ship's circuitry is discovered, one which seems to be
tying many disparate systems together. When the ship's systems take measures
to protect the growing anomaly, the truth becomes clear - this is no accident,
but a new intelligence all its own taking from within the Enterprises's hull.

A reception for recent Starfleet Advanced Tactical Training graduate Ro Laren
is cut short when the Enterprise responds to a Cardassian ship's distress call.
Arriving on the scene, Picard and the crew discover that the Cardassians are
under attack by a flotilla of small vessels commanded by the renegade Maquis.
After chasing them off and assisting the Cardassians, the Enterprise receives
a visit from Admiral Nechayev, who delivers to Picard the message that
Starfleet intends to use Ro to infiltrate the Maquis, and she accepts the
mission, posing as an ex-Starfleet defector and gaining the acceptance of
the Maquis. However, when Ro and her "fellow" Maquis are the targets of a
vicious Cardassian sneak attack, she questions Starfleet's rationale for
stopping the Maquis and makes her defection a reality.
