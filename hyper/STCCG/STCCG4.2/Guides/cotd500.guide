        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #401@{ub}


Hi, folks,

new year (well, a few days ago), new 100-set of COTDs, new expansion? Oh
what the... - why not.


    @{b}RETASK@{ub}

    Event, rare FC.

Downloads [universal] Borg Cube and seven drones. ( [Borg] x3, [Comm]x1,
[Nav] x2, [Def] x1) to replace any Borg Ship Dilemma in play. Discard Event
and Dilemma. Draw no cards this turn. [Borg use only]

@{i}"Even a Borg cube ship can lose contact with the collective and begin
marauding through space. Proper protocol re-establishment reintegrates it
into the collective."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE card. For the cost of just one measly card, you get not three, not five,
not seven but eight cards from your draw deck. And you get to play them all
right away. And what's more, you get to choose them. No hoping for that
Interlink drone or the Range enhancer drone. No, you get them all right
away. A @{"Betazoid Gift box" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD264"} on steroids. Or is it? A card that powerful must
have a drawback somewhere. More often than not, this drawback in the end
kills the card. Here as well? Let's have a look.

First you need a @{"Borg Ship Dilemma" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD240"} in play. That means someone must seed it.
As you can't rely on your opponent being that friendly, you'd better do that
yourself. And while we're at it, you should also be able to trigger the @{"Borg" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD240"}
@{"Ship" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD240"} yourself just in case that person on the other side has no intention of
doing you the favor of attempting the mission you seeded the @{"Borg ship" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD240"} at.
So, maybe a Scout ship and a green drone would also make a good addition to
a retask situation. Oh, and while we're at it, add an Establish Gateway
objective, after all, you want to scout the location to trigger the @{"Borg" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD240"}
@{"Ship" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD240"}. That makes your investment a bit higher, of course, four draw cards
and one seed card (Or three draw and two seed). Eight for five is however
still better than a @{"Kivas" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD49"}. Especially as you do have the choice of those
cards and you thus get to very selectively thin your deck and you also get
to play the cards right away. So still a good investment.

But like every profitable investment this comes with a sizable risk. One
measly @{"Uxbridge" link "STCCG:cotd400.guide/COTD303"} can spoil your entire plan. Of course you could draw some
profit from the Ux by revealing a number of "The Line Must Be Drawn Here".
But to be worth the expense of five cards, you'd need to make at least a
20-25 point profit off the card. And as Trelane already noticed on the BBS,
this costs you 4-5 seeds. Seeds that could be Maglocks, @{"Yutas" link "STCCG:cotd400.guide/COTD308"} or - @{"Borg" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD240"}
@{"Ships" link "STCCG:cotd300.guide/COTD240"}. Or you can use Q2 to overcome the Ux - a Q2 you need to draw and of
course with the Q2 you are exposing yourself to the Line, a fate that is
even worse to the Borg whose scoring possibilities are pretty low-point so
that a few negatives might hurt twice as much. Of course if the Ux hits, you
might have lost five cards for nothing.

So, yes, Retask is powerful. Maybe in sheer and raw power the most powerful
STCCG card we've seen yet. But it's balanced by the significant risk you are
taking to get it to float. Your best hope is to stock a high number of
Retasks (@{"Palors" link "STCCG:cotd400.guide/COTD316"} don't work very well if your opponent has the Kivas Fajo
personnel card) and hope to get one to float (stock Mirror Image to make
parallel use of his @{"Kivases" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD49"} if he has one - you won't want a card
disadvantage in a deck relying on the power of a successfully executed
Retask.)

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #402@{ub}


Hi Folks,

no comments on lags this time except this: "First Contact Demo Tour" ;-)

Okay, now that I set this aside, here's the card:


    @{b}READY ROOM DOOR@{ub}

    Doorway, uncommon FC.

Once per turn, plays to download to one of your ships its
matching commander (draw no cards this turn) OR to download one
Captain's Order (Captain's Log, Lower Decks, Yellow Alert,
Senior Staff Meeting or any card so marked). After use, discard
doorway; place it atop your draw deck; or place it atop one of
your Captain's Order events to protect that event from
nullification.

Sounds harmless enough, but is possibly the most broken card Decipher
ever released for STCCG. And the key to breaking it is in that harmless
"...place it atop your draw deck". This means you can use the Ready
Room Door an infinite number of times and thus can completely choose
whatever you want to get from your deck as long as it can be
retrieved with the Ready Room Door. And through cascaded downloads,
this list is quite long. Via Assign Mission Specialists you can use
the Door to download any two mission specialists - which is the key
to the infamous AMSQ deck. To win with this deck, you just need two
mission specialists and a Ready Room Door in your opening hand (plus
a ship or tent). You get 2 mission specialists right away in the seed
phase from your first AMS. Turn 1 and 2: Discard AMS, Play a mission
specialist, Play Ready Room Door, download AMS, use it to download
two mission specialists. On turn 1, you replace the door on the top of
your deck, on turn 2, you can also replace it (which would be a good
idea if your opponent is using a Q-Flash) or just discard it. On turn
2, solve your outpost mission using a self-seeded Q to nullify all
Dilemmas. On turn 3, play a ship and solve two more missions. But
you can do basically the same deck without Q - just spend 3 or 4 turns
assembling the greatest crew in the Galaxy and then go off solving
missions at leisure. Now all this would be much harder if you needed
to have a Ready Room Door for each download, but through the eternal
recycling of the Door, you can thin your deck so far by just grabbing
mission specialists that the few cards left after you're done with
the Ready Room Door (use it for a Lower Decks or Yellow Alert on the
last time around) will always be exactly what you need.
Defense against this thing ? Not many. Subspace Schisms can break the
cycle by killing off the Door when it is redrawn after the first use.
Mission Debriefing can make the AMSQ deck one or two turns slower.
And if you're lucky, you might get an Anti-Time-Anomaly out against the
AMSQ player early enough that he can't complete all his missions before
it goes off. But that's guesswork.
Oh, and here's a dream card to illustrate how bad a Ready Room Door is:

    @{b}WONDERBOY@{ub}

    Personnel, Fed, universal.

Select two classifications and two skills when reporting.
Fulfills the requirement for one command and one staff star. Does not
count as your card play. Whenever you report Wonderboy, you may look
through your deck and place a Wonderboy on top.
INTEGRITY 15
CUNNING 14
STRENGTH 11.

Sound familiar ? No ? But this is the net effect of a Ready Room Door
played with Assign Mission Specialists. Seems a tad bit powerful to me...

Favorite combo(s):

- No, no, no. Decipher, please put a fix on this card.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #403@{ub}


Hi, folks,

greetings from Italy ;-) A change of plans from the side of my employer
forced me to change my plans as well... A change of plans ? Why not...


    @{b}A CHANGE OF PLANS@{ub}

    Interrupt, common FC

    Borg use only.

Plays to do any or all of the following: discard your current objective;
return it to your hand if you have Borg Queen in play; and download one
Objective card.

@{i}"Sensing that her plans for the interplexing beacon had been thwarted,
the Borg Queen immediately implemented a new goal for the hive."@{ui}

A must have for the Borg. As you can only have one Objective in play at a
time, you can easily run into a situation where you cannot get to complete
it. A simple Maglock can stop you from establishing a Gateway if you have
neither Locutus, a Queen or an assimilated OFFICER. And without an Objective
that lets you battle, you would never be able to do anything constructive.
Thus, it's urgent time to change your plans. And there's only one way to do
that.
Three functions, two of which you can use simultaneously.
Discarding your Objective or returning it to your hand is the first part of
the card. Getting rid of an Objective you don't want is vital. Of course
this means wasted resources as you will probably already have lost personnel
or other cards in the attempt. So you will often want to have the objective
back once you've completed the more urgent task at hand, thus you'll like to
get the card back, so a Queen isn't the worst thing to have ;-)
The other function is to download any one Objective. This is a doubly vital
function, first you get exactly the Objective you want and second it doesn't
count as your card play, speeding up your game by one card play.
So far pretty basic, eh ?
Thought so... Here's a hint or two you can use to very effectively change
some plans in order to thwart your opponent's plans. Want to have a constant
license to invade his ships and battle and assimilate his crew ? Nothing
easier than that.
Get an Assimilate Counterpart card, play it, target whatever unique male
you want, beam over, attack. As soon as you've abducted your target, change
your plans (after you've surely assimilated a few vital personnel of your
opponent) and the very next turn (or if you have some crew left, even on the
same turn), beam over some more Borg to battle and eliminate (or assimilate)
some more of your opponent's personnel. In a recent game, my opponent got
truly frustrated after a fourfold recycled Assimilate Counterpart got ten of
his fourteen personnel on my side, six asimilated and four abducted... He
had a full three people left in his deck. And with no way to get them
back ;-)
Or of course, trick your opponent. Plop down an Asimilate Planet. Start
scouting. He'll sure try to get his mission before you can probe. Change
your plans, Eliminate Starship, BOOM ;-)
And if you think your A Change of Plans cards dilute your deck:
You can easily stock one per Objective. Each A Change gets an Objective out
of your deck, without a card draw wasted. Plus you get a free card play. So
this card (and the Awaken card) are truly free deck filters plus they save
you card plays and help you speed your Borg deck. So feel free to stock them
in rather liberal amounts ;-)

Favorite combo(s):

- Assimilate Counterpart + multiple A Change of Plans

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #404@{ub}


Hi, folks,

no intro today. Let's jump right into it as if I had come from the Delta
Quadrant through some mysterious hole in space...


    @{b}TRANSWARP NETWORK GATEWAY@{ub}

    Doorway, common, First Contact, Borg Use Only.

Seed one during outpost phase on any spaceline end OR play on any
spaceline location where you have a [Nav] Borg. Any player may play
a Transwarp Conduit (or another copy of this doorway) to move any
or all of that player's ships from this Transwarp Network Gateway
to another. OR downloads Transwarp Conduit (discard doorway).


A pretty basic card for the Borg, but is it vital ? The function of
the card is to quickly get your Borg from one location to another,
especially from the Delta Quadrant to the Spaceline. But then,
there is the question whether you really need it. Okay, you *do*
need two - the one at the spaceline end and the one at your
Outpost. You will also need one for each Establish Gateway
Objective you want to complete as the Gateway download there is
mandatory and if you cannot fulfil it, you will give your opponent
the chance to study your strategy. But this is about where the
usefulness of the TNG ends. Actually *using* it to trigger the
movement makes little sense as you can use the Transwarp Conduit
just as well and the Conduit is just as effective without the
Gateways by doubling your RANGE and thus getting halfway across the
spaceline anyway. (A Caveat: You might want to have *one* Gateway
for movement in your tent in case you run into an Amanda-happy
opponent to make sure you get your cube to the spaceline. Download
it with the Transwarp Drone if you need it.)
So the best strategy for establishing a Transwarp Network is:
(1) Seed one TNG at the end of the spaceline.
(2) Play Awaken to get a Transwarp Drone to your Outpost, download
    the TNG for the Outpost using the Outpost ability.
(3) Report a Scout to the un-TNGed end of the spaceline,
    downloading a Gateway there as well.
    You will often be able to have all three done by the end of the
    first turn.
(4) Download another Gateway using the drone as soon as you have a
    staffed cube at your Outpost. Play it to move to the Alpha
    Quadrant.
(5) You can now report drones to your cube and move around between
    your established Gateways using Transwarp *Conduits*. If you really
    want to build another cube at your outpost, just repeat the process
    (4) (using a Gateway you download if your opponent Amandas the
    Conduit even if that means risking a look through your deck in a
    very late game stage - still better than having useless (Hi Mot!)
    cards in your deck.)
In the end the TNG works a lot like an Outpost card - you seed it
as routine but you don't want to draw one in the actual game unless
there are special circumstances.

Favorite combo(s):

- Transwarp Network Gateway (seeded and played early) plus a
  handful of Transwarp Conduits.

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Card of the day@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #405@{ub}


Hi, folks,

still remember me ? ;-) Good. Here's something more for you deprived
addicts:


    @{b}ZEFRAM COCHRANE@{ub}

    Personnel, non-aligned, rare FC.

    Integrity 5
    Cunning 8
    Strength 6

    CIVILIAN, ENGINEER x2, Computer Skill, Astrophysics, May play Visit
    Cochrane Memorial on same planet. Command Star (*), AU Icon, OCD Icon.

@{i}"Inventor of Warp Drive. Reluctant Hero. First human to make contact
with an alien species. Likes tequila, rock'n'roll, money and naked
women."@{ui}


This card just calls for a Devidian Door or three in your deck if you
want to do anything with the Cochrane Memorial. Zefram is a Human
ENGINEER, you may  play the memorial wherever he is present on a planet
and as you need the ENGINEER to be unopposed for the Memorial to work
you can send Zef to the most remote corner of the Galaxy where he can
safely stay and admire his own memorial in order to speed up your
game... Plus, you get a 6th mission to solve and don't need to bother
with Earth (a planet that incurs a significant risk if your opponent
gets the nasty idea of playing a Borg Deck).
But of course Zefram can do more than just aaah and oooh at his own
memorial. He also creates a viable alternative to a certain female
CIVILIAN/ENGINEER (Kareen Brianon who has the added Youth but lacks the
Astrophysics and second ENG) who is occasionally seen in Naiskos decks
for her classification combination and his AU icon helps to do this
trick with a cryo crew. While it may occasionally be more desirable to
go for Kareen if you want to play without the AU door or are desperately
short on females, Zefram will often better supplement your decks with an
ENGINEER theme due to his doubled ENGINEER (think Repair Mission and
Dyson Sphere!) and the Astrophysics he adds to the equation. For real
fun run into a Military Privilege, give Zefram an Engineering Kit and
send him off to repair the Argus array all by himself (well almost, he
of course needs to be supervised by Mot the Barber to ensure he repairs
the array instead of just draining the bar of any drinkable content)
And then there is the theme deck department. Not that I've ever seen a
Montana Missile Complex in play yet, but miracles might happen someday.
Zefram is vital to retrieve and staff the Phoenix if a MMC ever enters
play and those are ten pretty easy points to get. (BTW Major - can you
play Visit Cochrane Memorial on the MMC ? I'd say yes, but I'd like that
confirmed - if you can, this would of course be the safest location to
get him to)
Not much else - the attributes are pretty solid (though the 8 CUNNING
seems a tad low for an inventor of a level comparable to Dr. Soong) and
he is immune to the more popular attribute-based killers Hunter Gangs
and Firestorm.
Not a card for every deck (but which personnel is ?) but definitely a
great addition to a few creative strategies.


Favorite combo(s):

- Zefram Cochrane aaahing and oooohing at his own memorial
