  @{b}Star Trek: A Klingon Challenge@{ub}


from Decipher:

Now that Blaze of Glory has been released, we're getting
tons of questions about the set. People have questions about
card combos, questions about rulings, questions about deck
designs... but the it seems the main question is "What is A
Klingon Challenge?"

In the upper right corner of each and every Star Trek CCG
card is a phrase that indicates the source of the card's
image. Two cards from Blaze of Glory, Kavok and Commandeer
Ship, bear the logo: "Star Trek - A Klingon Challenge."

This is not a misprint, easter egg, or preview of an
upcoming Star Trek project. The images on those cards are
taken from a VCR Interactive Game produced by Decipher
several years ago, before even the CCG was created.

The game stars actor Robert O'Reilly (better known to most
Star Trek fans as Gowron) as Kavok, a Klingon who hijacks
the Enterprise. Original footage was shot specifically for
the game with the consent and assistance of Paramount. Now
we have taken two of these images and added them to the Star
Trek CCG universe.

Those who have played the VCR Game can now relive the
excitement of that storyline, and all our CCG players enjoy
the benefits of a powerful new game mechanic.
