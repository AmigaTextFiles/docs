        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #301@{ub}


Hi, folks,

now that the #300 hype is over (did ya like it?) I can take my time to
get at those cards that pose a little more difficulty evaluating. Namely
the two QC doorways. (For those of you yelling "It's Classic time" - I
am in a serious shortage of ratings and most raters obviously didn't
even see the request at the bottom of #300 part 2, so I'll present these
two without ratings and resume the Classics with #303...)

Here's the first:


    @{b}Q'S TENT@{ub}

    Doorway, common QC.

Place one atop Q's Tent side deck (up to 13 different cards) during the
seed phase. Q'S Tent is now open and in play. OR Stock in deck and use
as follows: Once per turn, play to take a card from tent into your hand,
either your choice (discard doorway) or random selection (place doorway
on top of your draw deck). Must show card to opponent. Draw no cards
this turn.


Probably the greatest new idea since STCCG's basic set, side decks add an
entirely new level of complexity to this game. Remember that I already
talked about quite a number of cards with the general direction being
"Yeah, it is great, but unfortunately your opponent has to play a
[variable part] and you just can't rely on that" ? And this class of
cards are prime candidates for a Q's Tent. Add an assortment of all 3
Incoming Messages and you'll always have the right one in your hand.
But this is only half the use of a Q's Tent. There is another class of
cards: Those you'd rather like to have early in the game (Red Alert,
The Traveler) or prefer to see after some building up has taken place
(Anti-Time Anomaly, Supernova, Distortion of Space-Time Continuum).
For the discussion, let's assume you want to play a deck with all five
of these cards. Without the Tent, you draw seven cards (including the
Supernova, and the ATA) and start waiting for your Red Alert. Which
comes up second last card in your draw deck.
Now let's put the five cards into the tent instead. You now draw two
Q's Tent instead of the Nova and the ATA. Two Doorways you can as well
exchange for a Traveler and a Red Alert (discarding them). Bingo. And
when you later draw more tents, you get your Nova or whatever. Almost
as good as stocking your deck.
But nothing comes without a price: Each Q's tent card costs you two card
draws, one to draw the Doorway and one more as you lose that turn's
draw.
And if you have the Traveler out, you even lose three cards for the one
you retrieved (you draw *no cards*, not *one less* card). So don't
exaggerate the Tentmania. If you put 13 important cards from your main
deck into the Tent and replace them with 13 Tents, you'll never get to
draw normally. Unless of course, you have an unbeatable strategy that
relies on only 13 cards drawn in a certain order. In this case play a
draw deck of nothing but Q'S Tent and you'll always get your combos.
But the regular play style will be about 4-5 tents in your draw deck
with a similar number of vital cards in the tent. The rest will then be
specific cards like Incoming Messages or the Devil. If you have room, you
can also stock a Dilemma or two and retrieve them for free when a Q's planet
is played.
And just so you get an impression, I made a tent for The Wrath of Wesley
(deck listing available on the Decipher site under Cool Stuff - Decks).
Number of tents in draw deck: 5.
Cards taken out of the deck: Red Alert, The Traveler, Destroy Garbage Scow,
Goddess of Empathy, Distortion of S/T continuum. These five go into the tent
(2 early-game cards, 3 late-game cards!)
Add the following:
Incoming Message - Fed
Incoming Message - Kli
Incoming Message - Rom (3 cards to annoy opponent)
Full Planet Scan (in case I'm short on crew)
Soong-Type Android (also just in that case...)
Yellow Alert (In case my hand runs low on cards)
Gibson (for my hidden mission)
Mordock (in case I draw 3 doorways early - extra points)
13 cards and you'll most probably agree that depending on the way the
game runs you'd only want to see a few of them at any certain time.
A last tip: Always retrieve by choice unless you make a crew tent (place
your entire crew in the tent and start drawing them one by one, regardless
of the order. Add a few tents and lots of nasty events and interrupts to
your draw deck. Might work in a stall deck, too slow for everything else.
And when you reread older COTDs and stumble upon the word "sideboard",
this should read "Q's tent" now...

Favorite combo(s):

- Q's tent + 13 good cards ;-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #302@{ub}


Hi, folks,

I don't really know why I'm still around after Tebok has discovered the
unbeatable deck (I had a similar idea, though mine was not as focused),
and I discovered the deck to beat it (and it's just as boring :-( ).
After all, we might as well now ditch most of our cards...

But not this one which plays a role in both of them:


    @{b}Q-FLASH@{ub}

    Doorway, common QC.

Place one atop Q-Continuum side deck during the seed phase. Q-Continuum
is now open and in play. OR seed under any mission like a dilemma. Any
crew or Away Team encountering this Q-Flash must experience X cards from
opponent's Q-Continuum, where X= the number of personnel present. OR
Stock in deck and play to nullify one [Q] icon card.


Not just a card, but a concept. Until now we had Dilemmas. They had one
thing in common (except for The Higher... which was just a penalty):
The more personnel you had present the less they did to you. Now this
is the exact opposite: The more personnel you have present, the bigger
the OUCH you're gonna take. So the old strategy of "I take what I
have and throw it at the problems" has just experienced a nasty counter.
The card in itself has little use. It marks something. Great. Only the
third use (nullify one [Q] card) is something it can do by itself.
And this function is usually much better performed by a Kevin, an
Amanda or a Q2, cards that are more versatile than a nullifier for
Q-cards only. But there's a little extra power I'll touch later which
might make it sensible to use the flash for this purpose anyway...
So the true power is not in the card itself (yeah, we had this before:
AU doorway) but in the options it presents. And thus there should be a
little review about Q-Continuum cards in general before I pick out some
of them for closer examination.
Most Q-cards don't do much just by themselves. They have a minor nuisance
effect, can be overcome or fizzle entirely because some required condition
just cannot be met (e.g. Dr. Q or Wesley gets the Point). But they don't
count as a card. They count as 1 Xth of a card. After all, for the price
of one seed card, your opponent is going to hit X Q-cards which count
nowhere, not for your 60-card limit, not for seed card percentage, not
for anything else. Except for the size of your binder ;-)
So think BIG when seeding a Q-Continuum. 8 to 12 cards for each Flash you
want to seed is a good start. And remember duplicates are discarded, so
seed enough different cards. Maybe these figures will help you:

# of flashes    #Q-cards: Total   Different # copies of each card
1                          8-12    6-12     1 - 2
2                         16-24    9-18     1 - 3
3                         24-36   12-21     1 - 3
4                         32-48   15-24     1 - 4
5                         32-60   15-26     2 - 4
6                         32-72   15-28     2 - 5

Note that the minima do not increase after 4 flashes, as even with a Q's
planet somewhere your opponent will rarely have to attempt more than 4
missions.
Some Q-cards also have a weakness: "Until any Q-Flash". This means you
will have to be judicious about the use of this card when you want to
keep them in play or get rid of them. If the former, make sure you have
several of them in your continuum so that every new flash will also
trigger a new copy of the card (even to the point of exceeding the
maxima above). If you'd rather get rid of the cards, you have several
possibilities:
- Redshirt a mission under which you suspect a Q-Flash
- Nullify them
- Nullify any Q-card that has *no* "until any Q-Flash" on it. The ones
  with that designation will follow and you get several cards for one.
Last thing: A cute bluff. Build a huge Q-Continuum. About 60 cards.
Then, seed no Q-Flashes. But hefty Dilemmas instead. Your opponent will
go in with minimum crew fearing your Q-Flashes. Which means he'll go
out with no crew at all ;-)


Favorite combo(s):

- Didn't experiment with this enough to put anything really great here.


No ratinx today (again), I have received a few but I'll stick to what
I said; it might have discouraged a few raters from sending something
and I don't want to be unfair here. But anything I received was really
high.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #303@{ub}


Hi, folks,

we had so much QC hype that we almost forgot there remain a few cards to be
done on this sector:

    CLASSIC COTD #20


    @{b}KEVIN UXBRIDGE@{ub}

    Event, uncommon.

Destroys any one Event card in play (except for Treaty cards) OR any one
artifact in play as an Event card.

@{i}"Immortal omnipotent being called a Douwd. Lived secretly as a human. Took a
human wife who was killed by the Husnocks at Delta Rana IV."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some rater called it "The God Card". And yes, it is one of those cards that
no deck seems to be without. (Well, at least no decks that don't exclusively
rely on Parallax Arguers ;-) )

There are so many powerful events in STCCG that countering some of them has
become a necessity to most players. And as with many counter-cards,
estimating their power means taking a look at what it can counter (this time
in order of priority, most urgent ones first)

   * 1: Red Alert! This is the instant Kevin-sucker. However before you
     nullify this one, ask yourself a question? Did your opponent already
     use the potential or is there something to come?
     If you can get rid of it before any personnel cards have been played
     you have half won. If you are less lucky, only kill it when your
     opponent does have some extra card drawing power. Otherwise she won't
     play those cards because she can't draw them... Also hold back if you
     have already used your Red Alert and hold a Yellow Alert card - kill
     both Red Alerts and have fun!
   * 2: The Traveler: Transcendence. An extra card each turn is great. Too
     great to let your opponent have it. And besides, don't you want to play
     your Static Warp Bubble? (Don't forget you can kill your own Traveler
     if you need that one extra turn before exhausting your deck)
   * 3: Kivas Fajo - Collector. Another of these extra card draw
     possibilities. Three for one is a good trade... And preventing three
     for one is nearly as good.
   * 4: Supernova. Just too powerful to go through. But never try to counter
     the Tox Uthat. Why let her waste one card play if you can make her
     waste two?
   * 5: Genetronic Replicator. Hey, what do you think those Killer Dilemmas
     are for? Mission decoration?
   * 6: Klim Dokachim. Unless you have a Red Alert out in which case you can
     most probably stand the loss of your draw every 3 or 4 turns.
   * 7: Anti-Time Anomaly. Your opponent will have had a reason to play it,
     so you most probably have a reason to stop it. But don't forget there
     are several other evasion possibilities that don't waste your Kevin.
   * 8: Yellow Alert. Only if you hold a Red Alert and several crew
     though...
   * 9: Captain's Log and other Shield / Weapon enhancers. Best combined
     with Manheim's Dimensional Door to gain a surprise advantage in
     battle...
   * 10: Revolving Door. After all, you probably need your Doorways...
   * 11: Immortal again. After all, your opponent probably needs that
     Q-Continuum...
   * 12: Espionage cards. Right after they pass that last Dilemma and before
     checking mission requirements. Incredibly easy points for you...

Some less great ideas for nullifying:

   * 99: Static Warp Bubble. Come on, you have a Traveler. And you have an
     extra one in your Q's tent. You do, don't you?
   * 98: Q-Nets. What deck goes without 2 Diplomacy?
   * 97: Plasma Fire and Warp Core Breach: You should be able to get rid of
     these without wasting a card...
   * 96: Tox Uthat. Already said why.
   * 95: Barber Pole
   * 94: Mot's Advice

Now how about the number of Kevins in a deck? I usually have two or three,
sometimes even only one. But I make liberal use of Palor Toffs to get them
back just in case I need more. (And those Palors can mimic something else if
I need that more urgently). So don't overload your deck with Kevins. I've
seen early counterdecks relying on 6 Kevins and 4 Amandas. They were
incredibly effective at that time, when most people really relied on events.
But in modern STCCG, a good deck is one that can win if it never draws its
Red Alert, its Traveler or Genetronic Replicator. So you don't need that
many Event killers anymore. (And if you really do, see above Palor
comment...)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * a few Kevin Uxbridges + several Palor Toffs. Get them back if you need
   them. And if not, get something better.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #304@{ub}


Hi, folks,

today I am finally taking all my courage together and start those cards with
the black text boxes. Right, the ones with the cute little Q icons in the
top left corner. And which one would be a better starting place than the one
that caused the biggest controversy ?


    @{b}GIFT OF THE TORMENTOR@{ub}

    Q-Interrupt, common QC.

If your current score is zero, score bonus points. Otherwise, place this
card in your discard pile. (May be nullified only by Countermanda).

@{i}"We have offered you a gift beyond all other gifts."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The one card nobody understood. After all, why should I be giving my
opponent the win? And yet, you can use it for yourself. But, it is not easy
and you'll have to take some preparations (but then, 100 points without any
means for your opponent to defend against them are not that crappy). So
first, you'll have to prevent your opponent from scoring. Several of the
easy 5 point Dilemmas have been suggested, but I'd rather propose a much
safer and also more lucrative solution: The higher... the fewer. Your
opponent is definitely not going to have 0 points after that card. He might
have less, but that's life ;-)

Now you have a Gift of the Tormentor sitting in your opponent's discard
pile. And you'll have to get it from there. The clue is another common
Q-Interrupt - Are these truly your friends, brother? Feed your opponent's
discard pile to a certain point (draw out some interrupts) and then use
other cards to decimate his away teams so you get the effect of the card
while still having a good chance at drawing the right card. So much for
theory. And practically? You still need other ways to win or you won't win
many games but this combination will give you a shot at a really spectacular
win now and then. With good timing, you might pull it off once every three
to four games. So why not add these two to your Q-Continuum?

Side Note: Every now and then, you'll meet an opponent with good playing
skills. He'll seed an innocent Sarjenka somewhere and attempt the mission
afterwards with exactly five people in the away team, so The Higher... will
reduce his score to 0 and he now threatens to score big. So keep a
Countermanda in your deck if you plan on using this card combo to increase
your winning percentage. Or cure the risk by seeding Royale Casino: Craps
instead of The Higher... (not showing any personnel from your hand). You
lose 7 points, but your opponent does not get the 100. Or combine the two,
making your RC:Craps action dependent on the current score of your opponent.
This makes it nearly risk-free. If you could now only read his mind to find
out where he's gonna put his outpost this time... ;-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Gift of the Tormentor + The Higher... + Are these truly your friends ?

Hi, folks,

let's today check a card that can cause lots of fun, but also a high amount
of confusion. No, not P*r*ll*x *rg**rs (5 points because that was cool?),
but I'd strongly recommend putting a few of those in your deck the game
after you used a...

    @{b}TERRAFORMING STATION@{ub}

    Station, neutral, rare QC.

    Shields 16

Seed on any planet mission. If still in play at the end of game, redefine
that mission's requirements for next game with same opponent.

@{i}"Planets such as Velara III can be transformed to support life. This process
takes many decades."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, this is not a tournament card. But it's cool. You get to redo any or
all of a mission's requirements, which will allow you to create really
awkward combinations.

Let's try a few fun variations on old cards:

   * Hunt for Tribbles: Barbering x3 + Exobiology + Biology + Youth +
     CUNNING >40.
   * Investigate Love Continuum: Lwaxana Troi OR Kareen Brianon OR Horga'hn
   * Radical Reprieve: Treachery + Guaramba + SECURITY
   * Selling Plunder: Greed x2 + CUNNING >40
   * Exaction: Leadership + Greed + SECURITY
   * Veterinary Conference: One MEDICAL from each affiliation + one
     non-aligned ANIMAL

     and the unavoidable:
   * Eradicate Terraforming: SCIENCE + Geology + Computer Skill OR Locutus +
     ENGINEER x2.

So much for the fun ones. You can of course also use it strategically,
making each of your missions doable by a skill combination you have present
on two or even more cards in your deck. Try playing a deck with five
Terraforming stations. Redefine all your missions to allow your favorite
character to do them all alone. Next game, adjust your deck accordingly.
Just don't do it with Wesley Crusher - he might get the point ;-) And if
you're really smart and know a few persons who will be playing against you
in the next tourney, just draw them into a "practice game" a few days before
the tournament and slap down a Terraforming station or two. Just hope you
meet them in the finals.

Next one: Bluff. Know that player who always traces your very moves? Sure.
Use a few Terraforming stations to add lots of Empathy and Diplomacy to your
missions. He'll surely come up with a Diplomacy deck next game. You don't
even bother playing the missions you Terraformed - just add some Zaldans and
lotsa ENGINEERING and six space missions. He'll be stuck with all his planet
Dilemmas and his Diplomats won't be of much use against your missions
either.

Last try: Use it for whatever redefinition. Doesn't matter what. Next game,
play several Parallax Arguers:

WHAT REQUIREMENTS? Slap. Arguers + Red Alert.
HEY! THAT'S UNFAIR! Slap. Arguers + Traveler
YOU CAN'T DO THAT TWICE! Slap. Arguers + Kivas (they never learn)

Oh damn, which card was I reviewing? Is this a terraformed COTD? Help!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Terraforming Station + a cool redefinition + Parallax Arguers: 5
   points.
 * Terraforming Station + a redefinition nobody can remember + Parallax
   Arguers: Ultra-fast event play.

Hi, folks,


have you seen the copyright debate on the BBS? Good. Because that leads
directly to today's card (Sorry, Decipher, couldn't resist the temptation):


    @{b}THE SHELIAK@{ub}

    Dilemma, rare QC.

Place at far end of spaceline. End of every turn, moves toward this mission
(RANGE =6). Upon arrival, destroys any outposts, stations and Away teams
present. Mission then = zero points.

@{i}"A reclusive race of strict legalists that considers humanoids inferior.
Life-form classification R-3. The 2255 Treaty of Armens ceded several
planets to the Sheliak."@{ui}

;-)

According to paragraph 1, section 1, this card comes into play in a position
granting a mercy time of several turns to the defendant, in which the latter
is free to pursue any further action towards the goal the prosecution aims
to stop him from attending: The transfer of points from a planet mission
card to the score of the defendant.

As this cannot be the desirable outcome for the prosecution, flanking
measures towards reaching the prosecution's goals are strongly recommended
when using the object of discussion to reach the goal.

Subsection Q, Paragraph 10 indicates that a call for a robed judge named Q
will be fully appropriate in this very situation, as the judgement can
instantly place the defendant into a position where the object of discussion
can instantly take effect, causing the defendant to suffer a significant
loss in outpost and personnel possession which is not eligigable for damages
or compensation.

Alternatively, should the defendant not be found guilty by Q, the
prosecution can increase their chances by placing a temporary cease edict on
the defendant using a Dilemma that stops which would permit the prosecution
to make use of a Tkon Blade, an action definitely legal under these
circumstances.

Effective application of the object of discussion will, though, not require
any infractions against paragraph 187 targetting innocent away team members
as a sensible placement of the object will allow the removal of the criminal
supply line of the defendant (also called outpost). This measure alone will
often suffice to prevent the illegal acquisition of a score of 100 or more
points before the prosecution can achieve this goal.

Verdict:

The object of discussion shall be considered a legal card for use in good
decks.

Hi, folks,


so much email volume to reply to... I'd need more time all the way, but
somehow it still works out. Except when my mailer screws and I can't get
through with my COTD. Hopefully my little time-slowing experiments don't one
day result in an

    @{"(Classic COTD #21)" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD21"}


    @{b}ANTI-TIME ANOMALY@{ub}

    Event, rare

Plays on table. Kills literally ALL personnel on table (both players' cards)
at the end of your third full turn, unless anti-time anomaly destroyed
first.

@{i}"Q-created phenomena. Rift caused by anti-time particles in the future.
Anomaly grows backward in time endangering all life in the past."@{ui}

Ahhh, that's better. Now redo from start.

This event is both incredibly strong and incredibly vulnerable. Strong,
because it can take out a larger number of cards on the table than any other
STCCG card. Vulnerable because it needs to spend several turns on table
before it takes effect and can be nullified quite easily during that time.
Your opponent will often have enough time to even solve another mission in
order to get a Betazoid Gift Box or similarly potent stuff.

And more than most other cards, this card interacts directly with quite a
number of other cards:

   * Kevin Uxbridge. Of course, he nullifies the anomaly. But I mentioned
     him because he'll be responsible for most of the fuss with the Anomaly.
   * Time Travel Pod and/or Temporal Rift. Saves a crew. Only problem is
     your opponent can do it too.
   * Horga'hn. Gets your opponent down from three turns to react to one
     lousy turn if used correctly (i.e. you play the Anomaly on the first
     turn of a double turn).
   * Samuel Clemens' Pocketwatch. Not as good as the Horga'hn, but at least
     gets you from 3 down to 2 and can also compensate the eventual need for
     suboptimum play timing in the Horga'hn / Anomaly combo.
   * Rishon Uxbridge. One of the few sensible applications of the Event
     protector. That guy over there might have one Kevin, but does he have
     two?

Plus indirectly, a number of other cards gets involved.

   * Q's tent. Always good for a Kevin.
   * Amanda Rogers. Who said Temporal Rift?
   * End Transmission. Get your opponent on the wrong foot if he played his
     Temporal Rift too early.
   * Betazoid Gift Box. Another Kevin or Rift source when you need them.
   * Goddess of Empathy. Did he learn from the End Transmission disaster?
     Good. Play the Goddess next time around. Grin.

Ya see, enough possibilities. And as you have to consider the fact that this
card affects both sides, you will have to make sure that you don't
accidentally lose more than your opponent. In most cases, a single Anomaly
will lead to a major interrupt war unless one player has no counterspell
ready.

And you can of course put this to a good use: Drive out all those Kevins and
Amandas and finally let the anomaly go. Then play the stuff you really
wanted to get out.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Anti-Time Anomaly + End Transmission + Goddess of Empathy. Regardless
   when they try to Rift away, they'll be screwed.
 * Opponent's ATA + Amanda + Temporal Rift. He's gonna blow up his own
   crew.
 * ATA + Horga'hn. Just plain nasty. Add a Q2 or two for extra protection.

Hi, folks,


you'll get two COTDs today, the one I wrote yesterday somehow didn't get
through to you, so enjoy the double. (Should you experience headspin or
dizziness, you probably consumed a dangerous overdose; in this case
immediately consult your playing partner. The only known therapy for COTD
overdoses is a play session of at least three hours)

And in order to add a few lines to your mailfile, let's try this card (with
support by Locutus):


    @{b}YUTA@{ub}

    Dilemma, Either, rare QC.

Opponent chooses a number X. Randomly examine crew or Away Team one by one.
If (Integrity + Cunning - Strength) = X, discard that personnel and dilemma.

@{i}"An Acamarian of the clan Talesta. Carrier of a microvirus engineered to
instantly kill anyone with a particular genetic makeup."@{ui}

A super-Armus. That is, if you have a good memory. Because you'll need the
"Yuta numbers" in order to get the right person. And as I am lazy, I am just

So much for this. Keep it handy when playing Yuta (although it won't be
permissible in tournaments - you'll just have to memorize the important
numbers. Don't choose a number that is not present...)

Ah, review? Right. Armus was a good card. This one's better. First
advantage: It's Space and Planet. This alone makes Yuta a much better card
than Armus, you just can't get stuck with it against a pure space deck.

Second: Armus is random, Yuta is not. You almost get to choose the personnel
who is going to die. Tired of that Roga Danar? Say 2. Need to nail Bev
Crusher to disable the Genetronic Replicator? Choose 11. Just make sure you
don't overlook any attribute enhancers. Phasers get the numbers down by 2,
PADDs increase by 2 and Lower decks is a +2 on all universals. That
unpronouncable fish cancels itself out; Interphasic Plasma creatures give +2
and the Varon-T disruptor causes really weird changes as does Rascals.
Easiest to calculate: Frame of Mind. Sets any result to an exact 3.

Now what if you desperately want to kill a specific personnel but your
opponent was so nasty to play a useless card with the same magic number?
Hehehe, how about Brain Drain? Double nasty on a good MEDICAL destined to
operate the Genetronic Replicator. Drain Beverly Crusher down to a Yuta 3
and hit her with the Dilemma. There isn't much competition for a 3 in a Fed
deck. A Barclay's or similar stuff can then take care of the rest of the
crew. (Add in a Tarellian Plague ship for extra fun). Why the Yuta here? Two
things: First, Beverly could still go to the plague ship or function as
MEDICAL even if Brain Drained (classification is not removed) and second,
you don't need to rely on that Brain Drain being in your hand do much.

Actually, for my taste, this Dilemma is already a little too strong
especially if you know your numbers well. Six of these in a deck can spoil a
lot of strategies and opportunities for nasty combos abound if you have a
killer that (nearly) unpreventably gets rid of a person of your choosing if
you have any kind of luck.

Cure: Marouk. Serious crews can't afford to be without her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Yuta + any Dilemma that kills entire crew unless [...]. You'll nearly
   always find a way to get rid of the [...] part.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #309@{ub}


Hi, folks,

here's a card whose title we had before... And actually, the game effect was
not that much different, only it was no Q-Event (not surprising, at the time
of Internet Expansion II QC was not much more than a rumor). Anyway, here's
the official version of


    @{b}PENALTY BOX@{ub}

    Q-Event, uncommon.

If any Penalty Box already in play, put its occupant out-of-play and replace
with new victim (random selection). Discard Event. Otherwise, place on table
and put one personnel present (random selection) here. (If nullified, return
occupant to owner's hand).

@{i}"Unfortunately there's only one penalty box. If any of you should be sent
there, dear Tasha must give the box up to you... and go into nothingness."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A neato card. Overpowered Armus to be exact. In terms of removing one
personnel from play, this Q-Event has exactly the same power as the black
soul. Only that it also works in space, does not take up a seed card and
Genetronic Replicators and similar stuff are ineffective. Getting the
personnel back is of course possible, but it usually costs a valuable Kevin
(instead of the Res-Q) and you'll be in no better position than the one
gained from Res-Q: You have the crewmember in your hand and have to replay
it.

But no power comes without a price and this price is the risk you take when
playing this card against an opponent who himself uses the Penalty Box,
because in that case, you'll look at losing your last chance to rescue one
of your crew cards should he attempt a mission. And here's where the real
fun starts. While your opponent desperately waits for a Kevin to regain his
Data from the Penalty Box, you assemble a quick and dirty away team in the
hopes of triggering a Penalty Box yourself and moving his Data into the
void. In the rare case a good personnel of yours has to be put on the stake
for this venture, just have your own Kevin or Q-Flash ready to relieve that
poor guy from his fate you just sent him into.

Probably the best Q-card in the entire set as it rivals (and in some ways
exceeds) the powers of an often-used rare Dilemma. Definitely worth to have
in multiples, even though this means you might have to discard one now and
then because of a duplicate under one mission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Penalty Box(es) + Armus + Yuta + MLI + FLI + Parallel Romance + Thine
   Own Self (throw in Alien Abduction or just a plain old killer like
   Barclay's Disease if you want to be able to nuke Away Teams of more
   than 8)

Hi, folks,

welcome to the MEGABYTE edition of COTD! Right, those of you who have
collected all of my COTD articles from #26 to this one now have one Megabyte
of strategy on their hard disks. Now if I only had one dollar for each of
those bytes ;-) ...

For a little less than a million dollars, however, you can get this

    @{"Classic COTD #22" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD22"}


    @{b}BEVERLY CRUSHER@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare.

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 8
    Strength 5

    MEDICAL, MEDICAL, Biology, Exobiology, Command Star (*).

@{i}"Dr. Beverly Crusher is the chief medical officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise.
Dancer and thespian. Widow of Jack Crusher. Mother of Ensign Wesley
Crusher."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep, my mom. And I wouldn't dare to write badly about her. Not that I'd love
her that much, but just because I can't find anything bad. First and best,
she's one of the core cards of any Fed speed deck. Her ability to solve
Evaluate Terraforming, the best Federation mission, all by herself, is
invaluable, especially if your opponent also plays that card (very probable
thing if she also plays Federation).

A cool bluff (Betazoid Gift Box, Q-Flash and two intentional mis-seeds) will
keep your opponent from placing her outpost there and then you just drop
down yours. Just place Bev in your Q's tent and hope for at least one tent
in your opening hand. Bang! Instant 35 points and a Gift Box, meaning you'll
not run out of good cards for the next few turns. That'll teach your
opponent to play the same affiliation as you do.
(I once scored a great victory this way. My opponent played mainly space
Dilemmas and somehow overlooked to place anything under Evaluate
Terraforming. My opening hand included Bev, Data, a Runabout and a Devidian
Door. I had a Horga'hn under ET and Investigate Time Continuum next to it
with a BGB seeded there. I went first, play Beverly, solve ET (35), play
Data with the Door, attempt ITC (after Full Planet Scan), hit Impassable
Door (yeah, it was the last game of a looong round-robin tournament), score
35, grab Danar, a second D. Door and Distortion of Space-Time Continuum with
the Gift Box, first turn ends. Second turn, play Runabout, Door in Danar,
move to ITC, pick up Data, move 3 more span, play Distortion, move to
Restore Errant Moon, attempt it, hit Female's Love Interest, score, show two
doors. The entire thing lasted less than 90 seconds and my opponent never
got to play a card ;-) )

Okay, so much for first-turn victories (rather hard to pull off). But
Beverly's qualities don't just end after the first turn (unlike those of a
certain $250 Magic card). A dual MEDICAL is a good thing to have for
Genetronic Replicators (two dual MEDICAL are even better, but who's
nitpicking?) and there is no classification with so many x2 and x3 demands
on Dilemmas than MEDICAL.

And the two other dual MEDICALs? There's Bev Picard, but she lacks
Exobiology (vital against Zaldans and good for several missions) and if hit
by a Tsiolkovsky Infection, both of her MEDICAL are gone instead of just
one. And then, Kate Pulaski. Two MEDICAL plus SCIENCE but the beaming
limitation disqualifies her for really fast decks. You also don't get any
vital skills besides the three classifications. I'd prefer a Vekor in most
situations... In the end, there's nothing to replace the original. And don't
forget the cool (5 points) Parallel Romances Beverly can have with her son
;-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

* Beverly Crusher + Data + Roga Danar + Vekor: Four-person all-purpose
  mission solver crew.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #311@{ub}


Hi, folks,

does this card "Ring" a notion with the CCG (here: Magic) veterans among
you?


    @{b}TRUST ME@{ub}

    Q-Event, common QC.

Plays on table until any Q-Flash. Each time you play an Amanda Rogers card
(except to nullify a Q icon card), opponent may place two non-artifact cards
from outside the game into opponent's own discard pile.

@{i}"You can do it, Amanda... close your eyes... remember them."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is more than good against a counter-deck. Remember: Each Amanda your
opponent plays gets two cards of your choosing into your discard pile from
where they only wait to be Res-Qed or Palored. So basically your discard
pile is turned into a Q's tent. That is, if you have several of these in
your Q-continuum and your opponent is nice enough to attempt at least one
mission. And, you'll need to play enough cool Interrupts to make your
opponent actually use those Amandas. Somehow seems to me like an awful lot
of restrictions. But then, what power can you await from these 1/5ths of a
card (assuming your opponent hits the Q-Flash with an average of 5 people
and you have enough Flashes seeded)?

Okay, so much for using Trust Me as a real strategy. Yep, it might work and
if it does, you have a Q's tent that does not stop you from drawing cards
and contains far more options than the real one (your entire collection is
fair game, and just think 'bout Dream cards), but the probabilities of
everything working in your favor are depressingly small.

But even if it works only once, you can exchange a Palor for a card you
desperately need. And as that card can come from your entire collection,
you'll find something that can save your sorry butt unless the situation is
really hopeless to start with.

Yeah, and then there are the certain possibilities gained by combining
different games. Unfortunately using Magic cards is out of the question as
Land cards cannot legally be played in STCCG and Artifacts (Moxes and the
Lotus) are prohibited by Trust Me, so you'll be in real mana trouble. And
the Alliances pitch spells do not have any sensible effect in STCCG. But
there already was a combo on the 'net involving SWCCG (The key is Juri Juice
that lets you activate some Force with which to play other SWCCG cards) and
maybe other games will also be linkable (though I don't know another good
example from the top of my head...)

Your best bets (apart from playing a fair match) will still be the various
Dream Cards floating around on the net.

Okay, final result? The card gives your opponent a choice. Let your
Interrupts pass (often not the worst idea, many of them are not that
gamebreaking) or give you some extra options. I'd say that's enough for 0.2
cards...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

   * Trust Me + Palor + any Dream Card that just fits the Situation.
   * From the 'net (who was that?): Trust Me + Palor x 2 + Juri Juice +
     Revolution + Warped Space.
   * (c) Tebok: Trust Me + Stargazer. Ouch ! ;-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #313@{ub}


Hi, folks,

those of you who thought I might override that #312 with a "real" COTD,
rest assured this will *never* happen. That one day in history shall
forever be remembered in the COTD archives. And I hope it will also be
remembered
in your minds. In 2001, you can tell your new STCCG apprentices that you
have been there on the day when our game was reborn. Then show them a
*real* QC card and they'll place you somewhere between Warren Holland
and Gene Roddenberry on their list of legends. Ah, did I say QC card and
did I also mention old age ?


    @{b}TIMICIN@{ub}

    Personnel, non-aligned, uncommon QC.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 8
    Strength 3

    CIVILIAN, ENGINEER, Astrophysics, Physics, Scores 10 points if helps
    solve Test Mission, Discarded when you reach 60 or more points. Staff
    Star (+).

@{i}"Kaelonian. Romantically involved with Lwaxana Troi. Must submit to
The Resolution at age 60."@{ui}

Well, well. Nearly a Geordi, just lacks the Computer Skill and the second
ENGINEER. Instead he has the CIVILIAN classification and the extra bonus
for Test Mission. Not that Test mission were *that* great, but increased
to a 35-pointer with only one skill requirement this could provide a
substantial early game advantage. Unless you're playing Romulan.
Now what more ? That dual classification is still somewhere in my mind.
And I always preach dual classifications are *good*. don't I ? Just this
one does not seem to hit very well. While ENGINEER is always great, it's
the CIVILIAN that starts me thinking. The latter has two good uses.
First, Colony. CIVILIANs get you extra points there, don't they ? That
is if they stay alive. Just poor old Timicin will leave the stage once
you start scoring some real points. And that means he'll not be there
for too long. R*ts.
Second use: Kurlan Naiskos. That little Artifact that makes your ships
better than the average Borg Ship. Just too bad it's an Artifact. Once
you have it, you also have around 35 points. Which means that you are not
going to get too much out of Timicin unless you exclusively go hunting
for ships and outposts before trying any other mission. D*rn.
So forget that CIVILIAN classification. If you need that combo, go for
Kareen Brianon instead. Same price tag, same expansion.
So as a result, you have a card quite similar to Magic's Black Lotus.
Strong in the early game, but useless if drawn late. Just not as good.
If you don't go for an incredibly fast deck and make heavy use of Q's
Tent, you can put him there. Though I'd usually rather get a Red Alert
or a Traveler from there if I get a tent in my starting hand.
But if you just got *too* many tents at a time, you might as well re-
trieve Timicin.


Favorite combo(s):

- Errr, what shall I say ? Timicin + Test Mission, maybe ?

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #314@{ub}


Hi, folks,

this one will be the second last classic. Yes, I know, it's only
#23, but #24 is Mot and before I redo him, I'll wait for the
resolution of the Barbering gag, so here's the penultimate classic:

    Classic COTD #23


    @{b}SELA@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan, rare.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 9
    Strength 8

    V.I.P., Diplomacy, Leadership, Treachery, Youth, Command Star (*).

@{i}"1/2 Romulan, 1/2 Human female. Daughter of alternate timeline
Lieutenant Natasha Yar. Powerful operative and key figure in the
Romulan hegemony."@{ui}

(Now of course, I'm stealing our good Major Rakal a card to review,
but I have a schedule to follow...)
Our good Sela is the only pre-QC Romulan with four skills, and she's
also the most famous of them all. But when I look at those skills,
they're not that great. Diplomacy is a must in any deck for Shaka and
Q-Net, but non-aligned figures like Dathon, Devinoni Ral, Maques
and Marouk can take care of that just as well, with the added bonus
of two of them having Empathy, too, and the other two capable of
nullifying some Dilemmas as well.
Youth, well, err, not very useful. Especially as there are exactly
two Romulan-doable missions that require Youth and both are triple
affiliation and they, well, s*ck for Romulan use. (Study Plasma
Streamer is okay for Feds because of Wesley, but for Romulans ?
No single card Astro / Youth combination).
Leadership ? Well okay, but don't you have a Roga Danar somewhere ?
(If not, trade your Sela for him, you'll easily get that trade...)
That guy is really useful, unlike what we saw of Sela until now.
Then, Treachery. A cute skill and many Romulan missions need
multiples of it, but then so many Rommies have it.
Skill combinations: 3 useful ones for Pegasus Search, but that
thing needs INTEGRITY > 40, so you'll need a big Romulan crew
if you want to do it without the Artifact. Maybe the Leadership +
Treachery on Covert Installation, but you can do that with
Roga Danar and any other Treachery. That's about it.
High Attributes are okay, but did they have to make Cunning a 9 ?
One Hunter gangs, and so long, Sela! Yuta number 7... Maybe
that makes Sela worth something - as an uncertain protection
for Taris (only one other Rommie has that 7: Tokath, but who
plays *him* ?). At least she's Firestorm-proof.
Well, so much for a card that could have been far better. Give her
an OFFICER skill to make her attractive for Naiskos decks, or a
built-in Espionage: Rom on Fed would also have been nice. This
way: Binder stuffing.
Oh, BTW: At least one rater noticed that Sela's a Sirol minus
ENGINEER and Navigation. Just blonde. (Thanx, Tebok ;-) )

Favorite combo(s):

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #315@{ub}


Hi, folks,

how about one more of those highly specialized cards of which the
uses are hidden away so well most people won't find them ?


    @{b}IMMORTAL AGAIN@{ub}

    Event, uncommon QC.

    Nullifies Mortal Q (plus any Calamarain). Your Q-Continuum is active
    again. Discard Event. (Immune to Kevin Uxbridge) OR Exchange for one
    Amanda Rogers or Q2 card from your discard pile.

@{i}"Following Q's 'selfless act', Q2 reluctantly restored his powers. He
warned Q to try to stay out of trouble - just in time to save the
Calamarain from further torment."@{ui}

Before I start reviewing the strategic options, I'll submit this
card to the unofficial one man rules committee and hope that this
will be able to dissect the card text.
1) Nullify one Mortal Q. You will need a Mortal Q on the table to
execute this option, regardless on which side he is. But he has
to be there. When you use this function, two more effects are
triggered, if applicable:
1a) Your Q-Continuum, if closed, is reactivated. But this will not help
you against Revolving Door or Door-Net. Though both of these close the
continuum and the continuum will be reactivated for a moment, they will
stay in place and reseal the continuum. (Note that is not a problem
with Door-Net as that one will be dispelled by the next Q-Flash seen
anywhere and thus not do anything anyway.
1b) Any Calamarain on table, regardless of the number of these cards
present, will be nullified. The effects of already successfully
resolved Calamarain are not undone.
If you use this function of Immortal Again, the card is immune to
Kevin Uxbridge.
2) Play Immortal Again to your Discard Pile if you have at least one
Amanda Rogers or Q2 there (again, the play is illegal if it does not
have a target) and retrieve one Amanda or Q2 to your hand.
In this function, Immortal Again is not immune to being Uxbridged.
(Disclaimer: I do not say these answers are all correct, but I strongly
suspect most of them are.)

So this dashes the hopes of players who want to use Immortal Again as
a Calamarain Counter card (use an Uxbridge, guys!). But two uses remain
and they are, while applicable only to rare situations, quite vital.
First, if you play a Q-Flash heavy deck, you'll need to be able to rely
on those flashes, so an unplanned The Naked Truth can really screw with
your plans. Better have an Immortal Again somewhere and restore your
continuum as quickly as possible.
Sneaky variation: If your opponent hit The Naked Truth and you managed
to send him a Mortal Q, use Immortal Again to nullify *his* Mortal Q
and (well, this is void, but I'll mention it) reopen *your*
(already open) Q-Continuum. Of course, he's now in the trouble that
he'll have to Res-Q his Mortal Q to be able to do something about his
situation. Throw in a Countermanda and start solving some missions
without fearing any Q-Flashs.
Second use: If you think you might urgently need an Amanda or Q2 soon,
get it from your discard pile without running the risk of being
Countermanda'ed. Not very sensible wasting an Event for something an
Interrupt could do nearly as well, but if you really fear a misplaced
Countermanda, this might be an option.
But somehow, all this stuff depends on your opponent heavily using
certain cards. So while vital, these functions are not what you need
in every game. Thus, taking the card into your deck is not a very
sensible option. Leaving it out isn't, either. So there's only one
place to put the card: In your Q's tent. And be told, one of these
beauties should go into every tent side deck belonging to an even
half-decent deck, especially as retrieving the Event from the tent
does not cost you an extra turn. Just do it at the start of your turn.

Favorite combo(s):

- Immortal Again + Mortal Q + The Naked Truth + Countermanda
  (to really screw your opponent's Continuum)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #316@{ub}


Hi, folks,

let me finish off that last piece of the Classic business. Some of
you might get to miss this longest-running subset in COTD, but
this won't be the last ever subset... Oh, speaking of subsets -
how about Internet Expansion III ? With all these Dream cards
floating around, we could as well do that.

Rules ?

Easy. Send me up to four card ideas, complete with game effect, lore,
title, and whatever else is needed. Listings in COTD format greatly
appreciated. I'll sort out the best 15, add 3 ideas of mine and send
everything to my raters for voting on the top 8. They will then be
COTD #333 to #340.
Everything from the scope of the new contract (TNG, DS9, VOY and First
Contact) is fair game except for basic versions of main characters.
Please don't bore me with the 37th Miles O'Brien variation or the 24th
Janeway. AU versions of those characters are however fine, just please
be a little creative. Oh, and not another version of the DS9 station
or the Voyager either, okay ?
The results of your creative efforts should arrive here until the
release date of COTD #325.

But back to issue #316...

    @{"Classic COTD #25" link "STCCG:cotd100.guide/COTD25"} (the last one)


    @{b}PALOR TOFF - ALIEN TRADER@{ub}

    Interrupt, common.

    Exchange this card for any non-Personnel card in your discard pile.

@{i}"Rich merchant and trader from an unknown race. Friend of Kivas
Fajo. Snappy dresser."@{ui}

One of the "must have" cards. The secret of Palor is that he is not
just one card, but several cards in one. Think of a deck in which you
have 2 Kivas, 2 Kevins, 2 Amandas and 2 Q2s. Plus 5 Palors. How many
cards is this ? 13 ? Almost. This bunch takes up space for 13 cards in
your deck, but you really have 28. Drawing a Palor is nearly as good
as drawing a Joker in Rummy if you have a deck design like the one I
just outlined, with lots of countering power and highly reactive.
However, unlike Q's tent, Palor Toff has a severe limitation. He
cannot duplicate cards that have not yet been played. So it won't
help you having seven Palors in your hand if your only Kevin Uxbridge
is buried at the bottom of your deck and you urgently need that card.
So Palor is for non-personnel cards what Lal and Vulcan Mindmeld are
for Personnel - a means to duplicate the aspects of a card you have
played before.
So much for what you can plan to do with good old Palor. But he's also
great in those situations you cannot exactly plan for. So, for example,
why include an extra outpost just for the case you might lose your
original one when Palor can do the same job, just better ? Or what
if your best ship is sent to the trash by a Supernova ? Same answer, and
you can do it all with a card that still has a good use if neither of
these unplanned nasties come your way. Just keep an Amanda handy if
you really want to rely on Palor, otherwise you might find yourself on
the wrong end of a Countermanda card.
And Palor vs. Res-Q ? Palor cannot get back personnel. But if you have
once used Res-Q, he can. Just get the Res-Q and then the personnel. So
if the question is which one you want to duplicate in your deck, the
answer should be easy.
One last point: Palor is an Interrupt so he costs you no card play and
thus no turn. Just don't forget that there's one thing that's however
not possible: Using Palor to get an Amanda you need to counter that
nasty Interrupt your opponent just played.

Favorite combo(s):

- Palor Toff x 4 + Kevin Uxbridge x2. Six Uxbridges, plus four of them
  are much better than the normal ones.

- Palor Toff x 4 + Res-Q. So who says you can't get personnel back with
  Palor ?

And here's a little quiz (Palor-related):

I once made a card of myself. The first version read

    CMDR. CRUSHER

    Personnel, Federation, rare.

    OFFICER, ENGINEER, Computer Skill x2, Gain 2 points for each card you
    play. Command Star (*), AU Icon. 6/9/5.

Why is this card *horribly* broken ? (Solutions by email, and those of
you who have seen this question back around #150, don't spoil it for
the others, please)

Hi guys,

you're getting much better... First time I asked that question I got a
measly two answers, this time my mailbox is overflowing (and in spite of
me never publishing the answer the first time around) ;-)

Anyway, I'll solve it for those who didn't get it:

Your opening hand: Cmdr Crusher, Full Planet Scan, Scan, Palor Toff x2,
rest does not matter.

Play Cmdr Crusher. Drop Scan or Full Planet Scan on one location
(doesn't matter which, I just need that card in my discard pile), score
two points.
Use Palor to get the just-used card back (2 points), use Palor to get
Palor back (2 points), repeat last move until satisfied.

So here's the corrected Cmdr Crusher card:

CMDR. CRUSHER
Personnel, Federation, rare.
OFFICER, ENGINEER, Computer Skill x2, Gain 2 points for each
*non-interrupt* card you play. Command Star (*), AU Icon. 6/9/5.

Still strong, but not that broken...

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #317@{ub}


Hi, folks,

just for fun, a Q-card again...


    @{b}DOOR-NET@{ub}

    Q-Event, common QC.

    Plays on one of your Doorway cards in play (your choice) until
    any Q-Flash. Doorway is now closed. May be nullified by Alter-
    nate Universe Door OR by showing 2 Diplomacy from your hand
    during your turn.

@{i}"Stay where thou art."@{ui}


Yet another variation on the Q-Net. This time quite a powerful
one, though. In modern STCCG, players do play with doorways or they
stand a good chance of losing the game (like 99% or so).
Obviously this card has a lot in common with the Revolving Door. It
closes one doorway, and that's a good thing for the opponent of
the so affected player. However, this card is much cheaper to play
(it does not cost a card play or a slot in the deck), so it does
also have some disadvantages to balance it all out. First of all,
it's a Q card, so your opponent won't be hit unless he attempts a
mission. But as most players are going to do this sooner or later
in a game (unless they have a cool (5 points) name like Tebok ;-) )
this is not the worst of limitations. Though you will not be able
to count on the effect of this card in the first few turns.
More severe is the limited effect duration (until the next Q-Flash)
and, from the same department, the multitude of possibilities to get
rid of the Door-Net. Not only do you have the AU door and Kevin
Uxbridge as for Revolving Door, you also have the "show 2 Diplomacy"
option and the Q-Flash. Of course, you should never use a Q-Flash
just to nullify this card, rather use it to nix the next card that
would affect you and the Door-Net goes right with it.
Third and worst: The affected player gets to choose which Doorway is
going to be closed. And if you run up against players like a certain
Wesley Crusher, that player might laugh about Door-Net. Why ? In many
decks, I only use the AU Door to allow myself to play some of the
nasty AU Dilemmas. I don't have a single AU card in my draw deck (or
just one or two minor cards), so I can easily live without my AU door
for a turn or two. Of course, other players think themselves terribly
smart by throwing the Door-Net on their Q-Continuum thinking "it re-
opens with the next Q-Flash, so I'm not losing anything". Wrong!
The Q-Flash will pass without effect and then the Continuum will
reopen. However, there's nothing against putting the Door-Net on a
Q-Continuum already closed by a misplaced Mortal Q.
And what if you as the affected player really can't find a place for
the Door-Net where it doesn't hurt ? Redshirt a mission where you
suspect (or seeded) a Q-Flash. Cures the Door-Net very fast.
In the end, a good effect, but too easy to redirect or nullify.


Favorite combo(s):

- Door-Net + Revolving Door. Now that you know what Doorway he doesn't
  need, close the one he does need !

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #318@{ub}


Hi, folks,

those among you who have recently frequented Jonathan's chat room might
know I love to name this card when a certain Lt. Hawk is there...
(see, it's so easy to achieve COTD fame ;-) )
... a certain Hawk who always uses Iconian Gateways! And just for him,
here's the cure:


    @{b}WRONG DOOR@{ub}

    Interrupt, rare QC.

If opponent just used Iconian Gateway, redirect the exit to another
planet OR Nullifies one Q's Tent played from hand OR Move Revolving
Door to a different doorway.

@{i}"Jean-Luc Picard had intended to step through an Iconian Gateway to
the U.S.S. Enterprise, but lack of time forced him to settle for a
nearby Romulan Warbird instead."@{ui}

Somehow I would have liked a different title for this card... like
"Oops!". But Wrong Door just fits the effect. And once again we have
one of those OR-laden interrupts with several highly specialized
functions. Unfortunately all three depend on your opponent doing some-
thing, so there's not much you can do when your opponent is not
cooperative enough to do any of the things named on the card (Unless
you want to move your own Revolving Door just in case you slapped it
on the wrong doorway, but in this case, you should maybe reconsider
your strategy for the next game anyway).
Use 1: Cause a lot of trouble for an opponent who thinks Iconian
Gateway is a great idea. There are not many better feelings in STCCG
than sending an entire bridge crew to Qualor II, especially if that
Bridge Crew is your opponent's ;-). Just too bad there aren't that many
people playing the Iconian Gateway, otherwise it might be real fun.
Still, any time you get to send your opponent's core crew to a distant
planet beyond rescue is a good time.
BTW: Works great in a Romulan deck with a high percentage of non-aligned
crew as you can not only seed but even solve Qualor II.
Counter-strategy: Who says you have to move your entire crew at once ?
Just announce one transport after the other. Gives your opponent a
little
more choice for a Barclay's Transporter Phobia, but you'll at worst lose
one to the Wrong Door. (And if you fear both Gateway counters, move two
cards at a time - a good one and a crappier one. Only a 50% chance for
your opponent to hit something good and still you're pretty safe from a
massive Wrong Door strike.
Use 2: Nullify a Q's Tent played from hand. About the same effect as a
Subspace Schisms, only more predictable. Deny your opponent a great card
draw. As most serious decks will have a tent, this is almost always a
fallback strategy if you can't use the anti-Gateway function of the
Door.
But even on its own, this use is pretty good, especially as doorways
played
from your hand cannot be countered that easily.
Use 3: The ultimate Revolving Door counter. Not just that you get rid of
the Revolving Door on your Doorway, you can also place it on your
opponent's.
And that's something that hurts. Too bad so few opponents use Revolving
Door
(har, har).
Net result: As one of the conditions (#2) is pretty common, this card
might
even be useful in a main deck. But even if not, a good tent card for
sure.


Favorite combo(s):

- Wrong Door (use #1) + Qualor II. Gets rid of a lot of good crew
  (if used against a bad [read: not COTD-reading] opponent).

Hi, folks,

now that I'm finished showing the Red Card to a few netiquette breakers

you *THE* red card.


    @{b}KITRIK@{ub}

An uncommon Klingon with a dual classification and three useful skills
on top of that ? What universe is this ? (The STCCG universe, dork).
Ah, well, let's stick with it for the moment and accept this card at
face value.
From classifications, we have a male Vekor. SCIENCE plus MEDICAL. Not
too shabby, especially since the Klingons didn't have too much great
support in either area (except for Kurak). But even not counting skills,
there's one thing that makes Kitrik superior to Vekor: his Integrity of
6, which means he's invulnerable to Firestorm and (due to his 7 Cunning)
also to Thought Fire. If it weren't for that odd Cunning number that
makes him vulnerable to Hunter Gangs...
But there are still these skills. Now what is a SCI/MED guy good for ?
Right, getting rid of Dilemmas. And just for fun, when we have a Dilemma
solver, we get Exobiology as a bonus, protecting our Diphole(TM)
characters from a misplaced Zaldan and untimely Coalescent Organisms.
And while we're at it, even being male is an important asset for Kitrik.
Just as a defence against those nasty [COTD or Rakal-review reading]
players who prefer to prefix a Barclay's disease with a Female's Love
interest to get rid of a MEDICAL.
Now that's the Dilemmas. But there's more to this game than solving
Dilemmas. Scoring points for example. Like with a Ressikan Flute (Um,
how many Klingon musicians are there ?). Or getting cards into play so
you can actually start doing missions (like Soong-type Androids). How
does it sound to you to just play 5 personnel cards on your first turn
because of good old Kitrik ?
So Kitrik is of help when preparing to solve missions, just before doing
so and even after doing it. And for actual mission requirements ? Pretty
much zip. But that's what the rest of your deck is for.


Favorite combo(s):

- Kitrik + 4 Soong-Type Androids + Sensitive Search. Who said you can't
  solve a heavily Dilemma'ed mission on your first turn ?

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #320@{ub}


Hi, folks,

as the last delay in COTD writing was caused by a one-day army reserve
exercice I had to do, I guess I'll stick with the theme and do an issue
on patriotism - err sorry wanted to say


    @{b}THE ISSUE IS PATRIOTISM@{ub}

    Q-Interrupt, uncommon QC.

You must immediately initiate a battle at one location that has
opposing ships or Away Teams (if any). "Stopped" cards are "un-
stopped" long enough to battle. No leaders are required and no
affiliation restrictions apply. (Immune to Q-Flash)

@{i}"'You slaughtered millions in silly arguments about how to divide
the resources of your little world.'"@{ui}


Um, well. A card that forces a battle. Well, we had that kinda stuff
before, but this one has the advantage to be absolute. No require-
ments, no affiliation restrictions and nothing else except for an
unplanned Amanda.
But let's remove one idea from your head. Using this card to force
your opponent to start a losing battle is at best highly unreliable.
The person encountering this card can choose at which location to
start a battle, so you will have to keep moving a lot in order to
always keep a superior force available and making sure that every
force you have at an opponent's location is superior. But if you
are able to do this, you don't need this card - you just attack.
Unless, of course, you are a civilized, cultural, educated, peaceful
and overall nice-mannered person using blue cards. In this case you
will need a little help. And this card could just be the help you
need. Slap down a Wartime Conditions once the dust has settled to
ensure you have the ability to stir up more of it.
Oh, did I say Wartime Conditions ? Well, maybe you don't even
need to create a winning situation to take advantage of your patriotic
opponent. Just send Mot on a strafing tour, lonely on his runabout.
He won't cause much damage, but the death of a Bolian isn't something
the admirality will take lightly. Point taken and war started. ("Hey,
it wasn't us! Those Klingon terrorists have attacked a harmless
spyieeech traveling Civilian.")
So far, so good. Smells like a Fed battle deck. Just one problem here.
You use Q-cards to increase your effective deck size beyond 60 as they
are essentially free. This function isn't too well fulfilled if you
need to dedicate three cards (a ship, a crewmember and Wartime Con-
ditions) to make any use of it. And if you make use of enhancer cards
to ensure that your ship is not in danger (Metaphasic Shields would
work well here), you have barely managed to substitute two cards with
one new, still requiring two cards and at least the temporary dedi-
cation of a ship plus crew to your patriotic issue. Which, as a net
effect, means this Q-card misses the real purpose of a Q-card.
Forget it, next candidate please.



Favorite combo(s):

- Yeah, I told you. The issue... + Wartime Conditions. But that's
  about it.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #321@{ub}


Hi, folks,

almost forgot one card category in QC. But they're there albeit quite
scarce (they probably saved a lot of them for Fajo): Artifacts !


    @{b}BLADE OF TKON@{ub}

    Artifact, rare QC.

Immediately relocate any one planet location, and all cards there, to a
different place on the spaceline. Discard artifact.

@{i}"The Tkon Empire was so advanced that it possessed the ability to move
planets at will. The empire became extinct some 600,000 years ago during
the Age of Makto."@{ui}


This artifact functions as a mini-Q. (Now don't tell me it's a "q"! ;-))
Instead of rearranging the entire spaceline, you get to move one planet
to a different position. But as with several STCCG cards, this one has
a hidden limitation that severely hurts its usability. But that later.
Let's first take a naive look at the card and what you can use it for.
If your opponent's crew is just sitting at a planet location, you can
send them packing to the wrong end of the spaceline and thus cost your
opponent quite a few turns to get them back into a somewhat more
interesting area of space. Works even better if that opponent was a
clever guy like a certain Wesley who protected himself against an
untimely Alien Parasites by moving his ship one space away from the
mission location before declaring the attempt.
Of course the same thing works in the other direction, too. Been
Cytherian'ed, Love Interested or Bladed by a nasty opponent ? Just move
the planet and your crew back to a more civilized area of space. (With
Cytherians, you actually have more than just the "move back" option. If
you have a ship at a planet, you can get it to its target in just one
move and if the planet was your opponent's mission, even better. If it
only weren't for that secret limitation...)
The next use is very simple: Get back your outpost from the far reaches
after a Q hit your crew.
More ? Sure. There are a few things on the spaceline that move very
predictably. Borg Ships and Sheliak for example. How unpleasant for your
opponent should his key ship or crew suddenly pop out of a major
dimensional shift just to be blasted into nothingness by a space
nasty... Only that here, that d*rn limitation strikes again.
[WHAT LIMITATION ? GET TO THE POINT! OR I'LL MAKE YOU GET THE POINT!]
(I hate these people...)
Okay, the limitation. One word in the card text. "Immediately". You can't
leisurely solve a mission, put the blade in your hand and play it later.
Nope, you will have to use the effect at the very point of time you
complete the mission. Which means that timing will be very difficult for
the better uses like sending an unprepared Colony exploitation team into
the vicinity of the Sheliak or getting your just-Cytherianed ship to the
target in one microsecond.
And rescue missions using the blade will also be hampered by the fact
that you can't stock the blade until you need it. In most cases when
you'd be willing to use an Artifact to rescue a crew it's a pretty good
crew. Which means you need the lost people for mission-solving. So how
the heck are you to get the blade when you really need it.
Only really sensible variant: In Q's Tent together with a Q's Planet.
Just get them early, solve the Planet (if your opponent has not put any
planet Dilemmas into his tent) and your opponent will find his outpost
in the worst possible position. If you're lucky, this combo can be done
on 2nd turn (You need a Q's Tent, a unique personnel and a small ship in
the first 8 cards).

- Q's Planet + Blade of Tkon in Q's Tent.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #322@{ub}


Hi, folks,

how about a ho(m)norable servant to all empaths?


    @{b}MR. HOMN@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare QC.

    Integrity 9
    Cunning 3
    Strength 9

    CIVILIAN. Empaths may report for duty where present,
    May nullify Empathic Echo where present.

@{i}"Silent, imbibing, lurching, uttaberry-eating, faithful servant of Lwaxana
Troi. The only words he was known to speak were 'Thank you for the drinks.'"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ha! Lurch-ing, eh? Sure...

Anyway, something rather new in STCCG. Something like a living outpost. Only
that you can't use him to get all those ships, equipments and non-Empaths
to the place you need them at. But at least those Empaths get there.

So let's make use of the situation. First, what is it worth? You can play a
card to your crew after they left the outpost. Ideal for situations in which

   * you draw a card just the turn after you decided to go for it
   * or you don't have a Red Alert and some distance to pass. Saves you a
     turn or two.

The first situation usually isn't worth it. Empaths are mission-solvers not
Dilemma insurances. Which means you wouldn't start hadn't you already drawn
one, unless you go for a different mission and want to take the Empathy
mission on your way back home.

But the second situation could be quite interesting. Somehow your Red Alert
is buried at the bottom of your draw deck (or worse - in your binder) and
you urgently want to start scoring. Well, get these Empaths to the team
while you're already underway. Also helps against misplaced Kevins (i.e.
those used against you ;-) ).

Or, of course, play a deck that makes several cards in your opponent's deck
totally useless. Like one that has no Events or Interrupts except for a
Kevin Uxbridge (just submitted one of these for Tebok's DOTW). As you can
use Soong-Type Androids with Cybernetics to speed up your card play you have
a good way to get classifications out quickly and then your Empaths can
solve the missions. There are enough missions in Fed and F/R to do just
this. The fun here is to go out with just one Empath and a mission he/she
can solve and bring the remaining ones to your ship with Homn without ever
returning home. Plus, additional STA's can become CIVILIANs and score big in
a Colony. Nasty against those guys who think 6 Kevins and 5 Amandas make a
great deck.

Oh, nullify Empathic Echo? C'mon, you have SECURITY and MEDICAL, don't you?

A specialized but interesting card.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #323@{ub}


Hi, folks,

there's that one card whose designer I would really like to meet in a dark,
dirty alley. In which I'd keep him until he recalled each and every copy of
this:


    @{b}WESLEY GETS THE POINT@{ub}

Q-Interrupt, uncommon QC.

If you have Wesley Crusher present or on any planet, he scores 1 bonus point
and dies.

@{i}"You have only one chance to save them now. Send them back to the ship."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't get rid of the impression that this particular card has been
influenced by my little Wrath of Wesley deck that was published in InQuest
some months back. I'm pretty sure some people lost against that one and they
were all too glad to have a very suitable counter-card. (But who am I to
complain, I was guilty of the same thing by proving Tebok's arguer deck to
be beatable. The joys of CCGs...)

And then of course, there had to be something done about little Wesley being
a top ten personnel card. Like creating a risk when using the kid. But how
big is this risk? If your opponent knows you are going to play a fast Fed
deck, 100%. Just as high a probability as you putting Wes into a blue speed
deck. If your opponent does not know what you are playing, much lower, as
you can't just use Q's tent or a similar card to bring in a specialized
Q-card when you have seen your opponent's deck, putting this hoser into your
Q-continuum means losing one card if your opponent is playing without Wes or
didn't play him yet.

So what can you do? When designing a Q-continuum side deck, think about what
your opponent will do. If you think he'll play Fed, throw in 2 copies of
Wesley gets the Point. Otherwise none. If you're unsure, stick with none and
add an extra Penalty Box and/or Mandarin Bailiff, both quite effective
against Bridge Crew decks and more versatile.

On the receiving end, if you fear that your opponent might use the card,
surprise him by playing a Romulan Pseudo-Bridge crew deck with Galen, Nick
Locarno, Roga Danar, Taris, Sirol, Rakal and a Soong-type Android or two.
Just don't forget to exchange your missions when changing from Fed to
Romulan ;-)

At least the title of the card is good fun with the triple meaning of
"getting the point"

Hi, folks,

here's one in the spirit of giving christmas gifts (if you're nice) or
getting what naughty children deserve. Just not from Santa, but from Q...


    @{b}MANDARIN BAILIFF@{ub}

Q-Dilemma, common QC.

Opponent takes one personnel present (random selection) into custody (as a
captive) unless you "post bail" by transferring X points to opponent, where
X= the number of [dot] icons in that personnel's skill box.

@{i}"Criminal! How plead you?"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally a card that adds a little risk to the bridge crew and other god
personnel cards. Even though the amounts involved might at first seem
ridiculously low (one to six points), don't forget that the swing is
actually twice as large as the points are actually transferred.

So, let's assume your opponent is playing at least remotely decent personnel
cards. This means, most of them will at least have three dots, except for a
few with a special ability. So this does mean that the Mandarin will usually
net you a swing of around 6 points, more than a Lemon-Aid or most Dilemmas.
However, your opponent might choose not to pay the points but let you
capture the personnel. But you planned for this case and put an
Interrogation or Brainwash in your Q's tent, didn't you? And even if not,
you just denied your opponent a valuable card. Combined with Penalty Box and
Love Interests this card can start gnawing at your opponent's resources
which means he's more apt to listen to your friendly release offers (Gimme
those points!) at the next opportunity (read: The next mission he's gonna
do)

I should maybe note that Mandarin Bailiff does not count skills, but only
dots. Tainer, Rakal and Data's Body all only have two dots although they do
have more skills. These personnel cards almost have a limited immunity to
Bailiff.

What else? Not much more. A decent addition to any Q-Continuum because it
will always hit, one way or another. For a card that doesn't cost you a
card, not too shabby.

Hi, folks,

me thinks there was another card type in STCCG, one I don't visit very often.
Not because it would not be too hard to find cards of that type, just
because they are often not very interesting. Anyway, for the fans among you,
here's one. A ship, of course.


    @{b}T'PAU@{ub}

    Ship, Romulan, uncommon QC.

    Range 8
    Weapons 7
    Shields 6

    Requires 0 Command (*), 1 Staff (+). Tractor Beam,
    may report for duty at Qualor II.

@{i}"Vulcan merchant vessel named for the only person to ever turn down a seat
on the Federation Council. Stolen from Surplus Depot Zed-15 at Qualor II."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A good ship for any Armada deck. With the one staff as only requirement, you
can man quite a few of these. Add a Nutational shields and a Narik and you
have an Armada of 8/7/8's capable of blowing about everything out of space
with an investment of only 2 cards for each 7 firepower. A Bynar weapon
enhancement makes this 8/9/8. (8/6/8 or 8/8/8 for each ship beyond the 3rd,
as you run out of non-univ...

OOPS! HEY! THAT'S NOT THE T'PAU!!! (Actually it was a cool little quote from
a very old COTD - #70, to be exact)

Just somehow the old quote looks very much like our Romulan Beauty here.
8/7/6 for one staff star and equipped with a tractor beam. Yes, the named
K'Vorts are just the same thing. Well, almost. Except that they have a
cloaking device and this ship has a different special ability. And, what
shall I say, the K'Vorts have a different border color ;-) Okay, leaves us
with the differences.

The lack of a cloaking device is not too hard to swallow, these don't see
much use anyway. Instead we have a cool special ability, namely to report
for duty at a non-outpost location. Just too bad that ability isn't too
useful either as you will either already need a ship there to transfer crew
or use a Devidian Door to get your crew aboard the T'Pau. Remember, you
can't even leave a Romulan Redshirt on Qualor II - aligned personnel are in
stasis down there.

However, the most important limitation of the T'Pau is not printed on the
card. Rather, it is the absence of something that limits this otherwise cool
ship. Got it? The primary use of K'Vorts is to form a fast Armada. But for
an Armada, you'll need several ships. And that's what is missing. Other
ships of the same type. Too bad. But then, Romulans aren't Klingons or did I
miss something here?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * T'Pau + any non-aligned crew + Qualor II.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #327@{ub}


Hi, folks,

yesterday I did a card that could have been for the Klingons, so let's today
discuss one that is actually made for them:


    @{b}I AM NOT A MERRY MAN@{ub}


    Event, rare QC.

    Plays on any one Klingon. While in play, once per turn that Klingon may
    nullify one [Q] icon interrupt, event or dilemma where present. (Not
    duplicatable)

@{i}"'I will not play the fool for Q's amusement'"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, that's it. I still see one reason for using a Q-Flash in your draw
deck: You are playing Romulan. With all those decent blue Klingons, there
should not be too many Fed or Klingon decks without this card being at least
in your Q's tent (which is where you'd want it in a Fed deck - you don't
want it in your hand before you have drawn a Klingon) But otherwise, why use
a Q-Flash to nullify one Q-Icon card if you can as well nullify one per
mission attempt? All of that Q-Continuum stuff was about what I preach
nearly since COTD #26: Card advantage. If you can get rid of two cards of
your opponent with just one of yours, you have gained a 1.7% advantage (1 in
60). And the Q-Flash was the ultimate in card advantage with (realistically)
up to 8 nasty effects hitting your opponent for the price of one measly
card. But the weakness of the Flash is that those cards are weaker than a
standard card. But to nullify them, you'd still need a full card in your
draw deck - a bad ratio, considering that, on the average, you are only
nullifying about 1/4 of a card.

Now this event gets us back in line. With just one card, you can probably
select two to four Q-cards to nullify and they will always be the ones that
hurt you as you can have a look at them (however, you can't wait until the
resolution of the random selection), but anyway, getting out of the way of
the best card out of each Q-Flash is not the worst thing. That will at least
save you from those Penalty Boxes. So in the net effect, you will on the
average nullify a full card (if I assume 1 out of the average 4 Q-Flash
cards will be ineffective and thus the other 3 will count for about 1/3 of a
card) by attempting three missions, you have just taken away the best third
of your opponent's Q-Flash advantage without incurring a further card
disadvantage. Seems to work for me.

Just make sure you get it out early as it's not duplicatable. Also, I'd
usually stick this card into the tent even if playing Klingon to make sure I
won't have an ineffective card in my draw deck if my opponent does not use
the Q-Continuum side deck.

 * I am not a merry man + any Worf.

Hi, folks,

here's a card for a Wesley fan. What? A Wesley fan? Who in this galaxy could
be so stupid? ;-)


    @{b}ROBIN LEFLER@{ub}


    Personnel, uncommon QC.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 7
    Strength 4

    ENGINEER, Where present, nullifies Ktarian Game and Wesley Crusher
    is Cunning +2. Youth, Transporter Skill, Staff Star (+).

@{i}"Ensign transporter specialist. Romantically involved with Wesley Crusher.
Lefler's Laws include 'You gotta go with what works' and 'Life isn't always
fair'."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, finally, the absolute superiority in Cunning for a certain bridge crew
member. With a base of 8, 4 from Lakanta and 4 more for that Humumu....
mumu... kuamua... (damn!) Fish, that 16 rating wasn't too bad, but with
Robin's bonus old Wes can now acquire a Cunning of 18! (Which, considering
Einstein's IQ of 200 and Cunning of 11 would translate to an IQ of about
330. How's that for a little ego boost? ;-) )

But that's about it for my beloved Robin. 6/7/4 is nothing to waste a
subspace transmission on (especially with that odd Cunning - Hunter Gangs),
the Ktarian Game isn't exactly the worst Dilemma I have ever seen and the
rest is a Linda Larson with Transporter Skill.

Oh, did I say Transporter skill? Think I didn't say anything about that yet.
Most probably because, besides the effect detailed in the QC rule sheet, the
uses for Transporter skill currently quite easily fit into this one line:

"                                                           "

Oh well. Nevermind. Maybe if your opponent uses the combination of two
interlaced Distortion Fields, you can save a crewmember or two. But apart
from that, not the most useful of skills right now. A theme deck card (and
obviously not designed by the same person who committed that "Wesley gets
the Point" atrocity).

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #329@{ub}


Hi, folks,

for those of you who say QC has slowed down our game too much, here's a
turbo:


    @{b}MANHEIM'S DIMENSIONAL DOOR@{ub}


    Doorway, rare QC.

Plays on any planet. Affects all players. While in play, whenever any player
has a card in hand matching one just played by the opponent, the Manheim
Effect (a temporal "hiccup") may occur. Opponent's card is suspended while
player shows matching card, returns it to hand and plays any card from hand
as if played normally. (Not duplicatable). Nullify with Anti-Matter Pod.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, Decipher, what was that with my "environment" suggestion? A card that
is not duplicatable and affects all players? This could have been one.
Hrmph.

Anyway, what's the net effect. The game becomes fast. Terribly fast if you
are in a matchup with similar decks. Or if you're playing against an
opponent who plays a deck with just too many of a particular card like
Tebok's arguer deck. One Manheim's Door and one Parallax Arguer against that
deck, and you'll have a very hard time to get enough cards into your hand.
But of course, your opponent can also benefit from your door and by design,
the number of his different cards you could exploit is exactly the number of
your different cards he could benefit from. But there's one keyword here:
different. Many players use certain cards in multiples, often in substantial
numbers. And if you are playing a well-tuned highlander (one of a kind)
deck, you have a distinct advantage especially if you don't use up your key
cards (Kevins, Amandas, etc) too early.

Other situations in which you can greatly benefit from the Manheim Door:

   * You lost your Red Alert to a Kevin and cannot get it back. In this
     case, you can at least make up a little for the disadvantage.
   * You are playing a deck with a very high percentage of events.
   * You play with a high amount of card drawing power (Kivas, BGB,
     Traveler) Of course this card presents the usual "this is a rare
     doorway so it must be complicated" rules discussions. A few items from
     that:
   * It is perfectly possible to have a hiccup inside a hiccup inside a
     [...]
   * You go ahead showing and announcing cards until nobody has any more
     matching unsuspended cards. Then all these card plays resolve last to
     first. Example:
        o A plays Kevin on B's Traveler
             + B shows Kevin, plays Red Alert
                  + A shows Red Alert, plays Res-Q on Picard
                       + B shows Res-Q, plays Rishon Uxbridge on his
                         traveler
                            + A has no Rishon, thus
                       + B protects his Traveler
                  + A gets his Picard back
             + B gets his Red Alert
        o A resolves Kevin which no longer has a legal target.
   * Thus A must retarget his Kevin to any other event on the table. (There
     was an early ruling that he must now target the Rishon, but I don't
     think that should hold in the light that in the case of a Goddess of
     Empathy hiccup'ed into a Temporal Rift play that Rift must be taken
     back as there is no longer any legal target. Q, can you second this?)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Manheim's Door + Red Alert. The big Turbo.
 * Manheim's Door + Paul Manheim. The really big Turbo.
 * Manheim's Door + Kivas. Instant card infusion.

Hi, folks,

I'm back from that little hiatus (somebody discovered me hiding under an
STCCG card, oops ;-) )
Eh, what was that? Hiding under an STCCG card?

As in...


    @{b}MIRASTA YALE@{ub}


    Personnel, Federation, uncommon QC

    Integrity 7
    Cunning 5
    Strength 3

SCIENCE, Physics, Astrophysics, worth [5] bonus points to you while in play.
Staff Star (+), Must seed at Malcor III like a Dilemma.

@{i}"Malcorian scientist befriended by Jean-Luc Picard. Departed Malcor III
aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. SCIENCE, Physics, Astrophysics. That just cries for a really good
Space mission deck. Especially with that Astrophysics thing which is not
that common. But the catch of this card is somewhere else, namely the
ability / restriction of being seeded at Malcor III instead of being drawn
from your draw deck. Actually, this is a mixed blessing. On the up side, you
can save yourself a card draw plus gain ten easy points if you seed Yale and
Sarjenka at First Contact (Malcor III). On the other hand, you'll have to
make sure that you're seeding these practically last and you might want to
have a small ship early to fetch her (placing your outpost at First Contact
in a deck that's otherwise space missions tends to attract Outpost Raids).
Plus, you're placing a mission that's totally off the theme you are setting
with Mirasta.

Or is it? How about doing it the other way round? The Federation is not too
well equipped with good SCIENCE personnel. But in any Diplomacy/Empathy
deck, I am not looking for scientific skills, but just for the
classifications to pass the Dilemmas. Which means with an early Mirasta Yale
I do not have to wait for a SCIENCE to come up in my draw deck which means
two cards saved there. Optimum way to play this? Seed your outpost close to
First Contact but not on it. Use Runabouts as fast ships and get Mirasta
soon (using Sarjenka for 5 extra points and to avoid nasty Dilemmas that
might lie in waiting). Beam back up and reunite your crew. Then start your
regular mission solving spree a turn or two earlier than normal.

So what's the end result? Any deck with a Diplomacy component gets 10 free
points and a free card if played right. Guess I like that card...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Mirasta Yale + Sarjenka. 10 points plus a new crewmember. Not exactly
   bad...

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #331@{ub}


Hi, folks,

two issues to Internet Expansion III so get yourself ready... (I'll have a
few notes about that at the bottom) But first, this cool card:


    @{b}FRIGID@{ub}


    Q-Event, uncommon QC.

Plays on table. The next time you play an Interrupt card during opponent's
turn, opponent may place this event on any one of your SECURITY personnel in
play. Personnel is in stasis until any Q-Flash then discard event. May be
nullified by Fire Sculptor.

@{i}"'SILENCE!'"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A nuisance, especially if it occurs in multiples and is played well.
Remember that the "until any Q-Flash" only starts to count when the card is
triggered by playing an Interrupt. So if your opponent has several of them
ready, you'll not only lose one, but several SECURITY for some time (which
could well mean all your SECURITY). Baaad thing if your opponent prefers to
play the combo Barclay's Disease + Q-Flash under several missions, preceded
by a wall Dilemma if she's really smart. Regardless how badly you'd like to
get your SECURITY back, you'll be screwed unless you have at least three of
them in your deck...
...while she just sits there and exploits her flourishing Colony. Worst case
scenario, of course. After all, there aren't that many Interrupts you'd
desperately want to play on your opponent's turn. One notable exception is
Q2, which your opponent can force you to use on her turn unless of course
you'd rather lose your events to Kevins. Brain Drain is another one, it just
doesn't help too much if played on your turn.

So what is Frigid really good for? It's a nasty threat that adds a "casting
cost" to some of the better interrupts that can really screw with your
ability to overcome dilemmas and/or do missions. One or three of them in an
otherwise well-balanced Q-Continuum can give your opponent a few unusable
cards - regardless whether she decides to trigger the effect or rather hold
back with her interrupts. Maybe not the best Q-card, but a psych effect that
can give your opponent a headache when confronted with the decisions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Frigid + Kevin Uxbridge on something really important. Great Q2
   defence.
 * Almost forgot: Frigid + Dead in Bed. OUCH !!!

And now for the promised IE3 preview:

There will be 8 reviews, from #333 to #340. But, as I have received many
great suggestions, I will not publish only 8 but 24 cards! The top 8 will be
the real COTDs (and members of the elusive Internet Expansion), but I'll put
two more ideas at the bottom of each issue, without comments and just
because they almost made it, after all, ranking 24th in a 120+ entry contest
is not that bad.

BTW, to wet your mouths a little more, the 8 that made it are 2 Interrupts,
1 Mission, 1 Event/Artifact pair, 1 Doorway, 1 Personnel, 1 Dilemma and 1
Outpost! Yeah, that means about everything except a ship. Okay, that's
enough for now...

Hi, folks,

here's another shamelessly STCCGified Magic card...


    @{b}HEISENBERG COMPENSATORS@{ub}


    Event, uncommon QC.

Plays on table. While in play, nullifies Alien Probe and all draw decks are
turned face up. OR Nullifies another Heisenberg Compensators card (discard
both).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah, Field of Dreams, true even to the point of getting rid of Revelation
aka Alien Probe. Now there's one problem. In Magic these two cards are very
similar but have an important difference: They are of opposing colors.
Whereas STCCG does not know such stuff as green or blue Mana. So why do we
need this weaker version of Alien Probe? Actually there is a reason. Alien
Probe was broken. Really broken. Combined with the Telepathic Alien
Kidnappers that meant your opponent had to discard his best card every turn.
And because this combo was so broken, it got banned for tournaments.

Now the Heisenbergs are just the (almost correctly executed - see below)
card incarnation of a ruling I once suggested for that combo: Namely that
for the TAK guess, you pick up your hand, shuffle, resolve the guess and put
it back down. And Heisenberg does just that. Any attentive player will
pretty soon know most of his opponent's cards. And to speed your information
gathering, you can always use a Lifeform Scan, especially for those oponents
who keep the worst card of their initial draw on their hand to avoid real
certainty.

Basically we do now have an Alien Probe equivalent that exposes the con
tents of players' hands (with a little memory effort) without breaking TAK.
Result: A tournament-playable Alien Probe without the blatant rules problem.

Or is it? There still is a certain other card called Subspace Schisms. While
at first glance not as broken as Alien Probe / TAK (You have to sacrifice a
card for each card of your opponent you want to get rid of), this is a badly
abusable combo. Put a Heisenberg in your Q's tent and stock several Subspace
Schisms (about 5-7) and a Lifeform Scan or two. On the first turn, play a
Tent to get the Heisenbergs and put it on the table. And then...
...the rest of this shall be left to the reader. It is degenerate. If you
execute it correctly, your opponent will never ever be able to do any
mission unless he has a great initial draw. Solution tomorrow.

Dear Decipher guys, this card is broken. Awfully broken. Please do something
about it - this is worse than TAK / Alien Probe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * This can't be called a favorite - it's a game-killer.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #333@{ub}


Hi, folks,

with three threes in the number I can't do anything different than start
round three of the Internet Expansion. (This doesn't mean you'll have to
wait for COTD #4444 to get IE4 ;-) )

Okay, to it. Today's "official" Internet expansion card or rather cards
(these two belong together):

Author: Stephen Hopkins
8th place / 18 points

    @{b}PARALLEL UNIVERSES@{ub}


    Event

You must have Ninth Place Trophy on table. Allows all players to play
infinite numbers of duplicate personnel/ships. If destroyed, the orginal and
duplicate cards are removed from play. AU Icon.

@{i}"Rifts in the fabric of time/space can cause alternate universes to
combine."@{ui}


    @{b}NINTH PLACE TROPHY@{ub}

    Artifact

Play immediately on table, all Klingons lose honor if present OR Place in
hand until played on table as an event (parallel universe can be played
later). AU Icon.

@{i}"Events in paralled universes don't follow the same path. In one, Worf
didn't when the Bat'elth Championship, but came in ninth."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ultimate rich kid cards. No more limits on unique stuff, just lots and
even larger lots of personel. About as powerful as Supernova / Tox Uthat and
thus well justified in the game balance aspect. However, I am a little
sceptical about how you much you can actually gain from adding extra copies
of unique personnel to your crews. A good amount of diversification is vital
to any successful STCCG personnel strategy and you won't find too many
places in your deck for extras. Maybe two or three, but an Artifact and two
card plays for that ?

One might also have to consider the high risk involved when playing these,
as a single Kevin can get you into bad trouble, as you won't have too much
fun with your 3 Datas when they suddenly all wind up in your discard pile.

Two of the best cards to use with the combo are Lal and Mordock, the former
nearly being a clone card (thus highly versatile) and the latter helping you
to really quickly rack up points. But I am still sceptical. I like the
concept (we all know there is a clone machine in the makings, so something
will be done someday and this pair sets us thinking how much there actually
is to be gained), but I can imagine few really great decks that would have
to rely on having multiples of any unique crewmember in play.

Last thing: The secondary ability of that Artifact. It's a kewl and powerful
Klingon hoser. As Klingons have so much Honor, most red decks will make
heavy use of that skill. Cards like Honor Challenge become unusable and the
Klingon player will have a hard time doing his missions. Placed in Q's Tent
with a Q's Planet, this card makes for a powerful anti-Klingon measure, the
Klingon player will definitely need the appropriate counter-card in his
Q-Tent (I'll assume there would be one, otherwise Klingon decks would be
rather unplayable...)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * These two + Lals + Mordocks + Mission with multiple skill requirements.
   Lots of points and skills.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A word on the ratinx: Several raters have voted but forgot the rating
numbers. In this case, I'll translate a 0 point vote into a 3.0, a vote of 1
into a 5.5, a 2 becomes 7.5, a 3 becomes 9.0 and the rare 4 point votes
translate into a 10.

Hi, folks,

before I get even more questions on that: No, I don't know either where to
get Internet Expansion packs because, bluntly put, they do not exist. These
cards are a collection of the best Dream Cards from the 'net and yes, I
think those Decipher guys read this stuff ;-)

Okay, with that being out of the way, let's continue our Internet Expansion
III business with the second (and last) card pair submission:

Author: Matt Kerrigan
7th place / 18 points


    @{b}COMMANDER PICARD@{ub}


    Personnel,Romulan/Federation,Rare.

    Integrity 9
    Cunning 8
    Strength 6

    Officer.
    *Romulan: Diplomacy, Archaeology, Navigation.
    *Federation: Music, Leadership, Honor.
    All attributes +3 if Subcommander Data present.Command Star(*),AU icon.

@{i}"While JEAN-LUC PICARD was on Romulus he had to disguise as a Romulan.
Assisted Spock to unite Romulus and Vulcan."@{ui}


    @{b}SUBCOMMANDER DATA@{ub}


    Personnel,Romulan/Federation,Rare.

    Integrity 7
    Cunning 12
    Strength 12

    Officer.
    *Romulan, Computer Skill, Engineer, Exobiology.
    *Federation,Computer Skill,AstroPhysics,Music.Command Star(*), AU icon.

@{i}"While DATA was on Romulus he had to disguise as a Romulan. Stood out in the
crowd."@{ui}

(Note: The CAPS in the lore mean boldfaced, i.e. persona rule)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A cute couple and well designed. Essentially, Matt has split Picard and Data
in halves, one suited to be Romulan, one for Federation. Look at the skills,
if you'd add the skills of both affiliations, you'd get the original
complements. Thus, these cards are neither overpowered nor too weak. An
interesting thing happens when you check the space / planet suitability of
the skills. Our Captain is quite acceptable on planets when Fed and better
in space when Romulan, with Data, this is exactly reversed so the couple
will retain a similar overall power regardless of whether you play space or
planet missions.

The best place for these two Rakal-like duals is of course a Romulan deck
designed to also solve Federation missions by stealing them, although they
could also be well used as pure Romulans with still-decent skills and the
additional ability to suddenly mutate into musicians for a Ressikan Flute.
Just make sure that, whatever way you choose, you have enough non-aligned
support crew and non-aligned ships, too. (Actually, these two, with Rakal
and DeSeve would make a nice two-color deck basis - that deck would not have
a single pure Romulan or Federation character.)

The attribute burst on Subcmdr. Data ? I don't know, to be exact. Data has
such good attributes that he does not need the 3 extra points, but the odd
number 15 could prove to be rather painful in the context of Hunter Gangs.

Matt: You delivered a pair of well-thought and balanced cards. Good work!

    Event

Play's on ship. One personnel(Random choice) disabled for one turn. On next
turn, another personnel(Random choice) is disabled for one turn, etc.

    @{b}TO HELL WITH OUR ORDERS@{ub}


    Interrupt, rare

Plays on one Federation ship they may engage battle this turn and next but
lose 5 points OR Play on one ship where it may move triple range towards any
Borg Ship this turn. Ship may do nothing but chase after Borg Ship until
either ship destroyed, ship may attack Borg Ship if otherwise unable.

@{i}"During patrol of the Romulan neutral zone in 2373, Data expressed the crews
displeasure over their mission, while the rest of the federation engaged a
Borg ship."@{ui}

Maybe a little to powerful in conjunction with Borg ship to eliminate
opponent's ships... Also, a few characters too long in the game text (I
guess it would make an extra size card ;-) )

Hi, folks,

some more dreaming now that we can officially and graphically dream again by
sending our stuff to Decipher - yes, they made their Dream Card webpage a
reality! (Check out the first STCCG card over there...)

And here's today's dream being IE3'd:

Author: Tiree
6th place / 20 points


    @{b}TEMPORAL INVESTIGATIONS@{ub}


    Interrupt, uncommon, DS9

Play if opponent has played Horga'hn, Time Travel Pod, or Temporal Rift.
They skip their next turn. OR Return any Alternate Universe card to owners
hand.

@{i}"Starfleet's Temporal Investigations Bureau is called in to review possible
damage to the timeline by lengthy investigations. Poor sense of humor.
Always on time."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Tiree, I had to change one word on your card to avoid a
misunderstanding that is quite famous since the very first days of CCGs...
the playtest version of Magic's Time Walk read "Opponent loses next turn."
;-)

Actually, the Temporal Investigations Bureau proved to be quite inspiring as
I got three cards referring to that institution, two of them pretty similar
(and weaker), plus this here. The first function is practically a Temporal
Narcosis, but with two differences. You have different "side cards" next to
the Horga'hn and the function is different in multiplayer games as it is not
that you gain an extra turn but a target opponent fulfilling the condition
has to skip one turn.

As with the narcosis, you don't need the card in your hand when the opponent
uses the trigger card. Any time after the opponent uses one of the three
cards mentioned, you can call a Temporal Investigation and exploit the fact
that your opponent will now be somewhat paralyzed. If you could now get him
to use a Temporal Rift... BTW: You can use multiples of this on just one
Rift or Horga'hn.

But this is one of the cards that relies on your opponent doing something
specific to work. And most of these have a side use so the card won't
exactly be dead meat in your hand. So does this one, returning an AU card to
opponent's hand. And that's a pretty good side use considering that few
people actually play without AU stuff. One of the best targets is Lakanta,
just before your opponent tries to wrap around the edge of the spaceline.
Or, also not bad, Major Rakal when your opponent thinks he could use her to
snatch your Fed missions. And even better, if you have a good memory for
what Dilemmas you seeded where you might be able to get rid of the one
personnel your opponent would desperately have needed to pass a nasty
Dilemma on the mission he just foolishly attempted. Barclay's Disease might
do the job if you can just send his Beverly Picard back home... But that's
not all! There's a verrrrrry nasty use if your opponent happens to play the
wrong card. How do you think he will feel if you return his fully staffed
Future Enterprise, loaded with 11 crew members, conveniently parked at a
space location, to his hand? (His crew does not have space suits X-I )
That'll teach them to use Ultra-rares! Fair primary use, great side use if
you can pull it off. Cool card. (Captain, now you might understand why your
Temporal Investigation variant did not make it...)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Temporal Investigations + Opponent's Future Enterprise.

Plays on table. All personnel who are members of the Duras family (as
referenced in card lore) are now dual-affiliated Klingon/Romulan personnel.

@{i}"In 2367-68 The Duras Family was being aided by the Romulans during the

    @{b}BABEL VIRUS@{ub}


    Dilemma, Space, Rare DS9

Place on ship. Crew may no longer work together unless (Computer Skill OR

@{i}"Deep Space Nine encountered a virus left by the Cardassians which caused
the entire crew to speak in gibberish to each other."@{ui}

Author: Luke H.
5th place / 21 points


    @{b}IT'S NOT THAT EASY, CAPTAIN@{ub}


    Interrupt, Uncommon

Plays to add 20 points to total score needed to win OR stops any mission
attempt OR If Q's Planet on spaceline, transport all ships and personnel of
one affiliation of one player there. (May only be nullified by Q2)

@{i}"Often, Q wouldn't let his victims escape until he was fully entertained."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A funny and powerful stalling card. Regardless of which of the three
functions you want to apply, the basic idea is to make the game slower for
your opponent and thus this card is a great counter for speed decks that
quickly run out of breath.

First function: Increase the target score to win for both players. This is
much like a Q's planet, only a little weaker, but easier to play as you can
just stick it into your deck. Especially if used in multiples, this is a
good addition to decks that build momentum rather slowly, like Colony decks.

The second, very basic use is to stop any away team during a mission
attempt. While basically fulfilling one of the purposes usually covered by
using a lone Rogue Borg in space, this interrupt also provides this ability
on a planet. But this is not the only use, as you can also use this card as
a (desperately needed) OOPS card when you have just hit a love interest or
killer dilemma that got rid of your key personnel and you now fear something
like a Barclay's Disease. (ETA function).

Lastly, in the case you are already playing with Q's planet (thus rendering
the first function less useful), you can use this beauty as a Mass Wormhole
with a predefined exit. Again, you can use it on an opponent's ships for
stalling or on your own to get yourself into a better position.

Overall, correctly employed, this card does provide a high amount of
versatility and duplicates the key function of four other cards which
because of their limited scope see little play - Q's planet, ETA, Rogue Borg
and Wormhole. In all 4 cases, the function is however limited in some way so
the card is not overpowered. A flexible and cool addition to many stall
decks or just slower decks. Good work, Luke!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plays on any away team at a planet mission. If away team has one or more
VIP, randomly select 1 VIP to die. Immune to Amanda Rogers

@{i}"V.I.P.'s are likely targets for enemies. Capt. Janeway hosted a meeting
with delegates from different Kazon factions when there was an assassination
attempt on them."@{ui}

If VIPs were used more often, this could easily have been a card in the real
IE3, but although I loved the idea very much, the all too limited
application field of this card prevented it from snatching a higher rank.
(Tom, maybe you'll want to resubmit this for IE4 with a little more punch -
but don't make it too strong either)

Hi, folks,

one more before we get to distributing the medals... the only one from a
rater that made it...

Author: Mot the Barber
4th place / 21.25 points


    @{b}QUANTUM FILAMENT@{ub}


Dilemma, Space, rare

Unless 3 Navigation present, ship is struck by a quantum filament. Mission
continues, but the crew is divided into teams (your choice) equal to the
number of seed cards remaining. The teams will enocunter one seed card each.

@{i}"The USS Enterprise was struck by a quantum filament in 2368, damaging
systems all over the ship. The crew faced numerous ordeals in isolated
groups before repairs could be made."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Dilemma can easily be a nasty one if you have the right things to
combine it with. Everything that requires high attribute totals are prime
choices. A Nagilum or Temporal Causality Loop are just two possibilities.

However, it is not too easy to use. If you look at it, you will at least
three seed cards to be effective (The filament plus at least two more so
there is something to split the team into.) Four is more like it, to prevent
redshirting one of the two Dilemmas with a single ENGINEER (the only really
dangerous thing here is Cosmic String Fragment which would kill the entire
ship; nearly all other things can only kill the redshirt, damage the ship or
may be cured later when the crew is reunited. But the real fun starts when
you try combining Dilemmas. A Microbiotic Colony is not a big threat.
Neither is Gravitic Mine. Or Nanites. However, if you force your opponent to
split his crew in three, you stand a good chance that at least two of these
three do hit. Which means BOOM! - Goodbye ship...

So we have a Dilemma with a hard to beat requirement and a potentially
devastating effect. Seems too strong ? No. You need three or four cards to
execute a good combo, and at this number, you can get similarly nasty
combinations out of the existing Dilemmas. Plus, it's space only and you
can't afford to seed all six missions with a four-card combo, so the best
you can achieve is to lock up one or two missions.

But, there's another IE3 card (not yet published, it's among the top 3)
which is the purrrfect combination card for this. (And no, there was no
cooperation effort I'd know of)...

would force Decipher to find a very small font...

Author:RockoLuvr
3rd place/22 points


    @{b}MIRROR UNIVERSE DOOR@{ub}


Doorway, Ultra-Rare

Plays on table any time during your turn. When played, select one ship or
away team in play. They are immune to all changes. Call out a number < 7.
That number is the number of your full turns that all changes will remain in
effect. All personnel and ships are changed as follows: All personnel's
integrity numbers become their cunning, their cunning becomes their
strength, and their strength becomes their integrity. All personnel with AU
icons lose them, and those without gain them. All dual-affiliation personnel
become the affiliation not listed on their card. They may choose either
skill set to retain while Mirror Universe Door is in play. All ships'
weapons and shields numbers are switched. All missions, dilemmas, and
artifacts are changed as follows: Any reference to an affiliation (either by
text or icons) are changed so that Federation becomes Non-Aligned,
Non-Aligned becomes Klingon, Klingon becomes Romulan, and Romulan becomes
Federation. Cannot be nullified or closed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uh-ouch! This card can heavily screw with everybody's ability to do any
missions. First the simple effects. A global Mask of Korgano plus a so-so
attribute modifier. Not that much gameplay effect except that Cryo payloads
are suddenly misseeds (they no longer have an AU icon) and the Feds are the
new prime targets for Firestorms.

Next, the dual affiliation personnel. These are obviously badly screwed as
very few players play a three-affiliation deck and they no longer match any
of their surrounding affiliations. And with the way the mission affiliations
change, Major Rakal and her friends won't even be able to solve any
now-Klingon missions (except for Qualor II which now also should be read as
"all non-Klingon...") seeded by her player, after all, that player will
probably be playing R/F.

But the heaviest problem is the fact that now all missions are off-color for
their respective players. Romulans might have the easiest time with their
ability to espionage the now-Federation missions, Feds might at least
achieve something if they have solid non-aligned support (who hasn't?) but
our Klingon friends are absolutely paralyzed (how are they to espionage
against Romulans???)

Which leads us to the best application of this card: Drop it into a Romulan
Fedspionage deck and play a healthy amount of non-aligned crew (at least 60%
of your personnel cards). If your opponent plays Fed, you can solve his now
N-A missions, if he's a Rommie too, you can espionage against any mission
and if he's a Klingon you have a very easy time stealing his missions. And
in any case, unless your opponent also has some Espionage capability, he'll
be completely stalled. (Oh, there might be an even better application in the
future: Play one of the new affiliations to come. They are unaffected and
your oppo- nent is the only one who gets screwed.)

So far so good. Now please somebody tell me how to fit the entire text on a
card.

19th place/3rd round card


    @{b}MERCHANTS@{ub}


    Event, Common

Play on table. Each player must place a card from their draw deck OR Q's
tent face up with MERCHANTS. At the end of every turn that player may buy a
card from the MERCHANTS by replacing the chosen card with a card from their
hand. Nullified by THE DEVIL (not duplicatable)

@{i}"In the 24th century there are still a large number of merchants who

A great idea, but the card tracing involved is pretty heavy and as there are
only two (usually soon pretty bad) cards to choose from, there won't be too
much of a game effect.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #339@{ub}


Hi, folks,

like the first Internet Expansion, this one does again have the ultimate
question... Did a certain Wesley make a card that the raters placed higher
than all others? Or do the creative forces of the Internet win the struggle
and make a card that's even better?
Last time I lost...
This time...

...too !

2nd place/25.50 points


    @{b}ACADEMY SIMULATION@{ub}


    Mission, All affiliations, space, uncommon.

    Span 2, Points X.

    Requirements: Youth. No artifacts allowed here.

    X=15 * number of Dilemmas overcome.

@{i}"Fleet Academy Simulator Room: Pass the final Academy exam"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This card can easily change the course of an entire game, but it is complex
and risky enough to be a lot of fun (and not overpowered, as we will soon
see). Also, it provides us with a few opportunities to use some of the other
IE cards to a good purpose, but that later...

Of course the person seeding this mission will want to score big here. So
she'll use at least 3 Dilemmas, more probably 5 or 6, in the hope of scoring
the big 100 in one swipe. Which leaves her opponent with a lot of breathing
room under his missions, after all almost a third of the freely usable seed
cards (30 minus missions, outpost, doorways) could end up here, thus
reducing the average Dilemma number under the opponent's missions from 3 to
2.

And then there's the more than risky situation that the mission can be done
by every affiliation. Which basically means if you seed it with too easy
Dilemmas, you'll actually give your opponent an advantage. Of course, your
opponent will add a Dilemma or two of his own, but he's informed of what he
added, while the person using the Simulation obviously isn't. So basically
your best bet is using medium power Dilemmas with a theme (like all
requiring MEDICAL or ENGINEER) in the hope of keeping your opponent
guessing.

Of course, your opponent hopefully doesn't sleep during the seed phase
either and now has several cool counterspells...

   * Very effective: Q. Either it's overcome and all Dilemmas are nullified
     (thus reducing the score to a measly 15) or you get the benefit of the
     rearranged spaceline.
   * Also cool: A powerful Wall Dilemma or one that stops and has hard
     requirements. Seed that early so that it's encountered last and your
     opponent has to watch his carefully prepared 90 points drain away -
     she'll have to make a new attempt next turn, so the Dilemmas are not
     overcome during the attempt where the mission was solved. 0 points...
   * Same bottom line: A late-encountered Yuta hopefully getting rid of the
     last Youth.
   * Kill the entire crew: Just throw a Quantum Filament (Mot's IE3
     contribution) their way! With all these Dilemmas, they'll mostly have
     to face them one person per card.
   * Yet better killer: A single Mirror Universe (COTD #100, from "Internet
     Expansion Zero".) Reverses all Dilemma conditions. So much for the
     carefully prepared crew...
   * Oh, speaking of Mirror Universe: Why don't you seed one and attempt the
     mission yourself with Kell + K'Chiq (choose Youth as skill)? There's no
     Dilemma these two could do normally, so there's none they can't do in
     the Mirror Universe situation... (But watch out for a second Mirror
     Universe in the stack, negative minus equals plus ;-) )
   * Also a good guess: Outpost Raid. The user of Academy Simulation is
     going for the quick victory, so where's the most probable Outpost
     location? Right.

You see, lots of strategic options. A single card drawing lots of attention.
And the wisest choice in play might be to leave it alone and go for the
(consequently not very heavily seeded) other missions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Academy Simulation + (any 5 hard Dilemmas) + Mirror Universe. Might
   make for a very fast win.
 * Opponent's Academy Simulation + Quantum Filament. Does not only void
   the Mirror Universe combo by splitting the crew but also turns them all
   into poor doomed redshirts...

Hi, folks,

well, what more? After seeing pretty everything in the three Internet
expansions, there has to be a twist to this round's winner... Well, we had
Personnel, Ships and Artifacts. We also saw Equipment, Events and
Interrupts. Heck, even a Mission or two! But we still lack one category...
...an Outpost!

[A WHAT?????]

Yeah, right! This round of IE design was won by somebody designing an
outpost!!! (Almost as improbable as scoring 100 points with Mot the Barber)

    @{b}SMUGGLER'S PARADISE@{ub}


    Outpost, Neutral, common

    Shields 14

No Federation Personnel allowed here. During seed phase may be seeded with
up to three Personnel/Ship cards. May be seeded only at pure Non-Aligned
Missions.

@{i}"Meeting point of outlaws and dishonest traders. Favorite hangout of people
like Kivas Fajo"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Sorry Ralf, I somehow lost the mail with your lore, so I placed something
similar. If you want, send me the correct one and I'll update it on the
Archive Page)

Oh, well, so simple. And when I read it, I again had to think of a Magic
card. But in this case not any cheapo card, but THE card. The Black Lotus.
For a cost of nothing, you get three of the thing you need most to get a
quick game start. However, unlike the Lotus, this one has serious
limitations to balance its power.

First, you can't use it with Feds. Feds have the speed advantage and the
freedom of having three near-identical personnel for every function, so you
can build your decks around that. And Fed decks win a lot because of this.
The Smuggler's Paradise compensates for this advantage by giving the other
affiliations a few decent cards to start with (at the cost of three less
"real" seed cards). Usually these would be a ship and two good crew. And
the ship might be a K'Vort class or a Tama, these require only two icons to
move. Now let's have a look at the balance. The best Feds have an average of
4.5 skills per person. The others have about 3. Let's assume you seed two
crew with 4 each (some of your best). Furthermore, both players draw around
4 crew in their opening hand. So the user of the Smuggler's Outpost has a
potential 20 skills on table after playing the 4 crew, the Feddie has about
18. So still an advantage, but smaller than you might think.

Add to this the fact that this outpost is quite easily destroyed by a
non-Fed player (C'mon, SHIELDS 14? Two K'Vorts and a Bynars'!) thus
offsetting the 8 skill advantage when playing this against another red or
green guy and you come pretty close to a good balance already.

And the last thing: You have to seed this at a non-aligned mission. Which
means Qualor II. And that again means you won't have too much of a chance
to attempt this from your outpost early unless you're playing a lot of
non-aligned crew. So you will have to move somewhere else negating the
Outpost Mission speed bonus (often 1 turn).

A refreshing, totally new idea, a non-broken but still powerful "Black
Lotus"-type card that makes the early game more interesting, a card for
non-Fed players only AND a lot of Trek Sense all in one card. Ralf, you
deserve this one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Smugglers' Paradise + Tama + Dathon + Roga Danar. Add an early
   Captain's Log and start wreaking havoc!

It's funny to see a few very low ratings here... When Magic first came out,
people saw the Lotus and said "Oh, come on, three mana and just once, what
good can it be?". And it was one of the cheapest cards in the set. Then,
later, people realized how good a fast start is. And I always get this
pattern when I review a card that adds speed unless for the few extreme ones
(Red Alert and kin). The less obvious ones tend to get overlooked...

A bit hazy in the game text, but basically a reusable Near-Warp Transport.
However at Range 5 the proton torpedo case K'Ehleyr traveled in might have
been the better representation for the ability.

Hi, folks,

now that we've seen a number of good ideas (from the players), let's look at
a not-so-good idea (from Decipher) for a change.


    @{b}DR. Q, MEDICINE ENTITY@{ub}


    Q-Interrupt, common QC.

Diagnosis: One of your Event cards on the spaceline (opponent's choice) is
the problem.
Treatment: Opponent must move the "problem card" to a different appropriate
spaceline location.

@{i}"'Well, well, well. What seems to be the problem?'"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, at first glance this is really neat. You get to take a card played by
your opponent and use it as if it were your own. But first let's look at
what this card cannot do.

   * Steal a Kurlan Naiskos. You betcha. Getting a Naiskos from your
     opponent would have been a reason to actually use this. Unfortunately
     the new FAQ makes a clear distinction between Events and Artifacts
     played as Events :-(
   * Move a Supernova. Well, actually, you can do it. But it won't do
     anything. The effect of Supernova takes place at the time it goes off
     and after this there's nothing to change that (except for Temporal
     Causality Loop, but you'd be hard pressed to ever see that in a game).
     So you move the card without effect. Great deal.
   * Steal the kewl stuff opponents tend to play on ships. Plasma Fire might
     qualify. Unfortunately this card states you must move the Event "to an
     appropriate spaceline location". A ship is not a spaceline location in
     game terms, so you'll be unable to move the Plasma Fire to any place.
   * Score five points by moving Mot's Advice and declaring it to be cool.
     Again, the card does not play on a location. Now what can you do ?
     There are a few Events you can move. Distortion Field. Tetryon Field.
     Q-Net. Espionages. Atmospheric Ionization. Drought Tree.

Well, the last one won't help you as you'll have to move it to another
mission your opponent has completed and the points will stay where they are.
The only remote chance that this might become useful are that you'd have a
nullifier there (away team or John Doe with Transfiguration). The others?
Moving an Espionage can slow your opponent. If he plays with any of them,
that is. The Beaming preventers and Tetryon Field: Never seen one on play.
Leaves us with Q-Net. Best option. But that means you have a one-shot Drag
Net. GRRREAT. Um, not quite.

BTW: The game text has some flavor, but it was quite confusing to me when I
read it for the first time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Not even a witty way to say "none".

(*) I don't average these ratings. Many of them arrived before people had
seen the new FAQ and include the possibility of moving a Naiskos. As this is
no longer valid, the ratings are also partially void. So, no average this
time.

Hi, folks,

let's take a stab at this:


    @{b}ZON@{ub}

    Personnel, non-aligned, rare QC.

    Integrity    2
    Cunning      4
    Strength    11

    SECURITY, OFFICER, Treachery, Guaramba, May nullify Nausicaans where
    present. Command Star (*), AU Icon.

@{i}"Nausicaan officer who stabbed young Jean-Luc Picard through the heart in a
brawl at Starbase Earhart on 2327. Dom-Jot player."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And yet another dual classification. But this one won't help you much. Yes,
SECURITY is okay, but what do you want to do with an OFFICER? Actually, not
much. Except that this OFFICER is like a mini-Leadership to avoid the "Worf
problem" (the fact that our favorite Klingon won't be able to beat Wesley in
hand-to-hand combat). And that leads us directly to Zon's main application
area: Away team battles. A Strength of 11 is not bad to start with, he can
battle alone and he makes it much harder for your opponent to initiate
battle against you so you maintain better control about who gets to battle
whom and when.

So where do I put this Nausicaan guy? In a Klingon deck? Nope. Not in a
Romulan deck either. Rather, I'll throw that guy into a Federation deck!

You'll ask "Has he gone crazy?"(no) or "Is he drunk today?"(no). I'm sane
and sober. The best surprise value is a strong battle hidden component
hidden away in an oh-so-peaceful Federation deck. Roga Danar, Zon and two
Soong-Type Androids (one each MEDICAL and SCIENCE) mean 43 points of
Strength, are useful enough also as Dilemma-solving crew and you'll hit your
opponent unprepared. Beyond that, our good Zon is pretty useless. Treachery
might in rare cases help if you're playing Fed, but the rest isn't just
worth it. A rather average SECURITY with a sometimes deadly weakness in
Integrity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Zon + Roga Danar + STAs for some serious butt-kicking in Fed decks

Hi, folks,

this card is cool. Like Ice Cold Lemonade...


    @{b}LEMON-AID@{ub}


    Q-Interrupt, common. If you are at least 20 points ahead of your opponent,
    graciously give this card to your opponent, who scores [5] bonus points.
    (May not be nullified.)

@{i}"'Wasn't it your own Hardy that said Nothing reveals humanity so well as
the games it plays? ...Actually, you reveal yourself best in how you
play.'"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, this is a card a good player would never get a use out of. Just
because a good player is never behind in points... (Certain games against a
certain Locutus don't count, okay?) ;-)

Well, actually this happens to the best of us. The other player plays a fast
deck, (Fed space or so) and gets a good start. Big points very early. So
while he's screaming through your dilemmas, you could as well profit a
little from it with the occasional Lemon-Aid. Ater the first mission your
opponent will be ahead far enough that the card can go into effect, so every
mission thereafter scores you 5 if you have enough of these in your deck.

Wait a sec... Did I say every mission after the first? Well, that's the
second and third (unless he's playing a really weird mission selection or
you have a few serious point drainer dilemmas seeded somewhere). But at the
third, it won't help you too much as your opponent will usually win with
that one. So you get a net benefit of 5 points from the card. 10 points for
the differential at a tournament. Not exactly the biggest score boost I've
seen in this game. But almost free...

I wouldn't go too far out of my way to include Lemon-Aid in a tourney deck,
but one or two might be okay for the occasional nasty surprise (and they do
have some psych value). Now it would be fun to be able to taunt your
opponent with "Come on, attempt that mission" while having a score of 95,
but how is your opponent to be 20 points ahead of you in that case (while
still allowing you to win by reaching an exact 100)? Drat...

Hi, folks,

maybe it's time for a green guy again. Actually, scratch that "maybe" part,
if I think about it.


    @{b}TELAK@{ub}


    Personnel, Romulan, uncommon QC.

    Integrity   5
    Cunning     6
    Strength    9

    SECURITY, Treachery, Tal Shiar, Cybernetics. Staff Star (+).

@{i}"Male bodyguard of Sela. Stationed on Romulus. Lieutenant operative in the
Tal Shiar's new Android Research section."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seems simple, but the card isn't that bad. Because until now the Romulans
had no unique SECURITY at all. Their only choices (besides resorting to
non-aligned crew) were Taul (Treachery, Archaeology) and Jaron (Geology,
Youth). And both had a severe drawback: Integrity 4. Which means, that even
counting non-aligned crew, the Romulans had no SECURITY that could survive a
Firestorm except for that hard to get Roga Danar. So the equation for them
was simple: Get Roga or be sure the Firestorm / Barclay's Disease combo gets
your entire crew. One of the rare cases where an attribute point can
actually prove to be an asset for an affiliation.

Well, on to the next problem Romulans have. Where are those dual
classification people? Apart from the two new ones in QC, there's only
Mirok. Wow. So the prime Rommie problem always was to get the needed
classifications for Dilemmas. But now there's a card that can supply
classifications at will: The Soong-Type Android. Isn't it convenient to have
a card that allow you to get them out faster, too?

Okay, we talked about Romulan disadvantages. How about a Romulan advantage?
They have good big ships and strong crews and can battle. Unless your
opponent plays Romulan, too. Hmmm. Wasn't there some skill called Tal Shiar?
Forget that restriction.

And that's it. Treachery needn't be mentioned. But otherwise, a decent
support card that fixes a few Romulan problems. Nothing to write home about,
but it especially helps the not-so well equipped player, as it rids you of
troubles that would be most obvious had you to play with litle or no rares.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Telak + 4 Soong-type Androids as your opening play. Did that Fed player

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #345@{ub}


Hi, folks,

here's one more old man ;-)


    @{b}PAUL MANHEIM@{ub}

    Personnel, non-aligned, rare QC

    Integrity 7
    Cunning   9
    Strength  2

    SCIENCE, Where present, may nullify Manheim's Dimensional Door OR double its
    effect. Astrophysics x2, Staff Star (+)

@{i}"Reclusive scientist who experimented with nonlinear time. Traveled to other
dimensions, of which he said words paled 'because the images were so
vibrant'."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plain rude. There's that one card that speeds up the game so much and here's
the one that makes it even better. But before I get to that effect, there's
another thing to mention about this guy. Namely that he has an implicit
affiliation preference with his skils. Astrophysics is quite rare, but as
rare is the need for a multiple Astrophysics skill. Klingons have none at
all (what would they want from a Strength 2 weakling anyway ;-) ), Rommies
have the one on Shattered Space (Astro x2 plus three other skills for a 45 -
not so great), but the Feds have Investigate Disappearancce which they can
now conveniently solve with the two guys who fiddled with time - Manheim and
good old Wesley. So a little biased our good Paul...

Next thing. He has skills suitable for a space deck and a special ability
that requires a planet. Hmmm. Either you stock a planet mission or you rely
on your opponent using some planets (possibly adding a Q's planet to your
Q-Continuum to be sure). Or you go with the planets and just use his Astro
as a backup for Restore Errant Moon.

Okay, the Manheim Door thing. You can kill it or double it as you please.
You can even double it for some time and then choose to nullify it later.
(it won't work the other way round unless you have multiple doors in your
deck ;-) ) So the type of deck that benefits most from it is the fast
event-laden Fed deck. Just don't play those Kevins and Amandas unless you
have an extra one. You just hold on to them and wait for your opponent to
nix an Event or two on your side. Then your deck really starts rolling at
two Events plus personnel and ships (you do have a Red Alert, don't you ?)
per turn if you're lucky. Make a few of those Events Kivas Fajos to get
extra cards. Then, when you have enough cards on the table (like all of your
deck but 1 card in your draw deck), start playing Q-Tents for random
retrieval to avoid running out of cards and solve a few missions. Very fast
win if you get it to work.

Hi, folks,

here's something really honorable for our red friends...


    @{b}K'NERA@{ub}


    Personnel, Klingon, uncommon QC.

    Integrity  6
    Cunning    7
    Strength   7

    OFFICER, SECURITY, Transporter Skill, Honor. Scores 5 points when Korris or
    Konmel killed in battle. Command Star (*).

@{i}"Pursued the criminals Korris and Konmel in 2364 until their deaths on the
U.S.S. Enterprise. Offered Worf a position in the Klingon Defense Force."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, a truly honorable Klingon. But he can make for a less than honorable
victory. Like a missionless deck!

How ? First, you'll need to do some trading if you really want it to work
because you'll want to have 10 each of Korris and Konmel. The rest of the
draw deck should consist of 8 Rogue Borg and you'll need Lore Returns, Red
Alert, the Traveler and a ship. Use powerful Dilemmas in your seed deck as
you'll need about 12-14 turns. Also, put the key cards in a Q's Tent and use
tents from your draw deck to get them. Report K'Nera and one of the
treacherous Klingons. Play the ship, the Red Alert and the Traveler for card
drawing. Next, beam the traitor to the ship and play 3 RB on it. (or 1 plus
Crosis). Score 5 for eliminating your man. Play Lore returns, beam K'Nera to
the planet, the RB to the Outpost and then K'Nera to the ship. Now you'll
want to reinforce your RB to get a STRENGTH of 16 or higher (4 RB or 2 plus
Crosis). Your turns now consist of reporting Korris and Konmel and waiting
until they're both killed (two RB attacks per turn). You also score 10 for
that. Repeat until you are at 80. Then beam K'Nera to the planet where you
seeded a Sarjenka and Armus. Attempt the mission, get stopped (85), do one
more RB battle set (95) and die from Armus. Complete your victory with a
loud Death Yell.

The good thing ? Your opponent cannot do anything about this deck short of
blowing up your outpost or ship. Which will require a lot of weapon power.
Bad thing ? It's not that fast and a good deck will beat it by sheer speed
(Stock Jamaharon or the Devil against Horga'hns).

[Hey Wes, this is not DOTW, you want to talk about single cards]

Oops, sorry, but that was the only thing I could say about this card. After
all, who's interested in OFFICER, SECURITY, Honor and Transporter Skill
anymore ? Also, I didn't talk about a deck but about a 73-card combo (60+13)

Hi, folks,

sorry for the latest drop in COTD frequency but setting up the STCCG Online
stuff has kept me busier than I'd like it. Anyway, it's working now
(although I already had to make a harsh ruling against a misbehaved player),
so here I am again. (Addicts should carefully check for withdrawal symptoms
before reading this issue and consider taking a small dosage first...)


    @{b}MONA LISA@{ub}


    Artifact, rare QC.

Use as Equipment card. If destroyed, the player directly causing the
destruction (if any) loses [-25] points. (Not duplicatable.)

@{i}"Priceless original oil painting by ancient Earth scientist Da Vinci. Stolen
from the Louvre in 2243. Recovered from the collection of Kivas Fajo in
2366."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, a beautiful card. I'll give it that much. But that's about it. It might
even have made for a good Event or Equipment, but as an Artifact? Artifacts
are supposed to be powerful and this one is not.

While a 25 point loss is severe, you'll have to consider the circumstances
under which it will take effect. You will have to get your opponent to
destroy the Mona Lisa. That means either it will have to be the unfortunate
target of a Disruptor Overload or it will have to be aboard some ship or
outpost that is being destroyed.

Let's take the ship / outpost thing first. To get any effect from the
Artifact, you'll have to play against a battle deck. We all know how common
battle decks are. And when someone plays them, they are out for a very quick
destruction of your outpost or crew-laden ship in order to attempt a few
missions after that with their slower-than-average solving capability. So
once on the ship (or even Outpost), the Mona Lisa actually poses a threat to
this kind of deck, especially in a tournament where the difference between a
110-50 win and an 85-50 win is crucial. However the trouble is you'll need
the Mona Lisa very early to get a good use out of it. And there's the
Artifact problem again. You just don't usually have 3rd turn Artifacts
(except with the Q's Planet strategy which works surprisingly often...) and
if you do, you'd probably want a Gift Box or Horga'hn.

And the Anti-Disruptor Overload effect ? Yes, it might discourage your
opponent from playing that card if you're using an equipment-heavy deck. But
Equipment-dependent decks are rare enough that you won't usually see more
than one Overload against you (and that one probably from a Q's Tent). And
in this case I'd rather Palor my Equipment than wasting my time with the
Mona Lisa.

And last try to do something cool: If your opponent plays with "Are these
truly your friends. Brother?", put a Mona Lisa in your Q's Tent. Draw it and
find a way to discard it. Then hit a Q-Flash and hope for the best...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Mona Lisa + Opponent's "Are these truly..."
 * (c)Tebok: Mona Lisa + Conundrum. Might actually work. Once in ten years.

Hi, folks,

where did I leave off? Artifact? Oh well, can as well continue there...


    @{b}CANAR@{ub}


    Artifact, rare QC.

Immediately play on any female personnel. Specify one male personnel at a
different location. If these two personnel are ever present together,
discard both.

@{i}"A glowing device used by the Haliians to focus thoughts in a limited
empathic form. Especially used to strengthen an emotional link in love."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Artifact again has a specific flaw. And that is its first word. The
effect in itself is not that bad, there are many games in which your
opponent will try to get an urgent crew replacement to a team and you'd more
than just want to stop this tactical reinforcement. So as and of itself, the
effect is nearly as good as targeting two of your opponent's key personnel
and saying "Okay, choose which of the two becomes unusable." A few good
couples include Vash and Picard (against Hunt for DNA), Roga Danar and any
of the Tashas [1/2 -ldp] (be sure to find a Dilemma that requires 2 or more
SECURITY) and of course the ever-famous male SECURITY / female MEDICAL pairs
that make passing those Barclay's Diseases too esay for your opponent.

The effect is also geared towards mid-game or the later game, so making it
an Artifact won't hurt too much. That is, if you could just pick it up and
hold it in your hand until you see the right constellation and then
effectively take two good personnel (or at least one of them) owned by your
opponent out of the game.

But there's that nasty word "immediately". So you just can't time it that
precisely. R*ts...

Okay, but maybe we can find a use that is not as timing-dependent. Let's for
fun start targeting our own crew. Leave an expendable female at your
opponent's Investigate Time Continuum - his Data will sure be delighted
about it. Or against Evaluate Terraforming, target that Bev Crusher and
leave a Mot to greet her...

But even in these cases of "mission-blocking", you'll have to time it. Your
opponent might need a very short time between bringing that key person into
play and attempting the mission. Which again makes the acquisition of this
Artifact a nasty (and often resource-binding) task. Sorry, no. Had it been
"place on hand until played as an Event"..., it would have been a good
strategic tool in the hands of the experienced player. This way, it's too
hard to get it at the right moment.

Hi, folks,

one of the famous "divisible by 25" numbers is drawing near again, and I
have a special idea for this one (listed at the end, don't overlook it, you
might want to act fast)

But before, there's this "349" business to get rid of...


    @{b}KATE PULASKI@{ub}


    Personnel, Federation, rare QC.

    Integrity 7
    Cunning 7
    Strength 4

    MEDICAL, MEDICAL, SCIENCE, Suspends effect of Doppelganger where present,
    May only beam once per turn, Staff Star (+).

@{i}"Chief Medical Officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise in 2365. Dislikes
transporters and turbolifts."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three classifications? And a special ability? Wow. Would be really great,
were it not for that small area called restriction box. Beam only once per
turn. Suuure. Maybe we can make something of this, though.

In a planet deck, good Kate s*cks as long as you want to maintain any decent
speed. Remember, two turns per mission attempt. Seems a little slow to me.
But then, there are space decks and here Kate can really play her role as
The Great Dilemma Nullifier(TM). In space, no one can hear you beaming, you
usually stay on the ship and attempt your missions. And here the double
MEDICAL and a SCIENCE turn old Kate into a Vekor on steroids with the
additional advantage of being Thought Fire proof. She might not solve too
many missions, but she sure solves Dilemmas.

Leaves us with her special ability. Suspend Doppelganger where present. So
you get a cool defence against a card nobody plays. Unless you play it
yourself. Yes, the card works both ways and remember it's always the player
who moves that gets to keep her personnel. So we need Pulaski (with a skill
nobody needs), the Doppelganger (a card nobody plays with) and, just for
fun, let's throw in two more cards nobody plays with: The Type VI Shuttle
and Engage Shuttle Operations.
(Warning: this combo is powerful but it will not work unless you know
exactly that your opponent plays a Bridge Crew deck)

Put a Shuttle aboard your Enterprise. Play Pulaski on the Big E and add as
many Bridge Crew members as you can report. Fly towards your opponent's
Outpost (don't forget the Shuttle Operations along the way). Stop next to
the outpost (1 card away, preferably with a total RANGE of 6 or less for the
round trip to the outpost.) When your opponent reports some Bridge Crew,
load the equivalents on your shuttle, take a quick trip over, watch his guys
crumble and retreat, perfectly safe from your opponent attempting the same
thing (protected by Pulaski). Repeat ad Nauseam, then solve a mission or two
(if you're still capable of doing so after taking the very probable hits
from some hard objects against your head ;-) ).

And Pulaski will never have to beam during the entire story... A fair
support card for space decks, a cool (5 points) combo, a lousy card for
planet decks. Oh, well, you win some, you lose some.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Pulaski + Shuttle + Engage Shuttle Ops + Doppelganger. It's rude if
   nothing else...

Okay, and now for the #350. For once, I'd like to take a number off. Yes,
you heard right. I don't want to write COTD #350. So I'll skip it.

--WHAT?--

Yes, no #350. Forget it.

--THAT CAN'T BE TRUE!--

Okay, okay. You are so eager to get that one? Well, why don't you write it?
I'll give you until tomorrow, Tuesday, 5:30 pm EST to come up with a COTD
article. And as you'll want to have rated cards to work with, you can choose
one of these to write about...

   * Rager
   * Madred
   * Klingon Civil War
   * Data's Medals
   * Q'Vicious Animal Things
   * Investigate Legend.

The best article I get will become COTD #350. Rakals, Mots, Habibs and
Teboks need not apply ;-). Oh, and if I get no submissions, I won't be able
to publish a COTD #350, so power up that word processor! Submissions by
e-mail to crusher@kiss.de, but you knew that... (Just submit the article
text, I'll paste in the ratings...)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #350@{ub}


Hi, folks,

something is really wrong with that subject line. My little threat to skip
the issue has generated quite a few submissions and many of them were good.
Really, I could publish at least four good "guest issues" from what I got.

So let's restart this from the beginning (and this time correctly):

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        @{b}Sean Caulfield's STCCG card of the day #350@{ub}

Hi, folks,

seems he chose me to do this:


    @{b}INVESTIGATE LEGEND@{ub}


    Mission, F/K/R, Planet, Rare QC.
    40 Points, Span 4

    Youth x3 + (Diplomacy x2 OR Discard 2 Youth)
    Cloaks or Decloaks each time points are scored

@{i}"Aldea: Verify existence of fabled Utopian planet hidden by powerful
cloaking device"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, at first glance it seems like a good mission. Compliment 55-point
behemoth Hunt for DNA Program or 60-point Diplomatic Conference, and you've
got yourself a two-mission deck. Great for an all planet deck speed deck.

It's also easy to complete. Throw in 3 STA's and boom - you've got yourself
40 points. Or toss in ole baldy (Picard) and Wesley, Lal, and Rager (Or
Robin Lefer for the theme deck department:-).). The Rommies shouldn't have
too hard of a time either: Sela, D'Tan, Nick Locarno, and perhaps Marouk, or
some other diplomat. The Klingons might have a harder time, but how about
Dathon, Divok, Kareen Brianon, and a STA? So far so good.

Now comes the bad news, and there's a lot of it. The first is very obvious:
it's triple affiliation, which means your opponent could steal it. Probably
wouldn't have been feasible except for those d*ng STA's, so it's possible.

The second one is not quite as obvious, but it's a major dinger: the
cloaking stuff. Best case scenario, you beam down, complete it and get stuck
when it cloaks. Solution: use an Iconian Gateway. But that's very vulnerable
to Revolving Door, Kevin, and now Wrong Door. And plus, it'll waste letting
you seed and artifact there.

The second worst case scenario: the mission is cloaked and you can't beam
down. Easy solution: do another mission. Or better yet, do something "Cool"
:-).

Worst case scenario: you get stopped attempting the mission. If you've got
some of your better people down there, you're in deep manure. Your opponent
can stall you there by scoring points twice or not scoring at all. The best
you could do is attempt another mission with what you got left or do
something "Cool", though it may not feel so "cool" at the time. This is the
main dinger.

The least obvious downside is in the points (Yes, the points!). Think about
it this way: 40 points may sound good, but it's not quite as big of a
blessing as you may think. Unless you play with another 50+ point mission,
you're still going to have to do two other missions to win, so why not just
stick to 35ers, which require a whole lot less. In summary, it's a
looks-good-on-the-surface-but-not-so-hot-when-you-really-look-at-it type of
card :-). If you come prepared, it might be helpful, but you pretty much got
to design your deck around it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combos:

 * Investigate Legend + Jean-Luc Picard + Wesley Crusher + Lal (Armed with
   a classification and an extra Youth) = 40 points and 3 people trapped
   on a planet. :-|
 * Investigate Legend + Particle Fountain: One way to get off that planet
   quick :-).

Hi, folks,

okay, here's your favorite COTD author again in command (a little astonished
that Sean's guest issue didn't generate any comments - was it so good that
you didn't even notice ? ;-) )


    @{b}IRA GRAVES@{ub}

    Personnel, non-aligned, rare QC.

    Integrity 4
    Cunning 12
    Strength 2

    CIVILIAN, Cybernetics, Computer Skill, SCIENCE.
    Treachery and Biology if Kareen Brianon in play.
    Staff Star (+).

@{i}"A mentor of Dr. Soong and thus Lt. Commander Data's 'grandfather'. Arguably
one of the greatest minds of the age. Has Darnay's disease."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The essential cyberneticist. I love him because he's really great for one of
the most surprising deck designs you can play.

First there's his "living Red Alert" function. And while it's limited to
androids, you can build great crews out of mostly androids and you still get
to play an Event during the turn you want to report androids. (I just love
playing Kivas, drawing 2 or 3 androids and deploying during the same turn).
Talk card advantage.

Besides Cybernetics, you get a dual classification (always a Good
Thing(TM)), and in this case, SCIENCE and CIVILIAN comes in handy for at
least one deck type - Android Colony. As soon as you have enough androids to
overcome the Dilemmas on a planet mission (use Q's planet if you want to
have an easy time), you can report all future STAs as CIVILIANs and start
scoring. And the extra point per turn from Ira is not the worst thing to
have either.

Only big weakness: The Integrity of 4. Can't he have 5 to be
Firestorm-proof?

The remainder of the card is solid. A three-skill person, who will become a
five-skill guy if Kareen Brianon is anywhere on the table (and she's not too
crappy either - three skills and a special ability). One more INTEGRITY and
we might have one of the best personnel cards in the game. With this risk
remaining, just a good one.

Hi, folks,

even though I'm away I won't let you down completely, here's an Event which
I hope you found (stop doing author searches when looking for the COTD -
check for the title ;-) )


    @{b}ZALKONIAN STORAGE CAPSULE@{ub}

Event, rare QC.

Plays on table. Each turn, you may store one hand card here (may be returned
to hand at any time). If destroyed, shuffle stored cards and place group on
top or bottom of draw deck.

@{i}"Alien information storage device salvaged from John Doe's escape pod. Uses
a chemically based system for molecular energy encoding."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of these "protect your hand cards" gadgets that have lately become quite
popular in that other card game (by Wot$). The uses of these devices are
often not too readily apparent, but we'll see...

1) Against people using Masaka, TAK and Warp bubbles. Get one card out of
their reach each turn. This can be especially cool against TAK as you'll get
to save your good cards first and if you're smart you'll always store the
card you just had to show (unless you don't mind losing it) and this keep
your opponent guessing blindly.
Against the Warp bubble, the difference between losing six cards and only
losing three can very well be deciding. And for the Masaka thing - what
better storage place can you imagine for a Devidian Door?
(Actually, a smart opponent can overcome this with Masaka and a Kevin. On
your turn, Kevin the capsule. If its owner quickly takes back the Door,
Masaka him. If not, do nothing. He's screwed either way)

2) Against Subsection Q Paragraph 10. For those people who just love large
hand sizes and surprising 20-card plays.

3) Against opponents with a bad memory: Combine it with Alien Probe...

4) Similar theme: Defence against Life-Form scans. Is that thing down there
a Kevin or a Mot? ;-)

5) As a last resort against running out of cards. If you have a decent crew
on the table and risk running out of cards before getting 100, just throw a
few cards into the capsule and then Kevin it yourself. Gets you the
necessary turns. (Highly interesting if you want to go through your deck
quickly with a Traveler while playing your table cards more slowly. Recycle
the ones you didn't need and increase your options.

Granted, neither of these uses is particularly powerful, but which other
card has five sensible applications?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Zalkonian Storage Capsule + Alien Probe. So much for fairness ;-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #353@{ub}


Hi, folks,

I'm back (a little later than expected - sorry) and here's something for our
Klingon friends:


    @{b}ARBITER OF SUCCESSION@{ub}

Interrupt, rare QC.

Two strongest Klingon leaders at one location battle. Place on winner to
score [10] points and nullify Klingon Civil War. If killed, points transfer
to opponent. (Not duplicatable)

@{i}"Jean-Luc Picard was chosen to administer the Klingon Rite of Succession to
select a new High Council Leader. The ritual concluded when one challenger
was killed in battle."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, this card can be used in three situations:

1) You play Klingon. In this case, you practically need only 90 points to
win. You simply play the Arbiter when you have 90 points, sacrifice one of
your leaders (for which you don't have much use anymore when you just won)
and start picking up your cards. Straightforward and often a cool version to
bag a game, especially as the difference between 90 and 100 is often a
fourth mission if some point drainer cards are involved.

2) Your opponent plays Klingon. In this case, this is an "injury upon
insult" type card. Just play it on a pair of his leaders and rid him of a
personnel while scoring some points. However this is a risky proposition. If
he can find a way to sacrifice the remaining personnel, he can suddenly
score 10 points by just killing his own guy. (a redshirted Dilemma often
does the trick)

3) You both play Klingon. This is of course the best case. If you manage to
get a leader stronger than any of your opponent's leaders to a location, you
can bag the character and the 10 without running the risk that your opponent
might sacrifice the winner. Just make sure that you don't run into a nasty
Dilemma with your leader afterwards.

Big question now. Can you score this more than once? The Answer: Yes, but
you will have to be very lucky. One of the few ways to get rid of one
character without killing him is Penalty Box (It's an out of play placement,
so no killing is involved). But you'll need to get a Penalty Box from the
appropriate Q-Continuum and hit the right character. This way, you keep the
points and get rid of the character. You can even Ux the Penalty Box to
return the guy to your hand and try again.

But why stick with scoring the Arbiter twice? Use Toq and K'ChiQ! They are
both leaders if you play it right and K'ChiQ is discarded if you have no
males. And most important, K'ChiQ wins the fight so you get her discarded
with the Arbiter on her.

How about this draw deck: Traveler x2, K'ChiQ x10, Toq x10, Arbiter x10, Red
Alert! x2. This deck can win without ever attempting a mission, building a
Colony, beaming or leaving your outpost. Just report, battle, score, repeat.

Not very fast, but at least a nasty surprise for some opponents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

Hi, folks,

judging from the number of ORs, this card is a Star Wars card. Judging from
the image however it belongs to our favorite game...


    @{b}PLEXING@{ub}

Interrupt, common QC.

Nullifies Empathic Echo OR Parallax Arguers OR Frame of Mind OR System-Wide
Cascade Failure OR Thought Maker (May not be nullified).

@{i}"A Betazoid relaxation method taught to Reginald Barclay by Deanna Troi.
Stimulating a nerve cluster behind the ear releases natural endorphins and
helps to reduce anxiety."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, at least this review won't be bORing. NOR will it be the shORtest one
I've ever written as all these functions will probably require a few mORe
lines than fOR other cards.

Number One: Getting Rid of Parallax Arguers. This is bORing. Hey, your
opponent plays such a cool card and you can't even affORd an Amanda ?

Number Two: Empathic Echo. Now this is causing you sORrows ? Your Away team
OR crew most be pretty pathetic. Come on, this is nothing mORe than a
specialized Archer and about as powerful. If this hits you, you should thank
some entity that it wasn't Barclay's ProtomORphosis Disease instead...

Number Three: Frame of Mind. Our good old "One crewmember becomes useless.
Cure with - fORget it, you don't have that" (yes, I quoted myself) card.
Plexing gives you at least a fighting chance to save your character befORe
he goes completely nuts. However I doubt this would warrant the inclusion of
Plexing in a deck; as the Dilemma is random selection, it is as probable as
not that an impORtant personnel will be chosen. However, you'll have a
slight chance of spoiling a thORoughly thought out combo of your opponent...

Number Four: System-Wide Cascade Failure. Now really. A rare Dilemma when
you could instead use the mORe devastating Chinese Finger Puzzle OR the as
powerful Android Nightmares ? You must be really desperate befORe you use
this. So Plexing won't find any significant probability of encountering this
victim, we can safely ignORe this function.

Number Five: Thought Maker. Aaaaah, now that we almost explORed the entire
card we are getting the pattern. An Artifact nullifier with a scORe of
secondary functions to allow using the card even if your opponent chooses
not to use the Artifact. Only that in this case, none of the minOR functions
are really great as they all require your opponent to use specific cards and
the Thought Maker can be as well gotten rid of with a basic Amanda (except
fOR the fact that Plexing cannot be countered). But then, Thought Maker is
not the most frequently played Artifact in the wORld, so again, no great
scORe.

Net result: Five functions, two mORe than on any other STCCG card up to now,
but none really great. Not a card I'd put into any deck unless struck by a
fit of mORonism. I don't like cards that nullify specific not-too-often used
cards and I also don't like cards that won't wORk unless your opponent plays
specific cards. This one is both, so I'd say it's wORthless.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #355@{ub}


Hi, folks,

there are cards that punish Redshirting and cards that punish mega-teams.
And there's one card that punishes both.


    @{b}Q'S VICIOUS ANIMAL THINGS@{ub}

    Dilemma, planet, common QC.

Unless 22 < Strength < 55, one Away Team member is killed (random selection)
and opponent re-seeds Dilemma under a different unsolved planet mission.

@{i}"Wearing Napoleonic uniforms and firing musket-shaped energy weapons, Q's
creatures attacked Riker and his away team. Worf gave them their colorful
moniker."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So much for a really cool concept. The idea here is obvious. If your team is
too large, you take damage. If it's too small, you take damage. Only if you
can keep yourself right in the middle, everything is okay. If it weren't
that weak! There are lots of better Dilemmas to kill one person, without any
nasty prerequisites. Hunter Gangs is an alternative with a 1 kill average,
Armus does the exact thing without any prerequisite and then there's of
course always Yuta. Granted, Yuta and Armus are rare, but Hunter Gangs is
just as common and you get a higher killing average.

So as a one-shot Dilemma the Animal Things are way too weak and I could find
a truckload of better stuff. Maybe the reseed clause helps out a bit. Maybe.
So I first assume your opponent is a notorious redshirter or the kind that
starts no mission attempt with less than 10 crew. And then I assume you put
the Animal things under the right mission to hit at least once.

At this point you get to reseed it under a different mission, last, so it
will be encountered first. Oh great. If your opponent really has a
redshirting strategy, he'll send another redshirt and send your Animal
Things packing to yet another planet. And if he has a large crew strategy -
well what should stop him from using a Genetronic Replicator and laughing
about your Animal things? Maybe the fact that he gets stopped. Okay. That
might actually work, stopping your large-crew opponent more than once with
one Dilemma.

This of course requires your opponent playing a big-crew planet deck. And
you know how much I like cards that are only effective if your opponent
plays a very specific kind of deck or combo. You can't even put this one in
a tent because it's a seed card. Yep. Great. Really. Where's my Armus?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * If I have to: Q's Vicious Animal Things and Q (encountered in this
   order). Good chance to hit at least something.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #356@{ub}


Hi, folks,

the first shape we ever saw Q in was...


    @{b}ALDEBARAN SERPENT@{ub}

    Q-Event, common QC.

Unless the number of personnel in this crew or Away Team > lowest attribute
present, place on mission. After experiencing any remaining [Q] icon cards
in this Q-Flash, crew or Away Team is "stopped" and you must attempt a
different mission before attempting this one again.

@{i}"You will abandon this mission, Captain. My business with you takes
precedence."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is just one of the cards that can't go wrong in a Q-Continuum unless
you add just too many of them. It is quite effective if your opponent uses a
redshirting strategy to get past your Q-Flashes (quite common from what I
saw in games lately) and if not, well, it is about as good as drawing a
third copy of some other Q-card already encountered (likely event against
large teams).

The effect is similar to the one of Edo Probe, however it has two notable
differences. The first is that it is absolute once it triggers, the other is
the fact that it does not require completing another mission, just
attempting it. So when you get hit by it, just send an expendable in a
Runabout or Science Vessel to another mission, attempt and then continue the
business you came here for in the first place. And don't even fear your
expendable hitting another serpent, the fact that you are going to reattempt
your original mission also clears the way for your crew at the second
mission. So unlike the Edo, the Aldebaran Serpent can never deadlock a
player.

I always like to have two or three of these, just to punish those nasty
people who pass my "You will in Time" by sending in exactly two people.

Oh, and one little trivia (way too easy): In a recent game, one player
beamed a single personnel to a planet mission, encountered Aldebaran Serpent
and was unaffected. What was the mission?
(Note the personnel was in full health and unaffected by any attribute-
draining cards)
[ Allen, I'll be disappointed if I don't get your answer within 45 minutes
;-) ]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Aldebaran Serpent + You will in Time. Do you dare to redshirt?

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #357@{ub}


Hi, folks,

players have always asked for them, now Decipher makes them - cards that
make battle a more viable option:


    @{b}DATA'S MEDALS@{ub}

    Interrupt, common QC.

Plays on any leader in a battle you just won to score [5] bonus points.
Stays on that leader. Points lost if leader killed. (Not cumulative.)

@{i}"Lt. Commander Data's citations include Starfleet Command Declaration for
Valor and Gallantry, Medal of Honor with Clusters, Legion of Honor and Star
Cross."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually the most inappropriate card I have ever seen. Not only is Data
probably the last person to ever have earned one of his many decorations for
a battle victory, Decipher also dared to place the most inappropriate Easter
Egg ever on a card. Yes, I also longed for a card to honor Gene Roddenberry,
but it was definitely not a good idea to place his face on a card that
encourages battle! (I'm sure they could have found a Klingon name and image
for the card)

So much for rambling.

In game terms, we have a card that is very similar to Latinum Payoff and
Particle Fountain. "If you just [...] and have [...] present, get [...]
points." (The [...]s are variable ;-) ) First we will have to define the
conditions under which you can play the card. You need a battle you just
won. Well, this is easy for an away team battle, but how for a ship battle ?

What constitutes a won ship battle ? Damaging a ship without getting damaged
yourself ? (I'd say no) Destroying an opposing ship ? (I'd say no, again).
IMO, to win a space battle, you must destroy the last opposing ship present
and still have at least one ship left at the location. Maybe Bill will
correct me on this, though. Now for what you need as a side condition.
"Plays on a leader". Again a not-so clearly defined term, but I'd interpret
it the same way as "leader" is interpreted for the battle rules (i.e.
Leadership OR OFFICER OR Tal Shiar with neither of the other two present).
as there actually is a battle being referred to.

And the points are just again the basic flat 5 (no potential for confusion
here). How does this one compare to the other two ? Compared to Particle
Fountain, you have a much easier time having the correct personnel present
(after all, you could not have won the battle without a leader) and the
probability of the target event occuring (winning battle vs. solving planet
mission) is very much dependent on the deck type. So no clear-cut advantage
for either one. Against Latinum Payoff, you have the easier to meet
condition (any battle vs. a space battle), the easier to meet personnel
requirement, but the potentially much lower payoff. Latinum could easily be
worth 9, 12, 15 or even more points. But the average will be lower. Two
OFFICERs on a ship is realistic. Maybe three. And if you don't have other
cards that generate a score not evenly divisible by 5, a 6 or a 9 is no bit
better than a 5. So this one is better. And it allows you to do something
desperate that can easily score you a quick 5 or 10 without your opponent
being able to do much against it. Something that has to be my...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Data's Medals + Rogue Borg. Two Interrupts, 5 free points. Cool point
   source for an Arguer deck or other deck designed to totally demoralize
   your opponent and win 10-0.

Oops! Sorry for that! Looks like my PC just experienced a


    @{b}SYSTEM-WIDE CASCADE FAILURE@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet/Space, rare QC.

Mission continues, but one android present (your choice) dies at end of this
turn unless Dr. Soong OR Ira Graves present. Discard Dilemma.

@{i}"Lal was affected by a positronic matrix failure. Lt. Commander Data's
incomplete knowledge of Dr. Soong's work led to subtle design flaws in the
matrix."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh. Seems I overcame this cascade failure quite easily and not with too much
damage. And that's unfortunately what characterizes this card as well. You
just won't take too much damage from it. And it's (gasp) rare! Sad, saaad,
saaaaaaad.

Look at it. It kills one Android (if present). So far about as good as an
Armus or even a somewhat toned-down Yuta (you have some control over who
dies). Of course the "if present" part means the Dilemma will do nothing
against some decks. And I do not like cards that require your opponent to
play specific strategies, but I suppose by now you know that.

Next. The Android does not even die upon encountering the Dilemma. No, it
dies at the end of the turn! So what kind of cool Dilemma combo could I set
up here hoping to remove an Android and then do something nasty because of
that missing android. Okay, maybe Paxan "Wormhole" but that requires your
opponent to play a specific card and you know that I do not like cards that
re-... Oh, we had that before.

But it gets worse. The Dilemma says "your choice". That is not the person
seeding it but the person encountering it. Yikes! This means that if my
opponent plays many androids, he will all too probably find an expendable
one. Only if he plays very few androids do I have a really good chance of
hitting something vital. Which is of course a case of needing my opponent to
play certa-... Oh darn, I'm getting repetitive. Oh, did I tell you that the
Dilemma does not even stop ? "Mission continues, but..." Okay. It has one
use. It makes Wind Dancer look a little less bad.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #359@{ub}


Hi, folks,

these online games are taking their toll on my schedules, but at least every
now and then I manage to fit in another COTD like this:


    @{b}KLINGON CIVIL WAR@{ub}

    Event, rare QC.

Plays on table. While in play, when a Klingon ship destroys any opponent's
Klingon ship, winner scores points = loser's WEAPONS + SHIELDS. (Immune to
Kevin Uxbridge).

@{i}"Powerful political 'houses' in Klingon society can form factions that vie
for control. Gowron and his supporters defeated the forces of Duras in the
civil war of 2367-68."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, if this card belongs somewhere, it definitely is not your deck. If you
don't play Klingon, it belongs in your binder, that's for sure, and if you
do use a powerful Klingon attack deck, it still does not belong in there,
instead you'd be well advised to stock it in your Q's tent. Why? Geez, you
can ask questions. This card requires you to destroy opposing Klingon ships
to score any points. Now how probable is it that you'll get anything here if
your opponent does not play Klingon? Right. About 0%. So play Klingon and
put the card in your tent in the hopes of seeing your opponent play Klingons
too. An event whose odds are pretty slim at a serious level (Klingon being
the least played affiliation in the higher ranks of the online league and
being the least successful there too :-( )

But of course you can afford a slot in your Q's tent if you use one anyway.
So stick it in there and build a battle-oriented deck with lots of K'Vorts,
Bynars, Captain's Log and Plasmadyne Relays (so you can hunt down opposing
ships). Play Civil War (no fears of getting countered - it's immune unless
somebody has the idea of playing Arbiter of Succession, so stock an Amanda
or two as well). And while we're at scoring points off ship battles, why not
include a few Data's Medals, Death Yells and Latinum Payoffs (use those
Duras sisters!)? With the right Interrupts, you can easily get 40 points off
a single reasonably well-staffed ship (9 Latinum, 5 for Death Yell, 10 for
the Medals - on two different leaders - and 16 for the Bynar-enhanced ship).
Worth about a full mission. Wait a second... Did I say worth one mission?
Latinum, Death Yell, 2 Medals, Civil War, Captain's Log, Relay - that's 7
cards for the first ship I want to kill that way (and 4 for every further
one). Ouch, this seems to be a lot! So I suppose this strategy won't work
too well. So we are stuck with a few quick bonus points in case your Klingon
battle deck is pitted against a less trigger-happy Klingon deck (Remember -
the Civil War works for both players!)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Klingon Civil War + Latinum Payoff + Death Yell(s) + Data's Medals.
   Turns a K'Vort into a Borg Ship (points-wise).

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #360@{ub}


Hi, folks,

here's a Stellar way of scoring:


    @{b}RAGER@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, uncommon QC.

    Integrity 7
    Cunning 6
    Strength 6

    OFFICER, Navigation, Stellar Cartography, Youth,
    Scores 5 points if helps solve Explore Dyson Sphere.
    Staff Star (+)

@{i}"Ensign Rager is an experienced Conn officer. Served on the U.S.S Enterprise
from 2367 to 2369. Piloted the ship inside a Dyson Sphere found near
Narpin V."{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another addition for the highly effective defensive Federation Space decks
and the almost first reason to play Dyson Sphere.

Yes, really, why use Explore Dyson Sphere (rare, 35, span 2, requires
ENGINEER x3, Navigation, Computer Skill, Physics) if you can instead as well
use Repair Mission (common, 35, span 2, requires ENGINEER x3 and Computer
Skill)? Hmmm, I don't get it unless you have someone with Physics and
Navigation in a Cryo under Repair or you have Rager. This combo actually
gets you somewhere. Have an AU Physics guy and a BGB in your Repair mission
Cryo and play with a high number of ENGINEERs. Solve repair, use BGB to get
Rager if you didn't draw her before, do Dyson Sphere and then Study Stellar
Collision. (You need the 5 points from Rager as SSC is only worth 25). Score
= 100 unless you hit something nasty (The Higher...) in the process.

However, why stop there? Cartography can as well get you a few more points
with Explore Black Cluster and Study Nebula. 35+35+25, very close to 100 and
you should be able to find the last 5 with a Dilemma or a Cryo plus Ressikan
Flute.

Hmmm, a Stellar Cartography deck? Not the worst idea. Actually, I built one
(tried to get the ultimately fast Fed Space deck). The target number was 11
personnel (wanted that many Events and Interrupts) and I had the Dyson
Sphere and all three Cartography missions in it.

Well, my final personnel selection : Rachel Garrett, Jenna D'Sora, Dr.
Reyga, Richard Galen, Roga Danar, Katherine Pulaski, Scotty, Picard, Worf,
Bev Crusher, Vekor.

WAIT A SECOND! I just built a deck customized for Rager and what happens?
She's not in there !!! Oops... Yes, she's an okay card and she was in the
deck for quite some time. But when the final tweaking came around, I ditched
Study Plasma Streamer for Investigate Rogue Comet (Picard was only there for
his 2 Diplomacy) and swapped Rager for Galen. So the Rager deck was finally
played without Rager ;-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Rager + Explore Dyson Sphere + Study Stellar Collision.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #361@{ub}


Hi, folks,

I have good news for you ! Just for once, Decipher allowed me to preview a
card from the next expansion. Right, a Fajo Collection card.


    @{b}SOLOF'S LIRPA@{ub}

    Artifact, Fajo Collection.

Use as an equipment card. Up to 4 Vulcans present each gain 1 skill of your
choice. You may change those skills once per turn (Not duplicatable).

@{i}"Weapon from the Dark Ages before Romulans and Vulcans separated. Rumored to
give the user the power to mindmeld with spirits from the past."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Artifact. Well, what else did we have to expect. But finally we get a
card that makes these Vulcans a little more usable. Really, except for the
Vulcan Mindmeld, what did they have? None of them had that great skills.

Perhaps you might now say "What's the catch? You get just one skill instead
of all of them and it's limited to four people...", but it's actually a lot
better than Vulcan Mindmeld.

Reusability is the one factor. The Mindmeld Interrupt is used and gone while
you can employ this one over and over again. Like a permanent mindmeld card.

Intrinsically even more important is the other difference between the two
cards. You may not only select skills present but any skill, so if you need
something really desperately this is the card to go for.

Let's just compare to another card that might come to mind: K'ChiQ. She can
select a skill and change it at the start of each turn, here we can change
any time during the turn or as Jason put it:

'The Lirpa is the ultimate Emergency K'ChiQ.'

So where would I want to use it? In rather any deck that is well suited for
making sure that I can definitely overcome all Dilemmas at one mission. Q's
Planet might always be an alternative for this strategy, but it relies on
meeting an unprepared opponent to work.

Finding a regular mission suitable for seeding the Lirpa is not as easy, but
you might want to consider Reunion (Spock) or Evacuation (Sarek).

Or of course you can wait for the one Fajo card that Tom hinted me to as
allowing you to "introduce a totally new way of using Artifacts".

Or you might even fool your opponent to do the dirty work for you. Hide the
Lirpa under a low-point triple affiliation mission and play the Charybdis.
Then use Brain Drain to remove his Archaeology and snatch the Lirpa without
any risk. Then get four Vulcans and a few Androids and run through
everything he might throw your way. You'll however give your opponent some
points with this strategy.

Lastly, this card makes for an excellent bluff. Keep an away team of
defenceless, leader-lacking Vulcans on the planet. Just when your opponent
attacks, get a Leadership and beat him up. Add some other Vulcan devices
like a Stone of Gol for good measure.

Summary result: A card really worthy for today's review. REALLY !!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Well, this would be a great one: Solof's Lirpa and Mirror Universe
   (COTD #100) - get past all Dilemmas on the first mission using the
   Mirror then use your newfound skills to make your opponent look like a
   complete fool.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #362@{ub}


Hi, folks,

for today I'll present you a COTD without any GOTCHA or WHACK or HEE,HEE
effect (well, I do that most of the time, but...) After the hit rate of my
April 1 issue however , I'd better state explicitly that this is a real
card:


    @{b}GARAK@{ub}

    Personnel, Cardassian/Non-aligned, rare DS9 / First Anthology.

    Integrity 7
    Cunning 8
    Strength 6

    CIVILIAN, SECURITY, Computer Skill, Honor, Staff Star (+), AU Icon.
    May replace anyone randomly selected to die here.

@{i}"Cardassian Male. Virtual Player in the Vorta scenario testing the resolve
of the Alpha Quadrant species. Risked his life in the defense of his
comrades."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A real and cool preview of a new affiliation. The Cardassians, slated to
debut in the DS9 set, make their first appearance here. Now the first
question I've heard from everyone seeing this card is "Why, except for the
fact that he's a preview does he have that Cardassian affiliation?". Well,
it does some things. First he can solve Cardassian Missions while in
Cardassian mode. This is more important than it may seem, smaller
affiliations like the Cardies and Romulans need solid non-aligned support
and it is not at all unusual to find 65% of the crew in such decks being
non-aligned (And there's nothing more frustrating than having all skills
required and being unable to attempt a mission because one lacks an
affiliated character).

Second, and that's overlooked, this card neatly answers a request players
have made quite often. Our good Garak allows players to play a purely
non-aligned deck! Count him as Cardassian for your outposts (so you can seed
one) and then play him as a non-aligned to fulfill the "requirement" that no
affiliated crew may ever show up in your hand or in play. Oh, and don't
forget that the Cardassian affiliation might give Plain Simple Garak a bonus
from other cards...

For the rest... 7/8/6 is solid, on the same level as most bridge crew cards.
The dual classification is at least interesting, CIVILIAN combined with
whatever makes good cards for Colony decks and if that whatever is SECURITY,
you have one of the better combinations. The skills, Computer Skill and
Honor are not that great for a non-aligned but at least Honor should be
quite rare in Cardassians (as will be CIVILIAN), so he should be part of the
crew for some of the higher-scoring Cardie missions.

And his special ability? A built-in Security Sacrifice card(ie), thus giving
you two cards for the price of one. And in a game where the recent
developments in strategy have shown how important card advantage is, having
a virtual 61st card in your deck (and drawing it at no cost) can be an extra
boost for your victory chances.

BTW: Yuta is a random selection so Garak can also stand in as cannon fodder
for this popular Dilemma, saving you the wait for Marouk if she's yet again
at the bottom of your draw deck...

Hey Decipher, get those Anthologies out!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Garak + Taris + Dr. Reyga + Major Rakal: The latest rainbow Kurlan
   Naiskos team.
 * Garak + Kareen Brianon + Ira Graves + Kitrik + Soong-Type Androids.
   REALLY fast colony points.

Hi, folks,

363, magic number ;-) (Although I'd love to see even half that in new cards
at once - see how expectations can go down...)


    @{b}SECURITY PRECAUTIONS@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet, common QC.

To get past, Away Team must have Jenice Manheim OR android OR phaser OR
disruptor OR 3 SECURITY.

@{i}"Dr. Manheim's laboratory deep inside a remote planetoid used a system of
forcefields and targeting lasers to bar entry and protect a revolutionary
experiment."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I was tempted to write fORcefield and labORatORy, but I guess we had
that joke befORe ;-) (Plexing for those of you who don't remember...)

Of course that's not the most promising start for a Dilemma. Five
possibilities for overcoming is just more than a bunch, so this Dilemma
doesn't look as great at first sight. At second sight, however, well, let's
analyze. It's a wall Dilemma, meaning it's not that easily redshirtable. You
just need some crew to get past. Now what helps ?

Jenice Manheim. Ho-hum. Never seen her played until now. Just seems she's
not the favorite choice of moset players. And I understand that, at 0 skills
she's not entirely the best choice. And her special ability is at best a
mediocre Ressikan Flute counter (use Tijuana Crass against that).

3 SECURITY. How many ? Geez, most decks don't have that. Unless playing
Feds, lean decks are happy to have 2 of every major classification, maybe 3
MEDICAL, but that's it. The Feds could just do it, 3 each ENGINEER,
SECURITY, MEDICAL and SCIENCE. Or you play Madred...

Phaser or disruptor ? Yes, sure another thing I see played very rarely.
Although it might be interesting to stock one now just to keep your opponent
guessing wrongly for that Yuta. A few ability modifiers can work miracles
against that card. But yet a better bet (for Feds): Tasha Alternate. The
Phaser for precautions, the Leadership for nasties like Q and also a decent
SECURITY. Might have to be taken into account.

Most probable way of getting by however is having an android. Or more than
one. And Androids are good crew cards. So many players have them.

Thus: Bad Dilemma ? Nope. Combine with a Chinese Finger Puzzle and you can
be sure to stop those Androids cold. Add Hologram Ruse to ensure your
opponent goes in with more than one.

Well, what shall I say, this looks like one of the best Dilemma combos on
the market. Were it not for the fact that it's totally useless against space
missions. And competetive decks are just that often all space.

Result: A decent combo opportunity for lower to intermediate level play.
Part of a great anti-Q's-Planet-blocker combo in your tent. Not so good in
high-level play as too often unusable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Hologram Ruse + Security Precautions + Chinese Finger Puzzle (in Q's
   Tent, against Q's Planet nastiness).

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #364@{ub}


Hi, folks,

it's 12:15 am, I'm tired, but you are COTD-deprived, so I guess I should try
a quick one:


    @{b}OFF SWITCH@{ub}

    Interrupt, common QC

Place any android in stasis until end of turn. While in stasis, immune to
Android Nightmares, Chinese Finger Puzzle and Dead in Bed. OR Nullifies
another Off Switch.

@{i}"Lt. Commander Data has a deactivation switch hidden in his back.
Reluctantly, he informed Dr. Crusher of its existence to aid in the
re-assembly of Lore."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A dual-purpose card with an offensive and a defensive use. The defensive
purpose is pretty weak but in the right moment it can save your day. The
most obvious combo to nullify with the Off Switch is Interphasic Plasma
Creatures and Android Nightmares. The IPC triples the effect of the
nightmare and you have a good indication of what's coming. So you even have
enough time to switch off your Android so that you can pass the Dilemma.
That is, if you have no more than one android present...

Or the Chinese Finger puzzle. A nasty stopper that can disable you for more
than just one turn. The problem with that one is that you won't see it
coming that easily unless you run into Security precautions. So usually when
you hit it it's too late to do something about it. Besides, when you hit CFP
with just one Android, it's not that bad and when you hit it with several,
that one Off Switch won't help you that much either.

Okay, let's try offence. This requires your opponent to play certain cards
to be effective (and you all know what I think of this kind of card). But if
he does, you have a good chance of doing something really destructive. Take
out the lone android aboard a ship conveniently placed at Paxan Wormhole,
not only foiling a mission attempt but also getting that ship to a really
unwanted location (from its owner's view) in the process.

Other uses are getting rid of a much-needed classification or some serious
attribute points just before a killer Dilemma or just delaying a mission
completion by that one vital turn. And lastly, nullify another Off Switch.
Wait a second, your opponent is playing with what? And you, too??? Oh, come
on, that's really rare.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Off Switch + Paxan "Wormhole" + Opponent's ship with exactly one
   Android.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #365@{ub}


Hi, folks,

I finally got my 2-Player games (:-) :-) :-) :-)... and yes, that took its
time) and what could I do better than reviewing one of those beauties.

Also, this is maybe a card for a Major colleague of mine whose real self
hasn't exactly drawn the best ratings of all time :-)


    @{b}COMMANDER TROI@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, Premium, blue 2PG.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 7
    Strength 4

    V.I.P., Empathy, Diplomacy, Honor, Anthropology, Command Star (*),
    AU icon, Barash Icon.

@{i}"In Barash's illusion, Deanna Troi left the U.S.S. Enterprise to take a
position at Starfleet Command as Admiral Picard's diplomatic counselor."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apart from the fact that the rank of commander does not exactly match the
beautifully visible four bars on Deanna's Future Imperfect communicator, a
definite improvement on the real Troi.

One usually does have enough OFFICERs, but there are quite a few things you
could use a V.I.P. for. Probably the most obvious of these is Diplomatic
Conference. As a 60-point mission, this is just powerful. And two alternate
Trois (Commander and Major Rakal) can be the basis of a deck built around
Diplomacy, Empathy and VIP. Add Maques or Ral and you have three out of your
four covered. The last one can always be taken care of with a well-placed
Devidian Door or IKC T'Ong, so that affiliation problem is solved.

Now you say, what do I need that Cmdr. Troi for when Lwaxana or Tam Elbrun
can also do the trick?

The answer lies in the support skills. Diplomacy and Honor are really useful
if you want to turn your Conference deck into a real two-mission deck. Try
adding Wormhole Negotiations (all that Diplomacy) and some other honorable
characters with useful classifications (Worf or Tasha-Alt., Rachel Garrett,
Scotty) or special abilities (Dathon). Oh, now that we have some leaders, we
could use them for Cultural Observation (add Bev Picard as well) and
suddenly that Anthropology becomes real handy. And this Honor stuff combines
well with Avert Disaster (Hey, Vekor has Geology and you won't tell me you
don't have her in your deck). Enough 40-point and better stuff that you will
find at least one close to your Outpost conveniently seeded @ Conference.
Just add a point Dilemma or two (Sarjenka, conveniently seeded between your
opponent's last encountered two seeds, also spoiling Sheliak/Q in the
process)

Yeah, looks like the new Troi makes for a really good start in a conference
deck (or maybe one of the other unusual mission decks). Far more viable than
the original (who needs those 2 extra INTEGRITY) and also a good Major Rakal
backup you can use in parallel with the original.

Oh, this leaves one question open. That Barash Icon. For the moment, it's
safe to ignore it, but what happens later? Most probably this icon won't
change the play value of the card too much. It will add an extra weakness or
two, also an extra strength, much like the AU thingy, I presume. So let's
just wait for what it does...

Hi, folks,

here's something I'd sometimes like to do with some people (like Carta Mundi
guys who don't give STCCG the top priority ;-) )


    @{b}BRAINWASH@{ub}


    Event, rare QC.

Plays on one personnel you've captured. Captive returns to outpost, is under
your control and may mix with your personnel regardless of affiliation.

@{i}"Geordi La Forge was mentally reprogrammed to do the Romulans' bidding by a
machine that accessed his mind through his VISOR's direct neural implants."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

STCCG's Control Magic card. As easy to disenchant (read: Ux) as the Magic
counterpart and about the same effect: You get one character from your
opponent to use as yours.

However this one comes with a stiff "Casting cost". First you need to make a
captive. Best bet here: Cardie Trap. Those Empaths are not that common and
you will get a unique personnel, thus something at least marginally useful
(unless your opponent redshirted with Mot ;-) ) But let's assume you manage
to get a personnel. Then you can play Brainwash and use the card as if it
had been your own character. Hmmm, I just used a Dilemma to rid my opponent
of a personnel card and then took a card from my hand to get a personnel
into play. And to execute this combo, I need to wait for the Dilemma to take
effect. Why not just include a personnel card instead ? It can be affected
by Red Alert!, cannot be Uxbridged and will always suit your deck design,
something which you cannot say about your opponent's Jenna D'Sora in your
Klingon all-planet deck...

Well, there isn't much reason for it, but in the Mot spirit(TM), I'll try to
find a use for the card. Now what single advantage does your opponent's
personnel have against yours ? Right, it has the correct affiliation to do
your opponent's missions. So play heavy non-aligned and try to make a few
captives. Once you have one or two, drop Brainwash and start using them as
portable Espionages. Just don't use the High Sheriff of Nottingham unless
you have a really high ratio of SECURITY in your deck...

Works reasonably well in a Romulan Rakal/DeSeve espionage deck. Oh, BTW an
acceptable choice for a tent card. If you get a useful personnel with a
Cardie Trap, just dig it out. Otherwise leave it where it is...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Just for the pictures: Seize Wesley and Brainwash. The blind eyes, the
   scream, the device... All there ;-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #367@{ub}


Hi, folks,

okay, I hate cards I can't get in Black Border Editions but this one is just
to cool to pass by:


    @{b}SPOCK@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, Premium(2), 2PG.

    Integrity 9
    Cunning 10
    Strength 7

    V.I.P., Diplomacy x2, Computer Skill, Leadership, SCIENCE, Mindmeld,
    Command Star (*).

@{i}"1/2 Vulcan, 1/2 Human son of Sarek and Amanda Grayson. Over 140-year old
ambassador. On private mission to Romulus. Mindmelded with Picard."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another really good 2PG card. Yep, you get it, I'm gonna say "dual
classification". ;-) And this one is truly unusual with the V.I.P. being one
of the two, but this finally gives us the chance to complete the "4-person
Naiskos team challenge". The idea was to select seven teams of 4 people each
so that they can use the Naiskos with the 4th circulating through the seven
possibilities for "any [insert classification]". (treaties allowed)

Now we have:

   * 1) Spock + Bev Picard + Kareen Brianon + SECURITY
   * 2) Spock + Roga Danar + Bev Picard + CIVILIAN
   * 3) Gov. Worf + Vekor + Kareen Brianon + OFFICER
   * 4) Bok + Dr. Graves + Gov. Worf + MEDICAL
   * 5) Kahlest + Gov. Worf + Bok + SCIENCE
   * 6) Kahlest + Dr. Reyga + Madred + V.I.P.
   * 7) Spock + Kahlest + Zon + ENGINEER

Yeah ;-)

Then, how about an 10-skilled personnel ? Send Spock off on a mindmeld
mission with Mogh and have him acquire SECURITY, Leadership, Honor x2, Music
and Archaeology, plus another Computer Skill. Or, even better, why stick
with 10 ? Mindmeld him with Cmdr. Troi (get Empathy, Anthropology, Honor and
another Diplomacy) and then look for the Eyes in the Dark, and with a little
luck, you have this whopping character:

SUPER-SPOCK, Personnel, Fed.
Integrity 14, Cunning 18, Strength 13
VIP, Computer Skill x2, SCIENCE, Diplomacy x3, Empathy, Honor, Music,
Treachery, Anthropology, Mindmeld, Archaeology, Navigation, Leadership,
Command Star. Wow ;-)

Trivia: Which character do you have to get with the Eyes to achieve this ?
;-)

Oh, regular non-cool game uses ? Sure, but I mentioned these skills so often
that I thought I'd rather name the strange ideas that came to my head ;-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Of course: Spock + Scotty + McCoy + Reunion. A classic ;-)

Hi, folks,

How about another "Sneak Peek" card ?

Yes ?

Then scroll down...

Okay, here's a card that will allow you some sneak peeks :


    @{b}TARMIN@{ub}


    Personnel, non-aligned, rare QC.

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 6
    Strength 3

    V.I.P., Once per game, may glance at the cards in any one side deck
    for 10 seconds, Empathy.

@{i}"An Ullian 'telepathic historian' who uses empathic skills to recall
detailed historical information from his volunteers' memories."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(GOTCHA! ;-) )

Yep, another Jaglom-type information broker. But this time, we are talking
about side decks. And we are talking a card that, even if it had the same
effect as Jaglom, has a few unique advantages and disadvantages, namely:

   * You must play it as your normal card play. This means you must play it
     at the beginning of your turn and you lose that turn's card unless you
     have a Red Alert.
   * You get a 6/6/3 Empathic VIP in addition to your Jaglom effect. While
     this is not great, the other VIP Empaths aren't that much better.
   * You cannot use more than one during a game, even if you get your Tarmin
     killed and play a new one (this is a Q ruling).
   * He can't be nullified.

Okay, so far so good. Now the main effect. Glance at a side deck's contents
for 10 seconds. This is pretty short and you won't usually be able to either
make a very quick check for some card's presence or remember the top three
or so cards. Now there are four possible side decks you might want to look
at:

   * Opponent's Q's Tent. A very useful look if you hold a Revolving Door
     and want to find out whether there's something in that tent that would
     make the Door worthwhile. Or, just check if the one nasty card that
     could stop the combo you are planning is there.
   * Opponent's Q-Flash. Probably the most common application. You suspect
     he's using a Flash under a mission you want to attempt but are unsure
     whether to try redshirting or to rush in with a big crew. A scan of the
     nasties awaiting your crew might just bring the information you need to
     decide correctly.
   * Your own Q's Tent. Really useless. Q's tent does instruct you to select
     the card randomly if you don't use the "your choice" ability , so even
     if you know what card is on top, your opponent can demand you reshuffle
     the tent cards before drawing...
   * Your own Q-Flash. A very limited but potentially game-saving use. When
     you are using Gift of the Tormentor, you might just want to know when
     the first one turns up so you know whether to save that Countermanda or
     whether you can use it on your opponent's Palor play.

A special effect well in flavor for the card, but too limited to be really
useful. Now if it were "any deck"...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Not really. I wouldn't know what to combine it with.

Hi, folks,

in a fit of masochism, I'm going to write a new COTD today...


    @{b}KLINGON PAINSTIK@{ub}


    Interrupt, uncommon QC.

Return your Arbiter of Succession to your hand at any time, nullifying its
points. OR One unique personnel just killed may not be reported for duty
again by any player.

@{i}"Device employed to verify death in the Sonchi ritual. Also used in the
nentay (Rite of Ascension) to test courage. Can make a two-ton Rectyne
monopod jump 5 meters."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Um, two purposes, right? And both absoluuuuuutely great. Er, almost ;-)

Number one: Prevent your opponent from gaining ten points off your Arbiter
of Succession when he's just about to kill your new High Council Leader.
Well, only problem, you need to do that before the game action triggering
the death occurs. So you can't wait until the Dilemma that might kill your
leader resolves (or even until you can see what it is), but you will have to
use the Painstik in advance. The only situation in which this might be
sensible is if you are really desperate and need your council leader to help
in a mission attempt and you have a spare weakling on whom to play the
Arbiter again later. But what style are you playing that you used the
Arbiter that early? Why didn't you wait in the first place? Nah, not a
reason to include this in a deck.

Second, a unique personnel just killed may not be reported again. This might
just prove marginally useful. Not so much if your opponent loses a vital
crew card (use a Countermanda to thwart his Res-Q plans, which excludes up
to three crew from resurrection and makes him waste the turn for Res-Q), but
if you lose a non-aligned power guy (Roga Danar or Dathon) and your opponent
hasn't reported the same personnel yet. Dathon might just be the prime
target, many players have him in their Q's tent to get rid of those pesky
Shakas. And I might even recommend that use were it not for the "just"
killed bit. You lose your Dathon and now use the Painstik to prevent your
opponent from playing his. I think he's now going to use that Q's Tent for
something more constructive ;-)

The only situation in which the Painstik can become really interesting is if
you know exactly what deck your Cons- errr opponent is playing. Report his
key personnel early (including it in your deck as an off-affiliation and
usin a neutral outpost) and redshirt it. Then laugh.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Klingon Painstik + Sela (redshirted), but only against a certain Person
   ;-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #370@{ub}


Hi, folks,

remember a very, very old COTD? One where half a skill was concerned? Now,
finally, only exactly 250 issues later, here's the other half:


    @{b}JA'ROD@{ub}


    Personnel, Klingon, Promotional 2PG.

    Integrity 2
    Cunning 5
    Strength 8

    V.I.P., Treachery x2, Leadership x1/2, ENGINEER, Computer Skill,
    Attributes all +5 if with Toral. Command Star (*), AU icon.

@{i}"Father of Duras, Lursa and B'Etor. Disappeared shortly after transmitting
security codes to the Romulans, precipitating the Khitomer massacre."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looks quite solid. Three usable skills, a double classification and just for
fun another one of these attribute enhancers. Plus the fact that Toral's
half Leadership finally gets something resembling a use. Okay, details. The
dual of V.I.P. and ENGINEER is at least unusual and with the Klingons not
exactly being known for decent ENGINEERs, Ja'Rod can be of significant use
in any Naiskos-based deck.

Then we get a double Treachery. Well, those Klingons have enough of that
particular skill, but a double on one card can prove very useful when it
comes to solving missions like Wormhole or Secret Salvage, and using the
Treachery x4 in a Duras-Clan-deck as the basis of your mission attempts
means you don't need much more. Try this: Place your outpost at Wormhole.
Seed a Borg Ship and a Barclay's Disease there. Add any of the 5-point space
Dilemmas to taste. Then go for Ja'Rod, Kahlest, Zon and Galen. Just four
people. Throw them aboard the Fek'lhr and attempt. Your outpost-enhanced
shields withstand the Borg blast. Breeze by Barclay's Disease for 10 and do
the Wormhole for 45 (Ja'Rod, Zon, Galen = Treachery x4). Then just snatch
the Naiskos from the oh-so conveniently seeded Cryo and go Borg-hunting.
10+45+45 = 100 and the occasional 5 along the way gives you some Bailiff
protection. Best thing about this combo: It's only 6 draw deck cards (you
will need one more staff star to fly that Fek'lhr), all others are seeded.

Leaves you with 25+ other cards to solve Dilemmas and thwart any scheme your
opponent might want to throw your way.

Oh, I almost forgot that occasionally-vital Computer Skill. And that half
Leadership... But the latter you can forget about. Even if I attribute all
the combo bonuses to Toral and make him a 11/10/11 Leadership Youth guy, he
just wouldn't make the cut for a really good deck. But he's not really
necessary anyway, after all, Ja'Rod is quite okay alone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Ja'Rod + Zon + Galen + Kahlest + Fek'lhr + any Staff Star.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #371@{ub}


Hi, folks,

in honor of my recent ISOWC game, here's another card that was in that deck
inspired by the Ja'Rod COTD ;-)


    @{b}MOGH@{ub}

    Personnel, Klingon, 2PG

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 6
    Strength 9

V.I.P., SECURITY, Leadership, Honor x2, Computer Skill, Archaeology, Music.
Command Star (*), AU icon.

@{i}"Father of Worf and Kurn. Followed the traitor Ja'rod to Khitomer,
suspecting him of conspiring with Romulans. Rumored to have survived the
massacre."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Um, six skills, including Archaeology, Honor, Music and Leadership? Didn't
we see this before, but in a really different color? Right, of course. Our
good old bald Captain Picard himself.

And we will also have to take into account another card when comparing Mogh,
the other big red AU guy - Governor Worf who shares the double Honor and the
two classifications with Mogh. All three cards also have an attribute total
of 23, so they compare even better as we can leave this factor out of the
equation (only a very minor disadvantage for Governor Worf who suffers from
his odd Cunning when facing Hunter Gangs)

Okay, now that we're here, let's notice that Gov. Worf and Mogh don't really
compete, in fact they work together very well, especially when Wormhole
Negotiations is concerned. Each of them has two Honor, thus they can join
forces and form the first red two-person team to solve that mission (The
Feds could do it from the beginning with Sarek and Picard). Where they start
differing is when you are trying to build a deck that tries to win by
solving only two missions. Wormhole is an obvious choice for one of them
(add some point Dilemmas), and your deck should primarily focus on Honor.
Have one of the two in a Cryo at Wormhole depending on what your secondary
mission is. If you go for Pegasus search, don't even bother with the
Interphase Generator, stuff Gov. Worf and Zon into the Cryo and leave that
Artifact slot for a BGB or Horga'hn. If you prefer Hunt for DNA, stock the
Cryo with Mogh, Rasmussen and a BGB to make sure you can get Koroth. Either
way, a solid two-mission deck. Or do what I did, stock Mogh, Zon and a
Naiskos and use a Borg ship (plus a Barclay's Disease) to make a one-mission
deck.

So much on the red guys. And Picard? He's really being outclassed here. His
Diplo is present on so many other cards (even as a x2) and Navigation isn't
that rare either. But Computer Skill is a solid support skill that
surprisingly often lacks in streamlined personnel selections and the
SECURITY means that Mogh has a meaningful classification. I would not be too
amazed if Mogh soon becomes the most sought-after 2PG card.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Mogh + Cryosatellite in various variants for instant mission support
 * Mogh + Kahlest + Dr. Reyga + Nu'Daq: Any skills not present? ;-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #372@{ub}


Hi, folks,

this is a card some people would probably like to play on an ISOWC opponent
who fails to arrange his game (or on a COTD author who didn't deliver any
new review for 5 days ;-) )


    @{b}DISCOMMENDATION@{ub}


    Event, uncommon QC.

Plays on any Klingon who survived a losing battle. That Klingon is now
non-aligned, has no Honor and loses [-5] points.

@{i}"naDHa'ghach. Klingon ritual of shame. A disgraced warrior (and his
descendants for seven generations) are shunned and declared non-existent to
the rest of Klingon society."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(I know at least ten of you are just now checking my spelling of the Klingon
word ;-) )

Wait a second. Isn't this a card that requires your opponent to play a
certain card or strategy? Hmmm, I guess I already told you my opinion about
those. Right, it approaches zero.

And this one does not just require one but two conditions. Your opponent
must play Klingon and you must be able to win a battle against this opponent
(and Klingon players are not known for losing too many battles).

And what do you get for it? A really great effect. You turn a Klingon into a
non-aligned crewmember (as if a red player would play with that high a
non-aligned ratio that this would matter), you get to nullify some Honor
(yes, this might slow some opponents but you won't catch these speed players
being drawn into a battle unprepared) and you get to deduct 5 points from
your opponent's score.

Yup. And this all for the price of an Event (!) Not only do you need to meet
two conditions, but you also need to sacrifice a turn's card play to get the
rather mediocre effect.

No, I'll turn this one over to Mot for further dissection. I won't even try
to find an obscure use (otherwise Mot won't even find half a use not already
covered).

In the meantime, use Incoming Message: Klingon to slow down Red players and
The higher... the fewer or Edo probe to reduce opponents' scores.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, folks,

I'm gonna break with some tradition today (the fact that it's always the
numbers evenly divisible by 25 that get the special articles), but I think
that after this little hiatus you have maybe deserved more than just one
card...

...or two...

...or four...

...how about 12?

So let's jump right into...


    @{b}CARGO RENDEZVOUS@
    GRAVESWORLD
    SURVEY INSTABILITY
    HOMEWARD
    REPORTED ACTIVITY
    DISTRESS MISSION
    AVERT DANGER
    HOSTAGE SITUATION
    GAULT
    REOPEN DIG
    A GOOD PLACE TO DIE
    SENSITIVE SEARCH@{ub}

Missions, Planet, 25, 30 or 35 pts, 2PG common.
(I won't bother listing all game stats and lore - check the Decipher site
for the spoilers)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow, 12 cards that would never get a COTD review of their own. But maybe
they are just worth a review when seen together. They do have a lot in
common, namely they are fairly low point planet only missions that have low
requirements when it comes to odd skills. Many of them require a very common
skill plus an attribute total or even just classifications and some
attributes.

Now these cards were created for one thing: To be able to play quite well
with only common cards. But then who says you can't play them in a regular
deck with a few rares?

So let's take two rares. Just for a convenient example I'll pick Kitrik and
Dr. Graves. Oh, they both have Cybernetics. Let's throw in an Android or
seven. And Kitrik is by chance a male Klingon? Cool, let's also use K'ChiQ.
Oops, lotsa commons. Now for a few missions. Cargo Rendezvous? Sure - K'ChiQ
is a great Physicist and the rest is something for my androids. Reported
Activity? K'ChiQ will do the navigation stuff and don't tell me you don't
have two ENGINEER droids. Distress mission? Oh, K'ChiQ can stay home for a
change. Avert Danger? No problem. Hostage Situation? Wait, can't those
Androids choose their classifications when reporting? Reopen Dig or a Good
Place to Die? I'm sure K'ChiQ will have the right ideas. Sensitive Search?
Hmmm, I haven't seen an android that isn't competent with computers.

Wait, was that seven usable missions?

And what more, they are all planets (convenient hiding places for Artifacts)
and with 3 35s in the mix, you can even try to win with 3 missions even
though you have low-scoring stuff there.

Now where's the catch? Those Androids have rather high attributes, they
always have the classification you just need, they are immune to a few of
the nastier Dilemmas and they even get to choose their sex just in case
someone has a Matriarchal Society waiting.

Dangers? A few. Shaka - use Dathon or a few Klingon Diplomats as support.
Sheliak / Q - better hold a Q2. And Chinese Finger Puzzle - well, if you hit
this one without redshirting, you're royally scr*wed. So better have a Full
Planet Scan. Armus and other certain killers can also hurt. Oh, almost
forgot one: Q-Flash. You need more than just one or two guys for these
missions, so a Flash might actually get to do some harm. BTW, this deck
skeleton was just an example. Many others work just as well. You can
concentrate on building your crew for Dilemma busting and the missions
themselves are very easy to pass with a few people.

They might be missions for beginners, but the experienced player might just
use them for his own fiendish purposes ;-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Anything involving them and a bunch of commons.

Hi, folks,

welcome to another installment in this more and more inaccurately named
strategy series on STCCG ;-)


    @{b}MADRED@{ub}

    Personnel, rare QC

    Integrity 1
    Cunning 8
    Strength 6

    OFFICER, SECURITY x2, Once per turn, may add 1 to Interrogation or
    Torture if at your outpost. Command Star (*)

@{i}"Gul Madred, Cardassian Officer in the Obsidian Order. Specializes in
prisoner interrogation. Tortured Jean-Luc Picard time after time in 2369."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A personnel with two distinct uses. One is the good old dual classification
you can carry around to overcome Dilemmas or feed classification-hungry
Artifacts. But somehow for this purpose alone, Madred would not be the ideal
candidate as Zon can just do the same job. However you might be playing
without AU cards, so Madred is at least an alternative for this case. But
there are a few more situations in which Madred might be handy:

   * Security Precautions. You don't play with weapons (who does) and you
     don't want to run in there with androids rightfully fearing the obvious
     continuation of that episode in the form of a finger puzzle. Well,
     Madred can provide 2 of the 3 Security.
   * Space decks. You don't need Zon's Guaramba and anti-Nausicaan ability
     here. So you can as well take the second SECURITY.
   * Cardassian trap. Well, don't forget that card. Madred is the ideal
     Security Officer for any team afraid of Cardie traps.

The second use involves playing Madred not as a personnel but as an Event.
You just put him at your outpost and let him sit there. Then you get a
captive from somewhere and play Interrogation. Oh, and while you're at it,
you also do something to prevent your opponent from just giving you the 10.
Like scoring 90 points before you do this entire thing. Great use? Yes.
Exactly. The usual benefit you'll gain from this is to provide an incentive
for your opponent to give you the 10 from the Interrogation. As if his
crewmember were not incentive enough.

Let's forget the second use here. Madred is a solid double SECURITY for a
space deck and can in a tight situation even lead a battle. He might just be
a good tent card for decks relying on Q's planet (to get around that
Security Precautions). Otherwise, not too remarkable. Just your average
cruel, brute and uncivilized Cardassian ;-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Hmmm, do I have to? Okay, Madred and Torture. I don't know what Torture
   does, but it can't be worse than Interrogation for combo possibilities
   here ;-)

Hi, folks,

375 is a special number and about as special is the Internet Expansion IV.
More submissions than ever, better ideas than ever and more reviews than

I promised you mini-reviews of the runner-ups from #11 to 20. This is not
going to happen. Instead I passed those to Dr. Telek R'Mor for full and
extensive reviewing so everyone who got their card up to the rating ballot
will receive a full review !

On to business:

10th place - (oops, my own, what a shame)


    @{b}SURVIVAL TRAINING PLANET@{ub}

    Mission, Fed / Kli / Car, Planet, Span 3. Score X

    SECURITY + STRENGTH > 19.
    X = 60 divided by number of people in away team.

@{i}"Somewhere in Delta Quadrant: Find a way off a Kazon Training Planet"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep, a weird mission. As if I could ever do an Internet Expansion without
trying to sneak one of those in there ;-)

The fun here is to solve the mission with as small a crew as possible.
Obviously the two person case is not that hard (Roga Danar plus any Strength
9 personnel) and in this case the Survival Training Planet is just as good
or bad as a Brute Force except that it's easier to solve. However you will
of course want to go for the big one. The 60. And for that you'll have to go
in with one lone personnel. And this gets us to use a few cards Mot could
use in his reviews because they are usually tagged as "useless". How about
for example Devidian Foragers? Add the attributes of some discarded
personnel to an AU icon crewmember until end of turn? Yeah great. Unless you
send Tasha-Alternate (10 with her phaser already) on a survival mission and
bag the big 60.

Or, what was that most useless Artifact? Varon-T Disruptor? Yeah, again a 60
for you if in the hands of Tasha, Worf or a disruptor-equipped Governor
Worf.

While we're at it and just for fun: 12 Targs at your outpost and then send
Governor Worf ;-)

Still not enough? Ask some youthful universal SECURITY officer to do your
bidding and boost him with Lower Decks and Humuhumunu... the Fish Well,
you're still a few points short, but there are always those weapons. Of
course there's one big problem when solving this mission: As soon as you
pass the last Dilemma you'll need to be unable to solve so you can reduce
your away team size. Or, you need to make sure that when you pass the last
Dilemma, you're already down to one or two crew. And any smart oppponent
will put something like Shaka-Barclay or even Security Precautions there to
make sure you won't just rush in with one lone personnel or with a large but
Security-less team. Best defense against stuff like that: Sarjenka. Seed her
as fast as possible so you can stop yourself after passing all nasties and
get +5 points along the way. Then send your lone brute. And once you're
here, all set up and ready to do it, a smart opponent will dash all your
ideas with a well-placed Frame of Mind.

Not an easy card to play correctly, although you can always use it as a
quick low-point artifact hiding place if you need to.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Survival Training Planet + Sarjenka

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #376@{ub}


Hi, folks,

just so that the scene won't entirely be dominated by Dream Cards, I will
interleave those IE4 cards with normal cards at least some of need no longer
dream of because they already have them... (Which is a reminder to my card
source who I'm sure is reading this to send mine a little quicker ;-) )


    @{b}DR. TELEK R'MOR@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan, rare FA/VOY

    Integrity 7
    Cunning 7
    Strength 7

    SCIENCE, Astrophysics x2, Stellar Cartography, Honor, ENGINEER,
    May report directly to any ship, Command Star (*), AU icon.

@{i}"Romulan Astrophysical Academy member on deep space duty in 2351. Beamed to
the present via a micro-wormhole to the U.S.S. Voyager."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Romulan Space deck was always good. Now it's better. Now there always
were two-person teams that could complete a mission. There even were those
that could complete two or three. But how about a two-person crew that can
complete SIX missions, and, to add just a little to the deck efficiency, all
six are Space Missions and they are all doable by the same affiliation
(Romulan in this case, natch).

Well, I'll give it away: Put Nick Locarno and Dr. R'Mor into a Combat Vessel
(about the largest thing they can fly without help from anyone else) and use
these six:

   * Study Plasma Streamer
   * Study Stellar Collision
   * Secret Salvage
   * Explore Typhone Expanse
   * Study Lonka Pulsar
   * Investigate "Shattered Space"

A 205 point total, BTW, assuring that more than half of all possible
three-mission combinations (to be exact, 14 out of 20) yield the desired 100
points. So just send a ship loaded with lots of classification-heavy crew to
overcome all those nasty Dilemmas and keep your big two in reserve for the
kill. Beaming obstacles won't disturb you in any way, you will never need to
transfer crew between ships and as you can always keep the valuable pair one
location away from danger, you won't accidentally lose them to a misplaced
Borg ship or similar nasty surprise.

Oh, I did just overlook something. R'Mor is more than a green card with
Astrophysics x2 and Stellar Cartography. You get a SCIENCE and an ENGINEER
classification, you get Honor, oh and you even get that nifty special
ability with which you could even do the entire run even if you don't have a
second ship - just clear out the nasties and then report

R'Mor to the ship instead of first returning to your outpost. Oh, there's
also a nice AU icon in case you want to use that Decius. Hmmm, if a card is
great when I just look at half of its potential, what so I have to say about
the completed card?

Hi, folks,

fate puts the two original STCCG online players right next to each other in
IE4 ratings:

9th Place - Author: Tebok


    @{b}BARASH'S NEURAL SCANNERS@{ub}

    Interrupt, common

Play when opponent encounters Hologram Ruse. Retreive up to three personnel
from your discard pile (random selection) to your hand. They now have a
[Barash] icon and any [holo] icon is disregarded. You may change one skill
on every card. You must show the cards to your opponent.

@{i}"Using special neural scanners, Barash was able to read people's mind and
recreate the people they knew... with some modifications."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a neato, even if it depends on another card and is thus once again
dependent on your opponent playing a certain strategy (planet missions you
could place the Hologram Ruse under). But then this is not too rare an
occurrence and even if your opponent does not use any planets you are not
completely lost if you do something that fits the Barash theme quite well:
Bluff.

Retrieve a Q's Planet from your tent and seed it with one card, not too far
away from one of your ships, but not too far from one of your opponent's
either. He will assume your seed is an Artifact and try to steal it. Of
course he'll run into your Holo Ruse and you get the personnel you want to
get.

And this really means personnel you want to get. Even if you have no
sensible cards in your discard (let's say Amarie, Mot and Alex Rozhenko),
you get three skills you just needed. Plus potentially more if the personnel
that went to the discard were originally worth something. Oh, you play one
of those decks where you don't lose any personnel? Hey, what a place to use
Trust Me (and then a few Temporal rifts to drive out those Amandas).
Suddenly you can choose the crew to report from your entire collection.
Great for an Espionage deck (you remember that concept, dear Mot? ;-) )

A card I like - hard to use but potentially very powerful. And it gives a
constructive purpose to cards that would otherwise have to be reviewed by my
dear Biloan colleague and no I won't mention that word. Utter Silence
Emanates (from) Lips Eternally Safely Sealed... ;-)

Hi, folks,

those already writing me off as a series author better not do that this
early - I'm still planning to have 4-digit issue numbers some day ;-)


    @{b}QUARK SON OF KELDAR@{ub}

    Personnel, Kli/Fer, rare FA/DS9

    Integrity 5
    Cunning 7
    Strength 4

    CIVILIAN, Leadership, Computer Skill x2, Honor, Greed,
    All attributes +3 if with Grilka. Staff Star (+).

@{i}"QUARK wedded Grilka by brek'tal ritual to head the House of Kazok (as the
house of Quark) on Qo'noS. The Ferengi saved his be'nal from financial
ruin."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why is everyone bashing this card? It's not that bad. Granted, it's no Mogh,
but then the Klingons are not that well-equipped in the skills department
and this Quark guy has a few benefits as well. First, you can use him for
that extra outpost you might want to seed. Yes, you could use Garak for this
purpose, but the Klingons are not exactly underdeveloped in SECURITY, and
the second Computer Skill plus the additional Leadership and Greed make for
some interesting skills.

First, Quark allows you to play Latinum Payoff in an Honor deck. The
Klingons with Greed are all from the Duras clan and they are not exactly
honorable. Quark provides the Greed and has Honor, making him eligible for
the various Klingon Honor benefits.

The double Computer Skill is not exactly powerful, however I know quite a
few games when someone scratched his head on how to get by that Ancient
Computer someone forgot under that lucrative mission ;-) Okay, then
Leadership. Klingons have enough of that, but in a CIVILIAN? Right, unusual
combination. And (thanx to Thomas Warwick for that idea) you can use Quark
in an unusual way there.

Scenario: Tom played a Klingon deck against a Feddie who had superior ships
and was a notorious user of that nasty Wartime Conditions card. Tom gained a
local advantage with a Husnock and was really eager to hit that ship over
there. Well, what did he do? He beamed off the Klingons, switched Quark to
Ferengi and fired. His opponent was now faced with the choice of playing a
Wartime Conditions against the Ferengi affiliation. Needless to say he
didn't do it.

Oh, the 5/7/4 is nothing to write home about but fireproof (both Firestorm
and Thought Fire) and well, the attribute bonuses if with Grilka are not
really top (even if we get Grilka).

But we have a card with a few uses if your decks are not exactly mainstream
and this alone makes the card interesting ;-)

 * Quark Son of Keldar + Latinum Payoff in an Honor deck.

Hi, folks,

I know I'm adopting Decipher style here (delivering late all the time) but
then it's as with Decipher: Too many ideas, too few resources...

Internet Expansion 4 - 8th place - Author: Bryan Ourso


    @{b}SEVENTH GUARANTEE@{ub}

    Interrupt

Plays immediately after your opponent recieves points from one of your
dilemmas. Those points are nullified.

@{i}"One of the founding principles of the Constitution of the United
Federation, based upon the United States Constitution, is the protection
against self-incrimination."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitely a new idea and a somewhat cool one, too. Especially against these
pesky space decks. Load up your space missions with Cytherians and don't
even care about those fat point boxes. Yes, he might make it to the end of
the spaceline. He might even waste a Transwarp Conduit or a pair of
Wormholes on it. But who says you have to give him the points? ;-)

But of course you can do better. There are these Borg hunter decks.
Especially the Klingon Armada style ones. Now you can counteract them by
preceding his Borg with a Borg of your own (important - it has to be your
Dilemma). And when he finally gets that suicide attack through and blows
both the Borg and his Armada to pieces, just grin and show him your small
surprise. I bet he'll hate you for that ;-)

On the other hand if you're not after the spectacular successes, you can
protect yourself against a Royale side game gone wrong or you just deprive
your opponent of the 5 points he just wasted a turn on by listening to your
Sarjenka's plea...

Oh, when you're at it, throw in a Parallax Arguer. After all, it is cool to
deprive your opponent of a handful of points. And if he doesn't consider it
that cool, just show him how much fun a Kivas on his turn is. And that's
cool again, so why not repeat the process? ;-)

Oh, and a last application and that one is weird: You urgently need your
Bendii-infected Sarek to solve Wormhole Negotiations next turn and win the
game. Then your opponent hits The Higher... the Fewer. Probably the only
situation where you'd want to nullify negative points ;-)

Hi.

Um,

Is this thing on? :)

Well, if you haven't guessed already, it's Allen, not Wesley. (and if you
hadn't guessed by this point, you've really got to get out more). (Of
course, those on the newsgroup probably have no clue who I am. But that's OK
- as long as you know it isn't Wes, you're OK. Puff is bouncing these
messages to the group for me, since my access is FUBARed.)

Anyways, to the point. Wesley is off on his well-earned vacation, but he
drive-by emailed me some COTDs to keep us busy. And since I get to mail
them, I also get to do the new openings, and fiddle here :-) (Wes, hope you
don't mind - you did say I could finish them :) If you're a COTD purist,
just ignore my notes - they'll be in []s..

But on with the show:

Hi, folks,

I might be gone but my image is still around to cause COTDs and similar

    @{b}SESKA@{ub}

    Personnel, non-aligned, IE4

    Integrity 4
    Cunning 10
    Strength 5

    ENGINEER, Treachery x2, Computer Skill, Greed.
    May espionage any Federation mission, Staff Star (+).

@{i}"Ensign Seska, a physically altered Cardassian, infiltrated the Maquis and
later betrayed the crew of the USS Voyager."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh yeah, a non-aligned treacherous Engineer. Great stuff. Or so you might
say. Well, Seska's skills are nothing to write home about but she is a
living Espionage card and this of course helps you a lot.

First, use her in an Espionage deck. You don't need to stock two or three
Espionage vs. Fed cards, instead one Seska will do the trick everywhere. And
as you're playing Espionage, you won't have to worry much about Dilemmas,
after all you should know what you seeded.

But there's an even better idea. Don't just throw her into an Espionage
deck, no, play the best missions of two affiliations with just a single
affiliation in your crew. The only catch is you cannot use Federation as
your crew affiliation. Which is a small fact I really like as the Feds have
the best skills and the enhanced mission selection options with Seska give
the other affiliations a slightly easier time thus balancing the
affiliations another bit more.

I really like her for her balancing effects and for the much simpler way to
espionage against people (although Mot can confirm it's already easy to be
espionaged against ;-) ). But the real power of Seska lies in the fact that
she's a two to three card advantage in an Espionage deck. And you know the
importance of card advantage ;-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Seska + Romulan crew + opponent playing Feds ;-)

[Here's a stray thought - to attempt a mission, you must have one personnel
of the correct affiliation. Espionage cards allow you to use a different
affiliation. But here's a non-aligned personnel that lets you espionage Fed
missions. Which to my mind means that there's no need for an aligned
personnel. One step closer to the mythic Non-Aligned deck?]

Hi, folks,

as it's almost traditional for an Internet Expansion, a two-card combo made
it into the top 10:

Internet Expansion IV, 6th place, by Maelwys


    @{b}DIXON HILL@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 8
    Strength 7

    CIVILIAN, Diplomacy, Leadership, Sleuth,
    CUNNING +2 if on ship with Holodeck

@{i}"JEAN-LUC PICARD often went to the holodeck to relax, taking on the role of
Dixon Hill in his favorite Holo-novels."@{ui}


    @{b}SHERLOCK HOLMES@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation

    Integrity 8
    Cunning 12
    Strength 8

    CIVILIAN, Honor, Leadership, Sleuth,
    CUNNING +2 if on ship with Holodeck

@{i}"When Lt. Cmdr. DATA wanted to experience humanity more, he went to the
holodeck and played the part of Sherlock Holmes."@{ui}


Sleuth skill: Once per game, personnel may "figure out" a way to eliminate
one requirement from any mission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again a pair of persona cards for Picard and Data (we have seen the
Romulan versions in an earlier IE set). These have quite unique advantages
and disadvantages.

Disadvantages lie in the more limited skill selection with only two "normal"
skills and the CIVILIAN classification you are not interested in unless
playing Colony or a Naiskos. And it's not that Dipholes were that rare in
the Federation ;-)

The small advantage is the Cunning bonus with a holodeck present. With this
extra, the two detectives have slightly above-standard attributes, but I
guess you by now know that two attribute points don't make that much of a
difference.

[Well, they make a difference, but most people don't tune Away Teams to the
point of planning to beat a dilemma by exact amounts. Also, quick notes:
both are Yuta- and Firestorm-proof.]

The interesting feature is the Sleuth skill. You can with this skill
eliminate any one mission requirement. Try that with Study Stellar Collision
and you have a really easy mission ;-) But you can also use this skill in a
very sneaky way in order to make your opponent's life miserable. He's using
a Klingon honor deck to solve Wormhole Negotiations? Reduce that one to
Diplo x5 OR Treachery x4 and he'll have a hard time getting it done. Or
remove the Data requirement from your opponent's Investigate Time Continuum.

But in spite of all this, the usual application of the Sleuth cards is to
remove a requirement from a mission that contradicts your deck theme. You
have an Engineering deck and suddenly need Exobiology x3. Sleuth it away and
you can solve your mission. Or when you are drastically low on attributes,
you can also do something there. Not the worst idea I've ever seen ?

[Many of the raters noted that this new Sleuth skill was too powerful,
mainly because it's Fed only. While I think the Feds as an affiliation have
an advantage in the straight-out race, the other affiliations do have some
very sneaky abilities denied to Starfleet. And given the number of
successful non-blue decks, I think that the difference is shrinking all the
time. Which to me says that these two cards aren't that bad, especially
considering you have to give up Data and Picard to get them (persona rule,
remember?). And in most situations, I'd take Data over Holmes. The
Picard/Dixon question is a little closer - depends on the deck. And you can
always use Riker as a Picard substitute to cover while ol' baldy plays
make-believe. :)]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * (Allen, can you think one up ?)

[Um... well, let's try these.]

 * Dixon/Holmes + any one-skill mission (Q's Planet, Study Stellar
   Collision, etc.) = very easy requirements.
 * Dixon/Holmes + Major Rakal + Quash Conspiracy : remove that nasty
   Integrity requirement.
 * the aforementioned Dixon/Holmes + Somebody else's Investigate Time
   Continuum: since you have Holmes instead of Data, no sense letting this
   just sit, right?
 * even better = Holmes/Dixon + opponent's Pegasus Search : wait for your
   opponent to get his Interphase Generator. Remove that offending
   requirement after the OR. Smile.

Greetings, all you groovy people. (It's been one of those days.:)

Before I kick in the EHW, a notice to those who may not know:

I Am Not Wesley Crusher. :)

It's amazing, folks - I've only done two issues, and I've already got people
asking to become raters, and all sorts of things. I'm just the temp, folks.
If you'd like to become a rater, ask Wes. Preferably when he gets back from

Hi, folks,

here's the opposite of Warped Space:

Internet Expansion IV, 5th place, by Pakled Captain.


    @{b}CHART EXPANSE@{ub}

    Mission - Federation/Klingon - Space - Span 7-X

@{i}"Necrite Expanse: Find shortcut through vast anomaly."@{ui}

Navigation x 2 + Stellar Cartography + Astrophysics
[35 Points] If you solve, X=5

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Quick note - on the submission the raters got, the skill requirement was
"Navigation x2 + Stellar Cartography - Astrophysics" (note the - sign). Many
(including myself) wanted to know if this meant that you had to have no
Astrophysics present to solve. What it is was a typo in the submission or
Wes' retype. But it's a cool idea, for those who care to write it down for
IE5. Anyways, some ratings may reflect whatever impression they got from the
- sign.]

4 skills including a double Navigation requirement is not too easy a mission
with just a 35 score. But then there's the catch with the Span. A 7 span is
a hefty spaceline blocker (highly efficient against those notorious Husnock
users ;-) ) and you should be able to find uses for that (for example how
about slapping a Gaps in Normal Space on it ?)

[Actually, the Navigation is the least of your worries. I mean, I can't
remember the last time I was stuck for a Navigation skill. (Well OK. Maybe
once.) And Cartography and Astrophysics are in enough missions, that this
mission could fit very nicely into the scheme of things. So I think 35
points is about right - 40 would be too much.]

The only problem with this blocker is you get blocked yourself. While you
can eliminate part of this problem by seeding the card in a location where
you think it hurts your opponent more than yourself, the better way is to
solve the mission and gain a substantial speed advantage (especially if you
managed to surround the Expanse with Span 3 cards - you can jump 3-2-3 with
any Range 8 ship while your opponent will have to stop twice on a 3-7-3
unless he's using AU ships.

Affiliation-wise the mission is a bit better suited for Feds than for
Klingons although both have a three person solution available. Nice and
balanced card, but it requires some combos to make maximum use of it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Chart Expanse + Gaps in Normal Space.
 * [Deck design - go Colony, use Chart Expanse as one of your roadblocks.
   It's better than two spaces, since it requires most of your RANGE to
   get over. Add in FGC-47, a lot of Space, and your planet. Could buy you
   the turn or two you need to win.]
 * Chart Expanse + opponent's Husnock or any damaged ship. Dead stop. :)
   [Which lends itself to a Klingon assault deck. Catch your opponent on
   the wrong side of the expanse, damage as many as you can, pick them off
   at your leisure.]

Hi, folks,

it's really funny to get a good submission from a totally unknown STCCG
player every now and then:

[.. and also proves that a fresh perspective goes a long way - congrats,
Jenny.]

Internet Expansion IV, 4th place, by Jenny Sieman


    @{b}CALL OF DR. SOONG@{ub}

    Event, rare

Play at one planet location. All androids are disabled until brought to that
location.

@{i}"Data once took over the U.S.S. Enterprise and answered Dr. Soong's call
when Dr. Soong activated a signal to Data. Unfortunately, Lore answered the
call as well."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one is a very powerful deck hoser. You all know these decks all too
reliant on lots of Androids to provide Integrity for Q Dilemmas or CIVILIANs
for Colonies. And this is the ultimate anti-android card. You play it on a
planet (stock a Q's Planet for this purpose if you want to play space
missions) as far away as possible from your opponent's androids. And then
you watch your opponent squirm as he tries to get his deck back to work
without too much success (at least if you can defend the Event with Q2s or
Rishon).

And unfortunately that's pretty much all I have to say. The card is very
close to being broken as it can shut down an entire deck. And even if it
only takes out two or three personnel unless your opponent takes a six turn
side trip to reactivate his androids, it is too powerful.

[For the most part, I agree with Wes. This card is very powerful. Of course,
there's a simple solution - don't use androids. Think about it - before QC,
there was Data, and... Data. These days, Finger puzzles and the such are
almost mandatory. Here's a simple way to blow through a bunch of them
easily. Just remember to bring another solution to Security Precautions.]

Well, most raters liked it. I think it's an example of a card too strong.
We'd need a very effective counter-card for this but then we'd just wind up
having both players assigning fixed slots in their tents (or playing
completely without androids). Sorry, Jenny, a bit too powerful :-(

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * None.
 * [Well, I'll throw in a mean one: Call of Dr. Soong + Investigate Legend
   - disable 'em, then cloak the planet.]

Hi, folks,

what do you get if you cross a Rogue Borg with a Coalescent Organism?

This:

Internet Expansion IV, 3rd place, by James Kerrigan


    @{b}INTRUDER@{ub}

    Dilemma Planet/Space, Rare.

Plays as a personnel. Attacks one of your personnel present (random
selection), at the end of each of your turns. After three full turns uses
one of your Equipment present (Random selection), as his own. No Leadership
is required, does not stop crew/away team. Discard if 3 Security present.
Strength=8.

@{i}"Intruders often attack crews and away teams one by one, and steal weapons."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An interesting variant on both the Rogue Borg theme and the Coalescent
Organism. Intruder is placed on the ship and starts battling each turn.
Thus, if you don't have any personnel with STRENGTH > 8 you'll lose all your
crew.
......
A*#!$afd
NO CARRIER
<the Holo-Projector fizzles out, bellowing smoke and sparking in that
wonderful Star Trek tradition>
---
[Hmm.. seems that's the end of the line, folks. Wes warned me this might
happen. So looks like I get to finish. Oh darn. :)]

This was my personal favorite from this year's offerings, since it's a cool
concept with great play potential. And, it's our first true-blue Fed killer.

That's right - finally, we have a killer that targets our Fed's weak spot -
STRENGTH. And while there there is Worf, Data and the STAs to help out, the
Intruder will continue to pick people off until you're lucky enough to have
the Intruder attack them. Teams without those folks (or perhaps your
android's been disabled?) will be forced to evacuate or lose the entire
team.

The Romulans and Klingons won't have nearly as much trouble with this
dilemma, and the STAs take a bite out it's effectiveness in general. Of
course, the 3 SECURITY is the guaranteed killer, but that's something you
don't see all that often..

Some other benefits - it's planet/space, so it's always useful. Plus,
there's the psychological effect of having someone running amok on your
ship. :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * The no-brainer: Interphasic Plasma Creatures + Intruder. Now you need
   personnel with STRENGTH > 10. My quick glance listed only 3 people who
   qualify. Makes those SECURITY a lot more appetizing, n'est pas?
 * Intruder + Rogue Borg: whittle down that crew a little faster..

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #385@{ub}


Hi folks. Well, I have good news, and bad news.

Bad news is, the projector's shot, and I can't fix it (I'm a rater, not an
engineer. :) That means, no more holo-Wesley. Good news is, I've managed to
salvage the silver and gold medal winners for Internet Expansion IV, and
I've managed to put together reviews for them. (So any purists may want to
cover their eyes - this is pretty much all me, little/no Wes. Be gentle,
folks. :)

Anyhoo, it's down to business, and our second place card:

Internet Expansion IV, 2nd place, by Joe Golowka


    @{b}INVASION@{ub}

    Interrupt

Play card at the beginning of your turn. Until end of turn, score one point
for each of opponent's personnel you kill, 10 for each outpost, 6 for each
station, and 5 for each starship. Double points if you have completed
Strategic Diversion. You may not play another Invasion for two full turns.

@{i}"In 2372 the Klingon Empire launched an invasion against the Cardassian
Union. The invasion devestated Cardassia and gave the Klingons new
territory."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, here it is - the logical progression of Latinum Payoff and Klingon
Civil War. For one turn, those armadas become a big point machine. Of
course, there's one catch - you have to catch them first, and there has to
be enough of them out there to kill. And let's be honest - there's a severe
limit to how many points you'll score with this. Most likely, you'll nail an
outpost, two ships, tops. That's 20 points, plus crew (remember that crew -
point a piece). So if you're lucky, you'll net 25-30 points. About as good
as a mission.

Now, before you Klingons out there start getting all excited, you're not
going to be able to win a game with this card. You can only use it every
three turns, but let's face it - your opponent won't have anything worth
shooting at for a long while. If you sacrifice the fleet to a Borg Ship,
you'll get 45 - enough to bring you within 25-30 points of a win. So you'll
still need a mission to win. Of course, it's still worth it, since you were
planning on using that armada anyways, right? :-) So one interrupt for 20
points is a pretty darn good deal in my book.

End result - if you're playing the Armada, stock one or two. At least you'll
score 10 when you take out the outpost. Otherwise, leave it in the box.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Klingon armada + Invasion. (nah, go figure :)
 * Don't forget the ground possibilities: Tasha Alternate + multiple
   Phaser Burns makes for a darn good commando raid at 2 points per Burn.
   :)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #386@{ub}


Well, here it is, folks. Numero uno. The cream of the crop. And a whole
other bunch of cliches that I can't remember off hand. The first place card
of Internet Expansion IV.

The gold medal goes to...

Internet Expansion IV, First place!, by Qume.


    @{b}QUARK'S BAR@{ub}

    Event

When played, both players must shuffle their discard piles into their draw
decks. Discard event.

@{i}"This infamous Deep Space Nine establishment is reknowned for its colorful
clientele and alluring dabo girls. An extremely difficult place for a
gambler to leave while he is ahead."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First off, a note on game play - you shuffle your discard pile into your
draw pile, then you discard Quark's Bar. So the Bar will become the first
card in your discard pile.

The obvious benefit is that you get a longer game, for both players. Which
these days is a good thing - more time to fly around, solve missions, and
blow things up.

The problem is, this card makes speed decks deadly. Two or three Bars, and
you can recycle your deck endlessly. Which means you can go fast. Very fast.
Of course, there's always Uxbridge, but you'll need a couple to totally
shutdown the deck, since if one goes through, he'll get the rest back. Just
truly nasty.

I don't think we'll ever see this card in a set as is - most likely, there'd
need to be a "not duplicable" on it, to prevent those recursive decks. None
the less, it's very very cool.

A more esoteric use (meaning one that'll never get used) is that it shuffles
your deck, in case you've been Thought Maker'ed, or just having a bad draw.

All in all, a fairly straightforward card.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Quark's Bar + Quark's Bar: infinite draw pile.
 * The Evil Ultimate Speed Deck(tm): 3 Bars, Horga'hn, Traveler, Kivas,
   Red Alert, add missions to taste. Go as fast as you want, for as long
   as you want. Forget the Tent - you won't need it.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #387@{ub}


Hi, folks,

after a long absence (yes, even STCCG Ambassadors want to have their summer
holiday ;-) ) I am back, in real, more failure-proof than the Emergency
Holographic Wesley which seemed to have had a pretty short lifespan - guess
you can't just program that much STCCG into a stable holocharacter ;-)

So where did I leave off before I left? Oh right, Internet Expansion 4. But
that one seemed to have run its course. So what was before that? Umm
(checking old logs) - Anthology preview cards. Let's jump back in there...


    @{b}ORB OF PROPHECY AND CHANGE@{ub}

    Artifact, rare First Anthology / DS9

Use as Equipment card. Once each turn, you may glance at the top card of
your draw deck. Insert it anywhere within your draw deck if you wish. (Not
duplicatable).

@{i}"Third of the nine mysterious energy vortices called Tears of the Prophets
by the Bajorans. Grants visions of the future. Only Orb not stolen by
Cardassians during the occupation."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't help thinking of a dj vu with this card, seems to me as if I did
it before, but the COTD archive does not know anything about Orbs, so I'll
believe it.

First, it's a beautiful implementation of the theme. Rare is the STCCG card
whose title translates this nicely into a game effect. We have the "Orb"
(which has to be a non-duplicatable Artifact as it is a unique item of
incredible value) "of Prophecy" (you get to see which card you are going to
draw next) "and Change" (and you can actually change your future by moving
this card to a place in your draw deck where it suits you much better.

So your basic net effect is you get the better of two cards into your hand
at the end of each turn (if you guess right). This is quite a powerful
effect, however it looks a bit pale compared to the Traveler where you
actually get both cards, not just the one you like better. However, the Orb
still has its advantages. First, in the middle to late game you are no
longer much concerned about drawing many cards, actually you will usually
want to avoid drawing too many cards in order to make sure you do not draw
out too soon. But you will quite often need that one crucial card (a
replacement for a lost classification, a ship or whatever). So with the Orb,
you can double your chances at drawing the crucial card and yet keep your
deck exhaustion rate at one per turn.

What else? One good use is to move two Q's tents to the bottom of your deck
and then start to tent at random. If you can construct a 28-card draw deck
with all necessary cards, you can draw these 28 at an amazing speed using
Kivas and then take up to 26 turns with your complete deck available as
resources in which to win by tenting at random and redrawing the tent. If
your tent provides a steady stream of good personnel for example, this
strategy can prove to be very powerful. Or, speaking of Q's tents, if you
tent at random and got the card you wanted, why not use the Orb to move the
just-returned tent a few places down to make sure you draw something more
useful on the next turn...

But whatever use you take, the Orb pales a bit compared to the Betazoid Gift
Box. To be a fully comparable Artifact, the Orb would have to have twice the
power - look at two cards and put them into any place in your deck. Well,
not completely crappy, and a BGB replacement for those who don't have this
power card and it has a few special uses. But then, not a top notch card
either. Oh, one last use: You just Kivased and drew a tent and are now faced
with the decision "Tent or draw?" Well, the Orb might help you make that
decision...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * The Orb + Q's Tent - in pretty any application scenario.

Hi, folks,

I know I'm always neglecting my STCCG roots with all this ISOWC, Hall of
Fame and similar stuff going on, but here's one more ;-) For those of you
who are

regularly checking back issues on the website, note the change in address,
BTW - Lennard's provider has changed, so the pages moved with him.


    @{b}THOMAS PARIS@{ub}

    Personnel, Non-aligned, rare FA / VOY.

    Integrity 5
    Cunning 6
    Strength 7

    CIVILIAN, Navigation x2, Transporter Skill, SECURITY,
    Treachery (may convert to Honor for rest of game), Staff Star, AU icon.

@{i}"Convicted traitor. Maquis sympathizer. Best pilot Harry Kim has ever seen.
In an alternate reality, a bar fight cost Tom Paris his future aboard the
U.S.S. Voyager."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And yet another new dual classification for the Naiskos fans among us. And
for exactly these guys, Tom has another nice bonus - his AU icon which mean
you can stuff him into the nearest Cryo and uncover him along with the
Artifact. As for other skills, you get the, well, not-so-great-yet
Transporter Skill (although Mot recently uncovered a few semi-decent uses
for beaming prevention cards) and a double Navigation. The latter is not
that bad if you build a deck around increasing your travel speed while
slowing your opponent's movement. Just add FGC-47 and you'll have a decent
movement advantage. Not that you'd want to necessarily solve FGC-47 ;-). But
as a Dilemma sucker and one-sided spaceline blocker that mission has its own
merits. Of course in this strategy you might also want to have a Near-Warp
transport or two, giving Tom's Transporter skill even a slightly useful
aspect.

Last, the Treachery / Honor thing. Try this with Romulans. There are several
decent missions for the Rommies that require one Honor, but Rommies with
Honor usually s*ck and then, all these missions with Treachery just wait to
be solved. Or, if your opponent is notoriously good at guessing Outpost Raid
right, play Klingon and have a single Treachery mission as your outpost
location. Your opponent will most probably pay no attention to it (hey, you
are playing a Diphole deck), so just place your outpost there and grab a
quick 35 or 40 before he even noticed what happened. Then switch Tom and
continue in your regular Diphole ways. Maybe not the all-out power
personnel, but a good incarnation of Tom and a lot of flavor on the card.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Thomas Paris + honorable Klingons + Pegasus Search or Plunder Site

And now for a totally different idea: Right after I released the Mannheim

cards to overcome the "reviewable cards" shortage. Well, I'll leave it up to
you. If the majority wants to see some reviews of Mannheim cards I will
review a number of those. If you'd prefer real cards (however I think there
are less than 15 review-worthy cards left), I'll do my best to find the most
interesting ones out of the not yet done 240.

Hi, folks,

    @{b}ENSIGN TUVOK@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, rare, FA / VOY

    Integrity 6
    Cunning 8
    Strength 7

    SCIENCE, Astrophysics, Mindmeld, Youth, Once per game, may cancel a
    battle at same Nebula. Staff Star, AU Icon, TOS icon.

@{i}"29-year-old Vulcan of first deep space assignment aboard Captain Sulu's
U.S.S. Excelsior in 2293. Joined Starfleet under pressure from his parents."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hmmm, Astrophysics and Youth, eh? And Integrity 6, Cunning 8 and a Staff
Star to boot... Wonder where I've seen this before ;-) Which leads me to a
decent use for our Tuvok: Use him as a Wesley replacement in a
Cryosatellite. Together with Rachel Garrett, Tuvok is everything you need to
gain 60 points, as Rachel can solve Restore Errant Moon and Tuvok can solve
Plasma Streamer. Do I hear a cry for a Cryosatellite under Wormhole
Negotiations? Concentrate your deck on Dilemma-solvers and Diplomats and
then use Tuvok and Rachel to finish it. Easy enough. And
Revolving-Door-proof.

What else? SCIENCE? Actually, if I want him for his SCIENCE, I usually have
better choices, skill-wise. Dr. Reyga, Vekor and Neela Daren are all truly
decent Scientists. But better than OFFICER at least and also again provides
for a Wesley alternative in case you need Youth along with your Astrophysics
and already have abundant ENGINEERs.

Mindmeld? Ho-hum. Maybe useful with Wormhole Negotiations or some other
mission that has a high multiplier after a requirement. That is if you can
pull that Vulcan Mindmeld card.

And his special ability is a small defense bonus. Not that too many people
would play with one of the Nebula missions or the common Nebula card. And
not that canceling one battle per game would be the power you absolutely
need (if you do, try Guilty-Provisionally). But it does more than a blank
line. However it also provides that extra dot for the Bailiff. Oh well,
maybe once before 2000 I will actually pull it off. That is if I even use
the card before 2000 ;-)

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #390@{ub}


Hi, folks,

yes, I sent out my ratings request too late, so sorry. Sue me ;-) Well, now
that I again have a few ratings, let's jump right into something cool. Or is
it cool? Arguable.


    @{b}PARALLAX ARGUERS@{ub}

    Interrupt, common QC.

If that was cool, X=5. OR If you just argued, play an Event card now (X=0).
OR Nullifies Parallax Arguers (X=Opponent's Arguers points +5) [X]

@{i}"At the Parallax Colony, one couple spent their lives endlessly
contradicting each other, despite Alexander's reminding them about the
higher... the fewer."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This card was always a cool [5] reason to argue. With just these few words,
Decipher cool[10]ly set off the most heated rules argument series [Did I say
Argument? Drought Tree. 17] in the history of our game.

In the early days, players had really cool [22] application ideas for the
card. The earliest implementation was the nothing-but-arguers deck, inspired
by the rule sheet wording that could be misread as that only the player
playing the PA would declare what was cool [27] or not. Then came the
somewhat more advanced 5-0 deck. Innocently play an Arguer on the first turn
stating "It is cool [32] that I might now get a chance to play this great
event I have here." If he agrees, fine, grab the 5, if not, put a cool [37]
smile on your face and play Kivas, followed by more Arguers. Unless your
opponent stays cool [42 - hey that's a cool [47] number] you will get to
score points at some time. Hey, and 5-0 is also a win.

Of course these don't win you a tourney. But then, there were sneakier
applications. Scenario: Tourney. Opponent plays something obviously legal on
turn 1. You say "Hey, you can't do that". Unless he's really cool [52] and
calls the judge, he'll reply "Sure can". You say "No", he says "Yes" and
that's an Argument. Red Alert and on turn one you plop down your entire
crew. Cool [57].

Okay, the last one is now (thankfully) forbidden. Arguments [Oh, while we're
at it: Plant another tree - 64] can now only be counted for the PA if the
subject of the argument is whether something was cool [69] or uncool.

So the PA remains a card that leaves the opponent a nasty choice - allow you
a free 5 points or a free Event play. Throw Event wrenches into your
opponent's plans at Interrupt speed or just get out that Kivas without
losing a turn. But nonetheless as a speed card, the PA has only limited use.
True, you get an extra card play, but the bottleneck of an STCCG deck is
often not the card play but the draw. And in this respect, the PA can be as
cool [74] as it wants to, it just costs you a draw. Not so hot [Waitasec,
not so hot means the same as cool. 79]

Of course you can always hope for these games where not only you but also
your opponent have a few PA in the deck. Your opponent does something and
declares it cool [so he also gets 5] and you agree that that is really cool,
but it would be even cooler that you now get 10 for nullifying his PA [89].
Not to be outdone, your opponent throws another PA [back to 79, and him to
15] your way which you counter - you guess it - with a fourth PA [99]. Oh,
99? Tebok will definitely confirm that this is a cool number ;-) [104].

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Let's get a bit more serious here: PA + Supernova. Instant 5 points. Or
   instant BOOM.
 * PA + Interrogation: How many points do you see?
 * PA + Kivas: The best deck if your only aim is not to lose.

Hi, folks,

a typical attempt at writing COTD:

(Okay, let's sit down and write this thing. Just log into chat so I can see
what's going on)
"Hey Wes, good to see you, just wanted to tell you my Hall of Fame score was
misrecorded there"
(Grumble, let's fix that - it'll take only 10 minutes and then I can...)

"Hi Wes - can you help me with that JavaScript ?"
(Okay, he did me a favor lately, so I guess I'll have to help here)
"Wes, don't forget the newsletter page that's due tomorrow"
(Oops, thanx for reminding me and hey, I already got 6 words of my COTD
written, so let's do that first)
(But now let's log out. Only check mail first.)
"Can you come to the chat - it's HIM again and he's annoying everyone"
(Grrr, as if I needed that. ALT/TAB, New Window, move back there...
Nothing in sight except...)
"Hey, good you're here ! Our judge for our ISOWC game didn't turn up and
we're already one hour late."
(AAARRRGGGHHH, can't they... Oh well, what the...)
(During the game:)
"Did my mail on XYZ arrive ?" "The judge program crashed when I judged two
weeks ago..."
(Mail notifier: Matt Mariani)
"Oh Wes, while you're at it, I need the advance info on next Saturday's
Regional"
(Open yet another window. You guessed it. CRASH.)
(Reboot, relogin, explain ISOWCers I crashed, try to catch up with the game,
finally finish it, look at clock)
***HOW LATE ????? 2AM ?????***
(Next morning, first thing)
"Hey Wes, when's the next COTD coming out ?" *T*I*L*T*

(not very far from what actually in RL happened yesterday night ;-) )

And while we're at things I never got around to do: I overlooked this one
all the time...


    @{b}ALIEN PARASITES@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet, uncommon.

Unless INTEGRITY > 32, Away Team infected. They beam back and opponent
immediately controls ship and crew until "stopped". Then turn resumes.

@{i}"Intelligent parasites enter and take control of a humanoid. Their presence
can be detected by a gill like protrusion on the back of a host's neck."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the one card to use against those opponents who love redshirting. Or
of course against those who just love green cards. For the latter type,
here's a great one: Seed Yuta, Armus and Alien Parasites. With Yuta, take
out a high Integrity guy who's not vital to the mission requirements. Armus
kills off the next one, and with any luck the away team is now below 32
INTEGRITY but still capable of solving the mission. They hit the Parasites
and you thank your opponent for the points and the Artifact. Oh, and if you
have some extra seeding room, add a Q-Flash. In the unlikely case he
actually has the 32 INTEGRITY, he'll have to cope with a decent number of
Q-cards.

Now of course you can't assume your opponent is going to play green, but in
the times of Yuta/Barclay and Brain Drain, very few people risk a planet
deck without redshirts. And a redshirt at the right time can be very
expensive. Here's a few ideas what to do with a crew that's temporarily
yours...

 * Solve the mission your opponent just wanted to score. Always a good
   idea, not only do you get the points, you also get to do one of the
   other nasty things as well as you are not stopped.
 * Move them somewhere and run them into a Dilemma that you know is going
   to kill them. Barclay's Disease works well (be kind enough to leave
   that one single SECURITY aboard ship ;-) ). Careful, Yuta and Q will
   not have the desired effects ! (Think about it)
 * Just move them to a neighboring planet where you happen to have an away
   team of your own. Attack with just enough people to lose. Move the ship
   away, exhausting its range. On your turn, attack back. At least two
   people out of the picture. Too bad they were your opponent's key crew
   ;-)
 * As good: Move the ship into the range of your own one. Then attack and
   damage it a bit. You should be able to finish it off before it gets
   back to the outpost.
 * In case you can't do anything better: Move them as far away as you can,
   of course in the direction your opponent will not want to see them.
   Then try to stop the crew by attempting something, just to make sure he
   can't try and attempt a mission.
 * Works only if the affiliation is right: Attempt your own missions and
   get rid of a few nasty Dilemmas. After all, you can afford to lose a
   few people here ;-)

So with all these possibilities, why don't people play it more often ?
Simple. It is Planet only, thus useless if your opponent plays pure space.
But there's one place where Alien Parasites is a very good card: In a Q's
Tent, waiting for Q's Planet. After all, what is better than stopping your
opponent from getting that key Artifact ? Right. Getting it yourself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Alien Parasites + (opponent's) Q's Planet
 * Yuta + Armus + Love Interests + Alien Parasites.

Hi, folks,

Decipher is finally moving and getting new cards out and what better thing
to do than start reviewing them early so that when you finally hold these
cool things in your greedy hands you know what to do with them...

Our first Fajo Sneak Peek:


    @{b}TALLERA@{ub}

    Personnel, Romulan/Federation/Non-Aligned, ultra-rare FJ.

    Integrity 3
    Cunning 7
    Strength 7

    SECURITY, Computer Skill, SCIENCE, Mindmeld, Leadership,
    Treachery, Command Star (*).

    Does not work with [Fed] affiliation personnel.

@{i}"Female Romulan mercenary. In reality a physically altered Vulcan
isolationist seeking the stone of Gol."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Sorry Major, I know you've done her before, but I disagree with you in a
few points anyway and besides, you can't just keep all that Fajo glamor for
yourself just because you don't need to collect ratings...)

First of all, let's forget about all that fancy Affiliation stuff and let's
look at Tallera as if she were a basic non-aligned card with the Galen /
Locarno restriction. Basically, like in those two, everyone but the blue
guys (who do have enough great personnel anyway) gets a really decent
personnel card. Best thing, Tallera is a good SECURITY. Usually, everyone
but the Klingon players (who have Governor Worf and Mogh) goes through their
cards, picks out a Roga Danar and then curses because she has no second good
SECURITY . But now with Tallera, this choice gets a good bit easier. Having
SECURITY and SCIENCE is a rather new combination, but it is every bit as
powerful as the well-liked other SCIENCE / something combos as found in
Vekor, Dr. Reyga and Dr. R'Mor. Even better, SCIENCE is mostly a
space-oriented classification and Tallera's SCIENCE can't be nuked by space
nasties like Rascals and Tsiolkovsky Infection. (Her Computer Skill however
is often useful on planets but not that needed in space.)

Besides that, we get Leadership for battles (combined with a 7 Strength this
is not too bad and I know quite a few Romulan decks that found themselves in
a situation where they would have liked to pull off a quick space battle and
found they lacked the second leader required to fire with both ships) and
the all-too-common Treachery. But with all those missions that have a
Treachery x2 or even x4 requirement, I doubt this is useless (Ha, I said it
;-) ). Lastly Mindmeld. Until now, this skill was a purely Feddie affair,
but with our new card, the other affiliations can now get the super-powered
skill multiples as well, and trust me, you will appreciate this at latest
when you hit a Shaka and once again have only a lone Sela or Sirol in play
to provide any Diplomacy...

But that was just the basics.

However, Tallera can do more because of all those shiny affiliation icons.
Stick her with a Romulan team and you have one less worry about getting
enough green guys in your redshirt strategy. Stick her with some Klingons
and seed that second outpost. And best, put her in a deck with a whole
truckload of non-aligneds and use all that beautiful Federation equipment
and while you're at it, bring in a blue ship or two as well... Oh, and of
course there are those Federation missions of your opponent just waiting to
be espionaged against...

She's a versatile, multipurpose card and will definitely find a way in more
than just one or two of my decks (Jason, care to slip me an advance copy so
that I can start creaming a few more adversaries ? ;-) )

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Tallera + Non-aligneds + Opponent's Fed mission
 * Tallera + Romulans + Vulcan Mindmeld

Hi, folks,

well, what should I say? The cards are out there... And not just cards but
GREAT CARDS. So what better thing to do than take one of these babies and
pick it apart a bit... And as we now know 13 Fajo cards, let's start with
one that has a 13 on it.


    @{b}LORE@{ub}

    Personnel, non-aligned, ultra-rare FJ.

    Integrity 1
    Cunning 13
    Strength 12

    CIVILIAN, ENGINEER, Computer Skill, Treachery x2, SECURITY,
    Transporter Skill, Leadership.
    Doubles all Rogue Borg and Crystalline Entities in play.
    Command Star (*), Nemesis Icon: Dr. Soong.

    Does not work with [Fed] affiliation.

@{i}"Evil Soong-type Android. Data's 'elder brother'"@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, we all know six-skill cards get the hype and also somehow dual
classification cards are not that bad. Here it gets even better. Not two but
three classifications adorn Lore's game text and nicely enough, two of them
are SECURITY and ENGINEER. We have seen that before, on Roga Danar, but Lore
just packs a lot more punch. He shares the Computer Skill and Leadership
with Roga (vital for Romulan R'Mor decks that need this combination for
Investigate Shattered Space) and instead of the Biology you get two
Treachery, Transporter Skill and the CIVILIAN. Now before anyone starts
trying to build three-person Naiskos teams: No way. The only combo that
would right now be viable would be Lore + Vekor + Major Rakal, but this
would require Rakal to be in Fed mode and then she cannot work with Lore.
(Well, to be exact, there is a three-person Naiskos team that does not even
involve any Fajo cards, but this requires you to have a fourth personnel in
play - guesses can be mailed to my address).

But wait... Did I say SIX skills? Hey, this would not be a Fajo card if we
could not do better than the existing stuff. Let's say we take SEVEN skills
and just for fun (Hey, we need that third line, so we can as well fill it)
make it a special ability. Doubles Rogue Borg and Crystalline Entities in
play. Well, in play, not on your side, but who's gonna play Rogue Borg just
in the hope you use Lore? So the Rogue Borg deck again becomes a viable
design. Have a non-nullifyable doubler out and you can always pack a Crosis
on top of it. Two RB and one Crosis with Lore, a nice 36 Strength. Pack
another Rogue Borg and you have 64 Strength! And the second half of the
special ability? Double Crystalline Entity. Looks a bit weird as until now
doubling a Dilemma always meant doubling the effect but killing everyone
twice is not very sensible, so what is left are the requirements and points.
Suddenly Cystalline Entity becomes a formidable card, requiring Music x2 or
SHIELDS >12 in Space (that's Borg Ship level, folks) or SEC x2 + MED x2 on a
Planet. Ouch ;-)

Oh, I forgot the new icon. The Nemesis icon will obviously allow a character
to enter a kind of an epic battle with his nemesis, in our case Dr. Soong.
(BTW, from an unnamed but reliable source I got a between-the-lines
indication this icon might be a small disadvantage.) What the exact mechanic
will be we can only guess, so expect a minor revision on this article
someday, but even without it: Incredible card. And to think that was one of
the least innovative Fajo designs...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Lore + Crosis: Double doubles means quadrupled Ouch

Hi, folks,

before I head off to Vegas to give my cards a serious workout, let's quickly
take a look at this:


    @{b}DIXON HILL'S BUSINESS CARD@{ub}

    Interrupt/Event, ultra-rare FJ.

Interrupt: If any mug (what ain't Swedish) just got iced and there weren't
no witnesses, finger any udda mug what's woikin' for da same boss. Put da
bag on 'im.

Event: Plays on da table. The udda boss' next mug what shows up has gotta be
universal or hologrammatical den put dis card outta commission (No
duplicatin' dis here event.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow, first card in English many native English speakers don't understand at
all. I already see the rules questions (Hi Major ;-) ) Let's translate and
check what we can do:

Interrupt: If any non-Borg personnel just died alone, take any other
personnel belonging to the same player captive.

So much for the LocaR'Mor deck! This design built around redshirts and two
important characters has just received a big dampener. Send your us***s (Hi
Mot ;-) ) Takket to clear out a Dilemma or two for you and POOF (Hi Puff ;-)
), there goes your R'Mor. So if you plan on doing some redshirting, you'd
better stock a few Rescue Captives so you can get your core crew back once
you're done clearing Dilemmas.

But we can also get sneaky. Assuming we want to do some redshirting, why not
score a few points off our dead (and in the process get a personnel back to
the place we want to have him)? As soon as one of our guys bites the dust,
play a Business card to capture one of your own people (preferably the vital
character who just hit a Love Interest). Play an Interrogation on him, score
10 and put him back on your outpost. Especially useful whey you're stuck at
99 (Hi Tebok ;-) ).

Event: Play on table. The next personnel opponent reports must be universal
or a hologram. (Not duplicatable as an Event)

Goodbye Bridge Crew deck! No universal personnel might as well mean no
personnel at all if you get stuck with this against you. So at least keep
that Vekor and your backup STA handy (or of course a Holo - Hi Tomek ;-) )
Of course this variant of the card is pretty straightforward. The less
universal crew your opponent has, the more vulnerable he is. And you can
always Palor this card back once or twice for the case she really had a
universal crewmember hidden somewhere. At some point she'll run out of
universals and sit there with that disappointed look on her face (Hi Dr.
R'Mor ;-) )

Overall a card that hoses two strategies and thus does not suffer from the
"Yes it's powerful, but it requires my opponent to play a certain tactic"
problem. I can almost see the uses for the puzzle-makers (Hi, Sirna ;-) ) as
well, with a card this complex I'm sure you'll find a lot of uses...

 * The Business Card + Interrogation

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #396@{ub}


Hi, folks,

after the Worlds and the ensuing jetlag, I'm back and ready to try this
review business again (I know I should probably change the title for
consistency but people are used to it, so what the heck.)

Today I'd like to take a look at what is probably the least powerful of the
15 Fajo cards yet seen:


    @{b}DNA METAMORPHOSIS@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet/Space, ultra-rare Fajo.

Place on one personnel present (random selection). At the end of your next
turn, unless MEDICAL and I.P. Scanner present, that personnel is placed in
stasis.

@{i}"Geordi LaForge was infected with alien DNA. Transformed into an invisible
reptilian humanoid, he was observable only when scanned with ultraviolet
light."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At first glance, this Dilemma looks like a heavy hitter. MEDICAL plus I.P.
Scanner is not the thing your opponent usually just has present, so you get
a personnel from him. And with the personnel being in stasis, a few of the
standard rescue measures like Res-Q or just playing another copy of the
personnel are ineffective (the latter only in the case of a unique, of
course). However, the power of the card is severely limited by two factors:

First, it is random. Just targeting one random personnel will usually net
you a redshirt or, if you are very lucky, a Dathon used to overcome a Shaka
while the cards you'd really want are often safe elsewhere on an uninvolved
ship (in which case a killer is not very efficient anyway) or part of a
large crew (in which case your chance of hitting something important is less
than 25%).

Second, you don't get the personnel right there and then. Your opponent has
a full turn and the rest of the current turn to do something about the
problem. And with people starting to stock IP scanners in their Q's tents
for Brain Drain defense, that will usually mean they take a very good look
at the infected personnel and then decide he's either not worth it or play a
tent to grab the IP scanner and play it. True, they'll maybe waste a turn on
getting back to the outpost, but you give them the choice of what hurts them
least. And even if they do consider the personnel vital for the mission,
they get the rest of this turn AND the full next turn to complete the
mission before the targeted card goes out of commission. That means as DNA
Metamorphosis does not stop, you will need something effective enought to
delay your opponent's attempt for two full turns, i.e. either two powerful
stoppers or a good wall. More than you usually can afford under a mission.

Finally, let's compare to a different but similar card: Coalescent Organism.
In both cases, you get rid of a personnel at the end of the following turn
unless your opponent has something there that is absent more often than it
is present.

But with the Coalescent Organism, he will have to deal with the spreading
effect (i.e. isolate the infected personnel), he will be stopped and once
the Dilemma hits, he'll have no chance to cure anything.

Sorry, this is probably one of the visually coolest cards in Fajo, but
gamewise it's the only one of those I've seen I could live without. It
should at least have been opponent's choice to compensate for the lack of
stopping.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

 * Nope.

        @{b}Wesley's STCCG card of the day #397@{ub}


Hi, folks,

a little hint: I see those nasty remarks about delays even if you
don't think I would see them (Hi Copernicus ;-) )

Anyway, here's one for the afterlife:


    @{b}PICARD'S ARTIFICIAL HEART@{ub}

    Q-Artifact, ultra-rare FJ.

Immediately seed under this mission (even if a space mission).
When mission completed (or scouted), owner places in hand until
played as an Interrupt card, once per game, on any one personnel
in play. That personnel dies whenever that personnel's STRENGTH
is used. (May be nullified only by Katherine Pulaski, if present.)

@{i}"You'd might have lived if you'd had a real one instead of this
unreliable piece of technology."@{ui}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First a funny tidbit about this card: This heart (from Tapestry) is the
one Pulaski implanted in Picard and which then failed, but Pulaski can
nullify it (i.e. prevent the failure). Hmmm, isn't that quality control
backwards ?
Gamewise, this card is weird as well. On the one hand it is an Artifact,
acquired only when the mission is completed, but it does not necessari-
ly go to the person who did the mission but usually to his opponent
(assuming the player who first attempted the mission can also complete
it sooner or later). As soon as this happens, the heart gets into the
hand of its owner who can target a vital personnel with it. Usually,
this will be someone who is vital to some mission attempt or Dilemma
solving crew. But be careful. Don't play it right away on someone you
consider vital - the heart is an interrupt which means you can play it
right after a mission attempt was declared and make sure the new user
of the heart will very soon get to test his STRENGTH. A quick Rogue Borg
or five will do that trick best.
However, the classic way to get someone to use his STRENGTH is a Dilemma.
Nagilum, Chalnoth, Nausicaans (thematically fitting), Rebel Encounter,
Ferengi Attack, Malfunctioning Door, Q's Vicious Animal Things and Outpost
Raid are all good at getting someone to show a little muscle, but only the
Raid is Planet and Space, so doing it with Dilemmas requires a little
guesswork on which type of mission your opponent prefers. However, with
a little set-up, Outpost Raid can be turned into a big-time killer.
Remember, you get to pick out the one personnel you like. The personnel
will die, leaving the way wide open for something like a Barclay's
Disease. And it practically can't be nullified. Now those people who
rely on STAs for Barclay protection considering Vekor too problematic
because of the Brain Drain risk are in for a surprise as their MEDICAL
droid exchanges its already mechanical heart for another mechanical
one and promptly dies due to a construction error.
Like most Fajo cards, this is one that requires some major setup, but then
if it doesn't stick, what do you lose ? A Q-card. Great deal, if you're
playing with a Flash in the first place you usually have room for one
more of these. Just don't forget that it's not fast. Your opponent will
get that one mission (or shy away from it if he's really afraid to lose
a key character) before the heart has any effect. But against the right
deck or with the right support combos, this card can be devastating. Just
don't rely on it. More often it will do nothing, but that's the nature of
Q-cards...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite combo(s):

- Picard's Artificial Heart + Outpost Raid (+ Yuta) + Barclay's Disease
  So much for this Away Team or crew.
- Picard's Artificial Heart + Rogue Borg. *BIG* bullseye. Either he does
  not retaliate (which means the RB will stay and stop him forever) or he
  loses the targeted character.

Hi, folks,

I'm gonna make a few people lose their bets today, namely all those who
thought I'd keep this one for #400 ;-)


    @{b}BLACK HOLE@{ub}

    Doorway, Ultra-rare FJ.

Plays between two adjacent "Space" missions. Creates a location with a span
of 1. End of each turn, "pulls in" (destroys) all other cards here. Every
four full turns, also pulls in one adjacent spaceline location (including
all cards there). Alternates, first pulling in the location on your left,
then the one on your right, and so on. (Not duplicatable.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, we all know this card sucks ;-) And why it is a doorway, we can only
speculate. The most probable explanation is that Decipher could not fit all
this text on any other card type...

Okay, alone the Black Hole is rather weak. It just sits there and slowly
removes a few spaces (which also means it forces you to play with a few
Space cards). Its first real power effect occurs on your 13th turn (that is
if you get it out on your first turn) when it finally gets to pull in a real
mission (and by then this will probably be deserted as the time is rather
predictable). So you will need to do some comboing with this card. One
favorite is Cytherians. Try Lack of Preparation / Cytherians and make sure
the ship will have to stop on the hole. SLURP, here goes the all-important
mission crew. Just a pity it doesn't work on an outpost (did someone say
"Outpost Raid" ?) or on a planet.

Almost as good in getting people to holes (or holes to people) is Q.
However, you will only rarely catch a big crew here as your opponent will
probably have a turn or even several turns to move away before the next big
SLURP. So while this is a good idea, we'll have to add some timing. Now of
course we can only time it if we have control over the actions ourselves. So
how can we relocate something on our turn ? Right, Blade of T'Kon. Acquire
it at the right moment and there -SLURP- goes your opponent's
whatever-is-just-not-the-thing-you-want-to-see. That is, if this whatever is
at a planet. Hmmm, I'm sure we can do better.

So let's go mad and run into a Dilemma ourselves. Namely into a Q, with the
intent of failing it. Of course not before we played a Receptacle Stones on
one of our opponent's ships. He gets to rearrange the spaceline, then you
get to re-rearrange the spaceline and then you get to a SLURP. Result:
Instant location killer. And this time with no ifs, whens or buts. Just get
rid of whatever location bugs you most, and possibly on turn 5.

Oh, there are a few more cards that help the Black Hole. Horga'hn is always
fun, especially when combined with one of the above methods to get a few of
your opponent's locations really close to the SLURP.

Then of course the Husnock Trap. For this, you'll need a Hole at the end of
the spaceline, neighboring a Space and then a 5 Span location. If your
opponent is moving his Husnock on the turn before a SLURP, just use a
Wormhole to haul it to the Hole. Now he can stay there (SLURP) or move to
the neighboring space (SLURP as well).

And against a hole ? Of course, there's always Revolving Door (regardless
how illogical this is) and you can also Supernova a Black Hole. The Nova
cancels the Hole game text and so it stays on top of the card forever. Now
here's a paradoxon ;-)

Oh, how about a game where neither player can do anything ? If a game with a
Black Hole takes long enough (say abut 52 turns), there's no spaceline left
to play on.

There's yet more fun you can have with this hilarious card, however this
requires another card I haven't reviewed yet, so I'll leave that to another
article...

But for a closing a quick Black Hole STCCG quiz: I have no Artifacts in play
and no means to score points. But at the end of my turn I will win because
of a SLURP. What is the situation ? (Hint: There is no Borg Ship involved -
SLURPing Borg does not get anyone points)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Black Hole + Q + Receptacle Stones. Biggest OUCH in the game yet.

Hi, folks,

after a rather long COTD-less time (sorry, folks, you don't want to have my
schedule ;-) ), here's some material for you again...

Before you ask: I won't join the First Contact fray in a hurry. This set is
rather complicated and I don't like to make about a thousand mistakes in ten
articles. Thus, I'll do a few more Fajo cards before jumping into the big
new thing.

How about one for the Federation today:


    @{b}GUINAN@{ub}

    Personnel, Federation, ultra-rare FJ.

    Integrity 10
    Cunning 9
    Strength 7

    CIVILIAN, Once per turn, may nullify any [AU] icon or [Q] icon
    Interrupt, Event or Dilemma where present. If on any Enterprise,
    doubles Captain's Log there. Staff Star.

@{i}"500-year-old El-Aurian. U.S.S. Enterprise bartender. Trusted advisor and
confidant of Jean-Luc Picard."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice card? Sure. This Guinan replaces two cards at once - Madam Guinan and I
Am Not A Merry Man - and means a powerful defensive addition to any
Federation deck. Worried about Brain Drain? Nullify it. Thought Fire? No
problem. Penalty Boxes and Bailiffs? Who cares. And now? Just four cards? No
way. However, the others aren't the ones you see in tournaments everyday.

Events: Wartime conditions - makes little sense as you probably had a reason
for playing it and it can't hurt. Rishon - well okay, but who ever sees a
Rishon on an Event on a location? Doppelganger? Never seen. Drought Tree -
small benefit as you don't need Guinan to be unopposed.

On the Interrupt side - Vorgon Raiders, unlikely but you'll be glad if you
can cancel it, Dead in Bed will become more important in the future, Wolf
won't usually target the right location for Guinan to work, same for Eyes in
the Dark and Devidian Foragers. And Temporal Narcosis doesn't target any
location at all and can thus not be nullified by Guinan anyway.

Leaves us with Dilemmas. Frame of Mind, Maman Picard and Parallel Romance.
All not the most common ones to see, but devastating if they hit. Better to
get rid of them. Then Empathic Echo (which can easily be a wall and thus
very annoying). Conundrum and Interphasic Plasma Creatures also tend to
stall more often than not and are thus Guinan targets. The rest - Android
Nightmares, the Royale Casino cards and Quantum Singularity Lifeforms are
highly unlikely candidates for nullification - you usually won't encounter
any detrimental effect from them in a Fed deck.

Okay, I won't even go into Q-cards, just remember you can't nullify a Gift
of the Tormentor gone wrong with Guinan...

A doubled Captain's Log on any Enterprise is also quite okay when you try to
make a First Contact inspired Enterprise space dominance deck (which should
be quite possible with the new deck sizes. Just don't forget a few Incoming
Message: Attack Authorization to get your deck rolling.)

The attributes - inferior only to Data and Soong-Type Androids in total
points, well distributed to boot. The only thing I'd have liked to see on
top of this would have been one regular skill - Anthropology would have fit
nicely...

Hi, folks,

finally, the big "4". And everyone asking what Uncle Wes is doing this
time... No way ;-) I'll use a regular card. But not just any card. The
mystery card in the Fajo Collection, the new king of ORs...


    @{b}PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY@{ub}

    Artifact, ultra-rare FJ

Place in hand until played at any time on Horga'hn OR Thought Maker OR Mona
Lisa OR Static Warp Bubble OR Kivas Fajo - Collector OR The Traveler:
Transcendence OR "Devidian Door" OR Supernova OR Black Hole OR Anti-Time
Anomaly. Reverses that card. (Not duplicatable)

@{i}"Surreal 1931 Salvador Dali painting stolen by Kivas Fajo."@{ui}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow. Nine ORs. Lots of fun. And some of these actually don't even require
your opponent to help you but can just be done alone.

Let's try the big walkthrough:

(1) Horga'hn. Much more rude than just a Devil or Jamaharon, use that
Horga'hn your opponent just took so much pain to acquire for yourself. Be
sure to thank him for the help. You can also try to acquire the Persistence
early (Q's Planet) and watch your opponent squirm in fear of acquiring his
own (preferably vital ;-) ) Artifact. If you have a really cooperative
opponent (Hi Quilitz !) he might decline to solve a mission that would make
him win the game just because he thinks you could... Talk psyched out ;-)

(2) Thought Maker. This is also rude. An opponent who thinks he can just
serve you the ultimate Rakal Shuffle (as if this were necessary with the
average player - they get their best cards to the bottom of the deck anyway)
will wind up doing the exact opposite. The problem here - Thought Maker plays
as an Interrupt, so you need the Persistence early, which will usually
discourage your opponent from playing the Thought Maker.

(3) Mona Lisa. This is a fun one. Of course you can use it on the Mona Lisa
that wimp of an opponent on the other side is stocking, but why not use your
own Mona Lisa? Put it on a shuttle steered by Korris, Konmel and Kova Tholl.
Then reverse it with Persistence and bag a whopping 45. Much easier than a
Borg Ship ;-) Just don't forget you need some excuse to attack yourself.
Incoming Message: Attack Authorization should do well...

(4) Static Warp Bubble. Now who is the one discarding cards? Might force
your opponent to waste an Ux on his own card (or use Mercy Kill)

(5) Kivas Fajo - Collector. More of a threat than an actual damage dealer, a
Persistence in hand might discourage your opponent from playing that Kivas
he holds, knowing pretty well you'll get the cards and then the next Kivas
has just that much more of a chance to get Uxed...

(6) The Traveler: Transcendence. Another one of those that will send your
opponent for the Uxes to kill his own Events, but in this particular
situation you can be even more rude. Play a Traveler / Thought Fire / Brain
Drain deck. Acquire a Persistence and then play a Traveler on your opponent
(which you of course immediately reverse) Net result: You get the cards, he
gets the trouble from Thought Fire. Keep a few Regenerates to ensure a
steady flow of Brain Drains and don't forget the Disruptor Overload to take
care of the occasional IP Scanner.

(7) Devidian Door. Ouch, an Artifact AND a D-Door just to get a personnel
back to your hand? And yet, this might have its uses. I remember one game
where my key personnel (R'Mor) got Cardie-trapped. I had a second R'Mor in
hand, but I could not play him. Same goes for uniques that get
Frame-of-Minded, Penalty-Boxed, etc. Grab them back, replay them, have fun
again.

(8) Supernova. Now this is what I call an easy mission attempt. With
everything destroyed by the Nova (including any unwanted seeds), the mission
is a piece of cake for your power crew. Move over, revert the Nova, score.
Also works well to turn a three-mission deck into something that plays like
a two-mission deck. (One mission gets Tox, one gets Persistence, then BOOM
and revert, killing all Dilemmas.)

(9) Black Hole. Another fun one, especially if you can get the Artifact
before playing the Hole. Just when your opponent thought that stretch of
empty space between his missions were span 6, it suddenly becomes 12, then
17, 22, 27, oops ;-)

(10) Anti-Time Anomaly. All Hallow's Eve for the STCCG player. Teach your
holo-deck opponent a lesson. You don't really care about the two times you
lose six crew while he loses nothing. Wait until the third Anomaly gets
reversed and suddenly your entire deck (including the guys that had
unfortunate encounters with Dilemmas) plays against his skill-challenged
Holo crew. He will of course need another four turns to get another Anomaly
to blow, way enough for you to complete a mission or five.

I love this card - it is versatile, complex, full of hidden strategic
rudeness, encourages a few mind games and even makes the occasional Motty
(aka use****) card useful.
