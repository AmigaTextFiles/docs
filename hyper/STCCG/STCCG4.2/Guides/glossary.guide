@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}@{u}Overview@{ub}@{uu}

This document is comprehensive; it contains all Star Trek Customizable
Card Game rules and rulings as of October 1999. We recommend that you
discard all rules documents (booklets, supplements, FAQs and Current
Rulings) dated prior to October 1999 and refer to this Glossary (and the
companion Rulebook) for all rules questions. Periodic updates to the
Rulebook and Glossary will be published in a separate Current Rulings
document.

Answers given by official Decipher representatives are not official
until included in this Glossary or in a Current Rulings document. Such
answers are highly recommended for use by tournament directors, but the
TD always has the final authority on rulings.

How to use the Glossary - You do not need to read this document from
cover to cover. Instead, use it as you would a dictionary, to learn as
you go.For example, if you have a gameplay question about a card, look
up the card title first; if you don't find your answer there, look up
the concept or gameplay term you are questioning (battle, capturing,
card play, affiliation, skills, downloading, probing etc.). In many
cases, we have included cross-references in boldface type to help you
find your way.

Entries are arranged alphabetically, ignoring apostrophes and quotation
marks and treating hyphens, dashes and colons as spaces (e.g., the entry
for Q-Flash is sorted as "Q Flash" and appears before Qapla'!, while
K'chiQ is sorted as "KchiQ" and appears after Kahless). Entries for
specific cards are sorted according to exact card title (e.g., the entry
for The Emissary is in the T's, not the E's). Borg drones are listed by
their designations (e.g., Interlink Drone, not Nine of Eleven), except
for Seven of Nine.

Some Glossary entries provide revised game text for cards. In most
cases, these revisions merely make the proper gameplay of a card more
clear, or implement a rule or ruling directly on the card itself. These
revisions are marked "Clarification." In other cases, the game text
revisions represent gameplay changes relative to earlier versions of the
cards, in order to correct a wording error, address a gameplay concern
or correct some other problem. These revisions are marked Errata. A
complete list of revised cards is included under revised game text.

A few cards have been reprinted (in the 1995 "beta" printing of the
Premiere set, or preview cards in their black-border printing) to use
the revised wordings. Other cards will use the newer wordings in any
future printings. In either case, the game text provided here defines
the correct gameplay for all versions of the clarified cards as of
September 1999.

Text in square or angle brackets represents an icon. Most icon

@Node ABANDONSHIP "STCCG.guide/Glossary/Abandon Ship!"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}Abandon Ship!@{ub}

For this dilemma, a ship's RANGE is considered reduced
if it is affected by a card that says that its RANGE is
reduced (Baryon Buildup), is -X (Vole Infestation) or
is "@{"disabled" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DISABLED"}" ("Pup"). A ship "cannot move" (Menthar
Booby Trap) is not considered to have its RANGE reduced.
The presence of a RANGE enhancement card does not negate
a RANGE reduction for this dilemma. For example, a ship
with its RANGE -2 from a Baryon Buildup and +2 from a 
Plasmadyne Relay still has its RANGE reduced. A ship is
damaged if it has any @{"damage" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DAMAGE"} markers on ot, or if it has
received "rotation damage".

You may choose which of your personnel will fullfill the
staffing requirements of your ship. A {command} personnel
may be choosen to cover a {staff} requirement. A ship
with "no staffing requirements" requires any one
appropriate personnel to staff it (see @{"ship staffing" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/SHIPSTAFF"}). The
number of personnel required to staff the ship is a "group
limit" subject to the group limit modification rules. See
@{"dual-personnel cards" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DUALPERS"}.

Rescuing or @{"capturing" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/CAPTURE"} the abandoned personnel is a game action.
You may not rescue your abandoned personnel during your
mission attempt. The personnel cannot be rescued by a 
docked ship. You may not capture your opponent's abandoned
personnel during his turn.

@Node ABDUCTION "STCCG.guide/Glossary/abduction"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}abduction@{ub}

Cards such as Assimilate Counterpart and the Talon Drone
(Three of Nineteen) allow your Borg to abduct a personnel during
personal combat. When this happens, both combatants cease to
participate in the battle and may immediately beam away (if
possible), but are still "stopped".

The abducted personnel is consisted to be escorted by your Borg
present. On later turns you may move it around (like equipment). If
the abducted personnel is ever unescorted, your opponent can rescue
them with his own personnel present.

Abducted personnel are @{"disabled" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DISABLED"}, and do not participate in battles.
They are not considered captives and thus may not be rescued by the
Rescue Captives card. An abducted personnel who becomes
assimilated is no longer considered abducted.

@Node ACTION "STCCG.guide/Glossary/actions"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}actions@{ub}

An action is one operation that you perfom in the game.
Example of actions include playing, drawing or discarding one card,
moving a ship from one location to another (possibly passing other
locations on the way), moving personnel by beaming or other means,
using a personnel's special skill (except "continous" skills like
Shakaar Edon's STRENGTH enhancement), battle (from initiation until
a winner has been determined and damage or deaths have been
resolved) and attempting a mission.

Applying automatic modifiers (e.g. "your personnel are STRENGTH
+2 where present") and checking conditions (e.g. battle affiliation
restrictions) are not actions.

Group actions - An action may cause other actions to occur within
itself. For example, a personnel battle includes sub-actions of creating
a combat pile, individual personal combat engagements, determining
the winner of the battle and discarding killed cards. An action in place
of your normal card play, in place of a card draw etc. may also consist
of several sub-actions (such as playing multiple cards under Red
Alert!). This is called a "group action" and until it has finished,
neither player may initiate any other actions except actions that
suspend play, or responses to the group action or a sub-action.

Valid responses may be made to each sub-action of a group action.
For example, when a ship is reporting with crew, a player may choose
to play an Energy Vortex on the ship, or on a specific personnel being
reported. Likewise, you may play Android Headlock or use
Hypospray's text in response to a specific combat pairing.

Interrupting actions - You may bot interrupt an action by another
action, unless the second action:

- is a valid response to the first action or one of its sub-actions; or

- explicitly "suspends play" (according to a card text or rule).

Exception: Mission attempts - Attempting (or scouting) a mission is
one action that may not be interrupted, except that Interrupt and
Doorway cards may be played between seed card encounters and
after the mission attempt is announced but before the first seed card
is encountered (but not between the last seed card encounter and the
end of the mission attempt). No other actions may be performed
between seed card encounters. You may make valid responses to the
encounter of specific dilemmas during the mission attempt.

Sequence of steps - Every action has three steps that must occur in
order:

1. @{"Initiation" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ACINIT"} (declaring the use of a multi-function card, meeting
   conditions, choosing targets and playing costs).

2. @{"Optional responses" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ACRESPONSE"} (attempts to cancel or modify the action).

3. @{"Results" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ACRESULT"} (gameplay consequences of the action).

These three steps are described in more detail in the following sections.

@Endnode

@Node ACINIT "STCCG.guide/Glossary/actions - step 1: initiation"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}actions - step 1: initiation@{ub}

Initiating an action includes any or all
of the following, in this order:

* declaring the use of a multi-function card (e.g., you may use Going to
  the Top to return a personnel to hand OR to download a personnel; you
  may discard a Space-Time Portal from the table for one of five possible
  results);

* meeting conditions of rules and game text (e.g., battle affiliation
  restrictions; an open Alternate Universe Door or Space-Time Portal; game
  text such as "plays at start of battle");

* choosing targets (e.g., selecting a player to draw cards with Kivas
  Fajo - Collector; selecting an outpost at which to report a personnel;
  choosing a ship to attack; choosing a drone to download from your draw
  deck with the Borg Queen's skill); and

* paying costs required by rules or game text (e.g., using your normal
  card play to report a personnel card; forfeiting a card draw to initiate
  a download; using a special download icon).

@Endnode

@Node ACRESPONSE "STCCG.guide/Glossary/actions - step 2: optional responses"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}actions - step 2: optional responses@{ub}

After an action has been initiated and before it has begun its result,
responses are allowed. For a response to be valid, it must specifically
relate to (modify, cancel, nullify or prevent) the action.

For example, if you initiate a personnel battle at a site, a valid
response would be any action that says it "plays at start of battle,"
occurs "during battle," "cancels (or prevents) a personnel battle,"
plays when an adversary is "just engaged" etc. Smoke Bomb and Phaser
Burns are valid responses to personnel battle. An example of a card that
is not a valid response to personnel battle is Going to the Top;
although returning a personnel to hand or downloading one could affect
the outcome of the battle, Going to the Top does not specifically
indicate that it is related to battle.

Similarly, Hugh is a valid response to the attack of a Borg Ship dilemma
just encountered, because it nullifies that attack. Playing Temporal
Rift on the ship and returning the ship to your hand by discarding a
Space-Time Portal are not valid responses to encountering a Borg Ship
(or any other dilemma).

A card play or other action that may occur "at any time" (e.g., playing
an Interrupt card, revealing a hidden agenda) is not a valid response to
an action unless it specifically relates to that action. For example, a
card may not be played via "Devidian Door" to an Away Team during a
mission attempt or battle.

However, a card which says it "suspends play" may be played at any time
(during the response step or results step of an action), and may
temporarily suspend any action, whether related or not. Using a special
download icon also suspends play. (Revealing a hidden agenda does not
suspend play.) Thus, a personnel's special download icon may be used to
download a card during a mission attempt or battle, and Launch Portal
may be used to download and launch a shuttle during battle.

More than one valid response may be made to an action. For example, if I
play Palor Toff, you may respond first with Countermanda to place three
cards out of play, and then with Amanda Rogers to nullify Palor Toff.

Interrupts and skills that "prevent" an action may be used as a response
to that action. If the action thus prevented is a card play, it
nullifies that card play. For example, Howard Heirloom Candle "prevents
Anya or Salia from morphing this turn." If I play You Dirty Rat on Anya
to morph her into a rat, you may respond with Howard Heirloom Candle to
nullify You Dirty Rat. (See @{"battle" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/BATTLE"}.)

When all responses are over, or if neither player chooses to respond,
the action has its result.

If a properly initiated card play is nullified, any costs paid are not
recovered. However, all results of the card play are canceled. For
example, you play Q's Tent and I nullify it with Wrong Door. You cannot
play another Q's Tent this turn (a cost of playing the card), but you do
not lose the ability to draw cards this turn (part of the results of the
Q's Tent).

Responses modifying targets or conditions - If a hidden agenda is
activated as a response to an action, all of its effects are retroactive
to the start of the initiation of the action, as if the hidden agenda
had already been revealed before the action was initiated. Thus, if the
hidden agenda invalidates a condition for an action, the action becomes
illegal. If the action was a card play, the card returns to your hand.
For example, you initiate the play of Activate Subcommands, and I
respond by revealing Computer Crash. Since Activate Subcommands requires
a download, it is illegal with Computer Crash in play, and it returns to
your hand.

If a condition for an action becomes invalid before the action resolves,
for any reason other than the activation of a hidden agenda (e.g.,
through the play of another card in a Manheim effect "hiccup"), it has
no effect on the initiation. For example, if you initiate the play of
K'chiQ, and I close your Alternate Universe Door with a Revolving Door
during a "hiccup," you can still play K'chiQ because the condition was
met during the initiation and is not re-checked.

If a target of an action becomes invalid after the action is initiated,
then the action is "played out" without results. If the action is a card
play, that card is discarded. For example, if you target an outpost to
play K'chiQ, and I then destroy the outpost with a Supernova during a
Manheim "hiccup," you must discard K'chiQ.

@Endnode

@Node ACRESULT "STCCG.guide/Glossary/actions - step 3: results"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}actions - step 3: results@{ub}

When an action begins to have its results,
this typically will cause one or more other actions to occur. For
example, the result of Kivas Fajo - Collector is that the target player
must draw three cards. Each of the three card draws is an action with
its own three steps, and thus each may be responded to (e.g., with
Subspace Schism). However, no more responses to the original action
(Kivas Fajo - Collector) are allowed between those actions, because
Kivas Fajo - Collector's optional responses step is past and it is
currently having its result.

@Endnode

@Node ACTURN "STCCG.guide/Glossary/actions - taking turns"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}actions - taking turns@{ub}

Players alternate turns initiating actions. You may initiate the first
action of your turn. When your action has had its result or is cancelled,
then your opponent may initiate the next action, and so on.

When an action you initiated is in its optional responses step, your
opponent has the first opportunity to initiate a response, then (when
that response is complete) you may initiate a response, and so on.

Whenever it is your turn to initiate an action, if you do not wish to do
so you may "pass." Whenever both players pass consecutively during the
optional responses step of an action, that action proceeds to its
result.

You must allow your opponent ample time to initiate an action or "pass."
If both players want to perform an action at the same time, the player
whose turn it is may perform his first and players then alternate
actions as usual.

You cannot initiate any action on your opponent's turn except:
        * you may make valid responses;
        * you may play interrupts (between other actions or as valid
          responses); and
        * you may play a card or use game text that specifies it may be used
          "at any time" or "every turn," that "suspends play," or that in
          some other way indicates that the action may be taken on the
          opponent's turn.

Using your personnel's skills is an action (except applying automatic
modifiers such as "Attributes all +5 if with Toral" or "Suspends effect
of Doppelganger where present"). Thus, during your opponent's turn, you
may use skills that represent valid responses (e.g., "May replace anyone
randomly selected to die here," "Nullifies one just-played Rogue Borg
where present") or that specifically allow use during the opponent's
turn (e.g., special downloads, "May download from hand (suspending
play)," "Once every turn, may "pounce"..."). Examples of skills that may
not be used during your opponent's turn include "Once each turn, may
reprogram any androids present" and "May 'steal' unattended Equipment
cards present."

@Endnode

@Node ACJUST "STCCG.guide/Glossary/actions - "just""
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}actions - "just"@{ub}

Some actions may be initiated only just after some
other action or condition has occurred, before anything else can
intervene. These are typically indicated by the word "just" in game
text. It may be a response to another action (e.g., "just initiated,"
"just played"), or it may be a new action that follows the result of the
other action (e.g., "just completed"). An action may be responded to or
followed by any number of applicable "just" actions.

"Just" actions always take place before non-"just" actions. This may
allow or require you to initiate an action when it would otherwise be
your opponent's turn to do so. For example, you initiate a planet
mission attempt and solve the mission. Although it is normally your
opponent's turn to initiate the next action, you may first play Particle
Fountain ("play...on just completed planet mission").

@Endnode

@Node ACREQ "STCCG.guide/Glossary/actions - required"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}actions - required@{ub}

Required actions are usually indicated by "must" or
"must do nothing but." There are two types of required actions, moving
and non-moving.

Moving required actions include:
* Cytherians (you must travel to the end of the spaceline)
* Incoming Messages (Federation, etc.) (you must return to an outpost)
* Rhetorical Question (you must return to a facility)
* Conundrum (you must target and "chase" a ship).
* Issue Secret Orders (you must move to the targeted mission)

A ship targeted by a moving required action may stop at intermediate
locations along its route, as long as it uses its full available RANGE
each turn. Personnel and equipment may be brought aboard the ship at any
point in the journey, whether required for staffing or not, by beaming
(using the transporters of either the affected ship or another ship or
facility), reporting (using the game text of the ship itself, such as
Borg Cube, or another card, such as The Emissary's skill) or any other
method that does not involve the ship and crew taking an action such as
docking. Personnel and equipment may not be removed from the ship by any
means.

The only other action the ship and crew may perform is moving. (If a
card says "ship must do nothing but...", it should be taken to mean
"ship and crew must do nothing but...") It may not cloak or initiate
battle, including a counter-attack (though it may return fire if
attacked). The crew may not initiate battle against an intruder aboard
the ship, though they may defend themselves if attacked.

When a moving required action states that a ship must travel somewhere
at "normal speed" or "full speed," it means you must use all of its
available RANGE each turn (assuming that the ship is staffed to move),
including any automatic modifiers such as a Plasmadyne Relay aboard,
even if this will place the ship at a hazard such as Gaps in Normal
Space. You may stop at intermediate locations.

You may use Lakanta's or The Traveler's skills, Where No One Has Gone
Before, Wormholes, Transwarp Network Gateways or other such means to
shorten the travel. You are not required to do so.

If the ship is targeted by another moving required action, it must
resolve that action after it has completed its first moving required
action.

The ship can be affected by cards played on it or encountered on the
spaceline, such as Wormholes, Gaps In Normal Space, etc.

Non-moving required actions include:
* Samaritan Snare (you must attempt the mission, if Federation)
* Incoming Message - Attack Authorization (you must attack a ship)
* Conundrum after you reach the targeted ship (you must attack the ship)
* Issue Secret Orders after you reach the mission (you must attempt the
  mission)

If a ship is targeted by a non-moving required action, you must perform
that action as soon as is possible, typically as your next action. Cards
that affect that action (battle-related cards in the case of Conundrum,
Senior Staff Meeting in the case of Samaritan Snare) may still be
played.

@Node ACTRACBEAM "STCCG.guide/Glossary/Activate Tractor Beam"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}Activate Tractor Beam@{ub}

The first function of this interrupt allows you
to tow one ship for the extent of your available RANGE on the current
turn, and is then discarded. When played for the second function, the
interrupt remains on the ship to add the Tractor Beam permanently. You
may play two copies of this interrupt on a ship, one to add a Tractor
Beam and one to tow a ship.

Because a @{"cloaked ship" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/CLOAKSHIP"} may not use a tractor beam, neither the towing
ship nor the ship under tow may cloak.

(has no normal "play" function). See @{"outside the game" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/OUTSIDEGAME"}.

Any non-Borg personnel or ships obtained from an expansion pack with
this incident are considered assimilated before you report them for duty
(thus rendering [AU] icons, for example, irrelevant). Their native
quadrant does not change. If played immediately, such cards may be
reported anywhere (e.g., ships to any spaceline location or your Borg
Outpost; personnel to any of your ships or outposts or to a planet). If
you place them in your hand to play later, you must obey all reporting
restrictions, including @{"native quadrant" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/NATIVE"} restrictions.

  @{b}affiliation and species@{ub}

Cards that affect "Klingons", "Romulans", etc.
apply to personnel of that affiliation as well as that @{"species" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/SPECIES"}
(including hybrids). Thus, Worf, K'Ehleyr, and Quark Son of Keldar (in
Klingon mode) all count as Klingons for Klingon Death Yell. Ba'el and
Simon Tarses count as Romulans for D'Tan's INTEGRITY enhancement (with
appropriate treaty). Miles O'Brien will not work with Garak (in either
mode), Dukat or Evek.

Espionage cards are an exception. Normally you must have a personnel of
@{"matching affiliation" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/MATCHAFF"} in the Away Team to attempt a mission, and
Espionage cards simply allow you to use a different affiliation. Species
is not relevant to mission attempts.

An outpost may be built by a @{"compatible" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/COMPATIBLE"} ENGINEER of the designated
species or affiliation, if applicable. For example, a Ferengi Trading
Post may be built by Dr. Reyga, who is Non-Aligned but Ferengi by
species.

Cards that refer to an affiliation by its icon (such as Kira Nerys)
refer only to that affiliation, not to species.

Although this dilemma has conditions, the Away Team is

opponent's Away Team, the ship or facility they beamed or exited from
and any of his personnel remaining on that ship or facility are now
under your temporary control, unstopped. See @{"control - temporary" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/CONTEMP"}. You
may make legal moves with the ship and crew until they are "stopped" or
until you cannot (or choose not to) take any further actions with them.
Then control returns to your opponent.

If your opponent's Borg scout fails to overcome this dilemma, you may
beam the scout back to the ship, and move the ship along the spaceline.
You must follow all Borg Away Team restrictions (i.e., you may not beam
Borg off the ship, except when allowed by your current objective, if
any, or by another card such as Emergency Transporter Armbands).

If you are not playing Borg, you may not use the Borg to attempt a
mission, because Borg don't attempt missions; or to scout - not even the
mission where the Parasites were encountered - because you have no
current objective to allow it. You may not initiate battle. If you are
also playing Borg, you may use the controlled Borg to scout for your own
current objective.

If you are playing Borg and control a non-Borg ship and crew, you may
use them exactly like any non-Borg ship and crew controlled by Alien
Parasites - they may attempt missions, beam personnel off, etc. They may
not mix with your Borg personnel. If they complete a mission, neither
player may score the mission points.

In all cases, when you are done controlling the ship, the dilemma is
replaced under the mission to be encountered on the next mission or
scouting attempt. The Borg may nullify the dilemma on a second encounter
with Adapt: Negate Obstruction.

  @{b}Artifact@{ub}

A card type representing a rare object with special powers. Artifact
cards are hidden under planet missions and are earned when the mission
is completed. (Borg may acquire artifacts at planets they assimilate
with the Survey Drone.)

Artifacts cannot be used until they have been earned (typically by
completing the mission) or acquired (e.g., according to The Charybdis or
a Survey Drone). If an artifact is discarded, nullified, destroyed or
returned to your hand, it cannot be brought back into play unless it is
first re-seeded (e.g., with Q's Planet) and earned or acquired again, or
unless a card (e.g., Secret Compartment, Reclamation or HQ: Return Orb
to Bajor) allows an artifact to be used without being earned.

The Borg must complete an objective targeting a location before the
Survey Drone can acquire any artifacts seeded at that location.

When you acquire multiple artifacts or cards seeded like artifacts, you
may generally resolve them (use immediate text, place in hand etc.) in
any order you choose. For example, if you acquire your opponent's Magic
Carpet Ride OCD and your own Varon-T Disruptor, you may choose to have
the Varon-T Disruptor join your Away Team before your opponent may
relocate your ship and Away Team.

However, if two copies of a non-duplicatable card (seeded by different
players) are earned, the first one encountered (the bottom-most card in
the seed stack) is acquired and the second copy is discarded. For
example, if both you and your opponent seed a copy of Ressikan Flute
under a mission, you acquire only the first copy encountered and discard
the second. (This also applies if you acquire another instance of a
persona which you already have in play, or a Borg counterpart when you
already have a counterpart in your collective.)

This objective has errata (the deletion of "Captain's Order."):
Seeds or plays on table. You may download to one of your outposts up
to two different mission specialists that you do not already have in
play. Also, while in play, each of your mission specialists scores 5
bonus points whenever they use their skill to meet a mission requirement.
You may voluntarily discard objective at start of any of your turns. (Unique.)

This objective has two effects. First, it allows a one-time download of
two mission specialists to an outpost (not to any other type of
facility). If you choose to use the optional download, you must do so
immediately upon seeding or playing the objective. (In order to download
during the seed phase, you must already have seeded an outpost. The
mission specialists are not seed cards, however, but come from your draw
deck or Q's Tent.) Because the card is "Unique," if you wish to play
another Assign Mission Specialists later to download two more
specialists, you must first discard the one in play at the start of your
turn. (See @{"unique and universal" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/UNIQUEANDUNIVERSAL"}.) If the download of the mission
specialists is prevented by the activation of @{"Computer Crash" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/COMPCRASH"}, this
objective remains in play on the table for its second function. The
download opportunity is permanently lost; it cannot be "saved" for later
use.

Second, while you have any Assign Mission Specialists card in play, any
mission specialists you have in play (regardless of whether downloaded
or played normally) score 5 points when using their skill to complete a
mission. The extra points are not limited to the specialists downloaded
with the AMS card currently in play.

You decide which of your personnel present use their skills in meeting
mission requirements. A mission specialist's skill may be used even if
another personnel present also possesses that skill, and a personnel
with a skill at the x2 level or higher is not required to use all of his
levels of that skill. However, two mission specialists with the same
skill may not both score 5 points when satisfying the same skill
requirement (unless the mission requires that skill at x2 level or
higher, thus allowing both of them to "use their skill").

For example, the mission Reported Activity requires
Navigation + Honor x2.
It is solved by the following Away Team:

B'iJik (Navigation, mission specialist)
Konmel (Navigation, mission specialist)
Kahless (Honor x2, mission specialist)
Batrell (Honor, mission specialist)
Governor Worf (Honor x2 plus other skills, not a mission specialist)

A maximum of 15 extra points may be scored (5 by Kahless, 5 by Batrell,
and 5 by either B'iJik or Konmel, but not both). Kahless is not forced
to meet the entire Honor x2 by himself, nor is Governor Worf required to
use his Honor at all.

  @{b}assimilation@{ub}

You may assimilate planets or your opponent's personnel
and ships by using Objective and other cards that allow assimilation.
Cards that allow you to assimilate personnel include the Talon Drone,
Assimilation Tubules, Assimilate Counterpart and Borg Servo. (Your Borg
may not assimilate personnel you have captured unless a card or rule
allows you to do so.) Assimilate Planet and Assimilate Homeworld allow
you to assimilate planets (along with any facilities that may be located
there). Assimilate Starship allows you to assimilate ships.

When personnel, ships or planets are assimilated, they come under your
control and undergo specific transformations.

Personnel assimilation - When your Borg assimilate an opposing
personnel, it becomes a Borg drone under your control and it undergoes
the following transformations:

* Its affiliation changes to [Borg].
* Its name is irrelevant to the Borg (e.g., if you assimilated Wesley
  Crusher, he would not overcome the Zaldan dilemma). However, your
  opponent must still obey the @{"persona" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/PERSONA"} rule (e.g., he may not report
  another copy of Wesley, or another version of his persona).
* Its classification becomes a regular skill (the first-listed skill).
* Its staffing ability changes to a subcommand icon, and, accordingly,
  its attributes adapt to service the Collective as follows:

Old Staffing            New Icon        INTEGRITY  CUNNING  STRENGTH
[Cmd]                   [Com/Blue]              7        5         5
[Stf]                   [Nav/Green]             5        7         5
Neither icon            [Def/Red]               5        5         7

* Its @{"gender" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/GENDER"}, @{"species" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/SPECIES"}, @{"lore" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/LORE"}, @{"restriction box" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/RESTRBOX"} and any miscellaneous icons
  are immediately rendered irrelevant.

Borg do not assimilate (or target for assimilation) ANIMALs or
holographic re-creations. Such personnel are excluded from any
selections for abduction or assimilation.  All other personnel may be
assimilated normally, including androids and changelings.

In addition to drone assimilation, you may assimilate a male personnel
as a counterpart by completing the Assimilate Counterpart objective.
When this occurs, the counterpart undergoes the same transformations as
a drone, with the following exceptions:

* He retains his gender, species and other lore information for
  Borg-related cards only. For example, an android counterpart will not
  trigger a dilemma that says, "If android present..."; a Klingon-species
  counterpart cannot enable the use of "Klingon use only" equipment; a
  counterpart is not affected by Male's Love Interest.
* His staffing ability adapts to service the Collective by changing to
  all three subcommand icons ([Com][Nav][Def]). His INTEGRITY and CUNNING
  remain the same, and his STRENGTH is +3.
* His previous affiliation remains relevant for your Assimilate
  Homeworld objective. If he is multi-affiliation, all of his affiliation
  icons may be used for this purpose.

Your Collective is limited to one counterpart (or personnel targeted as
such) at a time. While any personnel is targeted to become a
counterpart, that personnel may not be assimilated as a drone and is
therefore excluded from all such selections. Dual-personnel cards may
not be targeted for assimilation as a counterpart. A counterpart may be
converted to a drone with XXXHeWillMakeanExcellentDroneX.

Your Borg may assimilate your opponent's Borg personnel. The normal
rules for conversion of icons and adjustment of attributes do not apply
if the assimilated personnel or ship is already Borg.

* A Borg retains its subcommand icon and attributes when assimilated by
  the opponent's Borg, and simply becomes a member of a different
  collective.
* If the Borg Queen or a pre-assimilated counterpart, such as Locutus of
  Borg, is assimilated as a drone, it retains all three subcommand icons
  and the same attributes. Its gender, species, and lore become
  irrelevant.
* If you assimilate your opponent's pre-assimilated @{"counterpart" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/COUNTERPART"} as a
  counterpart (with the Assimilate Counterpart objective), he retains all
  his subcommand icons and the same attributes, and simply becomes a
  member of your collective. You will score points from the objective for
  his skill dot icons.

Ship assimilation - When your Borg assimilate an opposing ship, you take
control of that ship and it undergoes the following transformations:

* Its affiliation changes to [Borg].
* Its name is irrelevant to the Borg, but your opponent must obey the
  persona rule.
* Non-Borg staffing requirements adapt to service the Collective:

        Old Requirement New Requirement
        [Cmd]                           [Com]
        [Stf]                           [Nav]
        Other icon                      [Def]
        Other requirements              irrelevant
* Its lore and any other icons are irrelevant.
* If your Borg assimilate your opponent's Borg ship, it retains all its
  staffing icons but is now under your control.

Any shuttlecraft and other @{"carried ships" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/CARRIEDSHIPS"} aboard are assimilated (but
opposing personnel and equipment aboard are not).

Planet assimilation - When you assimilate a planet, it changes to [Borg]
affiliation for purposes of building outposts there.

* Any seeded artifacts are place face up on the planet and may be later
  acquired by the Survey Drove, Sixteen of Nineteen, or by any non-Borg
  personnel present.
* Any opposing personnel, equipment and landed ships on that planet are
  assimilated. Any opposing facilities at that location, all personnel and
  equipment in or aboard a facility and all ships docked at a facility are
  also assimilated. Personnel aboard a docked ship are not assimilated. As
  part of the interim outpost rules, you may not report Borg cards for
  duty at an assimilated facility.

Other cards in play at that location are unaffected by the planet's
assimilation.

Facility assimilation - There is currently no way to assimilate a
facility except as a side effect of assimilating a planet (all
facilities at the location are assimilated). Once assimilated, a
facility's SHIELDS no longer prevent beaming (as with Borg ships).

  @{b}Attribute Modifiers@{ub}

If more than one card modifies the @{"attributes" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ATTRIBUTES"} of a ship or personnel,
add or subtract first, then multiply. For example, if you have a both
a Plasmadyne Relay (RANGE and SHIELDS +2) and a Kurlan Naiskos (all
attributes x3) on the U.S.S. Enterprise (9-8-9), which also has
Strafing Run on it as a damage marker (all attributes -1), you would
have:

RANGE and SHIELDS: (9 + 2 - 1) x 3 = 30; WEAPONS: (8 - 1) x 3 = 21.

However, if a card or rule changes an attribute to a specific value,
instead of adding or subtracting, that change is handled first and is
treated as if it were printed on the card. For example, if Data, with
normal attributes of 8-12-12, is affected by Frame of Mind, which sets
his attributes to 3-3-3, and his STRENGTH is then enhanced +2 by a
disruptor, it will be 5. "Rotation" damage to a ship, which reduces its
RANGE to 5, is an example of a rule that "sets" a value rather than
modifying it. (See @{"damage" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DAMAGE"}.)

Personnel or ship attributes may not be reduced to less than 0. If a
ship has a normal RANGE of 1 and Baryon Buildup is played on it (reduces
RANGE by 2), its RANGE becomes 0. Reducing a ship's RANGE or personnel's
STRENGTH to 0 does not destroy the ship (unless the reducing card says
so) or kill the personnel.

  @{b}Away Team and Crew@{ub}

When your personnel are aboard a ship or space facility that you control,
they are a crew. In all other situations, they are an Away Team. When
aboard a ship or facility controlled by your opponent, they are also
intruders.

By default, all your compatible personnel on a planet (outside a
facility or landed ship), or on the same ship or facility (same site if
a Nor) are a single Away Team or crew, excluding personnel who are
"stopped," disabled, in stasis or under house arrest (they form a
separate group).

On your turn, you may declare your personnel on a planet to be split
into separate Away Teams. You cannot voluntarily split up your personnel
on a ship, facility or site, but a dilemma may temporarily "stop" a
portion of a crew, forming a separate crew. All such separate compatible
Away Teams or crews automatically become one Away Team or crew at the
end of your turn, and thus may be attacked by your opponent as a single
group.

If personnel from two separate ships beam down to form one Away Team and
they encounter a dilemma that affects the ship, it would affect all
ships they beamed from.

Cards referring to an Away Team normally do not include crew. For
example, the Genetronic Replicator can prevent deaths only in your Away
Team, not in a crew. However, some [S/P] dilemmas, such as Thought Fire,
Frame of Mind, and Chinese Finger Puzzle, incorrectly refer either to a
ship's crew or to an Away Team. Treat such cards as if they said "crew
or Away Team."

An Away Team remains associated with the ship it beamed (or disembarked)
from until they board another of your ships or space facilities,or until
they are separated by the departure of the ship or the Away Team from
that location (including the ship time-traveling into the future via
Temporal Rift). For example, if you play Memory Wipe on your ship, beam
an Away Team to a planet and move the ship to another location, those
personnel revert to their normal affiliations. Also, Magic Carpet Ride
OCD will relocate only the Away Team(s) at the ship's location; a
personnel sent away by a Love Interest is no longer associated with that
ship.

When you move this ship from a location in a region to another location
in the same region, without "flying past" any location that is not part
of the region (e.g., an inserted [univ] Space), your maximum available
RANGE is 9 (less any RANGE already used that turn). At all other times
(including when the ship is not moving), your maximum RANGE is 5, less
the RANGE used that turn.

Thus, when moving from Kressari Rendezvous (Cardassia Region, span 2) to
Establish Station (no region, span 5), your RANGE is 5 and will be
exhausted by the move. When moving in the other direction, your RANGE is
also 5, and at the end of the move your remaining RANGE is 3. If you
then make a separate move from Kressari Rendezvous to the adjacent Orb
Negotiations (Cardassia Region, span 4), your RANGE at the start if the
move will be 7 (9 - 2 used), and at the end your remaining RANGE will be
3 (for further moving within the region).

If another card allows this ship to land or take off, it does not use up
the one landing or takeoff per turn allowed by the ship's own game text.
For example, it may dock (land) or undock (take off) at Docking Pads and
still land on a planet the same turn. If Establish Landing Protocols is
in play, the ship may land or take off once per turn using its own text,
and land or take off once more per turn using the event's text (and
using 1 RANGE).

@Node BATTLE "STCCG.guide/Glossary/Battle"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}Battle@{ub}

The basic rules for both personnel and ship battle are covered in the
Rulebook under Executing Orders.

Affiliation attack restrictions - When attacking a force composed of
more than one affiliation, you must obey all relevant affiliation attack
restrictions. However, if a card specifically allows you to attack a
particular affiliation, then you may attack any forces that include that
affiliation, even if other cards are working with them. For example,
Admiral Leyton allows you to attack a joint
Dominion/Cardassian/Non-Aligned force.

Attacking a ship with your personnel aboard - While you may not attack
your own cards, the presence of your personnel aboard an opponent's ship
or facility does not prevent you from attacking that ship or facility.
For example, if you are required by Saltah'na Clock to attack an
opposing ship, you must do so even if you have personnel (intruders)
aboard the ship.

Cancelled battle - If a properly initiated battle (or "attack") is
cancelled, "prevented" or nullified (e.g., with Hugh or I'm a Doctor,
Not a Doorstop), all cards involved have still participated in a battle
and are "stopped."

Combat pairings - If both cards in a combat pairing have a stun effect,
or if both players wish to make a response to a combat pairing, the
player whose turn it is has the first opportunity to do so.

Damage and repair - See @{"damage" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DAMAGE"}.

Multiple targets - Borg Ship dilemmas and Borg-affiliation ships with a
Multiplexor Drone aboard are allowed to fire WEAPONS against two or more
targets in the same battle. This expands the fire (or return fire)
portion of the battle into two or more engagements. Each engagement has
only one target, but it is possible to have multiple cards firing upon
that target.

Compute separate ATTACK and DEFENSE totals for each engagement,
repeatedly using the appropriate bonuses from each player's current
tactic each time. In other words, each player is limited to one current
tactic for the battle, but it will apply to each engagement.

If your multiplexed Borg ship scores a hit (or direct hit) against two
or more targets and your current tactic has a [down] symbol, use that
card as the damage marker for one of those targets (your choice) and
treat that symbol as [flip] for damage to each remaining target. All
damage markers drawn from your side deck must be placed on the hit
targets randomly.

Winning and losing battle - Some cards, such as Discommendation and
Data's Medals, refer to the winner or loser of a battle. In a personnel
battle, the winner is the player with the higher total remaining
STRENGTH at the end of the battle. In a ship battle, the player whose
ships and/or facilities sustain the least HULL integrity loss (maximum
of 100% loss per ship or facility) during that battle is the winner.
(If the STRENGTH totals or HULL integrity losses are equal, there is no
winner or loser.)

@Endnode

@Node BATTLEBRIDGESIDEDECK "STCCG.guide/Glossary/Battle Bridge Side Deck"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}Battle Bridge Side Deck@{ub}

Your Battle Bridge side deck is an optional customized deck of special
cards separate from, and in addition to, your normal game deck. It is
shuffled and placed face down on the table, then "opened" during the
doorway seed phase by the Battle Bridge Door card. This Doorway card is
placed face up on top of your side deck and counts as one of your seed
cards (the face-down cards in the side deck do not count toward the
30/30 rule).

Your Battle Bridge side deck is made up of Tactic cards. You can have as
many Tactic cards in your side deck as you like, even duplicates.
(Tactic cards come into play only via this side deck; you cannot stock
Tactic cards in your draw deck or your Q's Tent.)

Your used Tactic cards do not go to your discard pile. Instead, whenever
one of them is discarded or otherwise leaves the table, place it face up
underneath your side deck. When your Battle Bridge side deck runs out of
face-down Tactic cards, just shuffle the face-up cards and place them
face down again underneath your seeded Battle Bridge Door.

The Tactic cards in your side deck have two main purposes: (1) to
increase your offensive and/or defensive capabilities during ship
battles and (2) to indicate specific @{"damage" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DAMAGE"} affecting your opponent's
ships and facilities.

@Endnode

@Node BEAMING "STCCG.guide/Glossary/beaming"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}beaming@{ub}

Beaming uses transporters to transfer personnel over short distances.
There is no limit to the number of times you can beam during your turn.
To beam personnel down to a planet surface, announce the beaming, remove
the cards from the ship or facility, and place them in a pile crosswise
on the Mission card. All personnel in a group beam simultaneously unless
you specify otherwise.

You can also beam personnel between ships that you control. The ships
must be at the same spaceline location and compatible with the personnel
beaming aboard. (For example, you could beam Bajoran and/or Non-Aligned
personnel onto your Bajoran or Non-Aligned ship, but you could not beam
Federation personnel aboard your Bajoran ship without a treaty.)
Announce the beaming and move the cards between the ships.

You may not beam personnel aboard an opponent's ship or facility which
is protected by SHIELDS, unless a card allows it. (Also, Borg ship
SHIELDS do not block transporter beams, except during ship battle.)

All ships and facilities have their own transporters unless the card
indicates otherwise. However, because dropping a large space station's
SHIELDS to permit beaming is risky, you are not allowed to beam cards
to, from or within a Nor without a special card. Thus, you cannot beam
from a ship docked at the Nor to the planet it orbits, between two
docked ships or between a docked ship and an undocked one.  (This does
not apply to outposts.)

Special beaming cards, such as Near-Warp Transport or Emergency
Transporter Armbands, are a form of beaming and do not allow you to
overcome any normal obstacles to beaming, such as Atmospheric
Ionization, being "stopped," etc.

  @{b}Beware of Q@{ub}

If you wish to use the first two functions of this objective, you must
seed two copies (or seed the first and play the second). If you seed
only one and have a Q-Continuum side deck, you must declare which function
you are seeding the card for.

To use the first function of this objective, you do not need to have a
Q-Continuum side deck or a seeded Q-Flash. It allows seeding of Q-icon
dilemmas only (not other Q-icon card types).

If you have completed scouting a mission, but have not completed the
objective, and either player seeds a Q-Flash under the location using
Beware of Q, then scouting is no longer complete. You must resolve the
Q-Flash to complete scouting again before you can probe on your next
turn. Or, you may use A Change of Plans to target the mission with a new
objective requiring that the mission be "not yet scouted."

However, once you have completed the objective, you may not target the
mission with another objective requiring that it be "not yet scouted,"
even by seeding a Q-Flash under the mission. Likewise, you could not
solve a mission, seed a Q-Flash under it, and then attempt and solve it
again for more points.

If this doorway "pulls in" the last location on either end

locations from the remaining side. Cards that can close a doorway (e.g.,
Revolving Door and Door-Net) suspend the Black Hole's game text and, as
a result, are not pulled in. See @{"doorways - closed" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DOORCLOSED"}.

When a ship in a Temporal Rift (or Time Travel Pod) is located at a
spaceline location that is pulled into a Black Hole, the ship is not
immediately discarded, because the ship is time traveling and thus not
really at that location; we just leave the card there to indicate where
it will eventually return. Move the ship to the Black Hole location
itself until it reappears "on schedule," at the end of a turn. If you
nullify the Temporal Rift with an Alternate Universe Door before the
time it would be pulled in, you may move the ship away before the end of
the turn and escape destruction.

This doorway may only be played between two of the missions named {univ}
Space. It does not refer to other universal space-location [S] missions,
such as {univ} Patrol Neutral Zone.

@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}Borg@{ub}

The Borg, introduced in the Star Trek: First Contact expansion in
1997, represented the first fully playable affiliation added to the game
since its premiere in 1994. There are a number of important differences
between the Borg and other affiliations.

The Collective and Hive - All of your Borg affiliation cards in play
make up your Borg collective. All of your Borg affiliation cards at one
spaceline location (or time location), whether in space, on a planet
aboard a ship or facility etc., make up a Borg hive. Some cards may
affect your entire collective; others may affect all your Borg in one
hive. In a Borg vs. Borg game, each player has a collective, and both
may have hives at the same location.

Borg Personnel - Most Borg Personnel cards represent drones. A drone's
lore lists its "Identification" (which identifies it as a particular
type of drone), a description of its "Task" and its "Biological
Distinctiveness" (species of origin; however, the species of Borg drones
is irrelevant to the Borg). Borg drones list no gender; gender is
irrelevant to the Borg. The Borg Queen and assimilated @{"counterparts" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/COUNTERPART"} such
as Locutus of Borg are not drones.

Borg personnel have no classifications, though several of the personnel
types appear as skills. Needed @{"skills" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/SKILL"}, including personnel types, which
do not appear on Borg Personnel cards may be obtained by assimilation of
opposing personnel or by using the Borg Queen's selectable skill.
Regular skills (including the Borg Queen's selected skill) may be shared
throughout a Borg hive using the @{"Interlink Drone's" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/INTERLINKDRONE"} skill. Your Borg may
also share CUNNING using the @{"Unity Drone's" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/UNITYDRONE"} skill. (Detailed examples of
the use of these skills will be found under the entries for those
drones.)

Borg special skills provide many functions supplied by Equipment cards
for other affiliations (e.g., STRENGTH enhancement for personnel, RANGE
and SHIELDS enhancement for ships). They may also use XXXequipmentX cards,
subject to certain limitations.

Each Borg drone has an icon identifying which subcommand it is assigned
to within the Borg collective. Subcommand icons are used primarily to
staff Borg ships, but also have other uses indicated by cards.

[Com] (blue) - Communication drones facilitate a hive's ability to share
  skills and CUNNING, adapt to hazards, etc.

[Nav] (green) - Navigation drones enhance warp capabilities, maintain
  and expand the Collective's transwarp network, deal with navigational
  hazards, etc.

[Def] (red) - Defense drones initiate battle and enhance offensive and
  defensive capabilities.

The Borg Queen and counterparts each have all three subcommand icons;
however, they may each meet only one @{"ship staffing" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/SHIPSTAFF"} requirement at a
time. See @{"Seven of Nine" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/7OF9"}.

Gender is irrelevant to the Borg.  Borg personnel are not affected by
gender-related game text on non-Borg cards (e.g., Love Interests,
Matriarchal Society, Alien Groupie).

Borg Affiliation Ships - Borg SHIELDS do not block transporter beams
(except during ship battle).  Thus, your opponent may normally use his
own transporters to beam his personnel and equipment to and from your
Borg ship (or outpost) at the same location. You may use your Borg ship
transporters to beam aboard your opponent's non-Borg ship or facility
through its SHIELDS if you have a Transport Drone (Two of Eleven) aboard
your ship (and if your current objective or another card or rule allows
it).

All Borg ships have a bonus point box.  These bonus points are earned by
your non-Borg opponent whenever he destroys your Borg ship in battle
(and only in battle).

Borg-affiliation ships are not affected by Plasma Fire, Warp Core
Breach, Isabella, Into The Breach, Hugh or the second function of
Anti-Matter Spread. (They are affected normally by the first function of
Anti-Matter Spread, like any other ship.)

The Delta Quadrant and Borg Outpost - All Borg affiliation cards (except
assimilated counterparts) have a {delta} icon and are native to the Delta
Quadrant. Thus, they follow quadrant rules for seeding @{"facilities" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/FACILITY"} and
reporting cards (see @{"reporting for duty" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/REPDUTY"}). Because no missions exist yet
for the Delta Quadrant, the following interim rules apply to using the
@{"Borg Outpost" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/BORGOUTP"}:

* When playing Borg you may seed one Borg Outpost on your side of the
  table, away from the spaceline.  This seeded outpost represents both an
  outpost and a location.
* This outpost/location is conceptually in the Delta Quadrant and its
  location is completely unknown to your opponent. Thus, your opponent
  (even if also playing Borg) may not move to your outpost or target the
  outpost, the location itself or any cards at the location in any way.
  For example, he may not play a Revolving Door to close a @{"Transwarp" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/TRANSWARPGATE"}
  @{"Network Gateway" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/TRANSWARPGATE"} played at the outpost, a Temporal Rift on a ship located
  at the outpost, or a Brain Drain on a personnel at the location.
* You may move your own Borg ships to and from this outpost (location)
  using cards such as @{"Transwarp Network Gateway" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/TRANSWARPGATE"}, Transwarp Conduit and
  Wormhole. You may not move your opponent's ships to this
  outpost/location (even if he is also playing Borg).
* Just as other affiliations build outposts "at any location" with a
  matching affiliation icon, Borg build outposts "at any location" they've
  assimilated (even a homeworld).  Although you may build Borg outposts on
  the Alpha or Gamma quadrant spacelines in this manner, you may not
  report cards for duty at such outposts (because the outpost is not
  native to the quadrant). You may report your Borg to the Alpha or Gamma
  quadrant using the text of such cards as the Borg Cube, Queen's Borg
  Cube, Borg Scout Vessel, Retask, Scout Encounter and Undetected Beam-In.

Cooperation - Borg don't mix or cooperate with affiliated, Neutral or
Non-Aligned cards.  Players using [Borg] affiliation cards may not
include any non-Borg personnel, ships or facilities in their game deck
or any side decks. Because Site cards have no affiliation, a Borg player
may include them in his deck. If a player has Borg and non-Borg cards
present together (The Naked Truth, Frame of Mind, etc.), normal @{"house" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/HOUSEARREST"}
@{"arrest" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/HOUSEARREST"} rules apply. (A card bearing the "Borg Use Only" icon in its
title bar can be stocked in your deck and used only when playing the
Borg affiliation.)

Objectives - Unlike other affiliations, Borg never attempt missions.
Instead, a Borg player uses Objective cards to accomplish goals such as
destroying a ship, scouting a space location or assimilating a planet.
Some Borg objectives score points; others confer different benefits,
such as destroying an enemy ship, assimilating it into the collective,
or disrupting the timeline (see @{"timeline disruption" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/TLDIS"}). (You must still
seed exactly six missions. Card elements which represent the location,
rather than the mission, still apply; these include span numbers, planet
and space icons and italicized game text such as Quash Conspiracy's "No
ship-to-ship beaming at this location.")

When you are playing Borg and you have an uncompleted [BO] (Borg Use
Only) Objective card face up in play, this is defined as your current
objective. You are limited to one [BO] current objective at a time. You
may have any number of non-[BO] objectives in play at a time. (You may
also have other [BO] cards such as incidents in play.)

When you play (or activate) a Borg Objective card, you must immediately
target an appropriate location, ship or personnel as specified by the
objective. Objectives may target solved or unsolved mission locations.
The objective then allows your Borg to scout the ship or location,
initiate battle, abduct a target etc. See @{"scouting" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/SCOUTING"}, @{"scouting locations" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/SCOUTINGLOCATIONS"},
@{"scouting ships" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/SCOUTINGSHIPS"}.

If an objective involves scouting, your Borg must complete scouting and
meet any other listed requirements (such as having Borg present at the
location) before you may probe to determine your current objective's
outcome (and score its points, if any).  See @{"probing" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/PROBING"}.

Scoring points - A Borg player scores points, both positive and
negative, only from [Borg Only] cards and cards which specify that they
affect Borg.  When you or your Borg are confronted with any other card
which is point-related, you still play out the card but ignore the
points.  (If that card presents a choice, you must choose an option
which is not point-related, if possible.)

Away Teams - Your Borg may not form Away Teams (either on a planet or on
an opponent's ship or facility) except when counter-attacking or when
allowed by your current objective or another card (e.g., Emergency
Transporter Armbands, Near-Warp Transport, Iconian Gateway, Devidian
Door).

Battle - Your Borg may not initiate battle except when counter-attacking
or when allowed by your current objective (e.g., Assimilate Counterpart,
Eliminate Starship) or another card (e.g., Conundrum, The Issue Is
Patriotism). They may attack other Borg, subject to these restrictions.

Each of your ships, facilities or Away Teams that wishes to initiate an
attack must have a [Def] personnel (or a "@{"leader" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/LEADER"}" ) present, except when
counter-attacking.

Your Borg may abduct and/or assimilate opposing personnel during
personal combat using cards such as Assimilate Counterpart, the Talon
Drone (Three of Nineteen) and Assimilation Tubules. See @{"abduction" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ABDUCTION"},
@{"assimilation" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ASSIMILATION"}.

Cards such as Rogue Borg Mercenaries, Crosis, Outpost Raid and the Borg
Ship dilemma are considered "rogue" and are not part of your collective.
Thus, they affect your Borg cards normally.

Assimilation - You may assimilate planets or your opponent's personnel
and ships by using Objective and other cards that allow assimilation.
Cards that allow you to assimilate personnel include the Talon Drone,
Assimilation Tubules, Assimilate Counterpart and Borg Servo. (Your Borg
may not assimilate personnel you have captured unless a card or rule
allows you to do so.) Assimilate Planet and Assimilate Homeworld allow
you to assimilate planets (along with any facilities that may be located
there). Assimilate Starship allows you to assimilate ships.

When personnel, ships or planets are assimilated, they come under your
control and undergo specific transformations. See @{"assimilation" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ASSIMILATION"}. The Borg
do not commandeer.

1. The dilemma is first encountered; or
2. It moves to a target's location; or
3. A target arrives at its location.

Although this dilemma has no conditions and would not normally "stop"
your ship and crew when you encounter it, the ensuing battle will. Since
it moves to a new location at the end of every turn (just before the
player's card draw) and attacks then, the attacked cards will be
"unstopped" as usual at the start of the next turn.

"Target" refers to anything that may normally attack or be attacked in a
ship/facility battle: an uncloaked ship (in space) or any facility (in
space or on a planet). Landed ships, Away Teams, or other objects in
space (e.g., Anti-Matter Pods) or on a planet are not valid targets.
When encountered and when it moves to a new location, it attacks all
targets at that location (not just the ship that encountered it). When a
target arrives at its location, it attacks only that target.

Any uncloaked ship moving to (and stopping at) or appearing at the
location of this dilemma will trigger it to attack immediately. This
includes a ship that decloaks at its location, a ship reappearing from a
Temporal Rift at its location or a ship reported at that location. A
moving ship may fly past the dilemma and avoid being attacked. A ship
decloaking or being reported to that location is not moving and cannot
escape attack in this fashion.

If you have unstopped ships at the location of the Borg Ship dilemma
during your turn, they may attack the dilemma. It will retaliate against
all ships (and facilities) that attacked it (but not other targets that
were not involved in the attack).

The battle is conducted exactly like a normal ship battle, with the
exception that the Borg Ship dilemma attacks multiple targets and
attacks each target with its full WEAPONS of 24. See @{"battle" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/BATTLE"}. Hits,
direct hits and damage to the Borg Ship dilemma are calculated and
applied as if it were a ship.

Battle Bridge side decks affect this dilemma as follows:

* When battling the Borg Ship dilemma, you may use a current tactic and
  may place damage markers on the dilemma if appropriate.
* The dilemma does not use either player's Tactic cards; thus, your
  ships and facilities it hits suffer default damage if your opponent is
  using a Battle Bridge side deck (or card rotation damage if your
  opponent is not). (See @{"damage" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DAMAGE"}.)
* When the dilemma is attacking both players' cards, it does so as two
  separate battles. (As always, the player whose turn it is chooses which
  happens first.)
* If both players have damaged the Borg Ship dilemma but only one of
  them has a Battle Bridge side deck, some of the dilemma's damage will be
  indicated by damage markers and some of it will be indicated by card
  rotation. The card rotation damage is equivalent to HULL -50% and
  combines with the damage markers to determine whether the Borg Ship
  dilemma is destroyed.

The Borg Ship dilemma has a bonus point box.  These bonus points are
earned when a non-Borg player destroys the dilemma in battle (and only
in battle).

The Borg Ship dilemma is considered "rogue" and not part of a Borg
collective. Thus, it affects Borg-affiliation cards normally.

The Borg Ship dilemma is not affected by Plasma Fire, Warp Core Breach,
Isabella, Into The Breach or the first function of Anti-Matter Spread.
(It is affected only by the second function of Anti-Matter Spread.) See
@{"Hugh" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/HUGH"}.

The Borg Ship dilemma is not a ship and therefore is not affected by
cards that affect ships (such as Calamarain, Q-Net, Wormholes etc.). It
is treated like a ship only with respect to battle.

  @{b}Brainwash@{ub}

This event removes all affiliation-based restrictions on using the
Brainwashed personnel "as your own." Examples:

1. Not only will Galen work with the Federation if Brainwashed, he will
work with a Brainwashed Federation personnel even if not Brainwashed
himself.

2. The Borg may Brainwash a non-Borg captive. The Brainwashed captive is
not assimilated and thus may not share skills with the Borg. He may not
be used to scout (because he is not Borg), but may be used to attempt
missions of his affiliation (though the Borg may not join him because
they do not attempt missions). If the Brainwashed personnel solves a
mission, the Borg player will not score the mission points. The Borg may
use the captive's skills for purposes other than scouting. For example,
if he had SCIENCE classification or skill, he could enhance SHIELDS with
Metaphasic Shields in play; a Brainwashed android could prevent the ship
from being relocated at Paxan "Wormhole."

3. Other affiliations may Brainwash a Borg captive.  The Brainwashed
Borg will work with that affiliation, but may not join mission attempts
(because it is still Borg).  However, the Brainwashed  Borg may be used
in other ways. For example, if it is an ENGINEER, it could facilitate
carrying and launching shuttles with Engage Shuttle Operations; if it
has Navigation skill, it could help deal with cards such as Tetryon
Field and Anti-Matter Pod. A Brainwashed Borg in your crew or Away Team
does not add Borg attack restrictions. A Brainwashed Talon Drone could
assimilate an opposing personnel stunned in battle; it would immediately
be placed under house arrest (or would become a separate Away Team).

This event plays "at location of opponent's choice." That location may

  @{b}capturing@{ub}

Some cards and rules allow you to capture your opponent's personnel
(never a personnel you control). Captured personnel are @{"disabled" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DISABLED"} as
long as they are captives (unless affected by Brainwash). The captives
will be escorted by your personnel as follows:

* When first captured, captives are immediately relocated to one of your
  crews or Away Teams at that location, if possible.
* Otherwise, the capturing card remains in play and serves as a
  temporary "trap" to hold the captives on your side of that location
  until your personnel can arrive to take them into custody. (If there is
  a planet at that location, the trap is on the planet.) Your ship with
  transporters (in space) or your Away Team (on a planet) can subsequently
  take custody of the captives if present with the trap, then discard the
  trap card.

Each of your crews and Away Teams may escort any number of captives, and
may move them around like Equipment cards.

At any given time a captive can be in one of three conditions: (1) held
by a trap or in a Brig or by escorting personnel, (2) Brainwashed or (3)
left unattended. You may change the captive's condition during your
turn.

All captured cards are returned to their owner at the end of the game.

Brigs - Some cards allow you to add a Brig to a ship or facility. While
you control the ship or facility, you may move captured personnel into
and out of the Brig during your turn (while in the Brig they are held
but not escorted). If your opponent commandeers or assimilates the ship
or facility, his personnel may subsequently release any of his other
personnel held captive in the Brig (if present).

Rescue - Captives that are held or Brainwashed may be rescued only by
using a card that specifically rescues or releases captives (such as
Rescue Captives, His Honor The High Sheriff of Nottingham or Prisoner
Exchange). Unattended captives, however, are conceptually "tied up and
left behind" and thus may be rescued by their owner's other personnel
present, without any special card. Whenever a captive is rescued or
released, all @{"capturing-related" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/CAPTURERELATED"} cards played on that captive are
discarded.

A "card draw" refers to any card drawn from the draw deck,
either as the player's end-of-turn draw(s) or through the use of a card
that specifies that you "draw cards," such as Kivas Fajo - Collector.
Each card drawn is a separate action.

An action that is "in place of one card draw" may replace any card draw.
Unless the action is restricted to once per turn, you may replace as
many card draws as you are entitled to. For example, downloads with the
Borg Queen's special skill may replace any or all of the three card
draws from Kivas Fajo - Collector. The replacement action must be
performed at the time you would normally make that card draw.

You may perform as many actions as you like each turn that have the
restriction "draw no cards this turn" (e.g., playing a Q's Tent, playing
a Ready Room Door to download a matching commander). You may not then
draw any more cards for the remainder of the turn, by any means (normal
card draw, Kivas Fajo - Collector, Masaka Transformations etc.), or use
an ability (such as the Borg Queen's special skill) that allows you to
perform an action in place of a card draw. Cards chosen from your deck

A "card play" refers to any card played by any means (normal card play
for the turn, normal interrupt or doorway play, a card played "for free,"
downloaded into play, Devidian Door, etc.). See @{"reporting for duty" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/REPDUTY"}.

Your "normal card play" is defined as your one allowed card play on each
turn. Although optional, this must take place before you execute any
orders. Interrupts and doorways do not use up (or count as) your
"normal" card play, nor do any cards brought into play via another
mechanism (such as downloading), unless otherwise specified.

An action that is "in place of your normal card play" must be performed
when you would make your normal card play, at the start of your turn,
before executing orders. Such an action may be a group action with
several sub-actions; interrupts may not be played between those
sub-actions. See @{"actions" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ACTION"}. Because you have only one normal card play
each turn, only one such "replacement" action may be performed each
turn. For example, Spacedoor allows you to download a universal ship in
place of your normal card play. Two Spacedoors will not allow you to
download two ships.

When game text in play allows you to launch ships from other ships, it

because Engage Shuttle Operations allows you to launch shuttlecraft, it

  @{b}Cloaked Ship@{ub}

A cloaked ship is invisible to other ships and cannot be
attacked, yet it can move normally. (An opponent can verify the RANGE of
a cloaked ship.) A cloaked ship may not participate in battle, use a
tractor beam, load or unload personnel or equipment (either by beaming
or docking at a facility), or attempt or scout a mission.

A cloaked ship can be affected by cards representing cosmic phenomena or
spontaneous events that are independent of the visibility of the ship,
as well as cards representing actions of personnel aboard the cloaked
ship. Examples of cards that can affect cloaked ships are Magnetic
North, Temporal Rift and Plasma Fire. A cloaked ship cannot be affected
by external actions that would logically require that your opponent or
some lifeform could see or sense the ship, such as Establish Tractor
Lock or Long-Range Scan.

A cloaked ship, and the crew aboard, may not affect anything external to
the ship, unless the effect is logically unrelated to the visibility of
the ship and would not result in detection of the ship. Thus, a cloaked
ship may move, dock and undock, but may not attempt or scout a mission,
initiate battle or "hail" a passing ship (i.e., you may not play Hail on
a ship passing your cloaked ship). A ship must be decloaked to prevent
nullification of Post Garrison or the opponent's completion of Patrol
Neutral Zone.

You may probe for an objective involving a cloaked ship (or its crew)
only if the objective's target and results of a successful probe are
internal to the ship. For example, Assimilate Planet targets a planet
mission and has a successful outcome of assimilating the planet. If your
Borg at the location are aboard a ship, the ship may not be cloaked when
you probe, because a successful probe affects a planet external to the
ship. Assimilate Counterpart targets a personnel and has a successful
outcome of assimilating the counterpart. You may probe for this
objective if the counterpart is on an Assimilation Table aboard a
cloaked ship, because the effects are internal to the ship.

Cards may report to a cloaked ship (when allowed by a card such as Ready
Room Door, Borg Cube, Dr. Telek R'Mor or The Emissary).

Two cards are of compatible affiliation if their affiliation icons
can work together (e.g., they are the same affiliation, or at least
one is Non-Aligned or Neutral, or they are allowed to mix and cooperate
by another card).

If a card allows cards of different affiliations to "mix" (or "mix and
cooperate"), those cards are compatible with each other. Some cards that
make different affiliations compatible are Treaty cards, Brainwash,
Ferengi Trading Post (only while aboard) and Memory Wipe. Cards of
different affiliations may not mix and cooperate unless allowed by such
a card.

Compatible personnel, ships, facilities, equipment, etc. can all be
shared by the player as if they were one affiliation. However, you must
still have a personnel of @{"matching affiliation" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/MATCHAFF"} when required by a card
or rule.

Example: If you have a Treaty: Romulan/Cardassian in play, your Romulan,
Cardassian, Non-Aligned (and Neutral) cards are compatible with your
Cardassian Outpost and Nor, but your Klingon cards are not. (Only your
Cardassian cards match the Outpost and Nor.)

* Your Romulan and Non-Aligned cards may report to your Cardassian
  Outpost or Nor (but may not be downloaded using the Ops text).
* Your Romulan and Non-Aligned personnel may staff your Cardassian ship,
  if at least one [Car] personnel is aboard (see @{"ship staffing" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/SHIPSTAFF"}).
* You may attempt a mission using a mixed Romulan/Cardassian/Non-Aligned
  crew or Away Team as long as at least one personnel matches one of the
  mission's affiliation icons.

If a card allowing compatibility is nullified or destroyed, incompatible
personnel aboard a ship or facility are placed under @{"house arrest" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/HOUSEARREST"}. If a
mixed crew is aboard a Non-Aligned ship or facility, the affiliation
with the fewest personnel present (if a tie, determine randomly) is put
under house arrest. If a mixed crew or Away Team is on a planet, in a
planet facility or at a site, the non-compatible personnel form a
separate crew (under house arrest) or Away Team. (Only the Away Team
matching a ship's affiliation may return to the ship. The non-compatible
personnel may be picked up only by a compatible ship.)

If a mixed Away Team becomes incompatible and splits during a mission
attempt, only one Away Team can and must continue the attempt (owner's
choice if both are eligible to continue). If a mixed crew becomes
incompatible during a mission attempt, the crew that is not placed under
house arrest must continue the attempt.

You may activate this hidden agenda event as a response to an
attempt to play a Q's Tent or a card requiring downloading (e.g.,
Activate Subcommands), or an attempt to download a card (e.g., by using
the Borg Queen's skill or any special download icon). The Q's Tent or
card requiring downloading becomes an illegal card play and returns to
the owner's hand; an attempted download is simply aborted (and does not
use up any resource). See @{"actions - step2: optional responses" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ACRESPONSE"}.

If you initiate the play of a multi-function card such as Bajoran Civil
War, and select a function that requires a download, then that card
becomes a "card that requires downloading" and may be responded to by
the activation of this event. The card requiring downloading returns to
your hand; you may then play it for its other function, but you are not
required to do so.

A card may allow but not require downloading, and thus may be played
despite Computer Crash. For example, Assign Mission Specialists plays on
the table for an ongoing effect, and additionally allows the download of
two personnel. If Computer Crash is activated in response to the
attempted download, the download cannot be made, but the card remains in
play.

You may not activate this event in response to your opponent's personnel
download with a seeded Assign Mission Specialists. Seeded hidden agendas
may not be activated during the seed phase.

When you temporarily control a ship and crew with a card
such as @{"Alien Parasites" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/ALPARASITES"} or Neural Servo Device, treat the ship
and personnel as if they were your own with regard to attempting
missions, encountering dilemmas and Q-Flashes, scoring points, playing
cards that play on "your ship" (such as Auto-Destruct Sequence), etc.
The only exception is that you may not bring the personnel aboard one of
your ships or facilities and you may not bring your personnel aboard
their ship.

You may use only "legal moves" - e.g., the ship and crew must still obey
affiliation attack restrictions, may attempt only missions of
appropriate affiliation, must obey Borg restrictions etc. Within those
constraints, you may move the ship, abandon personnel on planets, engage
in battle, attempt missions (if you solve a mission, you score its
points), etc.

Only your own treaties, ship enhancement cards etc. apply to the
controlled cards (other than cards played on the ship). Thus, your
Bynars Weapons Enhancement would increase the ship's WEAPONS, while your
opponent's Metaphasic Shields would not increase its SHIELDS. A Kurlan
Naiskos on the ship would continue to enhance it if properly staffed.

change targets at any time. If the target at any time becomes invalid

A Borg personnel with "assimilated counterpart" in his

Assimilate Homeworld. A counterpart is not a drone and may not be
downloaded or affected by cards that specify drones.

Your collective is limited to one counterpart in play at a time, even if
that counterpart has an [AU] icon. This restriction is similar to the
@{"persona" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/PERSONA"} and "Unique" card rules, which allow you to have only one copy
of a unique personnel (or its persona) in play at a time, one Dead End
etc. Thus, if you have one counterpart in play, you may not play or
assimilate another, and if you acquire another one (e.g., from a
@{"Cryosatellite" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/CRYO"}), the second one must be discarded.

Because the assimilated counterparts do not have Delta Quadrant icons,
you may not report them to a facility in the Delta Quadrant, or to a

assimilated counterpart may be reported to a Borg Cube in any quadrant,

This dilemma "kills all life on ship," including personnel who

rule that dilemmas affect only the personnel in the crew or Away Team
that encounters the dilemma. See @{"lore" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/LORE"}.

If this dilemma is encountered after DNA Clues and thus requires 2 more
MEDICAL, and Lore is in play (doubling Crystalline Entity), it will
require 6 MEDICAL and 2 SCIENCE to pass the dilemma. Lore doubles
whatever Crystalline Entity requires, and DNA Clues makes it require 3
MEDICAL and SCIENCE.

If this dilemma is encountered at a dual-icon mission, the Away Team and

  @{b}cumulative@{ub}

If a card is marked "Cumulative," multiple copies of the
card can increasingly modify or affect the same thing, action, seed
phase or turn. Although not so marked, multiple copies of the same
damage marker (Tactic cards) are cumulative, including reductions to
attributes and HULL integrity. All other cards are non-cumulative unless
specifically marked "Cumulative."

For example, Romulan Disruptor says, "Each of your personnel STRENGTH +2
where present. (Cumulative.)" Three Romulan Disruptors would therefore
add 6 to the STRENGTH of each of your personnel present. Conversely,
Science Kit says, "Gives all of your OFFICER-classification personnel
the extra skill of SCIENCE where present." Three Science Kits will only
give an OFFICER one SCIENCE skill, not SCIENCE x3.

Other examples of non-cumulative cards:

* The Traveler: Transcendence: Two copies will not allow you to draw two
  extra cards each turn.

* Destroy Radioactive Garbage Scow: While you may play two copies to
  destroy two Scows at the same location, you may only reduce the
  mission's points once.

* End Transmission: You may not delay the same actions a second time by
  playing a second copy of End Transmission on your next turn. (The second
  copy will delay any new end-of-turn actions only.)

* Open Diplomatic Relations: Two copies will not allow you to seed two
  Treaties during the doorway phase.

* Space-Time Portal: Two copies will not allow you to play two [AU]
  cards per turn.

It does not prevent ships from being placed in stasis (e.g., by the

ships and crews in stasis at the time it is encountered, if the Cyber
Drone is beamed off the ship, the remaining Borg will remain active.

@Node DAMAGE "STCCG.guide/Glossary/Damage"
@TOC MAIN
@INDEX INDEX

  @{b}Damage@{ub}

When you are using a Battle Bridge side deck, any damage to
your opponent's ships, whether from a "hit" in battle, dilemmas or other
causes, is indicated by damage markers, which are Tactic cards from your
side deck. (See ship battle rules in the Rulebook for details on
determining a "hit" or "direct hit" in battle.) The damage results
appear at the bottom of each Tactic card.

Some damage results are immediate and have a one-time effect (such as
killing a crew member or downloading a Warp Core Breach). Other damage
results have an ongoing effect (such as reduced attributes, off-line
transporters or fluctuating shields) as long as that damage marker is in
play. Most damage markers also specify a reduction to HULL integrity.
When a ship's or facility's HULL is reduced to 0%, it is destroyed.

Multiple copies of the same damage marker are cumulative, including
reductions to attributes and HULL integrity.

If you are not using a Battle Bridge side deck, any damage to your
opponent's ship is indicated by rotating the target 180 degrees to
indicate that it is damaged, with these effects: RANGE is reduced to 5
(if it is already less than 5, it remains the same), Cloaking Device is
off line and HULL integrity is reduced by 50%. If you scored a direct
hit in battle, HULL integrity is reduced by 100% and the target is thus
immediately destroyed. If a ship with "rotation damage" is damaged again
before it is repaired, the additional HULL integrity reduction of 50%
also destroys the ship.

If your side deck is ever completely out of Tactic cards (because they
are all in play as damage markers), you will be unable to further damage
your opponent until some of your damage markers return to your side
deck. You may not mix damage markers and "rotation damage" on your
opponent's ship.

"Off line" - When a damage result indicates that something is "off
line," the affected item may not be used in any way as long as that
damage marker is in play. Attribute enhancements being off line affects
all enhancements to the specified attribute (but ATTACK and DEFENSE
bonuses are conceptually based on battle strategies and tactics, and
thus are not considered enhancements to WEAPONS and SHIELDS).

Default damage - When you are using a Battle Bridge side deck, sometimes
your opponent's ship or facility will be damaged when you do not have a
current tactic (such as when encountering a dilemma or during a battle
in which you choose not to play a current tactic). Whenever this occurs,
the default damage is two cards from your side deck, or four cards for a
direct hit.

Order of damage results - In most cases, the sequence in which you apply
damage results will not matter. Once in a while, though, the order may
be significant. In these cases, carry out immediate damage results first
and check the HULL reduction last.

For example, suppose the HULL integrity of your opponent's ship has
already been reduced by 80% when it is damaged again, and the two damage
markers from your side deck each specify one casualty and HULL -30%.
Normally the casualties are moot because the ship is about to be
destroyed. However, if your opponent wants to play an Escape Pod, he
must suffer both casualties first, so the Escape Pod saves only the
remaining crew.

Repair - If your ship's damage is indicated by your opponent's damage
markers, you may remove one damage marker (random selection) at the end
of each of your turns that ship remains docked at an outpost or at a
Docking Pylons site for the full turn.

Whenever a ship or facility is fully repaired (for example, by a card
such as Defense System Upgrade, Exocomp, Into the Breach, Regenerate or
Spacedock), remove all of its damage markers. Damage markers are also
removed if the ship or facility leaves play for any reason (for example,
being returned to hand or placed out-of-play).

If your ship's damage is not indicated by your opponent's damage markers
but by card rotation instead (because he is not using a Battle Bridge
side deck), you may repair it by docking at an outpost that makes
repairs or a Docking Pylons site for two of your full turns. (Any
outpost can make repairs unless its text says it does not. A Spacedock
played on an outpost allows immediate repair of ships that dock there,
even if the outpost itself does not allow repairs.)
