    Behind the scenes:
    Because the image of the baseball card seen in "The Most Toys" was too
    small to achieve the desired level of detail, we purchased an original
    copy of the actual 35-year-old Roger Maris card and then made high-
    resolution digital scans.

    From the @{"Glossary" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/MAIN"}:

You may not trade this artifact for another unless you
are immediately able to play that artifact as your own
(this does not count as your normal card play). Traded
artifacts are returned to their owners at the end of
the game. See @{"in play" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/INPLAY"}.

    From the @{"Glossary" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/MAIN"}:

This artifact has revised game text (clarification):
Those personnel come aboard your ship when Cryosatellite earned or
acquired.

All cards seeded with this artifact count as seed cards.

If you earn your Cryosatellite containing another copy of a unique
personnel you already have in play (or another version of the same @{"persona" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/PERSONA"}),
the one in the Cryosatellite is discarded. See @{"unique and universal" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/UNIQUEANDUNIVERSAL"}.
If the Cryosatellite contains two versions of the same @{"persona" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/PERSONA"}
(e.g., Lakanta and The Traveler) or two or more assimilated
counterparts (e.g., Tomalak of Borg and Gowron of Borg), the first one
encountered will join your crew while any others will be discarded. You
may not select one to keep or leave personnel on the Cryosatellite.

If you earn your own Cryosatellite, but the personnel are not compatible
with your crew, they are placed under @{"house arrest" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/HOUSEARREST"}. If you earn your
opponent's Cryosatellite, you capture any personnel and earn any
artifact found there. The personnel still belong to your opponent;
duplicates and additional counterparts and versions of personas are
discarded as if he had earned them.

    Behind the scenes:
    What can we say... it's surreal. Decipher creative director Dan Burns
    challenged the product development team to create a game effect worthy of
    this painting nefariously acquired by Kivas Fajo. Simulating the distorted
    time depicted in the Dali masterpiece, this artifact "warps" a number of
    prominent cards in many powerful and entertaining ways. We're sure you'll
    have a great time playing with it.
    Speaking of time... While Decipher's been in business since 1983, it's
    amazing that in just three short years of making customizable card games,
    we've made more than 1,200,000,000 (yes, 1.2 billion!) cards. To put that
    in perspective, imagine that you are walking around the Earth at the
    equator. (Better get some good waterproof sneakers for this trek.) As
    you go, you're laying our cards end to end. By the time you're done,
    you've walked all the way around the world -- over two and a half times.

    Behind the scenes:
    The only existing Q artifact! Creating cards like this one is a labor
    of love for Decipher artists. We've always employed a prorietary software
    system to obtain state-of-the-art "frame pulls" from Paramount's digital
    masters. (This process is over fifty times more expensive than other
    systems typically used to obtain card images.) Although these digital
    pulls are of extraordinary quality, our artists further enhance them,
    using talent and computing power rivaling that used to make today's best
    motion picture special effects. Also, in the Fajo Collection, special
    printing techniques are used to elevate card images to levels never
    before achieved in any collectible card game. In thecase of Picard's
    Artificial Heart, the surface of the heart is printed with a fifth color
    of metallic blue ink and a sixth color of metallic gold.
