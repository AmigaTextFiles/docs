  @{b}Caretaker@{ub}

A starship controlled by the Maquis mysteriously disappears in the
Badlands, a charged energy field near the demilitarized zone, after
being pursued by a Cardassian ship. U.S.S. Voyager, commanded by
Captain Janeway, is dispatched from DS9 to the Badlands to find out
where the Maquis ship went, especially since a Starfleet security
operative, Vulcan Lt. Tuvok, was aboard. Arriving in the Badlands,
the Voyager is scanned by an unknown presence and then ripped out of
the Alpha Quadrant by a subspace phenomenon that causes heavy damage
and kills many of the crew. Voyager ends up in an unexplored part of
the galaxy where the first thing the crew sees is an energy collection
array. While repairs are being made, Janeway and her crew are kidnapped
from the ship via transporter and deposited in a virtual reality, the
inhabitants of which conduct experiments on the Alpha Quadrant visitors
and then return them - minus helmsman Ensign Kim. Making contact with
the Maquis crew commanded by Chakotay, Janeway discovers that the same
tests were forced upon the renegades and that one of their number has
also been abducted. A tenuous truce is arranged so that both crews can
recover their missing comrades. Esign Kim and Maquis engineer B'elanna
Torres, in the meantime, have been beamed to the planet Ocampa, a
barren wasteland of a world whose short-lived inhabitants live under-
ground. There they are attended to by the Ocampa, who have been instructed
by the Caretaker to look after the two visitors since they have somehow
become infected with a terminal illness. Voyager's crew track their
missing comrades to Ocampa and encounter the scavenger Neelix, who offers
to be the crew's guide through this part of space. His knowledge of the
local area is invaluable, such as the revelation that water is a rarity
and is valuable currency here. The crew is also introduced to the Kazons,
who roam the surface of Ocampa foraging a meager existence. They hand
over a captive Ocampa named Kes in exchange for some water from Voyager.
Shortly after Kes leads the crew to Kim and Torres, the energy array
shuts down after transmitting a final burst of power to Ocampa. The
Kazons make a gambit to claim the array for themselves, but Chakotay
and Tom Paris, a dishonored former Maquis member aboard the Voayger,
battle the scavengers off with their respective starships as Janeway
and Tuvok beam to the array and findn the elderly and dying Caretaker,
whose race accidentally destroyed the Ocampan ecosphere and then built
the subterranean habitat and the power array so the Ocampa could survive.
The Caretaker must be succeeded by another and has been trying to find
a replacement for decades, but so far all of those tested for their
suitability - such as Kim and Torres - have not proven adequate to the
task. The Caretaker decides to set the array to self-destruct to avoid
allowing the Ocampa to be enslaved by the Kazons. In the fierce battle
with the Kazons, Chakotay's Maquis ship is destroyed when he rams it into
the lead Kazon ship, which then collides with the array, disabling the
self-destruct sequence. Janeway beams back to the Voyager and destroys
the array herself, though it could have sent her and her crew back to
the Alpha Quadrant - and with Kes and Neelix in tow - the ship sets a
course back home, E.T.A.: 75 years...

B'elanna Torres faces the prospect of a court-martial after hitting Carey,
the senior surviving member of Voyager's engineering crew, and Janeway balks
when Chakotay nominates Torres for the position of chief engineer. Before a
choice can be made, Voyager encounters a quantum singularity that appears to
have trapped a ship. After an attempt to snag the distant derelict with the
tractor beam, Voyager is forced to back off as the crew hatches alternate plans
to retrieve the other ship. At Chakotay's insistence, Janeway includes Torres
in the process, and B'elanna manages to come up with a working theory that the
other ship is Voyager, already trapped in the singularity. If she can manage to
free the ship from the phenomenon, B'elanna may prove herself adequate to the
task of becoming Voyager's chief engineer.

Exploring a planet which has very recently been rendered uninhabitable by a
global disaster, Janeway and Paris are separated from the rest of their away
team and somehow find themselves in the same place, but hours before the
cataclysm that consumed the planet's entire civilization. Their attempts to
remain anonymous while trying to find a way back to their own present land them
in the middle of a protest against a polaric energy plant, which may be the
cause of the world's destruction. At first, Janeway is adamant that the Prime
Directive be adhered to, but when she discovers the possiblity that her presence
may have caused the disaster in the first place, the captain decides to set
aside Starfleet's first rule.

Searching for deposits of refinable dilithium, Voyager stops off at a moon,
where Chakotay, Kim and Neelix beam to the surface. It turns out that this
moon is not uninhabited. A group of aliens there seem to have left a dilithium
trail, and one of them attacks Neelix. When the others come to his aid, Neelix's
lungs have been removed, and only some innovative but risky gambles taken by
Voyager's holographic doctor can keep him barely alive. The aliens flee the moon
in their own ship, and Janeway orders a pursuit. It turns out that the attackers
are simply trying to survive themselves, their species all but wiped out by a
deadly disease. Their only hope for survival is to take working organs from
others - and they cannot return to lungs to Neelix, for they have already been
used.

Investigating a nebula whose energy currents could replenish the ship's engines
and other systems, Voyager penetrates the gases of the nebula, which turns out to
be a huge life form. The ship's entry injures the creature, and Voyager barely
makes it back into open space intact. Though it will further deplete the ship's
energy reserves, Janeway feels that the crew is obligated to return to the
nebula-entity and repair the damage caused by Voyager's intrusion.

Harry's sensor sweeps for space anomalies detect a wormhole which
Janeway diverts Voyager off course to investigate. Though a probe is
able to determine that the wormhole leads homeward to the Alpha
Quadrant, the wormhole is too small to travel through. When the
probe is scanned by a ship on the other side, the crew begin using
it as a relay satellite and make contact with a Romulan ship. Though
the Romulan captain is skeptical of Janeway's claim that Voyager is in
the Delta Quadrant, he eventually realizes the truth and offers to
help transmit messages home. Later, B'elanna discovers a possible
way to beam through the wormhole to the Romulan ship, but this method
of returning to the Alpha Quadrant is halted by an unforseeable problem.

Harry Kim wakes up in San Francisco where he finds himself in bed with
his fiancee. He is a bright young Starfleet engineer, and his friend
Ensign Danny Byrd got his slot on the Voyager which disappeared several
months before, yet the last thing Harry remembers is piloting one of
Voyager's shuttles in the Delta Quadrant. His efforts to make sense of
the situation make his superiors suspect that Harry is a Maquis spy. He
discovers that he is in an alternate timeline and finds allies in strange
places as he tries to return to his own reality.

With the crew excited at the prospect of a new source of sirillium,
Voyager approaches a Class 17 nebula gaseous anomaly, but at the
sight of it on the viewscreen Tuvok experiences a flashback to what
is apparently a traumatic experience in his youth. Yet it is not an
episode from Tuvok's past and the Doctro has no explanation, except
for the observation that Tuvok's neural synapses break down each
time the "memory" returns. When Tuvok begins to express concern over
finding cloaked Klingon ships "this close to Klingon space" he
decides to regress using the technique of the Vulcan mind meld,
asking Janeway to be his guide and counselor. She joins in his
memory as an outside observer to objectify the experience. Yet he
does not return to the memory in question but to a memory of his
first deep-space assignment, 80 years previously aboard the Excelsior.
It is here that the source of the mystery lies, but they are fighting
time as Tuvok's neural synapses continue to degrade and Janeway
suddenly becomes a participant in Tuvok's memory and not just an
observer.

Distressed at the loss of his family and an entire colony of his

time manipulation and can obliterate history, making entire lifeforms
and civilizations cease to have ever existed. In this way, he hopes to
restore his loved ones by erasing the enemy that caused their deaths.
His well-calculated plans are thwarted by the incursion of the U.S.S.
Voyager. Captain Janeway and her crew come between Annorax and his
plans, for which it seems he will make good on his promise to destroy
the starship.

A cripple U.S.S. Voyager, structurally weakened and shattered beyond
operation, hides from the pursuing Krenim weapon-ship, in the conclusion
of a two part story. Most of the crew has abandoned the U.S.S. Voyager,
leaving only a skeletal staff and the determined Captain Janeway on-board.
With whole segments of the proud starship missing, and life-support
systems failing, Captain Janeway is adamant about defeating the Krenim
or going down with her ship.
