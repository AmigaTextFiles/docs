        @{b}BeeR's Deck Idea #1@{ub}

Welcome to BeeR's Deck Ideas!

I've been playing STCCG for more than a year now and I've come with a lot of
great Decks built around themes (I always built deck around themes because
experience showed that no matter how powerful your deck is, it always relies
on good drawing order (luck), so why not have fun when building your decks?)
In my next post, I will show you how to evaluate the odds when you draw your
cards from your deck and believe me, they're low,low,low.

So, here's my first Deck Idea and this one almost doesn't rely on luck.

Romulans -Arch/Trea-

Missions:

Strategic Diversion          skills required to complete all missions:
Wormhole Negotiations        Treachery x 12
Plunder Site                 Archaeology x 4
Sarthong Plunder
Excavation
Secret Salvage

Personnel _required_ ( you should add 4 more at least,
with complementary skills)

Galathon x 2
Taul x 2
Sela
D'Tan
Pardek
Baran
Ocett
Taibak
Bok
Jo'Bril
Berlingoff Rasmussen

Of course, this is only the core. I once played with 4 Galathon and 4 Taul.
Try to stay between 30 and 35 cards for your draw pile, this way you're
pretty shure to have the cards you need in no time. With almost everyone
having the skills required, you should be able to complete any mission while
your opponent stumbles on your 23 dilemmas.

Two problems so far: Thine own self. It's tempting to play a red shirt
strategy because (almost) everyone is expendable.
Second, you have five missions with multi affiliations so you have to put
some of your dilemmas on them just to be sure.

Next time: Klingon - L'Armada- and a small course about the Hypergeo-
metric law!

        @{b}BeeR's Deck Idea #2@{ub}

Here's my Deck Idea #2, the purest of the purests Klingon Armada decks.
It basically includes ALL the Klingons Officers and those with Leadership.
It has 10 ships, 8 of wich are K'Vort class. No Non-Aligned whatsoever.
Only one Event: a Red Alert. You can put two if you want to be safer.

Klingon -L'Armada- AKA  -The Way Of The Warriors-

Personnel:
Batrell
B'Etor
B'iJik
Duras
Governor Worf
Gowron
Kargan
Klag
K'mpec
K'mtar
Konmel
Korris
Kurn
K'Vada
L'Kor
Lursa
Morag
Nu'Daq
Toral (I said everyone!)

Ships:
I.K.C. Bortas
I.K.C. Buruk
I.K.C. Hegh'ta
I.K.C. K'Vort x4
I.K.C. Pagh
I.K.C. Qu'Vat
I.K.C. Vorn
(No K'Ratak because of it's poor range)

Events:
Red Alert!  (x2?)
Captain'Log (?)
Bynars WE   (?)

Doorways:
AU Doorway (seeded)

        @{b}BeeR's Deck Idea #3@{ub}

Hi everyone!
It seems I am the only one to write about deck ideas now that we don't
hear from Movar. :-(
I think that this is a _great_ subject and a punishment for all those who
don't read r.g.t.s and are stuck with their sole mind to invent new decks
while we put our minds together to construct the ultimate deck, the deck
that will kill'em all (especially my opponent)! >:-)

This is a quest for many. I shall not succeed alone.

Now, to change the subject completely, here's a not-so-powerful-but-very-
funny-to-play deck Not so powerful because if your opponent(s) know the
cards well, they can guess what's in your draw pile.

Deck idea #3:
Fed-Families

Personnel:
Jack Crusher                     Nikolai Rozhenko
Wesley Crusher                   Alexander Rozhenko
Beverly Crusher                  K'Ehleyr
Beverly Picard                   Worf
Jean-Luc Picard
Lt (j.g.) Picard                 Fed/Romulan
Dr LaForge                       Sela
Geordi LaForge
Lwaxana Troi                     Fed/Klingon:
Deanna Troi                      Kurn
Ian Andrew Troi                  K'mtar
Major Rakal                      Gov. Worf
William T.Riker                  the four Duras
Thomas Riker
Tasha Yar                        Klin/Rom
Tasha Yar - Alternate            Ba'el
Ishara Yar                       Tokath
                                 the four Duras

Lots of Honor, Diplomacy, Leadership, Navigation and Computer Skill. That
should make no problems for choosing your missions.

Hi, everyone!

For my fourth Deck Idea, I've decided to postpone my Fed -One Man Show-
until I've tested it because it may be a "pure" theme deck (unplayable)

So here's BDI#4: Fed -Harem-
*IT IS PLAYABLE* and it did win against my 3 affiliation treaty deck

Personnel:

Deanna
Miss Shelby (lots of character)
Jenna (for the Androids)
Linda
Miss Taitt
Miss McKnight
Tasha (both)
Leah (the *real* one...)
Vash (not useful but I couldn't resist)

The Older ones:
Beverly (both)
Rachel
Neela
Alynna
Mrs Shanti

The Aliens:
Vekor
Jaxa
Laren
K'Ehleyr (for the tough ones)
Mrs Selar (a doctor)

Missions: (I will skip the comments, it is PG-13)

Investigate Massacre
Diplomacy Mission
FGC-47 Research
Explore Black Cluster
Study "Hole In Space"
Study Stellar Collision

I know there are better missions for this theme (First Contact?) but it is
a playable deck.

Events:

Goddess of Empathy
Red Alert! (after all, there is a lot of personnel)

(*new adds*)
Alien Probe
Mot's Advice


Interrupts:
Alien Groupie
Jamaharon
Amanda Rogers
La Forge Maneuver
Dead in Bed


Artifacts:
Horgan'hn
Thought Maker

Dilemmas:

Parallel Romance
Martriarchal Society
Male's Love Interest
Anaphasic Organism

etc...

        @{b}BeeR's Deck Idea #5@{ub}

Here's my fifth Deck Idea, this one is not a theme deck but a deck that
follows rules #2,3,4 and now 5 of my Holy Deck Rules.
To date, it won 2 out of 3 games, the only defeat beeing against a similar
deck of the same affiliation.


BeeR's Deck Idea #5: Romulan -Planet Power-

Missions:
Investigate Raid
Covert Installation
Expose Covert Supply
Strategic Diversion
Covert Rescue
Sensitive Search

Personnel:
Bok
Cmdr Tomalak
Dathon
Lakanta
N'Vek
Major Rakal
Maques
Mendak
Palteth
Roga Danar
Sela
Taibak
Takket x2
Taul x2
Tebok
Toreth
Varel
Vekor x2

Ships:
Decius
Devoras
Haakona
Khazara
Tama

Events:
Thermal Deflector
Red Alert!

The rest is up to you.
Next time a theme deck...

PS:
I did my best start ever with this deck (3 players game):
initial draw:
Taul       (SECURITY)
Dathon     (OFFICER)
Vekor      (SCIENCE/MEDICAL)
Sela       (VIP)
Lakanta    (CIVILIAN)
Haakona
Taul again

Next draw: Vekor again
...
sixth draw: Roga Danar (SECURITY/ENGINEER)

I had seeded a Kurlan under Sensitive Search and no one put any dilemmas
under it, thinking it was a dilemma.

I played Taul,Dathon,Vekor,Sela,Haakona,Lakanta and Roga and got the
Kurlan Naiskos after 7 turns!! And I still had another security and another
medical in my hand! With the Romulans!!

Sorry, I was supposed to post a theme deck but I got so crushed, torn apart
and humiliated by my partner's deck yesterday that I felt I should share with
you my nighmare.

I changed two personnel (after all, it's my post ;-) ) to put a sixth Klingon
only mission (Med Relief)


BeeR's Deck Idea #6: Klingons -Descent part III-

"The Rogue Borgs have made an alliance with the Klingons. They have
reconstructed Lore on a remote planet and are awaiting his return.
Will your crew survive the deadliest threat ever encountered?"

Missions:

Investigate Disturbance
Cloaked Mission
Krios Suppression
Fever Emergency
Brute Force (or Plunder Site)
Medical Relief

Personnel:
Bok
Divok
Etana Jol
Governor Worf
Gowron
J'Ddan
Koroth
Kurn
Nu'Daq
Roga Danar
Vekor

Ships:
Qu'Vat

Interrupts:
Rogue Bors x10
Crosis x2
Q2 x2     (against Amanda)
Amanda x2 (nullifies Hugh)

Events:
Lore Returns
Kivas Fajo x2
The Traveller

Others:
Disruptor OR Varon-T Disruptor OR a Personnel with archaeology if you
   put Plunder Site (possibly a female, Ocett 'caus you have only two)
AU Doorway
Klingon Outpost

Dilemmas:
Interphasic Plasma Creature x4
Male's Love Interest x3   (a lot of SCIENCE are male)
Female's Love Interest x2
Chalnoth
Cardassian Trap
Hunter Gang
Armus
Outpost Raid x2
Tarelian Plague Ship (get rid of Vekor --> SCIENCE)
Frame Of Mind

The idea with the dilemmas is to make one IPC hit (it did not in my case,
I did't had the oportunity to attempt even one mission) by killing or
removing personnel. After that, the Borgs are unstoppable.

a Devidian Door (Lakanta on the Borg Ship? Don't, stop, moving baby...)
an Alternate Universe Doorway
a Federation Outpost (boy, that thing was heavy)

Sector 97                      "Explore Black Cluster"

----------------------------------------------------------

Ohniaka III (Descent) and Wolf 359 are not Fed missions. Too bad.

Much less powerful than Deck #6. This one is more of a theme deck.

For those who find some card inclusions odd, they were taken mainly
from "Q Who?", "TBOBW", "I, Borg", "Descent" and the novel "Vendetta".

        @{b}BeeR's Deck Idea #10@{ub}

Hi everyone! I'm really glad you stopped by because I have something
really nasty for you. This is a deck of total anihilation. In fact, if
the cards get out right, you can make your opponent forfeit after a
few turns. It happened to me (see below). Decks #10 and 11 come from
this memorable deck but are more focused and even more destructive.
Just hope your opponent doesn't play a six space deck...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BeeR's Deck Idea #10: Fed -A Good Place To Die-

Interrupts (10):
Barclay's Transporter Phobia (BTP)x6
Thine Own Self (TOS)x4

Dilemmas (22):
Setups (not stopped):
  Firestorm x2
  Male's Love Interest (MLI)x2
  Female's Love Interest (FLI)
  Armus
  Alien Abduction
  Hunter Gangs x3
  Punishment Zone x2
  Borg Ship
  Frame Of Mind

Hitters:
  Cardassian Trap
  Chalnoth x2
  Nausicaans x2
  Zaldan x2
  Outpost Raid

Other (2):
AU Doorway
Outpost

Personnel, Ships and missions:
Your choice, but Feds suggested. Put 6 planets to be sure he'll have
some planets to try.
Otherwise you could play a 6 Green planets Romulan deck so there will
be less chances that you both play the same affiliation.

Here's what I suggest, it's called Fed -The Fewer the Higher- (12):

J.-L. Picard, Data, Tasha-Alternate, Worf, Roga Danar, Richard Galen,
Vekor, Geordi LaForge, Bev Crusher, Bev Picard, Jo'Bril, Mjr Rakal.

3 different Science, Medical, Engineer, Security and Officer and only
Anthropology, Youth, Mindmeld and Stellar Cartography missing!

The other eight cards are your choice (hey, it's a deck idea, not a
Deck Of The Week! ;-) ). Don't forget to put some ships...
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis:
It's hard to get wrong with this deck. Either you draw a personnel
or you draw something to disable your opponent's personnel.
A typical turn should go like this:

-Your opponent's turn. He attempts a mission with 6 crew members.
-Before he beams down, you put a BTP. 5 to go...
-Hit MLI. 4 to go...
-Hit Armus. 3 to go...
-Chalnoth! Stopped. 2 to go...
-You finish it with TOS. No more crew.

It's important to put as many BTP and TOS as possible because you want
to be able to start this on his first mission attempt.
After two of this, chances are he'll have almost nothing left...

        @{b}BeeR's Deck Idea #11@{ub}

Hi there! Sory for the delay, I had problems with my news servers...
This is, I admit it, a very cheapo deck but it can get you out of
a loosing streak really rapidly. It's not tourney legal
(TAK-Alien Probe) but you can play without the probe.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BeeR's Deck Idea #11: Fed -A Good Day To Die-

Events (9):
Telepathic Alien Kidnappers (TAK) x 4
Alien Probe x2
Anti-Time Anomaly (ATA)
Static Warp Bubble (a Kevin magnet)
Klim Dokachin (another Kevin magnet)

Interrupts (6):
Kevin Uxbridge x2 (to remove the Anti-Time if something goes wrong)
Amanda Rogers x2
Q2 x2

Personnel, Missions and ships (21):
Doesn't really matter, but I recommand the same thing as last week:

Fed -The Fewer the Higher-:
J.-L. Picard, Data, Tasha-Alternate, Worf, Roga Danar, Richard Galen,
Vekor, Geordi LaForge, Bev Crusher, Bev Picard, Jo'Bril, Mjr Rakal.
3 Ships
6 Missions

Dilemmas (22): Same as @{"BDI #10" link DOTW10}:
Setups (not stopped):
  Firestorm x2
  Male's Love Interest (MLI)x2
  Female's Love Interest (FLI)
  Armus
  Alien Abduction
  Hunter Gangs x3
  Punishment Zone x2
  Borg Ship
  Frame Of Mind

Hitters:
  Cardassian Trap
  Chalnoth x2
  Nausicaans x2
  Zaldan x2
  Outpost Raid

Other (2):
AU Doorway
Outpost


Variation: you can remove up to 4 dilemmas if you want more personnel
or artifacts or whatever...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis:
The idea here is that if you draw the ATA early, put down a TAK first
so that your opponent will play his best personnel in a hurry. Then put
the ATA and try to look at your opponent in the eyes without smiling...
:-) (oops! Just did)

If the ATA doesn't come up, put down the Alien Probe and begin a
massive carnage of his hand.

As I said in my previous deck idea, these two decks come from a grand
unified deck that has both this strategy and the BTPhobia-TOSelf
strategy. Once the latter has worked, switch to the former and your
opponent will never be able to put another personnel on the table!

This deck works great with a Klingon Commando (Away Team killer)
instead of a Fed crew. By an extraordinary coincidence, next week's
deck will be a Klingon Commando. Don't miss it...next monday.

        @{b}BeeR's Deck Idea #12@{ub}

Hello to all intelligent lifeforms everywhere!
Here we go again for another of those killer deck that make your
opponent forfeit after a few turns...

This is a deck entirely based on AT battles.
Now you might say: "What? Away Team battles? Helllooo? This is only a
myth you know..."
Well you'll be surprised how nasty that can be.
Just hope (again) your opponent doesn't play an all-space deck.

Card analysis (chess notation):
!! a winner
!  good
?  bad or questionable
?? a looser
?! questionable, but has some possibilities
!? seemed good, but turns out to be bad

Hey! If you try this deck, give me some feedback!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

BeeR's Deck Idea #12: Klingon - DOOM - aka The Glory of Battle

Missions (6):
The 6 Red planets
(Brute Force, Krios Suppression, Cloaked Mission,
Inv. Disturbance, Fever Emergency, Medical Relief)

Personnel (13):
K'mtar
Governor Worf
Kurak
Nu'Daq
Divok
Gowron
Vekma (?!: Honor)
Kurn
Kargan
Divok
Roga Danar
Dathon
Vekor

Ships (3):
Pagh
Hegh'ta
Buruk

Interrupts (16):
Kevin, Amanda, Q2
Dist. of S/T Cont. x2 (is there any abbreviation for this one? DS/TC?)
Phaser Burns
Honor Challenge (!: very good against Romulans)
Klingon Death Yell (?: you'll never die anyway! Just for the theme)
Barclay Transporter Phobia x3 (to start the work...)
Thine Own Self x2 (...to finish off the work)
Disruptor Overload (?!: many uses, ex: Alien Labyrinth)
Rogue Borg x2 (!: to boost the Echo Papa 607)

Equipments (2):
Echo Papa 607
Klingon Disruptor (!: Brute Force, Zaldan, battles...)

Artifacts (2):
Iconian Gateway
Varon-T Disruptor

Others (2):
AU Doorway
Klingon Outpost

Dilemmas (13):
FLI x2
MLI
Q (!: you can put your Gateway-ed Away Teams near your outpost)
Parallel Romance
Matriarchal Society x2
Hunter Gangs
Frame of Mind x2
Alien Labyrinth
Outpost Raid
Punishment Zone
Armus

3 other cards for you to choose (probably personnel or dilemmas)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dilemma combos aim to stop your opponent like FLI+Matriarchal.
Those combos where discussed at large in @{"BDI#10" link DOTW10}. It's not necessary to
put these combos everywhere. Just where your opponent is most likely
to attempt first.
If the cards come out well, this can be a total crusher deck.
Just look what happened to me... (yes, it's again my partner's idea).

11 personnel out. I was testing my deck idea @{"#13" link DOTW13} (Feds).
Attempting the mission at my outpost ("Nah! I'm sure there's no
Outpost Raid here...")
Hit Armus: lose Roga Danar (ouch).
Hit Oupost Raid(!): lose Bev Crusher AND Bev Picard (f..k). Stopped.

Enemy attempts a mission, gets Varon-T.
Enemy goes to my mission, beams AT.
Plays Phaser Burns... no amanda: 2 down, 6 to go...
Enemy battles Emeny 1 more down, 5 to go...
plays Distortion of S/T Continuum... no amanda.
Enemy splits AT: 1)Roga+Gowron+Varon-T 2)the others.
First strike: 4 to go...
Second strike: 3 to go...
One more and he could have played a Thine Own Self!

I lost 8 crew members in one turn. :-(

Having three different way of boosting your ATs (Disruptors, Varon-T
and Echo Papa) increases the chances to have at least one early in
the game.
Another good strategy is to use Brain Drain in combination with such
dilemmas like Holo Ruse or Shaka to stop your oponent.

Guess what? Yep. It'll be next week's theme...

I was trying to find a way to use the Vulcan Stone Of Gul (VSOG) for

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok, first my opinion of the Vulcan Stone Of Gul: not a very good card.
Most of the good personnel can get passed it and you need to stop
your opponent on a planet, wich is somehow difficult.
But then with Brain Drain, it's a whole new ball game.

You can now kill those who normally get passed the VSOG by lowering
their cunning first! I tried it and my opponent was playing Klingons
(low cunning)!! The only two personnel in his (stopped) AT that had
CUNNING > 7 where Dathon and Roga Danar. I played three Brain Drain;
he nullified one with Amanda; I Brain Drained the two wise guys and
then played the VSOG. 8 kills!!

Dedicate four cards in your deck to kill maybe six personnel may not
sound well calculated, but BD has many more uses, like removing a
critical skill (Exo?) to strenghten a dilemma (Zaldan?) or to prevent
your opponent from doing a mission at a critical point...
Almost everyone use Vekor, because of her Med skill. She often
completes the 3 Med Commando that makes Genetronic Replicator so
powerful. Well your opponent might be on for a little surprise...
You might want to look at it's effect on Nutational Shields, Warp Core
Breach, The Charybdis abd Isabella.

Also Parallel Romance is excellent for the VSOG since it stops two
personnel that might be VSOGed after!
                      ++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Next week: a tribute to the Major, one of my favorite cards.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, now for the analysis:

You might wonder why doing such a deck in a race game like STCCG.
Granted it isn't a speed deck, but if the cards come out well, your
opponent will be in for a surprise...You don't _need_ the Espionnage!

First of all you've placed the dilemmas under the Fed Missions, so you
know exactly what to expect (do you?). Nothing new here. The difference
is that since this deck relies heavily on NA personnel, you can do
_all_ your opponent's missions. The old trick of placing a single
dilemma and two or three misseeded dilemmas works really well here.

But this deck really shines in those lazy Sunday afternoon games when
you play without the 100 points limit (i.e. until someone's deck runs
out). In those games, you can easily do 5 or even your 6 missions
before you finish your deck. So one mission less for your opponent
can be fatal, and since you're playing Romulan there's no way for him
to steal your missions.

Unless...
...next week.

Ok, now for the analysis:

Since this deck resembles last week's deck, most of what I said is still
true. One thing I didn't said last week: the Med Kit is useful only if
you don't remember where you put what and against the Plague Ship (tough
I would suggest you put the Plague Ship somewhere you're not likely to
spy. I've also included Lore's Fingernail but I didn't playtested the
deck with it, I prefered to add another dilemma.
Only one Security in the Commando isn't a problem if you remember the
dilemmas.

Want some stats? 30 Classifications with 19 personnels!
Diplo x8, Lead x7, Hon x6, Comp x6, Trea x5,
Nav x4, Bio x4, Astro x4, Greed x4, Exo x3,
Arch, Phy and Music x2, Anth, Emp, Stel, Geo and Tal Shiar x1

Woah! Even if you don't spy any Rom mission, you'lL bulldoze your way
through anything. And there's three Fed missions you can do with one
personnel. Sounds like the much overdue Fed -One Man Show-...

Think the decks are getting a bit tight these days?
Ok, next week will be a theme deck.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This deck was very interesting to play, as it permitted me to try cards
I never tried before. With Howard Heirloom Candle, you can actually make
Anaphasic Organism and Empathic Echo work by doubling the requirement
for those two dilemmas. Now before you tell me that the card reads
"doubles the effect" and that effect isn't the same as requirement,
read the FAQ carefully. It clearly says that the card doubles the
requirement, NOT the effect. That's probably the oddest ruling in the
entire game but the FAQ is the law so...
Receptacle Stones can have very interesting effects too. Since it is
written "...also apply to..." we decided that the dilemma would affect
your opponent after. So if you hit Q, you would be the last to modify
the spaceline! Correct me if I'm wrong Q(!). Also, you'll be able to
capture someone right when you want! Just hit Cardi Trap. Chances are
your opponent won't have Empathy.
The combo Brain Drain-Ktarian Game is also very good since your opponent
loses two crew members before the 30 Cunning is calculated.
Vulcan Nerve Pinch? Oh well, I guess you can remove that card for now
in favor of a Nagilum maybe, to justify the Yamato...

Next week, how about a game of Black Jack?

        @{b}BeeR's Deck Idea #17@{ub}

'lo there!

Recently, some people complained that the decks me and the others were
posting contained too much high-priced rares.
Well, when I see a new deck design, I never try it before analysing it
myself and making a few adjustment if I feel necessary. For example, I
almost never put The Traveller in my deck designs simply because we
don't play with it. We feel it's too powerful so we just don't use it.
If your partner always play with it, I suggest you remove one dilemma
in favour of that card. Also, if you don't have Picard, you can replace
him with two other characters with the same skills... you get the idea.

This deck was designed back in June so it may seems a little out
of touch (I saw a few Music-Ressikan Flute deck designs since).
Anyway, here it is...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BeeR's Deck Idea #17: Fed - Points'R'us -

Personnel (16):
Mickey D. x2
Data
Jenna D'Sora
Jean-Luc Picard
Beverly Picard
Neela Daren
Ian Andrew Toi
Jack Crusher
Beverly Crusher
Roga Danar
Vekor
Worf
Thomas Riker

Ships (4):

Interrupts (9):
Emergency Transporter Armband (ETA) x4 (!: beam me up, Scotty)
Amanda Rogers x2 (against Thine Own Self)
Q2 x2 (to protect your ETAs and the Ressikan Flute)
Kevin Uxbridge

Events (2):
Red Alert!
The Traveller (!: really important in this case because of Music)

Others (4):
Fed outpost
AU Doorway
Engineering Kit
Ressikan Flute (RF)

Missions (6):
Diplomacy Mission
Excavation
Restore Errant Moon
Avert Disaster
Evaluate Terraforming
Investigate Massacre

Dilemmas (19):
Royale Casino: Blackjack (BJ)x6
The Higher...The Fewer x2
Punishment Zone x4 (*Four*. Ouch!)
Edo Probe x2
Sarjenka
Holographic Ruse
Q
Worshiper
Alien Labyrinth

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You've probably guess, the idea is to put the six BJ dilemmas under
you own missions. You'll be able to gain as much as a 60 point lead
over your opponent (30:-30). After that, the RF takes charge with up to
40 points plus the mission where you seeded RF (about 30 points).
Speaking of Blackjack, I'm really looking forward to the Royal
Casino: ____ side games coming (probably) in the next expansion.

How do you attempt those six missions without losing Mickey D.? Chances
are you'll have a couple of missions with BJ as your first encounter.
In that case your ETAs and Q2s are all you need to beams safely up once
the job is done. Sarjenka will also come in handy to stop Mickey.
Once you've used all your ETAs, start doing the missions with Mickey as
a crew member, backed with another one in your hand.

The Edo Probe-Q and Edo Probe-Worshiper combos are almost sure hitter,
as most people will choose to continue...

One big weakness in this deck: only 12 dilemmas. Normally I would
scream against this, but in that case each time you succede a BJ, it's
as if your opponent had hit a -10 dilemma. Hopefully you'll be able to
make 100 points before your will-be fast opponent.

Oh, and one more thing: try not to send Vekor and Thomas Riker together
in an Away Team as they are the only two that can solve Evaluate
Terraforming. I know what I'm talking about. ;-)

Next week: Rommies go in space.

   Zaldan
   Alien Parasites

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple, straightforward, no fuss, no mess. Thise is probably the most
boring deck I've ever written (except maybe @{"#2" link DOTW2})...

First you put the three Green Space. Here's how to do Quash Conspiracy:
wait 'till the Major and hopefully the Pi come out, attempt the mission
with one well staffed ship while the Major in her Pi is waiting _at_the
mission_opposite_to_the_direction_a_Borg_Ship_would_follow_ (I know, I
made the mistake).
Next there is Explore Typhone Expanse, with Klingons having no good
Stellar Cartographers and poor Cunning; Secret Salvage, where you should
beat the Klingons again with 7 Treachery, 4 Computer Skill and 3
Navigation in your deck; And finally Compromised Mission with 2
Treachery that a Fed opponent will have trouble getting out before you.

Palteth? Tomek? Tarus? Jera?! Sounds like a deck from my early days...
I had to blow the thick layer of dust from those cards ;-) since I don't
usually play Romulans in space.
Palteth is good for is ENGINEER classification and the fourth Computer
Skill he brings, which important.
With Mendak around, now's a good time to put Captain's Log, or you could
put a second Holo-Projector or Hugh to be on the safe side, but there is
a reason why I included 22 dilemmas...


With a deck design so dull, now's the best time to draw you attention to
the second, but no less important, part of a deck design: the dilemmas.

You all know, dilemmas are good when they are combined. Those combos are
even better when arranged in a way that will prevent your opponent from
withdrawing after an unpleasant encounter.

Keeping this in mind, I chose my dilemmas in a way that would allow me
to put two dilemma under each missions in the case of a six space and
three dilemmas under each planet in the opposite situation. That brings
me to a 4 space, 8 either and 10 planets setup. I then chose those
dilemmas trying to have a basher-stopper combo for each space and
a basher-basher-stopper combo for each planet. If you opponent decides
to mix space and planet missions, things get even better...
So I'm leaving you to your thoughts, trying to find the best setup for
each possibilities.

Next week, let's investigate some space anomalies...

limit sometimes)

10 others. Space/Planet dilemmas preferably.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This deck is a mixing of several space-oriented theme decks with
about the same personnel, notably a Wormhole x10 one (very effective
against Klingon attack decks), a Q-Nets one (my opponent played a Fed
Diplo deck :-( ), a Warp Rift-Gaps Tetryon-Gaps heavy deck (these
combos are very effective: place one combo on each side of the outpost
and move away your missions using Q...) and a space defensive deck
(Hugh, Senior Staff, Asteroid Sanctuary...). Try them, they are very
fun to play, especially the wormhole heavy one if you have at least 8
of them.

I like playing six spaces. I will probably end up nullifying 8 to 10
dilemmas just by doing so. Watch out for the multi affiliation missions,
you opponent will often put one or no space dilemma, followed by tons
of misseeded ones to scare you out. It's even more obvious when he
places his outpost near that mission.

Only two wormholes is dangerous, but the deck don't rely on these two
cards, so they can show up late in the game.
The Q-Net might poses a problem for your ships, so use one AU Doorway.

Distortion of S/T Continuum: simply one of the most usefull cards of
the game. Good for battle decks, speed decks, theme decks, defensive
decks...

Next week: Diplomatic Conference (and how to win with it).

'lo there!

This week we have a guest!

Let me introduce you to my usual opponent, the guy (with Dom also)
who dragged me into the CCG world (who "drowned" me may be more
appropriate... thanks guys ;-) ).
His name is Phil, but you'll probably see him as Koroth, and I as Tebok
on Decipher's WebBoard.

-Hi Phil!
-Helloww.

Phil is an old contributer to this column. He designed decks @{"#4" link DOTW4} and @{"12" link DOTW12}
an contributed to decks @{"#10" link DOTW10} and @{"#11" link DOTW11} (yes, I know those are the four best
deck designs I've ever posted). He's gonna be with us this fall, as I
persuated him to join the net (that's for dragging me to "another" money
pit ;-) ).

Now that presentations are made, let Phil talk to you about his latest
idea, shall I say the first "Tebok & Koroth's Deck of the Week"...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BeeR's Deck Idea #20: Fed - The Conference -

Missions (6):
Diplomatic Conference
Hunt for DNA
Investigate Massacre
Evaluate Terraforming
Evacuation
Diplomacy Mission

Personnel (17):
Major Rakal
Governor Worf
Maques
Sarek
Tasha Yar-Alternate
Jack Crusher
Beverly Picard
Jean-Luc Picard
Beverly Crusher
Dr. Selar
Richard Galen
Data
Dathon
Lakanta
Dr. Reyga
Baran
Roga Danar

Ships (3):
Future Enterprise
U.S.S. Enterprise
U.S.S. Galaxy

Interrupts (7):
Q2 X2
Amanda Rogers
Kevin Uxbridge X2
Dist. Time/Space Cont.
Vulcan Mindmeld

Events (1):
Res-Q

Others (6):
Federation Outpost
A. U. Doorway
Devidian Door X2
Ophidian Cane
Betazoid Gift Box

Dilemmas (20):

(he didn't put any, check deck @{"#19" link DOTW19} for a good selection)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This deck is very simple: four easy missions to get your artifacts and
*two* big scorers to split your opponent's big dilemmas.

1)Use the BGBox to get the necessary VIPs in your hand and the
Ophidian Cane (if necessary) to bring them together to the Diplomatic
Conference once your AT has cleared the dilemmas. You should try to keep
Rakal, Worf and Maques in your hand and play them with the cane to
protect them from any danger. Should you decide to use Rakal or Maques
in your AT, you still have a Res-Q just in case.

2)The DNA Hunt can be easily accomplished once you use Vulcan Mindmeld
to duplicate important skills (Sarek mindmelds Galen and Selar mindmelds
Roga or Jack Crusher or JL Picard).

A heavy defense (Q2, Kevin) is necessary to protect your important cards
(Mindmeld, Dev Door, Cane).


Next week: who said Romulans were traitors?

'lo there!

Now that the new ST card game is up and running, I've decided to change
my weekly deck title to avoid any confusion in the newsgroup.
BeeR's STCCG Deck Idea sounded good, but here's another idea more in
the net.tradition:

Tebok's STCCG DOTW!

And what could be more appropriate to this new name than a Romulan
theme deck...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tebok's STCCG Deck of the Week #21: Romulan - A Matter of Honor -

Missions (6):
Secret Salvage
Investigate Massacre
Investigate Raid
Relief Mission
Excavation

Barclay's Protomorphosis Disease
Frame of Mind

Q

----------------------------------------------------------------------

That new D'Tan card gave my Romulans an all new purpose in life: to
live with honor and a sense of integrity. So I grabbed my cards and
looked for all those who could pass The Great Test with the help of our
little Romulan friend. A few people from the yellow world came to join
them and they even admitted a misfit for medical and science reason.

What's great about this deck is that with the help of Lower Decks, your
personnel have an average integrity of 6.6! Not bad for Romulans.
Using Dathon and Maques, I was even able to pass the Q dilemma with
eight personnel! My Q dilemma! With only one space mission, I was sure
to attract a lot of nasty dilemmas there (why waste them?) so I seeded
Q there last and did the mission first. Then I went to the more
hazarous planet missions and got destroyed on my way by a Klingon
armada but that's another story...

Another note: with 10 officers out of 18 personnel, the two kits are
quite powerful. The rest is obvious.

Next week:
    The wise Koroth has spoken again: some Klingons are honorless.

'lo there!

Here's another deck from my friend Koroth.
I wonder where he got the inspiration...

BEGIN TRANSMISSION
RECEIVING FROM: Koroth@Monastery.Boreth

Honorless Klingons outmatch honest Rommies anytime... Nice try Tebok.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tebok's STCCG Deck of the Week #22: Klingon - Right of Cowardice -

Dilemmas (19):

Borg Ship-Tarellian Plague Ship-Cytherians
Frame of Mind-Outpost Raid-Cardassian Trap
Parallel Romance-Hunter Gangs-The Gatherers-Barclay's PD
Tarellian Plague Ship-Rascals-Nagilum
        (the ONLY way I ever witnessed Nagilum kill anyone)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

At first glimpse, an honorless Klingon is as sorry an excuse for a
living entity as a fishless sea. So I thought that since we're probably
going to end up soon with the later, might as well get used to the idea
by fumblimg with the former...

                And remenber, "The wind does not respect a fool"

                        Honorably yours, Koroth

END TRANSMISSION

Wow. That was deep. I admit there's not much to say about this deck.
Every card speaks for itself. You forgot to include Kell, though
(but that was probably intentional).

That about wraps it up for now. See you all next week!

Enough about theme decks for now, let's investigate something I

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

One good thing about mixing these two affiliations together is that
they are complementary in many ways. Rommies tend to be stronger
whereas Feds tend to have higher integrity. Roms have more treachery
and Feds have more honor, etc.
The first mission set you can built is the obvious one, the diplo set.
Start with Investigate Massacre, add Diplomacy Mission, Evacuation and
Covert Rescue and finally, take Excavation plus another one.
Skills: Diplomacy, Leadership and probably Treachery. That's it!
The one problem with this idea is that you'll need a *lot* of officers
and you know how much this classification is useful...

So let's look at the space missions. Romulan have two missions
perfectly suited for the Feds: Lonka Pulsar and Shattered Space.
After including the Astrophysicians, the Stellar Cartographers and a
couple of support crew, you end up having enough skills to complete
most of the Fed and Romulan missions. Look like a simplified version
of my two espionnage decks!
One major diference: A third of your crew are Engineers and a quarter
are Sciences. That will help you get passed a couple of space dilemmas
easily.

The only problem I had with this deck is that it's very low in
offensive interrupts. A Temporal Rift and a Thine Own Self would have
been very useful in more than one occasions. But then again a lot of
personnel is also powerful and I won't go below 18 dilemmas so I
decided to post it without any modifications.

Dilemmas (18): (recommended combos, if possible)
Armus - Frame of Mind - Ferengi Attack
Parallel Romance - Male's Love Interest - Chalnoth
The Higher... - Frame of Mind - Q
Interphasic Plasma Creatures- Outpost Raid - Borg Ship
Firestorm - Hunter Gangs - Zaldan
Edo Probe - Cardassian Trap - Shaka

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Who said treaties were peaceful in nature?
Actually, nothing quite stirs away the boredom of diplomatic agreements
like pouring a little chaos into your neighbor's lives! With enough
Klingon/Non-Aligned personnel to man 4 warships (3 of them under
captain's log), and a few battle interrupts, you just might achieve
exactly that... But most of all, even if your intentions might not be,
your hand is ENTIRELY honorable!

This, however, brings forth a few problems: no Bio (not so bad for
planet missions), no Exo (counter Zaldan with Disruptor),
no Anthropology (try to avoid religious centers...), only 1 Science
(keep an eye open for those freak leaches, and hope you don't tear apart
the flat once you're protomorphosized...), no empathy (bah, F*** Tam!),
and only 1 Engineer (unless you carry around Scotty, but I guess he's
seen enough already...).

By the way, if you manage to beam down the Kargan/Riker/Vekma trio from
the Pagh, and to match the Riker/Vekma duo in a Parallel Romance, score
44 points (just 1 shy of the Borg Ship)!...

        And remember, "The wind does not respect a fool"

                       Honorably yours, Koroth
                        ++++++++++++++++++++

Not bad he? Thanks again Koroth. Stay tuned for upcoming deck ideas by
Tania Taylor, Robbie Clark alias Mortal Q and Peter Veeren alias Ian
Christopher Troi.

        @{b}Tebok's Deck of the Week #25@{ub}

Jolan tru! Welcome to the 25th edition of Tebok's DOTW.

25? Sounds like a magic number to me!
What could be appropriate to such a number? 25 decks you won't see in
DOTW? Nah. Been done. How about...
...25 short deck ideas? That's not bad... I have tons of unfinished
deck ideas that are to "ordinary" for a DOTW. I was waiting for QC to
get a couple of missions that could fit in the themes, but I guess we'll
have to wait another six months for that.

So, here are 25 short deck ideas to give you a head start, and a quick
step by step guide to built an effective deck with those ideas:

1) Select a mission set. The best are those with few skill requirements.
2) Choose your personnel to match the required skills. Try to have at
   least three personnel for each required skill, more if required more
   than once.
3) Adjust your crew to have at least 3 different SEC, MED, SCI and ENG.
4) Watch out for Exo and Empathy.
5) Interrupts, Events, Artifacts.
6) Dilemmas. At least 18. 9 planet, 9 either and 3 space ideally.

If you can come up with good decks based on these ideas, I'll be
delighted to read them.

The Missions:

I got all the Romulan only planet missions I have. This will keep your
opponent from doing your missions and get rid of almost half their
dilemmas.

[Iconia Investigation would also fit nicely here istead of Plunder Site,
it's Romulan only and you got enough Computer Skill to do it. -Tebok]

The Personnel:
Lakanta is here just so you can get to those unlucky people who were
sent off to the far off planets. Amarie is in just to get past any
dilemmas that need Music (SINCE NO ROMMIES HAVE MUSIC!)

[It is possible to get around those dilemmas without Music, though.]

The Ships:
These are the best that the Romulans have and 2 of them get Captain's
Log benefits.

[The Decius is difficult to staff here, the Devoras is easier, if you
have it. You could then replace Amarie with Mendak for another CL.]

The Dilemma Groups:
These are based on divide and conquer.This is the best way to have a
good Away team/Space fight deck.Then there are the Male and Female
Love Interest's these are the divide and conquer cards. Then we have
Hunter Gangs for fun!

[Divide & Conquer! I like that terminology! Most definetely the best
way to build effective combos.]

The Events:
These slow your opponent down and power you up.

The Interrupts:
The TR's are to give you a while longer to get to those stranded folks.
The Barclay TP's are to see your opponents face contort when Jean-Luc
is too scared to beam down. DS/TC is for attack then kill strategy.

[Barclay TP with Tarellian Plague Ship is also a very good combo]

Jolan tru!

I got a few requests lately from readers who wanted a deck with few or
no rares. So I designed a deck with only commons and uncommons and went
to playtest it against my usual opponent... only to discover that his
deck had very few rares too!

This was a great opportunity to post a Two Player Game before Decipher,
that could pretty easily be reproduced by anyone who wants to introduce
someone to STCCG.

The Romulan deck is based around Lower Decks, since almost half of the
personnel can benefit from it. D'Tan also adds to the total Integrity
and with four Medical and a Genetronic Replicator, you end up pretty
safe in every situation.

Overall, the Klingon deck doesn't look very good, I had to change my
opponent's missions, which were a six space, and add more personnel to
replace the big ones (Kurn, Gov Worf, Kurak...). That's why I would
suggest playing it and let your opponent have the Rommie deck. Or you
could play the Rommie deck against a normal deck and after you've won,
look your opponent straight in the eyes and say: "You see, I don't even
need rares to beat you!"

This deck presents a different way of accomplishing Diplomatic
Conference than DOTW#20: instead of the Devidian Door, it uses the
Iconian Gateway to safely bring your valuable VIPs to the Conference.
The good variety of classification in this deck makes it a perfect
choice for the second artifact, the Kurlan Naiskos.

Like many decks that relies on difficult missions, howerver, this
deck needs a lucky draw or maybe a BG Box to get, in this case, the
Fed and the NA VIP early in the game. Unfortunately, these two are
the only empaths of the deck: you need them so they're likely to get
killed. That's why a Res-Q is very important.

Equally important is Palor Toff, in case your Treaty is destroyed,
An even safer idea is to put two Treaty cards, but then you loose
the versatility of PT, that can retreive many other useful cards.

That reminded me of a way to bust the game (and your opponent's
patience). First, load your deck of Palor Toffs. When you lead in
the points, simply use a Palor Toff to retreive another Palor Toff
from your discard pile, and repeat the procedure until your opponent
decides to withdraw from the game to get home! You lost a friend,
but you won the game!!!
                        ++++++++++++++++++++

To quote Heather Scott of the long defunct Heather's STCCG DOTW:
"Keep those decks coming in!  Your deck could be next!"
Please don't forget to put some comments, a deck is as good as
people know how to use it.

Jolan tru!

I wanted to wait DOTW#30 for the first QC deck but after tonight's game,
I can't think of anything else than QC. QC! QC!

So tonight was our first showdown of QC decks. I decided to play a
Klingon battle deck because I knew that my opponent could not resist
the call the K'chiQs... and won!

But, being a fair player, I have to recognise that Koroth's deck was
better designed than mine, so I'm going to post his deck instead, with
both my and his comments about some cards.

So here goes the first QC DOTW...

Tebok's Comments:

Personnel:

K'chiQ: this card is incredible! You need an Empath? You got it!
Oh you're playing Klingon and don't have enough Stellar Cartography?
Tada! You lost your only Anthropologist? Tada! Your opponent's K'chiQ
has a valuable skill and he just hit The Naked Truth? Put one more!

Mortal Q: this is the big absent of this deck and the reason I won the
game. Not because he didn't have one in his deck, but because I was able
to report mine using The Naked Truth. And since he couldn't get his
Immortal Again ["wich, by the way, I didn't have" -Koroth], I didn't had
to face the numerous Q-Flash I encounted...

Dilemmas:

Yuta: ouch! Both of us encoutered a Yuta and we both lost Galen!
With a Yuta number of 7, we could kill Galen, Gov. Worf, Kitrik...

Koroth's Comments:

        The 6 trios answer perfectly to an all-planet strategy & can take into
account without a budge 2 space missions. And even in a case where the
slimy opponent chooses 6 space missions (as Tebok did), you can
leasurely re-arrange the dilemmas & Q-Flashes to cover them all fairly
well.

        The Q-Continuum side-deck (and a part of the crew rowster) is focused
on capturing foes (call it sort of a Q-net...) The Mandarin Bailiff/High
Sheriff combo is the heart of it all: capture one, show a security
('cause you have enough to keep one in your hand at all time), capture
two more (whom you can brainwash or interrogate under Cardassian
supervision, at your discretion).

                        And remember, "The wind does not respect a fool"

                                Honorably yours,
                                                Koroth

This week I have a very cool (5pts) deck for you! It is so cool
(5pts) that I even thought of not posting it and using it at the next
tournament in my region.

And what's *very* cool (5pts!) about this deck is that it's
relatively easy to build and I can only find one way to beat it: to
play the exact same deck!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you still trying to find a weakness? We did.
We did *try*, that is.

First, It has Q's seal of approval. It is Legal. For now.
Second, before you ask the question: no, you don't *have* to play an
affiliation. The rule book says on p.6:
"... you must have:
*...
*one Outpost card for each affiliation you decide to control."

So you don't HAVE to control an affiliation. If, however, that ruling
is ever changed, put a Romulan Outpost (so that you can say you won
a tourney with a Romulan deck) and play with only 22 dilemmas...
If you have to include at least one personnel, then my friend Koroth
suggests that you put a Klingon Outpost and K'chiQ (the coolest card
in STCCG). She will of course instantly die the second you report
her (cool!).

Example for a first turn:
In your initial 7 cards, you have 6 PAs and 1 Kivas.
Play Kivas, draw 2 other PAs and 1 Kivas.
Play 7 PAs. Your opponent will surely start an argument: put another
PA, play Kivas for free.
Draw 3 PAs, play them all.
Draw your end-of-turn card (another PA) play it. After all, that
turn was pretty cool. :-)

One turn, 55 points. That's what I call a speed deck.
Now you have only 16 cards left in your draw deck. With a Traveller
coming in about 3 turns and two other Kivas, that means your
opponent has less than 10 turns to make 100 points, with 12 space
missions and 23 dilemmas to slow him/her down!


Let's put this deck to the test even more.

1) Telepathic Alien Kidnappers: Nope. PA are interrupts so you can
   play them as soon as you draw them. You will most probably loose
   your events, but if you can put down a Kivas and draw a Traveller
   along with your PAs, just start an argumentation, play the Traveller
   for free and start draining your deck at double speed.

2) Amanda, Res-Q, Palor Toff, Immortal Again, Plexing, Subspace
   Schism: unless your opponent has LOT'S of those cards, you are safe
   here. Remember, even if you loose 5 PA and can only score 95 points,
   chances are you will exhaust you draw deck way before your opponent.

3) Q's Planet (from opponent's Q's Tent): Same as 2).

4) Revolving Door: your Q-Continuum is closed. Don't worry, you still
   have 3 dilemma combos everywhere.

5) What're You Tryin' To Push On Us?: Oops! Wrong game. Would've been
   very annoying though.

6) Kevin: OK, so you loose a Traveller. Put another one.

7) Parallax Arguers: ah! That can hurt. Your opponent might even win
   if he/she has enough PAs to counter you 10 times. But who's gonna
   play with 10 PAs? Another DOTW reader maybe? :-)

@Node PARALAX "STCCG.guide/ST:CCG Deck of the Week/Parallax Arguers"
@TOC "STCCG:dotw.guide/DOTW"

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}ST:CCG Deck of the Week@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

The card works because it forces your opponent to choose the lesser of
two evils: (1) deem the action "cool" and give you 5 points, or (2) argue
with you and give you a "free" Event play.  The secret to successful use
of the card is to play it at a time that creates maximum anxiety for
your opponent as to which Event cards you might be holding.  Examples:

1. Opponent moves a ship to the location of your ship, and it's pretty
obvious to you that she plans to attack.  Play Parallax Arguers.  You
get a quick 5 points unless she wants to risk a Bynars Weapon Enhancement
or Metaphasic Shields coming out before her battle is initiated.

2. Your opponent has a lot of ships and personnel at her outpost. You
play your Tox Uthat, say "now THAT was cool" and drop a Parallax Arguers.
Your opponent will probably give you the 5 points, rather than risk your
Supernova going boom before she can scatter her ships away from her
outpost.

These examples are admittedly very specific, but I think they show how
the Parallax Arguers can have great psychological value if played at the
right time.  8-)  Here are some situtations in which you would hope the
card *doesn't* work (that is, you hope she argues, thus giving you the
free Event play):

1. Ever wish you could play Kivas Fajo as an interrupt?

2. Ever want to play a Warp Core Breach *and* a motion-hampering Event
card both before the end of your opponent's next turn?

3. Suppose she just resolved a dilemma and you remember that the next
one you seeded there is a Thought Fire.  I'd say now's a great time to
generously play your Traveller next to her draw deck.

4. I'm sure people will find many additional reasons to play Event cards
during their opponent's turn. How about the Neural Servo Device? I use
your non-aligned ship during *your* turn -- oops, I attacked one of
your other ships.  Oops again, I got them both "stopped" for you!
Clumsy me....  ;-)

Jolan tru!

This week, I'm gonna post something nice and easy. :-)
Why? For those who read this on the newsgroup, let's say that last
week's deck was, well, just a little of the track...
Bottom line: it does not work. See the upcoming FAQ (or the dotw web
site) for more infos. Next week, Tebok strikes back. :-)

Do you play with decks bigger than 60 cards? That one's for you.
It's Tania Taylor's super-duper-mumbo-jombo 120 cards deck, to use
in a 150 to 200 points game. Very reliable, and the duplication
allows you to use it in a 90 or 80 cards game too! It's a non-QC deck.

Dilemmas for Space missions (18):

Outpost Raid                    Hopefully this works, then play the
Quantum Singularity Lifeforms   Ded In Bed cards to kill one or more
Borg Ship                       crew members in stasis.

Rascals                         Rascals makes some crew STR 2. IPC-2.
Interphasic Plasma Creatures    Therefore some crew will have STR 0.
Outpost Raid                    Then try to get past Outpost Raid. :)

Interphasic Plasma Creatures
Tsiolkovsky Infection
Nagilum

Radioactive Garbage Scow
Nanites
Cosmic String Fragment

Menthar Booby Trap
Microbiotic Colony
Coalescent Organism

Edo Probe
Empathic Echo
Frame Of Mind
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It's not a savage deck but if you play carefully it can be fairly
leathal. You have to seed it just right and focus on the game. It's
not one of those 'shoot 'em up' decks, either. Typical federation
deck, I suppose.
                        ++++++++++++++++++++
Lot's of different missions and personnel, this deck can do anything,
depending on which cards get out first. Less than one third of your
draw deck consists of personnel, but you have two Kivas and a cryosat
to help you. A BG Box would be very useful here.

Parallel Romance + Q-Flash + Outpost Raid

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we are (here we are *again*)! That one's a little more difficult
to built (12 Kivas) and will give two choices to your opponent...

The Not Cool Variation: the guy doesn't get it. Each time he doesn't
agree you play a Kivas. After a couple of this, it is useless to
agree on subsequent PAs because your draw deck will be very depleted
and you will score 5 points each time. Worst scenario for your
opponent. You can even exhaust your deck in two turns (play Samuel
on the last but one turn, show Devidian Door, score 10 points for
Samuel and draw your last card). If your not lucky and don't draw
any Kivas at first, this may extend to 5-6 turns. Don't fear Masaka
because you will have only one card left in your draw deck (you will
re-draw all your cards except for one, chances are it won't be your
Devidian Door).

The Cool Variation: the guy is Cunning > 6. If all your PAs are cool,
you will only be able to put one Kivas per turn. You will still draw
4 cards per turn, though. This will give your opponent about 8 turns
(a few Uxbridged Kivas) to score 60 points (worst case scenario: your
last four cards are PAs). Bottom line: your opponent needs to
complete two missions in 8 turns, with 21 dilemmas seeded under his
missions.

In Between: not a very good idea.

Decks/Cards to watch:
Wesley's Anti-DOTW30 deck. Although this deck will demolish my deck,
it is not viable against anything else.
Revolving Door (in a Q's Tent): could be dangerous against the
"Not Cool" variation (you won't be able to play Samuel) but your
opponent needs to retreive it on his first turn (assuming he starts
to play first) or he won't be able to stop you. Worst case will be a
draw anyway.


Pronostic: this deck will win 75% of the games if your opponent is
unprepared. Not bad...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The missions:
Five standard green planets and the big scorer. You could also trade
one of the green missions for Kithomer Research. Although the
Klingons will be able to do it, someone playing Romulan probably won't
so he'll place a couple of nasty dilemmas he desn't want to encounter
himself.

The personnel:
Not many. You will need your Q's Tents. If you're lucky and draw all
the VIPs, you will only need to retreive Major Rakal from your Q's
Tent.

The ships:
Only two! You will not need to move early in the game so that will
not be a problem... unless your opponent gets a really lucky starting
hand.

The Interrupts and Events:
The combo Parallax Arguers-Drought Three is very cool!
After you've completed Diplomatic Conference, play a DT for 7 points,
then play a PA. What will it be? 5 pts or a possible second DT for
7 pts? That's what I call a dilemma!

The other draw cards:
Four Q's Tent should be enough to retreive the replacement VIPs for
those in the bottom of your draw deck and maybe an arbiter of
succession for ten extra points if you have both Gowron and Governor
Worf in play.
And then there's the hick: three Devidian Door!
Those of you lucky enough (but not as lucky as Koroth) to have two
of those will have to remove the one in your Q's Tent and forget
about Arbiter of Succession... unless you put a couple of Trust Me
in your Q-Continuum and one of two Palor Toffs in your deck.
If you have only one DDoor... well... replace 'couple' with 'lots'
in the last sentence. :-)

The Q-Continuum:
Lemon-Aid: because you probably won't be the first to score. :-)

The Dilemmas:
Barclay and Microvirus to seed under the Conference for an
additionnal 15 points!

Let's do some maths:
Barclay:         10
Microvirus:       5
Dip. Conference: 60
Drought Three:    7
Parallax Arguers: 5 could be another Drought Three
Another one:      5 idem
Arb. of Succ.:   10
Total:          102

Be careful when defending your Drought Threes: your VIPs cannot work
together after the completion of the mission.

Hteij!

On november 28th, a day after the miraculous Decipher announcement,
another big event took place on the Internet, but this time on
Jonathan's Chat Page <http://www.geocities.com/Area51/6850/chat.html>.

That event was "Clash of the Titans", the 'net game between myself and
Wesley Crusher. OK, I know this title sounds presumptuous but you don't
get people's interest with "Confrontation of two ordinary guys"... ;-)

After a whopping 3h30 of play, Wesley came on top 100-35. He was never
in real danger, having taken a 65-0 lead before I was able to threaten
him ($#"%?@ Klim Dokachin).

So, without any further delay, here's the winning deck...

Lemon-Aid x2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I will dare to comment on this deck, but since I lost against it don't
take what I say for granted...

The missions:
6 green planets. Classic, effective. Romulans are probably the best
affiliation for a 6 planet since most requirements are alike.

The personnel:
Just enough duplication to easily accomplish the missions and overcome
the dilemmas. The Medical Kit helps to have enough MEDICAL.
65% Non-aligned is a bit high, though.

The Tent:
Definetely an offensive Tent with all the SWB, Klim, Espionages, etc.
Having an offensive Tent means that you need enough Tents in your draw
deck to (almost) always have one in your hand when needed. 4 is just
enough and a Kivas in your draw deck should enable you to catch up for
those turns without any draw. Also you want to be prepared against a
similar deck, hence a Kevin in reserve.


Next week, my deck...

Hello everyone!

You've all been waiting for this: the deck I used for Clash of the
Titans. Here it is! Of course, I didn't play Romulans. I suspected that
Wesley had a feeling I would go for my favorite affiliation, so I
played Klingons instead. I estimated a 50% chance Wes would go for
Klingons too. It's a shame I was wrong, I would've liked to see some
good battles. Anyway...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This deck is a mission solver with enough ships to give a good battle
to anyone.

The missions:
Plunder Site was a mistake. I should've put Brute Force even if it
would've been very difficult to attempt. I was forced to break one of
my combos to prevent an easy 30 points for Wes.

The Dilemmas:
17 was a mistake! I should've put 18. Why? Because in the case of a 6
planet, a third card in the Borg-Outpost Raid combo could've made a big
difference. When Wes encountered it, he had 19 Strenght!!
3 is the name of the game. Period. Another example: you should always
triple any skill required by one of your missions.

The draw deck:
One big absent: Red Alert! I can't believe I forgot to put one. At
least it should be in Q's Tent.

The Q-Continuum:
I really like Scottish Setter. Before a Security Precaution it can
remove a much needed SECURITY and before IP Creatures it's a good way
to remove a SCIENCE.
Mandarin Bailif is always an annoyer. It's almost like a free 'The
Higher... The Fewer'.

Q's Tent:
A defensive Tent...
Alien Parasite in case your opponent uses a Q's Planet.
Arbiter of Succession for a quick 10 points if you have 90 points.
Kevin Uxbridge against an annoyer like Klim Dokachin.
Madred in case you need quickly get passed Security Precautions.
Dr. Reyga if you want to attempt your opponent's space missions.
Soong-Type Android in case you loose a vital classification.
Klingon Outpost. Just in case. :-)
The Traveler to nullify SWB, otherwise wait for the draw deck one.
Masaka Transformation, against Devidian Door and Kurlan Naiskos
Yellow Alert against an early Red Alert!
Maques, to cure Frame of Mind with Devinoni Ral
Revolving Door, to shut off the Q-Continuum at a critical moment.
The Devil, against Horga'hn (and Treaties sometimes).

Since it was a defensive Tent, I only had three Q's Tents in my draw
deck. When I ran out of Tents with a Klim Dokachin still affecting me,
I wish I had put one more. 4 seems to be the ideal number in this case.

That about wraps it up folks!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In CCGs, where the name of the game is the draw, the first thing a good
deck should try to do is to minimize this factor. Q's Tent, duplication
and a BG Box are all things that come in mind when you want to beat the
odds. In this deck for example, all you need to complete the missions
is Treachery x4 (Secret Salvage & Wormhole) and Arch x2 (Sarthong
Plunder). The only 3 personnel that don't have one or both skills are
Vekor Roga and Takket because their classifications are very useful.

Don't worry about the fact that 5/6 missions are multi-affiliation.
Normally this could be dangerous and would force you to put some of
your dilemmas under your own missons, but in this case you will very
likely be the first one to be able to complete them. In fact, you have
a 20% probability of getting 4 or more Treachery personnel on your
initial draw! If you don't know where those numbers come from, check
out http://www.info.polymtl.ca/~gouache/stccg/tebok000.txt (or ask).

Artifacts: as I said, BG Box will get you the cards you need quickly
and the Thought Maker will do the exact opposite for your opponent. If
you know your opponent uses BG Box too, replace it with a Thermal
Deflector in your draw deck or a Q's Tent (Firestorm can be *really*
dangerous for this deck).

Ohter things to know: do not use your Q'Tent unless you really badly
need something. And remember: in this deck, everyone is expendable.

Hello everyone!

Have you read Wesley's COTD #322? Well here's the attachment...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tebok's STCCG Deck of the Week #37: Fed - Kevinbane -
The deck that loves nullifiers! By Wesley Crusher.

Seed Deck (30):

Missions (6):
Investigate Time Continuum
Evacuation

Dilemmas (18):
Q-Flash x4

Others seed cards (6):

Maques
Lwaxana Troi
Ves Alkar

Juliana Tainer
Ira Graves
Data
Mr. Homn x2
Soong-Type Android x11

Ships (4):
Combat Vessel x4

Interrupts (2):
Kevin Uxbridge x2

Events (0)

Others (2):
Colony x2

Side Decks:
Q's Tent (0)
Q-Continuum (0)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategy: Use Tainer or Graves to quickly get your classifications into
play using STA's. Make sure you get a Homn into your away team. Then,
move all that stuff and play the Empaths to Homn while traveling.

Several BGBs help you get cards faster and the Horga'Hn is there to
build Colony points. The only things you really like to use Kevins on
are SWBs, TAKs and Klim Dokachim.

I used the Combat Vessels because I am short on *'s but have plenty of
+'s on my crew and they have Range 8.

An ideal game:

Turn 1: Tainer / Graves + 4 STAs. Attempt Outpost Mission and overcome
Dilemmas using 1 each of ENGINEER,SCIENCE,MEDICAL,SECURITY.
Turn 2: Bring in an Empath and solve Mission. Get BGB.
Turn 3: Build a Colony. Play any retrieved STAs / Lal as CIVILIANs.
Turn 4: Play a ship , score from Colony.
Turn 5: Play Homn, move non-CIVILIANS and Empath to ship, fly to next
location.
Turn 6: Play another Empath to Homn, solve another mission using two
teams (Androids for Dilemmas, Empaths for mission requirement)
Turn 7: Repeat Turn 6 with a different mission. Win.

Oh, before I go on with my deck, I'd like to mention a *very good*

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The main strategy of this deck is the combination of TAK and HC.
While you get rid of the cards in your opponent's hand with the TAK
and a well (early?) played Life-form Scan, you can also prevent him
>from  getting up to four good cards with the combo SS + HC.
The equation "5 cards to nullify 4 cards" does not apply since the HC
is also useful for the TAK and you have control over the quality of the
cards you're nullifying.

If you're out of SS, you can still know (with a little memory effort)
which cards your opponent has in his hand, thanks to the HC and the
Scan.
There's also an HC in your Q's Tent in case you didn't draw it in your
first few turns. Since there are only three Q's Tents, I suggest you
don't waist them unless it's very necessary.

Missions and personnel are pretty straightforward and can be changed
for about anything else with a low skill/personnel requirement (Try
Joskefet's program!).

        @{b}Tebok's Deck of the Week #39@{ub}

Hello everyone!

Another defeat, another of Koroth's decks.

You are probably aware that the new FAQ rules that "Gowron's Flagship"
is close enough to get Captain's Log benefit. Although it doesn't
really make sense (the Neq'Var is now "Gowron's Flagship" but it was
"commanded" by General Martok) they could either do that or remove
"Commander Toreth's Warbird" and "Subcommander Taris' warbird" from
the list, which wouldn't be very good for the Romulans.
Also note that Taris' warbird doesn't have a capital W. Probably
because she's just a Subcommander (or is it subcommander?). ;-)

So now that we have this great 'new' card for the Klingons, why not
make the best use of it...

The Higher... The Q-er
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A deck of powerful ships. The simple idea here is to use Q's Planet to
get the Kurlan Naiskos fast, and use your dual-classification personnel
(6 out of 15), K'chiQ, STAs (reported via Ira Graves) and finally Q's
Tent to staff it *very* fast. If you're lucky enough to have Nu'Daq and
his Maht-H'a or Gowron and his Bortas out by that time the game is
almost over! If you're not lucky then you'll have to wait for a second
ship. Still not bad... >:->

What about Kevin Uxbridg-ing the Kurlan? You though about that. That's
why you have 4 Q2s in your deck. But there's another reason for those
Q2s...

Q! Under Q's Planet! The best way to make sure your opponent won't
succede before you do. Actually, that's exactly what happened to me. I
managed to attempt Q's Planet before my opponent and I got stopped by
Q. The next thing I knew my Outpost was right next to my opponent's, he
had a Kurlan in his hands and a nasty Klingon away team boosted with
STAs was attacking my poor away team.
In other words, the game wasn't going as expected.

How do you think I lost the game? Yup. Poof went the Outpost.

The rest of the deck is pretty obvious. Easy missions, nasty dilemmas
and "I Am Not A Merry Man" because it's sooo good.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you play in a multiplayer game, there's one thing you should
always keep in mind when building your deck: you're not playing against
someone, you're playing against *everyone* else. Rogue Borgs for
example are very powerful in normal games because they can completely
neutralize your opponent, leaving you all the necessary time to
complete your missions. A Rogue Borg deck in a multiplayer game is not
very wise because you're devoting a quarter of your deck to neutralize
only one adversary, helping the others at the same time. Unless you're
playing each Borg separately, in which case this strategy is X times
less powerful where X is the number of other players.

So what should you do then? Simple, play an individualistic game. Race
for the points. Keep a few stalling cards, because the "usual" strategy
is to hit whoever has more points until someone else takes the lead and
so on, but don't build your deck around a strategy like Heisenberg +
Subspace Schisms.

In this deck I included as many big points missions as I could, while
playing a space only set. There're two big reasons for this: if you had
play Pegasus Search along with normal, 30-35 points missions, chances
are a lot of nasty dilemmas would've ended under it. Second, seed
Barclay's Disease under Pegasus Search and you now have a 60 points
mission and only need to complete any 40 points mission to win.
I know, Pegasus needs Integrity > 40, but that should take you 8-9
personnel. Not that difficult, especially considering that you probably
won't encounter a Borg Ship, a Cytherians or another unavoidable
dilemma there: your opponents will have difficulties resisting the call
of a 50 points steal.

If you loose some points and are short by less than 10, use the
Devidian Door and Samuel Clemens to score a quick 10. Watch out for
Masaka though. Around here, it's in everyone's Q's Tent.

Here's how the game ended, very typical of the Devidian Door:

I was stopped by a Shaka on the Quash Conspiracy mission, where my
outpost was. I had 77 points and there was no other dilemmas left.
I had only one diplomacy in my Away Team (Rakal).
On his turn, one of my opponents destroyed my Outpost. :-(
My turn. I played Q's Tent and retreived Maques.
I said "Devidian Door" and played Maques to my ship.
I then re-attempted the mission, solved Shaka, solved the mission...
...won, and showed Devidian Door!

Strategy:

Seed Outpost at Repair Mission also seed the Cryosatellite there.

As soon as possible attempt Repair Mission after its completed move to
Study Nebula and encounter your Cytherians. With Lakanta move to the
other end very quickly scoring 15 pts and attempt Explore Dyson Sphere
(have rager and/or Mordock) encounter your Barclay's and pass it.
Complete Dyson Sphere for 35 (or up to 45 more points depending on if
you have Rager and/or Mordock) Game Over.
                                                        -Locutus
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A few thoughts, if I may (after all, this deck won a big game recently).

This seems to be a break it or make it kind of deck. With only two ship
(including the Future Enterprise) and a very difficult mission
(Fissure Research), you will probably rely on your Q's Tent more than
you should. And since you also have much needed cards like Red Alert!,
Klim Dokachim and Kevin Uxbridge in your Tent, you run the risk of
running out of Q's Tent sooner than you thought. On the other hand,
cards like Mordock and Rager which can make the five points difference
you need to win should go in the Tent.

Also, I am a big fan of the Q-Continuum side deck. With cards like
Penalty Box and Mandarin Bailiff, at worst your Q-Flash is worth an
Armus/Higher. Not bad...

A few more things. I wonder why he chose to put Robin Lefler in his
deck and Rachel Garett in the Tent instead of the other way around.
I mean, what does she got that the other one does not? Asides from that.
Also, I personnaly prefer Vekor and her Navigation to Katherine Pulaski
and her nothingness...

Federation Outpost

Q-Continuum (0)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This deck is designed to not worry about the probablities.
It has multiple redundies in many areas, and has few disadvantages.
One is that it does not have enough KU, Amandas, and Q2s (all those
people with Q's Tent have more). Another disadvantage(advantage?)
is that it has no Q Continuum (I don't see the point). All it has
is two revolving doors.
                                                --Dan Pandre

--------------------------------------------------------------------

And now my analysis...

With 19 personnel in the draw deck, and 4 more in the Q's Tent,
this deck sure is safe on the personnel side! Dan made use of
Q's Tent primarily as a "backup" deck, one wich duplicates almost
all necessary skill and interrupts/events in his draw deck.
That's not a bad idea, though it requires more than 3 Tents to be
effective IMO (4-5 should be good).

I would also add a Q-Continuum, for the bluff. Even if you don't
seed Q-Flashes it's still a good idea to place a fake Q-Continuum
because the power of the QC also lies in the threat it represents.
If it can convince your opponent to send a trimmed Away Team,
thereby making your dilemmas more effective, then it has fulfilled
its mission and the "waisted" Q-Flash is justified.

Perhaps this deck's biggest enemy is... itself! To quote my friend
Hugh, "this deck needs *more* dilemmas". With only ten to slow down
your opponent, your margin of error is VERY thin and your timing
must be impeccable. If your opponent gets a good draw, you're in big
trouble...

may'Daq bIQapjaj!

Hello everyone!

Here's a deck I wanted to do for a while. It's based on the combo
Brain Drain - Isabella. Just remember to space out the nebulas (if
you can). When I played the deck, I completely to forgot about that,
with disastrous consequences (I didn't seed Q)...

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Tebok's STCCG Deck of the Week #44: Fed - Little Isabella -

Seed Cards (25):

Aldebaran Serpent x2
Door-Net x2
Incoming Message - The Continuum x2
The Higher... The Q-er x2
Frigid x2
Where's Guinan?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The strategy is simple, wait until your opponent stops on a nebula
(you can also use the Warp Rifts to help it) and play Isabella,
backed with Brain Drain to remove youth and Rogue Borgs to prevent
other ships from coming to the rescue. BOOM!
Of course, you need to carfully select your target too: the combo
costs 3-4 cards (Isa + Borg + Drain + Rift) so unless you destroy
a whole bunch'O people, it ain't worth it.
Not a tourney-level deck, but it's soooo fun when it works you don't
even care if you win or loose afterward...

This deck features several ways to get bonus points so you don't have
to complete more than three missions. Of course, it's a bit ineffective
to try all those strategies at the same time (you need too many
resources for some bonus) but a theme deck is a theme deck...

First, there is Timicin and Test Mission, The 5 poi...

-Hey! Waitaminute. There's no Timicin in your deck!

Oops. Right. In fact, it was there during gameplay but it's so
ineffective that I replaced both with Repair Mission for the same point
value. 'Nuff said.

Then comes Mirasta Yale, uncovered just before Sarjenka. An easy 10
points is always a good thing. The only problem is that you have to
protect her during the whole game. For example, my opponent played
Klingon. I had to get Mirasta very early in the game or else my
'rescue' Team would've been attacked by a Klingon commando right after
it was stopped by Sarjenka.

Rager is safer. Slight problem though: if she's near the bottom of your
deck you'll be temped to wait before you attempt Dyson Sphere.
Solutions: Q's Tent or BGBox. But then you (again) have a two cards
combo.

Kova Tholl: Interesting. 10 points is good but you need your opponent's
cooperation. You also need to carefully select his crewmates if you want
to trigger his bonus. Tholl + Runabout + Borg Ship works fine but a
three cards combo is not something I rely on.

Mordok: the kind of card you don't show early if your opponent's isn't
playing Federation. In my case, his bonus was nullified when I got
attacked without provocation by my opponent's Away Team, before Mordok
was even in play. You can also stack a couple of helper cards like Hail
or Asteroid Sanctuary, but then you end up with a 3+ combo for 5 puny
points...

Samuel Clemens: Ah. Now we're talking. Very easy 10 points, if you can
show your Devidian Door that is. You should wait 'till you have 90+
points for maximum efficiency. Declare DDoor, play a personnel, complete
a mission for 90 points, next turn report Clemens and show DDoor. Tada!
For more safety you should have a second DDoor in your Q's Tent. Slight
problem: Masaka (always in my opponent's Q's Tent) and Wrong Door.
Solution: Zalkonian Storage Capsule. Uh, did I say 3+ cards combo?

Conclusion: if you want a fast bonus, put a Barclay's Disease under
your own mission instead. Easiest 10 points you'll ever make.

ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple startegy, yet not very effective. The idea is to mine the
spaceline with AMPs and then finish the job with your ships. Here's
what to keep in mind...

1)AMPs are easy to nullify.
Although Transporter Skill is not a common skill in all decks, having
only one can give a 4 cards advantage to your opponent. :-(
NOT having Transporter Skill will force your opponent to stack his
personnel on one single ship, to have the 3 Nav requirement. A perfect
target for your Armada. Brain Drain can also help you.

2)AMPs are slow to seed.
You need to actually put the AMPs where you want them to be. That can
slow you down very much. The best thing is to seed your outpost near
your opponent's, and then place AMPs nearby.

Are AMPs worthwhile?
I've seen combos with fewer cards getting better results. Right now,
I'd say their best use is to nullify Manheim's Dimensional Door, and
even that isn't great. Maybe stock one in Q's Tent...
That doesn't mean it's not fun to play though. The joy of being able to
pull off the combo is worth playing the game by itself! But in tourney,
this is a card that'll stay in your binder, just between Baryon Buildup
and Warp Core Breach.

Everybody should have its own version of the Mission Impossible deck.
It's The Ultimate Challenge. The Rite of Ascension. The Maso-Deck. The
If-you-win-with-that-I-will-strip-naked-and-walk-outside-to-shout-your-
name deck.

One mission I would never leave out, though, is Qualor II, *THE* most
impossible mission of all (unless of course your opponent has very few
dilemmas). Use instead of the Nebula and you now have the perfect set.

Also, the heavy duplication marks the need for a Q's Tent. Or does it?
Here's the catch: if you put all three Treaties plus the Red Alert in
the Tent and retreive them one by one, it'll be slow. Really slow. On
the other hand, if you double each treaty card, you'll loose some
valuable space for, say, interrupts maybe?
The simple answer is: no three way treaty. In normal game, that is. This
is a theme deck and theme decks work under a different set of rules...

Finally, a small Q-Continuum side deck is never a good idea. Using a
seven cards QC is like telling your opponent "I seeded only one Q-Flash,
so don't bother trimming your Away Teams after that". If you really want
your opponent to hit a specific Q-card, *this* is the time to use
duplication.

'nuff said. Try it and enjoy, you little perverse... ;-)

Press 'next'. This message will not autodestruct.

Which one is better? Star Trek or Star Wars? Hey, why not have the best

(music)
                          CHAPTER IV: A NEW HOPE
It is a period of war. Federation spaceships, striking from a hidden
base, have won a big victory against the evil Klingon Empire.
During the battle, Federation spies managed to steal secret plans to the
Empire's ultimate weapon, the Tox Uthat, an artifact with enough power
to destroy an entire planet.
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Robin Lefler races home aboard
her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and
restore freedom to the quadrant...

Here's how to play this deck:

1)Each time you report a main character, quote one of his/her line. Worf
has the easiest one to remember...

2)Then, redshirt with Lakanta and say: "I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone."

3)After that, each time you attempt a mission with Wes, say: "Use the
Force, Luke."

4)If you succeed, say: "Remember, the Force will be with you...always."

5)If you're about to destroy a ship with Will Riker and the Enterprise,
say: "Now let's blow this thing and go home!"

6)If Wes is in one of your attacking ships, add: "Great shot, kid. That
was one in a million."

7)If Exocomp is killed, shout: "Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say
something!" Start to do the CPR (no wait, that'll be for the Baywatch
theme ;-)

8)Growl at ramdom as long as Worf is alive.

9)Just before you reach 100 points say, in your best imitation of Red
Leader's voice: "Almost there!"

10)If you win, start to hum the 'ceremony' theme from A New Hope.

11)If you loose, hum the 'empire' theme from The Empire Stikes Back.

               CHAPTER V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK
   It is a dark time for the Federation. Although the Tox Uthat has
been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Federation forces from
their hidden base and pursued them across the quadrant.
   Evading the dreaded Klingon fleet, a group of freedom fighters
led by Wesley Crusher has established a new secret base on the remote
ice world of Hoth.

dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space...

galaxy..."

If you're winning, say: "now release your anger."

If you win, hum the 'empire' theme from The Empire Stikes Back.

If you loose, hum the 'Massassi Throne Room' theme.

Finally made it! Wheeee!
After a few months of thinking and deck building, I couldn't decide on
what to do for this special edition. Well, I have decide not to do
anything special/strange/unusual. Instead, I'm just going to post a
*very* nasty deck, one that was only twarthed by a well placed Q-Net.
It's the kind of deck that you don't, I repeat *don't*, play against
someone in a friendly sunday afternoon game. Unless you want your
opponent to have a pretty disapointing afternoon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Soooo... an armada deck eh? Nothing special about this, except this
one will usualy take 4 to 7 turns to work...

The beauty of this deck (compared to the previous version) is that the
combo Kivas + Q's Tent allows you to get all your necessary crew out
fast, while still having enough time to complete 3-4 missions by
retreiving at random from your Q's Tent to prevent deck exhaustion.

If you like number, take a look at the numbers below. They're based on
the Hypergeometric formula, used to calculate the outcome of a serie
of dependant events. Suffice is to say it is pretty fast.

It has some drawbacks though: for it to be so effective, I had to limit
the 'extra' cards to a strict minimum, thereby no interrupts. That
means no Kevins, Q2s or Amandas in the deck. Crazy? A little bit. You
have to be very careful about the Sheliak-Q combo or a well placed
Q-Net. Retrieve Distortion or Kevin if you hit Sheliak-Q or Q-Net.

Once your opponent's outpost is destroyed, start completing missions!
Sounds simple? Check closer. You don't have any MEDICAL or SCIENCE, so
you'll have to Red Shirt to clear the dilemmas, unless you're lucky
enough to draw one of them from your Q's Tent. Also note that Nu'Daq
and B'Etor are the only personnel in your draw pile that can complete
"Gault" and "A Good Place to Die" respectively so take good care of
them.

A treaty deck will also give the deck a good fight since your opponent
has more than one outpost in play.

If possible, start using your Q's Tent at least 4 cards before the end
of you draw deck or your opponent could play a Kivas on you to limit
your win to 1 point.

L'Armada III will probably have only 10 ships and 10 Leaders or less
dilemmas because your Q's Tent is essential or you'll run out of
cards too soon. It can also be used as a last resort against a Yellow
Alert or other nasty events...

Finally, the dilemma selection needs a little tuning , I believe.


Try it out! Don't forget to take a picture of your opponent's face when
you report 7 K'Vorts at the same time... :-)


Next week, Jon Berry brings us his common deck...

Hi there!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Jon's comments:

This deck is designed so that you put the DH and PR's on either ship
and move fast to get missions done.  On the Decius, you move very fast.
On the HS you mave not as fast, but will out run most ships but will
take a pounding and give one too.

Tebok's analysis:

Where to start? First of all, this deck may be a 'fast' deck (because of
the fast moving Decius), but it is most definetely not a 'speed' deck.
Think of this: to move the Decius, first you need to draw it, which will
most probably take time (a BGBox could speed up that process).
Then you need to wait for the necessary personnel to staff it. To speed
this up you could play a Treaty, but that treaty will be as difficult
to get than the Decius itself. Natch!

If, instead, you draw the Husnock first, then you need a Plasmadyne
Relay to achive anything interesting. If on top of that you want
Data's Head, then you need to get enough personnel to attempt and
complete a mission, which will take even more time.

I can see the usefulness of such cards as TAK and TR to slow down your
opponent will you get your necessary cards, but you need to draw them
too (am I beeing redundant? ;-). All these cards (and thus your
strategy) could benefit greatly from a Q's Tent, which would allow you
to get the card you want when you want it. Put those events in your
Tent, along with the Decius (replace them with a few Tents) and I can
tell you your deck will gaing a lot of speed (even with the Tent's 'no
draw' downside).

Finally, remember that the goal is to score points, not to move fast
at any cost. What's the point of gaining 3 range if it takes 3 turns to
get?
I once played in a tournament against a young boy who managed to boost
his Husnock's shields to 130+ (!) with the use of Metaphasic Shields,
Nutational Shields, PRs, Kurlan, you name it. By the time he achieved
that, though, it was 65-0 for me. So much for usefulness...

No ratings today. This deck needs a little tuning.

Last week, we learned that Wes is in love with Robin, a childhood
friend. Linda, one of their friends, is jealous and tries to ruin their
relationship.
We also learned that Linda's brother, Simon, canceled his wedding with
Ishara to prove his love to Kareen.
Meanwhile Sonya, back from earth, found her boyfriend in the arms of
her best friend Jaxa!

What will happen? We'll never know because this week, another bunch of
totally insignificant and unrelated events happen.

First, miss McKnight explains to her roommates Rager and Calloway her
true vision of life. Young Alexander, who overhears the conversation,
is traumatised by her revelations and decides to become a warrior.
Guisti breaks a fingernail. Her life will never be the same again.

Meanwhile, Lal constructs another Soong-type Android to keep her
company. A passionate love story ensues, ending by the dramatic
system-wide cascade failure of Lal's positronic brain. Snif.

Next week, Sakket undergoes Pon farr and chooses T'Shanik to be his
mate. She accepts. Don't miss this great vulcan drama, next week...

        @{b}Tebok's Deck of the Week #53@{ub}

Hello everyone!

Well well, what have we got here! No, I'm not talking about First Contact
rules, I'm talking about a new edition of Tebok's DOTW!

The recent World Championship Regionals have seen *many* different deck
strategies making it all the way to the finals. One of them, one of my
favorite, being the so called Borg Hunter Deck. With the Borg just around
the corner, those decks could see a lot more action in the future than I
thought after the World Finals, where my BH deck, well, kinda missed the
target once or twice...

So here they are, not one but *two* Borg Hunter Decks that got the owner a
ticket to Las Vegas. One by Sirna and one by me.

[Comments by Sirna]

   Well there it is. The thing about this deck is that it almost plays
itself. OK you can only complete Warped Space so seed your Cryo there
and then seed the Borg Ships last. Then Begin redshirting with Torin.
Tent for any cards you need to get past dilemmas that Torin does not
pass or get killed by. Use Quark for Ancient Computer, Dathon For Shaka,
Plexing for Empathic Echo and Frame of Mind, Destroy Radioactive Garbage
Scow for the Radioactive Garbage Scow and any of the unique personel for
the Cardasian Trap [I thought about Tarmin for this but decided
otherwise].

   Once Torin has redshirted through it all tent for Vekor to
solve Warped Space. Then put your crew and the Kurlan on your ship and
go hunt Borg Ships. Tent for the distortion to take extra shots at the
Borg Ships and Palor Toff the Distortion back to keep on going. Easy
huh? The Wrong Doors are for keeping your tent open from Revolving Doors
and to stop or slow down tenting.

   The Palor Toffs are what make this deck fast. You can Palor so much
>from  Tents to Kivases and even the Kurlan. Amanda Rogers protects against
Senior Staff meeting and Madam Guinan protects against Brain Drain. The
rest of the tent : The Traveler to get card advantage and to suck Kevins,
AU Door for Temporal Rifts, Res-Q in case you need to get a Torin back,
The Devil for Flutes and Horgahns, Alien Parasites for Qs Planet and
Yellow Alert for Red Alert!s. The Yellow works better I have found because
it is less expected.

This is the exact deck that won me my Regional.


[Tebok's comments]

  3 personnel! *Ouch*. 4 Kivases aren't too many for this one. I didn't
asked, but I wonder how many times our friend has lost his Torin to a
Penalty Box or a Barclay and was stuck with no personnel to continue
redshirting. Hmm. I can see the usefulness of the two Wrong Doors and
the Palors 'cause the deck wouldn't survive a closed Q's Tent.
No Vekor = no Kurlan = no points...

  Let's look at this deck's strenghs. First of all: duplication. This
deck has so many redundant cards that it almost nullifies the random
factor of the initial draw. OK, you still need at least one of those
four Q's Tent before your Palors are of any use, so you're stuck with
that usual 67%[1] again. But then you probably won't need any QT for a few
turns. What you need is Torins and Kivases. 7 cards = 88% probability and
rising. Not bad.

  Another strength: potential speeeeed!
With only two personnel needed to solve Warped Space (Torin and Vekor),
you can potentially start hunting Borg Ships in 4 turns! Add Distortion
and a few Palors and it could be *over* in 4 turns!! Add a Devidian Door
and this could be a 3 turns deck!!! I've done it in six. That's still not
so bad.

   There are a few more things, but let's see my deck first, 'cause they are
very much alike.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   As you can see, I'm not going to repeat what Sirna said. The two decks
play exactly the same. Short manual: redshirt Torin, solve Warped Space,
attack one Borg Ship, play Distortion, rince, repeat. 135 points.

A couple interesting differences though...

More Q2s

   Q2 is the single most important card in my deck. It helps protect my
Kurlan, it's useful against a Q deck, it protects my Arbiter of Succession
(a backup plan in case one of your Borg Ship is buried under a few dilemmas),
it protects my Distortions, Devil, etc... No wonder I've put so many of them.


More personnel

   I prefered to use 6 Atrophysicians and 4 Navigators in the draw deck.
That way you're less vulnerable to nasty dilemmas during the redshirt phase.
If everything goes well, you can also retreive Vekor and get going after
4 turns.

   If your opponent doesn't play Klingon, start redshirting as soon as
possible to uncover all the nasty dilemmas, especially Cardie Traps, Shakas
and Radioactive Scows. You can then use your precious Q's Tent to retreive
the needed remedy (remember, there's no Wrong Door in my deck).

What happens if you loose a Torin (or two) too early?
No problem: Yellow Alert. Especially good against Ressikan Flute decks,
Fed speed decks, etc. And what's you defense against Kevins? That's right,
Q2 again.


The CryoCrew

   I prefered K'chiQ to Madam Guinan because she can provide a 6th type. Yes,
that's six personnel types in your Cryo! You're only missing SCIENCE, but
that's exaclty what you need to solve Warped Space so...
   Since K'chiQ provides the MEDICAL, you don't absolutely need Vekor. That's
why all my other personnel (except Dathon, for Shaka) have navigation.
I noticed that it often take two to three turns to clear all the dilemmas so
you get enough time to report the extra SCIENCE you'll need to complete the
mission. The less you must rely on your Q's Tent, the better.


More Ships

  I have three ships, all 9 weapons 8 shields, that gives W27 S24 when Kurlan
is in effect (no damage to the ship). I also have a Husnock in my Q's Tent
just in case. 18 range is probably enough anyway... ;-)


On Q's Tent

   With prior version of my deck, a closed doorway was a nightmare. I made
the correct adjustements to make sure it doesn't happen again. Of coures,
I would still hate to see it closed (especially if there's a Garbage Scow on
top of my mission), but I can win pretty easily without touching it.


On the Q-Continuum

   I love the Q-Flash. Can't live without it. Aldebaran is one of my favorite
Q-Card because it can rapidly slow down the opponent. It makes the Q-Flash
very versatile: if your opponent attempts with a big crew, you'll loose half
of your Q-Flash but the opponent will encounter Penalty Box and Scottish Setter
(the other best two QC cards IMHO). On the other hand, if he decides to
redshirt, here comes the Serpent!


Plan B

  You can complete the five other missions, in case something goes wrong...
You can also seed Barclay for yourself to get the last 10 points.



So? Which one is the best? Though to say. Sirna's Palor Toffs and Wrong Doors
are clearly a winner, whereas I think my Torinsss make the deck faster and
safer.

Oh, and one more thing. Don't forget to seed you Cryo *AFTER* your personnel.
This could cost you a game...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quiz: which cards you though were absolutely necessary to win a tournament
aren't present in my deck?

[1]Probability of drawing at least one of those cards in the initial draw.
See the statistical analysis on my web site.

[Comments by Kevin]

This deck is an *extremely* versatile deck, which could possibly be one of
it's weaknesses. Basicaly, you decide before the game, which affiliation
you would like to play, based on your opponents strengths and weaknesses.
You have a Neutral Outpost, which, under FC rules, you are allowed to seed.
During the game you Tent for any of the Affiliated personell. One of the
few other Tent cards you should have is a NA ship, whatever you choose, but
a high range ship is advisable. Only once you have solved the Q-2
Rendezvous, should you bring in affiliated personell. Unfortunately, the
only current NA missions are planet, so ALL your opponents planet dillemas
will be seeded there, which is a problem.

Another thing is, you can only realistically expect to solve WN with all
three affiliations, and Pegasus Search ony if you bring in
Interphase Generator. You can also expect to solve Q2R (if you're lucky),
but this deck is perfect for a fun-filled theme.

For those of you that only appreciate something that wins tourneys, and
don't care about the fun in deck design, then this series (DOTW) is
definitely not for you.


[Comments by Tebok]

OK, first you'll notice that this deck isn't complete, which means our
friend hasn't playtest the idea. I'll take this opportunity to mention
that I normally don't post any deck that requires me to "fill-in the gaps"
because Murphy's Law states that I will invariably end up spoiling the idea.
To resume, here's what a good deck submission should have:

1) Complete list of a playable deck
2) Any useful info on how to play it
3) It's strengths and especially it's weaknesses (if you know them) this
will allow interested players to modify your idea based on your feedback.
4) Your name/net.alias and your email address so I can give you credit.

Now back to our deck. I decided to post this one because the idea looks very
interesting to me. I wouldn't play it exactly as Kevin suggests though:
I see this deck more as a mission stealer.

If you remember my DOTW #14, I designed a non-aligned commando capable of
stealing a lot of Fed missions, and I used Mjr Rakal to allow them to
attempt. Well this deck goes a little further: wait for your opponent to put
his missions and *then* customize your commando.

With any luck, you'll be able to steal two or three missions before you go
for your Wormhole. Thanks for playing.
Be careful during the seed phase and place your nastiest dilemmas under
those missions you know you won't steal.

Of course if your opponent plays Borg...

Other cards worth including:
AU Door, a few Wrong Door, Yellow Alert, at least 4 ships, 5 Q's Tent.
