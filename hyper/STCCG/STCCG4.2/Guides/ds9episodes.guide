  @{b}The Emissary@{ub}

Commander Benjamin Sisko and his son Jake, both survivors of the Wolf 359
Borg massacre, arrive at the planet Bajor as part of a Starfleet team taking
over the abandonded Cardassian space station Deep Space 9. The station,
which was intentionally damaged by the Cardassians before they left it behind,
is being pieced together by newly-transferred Operations Chief O'Brien from
the Enterprise. Sisko also meets Major Kira, his Bajoran first officer, who
doubts the ability of the provisional government of Bajor to avert a civil
war and trusts the Federation even less; Odo a mysterious shapeshifter in
charge of station security; and Quark, the suspicious Ferengi kingpin who's
eager to get out of town before the regulatory hand of the Federation clamps
down on his shady "business" affairs. Sisko is summoned to the Enterprise for
a briefing with Captain Picard, whom he still remembers as the man responsible
for the death of thousands, including Sisko's wife, in the Borg invasion
attempt. Picard gives Sisko the Federation's orders regarding management of
Deep Space 9 - to do everything, short of violating the prime directive, to
get the struggling Bajorans back on their feet so they can join the Federation.
Sisko however is considering resigning from Starfleet to raise his son in a
better environment. Soon afterwards, the Enterprise departs to undertake other
duties as the station's new doctor, the brilliant but inexperienced Julian
Bashir, and science officer Jadzia Dax arrive. Dax, a Trill who has lived in
a number of bodies, is an old fried of Sisko's. Sisko, at the suggestion of
Kira, travels to Bajor and visits Bajoran spiritual leader Kai Opaka, who
tells Sisko that he is to be the emissary of the people to the temple of
their gods. Opaka reveals an Orb, a mystic object of a type which has appeared
throughout Bajoran history. The Orb envelops Sisko in a brief recollection of
his first meeting with his wife, and then releases him. Opaka gives him the
Orb, and the news that Sisko - whether he likes it or not, whether he even
knows it or not - will find the temple. He returns to Deep Space 9 and hands
the Orb over to Dax for further study. The Cardassians return, ostensibly to
make use of the station's amenities. Dax discovers that reports of the Orb's
appearances correspond to a certain area of space near Bajor. Dax and Sisko set
out in a Federation Runabout to investigate and stumble across a wormhole that
shoots them 70,000 light years across the galaxy. Trying to return to the
station, their ship is halted. Dax is taken back to the station by an Orb,
while Sisko is kept and studied by noncorporeal beings who built the wormhole.
These beings have no conception of linear time, existing simultaneously in
the past, present and future, and they ask Sikso questions about the ephemeral
nature of humans, which they do not comprehend. Dax, back on Deep Space 9,
fills the crew in on details of the wormhole. Major Kira orders O'Brien to
shift the station's position so that it stands in front of the wormhole. A
Cardassian ship, however, enters the wormhole, but is damaged by the wormhole
life forms. When another Cardassian flotilla arrives and finds no sign of the
missing ship, they threaten to open fire on Deep Space 9 unless Kira aggrees
to surrender the station. In the wormholee, the aliens' study of Sisko reaches
an end when they discover the human drive for knowledge, and they are puzzled
by Sisko's inability to live down the death of his wife.. At the station,
Kira's brinksmanship abilites and her feisty confrontations with the
Cardassians result in a firefight, damaging the station heavily. The solution
to the confrontation lies with Sisko, if he can overcome the wormhole beings'
manifestations of his inner barriers and escape from the wormhole.

Shortly after Dr. Bashir excitedly reports to Sisko a meeting with a
merchant who happens to be the only remaining Cardassian on the station,
a Bajoran ship is detected with hostile Cardassians hot in pursuit. The
single occupant of the damaged Bajoran vessel is beamed aboard and is
discovered to be a member of a group of violent Bajoran extremists who
have not yet ceased their terrorism against the Cardassians. Requesting
asylum, all Tahna does is invite Sisko's suspicion. Sisko is further put
in a tenous situation when the Cardassian ship's commander demands that
Tahna be turned over for his crimes against the Cardassians. Kira, herself
a former member of Tahna's underground, tries to convince Tahna to give
up his violent tactics, but he refuses, and it turns out that his visit
to Deep Space 9 is all part of another of his inevitably bloody gambits
for revenge. This time, however, Tahna plans action not only against the
Cardassians, but the Federation as well - and he expects Kira to help

During routine banter with Quark on the Promenade, Odo spots Ibundan,

get into a fight almost immediately. Not long afterward, Ibundan is
found dead in one of the Promenade's holosuits, and evidence has been
carefully placed to lead a trail to Odo, a suspicion which spreads
among the station's populace along with rumours of Odo being a
Cardassian agent and a growing paranoia. Bashir and Dax begin putting
together pieces of a puzzle which include DNA traces from Ibundan's
ship, but in the meantime, the station's residents grow restless and
demand that Odo be handed over to be punished for a crime they believe
he commited. While Sisko and his crew are working full-time on finding
the solution to the crime, the denizens of Deep Space 9 seem to have
no intention of allowing Odo to survive long enough to stand trial.

Business as usual is keeping O'Brien the busiest man on DS9, as
systems continously break down almost at random, mainly food replicators.
In the course of his repairs, O'Brien accidentally activates a concealed
Bajoran device designed to release an adaptive virus into the food
generated by that replicator. He is immediately stricken with the
disease, which scrambles his brain's ability to connect language,
stimuli and responses. Quark, impatient to get service back on schedule

a stationwide epidemic ensues. Bashir, before falling victiom to the

nearl-abandonded station with the aid of Quark, who doesn't know
what they're really after. The leader of the intruders is Verad, a

board as unfit for the joining, and he intends to steal the symbiont
Dax. As the crew is held hostage, Bashir is coerced into performing
the operation to implant Dax into Verad. As Bashir struggles to
keep Jadzia alive long enough to reunite her with Dax, Sisko tries
to keep the newly integrated Verad Dax talinkg in hope of appealing

Bajor. This draws the attention of the Cardassian government,
particularly Gul Dukat, who claims he is eager to solve the
dilemma of Cardassian war orphans left behind on Bajor. DS9's
resident tailor, Garak, seems to find Dukat's sudden pledge to
resolve the abandoned children's situation ironic, since the
boy in question is really the son of one of the civilian assembly
who voted to pull the Cardassian military out of Bajoran space -
one of Dukat's political adversaries. Sisko and Dr. Bashir, aided
and abetted by Garak's cryptic advice, must decide the fate of 
the Cardassian youth, possibly deciding the end result of an
internal power struggle whose combatants couldn't care less

wither under an attack from the Jem'Hadar. Commander Sisko, having
gone to Earth for Starfleet briefings on the threat from the Gamma

small ship originally created to do battle with the Borg. Carrying
more firepower than any other Starfleet ship and a cloaking device
loaned by the Romulans, the Defiant is to go to the Dominion before
the Dominion arrives in the Alpha Quadrant; if need be, the ship is
also to take the fight to the other side of the galaxy. Annother
innovation brought aboard by Starfleet Command is the transfer of
a Starfleet security officer to the station, relieving Odo of all
but station-bound security matters. The shapeshifter withdraws in
anger while Sisko assembles a crew for the Defiant's mission to seek
out the Dominion for negotiations, but joins the Defiant crew at the

little help in the search for the Founders of the Dominion, but

A drunk Klingon named Kozak tries to kill Quark in a dispute over
his bar tab, and winds up falling on his own knife by accident. Quark,
attempting to boost business, tells Odo that he bravely killed Kozak
in self-defense. Odo warns that Kozak's family will come after Quark
to claim the right of vengeance, which springs to mind very quickly
when a new Klingon arrival who claims to be Kozak's brother D'Ghor
accosts Quark on the station. But D'Ghor doesn't want revenge, he

During an informal home-cooked dinner held by Sisko for the senior

out, seemingly at random, a tune which she becomes preoccupied with,
and it follows her into some disturbing hallucinations of masked figures.
A medical checkup reveals some deficiencies in the chemical links between
Jadzia and the Dax symbiont, necessitating a trip to the the specialized
medical facilities on the Trill planet. Though she shows favorable
response to her initial treatments, Dax goes into shock when the computer
abord the Defiant displays a picture of the Trill composer of the song
that has been on her mind. Sisko and Bashir try to seek out the mysterious
link with the long-dead musician and Dax only to have all the official
channels closed in their faces to protect a devastating secret, the cost
of which will be Jadzia's life.

Kira sets off for Bajor when it is revealed that her memories of a
specific event in the Cardassian occupation differ with the official
records of the Bajoran central archives. She never makes it to the
archives, however, because she is captured and transported to Cardassia
Prime, where she wakes up with the features of a Cardassian. She is
told time and time again that she is, in fact, a Cardassian by birth
whose deep cover spying assignment necessitated her cosmetic alteration
to look like a Bajoran rebel named Kira Nerys who was captured and killed.
But she begins to worry when the Cardassians' efforts to make her believe
this story seem to go above and beyond their normal brainwashing techniques,
including the arrival of a high-ranking Legate who claims that Kira is his
daughter. Kira doesn't have any information that the Cardassians would go
to these lengths to retrieve and begins to wonder if perhaps the history
of which she has just learned is true.

Within hours, the child seems to be at least eight years old and can already

by Gul Dukat to halt any uprising by the Bajoran slave workers years ago,
but its countermeasures are still potent, ranging from force fields and
bulkheads to deadly gas. When these obstacles are thwarted by the crew,

He offers to take Nog to Earth in it, with Rom piloting - but of course Quark has
ulterior motives; smuggling illegal kemosite to Orion on the way back. However,
due to the ship's having been sabotaged by Gaila, the three Ferengi (plus one
stowaway) end up going through a time warp to Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. But
far from trying to go home while leaving the timeline intact, Quark has other
plans... to stay and take over Earth.

ships throughout the Starfleet. Meanwhile, Odo continues to struggle with
reconciling his thoughts for the Female Shapeshifter and remaining loyal to his

joining physically - with the fellow Changeling. Rom is sentenced to execution for
interfering in Dominion efforts to destroy the minefield barricading Jem'Hadar
reinforcements on the other side of the wormhole. When Quark promises his brother
he will find a way to free him, Rom tells him it is more important that he destroys
the beam being used to take down the minefield. Kira asks Ziyal to convince her
father, Gul Dukat, to release Rom, but Dukat turns his daughter down. Meanwhile,
Quark learns that the minefield will be destroyed within a week, allowing thousands
of Dominion troops to come through the wormhole and flood the Alpha Quadrant. Quark
and Kira realize they must warn Starfleet, so Jake smuggles out an encrypted message

although needed reinforcements are days away from arrival. Tracking the movements
of the Federation fleet, Dukat and Weyoun realize something big is being planned.
However, Dukat is more concerned about reconciling with Ziyal. He sends Damar, his

With Sisko in command of the Defiant, the Federation fleet reaches the Dominion

target only the Cardassian vessels, hoping to provoke them into breaking formation.
On the space station, Damar - Gul Dukat's aide - is concerned that Kira, Jake,
and Leeta might try to sabotage their plans again, so Dukat orders them held for
questioning. The minefield that barricades the wormhole will be destroyed in hours,
allowing thousands of waiting Dominion ships to invade the Alpha Quadrant and
defeat the Federation. Although Dukat catches on to Sisko's plan, he lets his
enemy through with hopes of toying with him later. Knowing it's a trap, Sisko
insists on staying his course. Meanwhile, Odo is upset when he learns that Kira
has been arrested. The battle rages on, and the Defiant is the only ship to get
through the Dominion line, with the help of Worf's Klingon reinforcements. On the
station, Quark and Ziyal break out Rom, Kira, Jake and Leeta from prison. As Odo
joins forces with his former comrades, Rom and Kira hurry to cut off power to the
weapons array which will detonate the minefield, but are too late. Grimly, Sisko
exercises his only remaining option and takes the Defiant into the wormhole.
Inside the wormhole, the entire Dominion fleet - and certain destruction - awaits
the single ship. Suddenly, the wormhole aliens communicate with Sisko -they do not
want him to die. Sisko pleads with them to save the Bajorans, who created an
entire religion around them. He is then abruptly returned to the Defiant, but
the enormous Dominion fleet still approaches. Sisko gives the order to fire, but
the ships are hit with a series of energy jolts and mysteriously disappear. Dukat
is shocked when the Defiant emerges from the wormhole - alone. As Sisko opens
fire on the station, Damar learns two hundred more Federation ships are headed
their way. The Dominion troops are all ordered to retreat to Cardassia, and Dukat
asks his daughter to accompany him, but Ziyal refuses. She reveals that she helped
Kira and the others escape from the holding cell, but she tells Dukat that she
loves him just before Damar kills her. Devastated, Dukat remains - a shell of his
former self - while the others evacuate and Sisko and the crew joyfully return

Worf's plans for a traditional Klingon wedding are threatened when Martok's wife
refuses to accept Dax into their family. With war still raging throughout the
galaxy, and life returning to normal on Deep Space Nine, Worf and Dax resume
planning their long-awaited wedding. Since Dax will be joining Worf's surrogate
family, the House of Martok, she agrees to endure the traditional evaluation by
the mistress of the house, Martok's wife, Sirella. Confident that she will be
liked and accepted, Dax is surprised when she learns that as a non-Klingon she
will almost certainly fail to gain Sirella's favor. Learning that Sirella
disapproves of Dax, Worf asks Martok to intervene. Martok refuses to get
involved, but agrees to participate in Kal'Hyah, the traditional Klingon "bachelor
party." Sisko, O'Brien, Bashir, and Alexander -- Worf's son -- eagerly join them,
but are disappointed when they learn that the "party" is light on fun an heavy on
fasting, bloodletting, and other uniquely Klingon forms of torture. Meanwhile,
Dax endures her own form of Klingon torture as she struggles to please Sirella.
When she is asked to recite the history of the House of Martok, Dax gleefully
reveals her discovery that Sirella has no imperial blood, and is in fact descended
from a concubine. Naturally, Sirella is infuriated. Ready for a little fun, Dax
throws herself a pre-wedding party. In the midst of the drinking and debauchery,
Sirella demands that Dax join her for a ritual. When Dax tells her to leave,
Sirella threatens to cancel the wedding. The confrontation ends with Sirella
declaring Dax an enemy. The next morning, Worf informs Dax that Sirella has
forbidden her to join the House of Martok. He asks her to beg Sirella's
forgiveness, but Dax refuses to endure that humiliation just so Worf can have
a Klingon ceremony. Angrily, both Worf and Dax call off the wedding. Martok
convinces Worf to apologize to Dax, but she refuses to change her mind. Determined
to see the lovers wed, Sisko goes to see Dax himself. She describes the indignities
to which she has been subjected, reminding Sisko that, as Curzon Dax, she was
Federation Ambassador to the Klingon Empire! Sisko gently points out that Sirella
only sees her as a young woman who wants to marry into her family. He states that
Dax knew what she was getting into when she agreed to marry Worf, and that she
must honor the traditions of his people. Warmed by her deep love for Worf, Dax
follows Sisko's advice, and she and Worf are married -- with Sirella's blessing.

Odo is lured to a secret meeting site, where he finds himself face to face
with Weyoun, the Vorta leader of the enemy Dominion. Weyoun announces that
he's decided to defect and, in exchange for asylum, he promises to provide
valuable information that could help the Federation win the war. After the
two board Odo's Runabout, the ship is hailed by the Cardassians. Odo is
shocked when the monitor displays Weyoun standing beside Damar. The Weyoun
Odo has taken aboard the Runabout is actually a clone known as WV-Six, while
the "real" Weyoun - the seventh clone - is still loyal to the Dominion cause.
When WV-Six defies Weyoun's order to activate his termination implant, and Odo
refuses to turn him over, Damar and Weyoun vow to destroy the Federation ship.
But WV-Six doubts the verity of Weyoun's threat - for Odo is a Founder, the
race worshipped by the Vorta. Nonetheless, Damar summons the Jem'Hadar, and
they besiege the Federation craft with gunfire. WV-Six informs Odo of the
attacking ship's weakness, and Odo destroys it. While awaiting the enemy's
next move, WV-Six explains why his people worship Odo's race: the Founders
transformed WV-Six's ape-like ancestors into powerful beings. Odo responds by
pointing out that the Founders are also responsible for a war that has killed
millions. WV-Six reveals a stunning fact: the Founders are dying from a
sickness that is spreading rapidly through their ranks.
