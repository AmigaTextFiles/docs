        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #1@{ub}

Aefvadh (be welcome) to the first of Major Rakal's Romulan Reviews. Part
"card of the day," part "deck of the week," and part strategy guide, my
reviews will cover individual cards, effective combos, deck ideas, mission
selection, and general strategy, and will have a decidedly "green"
slant--as in green-blooded and green-bordered. Yes, this series will focus
on the forgotten affiliation, our friends the Romulans. Using my own
ranking system, which considers supply and demand of skills within each
affiliation, I'll cover not only Romulan but also non-aligned personnel,
examining their relative usefulness in augmenting decks of different
affiliations and recommending "Best Bets" for Rommie decks. The same for
ships.

But don't worry, there will be plenty of interest to the Klingons and Feds
as well. For missions, I'll look at point/cost ratios, and how they vary
between affiliations for multi-color ones. For dilemmas, artifacts, events,
and interrupts, I'll compare the value of a card *to* each affiliation, and
where appropriate, its value used *against* each affiliation.

For my first review, I've selected one of the new QC Romulans, IMO the Most
Valuable Personnel in a green deck right now. No, it's *not* Sirol, though
he's close. The honors go to...


    @{b}TARIS@{ub}

    Rare Romulan personnel

    Integrity 6, Cunning 8, Strength 7, Command star

    OFFICER: Archaeology, MEDICAL, Music, Transporter Skill

@{i}"Female subcommander. Captain of the Warbird Haakona. Investigated the
Federation incursion of the Neutral Zone in the vicinity of Iconia."@{ui}


She's about 2/3 of a Jean-Luc Picard. And for the Romulans, that's saying a
*lot.* She has OFFICER, Archaeology, and Music in common with the good
Captain. Navigation is replaced by Transporter Skill, likely to prove quite
valuable to nullify Anti-Matter Pods, even if you never need it against
beaming interferences. No Honor, but no Treachery either, so she can get an
Integrity boost from D'Tan from a comfortable 6 to a highly-respectable 7.
No Diplomacy or Leadership, either; but both are common enough amongst
other Romulans, and Leadership is largely redundant to an OFFICER anyway.

And these lacks are more than compensated for by her MEDICAL skill
(second-listed, so immune to Tsiolkovsky Infection and Rascals). Finally, a
Romulan doctor with other useful skills and decent stats! Until now we've
had to get by with Takket (Exobiology, OK but that's all) and Vekor
(slightly more useful with SCIENCE, Navigation, and almost useless
Geology), the holographic Jera being virtually useless to the
holodeck-deficient Romulans. Both are Firestorm and Thought Fire fuel
without Lower Decks and D'Tan, as well as Hunter Gangs bait; Taris is
immune to all three.

And while she helps run the Genetronic Replicator (which she could do alone
with a Medical Kit) and get you by so many planet dilemmas, she also makes
a new cornerstone of the popular Romulan Archaeology deck. With the new
Plague Planet mission you can do a six-planet deck with Archaeology at
every one.

But there's more. Romulans can now get a piece of the Ressikan Flute, which
until now might as well have had a blue border. Add Galen (who also
complements the Archaeology deck nicely) and maybe Amarie. Heck, Data's
Body if you can get the head to go with it. Stir well. 10-20 points, *and*
it keeps your Fed opponent from playing *his* Flute (not duplicatable).

Want more? A big boost toward getting past Matriarchal Society for the
predominantly male Romulans. With the same stats (+1 Strength) as Ocett and
duplicating her OFFICER + Archaeology, Taris will probably displace her
from a lot of decks where she was almost a necessity to augment the one
useful universal and 3 unique females.

And finally, one "skill" dictated not by Taris' card but by the Haakona's
lore "Subcommander Taris' warbird," deemed close enough by Decipher to
qualify her for Captain's Log benefits.

And this card has a *green* border??

The Major's Combos:

- Taris + Haakona + Captain's Log.  8-12-11
- The above + Major Rakal + Roga Danar + Ira Graves + Kurlan Naiskos.
  24-36-33. Go get an outpost. Throw in Plasmadyne Relay + Bynars and anything
  bigger than a Scout Ship, and you can take out a Borg Ship.
- Taris + Toreth + Mirasta Yale. Just for the heck of it.

Aefvadh! Today let's take a look at a mission that looks like a real loser.

    @{b}SAMARITAN SNARE@{ub}

    Rare Space Mission

    Fed/Kli/Rom/Non, 15 points, Span 3

    ENGINEER + Discard one Equipment card

    Federation must attempt mission if present.

@{i}"Rhomboid Dronegar Sector: Respond to distress call from Pakled ship."@{ui}

So what good is a 15 point mission? One that makes you discard something,
and *anyone* can do it? And they had the nerve to make it rare! Well, that
little line of text under the mission requirements gives it away: like the
Pakleds, this is primarily a nuisance to the Federation. But there are
other ways that good Imperial citizens of both types can use this. Read on.

Obvious use: stall a Fed opponent. If they miscalculate and have to stop
there, they *must* attempt the mission, facing dilemmas and Q-Flashes for a
possible gain of only 15 points. I say possible, because a good Fed deck
should have lots of ENGINEERs and MEDICALs, and isn't nearly as likely as
Romulans or Klingons to be using typical equipment. To make it even more of
a nuisance, leave an Anti-Matter Pod there.

How to get them there:
- Paxan "Wormhole" (relocate their ship if no android aboard; not so good
  since they probably have Data).
- Real Wormholes (drop them right on it).
- Subspace Warp Rift (they can choose between getting their ship damaged,
  or having to try the Snare). Requires strategic placement.
- Gaps in Normal Space (choose between getting someone killed, or the
  Snare). Requires strategic placement.
- Birth of "Junior" or Baryon Buildup to reduce their range till they can't
  get by without stopping.
- Or how about a really simple one--park your non-Fed ship there and play a
  Hail as they try to get by.

Dilemmas to Use: Anything that won't stop the crew, because if they get
stopped they can leave on their next turn. Good candidates: Tarellian
Plague Ship + REM Fatigue Hallucinations, Bendii Syndrome, Frame of Mind,
The Higher...The Fewer (makes the mission even less worthwhile), Yuta,
Nitrium Metal Parasites, Quantum Singularity Lifeforms (with a Romulan ship
parked there). Or how about just a Borg Ship? A Q-Flash will also work if
you're careful not to use Q-Continuum cards that stop the crew.

Not-so-obvious uses for Imperial citizens: Your opponent is not likely to
load this with tough dilemmas. Feds won't want to chance getting stuck
facing their own hard dilemmas, or worse, a Q-Flash; and no one will think
it's worthwhile to do much booby-trapping of a lousy 15-pointmission. And
Romulan and Klingon opponents aren't likely to spend their time trying to
"steal" it. Plan on an expendable equipment card in your deck.
- "We are smart. We look for dilemmas. Dilemmas to get us points." Seed
  your own point dilemmas to make it worthwhile to do. Barclay's
  Protomorphosis Disease + Cosmic String Fragment + Nanites gives you a 40
  point mission. Note that it has a yellow affiliation bar--your non-aligneds
  can do this one alone.
- Easy mission for a Cryosatellite.

Or, use it as a decoy. If your opponent reads this review and does load it
with dilemmas, that's fewer dilemmas for the missions you *really* planned
to do.

The Major's Combos:

- Samaritan Snare + a Fed opponent + Hail

- Samaritan Snare + the listed point dilemmas

Aefvadh! How about something for your Q-Continuum?

    @{b}MANDARIN BAILIFF@{ub}

    Common Q Dilemma
    +/- X points

Opponent takes one personnel present (random selection) into custody (as
a captive) unless you "post bail" by transferring X points to opponent,
where X = the number of [red dot] icons in that personnel's skill box.

It's easy to think of dilemmas, events, and interrupts as affiliation-
neutral as long as they don't say "If a Romulan ship is present..." or
"Plays on a Klingon...". But the differences are often more subtle than
that. Just how many of those little red dots can you expect to find on a
random personnel card?

                        Number of Personnel
Number of dots  Fed     Kli     Rom     Non
        1       25      16       7       6
        2       24      14      15      14
        3       20       4       9       8
        4        6       8       2      11
        5        5       2       1       1
        6        1       0       0       1
                __      __      __      __
                81      44      34      41

average dots    2.3     2.2     2.3     2.8

Hmmm. Aside from revealing the glaring discrepancies in numbers of
available personnel, what does this tell us? That on average, a random
affiliated personnel will have the same number of red dots regardless of
affiliation. So much for statistics. The fact is, there's nothing random
about the personnel you have in your deck (well, I *hope* that's not the
way you chose them). Let's take a slightly different tack.

The Feds have tons of personnel with 3 dots or less. This *doesn't* make
it more likely that the Bailiff will pick one from a Fed Away Team, for
the simple reason that most Fed decks above beginner level will be using
no commons (except maybe Scotty) and few, if any, uncommons--bridge crew
is the name of the game. And the high-dot Fed cards are concentrated in
the rares. How many personnel with more than 3 dots does each
affiliation have?
        Fed - 12        Kli - 10        Rom - 3
Add in the non-aligned personnel that are most likely to find use in
each kind of deck (Fed, 6; Kli, 11; Rom, 10; my subjective evaluations
and no, I'm not going to list them!) and you have totals of:
        Fed - 18        Kli - 21        Rom - 13
Note that no one would be using all of the "likely" high-dot non-
aligneds for their affiliations; this is simply the maximum that they
have to choose from.

Conclusions:
1.  The odds are much higher for a Romulan deck that the selected
personnel will have 3 or fewer dots. First, the other affiliations
simply have a lot more that they are likely to use. Second, with so many
multi-skilled personnel, Feds can make a much "tighter" crew, less
likely to be diluted with 2's and 3's (or even 1's) to cover needed
skills as the Romulans and Klingons must do.

2.  A Fed personnel is more likely to be a 5 or 6 (6 available, Klingons
have 4, Romulans 3).

3.  The more skills (usually, dots) each personnel has, the fewer
personnel you are likely to have, the harder it will be to let one go as
a captive, and the more likely that you will risk the points to bail
them out. If you have a lot of personnel with only 2 skills, losing one
isn't so critical.

4.  Most likely point differential resulting from posting bail:
        Federation      8-12 points (4, 5, or 6 dots)
        Klingon         6-8 points (3 or 4 dots)
        Romulan         4-6 points (2 or 3 dots)
Advantage: Romulan. Depending on who gets picked, it might not even be
worth posting bail. Is there anyone who wouldn't post 12 points to get
back Jean-Luc?

The Major's Combos:

- Mandarin Bailiff + Interrogation in Q's Tent: If they won't post bail,
  get some points anyway.

- Mandarin Bailiff + Major Rakal: 3 Romulan skills, only 2 dots.  :)

Major Rakal's Romulan Review #4

Aefvadh! I've been seeing a lot of requests for dilemma combos. So
today, instead of a card review, let's have a little change of pace with

DILEMMA STRATEGY, PART 1

Dilemmas can be classified into a few major types by their effects.

1. Killers. May kill one, several, or all personnel; randomly, by
   opponent's choice, or by your choice.
2. Skill removers. Include dilemmas that directly drain skills, as well
   as those that stop, disable, take captive, or otherwise prevent the use
   of personnel without killing them (e.g., Love Interests).
3. "Wall" dilemmas. Require some combination of skills and/or attributes
   to get past.
4. Ship damage and destruction.
5. Point suckers. They drain your points and/or add to your opponent's
   score.
6. Miscellaneous. May delay mission attempts, cause you to lose cards,
   or have other nuisance effects.

Most dilemmas are relatively ineffective if used alone, or without
regard to effective combinations. Some have little effect if faced by
large, highly-skilled Away Teams; the effects of others can be minimized
by redshirting with expendable personnel. Since the main purpose of
dilemmas is to prevent or delay your opponent from completing his
missions, you need to combine dilemmas in such a way that either
approach carries risks.

One common strategy is to place killer and skill remover dilemmas first,
followed by wall dilemmas. (When I refer to placement order for
dilemmas, I am always referring to the order in which they will be
encountered. So "place first" means seed last.) One example would be
Female's Love Interest followed by Matriarchal Society; remove one
female, hoping there will not be two left to get past the Matriarchal
Society. Unfortunately, if your opponent did not have any females in the
Away Team, the Female's Love Interest card is completely wasted.

This strategy has other problems. Many of the killers and skill removers
are not very selective. Armus - Skin of Evil will always kill one
personnel (barring a well-manned Genetronic Replicator), but if that
personnel was a common, universal, expendable redshirt, and the
personnel with the skills to complete the mission are back on the ship
waiting until it's safe to beam down, you haven't accomplished much. And
dilemmas that kill a whole Away Team or a significant portion of it are
more or less wasted if encountered by a 1- or 2-person team.

A corollary to this strategy says that you should *not* place a wall
dilemma at a mission with similar requirements. Don't place Impassable
Door, for example, which requires Computer Skill to pass, at Sensitive
Search, which requires Computer Skill + CUNNING>28, because your
opponent will be certain to have Computer Skill present in order to do
the mission. True, but will he want to risk that Computer Skill against
killer dilemmas, or will he try to keep him safe on the ship? If you
require him to bring in his Computer Skill in order to get past the
Impassable Door, you may be able to eliminate him before completing the
mission.

So...use the reverse strategy. Simply place a wall dilemma first, to
ensure a minimum of 2 or 3 personnel present, preferably valuable ones,
to be killed or disabled by one or more followup dilemmas.

For example, place Matriarchal Society first, and Female's Love Interest
second. If the initial Away Team does not include two females, you have
stalled your opponent for a while; just how long depends on how many
females are in his deck. Once he gets past Matriarchal Society, he loses
one female. Guaranteed. (With the remotely possible exception that this
is the *only* planet mission on the spaceline.) For a finely-tuned
Federation deck with a minimum of highly-skilled bridge crew for
personnel, the loss of Beverly Crusher or Picard, or one of the Tasha
Yars, can be a perfect setup for a final killer requiring MEDICAL +
SECURITY, like Barclay's Protomorphosis Disease or Microvirus. Against
Klingons, you may take out a critical MEDICAL (Vekma or Kahlest) or
Kurak with her important Astrophysics. And against Romulans, you may get
the even more critical Major Rakal (the Rommies' best bet for Empathy
and Tal Shiar), Sela (Diplomacy), or Taris (MEDICAL). Follow up with any
killers requiring MEDICAL or Empathy to overcome.

There are lots of Planet wall dilemmas to choose from for your setup.
Malfunctioning Door, Hidden Entrance, Hologram Ruse, and Alien Parasites
are all virtually certain to get 4 or more personnel into place for the
killers. Alien Labyrinth, Impassable Door, Matriarchal Society, Security
Precautions, Portal Guard, Wind Dancer, and Zaldan may net you only one
or two, but they're likely to be a higher quality one or two than your
average redshirt team. What's that--you didn't know Alien Parasites was
a wall dilemma? Look again. No "discard dilemma." If the Away Team has
the Integrity, it also has a minimum of 4 personnel; if it doesn't, you
get to play around with the team, and then the dilemma still doesn't go
away.

For Space-only wall dilemmas we have only one, both rare and relatively
weak: Ancient Computer. But it is still likely to get some of your
opponent's better personnel into position for the killers. In addition,
you have a few Planet/Space dilemmas to choose from: Outpost Raid (if
not at an outpost), Android Nightmares, Empathic Echo, and Thought Fire,
all relatively weak as wall dilemmas, and my personal favorite, Shaka,
When the Walls Fell.

My next review will look more closely at Shaka, and the best ways to
follow it up, including relative effectiveness against the three
affiliations.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #5@{ub}

Aefvadh! Last time, I said my personal favorite wall dilemma was Shaka,
When The Walls Fell. Let's take a look at why.


    @{b}SHAKA, WHEN THE WALLS FELL@{ub}


    Uncommon Dilemma, Planet or Space

    Must have 2 Diplomacy and CUNNING>30 to communicate and proceed.

@{i}"'Shaka, when the walls fell," means inability to understand. The
incomprehensible Tamarians spoke entirely in metaphors."@{ui}


First, it's both Planet and Space. You'll *always* have a place to use
it, and it works well in combination with a number of followup killers.

Second, it virtually guarantees your opponent will have to bring in a
minimum of 4 personnel to meet the CUNNING requirement. For Klingons,
it's more likely to take 5 or 6. Romulans will have the easiest time
with this with their high Cunning. Feds fall in between.

Third, and most important, two of those personnel will have Diplomacy.
Why is that so crucial? Because NO common, universal personnel, and NO
holographic personnel, have Diplomacy. So with rare exceptions, you'll
always get two uncommon or rare, unique personnel laying their lives on
the line. Not only can this dilemma stall your opponent, he may just
abandon the mission attempt rather than risk valuable personnel.

The exceptions: Jean-Luc Picard, Dathon, Sarek, Riva, Pardek, and Ves
Alkar each have Diplomacy x2. It's doubtful that you'll encounter Riva;
Ves Alkar has to have at least one female Empath with him to have the
Diplomacy x2, so you automatically have a second valuable personnel at
risk; and the rest, especially Jean-Luc, would all be worthwhile kills.
Dathon is a special case: because he nullifies Tamarian-related
dilemmas, your opponent could pass this with Dathon alone. But then he'd
be a sitting duck for the next dilemma, so he probably won't be alone.

Now that you've got them there, what next? I recommend a minimum of two
killers/disablers to follow. Remember that two of the personnel will be
diplomats, who won't contribute much in the way of classifications or
skills to overcoming other dilemmas; but your opponent will probably
supply a minimum of one each MEDICAL, SECURITY, and SCIENCE to make up
the required CUNNING>30. Notes on a few of the more useful dilemmas:

- Hunter Gangs (P). Most effective against Romulans, then Klingons and
  Feds.
- Chalnoth (P) and Nagilum (S). Precede with Interphasic Plasma
  Creatures to cut STRENGTH.
- Ferengi Attack (P). Precede with IP Creatures and/or Brain Drain.
- Zaldan (P). This one was *made* for Shaka because it targets
  Diplomats. Precede with something to excise a critical Treachery (for
  Romulans) or Exobiology (all affiliations).
- Rascals (S). Targets uniques. Most will lose their Diplomacy. Few
  crews will have two unaffected MEDICAL *and* Biology left, especially
  Klingons.
- Cardassian Trap (P/S). Targets uniques and gives you a captive.
- Thought Fire (P/S). Requires the Traveler to trigger. Useless against
  Feds; kills most Klingon and Romulan universals (who see heavy use for
  MEDICAL and SECURITY), the Duras family, and many unique Romulans, plus
  many otherwise useful non-aligneds. Won't kill the diplomats, but can
  clean out MEDICAL and SECURITY for non-Feds.
- Yuta (P/S). For best effect, memorize a few key "Yuta numbers" for
  Diplomats.
     Fed: 11 matches Picard, Deanna Troi (or Major Rakal), Rachel
     Garrett, and Riva; Sarek is 16, Riker 8, Worf 4.
     Klingon: Gowron and Kurn are 6, Gov. Worf 7, K'mpec 10.
     Romulan: Major Rakal and Sirol are 8, Sela 7, Pardek 6, Cmdr.
     Tomalak 5, Tomalak 4.
     Non-aligned: Dathon and Maques 11, Devinoni Ral 9, Evek 5.
- Q-Flash (P/S). Fill your Q-Continuum with cards such as Incoming
  Message-The Continuum, The Higher...The Q-Er, Door-Net (they're not
  likely to have any Diplomacy in their hand by now), Penalty Box,
  Mandarin Bailiff, Jealous Amanda, His Honor The High Sheriff of
  Nottingham, Scottish Setter, and Pla-Net.

The Major's Combos: (dilemmas should be encountered in the listed order)

Space:
- Shaka + Tarellian Plague Ship + Rascals
- Shaka + Interphasic Plasma Creatures + Nagilum
- Shaka + Two-Dimensional Creatures + Thought Fire

Planet:
- Shaka + IP Creatures + Chalnoth (or Ferengi Attack) + Zaldan
- Shaka + Armus + Alien Abduction
- Shaka + Male's Love Interest + Hunter Gangs
- Shaka + Q-Flash + Male's Love Interest

Either:
- Shaka + Frame of Mind + Cardassian Trap
- Shaka + Yuta + Barclay's Protomorphosis Disease
- Shaka + Q-Flash + Barclay's Protomorphosis Disease

Now where did the Diplomacy go that I needed for that mission?

Aefvadh! I hope everyone had a great holiday season. It's time to look

instead, we are going to go

LOOKING FOR SHIPS IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES

Uncommon Romulan Ship, Merchant Class
Range 8, Weapons 7, Shields 6
Staffing Requirements: 1 Staff
May report for duty at Qualor II. Tractor beam.


Three ships, three affiliations, all have in common the ability--or
requirement--to report somewhere other than (usually) an outpost. Sounds
like that could be be useful, but is it?

Enterprise-C seems, at first glance, to have a lot going for her. She
can report to any location. Good for rescues, or for staffing from a
Cryosatellite (Rachel Garrett, Beverly Picard, and Tasha Yar-Alternate
give you OFFICER, ENGINEER, MEDICAL, and SECURITY; beam over a SCIENCE
from the crew that just completed the mission and you have a nice
secondary core crew), or with a Devidian Door/Ophidian Cane. Perhaps the
most obvious advantage is those last four words in the lore; get Rachel
Garrett aboard and you can get Captain's Log benefits. 8-10-11 isn't bad
at all; for that matter, the base 8-7-8 is pretty respectable. Only one
catch. This ship's base stats are actually only 5-7-8, due to the
"damage" that you pay for the ability to report anywhere. So unless you
forgo that ability and report her to the outpost, and THEN wait two full
turns to repair the damage, she's not going anywhere very fast without
either a Plasmadyne relay or an Exocomp aboard. Add to that the heavy
three-staff requirement, including an AU icon, and the ship's own AU
icon (requiring that you have an open AU Doorway), and the poor
Enterprise-C doesn't look so inviting any more. You'll be better off
with the non-AU Phoenix or Stargazer (plus a shield enhancer), both of
which require only one Command and one Staff, and both of which are
eligible for Captain's Log as well.

The T'Ong, on the other hand, at first glance doesn't look so hot.
Weapons and Shields are so-so--equal to a standard K'Vort--but the Range
of 5 won't let it keep up with a K'Vort fleet, and it can't even be
"repaired" to a higher Range like the Enterprise-C. It's highly
susceptible to Baryon Buildups. It has no tractor beam for towing
Garbage Scows. And instead of reporting anywhere, it's restricted to the
ends of the spaceline. But look at the advantages: It's not AU. Staffing
requirement is minimal. Damage won't *affect* its range. And most
important, the ship is a mini-Red Alert. Four cards played for one turn,
you don't need anything else in play first, and no AU restrictions on
the personnel. Uses once in play? Aside from possible Love Interest
rescues, let them join a K'Vort armada and beam or Devidian Door a
Plasmadyne Relay aboard. And although K'Temok doesn't exist *yet*,
chances are someday soon the T'Ong will get Captain's Log benefits too.

That leaves the T'Pau. What can I say about this ship? She has decent
stats, better than a Science Vessel, with minimal staffing required (one
Staff star), so she could lead a Science Vessel armada. The mediocre
shields are easily enhanced. She can tow Garbage Scows. And she can
report at your outpost if you so desire. Which is a good thing, because
for the life of me, I can't figure out why you would want to report her
at Qualor II. Any Romulans you have there are either already on a ship,
or in stasis and unable to beam aboard, and non-aligneds can't fly her.
Besides that, no Captain's Log benefits are possible. If only this ship
had been made universal, she would be the Romulans' answer to the
K'Vorts. No dice, she's unique.

Final analysis? Depends on what you're looking for (speed, battle
ability, versatility, mission-solving), and of course, which affiliation
you'd like to play, but all in all I'd rate the Enterprise-C and the
T'Ong about equal in play value, though for very different reasons, with
the T'Pau way behind.

The Major's Combos:

- Enterprise-C + (Rachel Garrett + Beverly Picard + Tasha Yar-Alt on a
  Cryosatellite) + Captain's Log
- I.K.C. Tong + Plasmadyne Relay + a Klingon Commander
- Taris + Haakona + Captain's Log

Aefvadh! Looks like I've been neglecting personnel in my reviews, not
having covered any since starting off with Taris. So let's take a look
at a personnel card that *doesn't* have a green border, but sure looks
like it should...


    @{b}GALEN@{ub}

@{i}"Jean-Luc Picard went undercover in 2370 posing as a mercenary and
artifact smuggler."@{ui} [The name "Jean-Luc Picard" is in boldface,
indicating Picard and Galen are the same persona.]

Rare Non-Aligned Personnel
Integrity 5, Cunning 8, Strength 6, Command star
SCIENCE: Archaeology, Computer Skill, Treachery, Leadership, Navigation,
Music
Does not work with Federation affiliation.


Finally, a Picard with 6 skills for "the rest of us." How does he
compare to Jean-Luc? His SCIENCE classification is much more useful than
OFFICER to Romulans, who have hordes of OFFICERs and a dearth of SCIENCE
(only one with Integrity >4), and with his skill of Leadership, he can
lead a battle anyway. Besides Leadership, he retains his valuable skills
of Archaeology, Navigation, and Music, while Computer Skill and
Treachery replace Diplomacy x2 (plenty of Rommie Diplomats) and Honor
(well, it would have been nice). He loses 4 points of Integrity, but is
still safe from Firestorm, Thought Fire, and Hunter Gangs. (For now, you
don't even have to worry about Bendii Syndrome draining his Integrity,
since all Vulcans so far are Fed, and he won't work with them.)

Galen's a perfect complement for Taris in a Romulan Archaeology-
Treachery deck. Though these decks are popular because of the two
Universals with these two skills, until Q-C we haven't had any green
Archaeologists with other particularly useful skills (yes, Taul's
SECURITY, but just how many of those do you need?). With D'Tan for an
Integrity boost, you have enough Archaeology for even Hunt for DNA
Program, with two Musics in case you want to drop a Ressikan Flute under
one of those historical digs.

Other uses? His Navigation is a big help for Anti-Matter Pod and FGC-47
Research, not to mention several space dilemmas. Music will get you by
Crystalline Entity in a small ship, or the odd Wind Dancer. And if you
want to throw Qualor II Rendezvous into your deck, he's one of the few
Non-aligned personnel who will be just as useful for the rest of your
deck as he will be on Qualor II.

How does he stack up in a Klingon deck? Not as valuable here, because
the Klingons have a greater supply vs. demand of all his skills except
SCIENCE. And even with a higher demand for SCIENCE, Klingons have more
*useful* SCIENCE than the Romulans--Kitrik, J'Ddan, Koroth, and Kurak
all have other useful skills and most have high Integrity. On a
preliminary version of a personnel rating scale that takes into account
skill supply and demand within each affiliation, Galen rates 78 for the
Romulans (where Taris is 86 and Sirol 77), and only 61 for the Klingons
(compared to 70 for Kitrik and 60 for Governor Worf). Yes, Galen is
definitely happiest as an honorary Romulan.

And besides all that, it's a *much* better image of Patrick Stewart than
the distorted closeup on J-L.

The Major's Combos:

- Galen + Taris + D'Tan + Taul. Get me a pick and shovel!

Aefvadh! While we're on the subject of personnel, how about that new
Security fella,


    @{b}TELAK@{ub}

"Male bodyguard of Sela. Stationed on Romulus. Lieutenant operative in
the Tal Shiar's new Android Research section."

Uncommon Romulan Personnel
Integrity 5, Cunning 6, Strength 9, Staff star
SECURITY: Treachery, Tal Shiar, Cybernetics

Our first unique Romulan SECURITY. Though one point less Cunning than
his universal comrades Jaron and Taul, he makes up for it with that
critical extra Integrity point that lets him escape Firestorms, and the
even Cunning protects him from Hunter Gangs. He's still vulnerable to
Thought Fire unless you augment his Cunning with a PADD or Yellow Alert
(though the latter negates his Hunter Gangs immunity).

SECURITY is a must for dilemmas (especially with the new Security
Precautions), but it's not required for missions (with the sole
exception of the 25-point Fed-Kli Hostage Situation just out in the new
2-Player Game), so you must make them do double duty through skills, not
an easy job for the Rommies. Jaron is good only for Youth decks, unless
you're fond of the 20-point Relief Mission. Taul is a staple in
Archaeology decks. And that's all they're good for. Telak, on the other
hand, now provides a crucial backup Tal Shiar for the good Major, making
Quash Conspiracy less risky (not to mention possible using Uncommon
personnel), as well as helping out as a leader for Romulan-Romulan
attacks. Cybernetics (the only other source of which, for Romulans, is
Ira Graves) will let you report Soong-type Androids, with their
selectable classification, "for free". So although his skills are only
good for one mission requirement, they're also useful in other ways.

Bottom line: no Roga Danar, but a lot more useful than the other Rommie
SECURITY, and only Uncommon.

The Major's Combos:

- Telak + Major Rakal + Quash Conspiracy

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #9@{ub}


Aefvadh! Time for another dilemma, and this is a nasty one.


    @{b}THE SHELIAK@{ub}


    Rare Dilemma, Planet

Place at far end of spaceline. End of every turn, moves toward this
mission (RANGE = 6). Upon arrival, destroys any outposts, stations and
Away Teams present. Mission then = zero points.

@{i}"A reclusive race of strict legalists that considers humanoids inferior.
Life-form classification R-3. The 2255 Treaty of Armens ceded several
planets to the Sheliak."@{ui}


More relentless than the Borg Ship, The Sheliak at present cannot be
stopped. Nothing nullifies it; a Q-Net can't stop it; it's not a ship so
it can't be damaged or destroyed. Even if you somehow got the chance to
rearrange the spaceline (if your opponent hit your Q dilemma) before it
got to your mission, it won't singlemindedly continue in the same
direction and off the end, like the Borg Ship; it always moves "toward
this mission," and so would reverse direction if necessary. And it may
move even faster than the Borg Ship, as its range of 6 will often let it
move two missions instead of one every turn. Though it won't destroy
ships or attack anything else along the way, it does two things a Borg
Ship can't do: it destroys outposts and Away Teams, and it hoses the
mission points if you fail to complete it before The Sheliak arrive.

So your opponent turns up The Sheliak. If you were able to seed it at
the center of the spaceline, it has to traverse six missions, which will
take from three to six moves. Since it moves at the end of every turn,
this could take up to two more of your opponent's turns after the
current one. So you need to (1) keep him from completing the mission,
and (2) keep him from leaving. Seed The Sheliak so it is encountered
first, or if you prefer to be certain of tying up (and hopefully
killing) a few personnel, put it after Shaka, When The Walls Fell or any
other wall dilemma. Follow up The Sheliak (which doesn't stop the Away
Team, so they have to continue) with another wall dilemma or other
stopper (Alien Parasites, Hyper-Aging, Parallel Romance, Phased Matter,
Worshiper, Chinese Finger Puzzle, Outpost Raid). Or maybe a Q-Flash,
with a Q Continuum loaded with cards like The Higher...The Q-Er
(experience even more Q cards), Go Back Whence Thou Camest (take his
ship away), and His Honor, The High Sheriff of Nottingham (should he
lose points, or take a chance on getting back a captive who may be
promptly killed by The Sheliak? Use with Cardy Traps, Mandarin Bailiff,
etc.).

If you can't slow him down and despite your best efforts he completes
the mission, you should at least try to keep him on the planet. You
could Temporal Rift his ship, or tow it away with Ship Seizure if empty,
or play a Particle Scattering Field on your own Tama and move it in. Two
interlocking Distortion Fields will prevent him from beaming anyone out.

Or you can use the simplest combo, and follow up The Sheliak with our
old friend Q. Unless he's got more than 60 Integrity (and 2 Leadership),
his Away Team is stopped and stranded on the planet--which you, of
course, will relocate next to The Sheliak, which will move in when he
ends his turn and destroy the Away Team and the mission points. It is
imperative that you have Amanda Rogers in hand, in case he has Q2.

I'd recommend one more dilemma or Q-Flash after Q, just in case he
manages the Integrity (Feds might), or has more than one Q2; or in case
he has seeded an artifact there, which he can still get later by
completing the mission normally (he just won't get any points for the
mission).

The Major's Combos:

- Against red-shirters: Shaka + The Sheliak + Q

- Against massive Away Teams: The Sheliak + Q + Q-Flash

- Just want to keep him from getting points? The Sheliak +
  The Higher... The Fewer + Edo Probe + Q

- Don't have Q? Try Shaka + The Sheliak + Hyper-Aging + Temporal Rift

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #10@{ub}


Aefvadh! And welcome...to the Tal Shiar Barbershop.

It seems that in recent weeks, complaints have been abnormally high
about how supposedly inferior the Romulan affiliation is to the Klingons
and Feds. We won't deny that they are under-developed in comparison (and
we'd be more than happy to see a few green premium cards to go along
with the blue and red ones in the 2-Player Games), but we'd say they are
an even match in the hands of the right player.

In fact, the thought struck Mot that the way people are talking about
the Romulans, you'd think they were a "useless affiliation." Well, Mot
loves debunking the "useless card" adage, so he decided to devote a
Useless Card Review to Romulan superiority, which led, logically, to a
proposal of collaboration with the Major. We herewith present the first
joint venture of the Tal Shiar and the Barber's Guild,

TEN THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN THEY LAUGH AT YOUR ROMULAN DECK

STRENGTH AND CUNNING. On the average, the Romulans are every bit as
strong as the Klingons. (In fact, if you remove Fek'lhr from the
equation, Romulans are actually stronger!) They aren't lacking in
CUNNING like the rather dim Klingons, however. In fact, more Romulans
have a CUNNING of 8 or better than any other affiliation, at 55%.
Klingons can only muster a pathetic 9%, and even the Feds barely top
37%. The list of cards requiring CUNNING or STRENGTH is quite extensive,
far longer than INTEGRITY. (And that includes Shaka, When the Walls
Fell.) Even Explore Typhone Expanse, with a requirement of CUNNING>50,
takes on average only 7 Romulans, but 9 or 10 Klingons. Or, you can meet
the alternative requirements with a lot fewer personnel; the Romulans
have a lot of...

EASY HIGH POINT MISSIONS. The Romulans have the only 40 point mission
that can be completed by a single personnel (Quash Conspiracy), and two
personnel capable of completing it (Telak, Major Rakal). What's more,
they have more high point missions that can be completed by one or two
personnel than any other affiliation: Covert Installation, Explore
Typhone Expanse, Extraction, Investigate Raid, and Study Lonka Pulsar.
Most of the high point missions for the other affiliations have
requirements in STRENGTH, CUNNING or INTEGRITY, making it necessary to
have a lot more personnel. Get to those missions quickly with...

FAST SHIPS. Not one Romulan ship has a RANGE of less than 8. Compare
this to the Federation, loaded with 6's and 7's. And many Romulan ships
have a RANGE of 9 or better, but only the Enterprise and Future
Enterprise manage this for the Feds. You can play missions with high
ranges, and get around much faster than the average Federation opponent,
or even a Klingon player using K'Vorts instead of Vor'chas. And to
enhance your other ship stats, try...

CAPTAIN'S LOG BENEFITS. The Romulans currently have five ships eligible
for Captain's Log benefits, complete with the captains to match.
(Devoras/Mendak, Haakona/Taris, Khazara/Toreth, Decius/Tomalak,
Terix/Sirol) That's more than any other affiliation. The Klingons and
the Federation only have four, and the Non-aligned personnel add only
three more. You're likely to have at least two matching Romulan pairs in
any Romulan deck you build, meaning it may be worth your while to
include the Captain's Log. You don't have to go out of your way to get
these benefits, as you might playing another affiliation. (When is the
last time you played with Kargan or Benjamin Maxwell?) Now that you have
your ships beefed up, try a little...

ESPIONAGE. Only the Romulans have the ability to commit espionage on
both the other affiliations. At the same time, they're immune to having
it done to them. That means ultimately that ANY mission (except Qualor
II) is fair game for them if you are willing to include the cards. Pick
any one skill, and you'll easily find six missions for it if you think
in terms of espionage. A deck that tightly focused on one or two skills
will require fewer personnel, allowing room for the Espionage cards (and
the Q2s or Rishon Uxbridges to protect them). Of course, with Espionage
goes...

TREACHERY. Even without Espionage, it's easy to build a tightly focused
Romulan deck, and the easiest skill to focus on is Treachery. 41% of
Romulans share this skill, which is required on 11 different Romulan
missions. This gives a greater skill requirement overlap than any other
affiliation. Even among those Honorable Klingons, only 36% have Honor--
and only 5 Klingon missions require it. You can easily build an all-
Treachery Romulan deck. What's more, you can get this kind of focus
using...

ALL-COMMON PERSONNEL DECKS. The Romulans have 25 missions that can be
done with all commons (the occasional non-aligned included, like Vekor
for Navigation), 19 of them without holos. Only four are worth 25 points
or less. 9 of the 25 require *only* Treachery, Archaeology, and Computer
Skill, all of which are readily available with commons; in fact,
Treachery/Archaeology decks seem to appear quite frequently. While the
Klingons have 31 missions that could be done by all commons (29 without
holos), there is no such skill overlap, and 7 are worth 25 points or
less. (I'm not counting the use of K'chiQ here, because although she's
common and universal, you can only use one in an Away Team or crew, and
she's too susceptible to losing her man.) Feds have 24 missions that
could be done by all commons, but 4 of those require the non-universal
Scotty, so you have no backup for his crucial skills; and 8 are worth 25
points or less (two are only 15 each). Again, there is no particular
skill overlap. An all-common deck means that a relative beginner with
few cards can still make a viable Romulan deck. It would be virtually
immune to Klim Dokachin, and with Lower Decks in play, not a single
common Romulan will die in a Firestorm or Thought Fire. Who needs
Thermal Deflectors? Of course, there are other dilemmas to consider,
such as...

QUANTUM SINGULARITY LIFEFORMS. This could be one of the worst cards for
the Romulans. It's also one of the best, when you turn it against your
opponent. Send a single personnel on a Science Vessel out to a space
location where an opponent's ship (ideally one loaded with personnel) is
parked. Attempt the mission there, releasing a Quantum Singularity
Lifeforms you yourself seeded there. The presence of your Romulan warp
core will put their entire crew into stasis. You can keep them there
most of the game while you attempt missions with the rest of your
personnel... or you can have an ENGINEER accompany an armada and "help
them out" by releasing their ship, into a barrage of disruptor fire. And
speaking of armadas, why not make it a...

SCIENCE GREED ARMADA. Say "armada" and everyone thinks "Klingon". But
you can also build a respectable Romulan Armada with--don't laugh!--
Science Vessels. With stats of 8-5-6 compared to the K'Vort's 8-6-6,
they could use a little Bynars help, but have *no* staffing
requirements; lead the fleet with an 8-7-6 single-staff-star T'Pau for
flavor. How does this make them superior, you ask? Just man your little
ships with Galathons, blow away your opponent's ships, and then hit them
with Latinum Payoffs (since Gally has Greed and is also OFFICER for a
battle leader). No one else has a universal Greedy OFFICER. Of course,
all those Galathons are actually good for something else, too--the
previously mentioned Treachery/Archaeology decks. And along with that,
he's useful for...

THE CHARYBDIS. Make artifact acquisition difficult for your opponent,
while being almost certain to walk away with your own--and his too, if
he has to leave them behind for lack of Archaeology. It's a particularly
effective strategy against Feds, who have only 4 Archaeologists, all
rare. Besides Galathon, the Romulans have the common Taul, who is
virtually certain to be in most Romulan decks anyway, in multiple, for
SECURITY, plus the uncommon D'Tan and rare Taris...and they can use
Galen as well.

There you have it, friends. What more reason could you need to switch to
the not-so-useless affiliation?

Aefvadh! Working with Mot on our joint "Useless" review made me think,
for some reason, of Romulan Ambush. Well, Mot said even he couldn't come
up with a way to make this card useful. You know what? Neither can I.


    @{b}ROMULAN AMBUSH@{ub}


    Uncommon Interrupt


Destroys opponent's ship with SHIELDS<6 present with your D'deridex-
class ship. Crew killed, except one personnel (your choice) is made
captive.

@{i}"In 2367, Geordi LaForge was captured by a Romulan ship while piloting a
shuttle to Risa. He was brainwashed into an assassination plot against
Klingon Governor Vagh."@{ui}


When I first saw this card, I thought, "Great! The Romulans finally have
a 'special' card like all the Klingon 'specials'. About time. Destroy a
ship, get a captive, do it on your opponent's turn, and your ship won't
even be stopped. You can even destroy another Romulan without Tal Shiar
around. What more could you want?" Mmm, how about a target?

The D'deridex-class ship is no problem. It includes all the warbirds,
including the universal, of course, which Romulans generally have no
trouble staffing with so many command stars available. So, just find an
opponent playing a ship with SHIELDS<6.

Federation:  Runabout (5)
             Type VI Shuttlecraft (2)
             U.S.S. Miranda (5)

No one plays with a Shuttlecraft, unless they're playing Engage Shuttle
Operations. In other words, no one plays with a Shuttlecraft. Why
bother? The Runabout is 7-5-5 to the Shuttlecraft's 6-2-2, with the same
no-staff-star requirement. No one plays with the Miranda, either; it's
worse than a Runabout (6-5-5) and requires a staff star to boot.

That leaves the Runabout. Occasionally used as a red-shirt vessel for
space missions; not much of a loss to a Borg Ship, and temporarily
expendable for a 15-point Cytherians trip with Mot (sorry, Mot!). Which
means it also won't be much of a loss to your Ambush. And its single
crewmember won't give you much "choice" of captive; almost certainly
useless for Brainwash, and not likely to be redeemed for 10
Interrogation points, though he could garner you a few single points.

Romulan:     Scout Vessel (3)
             Pi (4)

No one plays with a Scout Vessel, either generic (9-3-3) or the Scout-
class Pi (9-4-4). Use a Science Vessel (8-5-6) instead. No staff stars
need apply.

Klingon:     None. That's right. Every K'Vort is at least 6.

Non-aligned: Yridian Shuttle (3)
             Zibalian Transport (4)

No one plays with an Yridian Shuttle, unless they're playing Engage...
haven't we been here before? I suppose a Klingon *might* use a Zibalian
Transport if he was desperate for a no-staff ship.

Well, that was exhilarating. Two vague possibilities for actual use, and
either can be immunized against the Ambush with a simple Plasmadyne
Relay. And there are currently *no* cards that drain SHIELDS. To top it
off, four of the D'deridexes can destroy with a direct hit any of these
ships except the Runabout and the Miranda (though you get no captive,
must do it on your own turn, and will be stopped).

So your possible targets are:
1. Beginning players who own almost no ships.
2. Players of Engage Shuttle Operations.
3. Fed space mission redshirters.

Oh, and the concept isn't even true to the show; Geordi was taken
captive, but his shuttle wasn't destroyed.

@{i}"Ancient Vulcan telepathic weapon. Kills by magnifying aggressive and
violent thoughts, but can be blocked by peaceful thoughts."@{ui}


First, the limitations. It specifies an Away Team, so you can't use it
on a ship's crew. And you must somehow get your opponent's Away Team
stopped, because you can only play this on your own turn, barring a
serendipitous Manheim's Dimensional Door temporal hiccup. Finally, its
usefulness may be badly diminished by the presence of PADDs, Yellow
Alert, or Lower Decks.

Pluses: It can be used by Feds to kill without doing battle. It's
possible to drain CUNNING selectively with Brain Drain, and across the
board for Non-aligneds with the Humuhumu... fish card.

Unlike some artifacts, this one is very affiliation-dependent for its
effectiveness. How many personnel in each affiliation have CUNNING less
than 8 and no Youth? (I didn't count holos since they would reactivate
next turn anyway.)

Federation: 40 personnel (49%) will be killed, nearly all uncommon or
rare. Although many of the best bridge crew will survive (Picard,
Geordi, Data, Beverly), you will lose Deanna Troi or Major Rakal (likely
source of Empathy), both Tashas, and Worf (all your best SECURITY).

Klingon: 35 personnel, a whopping 80%, of the dim-witted Klingons will
be toast. This includes all but one common, and all SECURITY and MEDICAL
save Divok. Lower Decks won't even save most of them. Of rare Klingons,
Gov. Worf, Gowron, Kurak, and Kurn are among the dear departed. Good for
some Death Yells, but not much else.

Romulan: Ah, only *12* (35%) Romulans aren't bright enough or young
enough to live. Although this includes all SECURITY and MEDICAL except
Taris and the holo-Jera, Lower Decks (frequently used for a universal
Integrity boost) or even Yellow Alert will save most of them. Among rare
Romulans you will lose only the Tomalaks and Mendak; the much more
useful women will all survive.

Non-aligned: 17 (41%) will die, including Berlinghoff Rasmussen, Tarmin,
Zon, and Mortal Q (great way to keep your opponent from playing Immortal
Again to reopen his Q Continuum). But you can make it even worse by
playing Humuhumunukunukuapua'a on the Away Team's location before
playing the Gol Stone; it drains your opponent's non-aligneds of 4
CUNNING each, so the Stone will claim 83% of them (all but 7).

In summary, best used against Klingons, and Non-Aligneds with a Humu
fish; not as effective but still damaging to Federation; and much less
effective against Romulans. Appropriate, considering its origin.

Keep a Disruptor Overload around just in case your opponent favors
PADDs, and a Q2 in case he tries to KU the Stone. Oh, and to stop the
Away Team, try any wall dilemma.

The Major's Combos:

- Vulcan Stone of Gol + multiple Brain Drains + Humu fish

Aefvadh! Feel up to a little gambling? How about a game of...


    @{b}ROYALE CASINO: CRAPS@{ub}

    Uncommon Planet Dilemma, AU Icon, 7 Bonus Points

Show a personnel from hand. If CUNNING = 7 or 11 OR opponent cannot
match your number, win points. Otherwise, opponent wins points.

@{i}"An away team from the U.S.S. Enterprise was trapped in the illusionary
Hotel Royale until they won enough money in the casino to buy the bank
and their way out."@{ui}


Two ways to use this: for your opponent to encounter, or for yourself.
Like last time's Vulcan Stone of Gol, this is another affiliation-
dependent card, but this time we're looking for specific numbers instead
of something "greater than" a cutoff. Let's see who fares best.

Federation: 29 personnel, including 9 uncommons and 17 rares, have 7 or
11. Looks like they have a good chance of winning this one. Next most
common number is 8.

Klingon: Only 2 uncommons and 3 rares have 7, no 11's.  The Klingons
aren't likely to be able to pull one out of the hand. Most common
numbers are 5 and 6.

Romulan: 8 commons, 5 uncommons, and 3 rares beat the house. Although
that's not as many possibilities as the Federation, it might be easier
to hold back a duplicate common than for a Fed to hold back a bridge
crew. Remember, it has to come from your hand. Next most common number
is 8.

Non-aligned: Only 3 commons and 4 uncommons win here with a 7 or 11 in
your hand. Next most common number is, again, 8. But wait, there's one
more winner, even though his CUNNING is 5 and this one you *don't* want
in your hand. Mickey D., who "automatically wins Royale Casino
sidegames, if present." That means he must be in the Away Team that
encounters the dilemma.

So how will each affiliation fare, encountering this dilemma
unexpectedly? The Federation and Romulans both have excellent chances of
winning, as long as they haven't Red Alert-ed all their personnel onto
the table. The Klingons don't have much hope. Use this one offensively
only against Klingons, or other opponents who normally use Red Alert.
But it's imperative to be prepared by keeping a personnel in your hand
with 8 CUNNING (dead easy for Feds or Rommies, a Klingon will need to
hold a non-aligned), or a 5 and a 6 if playing against Klingons (easy
for Feds and Klingons, hard for Rommies without a non-aligned), because
if they don't have the requisite 7 or 11, you need to be able to match
whatever they *can* produce. (If they have no personnel in hand, you win
the points by default.)

To play it for your own benefit, of course, you want to seed it last, so
you will encounter it first. (Follow it up with a Sarjenka, so you can
choose to be stopped for another 5 points and abort the mission attempt,
if desired.) You can then either deliberately hold back a key CUNNING 7
personnel (feasible for Romulans and Feds), or do the simple thing, pull
Mickey D. out of your Q's Tent and play him before you attempt the
mission.

BTW, since the personnel you show is not in play, his CUNNING is
unaffected by PADDs, Lower Decks, or Yellow Alert.

The Major's Combos:

- Royale Casino: Craps + Mickey D. + Sarjenka + Parallax Arguers. 17
  easy points is pretty cool, I think.

Aefvadh! Here's a card I've had several requests for, so I guess it's
time to do it. Though it's green-bordered, it also has a tinge of blue,
and I seldom build a deck without it. That's right, none other
than...NO, not Stefan DeSeve! None other than our very own...


    @{b}MAJOR RAKAL@{ub}

    Rare Romulan/Federation (Dual-Affiliation) Personnel

    Integrity 4, Cunning 8, Strength 4, Command star, AU icon

    V.I.P.: Romulan: Tal Shiar, Empathy, Treachery
            Federation: Empathy, Diplomacy, INTEGRITY +4, CUNNING -1

@{i}"Physically altered, Deanna Troi was coerced to completely assume the
identity of a Tal Shiar major in the 2369 M'ret defection plot."@{ui} [The
name "Deanna Troi" is *not* in boldface, though errata will soon be
issued stating that it should be, indicating Rakal and Troi are the same
persona.]

This first dual-affiliation personnel was a great breakthrough for the
Romulans, providing by far the most valuable personnel available to the
Empire prior to the release of Taris and Sirol. Look at her advantages:

- Empathy. Rommies no longer had to rely on a single available Empath,
Devinoni Ral, unique and therefore unplayable in duplicate, to do the 40
point New Contact mission. The release of AU also made Empathy a
critical skill for countering Thought Fire (devastating to Romulans) and
Cardassian Trap. With Maques, she even provides hope of curing Frame of
Mind. And it's her *second* listed skill, untouchable by Rascals or
Tsiolkovsky Infection. Her Empathy alone makes her a virtual necessity
in any Romulan deck. But she has plenty more to recommend her.
- Treachery. Never can have enough of this for your basic Romulan
Treachery deck.
- Tal Shiar. A 40-point mission (Quash Conspiracy) she can complete on
her own. Just keep the Major on a handy Scout or Science Vessel
(preferably upline from the mission to avoid Borg Ship surprises) while
your basic crew takes out the dilemmas. Then when they are unable to
complete the mission, their attempt ends, move in the Major, and score
40. In addition, she can now serve as a battle leader if you have no
other, and allow you to attack a Romulan opponent.
- Female. With only 6 other Romulan females, two of which (Jera and
Selok) are virtually useless, she's real handy for those Matriarchal
Societies.
- AU Icon. Put her on a Cryosatellite, use her to staff the Decius,
complete Fissure Research.
- VIP Classification. A great backup VIP for Diplomatic Conference, as
you can use her for whichever affiliation you didn't already draw.
- Even CUNNING. Immune to Hunter Gangs.
- Dual Affiliation. She justifies seeding of an extra (Neutral) outpost
for her potential Federation affiliation, and allows you to "espionage"
Federation mission with the backup of non-aligned support personnel.

Her only Romulan disadvantage is her Integrity of 4, leaving her
vulnerable to Firestorms with no help available from D'Tan or Lower
Decks.

What about (heresy!) Federation decks? Well, in blue mode our Major is
just a clone of Deanna Troi, with two exceptions: her classification is
VIP instead of OFFICER (no big loss), and she has an AU icon. Which
makes her an nice replacement for her alter ego, as the advantages
listed above for these two features apply just as well to Federation
use, including staffing for the AU-hungry Future Enterprise. And her
dual affiliation again allows seeding of a Neutral Outpost, this time
for potential green-ness, not to mention the possibility of otherwise
impossible "espionage" of Romulan missions with non-aligned support
crew!

All in all, great for both affiliations, but with far more advantages
accruing to the Romulans. Don't leave the Outpost without her.

The Major's Combos:

- Major Rakal + any of my decks

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #15@{ub}

Aefvadh! I see I've been neglecting missions something awful. But instead
of doing one that you can actually complete and get points for, I'm going
to look at the peculiar little nothing mission...

    @{b}SPACE@{ub}

    @{i}"The final frontier...."@{ui}

    Common Space Mission

    No Affiliation Icon, Universal icon, no points, Span X
    Counts as 1/2 card. May insert into spaceline.

    X = 3 + number of adjacent (universal icon) locations.


Hmm. No affiliations, no requirements, no points. No wonder it only counts
as half a card! So what can you do with it?

First let's clarify its odd text a bit and talk about what you *can't* do
with it.

- "Counts as 1/2 card" means that you replace one normal mission from your
  deck with two of these. Those two count as one seed card out of the maximum
  of 30 you are allowed, and one card toward your 60-card deck.

- "May insert into spaceline" means you aren't restricted, as you are with
  all other missions, to placing it on either end of the spaceline as it is
  created card by card. You can insert it between two missions already
  placed.

- "Universal icon" means the same diamond-shaped array that appears on
  universal personnel and ships, and it has the same meaning here: you can
  have more than one of them in play at the same time, whereas normal
  missions must all be unique. There are two mission cards with the universal
  icon, Space and Nebula.

- The span is variable, depending on how many of them you have in a row. A
  single Space has a span of 3. If a Space has one universal on one side, its
  span is 3+1=4. If it has a universal on both sides, its span is 3+2=5. To
  illustrate, in the following spaceline diagram, M is any normal mission, S
  is the universal space mission, and N is the Nebula mission (which has a
  fixed span of 4). The span of the Space and Nebula missions is indicated
  below each mission.
     M   S   M   S   S   M   S   S   S   M   S   S   S   N   S   M   M
         3       4   4       4   5   4       4   5   5   4   4

- You can't place an affiliated outpost here (either seeded or built
  later), because they can only be placed at a location with a matching
  affiliation bar. You *can* place a Neutral Outpost here, because the
  Neutral Outpost has no affiliation and thus is exempt from needing a
  matching affiliation bar, and because you can seed it at any space
  location.

- You can't "attempt" or "complete" this mission, because there are
  norequirements. There's nothing to complete. And while you *could* seed
  dilemmas or artifacts here, there is no way for anyone to encounter the
  dilemmas, and artifacts can only be retrieved by completing the mission,
  which can't be done.

So, again, what *can* you do with it?

First and most obvious use: as a space-filler (pun unavoidable) and stall
tactic. Stick even two of these side by side between two of your opponent's
missions, and you make it more difficult to get around by introducing an
extra 8 span to pass. That's an extra turn for most ships. Put three in a
row and you introduce 4+5+4=13 extra span. That will take a ship with Range
9 one extra turn; with Range 8 or less, at least two extra turns (possibly
three, depending on the next span).

This works best against the Federation, whose only ships with range greater
than 8 are the USS Enterprise (9) and Future Enterprise (13). Klingons will
not be hampered too much if they're playing Vor'chas, as the universal and
most uniques have Range 9, but it can help keep those pesky K'vort armadas
(mostly Range 8) at arm's length. On the other hand, Romulans don't have it
so good with universal D'deridexes (8), but most of the uniques, and the
universal Scout Vessels, have Range 9, which can give them an edge.

The second use is not so obvious: the ultimate mission-stealing deck. Use
10 or 12 Space missions plus 1 or 0 real missions. Just keep inserting
Space missions between your opponent's missions in rows of 4 or 5,
isolating his missions into 3 pairs. If you use one real mission, try to
put it off on one end of the spaceline, separated from your opponent's
nearest pair by two Space missions. Chances are he will opt for one of the
center pair for his outpost, as giving him the best shot at reaching either
of the other pairs. But it's still going to be tough, as four Space in a
row have spans 4+5+5+4=18, and will take three turns to get past even with
a Range of 9. Keep a Disruptor Overload and a Baryon Buildup or two ready
to get rid of Plasmadyne Relays and slow his ships even more.

Now that you have your opponent effectively restricted to only two easily
reached missions, you need to solve some yourself. Not that single one
(available only to your affiliation) you placed at the end--it's going to
be so loaded with dilemmas that you won't want to touch it with a 10-foot
pole. No, that one's a backup position for you to build an affiliated
outpost, in case the Neutral you seed at a Space adjacent to your
opponent's mission is destroyed, and he has none with your affiliation's
icon. You will need an all-purpose generic mission-solving crew that can
tackle a wide variety of missions (I'll go into the makeup of such a crew
either in a later review or in a theme deck), with a lot of non-aligneds
and dual-affiliates, and some espionage cards (with Palor Toffs) in case
your opponent favors one-color missions. Also include some point dilemmas
like Barclay's in your seed deck to beef up the point values of the
missions you intend to solve.

So how does this strategy stack up for the different affiliations? If
you've read the article "Q-Factoids" recently posted on Decipher's siteby
game designer Tom Braunlich, you may have noticed a cryptic reference to
the Space mission having a subtle advantage for Romulans. That *might* be
the stall tactic noted above, but it's hard to say they really have any
advantage over the Klingons there. No, the real advantage comes with the
mission-stealing.

- Romulans can espionage both Federation and Klingon missions.
- Feds can only espionage Klingons. They may be able to do Romulan missions
  with Major Rakal and non-aligneds, but that particular form of
  mission-stealing is still easier for Romulans, because it's tougher for
  Feds to come up with all the Treachery that so many Rommie missions need,
  while Romulans have plenty of the Diplomacy and Leadership required by so
  many Fed missions.
- Klingons really have the worst of this; they can only espionage against
  Fed missions, and have no dual-affiliates (yet). Their one advantage is the
  skill-shifting K'chiQ, but they can still have only one at a mission site.

Advantage: Romulan.

The Major's Combos:

- 10 Space + Rakal + NAs + Espionage

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #16@{ub}


Aefvadh! You may have noticed a little gap in my reviews (like about 3
weeks). But I hope you'll feel that what I have coming up was worth the
wait. For the next couple of reviews, rather than review single cards,
I'm going to tackle a topic that seems to generate at least half of the
rules questions on the mailing list and BBS, namely, how dilemmas work.
So without further ado, I present to you...


    @{b}EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT DILEMMAS*@{ub}
    *but were afraid to ask

Does this dilemma stop the Away Team? Do I discard this dilemma or does
it return under the mission? What happens if there's no ship present?
And more. Dilemmas are one of the most important factors in the game,
and one of the most confusing. The latest FAQ covers the "components" of
dilemmas very concisely, but you may not have the FAQ handy, or may
wonder how to translate this information into practical terms to explain
how a particular dilemma works. In this review I will expand on the FAQ
explanation and give more examples.

Note: All of the following applies only to normal dilemmas, not to Q-
icon dilemmas.

However a dilemma is phrased, it all boils down to a few components:
        TRIGGERS
        CONDITIONS
        TARGETS
        EFFECTS
        CURES
        POINT VALUES
which collectively determine how it works (what it does to you, whether
it stops you, and how you dispose of it).

A TRIGGER is something that must be present or in effect if the dilemma
is going to do anything at all. In other words, something that
"triggers" the dilemma. If it is explicitly stated, it will be at the
beginning of the dilemma and usually starts with "If..."
        "If android present..."
        "If a Romulan ship present..."
        "If The Traveler: Transcendence is affecting you..."
One exception to this "If" rule is Bendii Syndrome, which reads, "One
Vulcan without Youth present..." Although this may appear to be a TARGET
(the Vulcan is targeted to die), it is considered a TRIGGER because an
affected Vulcan is necessary for the dilemma to have its effect on other
personnel.

The most common trigger that is not explicitly stated is a ship. If a
dilemma's effects target the ship itself (and not the crew), then the
ship is a trigger. If it explicitly says "Play (or place) on ship", then
the ship is also a trigger, even if it actually affects the personnel.

CONDITIONS are the most common dilemma component. They are the
requirements that you must meet in order to avoid the dilemma's bad
efefcts. They may include skills, attributes, specific personnel,
equipment, or other elements that must be present at the dilemma site,
or occasionally, an action you must take such as discarding something.
They usually (but not always) include the word "unless," as in "Unless
XXX is present, something bad happens." They include the requirements of
so-called "wall dilemmas", where you must have certain skills, etc., to
get past the dilemma and continue.
        "Unless INTEGRITY > 32..."
        "...unless SECURITY and MEDICAL present."
        "...Away Team must have Computer Skill present."
        "...unless...you bribe rebels...by discarding an Equipment card."
When a dilemma has conditions, they must be overcome *when the dilemma
is encountered* in order to avoid its effects. Bringing the necessary
skills in later cannot undo a dilemma's effects, i.e., CONDITIONS may
not be used as a CURE.

TARGETS are personnel with specific characteristics that the dilemma can
affect. If no personnel with that characteristic are present, no one
will be affected, but the dilemma may have other consequences.
        "...two Away Team members with Diplomacy..."
        "All Away Team members with INTEGRITY < 5..."
        "...one unique, non-Cardassian personnel..."
The presence or absence of specified TARGETS in the Away Team has no
effect on discarding a dilemma or stopping the Away Team. They simply
limit who may be affected.

EFFECTS are, well, effects! They may only happen if you don't overcome
the conditions of the dilemma, or they may be something that you cannot
prevent. Effects may include killing or otherwise discarding one or more
personnel (Yuta, Anaphasic Organism), diseases and other long-lasting
effects that may or may not expire naturally or be curable later
(Rascals, Birth of Junior, Parallel Romance), damage and destruction of
ships (Null Space, Nitrium Metal Parasites), stalling of ships
(Conundrum) or Away Teams (Alien Labyrinth), loss of points (The
Higher...The Fewer), and other nasty consequences (Sheliak).

CURES appear similar to CONDITIONS, but instead of preventing an
immediate effect from taking place, a cure either puts an end to an
ongoing effect, or prevents a "delayed effect" from taking place. A cure
usually requires skills, attributes, or equipment that must be brought
to the dilemma site or to the affected ship or personnel, or may be an
action that you must take. The dilemma may say "cured by (or with)...",
or "...until XXX present."
        "...until mission completed OR 3 Leadership present."
        "Cure with 3 Empathy present."
        "...unless 3 MEDICAL present OR ship returns to outpost first."
The last example is from REM Fatigue Hallucinations and at first glance
appears to be conditions rather than a cure. It would be more clear if
it it read "...unless 3 MEDICAL present by then" [i.e., before the end
of your third full turn].

POINT VALUES are indicated in a point box on the card. You may gain or
lose points from a dilemma. If the dilemma doesn't state explicitly how
you score the points (e.g., Sarjenka, The Higher...The Fewer), then you
score them:
        -when you overcome a dilemma's conditions (e.g., Nagilum)
        -when you cure a dilemma (e.g., Hyper-Aging)
If you don't overcome a dilemma's conditions or cure it as specified,
you don't score the points.

NULLIFIERS are one more thing that can affect what a dilemma does, but
are almost never mentioned on the dilemma card itself. Many dilemmas may
be nullified by the presence in the Away Team of a specific personnel,
equipment, or artifact card; by the existence of an Event in play; or by
playing an Interrupt card.
        Firestorm (nullified by Thermal Deflectors)
        Armus (nullified by Interphase Generator)
        Empathic Echo (nullified by Plexing, Mr. Homn, Madame Guinan)


Whew! So, you may ask, how does all this let you figure how what to do
with the danged dilemma once you turn it up? There are a few simple
rules to follow.

1. If a required TRIGGER is not present, the dilemma is nullified and
discarded immediately. It has no further effect.

2. If you nullify the dilemma with a NULLIFIER personnel, equipment,
event, or interrupt, discard the dilemma immediately. It has no further
effect.

3. The Away Team or crew is stopped only if a dilemma has CONDITIONS and
you did not overcome them.

4. Discard the dilemma after following its instructions:
        - if it had no conditions and doesn't enter play
        - if it had conditions and you overcame them
        - if it says "discard dilemma"
        - when you cure a dilemma that enters play
        - when a dilemma that enters play expires or is destroyed
If the dilemma carries bonus points, place it in the bonus point area
when applicable rather than discarding it.

5. If it doesn't meet one of the criteria for discarding and doesn't
enter play, it remains under the mission to be encountered again.

In Review #17, I will present Major Rakal's 5-Step Guide to Dilemma
Resolution, including a couple of detailed examples of how to "parse" a
dilemma, and  (drum roll!> provide a link to a table of "Dilemma Facts"
on my website which lists in gory detail exactly how each dilemma is
handled.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #17@{ub}


Aefvadh! In my last review I described the components of dilemmas and
gave a few simple rules for determining how each dilemma works. For
those who are more comfortable with following a flow chart, here is...


    @{b}MAJOR RAKAL'S 5-STEP GUIDE TO DILEMMA RESOLUTION.@{ub}


1. Does the dilemma require a TRIGGER?
     NO:  Go on to step 2.
     YES: Is the trigger present?
          YES: Go on to step 2.
          NO:  Discard the dilemma. It has no effect. You must
               continue to the next dilemma.

2. Can you NULLIFY the dilemma with a personnel or equipment in your
Away Team, with an Event that is in play, or by playing an Interrupt?
     NO:  Go on to step 3.
     YES: Discard the dilemma. It has no effect. You must continue
          to the next dilemma.

3. Does the dilemma have CONDITIONS?
     NO:  Carry out the instructions on the dilemma for its effects.
          Your Away Team is NOT stopped and must continue to the next
          dilemma (unless this dilemma prevents them from doing so). Go on
          to step 4.
     YES: Can you overcome the conditions?
          YES: Discard the dilemma (or place it in your bonus point
               area if it carries a point value). You must continue to the
               next dilemma.
          NO:  Carry out the instructions on the dilemma for its
               effects. Your Away Team is stopped. Go on to step 4.

4. Did the dilemma "enter play" by playing on personnel, a ship, the
   table, or the spaceline; or does it have a lasting effect on personnel
   (usually equivalent to "playing on" the personnel)?
     NO:  Go on to step 5.
     YES: Leave it in play until you cure it, it expires naturally, or
          it is destroyed. At that time, discard the dilemma (or place it
          in your bonus point area if it carries a point value).

5. Does it say "Discard dilemma"?
     YES: Discard the dilemma (or place it in your bonus point area if
          it carries a point value).
     NO:  If the dilemma had conditions, replace it under the mission
          to be encountered again on the next mission attempt. Discard it
          when finally overcome. If it had no conditions, discard it.

That's it. Well, almost. Keep in mind that...

* The text of the dilemma may override some of these rules. For example,
  Chinese Finger Puzzle has no conditions, but states that it stops the
  Away Team.

* A dilemma may have two possible sets of effects. You may make a choice
  (Edo Probe), or circumstances may dictate which set to follow (Outpost
  Raid). Once the set is chosen, ignore the other set of instructions.

* Some dilemmas just don't fit this pattern. Simply do exactly what the
  card says. It's usually clear.

Let's look at a few examples.

NAUSICAANS
"Three Nausicaans pick a fight. One Away Team member is killed (random
selection) unless STRENGTH >44. Discard dilemma."

1. There is no trigger required to be present.

2. Nausicaans can be nullified by an Interphase Generator, or by Zon. If
you have one of these cards in your Away Team, discard the dilemma and
go on to the next one. If not, go on to step 3.

3. The dilemma has conditions: it takes effect "unless STRENGTH >44".
Add the STRENGTHs in your Away Team, including modifiers such as
Phasers. If the total is 45 or more, you overcame the dilemma; discard
it, and go on to the next one. Your Away Team is not stopped. If you
don't meet the conditions, select one personnel to be killed and discard
him. The rest of the Away Team is stopped.

4. If you didn't overcome the dilemma, you must decide what to do with
it. This dilemma does not enter play or have a long-term effect (well, I
suppose death is a long-term effect, but we're talking about diseases
and such here), so go to step 5.

5. It says "discard dilemma." Do it. You won't encounter this dilemma
again.


CHALNOTH (5 Bonus Points)
"Kills one Away Team member (opponent's choice) unless 3 SECURITY OR
STRENGTH>40 present. Discard dilemma."

This works virtually the same as Nausicaans, except for the bonus
points, so I will only discuss the differences.

2. Nullifiable by Interphase Generator. If nullified, you don't get the
bonus points.

3. If you overcome the dilemma, place it in your bonus point area
instead of discarding it.


EMPATHIC ECHO (AU icon)
"One personnel present with Empathy (random selection) is killed unless
SECURITY and MEDICAL present."

1. No trigger is required. "One personnel present with Empathy" is a
target; the dilemma kills one randomly-selected personnel, just like
Nausicaans, but the personnel selection is limited to those with
Empathy.

2. Could be nullified by Mr. Homn or Madame Guinan in the Away Team (if
Madame G. hasn't already nullified an AU-icon card this turn), or by
playing the Plexing interrupt. If so, discard the dilemma now.

3. The conditions are SECURITY and MEDICAL. If they are present, discard
the dilemma and go on. What's that? It doesn't *say* "discard dilemma"?
True, but you overcame the conditions, which always means you discard
it. This bears repeating: IF YOU OVERCOME A DILEMMA WITH CONDITIONS, IT
*ALWAYS* GOES AWAY. YOU NEVER ENCOUNTER IT AGAIN.
   Now, suppose you didn't overcome it. Separate your personnel with
Empathy and randomly select one to die. If you have no personnel with
Empathy present, no one dies. But what happens to the dilemma? Go on to
steps 4 and 5 to see.

4. The dilemma does not enter play. Go on to step 5.

5. Aha! The dilemma does not say "discard dilemma," AND it had
conditions. Put it back under the mission, where it will be encountered
again by the next player to attempt the mission. In effect, this is not
only a killer dilemma, but also a "wall" dilemma. Because it doesn't say
you can discard it, you must have SECURITY + MEDICAL to get by it,
whether it actually kills anyone or not.


MAMAN PICARD (AU icon)
"If this is a Federation ship, immediately transport it to any end of
the spaceline (opponent's choice)."

1. The dilemma must be encountered by a Federation ship to trigger it.
If you attempted from your outpost, or if the ship is non-Fed, discard
the dilemma.

2. Madame Guinan could nullify this if she is aboard. If not...

3. It has no conditions. The ship is instantly transported to the end of
the spaceline. The crew is not stopped, so the ship can move if it has
RANGE remaining.

4. The dilemma did not enter play. It simply has its effect and is done.

5. It does not say "discard dilemma." BUT, it had no conditions, so you
discard it anyway.


CYTHERIANS (15 Bonus Points)
"Place on ship. Ship must do nothing but travel to far end of spaceline
at normal speed. When reached, discard dilemma. Score points."

1. It says "Place on ship," so a ship is required to trigger this
dilemma. If you attempted the mission from your outpost, the trigger is
not "present" (even if there is a ship there, the crew wasn't on it when
it encountered the dilemma), so discard the dilemma and go on to the
next. If you were aboard a ship, go on to step 2.

2. Nothing else can nullify Cytherians.

3. This dilemma has no conditions. It "just happens," and there is no
combination of skills, etc., that you could have had there to prevent
it. So your crew is not stopped and must begin their journey to the far
end of the spaceline immediately, assuming the ship has any RANGE left.
(They cannot go on to the next dilemma because the card overrides this.)

4. The dilemma enters play, on the ship. Reaching the end of the
spaceline may be considered a "cure", so at that time you will place the
dilemma in your bonus point area. The ship may then go about its
business.


If you'd rather not have to figure this out for every dilemma, just go
to my webpage at the URL listed below for a concise table listing all
current dilemmas and how they work. Because some of my readers on the
mailing list may not have Internet access, I am also sending out the
same information in two email text files which should be printable as
tabular files if you display them in a monospaced font (like Courier).

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #18@{ub}


Aefvadh! Now that we've all recovered from my back-to-back dilemma
reviews, I'd like to do a slightly different personnel review. It's not
exclusively Romulan, but the cards are similar and easy to review
together. Besides, this review is for a friend of mine, who hangs out on
various BBSs, newsgroups, and chat rooms as either of the EEHPs
(Emergency Engineering Holographic Programs), and actually plays with
them, too (and beat me with them more than once, I fear). Hi, K'Tomek,
here are *both* your alter egos...


    @{b}TOMEK@{ub}

    Common Romulan Personnel, universal

    Integrity 4, Cunning 7, Strength 6, Hologram icon

    ENGINEER: Astrophysics

@{i}"Re-creation of a male Romulan. Alien entity assumed this body in 2369."@{ui}


    @{b}K'TESH@{ub}

    Common Klingon Personnel, universal

    Integrity 5, Cunning 5, Strength 6, Hologram icon

    ENGINEER: Stellar Cartography

@{i}"Re-creation who assisted in the Age of Ascension ritual. Perfected
current pain-stick design for ritual use."@{ui}


These guys were somewhat frustrating in the premiere set. Both Romulans
and Klingons were mighty short on ENGINEERS compared to the Feds, and
one of each was a hologram, for crying out loud. And not a red or green
holodeck in sight. Short of a Husnock Ship or a Treaty with Starfleet,
the only way to play them was Holo-Projectors. And nothing so far makes
them work on an outpost. With the advent of AU, things got a *little*
better: each affiliation got an AU ship with a holodeck--and a hefty
staffing requirement. Question is, are they worth it? One red dot in
each skills box doesn't go very far. Can you get along without them?

First, the Romulans: five green missions (including a 40- and a 45-
pointer) require Astrophysics. Investigate "Shattered Space" even needs
Astro x2. The only other Romulan Astrophysicist is the unique Mirok,
with mediocre stats (lousy Integrity) but both SCIENCE and ENGINEER to
recommend him. He needs a backup (especially if you're going to try
Shattered Space), but from the start Dr. Reyga has been a lot easier to
use than a holo (and better than Mirok to boot), or Jo'Bril; with QC you
can also choose from Timicin (if you can time it right before he dies),
Data's Body (if you can get the head), or Paul Manheim. If you want a
universal ENGINEER, Palteth's Computer Skill is more generally useful.
So not much real need for poor Tomek.

Now, the Klingons: four red missions require Stellar Cartography, all 35
points or less. Two can be done alternatively with CUNNING alone--but
CUNNING > 50 is tough for the Klingons, with their average CUNNING of
only 5.5. What are your other choices for Stellar Cartography?  Dr.
Reyga. That's it. Except for a little addition in QC called K'chiQ. You
can only have one K'chiQ aboard your ship, and you have to make sure she
doesn't get caught without her warrior, and she needs an AU door (which
means she can be stowed on a Cryosatellite)...but she can deliver the
Stellar Cartography. You'll have to decide which is more trouble, the
care and feeding of K'chiQ, or keeping the Holo-Projectors operational.

So why might you want to use the EEHPs anyway? As redshirts, of course.
Sure, holograms can get "killed" by dilemmas. But instead of going to
your discard pile like normal personnel, they just deactivate back to
the controlling ship, and pop up again, good as new, on your next turn.
What's that, you say, Love Interests don't kill? Right, but try to send
a holo to the far end of the spaceline and he "leaves the holodeck" so
to speak...deactivated again. You don't have to go off and pick him up.
And a few dilemmas they're outright immune to; if it affects DNA, holos
(who don't have any) can just laugh at it. There are some wall dilemmas
they can't get by, of course, notably Shaka. And you do have to watch
out for ship-destroyers (about the only way to discard a holo). But you
*can* send off one holo after another to encounter killers, and have
them all come back to life next turn.

If you're going to try to use holos, the Romulans have an edge. First,
the other green holo is the surprisingly useful Jera (MEDICAL: Biology,
Youth); using her too makes generating holos more worthwhile. The
Klingons only have Fek'lhr (VIP: Honor, Treachery, 6-1-15), dim-witted
and of much more limited use (maybe handy for Brute Force). Second, the
Romulan holodeck-equipped ship, the Decius, with staffing requirements
of CSA (and you probably are using the good Major so there's your AU
icon), is a lot easier to use than the I.K.C. Fek'lhr which requires one
more AU icon.

The Major's Combos:

- K'Tesh or Tomek and the 2-Player Game Introductory Rules.

Oh, you wanted a *card* combo...

- Tomeks + Jeras + Decius + Study Lonka Pulsar

- lots of K'Teshes + Holo-Projectors + planet missions

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #19@{ub}


Aefvadh! Today I'd like to *hic* review a card that has generated a lot of
*hic* confusion and *hic* quite a few review requests. Thinking about how
this *hic* card works always *hic* gives me a *hic* headache, or at the
very least, a case of the hiccups...


    @{b}MANHEIM'S DIMENSIONAL DOOR: HOW IT WORKS@{ub}

    Rare Doorway
    AU Icon

    Plays on any planet. Affects all players. While in play, whenever any
    player has a card in hand matching one just played by his opponent, the
    Manheim Effect (a temporal "hiccup") may occur. Opponent's card is
    suspended while player shows matching card, returns it to hand and plays
    any card from hand as if played normally. (Not duplicatable.) Nullify
    with Anti-Matter Pod.


First, a definition: when you "suspend" a card play, the card does not
resolve until whatever suspended it is resolved. The suspended card is not
in your hand--you are in the act of playing it, but it is not yet in play.

Manheim's magic door has two basic uses. First, and simplest, you can use
it to gain a "free" card play, often during your opponent's turn. You play
Kivas Fajo, I show a Kivas Fajo from my hand and suspend yours, and then I
play a personnel card to my outpost. You then proceed with your Kivas draw,
while I now have an extra personnel in play, a nice bonus if I don't have a
Red Alert out. Better yet, I could use my "free" card play to get out my
Red Alert, which will then be ready to use on my turn. Or if what I really
need is more cards in my hand, I can play the Kivas Fajo that I just
showed, and have a better selection of cards to play when my turn comes.

The second use is the one that can give you headaches. Instead of just
getting in a free card play for yourself, you can play something that will
actively interfere with the card that your opponent is attempting to play,
by making that card play either illegal or useless. Card plays normally
resolve "first in, first out", unless a card specifically modifies or
nullifies the first card's effect. So when your opponent initiates an Away
Team battle against you and plays Phaser Burns, it's normally too late for
you to destroy the enabling disruptor with a Disruptor Overload. The Phaser
Burns will resolve first, killing two of your personnel. Then the battle
itself must resolve (you can't interrupt a battle action with a Disruptor
Overload). After the battle is over, your Disruptor Overload will resolve.
A bit too late.

But if Manheim's Dimension Door is in play, you have a certain amount of
"last in, first out" capability. Opponent initiates battle and plays Phaser
Burns. If you can show Phaser Burns from your hand, then you can play your
Disruptor Overload and take out his disruptor. Now his Phaser Burns play
resumes and...oops! Without a disruptor present, Phaser Burnsis illegal,
and he must return the card to his hand. The battle continues, but you
still have your full complement to fight him.

Other possible "hiccups" don't make the card play illegal, just useless.
Opponent plays a single Rogue Borg on your ship in an attempt to stop you.
Drat! You had Intruder Force Field in your hand but hadn't gotten to play
it yet! No problem if you too have a Rogue Borg to show; now you play that
Intruder Force Field, and his single Rogue Borg has no effect (unless he
has two more to add to it). But it doesn't go back to his hand, because IFF
doesn't make it illegal to play a single Rogue Borg, just ineffective. So
the ineffective Borg goes to the discard pile.

A "chain" of temporal hiccups may also occur.
- You play Red Alert.
-- I show Red Alert and play Major Rakal.
--- You show Major Rakal and play Kivas Fajo.
---- I show Kivas Fajo and play Yellow Alert.
---- You don't have a Yellow Alert to show, so mine resolves.
--- Your Kivas Fajo resolves and you draw three cards.
-- My Major Rakal resolves and reports for duty.
- Your Red Alert can no longer resolve because of my Yellow Alert. It
returns to your hand and you can play another card instead (perhaps one of
the three you drew with Kivas).

You can maximize your opportunities to use the Manheim Effect by including
cards in your deck that you're pretty sure your opponent will also use.
Most players are likely to use some combination of Amanda Rogers, Kevin
Uxbridge, Kivas Fajo, Red Alert, Traveler, and, since QC, Q's Tent. At the
very least, these will almost certainly net you some free card plays. If
you know your opponent and have an idea of his typical deck, you may be
able to include some personnel cards that he's likely to use. For example,
most Romulan and Klingon players tend to supplement their affiliated
personnel with non-aligneds. Maques, Devinoni Ral, Roga Danar, Dr. Reyga,
and Vekor turn up a lot. Romulan decks tend to have a certain Major for
their prime Empath. Federation players will probably have all or most of
the bridge crew. If you anticipate battle, be prepared with Phaser Burns
and Anti-Matter Spread.

There are a couple of ways to nullify MDD, one to close it, and one to
enhance it.

- To nullify it with an Anti-Matter Pod, you simply have an Away Team take
the Pod (an Equipment card) to the planet where the Door is located. The
Door is discarded, the Pod is not. If you're playing Federation, you can
help protect your MDD by leaving Sonya Gomez on the planet; she has the
skill of suspending Anti-Matter Pod effects.
- Paul Manheim has a two-way skill; he can nullify an MDD where present, or
he can double its effect (i.e., you get to play two cards during the
hiccup). Either player's Paul Manheim can affect either player's Door.
- You can close an MDD with a Revolving Door. No more temporal hiccups may
occur until the MDD is reopened, with either Kevin Uxbridge or an Alternate
Universe Door.

One final note: since MDD is a Doorway card, it does not count as your card
play when you play it on the planet, but you can only play it during your
own turn.


The Major's Combos:

Too many interesting possibilities to list here! Instead, my next review
will consist of nothing but Manheim's Dimensional Door uses.

Aefvadh! Now that I've gotten rid of those dratted hiccups, here's the
combos I promised you...


    @{b}THE MANY USES OF MANHEIM'S DIMENSIONAL DOOR@{ub}

Last time I discussed how the card works. I'm not going to repeat the card
text here (check @{"Review #19" link MRRR19} if you missed it), but I will repeat the
important definition of "suspend": when you "suspend" a card play, the card
does not resolve until whatever suspended it is resolved. The suspended
card is not in your hand--you are in the act of playing it, but it is not
yet in play.

Also, there are three possible resolutions for a suspended card:
- If you make it illegal to play the suspended card, it goes back to the
  player's hand (because it hasn't actually made it into play yet).
- If you just make the suspended card irrelevant to play, it's "wasted" and
  discarded.
- The hiccup card may have no direct effect on the suspended card.

And now, without further ado, the examples, ably demonstrated by players
K'lutz and N'Trepid. (I leave it to you to figure out what affiliations
they are playing.) Note that there are many intervening turns in this game,
not shown here. I also take no responsibility for figuring out where
N'Trepid got all those cards from (Traveler and lots of Kivas's, maybe?).

*****

K'lutz plays a Q's Tent to access his Tent. N'Trepid counters by showing a
Q's Tent...and slaps a Revolving Door on K'lutz's Tent. K'lutz can no
longer access the Tent, and the Doorway card returns to his hand. Annoyed,
K'lutz plays Red Alert. N'Trepid shows Red Alert and plays Yellow Alert.
Red Alert is now illegal and returns to K'lutz's hand. He plays a Traveler
instead.

Over the next few turns, K'lutz collects cards in his hand with increasing
frustration over his lack of a Red Alert, as he can only play them one at a
time. Finally, however, he smiles and plays Kitrik (who has Cybernetics
skill), then lays down one Soong-type Android, starts to pull another card
from his hand... N'Trepid shows an STA, then hiccups with a Brain Drain on
Kitrik, who loses all his skills for the rest of this turn. Without
Cybernetics present, the STA is an illegal play; Kitrik used up his card
play for the turn. Back to the hand!

Next turn, however, Kitrik has his Cybernetics back, and K'lutz, after
playing another unique personnel, once again plays an STA, confident that
N'Trepid won't have another Brain Drain. N'Trepid shows the same STA and
and this time plays Masaka Transformations, forcing K'lutz to place his
handful of STAs on the bottom of his draw deck and replace with the random
cards from the top of the deck.

K'lutz finally attempts a mission (not at his outpost) and hits Firestorm.
Because his team relies heavily on Lursa, B'Etor, and a Targ, he decides
that a hasty retreat would be prudent, and plays Emergency Transporter
Armbands to beam out. N'Trepid shows ETA and plays a Temporal Rift on
K'lutz's ship. With no ship to beam to, ETA is illegal and returns to
K'lutz's hand. The Duras sisters and the Targ get toasted, and the rest of
the decimated Away Team goes on and gets stopped by a Holographic Ruse.

N'Trepid now beams down with some Jarons, STAs, and a Galathon, and attacks
K'lutz's stopped Away Team. With his ship still lost in that Rift and
inaccessible with ETA, the now-panicking K'lutz (who does *not* think it is
a good day to die, and with only Kitrik, a few non-aligneds and a
Disruptor left in his Away Team) plays Phaser Burns instead. N'Trepid, not
expecting such a display of resistance, unfortunately has no Disruptor
Overload handy (see @{"Review #19" link MRRR19}). Thinking quickly, he shows a Phaser Burns
anyway, and then plays Humuhumunukunukuapua'a. Suddenly K'lutz's
non-aligneds are all STRENGTH -4, and N'Trepid's are mostly STRENGTH +4.
The Phaser Burns still take effect and N'Trepid loses a Jaron and an STA,
but the respective STRENGTH drain and enhancement ultimately loses the
battle for K'lutz, and his Amarie gets killed.

In retribution for Amarie (he has a Ressikan Flute under that mission),
once his ship returns from the Temporal Rift, K'lutz beams up the remnants
of his Away Team, initiates a ship battle against the Haakona, and plays
Anti-Matter Spread. N'Trepid shows Anti-Matter Spread, and plays another
Temporal Rift, this time on his own ship. Now K'lutz has nothing to attack.
Anti-Matter Spread returns to his hand.

Having no luck in battle, K'lutz retreats to his outpost and attempts to
report Zon for duty. N'Trepid shows Zon and hiccups with a Wrong Door,
moving the Revolving Door to K'lutz's Alternate Universe Door. With that
Doorway closed, it is illegal to play an AU-icon personnel, so Zon returns
to K'lutz's hand.

K'lutz is now really steamed. Determined to play his Zon, he tries to Kevin
Uxbridge that blasted Revolving Door. N'Trepid shows Kevin and plays Rishon
Uxbridge on the Revolving Door, protecting it by making it illegal to play
Kevin on it, and Kevin returns to the hand. (Before everyone rushes to tell
me that the QC Rules Supplement says the Kevin targets Rishon instead, I'll
just tell you that Q gave me this ruling. Kevin Uxbridge targets an Event
card, not a location. K'lutz *could* redirect Kevin to Rishon, but he
doesn't have to.)

K'lutz urgently needs some personnel and plays Res-Q to get back Lursa.
N'Trepid shows Res-Q, hiccups with Devidian Foragers, and puts Lursa and
B'Etor out of play, leaving K'lutz with a lowly Targ and Amarie as his only
choices. He chooses the Targ and ends his turn.

N'Trepid now has a bit of bad luck. He audaciously attempts the space
mission at K'lutz's outpost location from the Haakona and hits a Quantum
Singularity Lifeforms, putting the ship and all his crew (not to mention
K'lutz's) into stasis. As N'Trepid ponders his next move, a gloating K'lutz
pulls out a Dead in Bed and prepares to choose one of N'Trepid's crew to
die. N'Trepid smiles, shows a Dead in Bed, and hiccups with Emergency
Transporter Armbands, removing the ship and crew from stasis and rendering
Dead in Bed illegal.

Now K'lutz is getting desperate. He plays Subspace Schism when N'Trepid
draws his end-of-turn card. N'Trepid shows Subspace Schism and plays the
card he just drew, reporting a personnel to his outpost. K'lutz's Subspace
Schism now has no legal target, and returns to his hand.

N'Trepid plays Palor Toff. Fearing that he's going to retrieve one of the
hated Temporal Rifts, K'lutz plays Countermanda. But N'Trepid shows
Countermanda, hiccups with a Res-Q, and grabs the Temporal Rift out of the
discard pile. When K'lutz's Countermanda resolves, there's nothing left in
the discard pile for him to put out of play except the Res-Q, the personnel
he killed earlier with Phaser Burns, and a couple of dilemmas. Only a
partial recovery for N'Trepid, but at least he got his Rift back.

The hapless K'lutz now plays Plasma Fire on N'Trepid's ship. N'Trepid shows
a Plasma Fire and then plays Thermal Deflectors. The Plasma Fire is not
illegal, but it is immediately nullified when it resolves.

On his next turn, N'Trepid plays a Tox Uthat (retrieved earlier from a
mission) on the table, making K'lutz a bit nervous. He still has a Kevin
Uxbridge in hand, but he can't decide whether to use it on the Tox (maybe
N'Trepid doesn't have the Supernova yet), or to get rid of that miserable
Revolving Door. When N'Trepid moves his ship away from K'lutz's outpost,
K'lutz's anxiety level increases and he decides to go for the Tox.
N'Trepid, of course, shows a Kevin, and hiccups with a Supernova that takes
out K'lutz's outpost and sole ship and crew.

*****

There are plenty of variations on the above examples.
- Playing Thermal Deflectors as a hiccup card after Fire Sculptor, Phaser
  Burns, or Destroy Radioactive Garbage Scow will nullify the first two and
  protect your personnel from the effects of the third.
- The Temporal Rift in response to Anti-Matter Spread could actually be
  played on either ship. The attacker can't continue the battle once his ship
  is Rifted. The Rift could also be played as a hiccup after almost any card
  played on a ship (Ship Seizure, Transwarp Conduit, Distortion of Space/Time
  Continuum), leaving no target.
- Instead of Brain-Draining Cybernetics away, if your opponent is relying
  on Juliana Tainer, turn her off with an Off Switch instead to prevent free
  deployment of STAs. Or Brain Drain Mr. Homn to keep him from reporting an
  Empath to his location.
- Use Fire Sculptor as a hiccup card after a Res-Q or Palor Toff, instead
  of Devidian Foragers. It only puts one card out of play instead of two, but
  if you get the one he needed most, it will do its trick.
- And an all-purpose Interrupt-stopper: Goddess of Empathy. Show a
  duplicate of your opponent's interrupt (except Kevin or Q2) and hiccup with
  the Goddess. His interrupt is now illegal, as are all others until the end
  of your next turn (double-edged, because you can't play them either).

The Major's Combos:

- What, that wasn't enough???  ;-)  Have fun figuring out your own devious
  uses for the magic door.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #21@{ub}


Aefvadh! While we're waiting for the final details of the Anthology preview
cards to be officially released, let's take a look at the one card we've
already seen. He has a completely new affiliation and a lovely
bluish-purple border, both of which promise to complement Romulan green
perfectly...


    @{b}GARAK@{ub}

    Rare Cardassian/Non-aligned (Dual Affiliation) Personnel, unique
    Integrity 7, Cunning 8, Strength 6, Staff Star, AU icon

    CIVILIAN: SECURITY, Computer Skill, Honor, May replace anyone randomly
    selected to die here.

@{i}"Cardassian male. Virtual player in the Vorta scenario testing the resolve
of Alpha Quadrant species. Risked his life in the defense of his comrades."@{ui}


Garak's first notable feature is his unusual dual "affiliation"--something
of a misnomer, as "non-aligned" is, by definition, not an affiliation. But
it has the advantage of allowing the early introduction of a lone character
from a new affiliation, who is also usable by any of the existing
afiliations, and can even be used to augment an all NA Away team for Qualor
II Rendezvous. And given Garak's exile from Cardassia, it's even a logical
choice for his card (he would repatriate to Cardassia if he could, but is
non-aligned by necessity), not just expedient for gameplay. When the DS9
expansions appear and the Cardassians arrive as a full-fledged affiliation,
he will be just as usable as any full Cardassian. His NA icon will also
allow his inclusion in other affiliation decks, switching him for
Cardassian "espionage", just as a Federation deck can now use Major Rakal
plus NAs to "espionage" against the Romulans.

Since at the moment he can really only be used as non-aligned, how do
Garak's skills shape up as advantages for the different affiliations?

He's another dual-classification personnel, both ones that are badly
under-represented among the Romulans and, to a lesser extent, the Klingons.
Garak is the first non-aligned SECURITY genuinely worth using since Roga
Danar. The Feds are already well-equipped with strongly-skilled SECURITY
personnel and so benefit little from Garak, but he's a real boon to both
Romulans (1 decent unique, 2 so-so universals) and Klingons (2 good
uniques, two universals with only Honor as a skill).

The Romulans have only two CIVILIANs (D'Tan and the fairly useless DeSeve),
so gaining one that can double in such a crucial area as SECURITY is very
important to tight deck-building. The Klingons already have 6 CIVILIANs, of
which Kahlest, with MEDICAL skill, and K'chiQ, who can be given SECURITY,
MEDICAL, or almost anything else, are probably more useful than Garak.
Though the Federation has relatively few CIVILIANs, Lal (with her ability
to double two other skills and her android capabilities) or Nikolai Rozhenko
or Vash (with the rather uncommon--for Feds--Anthropology and Treachery)
may be more useful.

Computer Skill is uncommon among Klingons and therefore quite useful;
Romulans usually have plenty, but can use him in a deck with a lot of
redundant mission requirements. On the other hand, the Klingons hardly need
his Honor, while that skill is solid gold to the Romulans. His built-in
"Security Sacrifice" should help either of these affiliations, who gain the
function of that card without taking up a card slot, always helpful for
affiliations who have trouble building a tight deck. He would also be a
good backup SECURITY for the Feds if you want to be able to sacrifice one
and still keep Worf's and Tasha's other skills.

How about stats? His INTEGRITY is as high as any Romulan's to date, and is
even pretty good for a Klingon. CUNNING is high, excellent for the dullard
Klingons and better than the average Romulan. STRENGTH is only moderate--it
would be considered "good" only for the Feds--but Romulan and Klingon
average STRENGTH is high enough that it won't hurt them, and the other
stats more than make up for a lack here.

His AU icon, as usual, benefits Klingons and Romulans the most (with only 3
native AUs each) and Feds little (they have 9). He'll be a welcome
crewmember aboard either the Decius or the Fek'lhr.

Garak finally gives the Klingons the ability to seed a Neutral Outpost (for
his Cardassian affiliation) without wasting a card slot for an unusable
personnel, as he will actually be used as non-aligned. Note that he gains
nothing for the Feds and Rommies, if they are already using Rakal for that
purpose; you are only allowed to substitute a Neutral Outpost for *one*
affiliated outpost in the seed phase.

On balance, I give the nod to the Romulans as having the most to gain from
Garak, with the Klingons close behind.

- Garak + Taris + Mirok + Major Rakal + Kurlan Naiskos

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #22@{ub}


Aefvadh! I've been waiting (im)patiently for the rest of the Anthology
preview cards to be revealed, because I was eagerly anticipating the only
*real* Romulan so far from Voyager (it's hard to count the ex-Borg Romulan;
I didn't even notice his pointed ears). Well, he's here at last, and I'm
not disappointed...


    @{b}DR. TELEK R'MOR@{ub}

    Rare Romulan Personnel, unique

    Integrity 7, Cunning 7, Strength 7, Command Star, AU icon

    SCIENCE: Astrophysics x2, Stellar Cartography, Honor, ENGINEER,
    May report directly to any ship.

@{i}"Romulan Astrophysical Academy member on deep space duty in 2351. Beamed to
the present via a micro-wormhole to the U.S.S. Voyager."@{ui}

Finally, we're getting a respectable number of dual-classification
Romulans, and the SCIENCE/ENGINEER combo is a very useful one. The Romulans
have been very weak in ENGINEERs; with only one generally useful universal
(I don't consider holos *generally* useful--sorry, Tomek), who has only one
skill, and the SCIENCE/ENGINEER Mirok, in the premiere set, it's been
necessary to supplement with non-aligneds (Roga Danar, Dr. Reyga) or else
use Engineering Kits. With the addition of Sirol, and now Telek R'Mor, it
is now possible to have adequate ENGINEER skill without kits, and two of
them double up with the also very necessary SCIENCE. He can contribute to
either or both shield enhancer cards.

His most striking skills are, of course, the Astrophysics x2 and Stellar
Cartography. There are six Romulan missions based on these skills, but
until now it was somewhat problematic to build a deck around them, with the
only reliable (i.e., non-holographic) and useful sources of Astrophysics
being Dr. Reyga, Mirok, and Jo'Bril, with the last two being vulnerable to
Thought Fire. (Timicin is really only useful to beef up the point value of
the Fed/Klingon Test Mission, and Paul Manheim is too specialized to work
well in a tight Romulan deck.) Choices for Stellar Cartography were even
more limited: Dr. Reyga and the universal Tarus (who has no other skills).
In particular, the very tempting 45-point Romulan-only Investigate
"Shattered Space" was pretty hard to pull off.

Now you can use Telek R'Mor as your "first-string" Astrophysicist/Stellar
Cartographer, back him up with Mirok, Reyga, and a Tarus, and you'll have
more than enough SCIENCE and ENGINEER skills to get past all those nasty
ship-damaging and ship-stalling space dilemmas that require multiples of
those skills (Menthar Booby Trap, Two-Dimensional Creatures, Nitrium Metal
Parasites, Nanites, Ancient Computer...and the list goes on). You'll breeze
through any of the six Astro/SC missions; R'Mor can even complete Shattered
Space with the help of only Galen, Roga Danar or Nick Locarno.

And don't forget the Romulans are masters of espionage. R'Mor is a
great addition to an espionage deck because there are three Fed and three
Klingon missions requiring Astro and/or SC that he could help with (three
of them also require SCIENCE or ENGINEER).

His remaining "normal" skill is not so normal for a Romulan: Honor! How
about doing Wormhole Negotiations with Honor instead of Treachery? It's now
feasible for the Romulans. And though R'Mor is primarily a space-oriented
personnel, he would also come in very handy for completing Khitomer
Research.

As if that were not enough, he may be reported directly to any ship (note
the "may"--you can report him normally if you wish). Not only could you
send out your ship to do one of the simpler missions before he comes up,
then just drop him aboard when you draw him, regardless of their location;
you could report him aboard a ship under the influence of Quantum
Singularity Lifeforms, Menthar Booby Trap (if one ENGINEER already aboard),
or Two-Dimensional Creatures to cure any of them. Not quite a Devidian
Door, but useful nonetheless.

Of course, there's another way to report him, too. His AU icon lets him go
in a Cryosatellite, where you could pick him up (perhaps with Garak and
Commander Tomalak) after completing one of the simple missions with a
"backup" Tarus, then go on the the high-point missions. The AU icon also
makes him good for staffing the Decius (where you *could* back up his
Astrophysics with a Tomek or two) and doubly useful for Fissure Research.

How about his stats? INTEGRITY 7 is as high as any Romulan to date; CUNNING
7 slightly below average for a Romulan, but OK; and STRENGTH 7 is average
for a Romulan.

Finally, I have to speculate on whether there might even be a Captain's Log
in Telek R'Mor's future. He commanded the science vessel Talvath in "Eye of
the Needle"; I don't remember whether the ship was ever shown (I don't
think so, but I don't have a tape of the episode), but surely the universal
Science Vessel could be "doctored" to make it a 20-year-older model, and
finally have a unique ship of that class.

Aefvadh! Only one Anthology preview card is not a personnel; rather, an
unusual artifact, the first to come from Deep Space Nine. A glimpse of the
future, perhaps?


    @{b}ORB OF PROPHECY AND CHANGE@{ub}

    Rare Artifact

    Use as Equipment card. Once each turn, you may glance at the top card of
    your draw deck. Insert it anywhere within your draw deck if you wish.
    (Not duplicatable.)

@{i}"Third of the nine mysterious energy vortices called Tears of the Prophets
by the Bajorans. Grants visions of the future. Only Orb not stolen by the
Cardassians during the occupation."@{ui}


This acts a bit differently from other Artifacts. Because it used as an
Equipment card, it goes immediately into the Away Team when earned at a
completed mission. It doesn't have to be played from your hand later. But
it doesn't have to be "present" at any particular location or with anyone
or anything in order to be used. In effect, it *acts* like an Event that
plays on the table and then "allows" its effect to occur. But since it
doesn't play as an Event, it's immune to Kevin Uxbridge.

However, it *is* vulnerable to a Disruptor Overload. You could afford it
some protection by acquiring a Mona Lisa and keeping them together; this
should deter Disruptor Overloads, as they would risk losing 25 points if it
gets the wrong one. But there is a much simpler way to protect the Orb, at
least for now: Disruptor Overloads play on a ship or on an Away Team. They
do *not* play on an outpost. So...hustle your newly found Orb back to your
outpost (if not already there), and leave it behind. The only way for your
opponent to destroy it would be to destroy the outpost, so you might want
to drop a Plasmadyne Relay or two there. Watch out for Vorgon Raiders,
because they could steal it regardless of location.

Because the Orb is non-duplicatable, if your opponent seeds one also and
gets to his first, you're out of luck. When you complete your mission and
recover the Orb, it has to be discarded, because there can't be two in play.

Now, what is this Orb good for? Well, how many times have you wanted to
take a peek at what you're going to draw next, wondering if you should just
wait *one* more turn for a crucial personnel, ship, or interrupt to appear?
Can you take a chance on a Devidian Door coming up next? The Orb of
Prophecy and Change lets you do that.

But more than that, if what you see *isn't* something you need or can use
right now, it lets you bury it *anywhere* in your deck. If you will need it
in a couple of turns, you can custom-place it to come up whenever you want
it. If, on the other hand, you realize you have no use whatsoever for it in
this game (say, an anti-Fed card and your opponentis playing Klingons), put
it at the bottom of the deck.

A particular use of this feature might be if you are affected by a Static
Warp Bubble and are down to no cards in your hand. Check the top card
before your draw; if it's one that you would not be able to, or do not want
to, play on your next turn, but will want later, "delay" it by placing it
further down so you won't be forced to discard it. The next card might be a
similar situation, but you will have saved one card for later use.

A particularly good use of this card is in conjunction with playing a Q's
Tent for random retrieval. When you do this, not only do you not get a card
draw this turn, but you place the Q's Tent on top of your draw deck, so you
redraw it on your next turn. Maybe that's what you want, but what if you
want a "real" card draw instead, and want to retrieve the Q's Tent later?
Just put off glancing at the top card until after you've placed the Tent
back on your draw deck. Then when you look at it, you get to bury it
wherever you want, and your next card is a regular draw. Careful placement
of the tent within your deck will let you space out its re-use at whatever
intervals you desire.

One warning: watch out for Subspace Schisms! If you don't bury a card after
looking at it, your opponent can assume it's one you want to draw, and can
force you to lose it with a Schism.

The Major's Combos:

- Orb of Prophecy and Change + Q's Tent (what else?)

Aefvadh! Although the good Dr. R'Mor is the only truly green-bordered
preview card in the Anthology, there a couple more with definite green
tinges. We've already looked at Garak; here's the other one, with a unique
skill that was just made for the Rommies; and for comparison, I also

appropriate...

     Does not work with Federation affiliation.

@{i}"Natural leader kicked out of Starfleet Academy after the Nova Squadron
accident and cover-up of 2368."@{ui}


Similarities first. Both non-aligned, but only Tom is universally usable,
as Nick doesn't play well with Feds. Both CIVILIANS, good for Colony decks
or Kurlan Naiskos, especially needed by Romulans and Klingons.

They are the only personnel providing a compact Navigation x2 for red or
green decks, very important especially to Romulans, who have no universal
and only 5 unique personnel with Navigation, while Klingons have 2
universals and 6 uniques. (The Feds have Gibson, who is universal to boot,
plus lots of personnel with single Navigation.) Why is Navigation so
important? Well, there are dilemmas that require it, and FGC-47 Research is
tedious to get past without the span reduction provided by Navigation; and
they act as protection against Anti-Matter Pod damage; Nav x3 is heavy
requirement to meet without a Nav x2 aboard. Of course, they also both have
Transporter Skill, which can nullify the Pod entirely, but you may want to
just keep from getting damaged yourself, while leaving the Pod in place to
menace your opponent. Sonya Gomez can suspend the Pod's effect for Feds.

Transporter Skill has other uses, too, helping you past beaming
obstructions. Again, this is of less value to the Feds, who have Lefler and
Scotty with Transporter Skill.

Now let's look at their differences. Nick, who can't work with Feds, has
Computer Skill (useful to Klingons, Romulans have plenty), Youth (same
situation), and Leadership (both affiliations have plenty). He's not AU, so
while he doesn't require that open AU Door to come into play, he also can't
be stuffed in a Cryosatellite or used to provide AU icon staffing or
mission requirements.

Tom, however, has much more potential, even for Feds. His SECURITY skill
makes him highly useful to both Klingons and Romulans who are short on that
classification. And Treachery works for everyone--the Feds have very few at
all; the Klingons have J'Ddan and the Duras family, all with very low
Integrity (2-4), where Tom's is just passable at 5; and while the Romulans
have lots of Treachery, the more the merrier in a green "Treachery" deck.
Or, if your Romulans actually need Honor (Khitomer Research, anyone?),
switch him to Honorable mode. That trick isn't very useful to Klingons,
however, who are brimming over with Honor already, but aren't known for
"Honor" decks. Although his stats are lower than Nick's, they're still
usable, and he can go in a Cryosatellite.

To rank them on comparative usability, we find--
Thomas Paris: Best for Romulans, good for Klingons, OK for Feds
Nick Locarno: Good for Klingons (though not up to Tom's level), so-so for
              Romulans, unusable by Feds

The Major's Combos:

- Thomas Paris + Nick Locarno + Sela + FGC-47 Research = 30 points + Span of 2

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #25@{ub}


Aefvadh! The most important, and most confusing, new concept introduced in
the Q Continuum expansion was that of side decks. Let's attempt to unravel
the most confusing side deck so far, a bundle of dilemma-like cards with
some very un-dilemma-like features...


    @{b}Q CONTINUUM SIDE DECKS@{ub}

(Note: this entire discussion deals only with Q-icon Events, Interrupts,
and Dilemmas, and ignores the Q's Planet mission. Although it has a Q-icon,
and may be included in a Q-Continuum side deck, it does not work like the
other Q-icon cards and has a totally different purpose. I'll review it
separately, later.)

In your Q Continuum expansion packs, you will find cards labelled
Interrupt, Event, or Dilemma--but they don't look like like normal
Interrupts, Events, or Dilemmas. Instead of the distinctive Event and
Interrupt icons, or the planet/space icons of a normal Dilemma, they all
have green "Q" icons, and they all have a black background. In addition,
the text of these Events and Interrupts is decidedly peculiar when compared
to normal Events and Interrupts that you might play from your hand; they
don't sound like anything you would want to play (why would you want to
give your opponent points?)! What gives? To understand Q-icon cards, there
are two basic things you need to know:

- Q-icon cards can come into play in *only* one way: from a Q-Continuum
side deck. They may not be put in your play deck and played from the hand
like normal interrupts and events; they may not be seeded under missions
like normal dilemmas; they may not be placed in a Q's Tent.

- Q-icon cards, regardless of their card type, act more or less like
"dilemmas" that your *opponent* has to face. Unlike dilemmas, though, they
do not "stop" the crew or Away Team if not overcome (unless the card says
so).

To make a Q-Continuum side deck, select as many cards with the Q-icon as
you want, including as many duplicates as you want. No other cards can go
into the Q-Continuum side deck. These cards are in addition to the 60 cards
in your normal play deck. Shuffle the side deck and place it face down on
the table. Now what? You have to have some method of accessing the side
deck; it's done with the...


    @{b}Q-FLASH@{ub}

    Common Doorway

    "Place one atop Q-Continuum side deck during the seed phase. Q-Continuum
    is now open and in play. OR Seed under any mission like a dilemma. Any
    crew or Away Team encountering this Q-Flash must experience X cards from
    opponent's Q-Continuum, where X = the number of personnel present. OR
    Stock in deck and play to nullify one Q icon card."


While it may sound as though the three uses of this card are unrelated,the
first two must be used in tandem. You must include in the seed portion of
your 60-card deck *at least* two Q-Flash doorways. Seed one of them on top
of the side deck at the beginning of the seed phase. This "activates"
(opens) your Q-Continuum. If that doorway is closed during the game (e.g.,
by a Revolving Door), no more cards may come out of the Q-Continuum until
it is reopened.

Any further Q-Flash doorways in your seed deck are seeded under missions
(either planet or space), like dilemmas. You may seed only one under each
mission. If a second Q-Flash is discovered at a mission (i.e., if both you
and your opponent seeded one there), the second is discarded, just as
duplicate dilemmas at a single mission are discarded. Note that they are
doorways, not dilemmas; Q-Flashes may not be discarded by Senior Staff
Meeting or the Q dilemma, and the Q-Flash itself may not be nullified by Q2.

When your opponent attempts a mission and encounters a Q-Flash, count the
number of personnel present in his crew or Away Team. He must now face that
many cards from your Q-Continuum. Draw cards from your Q-Continuum one at a
time. Your opponent should read each card (it must be read from his point
of view, just like a dilemma) and resolve it before going on to the next.

If the same card comes up more than once during a single Q-Flash, the
duplicates are discarded, and are *not* replaced with more. Example: there
are 6 personnel in the Away Team, and you draw the following cards:
Amanda's Parents, Frigid, *Amanda's Parents, Mandarin Bailiff, *Mandarin
Bailiff, Penalty Box. The starred cards are discarded without effect, and
no more cards are drawn.

A few miscellaneous points to keep in mind:

- There is *no* way for you to encounter the cards in your own Q-Continuum.
A player *always* faces cards from his opponent's Q-Continuum when an Away
Team or crew he controls encounters a Q-Flash. For example, if you control
your opponent's Away Team with Alien Parasites, and the Away Team hits a
Q-Flash, you face cards from your opponent's Q-Continuum.

- If the entire crew/Away Team gets killed, relocated, captured, stopped,
or otherwise put out of commission so there is no one to continue, the
Q-Flash ends (draw no more cards).

- When a Q-icon card is discarded, it goes to its owner's discard pile (not
to the player encountering the Q-Flash) as usual, unless the card says
otherwise (i.e., Gift of the Tormentor).

- Some Q-icon Event cards say "play on (something) until any Q-Flash." This
means that the Event is discarded when any player encounters a seeded
Q-Flash, or plays a Q-Flash from his hand for any reason.

If these cards all act like little "dilemmas", and can't be played from the
hand, you may wonder why some of them are labelled as Events or Interrupts.
One word: nullifiers. While a few of the cards say that they may be
nullified by one card or another, or that they may *not* be nullified, it's
easy to lose sight of the fact that most of them may be nullified by the
standards: Amanda, Kevin, and Q2. Yes, a Q-icon Interrupt doesn't just
"play as an Interrupt"; it *is* an Interrupt. In addition, remember the
last use of the Q-Flash doorway.

- Amanda Rogers may nullify a Q-icon Interrupt. As with any other
Interrupt, it must be "just played"--that is, must have just come into play
during a Q-Flash. Once you have started to resolve the Interrupt, it's too
late to play Amanda.

- Kevin Uxbridge may nullify a Q-icon Event. As with other Events, it may
be played immediately, or later to nullify a Q-icon Event that plays on the
table or elsewhere. And don't forget Kevin Uxbridge: Convergence, which can
nullify Events, including Q-icon Events, that are located anywhere on the
spaceline (but not those played on the table).

- Q2, in addition to countering Amanda and Kevin, may nullify any
"Q-related dilemma." You can't get much more "Q-related" than a Q-icon
dilemma. (But Q-Flashes may not be nullified by Q2; they are doorways, even
though they are seeded like dilemmas and have "Q" in the title.)

- Q-Flash doorways may be included in your draw deck and played to nullify
any Q-icon card. Note that, while *you* could nullify a Q-icon card that
your opponent encounters, with Amanda, Kevin, or Q2, you could not
immediately nullify it with a Q-Flash, because you may only play a doorway
from your hand on your own turn.

Any of these nullifiers may be overridden by the card text (e.g., "may only
be nullified by..." means the standard nullifier won't work; some "may not
be nullified" by anything). Also, some cards may specify additional ways to
nullify that card; "may be nullified by..." means the standard cards work
as well.

No combos today, but I do have a table of "Q-Continuum Card Facts" on my
website (URL listed below). Unlike normal dilemmas, Q-icon cards can't be
interpreted with a flowchart. They're all different, so you just have to
follow the card text, which unfortunately isn't always crystal-clear. The
table lists all Q-icon cards with full game text; card type and bonus
points (if any); ways to nullify each card; and an expanded version of the
game text, interpreting in detail how the card works and when you discard
it, with examples where I felt they would be helpful. Keep the following in
mind:

- The card interpretations tell you how to apply the card to yourself, if
you encounter a Q-Flash and face the cards from your opponent's Q-Continuum.

- The normal dilemma rules for stopping, discarding, and leaving on the
mission do not apply to Q-icon cards. A Q-icon card stops the Away Team
only if the card says it does. Q-icon cards are never left on the mission
unless the card says it should be. In general, a Q-icon card is discarded
when the card says to do so.

I'll send out a text version of the table on the mailing list for those who
don't have web access.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #26@{ub}


Aefvadh! If you find, as Captain Janeway did, that time paradoxes make you
head ache, better get out the aspirin, because today's card is guaranteed
to generate paradoxes galore...


    @{b}SAMUEL CLEMENS' POCKETWATCH@{ub}

    Rare Artifact, AU Icon

    Place in hand until played as an Interrupt card. One action that must
    happen on your next turn (such as your card draw), happens now instead.

@{i}"This 19th century watch was discovered in a cave along with Data's head in
2369. After returning to the past, Clemens left the watch again to maintain
the timeline."@{ui}


This seems simple enough. You get to move up to this turn (which might be
your turn or your opponent's turn) something that must, under normal
circumstances, happen on your next turn. The key word here is "must." There
are lots of things that *could* happen on your next turn, but only a few
that *must* happen. If it's optional, you can't use the Pocketwatch to
advance it. If it's mandatory, or "scheduled" to happen, you can do it now
with the Pocketwatch.

What are some things that *must* happen on your next turn? They fall into a
few categories.

1. Your end-of-turn card draw is not optional. Unless some other card
prevents it, or the game ends first, when you end your next turn you will
be required to draw a card from your deck. If you use the Pocketwatch to do
it now, you don't get a card draw at the end of your next turn. It has
already happened. Now, if you happen to play a Q's Tent at the beginning of
your next turn, you don't get to draw a card at the end of that turn. Darn
shame.  ;-)

2. Two inexorable dilemmas, the Borg Ship and The Sheliak, must move at the
end of *every* turn (of both players). If it is now your turn and you play
SCP, that movement occurs now. Either dilemma would also move at the end of
*this* turn, and again at the end of your opponent's turn, but of course
will not move at the end of your next turn. A related case is Rogue Borg
Mercenaries. They battle a ship's personnel at the start of every turn, so
you could move up the battle that must happen on your next turn.

3. Some dilemmas or events require you to move a ship in pursuit of some
goal, to the exclusion of other actions. Cytherians, Conundrum, and
Incoming Messages fall in this category. SCP will allow you to make next
turn's required movement now. As with the Borg Ship, if you make the
movement now, it will be in addition to the movement you were required to
make for this turn, and you will not be able to move that ship on your next
turn, because you have already used next turn's RANGE. Thus, you would
generally want to accelerate such a required movement only if it allows you
to resolve the dilemma or Incoming Message on this turn,not just to get
closer to resolution.

4. Several dilemmas, events, and interrupts resolve with some action at the
end of a specified number of turns. If one of those countdown resolutions
is scheduled to happen on your next turn, you can make it happen now. This
includes Coalescent Organism (it might be advantageous to let the affected
personnel die now rather than later), Temporal Rift, Time Travel Pod, and
Anti-Time Anomaly. There are many more that fall in this category (e.g.,
Hyper-Aging, Nitrium Metal Parasites, Plasma Fire, Warp Core Breach,
Isabella), but I can't think of a good reason why you would want to
accelerate their resolution, since they will destroy your ship or kill your
personnel. If you can think of a reason, though, you can do it. Two points
to note here:
- You can *only* accelerate the actual resolution of such cards, not the
"countdown" itself; for example, if this is the third full turn that your
ship is stuck in a 5-turn Time Travel Pod, you can't play SCP and say that
it's one turn closer to resolution. No action occurs during the countdown,
only at the time of resolution.
- You can't accelerate the resolution of dilemmas that stop personnel in
order to unstop them. For one thing, normal "unstopping" is not considered
an action. For another, "stopping" lasts through the end of the turn on
which the personnel were stopped (or through the end of the later specified
turn). They become unstopped at the beginning of *the* next turn, which is
normally your opponent's turn (not "your" next turn).

5. Similar to the last category is the repair of a ship, or removal of a
Baryon Buildup. If the ship is scheduled to be completely repaired at the
end of your next turn (either at an outpost or with an Exocomp aboard), or
to have the Baryon Buildup removed at the beginning of your next turn
(i.e., you have returned to the outpost and evacuated the ship), you can
finish it off now with SCP. Again, you can't accelerate being
"half-repaired", just the final repair.

6. In addition to the obvious card draw, there are several other specific
actions that you might be required to take on your next turn as a result of
a card in play (usually an event).
- Interrogation. Interrogating your captive is not optional. Moving up a
1-point gain may seem trivial, but under the right circumstances, it could
win you a game. If you lose one measly point to The Higher...The Fewer and
then find yourself at 99, with one card left in your draw deck, that 1
point would make the difference between a full (2-point) and a timed
(1-point) tournament win.
- Distortion Field. Getting next turn's card flip now could get your Away
Team off a planet one turn early.
- Colony. You have an unopposed Away Team at the Colony now. They would
have to score points from the Colony at the beginning of your next turn.
Move up the scoring "action" to now with SCP. Could give you a win. Or if
not, now that you've scored the points, you can take your Away Team
elsewhere and maybe attempt another mission.
- Telepathic Alien Kidnappers. Get in an extra chance to make your opponent
discard a card before his next turn.
- Static Warp Bubble. If you are affected by this, you must discard a card
each turn...unless, of course, you have no cards in your hand todiscard.
Suppose the only card you have left is SCP. You can discard it...or you can
play it, moving up your forced discard from next turn. Guess what? You have
no card left to discard. And now you have to make *this* turn's forced
discard...and you have no card left to discard. Darn shame. Draw your card
to end this turn. On your next turn, you don't have to discard, even if you
don't play the card you just drew...because you already moved that discard
up.
- Showing a Devidian Door. If you have it in hand, show it now and avoid
potential problems, such as the possibility of having to discard it because
of a Static Warp Bubble or Telepathic Alien Kidnappers.

What sort of things *can't* you do with the Pocketwatch? Anything that is
optional. You aren't required to play a card on your turn, so you can't
move up your card play. You aren't required to move a ship (unless you are
affected by one of the cards in category 3), so you can't extend your ship
RANGE by using your RANGE from next turn. You aren't required to beam an
Away Team anywhere, so you can't, for example, beam up your Away Team
during your opponent's turn (to avoid being attacked).

You may note that some of the suggested uses of the Pocketwatch introduce
some interesting time paradoxes. For example, you can move up your card
draw, and then on your next turn, play a Q's Tent, so you are no longer
eligible for the card draw you already took. Your Away Team can leave the
Colony where you moved up the point-scoring, and by your next turn no
longer be there to score the points they already scored. You could make
your required move for Cytherians and score its points, and then before
your next turn, your opponent could destroy your ship, so it wouldn't have
been able to finish the dilemma if you had waited.

However, you don't need to worry about these paradoxes (after all, they
don't seem to worry about them in the Star Trek plots  ;-)  ). The rule for
what you can do is simple: if you are "currently scheduled" to do something
next turn, you can do it now instead. Even if something happens afterwards
that would have prevented it, it doesn't matter. The action has already
occurred.

This review wouldn't be complete without an assessment of the value of
Samuel Clemens Pocketwatch. It's pretty weak, as artifacts go. If you want
extra card draws, The Traveler is a better, longer-lasting, and cheaper
bet. If you want to extend your ship RANGE, Distortion of Space/Time
Continuum or Transwarp Conduit is better. A Spacedock will get your ships
repaired more quickly, and Amanda Rogers and Kevin Uxbridge are certainly
better for getting rid of unwanted Interrupts and Events. But when you
consider that it can be used for a variety of possible purposes, you can
see that its value lies in its versatility rather than in raw power. Still,
I'd have to think long and hard about using a deck slot for the Pocketwatch
instead of a Betazoid Gift Box or a Kurlan Naiskos, or even a good solid
dilemma.

[Thanks to Puff the Magic Dragon for raising some interesting questions and
ideas about what will and won't work.]

The Major's Combos:

- SCP plus Q's Tent. Get double duty out of your "no card draw" penalty.

- SCP plus...the subject of my next review. No, it's not something
mentioned in this article.  :-)

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #27@{ub}


Aefvadh! Last time I discussed a card that lets you do something early.
Here's a complementary card that lets you do something (maybe several
somethings) late...


    @{b}END TRANSMISSION@{ub}

    Common Interrupt

Play to immediately end your turn, delaying until the end of your next turn
everything which must happen at the end of this turn, including card draws.

@{i}"Subspace communications are sometimes abruptly terminated by the transmitter."@{ui}


Here is the flip side of Samuel Clemens' Pocketwatch. Instead of moving up
an action that would be more convenient for you to do now, you get to put
off something, or several things, that would be inconvenient right now.

Note that, although this is an interrupt, it may only be played on your own
turn, because that is all you can affect. You can't play this to affect
your opponent.

Once again we're looking at actions that *must* occur, with the added
restriction that they must occur at the *end* of your turn (not sometime
during your turn). What actions are included, and excluded, now?

1. Your end-of-turn card draw(s). The most likely reason you would want to
delay this is that it will run out your deck, and you aren't ready to do
that yet. Another turn may get you to 100 points to win the game. However,
because you are delaying *all* end-of-turn actions, this may simply be a
side effect of something else you want to delay. To minimize the effect of
an unwanted card draw delay, you could play a Q's Tent on this turn,
getting a card from your Tent and thus negating your card draw anyway.

2. The movement of the Borg Ship and The Sheliak. If your ship is stopped
or out of Range, or your Away Team is stuck on a planet, and you aren't
going to be able to get out in time, you can delay one or both of these
nasties. Be careful how you time this; don't forget that either dilemma
will still move at the end of your opponent's turn, and then two movements
must occur at the end of your next turn. So if your opponent got you with
the dreaded Sheliak-Q combination and The Sheliak are now sitting next
door, End Transmission won't save your Away Team, or the mission. Rogue
Borg Mercenaries aren't covered by End Transmission, because they battle at
the start of every turn.

3. Required-ship-movement cards (Cytherians, Conundrum, and Incoming
Messages) aren't affected by End Transmission. The movement occurs sometime
during the turn, and is not required to wait until the end.

4. Many dilemmas, events, and interrupts that resolve with some action at
the end of a specified number of turns can be usefully delayed for one full
turn. For example, you can put off a death by Coalescent Organism,
Hyper-Aging resolution, or ship destruction by Nitrium Metal Parasites for
one more turn. As with the Pocketwatch's acceleration, you can only delay
the actual resolution of such cards, not the "countdown" itself.

5. You *could* delay the repair of a ship, though I doubt that you would
want to. Just remember that if you play End Transmission for some other
reason, when a ship repair is scheduled to be finished, you *will* delay
its repair also.

6. End Transmission does not apply to most of the other miscellaneous
actions discussed with the Pocketwatch, because most of them don't occur at
the end of your turn. That includes Interrogation, the Distortion Field
card flip, scoring Colony points, Telepathic Alien Kidnappers guess, and
showing a Devidian Door. However, Static Warp Bubble discard does occur at
the end of the turn, so you could delay that, remembering that you will
have to discard two cards at the end of your next turn.

Most of the uses of End Transmission are simply to delay some bad effect,
to give you one more turn before everybody gets killed or your only ship
explodes, in which to score points, move your ship, or bring in a cure for
some disease. There is no reason why you couldn't play another one on that
next turn, to give yourself another reprieve.

There are a few other ways to do some of the things this card can do, in
one form or another. To unstop a ship and move it out of harm's way, you
could use a Distortion of Space/Time Continuum. Or you can play Hugh to
negate the attack of a Borg Ship. To keep from running out your deck, you
can just play a Q's Tent. But many of the effects (especially dilemmas)
cannot be stopped by any other means once set in motion. So End
Transmission has considerable versatility, and might be a worthy card for
your Q's Tent.

And what about the mystery combo promised last time? Actually, there are two.

The Major's Combos:

- Samuel Clemens' Pocketwatch plus End Transmission. You have something
that you really want to delay, like the resolution of a killer dilemma. But
you also really need your card play this turn (maybe you are desperate for
a MEDICAL to cure the dilemma). Play the Pocketwatch and take next turn's
card draw now. Then play End Transmission, delaying the dilemma resolution,
and this turn's card draw, to next turn.

- End Transmission plus Samuel Clemens' Pocketwatch. The scenario, courtesy
of Jason "Q" Winter: You have one card left in your draw deck.  Your
opponent is ahead 80-75. You play End Transmission. On his turn, he
attempts a mission and hits The Higher...The Fewer, losing 8 points. Before
the next dilemma, you play SCP to run out your deck.  You win, 75-72 ;-)

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #28@{ub}


Aefvadh! After a long hiatus (and no, I *wasn't* on vacation the whole
time!), I'm going to talk about the most mundane of card types. They're
common, they're boring, there are only four of them so far, you're
required
to have at least one in your deck (maybe more), and they seem to
generate
more questions than anything else except maybe dilemmas. Let's look
at...


    @{b}THE INS AND OUTS OF OUTPOSTS, PART 1: HOW MANY?@{ub}

ROMULAN (KLINGON, FEDERATION) OUTPOST

"Romulus is one of the two homeworlds for the Romulans. The Romulan Star
Empire establishes outposts throughout its territory."

"The Klingon Homeworld is Qo'noS. The Klingon Empire establishes
outposts throughout its territory."

"Earth is a member of the United Federation of Planets. The Federation
establishes outposts throughout its territory."

Common Outpost, Shields 32 (R, K) or 30 (F)

Seed one if playing Romulan (Klingon, Federation) OR build later at any
location where a Romulan (Klingon, Federation) ENGINEER is present.

NEUTRAL OUTPOST

"A common space station design used by many races for research or trade.
Personnel and ships from all affiliations are frequent visitors at such
facilities."

Common Outpost, Shields 24
Seed one at any Space location OR build later at a Space location where
any ENGINEER is present. No repairs here.


To understand the correct use of outposts, it's not enough to just read the
cards. Outposts are such a basic part of the game that many of the rules
governing their use are in the rulebook, back in the early pages that no
one ever refers to. In addition, the Neutral Outpost did not exist in the
premiere set, so a few rules had to be modified and clarified in the FAQ
when it appeared. Let's go back to basics, starting with:

1. How many outposts MAY you SEED, and of what affiliation?

THE most asked question about outposts. Two simple rules, and you must
satisfy both:
- You may seed one outpost for each affiliation you control.
"Non-aligned" is not an affiliation, so an outpost may not be seeded
based on non-aligned personnel in your deck.
- You may seed a maximum of one of each type of outpost, that is, one
Romulan, one Federation, one Klingon, one Neutral. A Neutral Outpost maybe
substituted for any one affiliated outpost. However, it is still Neutral
and may be used by any affiliation; it does not "become" Romulan if it is
substituted for a Romulan Outpost.

So, if you are playing Romulan, you may seed one outpost, either Romulan or
Neutral. If you are playing Romulan and Federation, you may seed two
outposts, in one of the following combinations:
     1 Romulan, 1 Federation
     1 Romulan, 1 Neutral
     1 Neutral, 1 Federation

You are not required to seed the maximum number of outposts; in fact, you
may seed no outposts at all if you have another way to play personnel.

Remember, these restrictions apply only to *seeding* outposts--placing them
during the seed phase. You may *build* as many outposts as you wish, of any
appropriate affiliation, during the game; building an outpost counts as
your card play.

2. How many outposts MUST you include in your deck?

The opposite side of the first question, and becoming more frequently asked
as affiliations proliferate. One rule here:

- You MUST include at least one outpost in your deck for each affiliation
you decide to control.

So if you play Romulan, Klingon, and Federation, with or without treaties,
you must include at least three outposts in your deck. They don't have to
be seeded; they can be in your draw deck, and you are not required ever to
build them.

3. What does it mean to "control an affiliation"?

You control an affiliation by including at least one non-outpost card
(personnel or ship) of that affiliation in your 60-card deck. Cards in a
side deck do not count, but seeded personnel (e.g., in a Cryosatellite, or
Mirasta Yale) do.

4. How do dual-affiliation personnel fit into this equation?

That depends on whether you want to maximize your seeded outposts, or
minimize the number of slots taken by outposts in your deck. Depending on
your strategy, you may want to do either. Regardless, here's what you do:

- Before the seed phase begins, decide on an affiliation for each personnel
in your deck. (For single-affiliation personnel, obviously you have no
choice.) Based on the affiliations selected:
- You MAY seed one outpost for each affiliation. (You may seed fewer.)
- You MUST include one outpost in your deck for each affiliation. (You may
include more.)

Important: The affiliation you select for a personnel at this time has NO
bearing on what affiliation you assign them when you report them for duty,
or how you may use them during the game.

Here are some examples of how many outposts I must include, and how many I
may seed, if my deck contains *only* the listed personnel.

- Tomalak and Roga Danar. I must include at least one outpost in my deck. I
may seed one outpost (R or N). Roga Danar has no affiliation and neither
requires that I include an outpost for him, nor allows me to seed a
second outpost.

- Tomalak and Major Rakal. If I decide Major Rakal is Romulan at seed time,
I must include one outpost in my deck, and I may seed one outpost (R or N).
Major Rakal may still be switched to Federation mode during the game if I
wish. If I decide Major Rakal is Federation at seed time, I must include
two outposts in my deck, and may seed up to two outposts (R+F, R+N, or
F+N). Major Rakal may still be reported for duty as a Romulan, at either a
Romulan or Neutral Outpost.

- Tomalak, Major Rakal, and Garak. If the affiliations are:
     R         R              C     seed max of 2 (must be R+N)
     R         F              C                 3 (must be R+F+N)
     R         R              N                 1 (R)
     R         F              N                 2 (R+F, R+N, or F+N)
(The outpost seeded for a Cardassian Garak must be a Neutral Outpost at
this time, because there are no Cardassian Outposts yet. A non-aligned
Garak does not allow seeding an outpost.)

- Major Rakal. I may seed only one outpost, regardless of the affiliation I
choose. She must be one or the other at any given time; she cannot be both
at once.

- Tomalak, Gowron, Jean-Luc Picard, and Roga Danar. I must include at least
three outposts in my deck, and may seed a maximum of three.

- Tomalak, Gowron, Jean-Luc Picard, and Garak. I MUST include at least
three outposts in my deck (if Garak is non-aligned at seed time), but I MAY
seed a maximum of four (if Garak is Cardassian at seed time).

- Tomalak, Gowron, Jean-Luc Picard, Garak, and Quark Son of Keldar. For
now, same as the last example: at least three required (if Garak =N and
Quark SOK =K), but my maximum seed is still four--because there are only
four outpost types available and seeding of two Neutral Outposts is not
allowed. When either Cardassian or Ferengi Outposts become available, I
could seed five.

- Gul Dukat and Garak. OK, I'm extrapolating here; Gul Dukat doesn't exist
yet in the game, but let's assume the first version of our favorite Gul is
pure Cardassian affiliation (not C/N like Garak), and that by then a
Cardassian Outpost is available (both good bets). I may seed ONE outpost,
either Cardassian or Neutral. But, you say, Garak is dual-affiliation; why
doesn't he permit the second outpost like Makor Rakal does for the
Romulans? Because in Garak's case, "dual affiliation"is a bit of a
misnomer. His second "affiliation" is not an affiliation; it's non-aligned.
So with just these two personnel, you still have only one affiliation in
your deck.

In Part 2, I'll look at other common outpost questions, including where you
can establish them, where they are located, how their Shields work, and
what you can do at a Neutral Outpost.


The Major's Combos:

- I think there were quite enough combos back there.  :-)

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #29@{ub}


Aefvadh! Now that we've figured out how many of the blasted things we MAY
seed and how many we MUST include in our decks, we can move on to...


    @{b}THE INS AND OUTS OF OUTPOSTS, PART 2: EVERYTHING ELSE@{ub}

First, a repeat of the important card text, minus the lore, just for quick
reference:

ROMULAN (KLINGON, FEDERATION) OUTPOST

Common Outpost, Shields 32 (R, K) or 30 (F)
Seed one if playing Romulan (Klingon, Federation) OR build later at any
location where a Romulan (Klingon, Federation) ENGINEER is present.

NEUTRAL OUTPOST

Common Outpost, Shields 24
Seed one at any Space location OR build later at a Space location where any
ENGINEER is present. No repairs here.

BTW, I've had some questions about the source of the "must include" outpost
rule. It's at the bottom of page 6 in the original rulebook.

Now on to the questions.

1. Where can you establish an outpost?

Affiliated outposts may be established either at space or planet locations.
But the mission must have a matching affiliation icon. You can't place a
Romulan Outpost at a Klingon-only mission.

Neutral Outposts may be established only at space locations, but that can
be *any* space mission. Because a Neutral Outpost has no affiliation icon,
the mission obviously cannot and does not have to have a matching icon, and
in fact you may place a Neutral Outpost at one of the universal Space or
Nebula mission cards. But beware: crew or ships at an outpost at a
universal Nebula will have to face a dilemma (if any are there) if your
opponent scores points.

You may establish an outpost either at your own mission or one of your
opponent's, as long as it has an appropriate affiliation icon. More than
one outpost may be placed at the same mission location, either two of your
own or yours and your opponent's.

These placement restrictions apply both to seeded outposts and those built
later.

2. Where are outposts located?

Not as straightforward as it may seem. Although it is commonly thought that
an outpost at a planet mission location is located *on* the planet,
(especially considering that the images on all the affiliated outpostsshow
planetary scenes), it just isn't so. The most recent FAQs have defined
outposts as being located in space, whether they are at a space or planet
mission location.

The implications of this definition are that (1) to get your Away Team to a
planet mission from an outpost, they must beam (or land a shuttle); and (2)
ships can be docked at the outpost, so personnel do *not* have to beam to
get from the outpost to a ship.

3. How do outpost shields work?

Outpost shields have two functions. First, they protect the outpost itself
from destruction by attacking ships, similar to the manner in which ship
shields protect a ship; but unlike a ship, an outpost cannot be "damaged"
or "repaired." If an attacking force targets an outpost with total Weapons
that are greater than the outpost's Shields, the outpost is destroyed,
along with all personnel and equipment aboard. (It does not require more
than double the Shields, as a ship does.) If the attacking Weapons are less
than or equal to the outpost's Shields, the attack has no effect other than
"stopping" all cards involved (including the outpost itself). Outpost
shields may be enhanced by Plasmadyne Relays, but not by Nutational or
Metaphasic Shields, which are limited to ships.

The second function of outpost shields is to protect ships docked at the
outpost, by extending 50% of the outpost shields to each docked ship. A
Romulan ship with Shields of 8 docked at a Romulan Outpost will gain 16
Shields from the outpost for a total effective Shields of 24. Any number of
docked ships may be protected in this way, without reducing the outpost's
own shield protection. If for some reason you don't want a ship to be
protected while at an outpost, you may declare the ship not docked and
"outside the shields." If you have two outposts at a mission location, you
must choose which outpost each ship is docked at; a ship cannot be
protected by the shields of two outposts at once.

An affiliated outpost may protect only ships of that affiliation and
non-aligned ships, unless a treaty is in force. A Neutral Outpost may
protect both non-aligned and affiliated ships. An outpost may protect only
ships belonging to the outpost's owner.

4. What can and can't you do at affiliated and Neutral Outposts?

At an affiliated outpost, you can report for duty ships and personnel of
that affiliation, and non-aligned ships and personnel. Damaged ships of
that affiliation only (*not* non-aligned) may be repaired there by keeping
them at the outpost for two full turns. If an appropriate treaty is in
effect, personnel and ships of the other affiliation in the treaty may also
report there, and their ships may be repaired there. The only way to repair
non-aligned ships at any outpost is to play a Spacedock event on the
outpost.

At a Neutral Outpost, you may report for duty personnel and ships of any
affiliation, and non-aligned. However, personnel of different affiliations
may not be present aboard the Neutral Outpost at the sametime without a
treaty. No ship repairs at all may be done at a Neutral Outpost, unless a
Spacedock event is played on the outpost.

5. How do you attempt a mission from an outpost?

A space mission may be attempted from the outpost just as you attempt it
from a ship: the entire crew aboard the outpost is involved in the mission
attempt and vulnerable to dilemmas. You cannot segregate part of the crew
so they are not part of the attempt. Any dilemma which "plays on ship"
(e.g., Tsiolkovsky Infection), or whose effect is on the ship itself rather
than on the crew (e.g., Null Space) is nullified and discarded if
encountered by a crew attempting the mission from the outpost. A ship
docked at the outpost will not be affected if its crew is not attempting
the mission.

A planet mission cannot actually be attempted "from the outpost" because an
Away Team must always beam to the planet for the mission attempt. However,
they may beam from the outpost rather than from the ship. This is an
important distinction for the Alien Parasites dilemma, because a
Parasites-infested Away Team that beamed from the outpost cannot take over
a ship even if it is docked at the outpost.

The Outpost Raid dilemma has its "If at your outpost" effect if your
outpost is *located* at the mission site, regardless of whether you
attempted it from, or beamed to the planet from, the outpost or a ship.

The Major's Combos:

- Neutral Outpost + Spacedock (mundane but utilitarian)

- Any outpost + Gul Madred + Interrogation = extra points

- Your opponent's outpost + Outpost Raid = a double kill, your choice

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #30@{ub}


Aefvadh! They promised us something for the Romulans in Fajo, and here
she is...


    @{b}TALLERA@{ub}

    Romulan/Federation/Non-aligned Personnel, unique,
    Limited Edition, (Fajo Collection)

    Integrity 3, Cunning 7, Strength 7, Command Star

SECURITY: Computer Skill, SCIENCE, Mindmeld, Leadership, Treachery
Does not work with [Federation] affiliation personnel.

@{i}"Female Romulan mercenary. In reality a physically altered Vulcan
isolationist seeking the Stone of Gol."@{ui}


Not *quite* the "six-skilled Romulan" that we've been hearing persistent
rumors of, but she *is* the first triple-affiliation personnel (granting
that "affiliation" is a misnomer for Non-aligned, as with Garak). Her
Non-aligned icon lets her work with the Klingons, as well as the
upcoming Cardassians, or anyone else--except of course the Feds.

Now, what good is her Federation icon, if she can't work with Feds?
Well, note that her restriction box reads just a little bit different
than those of Galen or Nick Locarno; while they won't work with
Federation *affiliation*, Tallera won't work with Federation affiliation
*personnel*. That means that, like Major Rakal, she could fly a
Federation ship, and more important, attempt a Federation mission, with
appropriate NA support crew. Of course, she also enables the seeding of
a second outpost like the other dual-affiliates.

With Tallera, the Romulans add another dual-classification personnel to
the fold. The combination of SECURITY and SCIENCE is an odd one, but
might prove useful: many dilemmas require either MEDICAL + SCIENCE or
MEDICAL + SECURITY to pass, with Barclay's Protomorphosis Disease
requiring all three. So a single MEDICAL with Tallera can pass a
considerable number of killer dilemmas. And she enables a couple of
unique Kurlan Naiskos combos (see below).

Her other skills, for the most part, are nothing spectacular. Computer
Skill and Treachery are common enough among Romulans and Non-aligned
(though to be sure they are required by plenty of Romulan missions), and
Leadership is mainly useful in allowing her to lead in battle. But her
remaining skill is so far unique outside of the blue cards. Yes, Tallera
finally brings "Mindmeld for the rest of us." Now I'll have to work up a
Mindmeld strategy for the Romulans, something I've never been able to
even consider before. (Let's see, she can gain Treachery from almost any
Rommie...) And oh, yes, she overcomes Interphasic Plasma Creatures, too.

Her attributes, unfortunately, are pretty lackluster. She's a sitting
duck for Firestorm, Thought Fire, and Hunter Gangs, and a STRENGTH of 7
isn't great for a Romulan. (An interesting side note: the Vulcan Stone
of Gol would kill Tallera, Narik, and Vekor (all CUNNING 7), while
sparing Galen (8).)

Ironically, her NA icon actually makes her more useful to the Klingons
than to the Romulans. They gain access to Mindmeld, and now have someone
they can use to "espionage" both Federation and Romulan missions, while
Tallera adds nothing there that the Romulans don't already have. And the
Klingons have more need for Treachery and Computer Skill than do the
Rommies.

The Major's Combos:

- Tallera + Taris + Major Rakal + Kareen Brianon + Decius + Kurlan
Naiskos

- Tallera + Ja'rod + Kurn + K'chiQ (with MEDICAL skill) + IKC Feh'lhr +
Kurlan Naiskos

- Tallera + Galen + Baran + Narik + Vekor + Mercenary Ship (just for the
heck of it; but I count at least 11 missions this team could do, though
a couple will need a Mindmeld, and several more if you add Roga Danar)

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #31@{ub}


Aefvadh! Way back in Review #1, I promised to look at Romulan and non-
aligned personnel, including comparisons using my own rating system.
Alert readers may have noticed that the rating system hasn't yet
materialized. For those who have been breathlessly awaiting its advent
(as well as the other 99% of you), you need hold your breath no longer.
Without further ado, I present...


    @{b}MAJOR RAKAL'S STCCG PERSONNEL RATING SYSTEM@{ub} (@{"The Ratings" link "STCCG:romreview.guide/RATINGS"}

We all have opinions on whether one personnel is better than another.
For a long time, Data was considered by many to be "the best" personnel
in the game. Jean-Luc Picard had his fans as well. Now that the other
affiliations have acquired better personnel, some think that Mogh or Dr.
Telek R'Mor are strong contenders for "the best". But these are
subjective opinions at best, and heavily dependent on your preferred
affiliation and strategies. I wanted to develop a more objective method
of determining the relative values of different personnel. Not
surprisingly, the ratings include the attributes, skills, and other
features (e.g., command stars, AU icons, species, etc.) of each
personnel.

Attributes

This was the simplest part of the ratings to calculate. CUNNING and
STRENGTH points count directly as rating points, while INTEGRITY points
are weighted twice as heavily. Attributes of I6-C8-S7 would thus be
worth 27 ratings points (2x6 + 8 + 7).

I double-weighted the INTEGRITY because it is the most difficult
attribute to enhance. CUNNING and STRENGTH are easily enhanced with
PADDs, Phasers, and Disruptors, Yellow Alert, and Lower Decks, while
INTEGRITY is enhanced only by Lower Decks and no equipment. INTEGRITY
points are thus more valuable because there are so few ways to
compensate for their lack. INTEGRITY is also the only attribute for
which an *individual* lack will get a personnel killed by a dilemma
(Firestorm); dilemmas requiring CUNNING or STRENGTH depend on an Away
Team total, so individual lacks can be compensated for by sheer numbers.

Regular Skills

While I originally planned to use skill values derived from both supply
and demand for skills, I eventually settled on demand-based skill
values. I consider that the demand for a skill is an effective measure
of the skill's value; if MEDICAL skill is called for 28 times to
overcome dilemmas or solve missions, it is almost 5 times as valuable as
Exobiology, which is called for only 6 times. The supply of each skill,
on the other hand, is irrelevant to determining the skill's value; just
because Taris added one to the supply of MEDICAL personnel does not make
the skill any less valuable to Takket.

Furthermore, a given skill may be more or less valuable to different
affiliations, depending on the relative demand for that skill within
each affiliation. Treachery, for example, is needed in 25 instances for
Romulans, making it twice as valuable to them as to the Federation, who
need it in only 11 instances. Why should Federation personnel be valued
for a Treachery skill that they have relatively little use for--they
can't solve Romulan-only missions! (The differences in demand come
mostly from mission requirements.) Accordingly, I have determined for
each skill a value for each affiliation. Non-aligned personnel have
three ratings, one for their value to each of the three main
affiliations.

The demand (i.e., the value) for each regular skill (including
classifications) was determined by counting the number of times the
skill is called for as a mission requirement, dilemma condition or cure,
or other use. For example, Expose Covert Supply requires Treachery x3 +
Navigation; this generates a demand of 3 for Treachery and 1 for
Navigation. Zaldan can be overcome by Treachery x2, among other possible
conditions, so it generates a demand of 2 for Treachery. The Charybdis
requires the presence of Archaeology to acquire artifacts, generating a
demand of 1 for Archaeology. If a skill has negative consequences in a
particular situation, such as Empathy which is selected to be killed by
Empathic Echo, it has a demand of -1. Only missions with matching
affiliation icons were counted in determining the demand/value for each
affiliation.

Special Skills and Restrictions

Mission and dilemma requirements naming a specific personnel (such as
Gowron) were considered special skills, rather than as a "demand". I
assigned values to special skills and restrictions mostly subjectively
and somewhat arbitrarily. The ability to nullify a specific dilemma (or
being named as part of the conditions to overcome a dilemma) was worth 5
points. Being named as a mission requirement was worth 10 or 15 rating
points, depending on whether the named personnel could solve the mission
alone or required additional skills and attributes, and on the point
value of the mission.

Bonus points for use of a personnel were generally converted into rating
points, e.g., Samuel Clemens' bonus points are worth 10 rating points.

A skill that enhances attributes of other personnel is worth the number
of attribute points gained by a typical Away Team of 6, with an
INTEGRITY boost being doubled as in the initial calculation of attribute
points. If the skill enhances a specific second personnel (or if a
specific personnel must be present for the first to be enhanced
himself), the points were divided between the two personnel.

Other special skills and restrictions not covered here were assigned
values based on my subjective evaluation of their usefulness.

Quasi-Skills

Certain features of personnel may be considered quasi-skills, and the
demand calculated in much the same way as regular skills, though some of
the "demands" are implied rather than explicitly stated, or may simply
represent an advantage. Quasi-skills include AU icons (required for
Fissure Research and seeding in a Cryosatellite), gender (females
required to pass Matriarchal Society, but a drawback for Female's Love
Interest), and species and affiliation (Cardassians are immune to
Cardassian Trap; Klingons are affected by a number of special cards;
androids are required to pass some dilemmas, immune to several more, and
targeted by still others).

Holograms, non-aligned affiliation, and universal icons fall in this
category, but my value assignments in these cases were partly based on
objective demand (e.g., hologram immunity to DNA-related dilemmas) and
partly subjective, for their versatility and restrictions which are not
easily quantifiable.

Multi-affiliation personnel are a special case. They are assigned a
rating value normally for each separate affiliation, with a 10-point
bonus for the versatility granted by multiple affiliations.

The Ratings

The actual current personnel ratings, including all personnel released
to date through First Anthology (plus Tallera), will be found in a
separate document entitled Major Rakal's Personnel Ratings. Personnel in
each affiliation are listed in descending order of rating, with non-
aligned personnel included in each affiliation's listing, as their
values to the affiliations differ. In addition, the non-aligned
personnel are listed in alphabetical order with all three affiliation
ratings for comparison. Finally, a listing of skills and quasi-skills
and their demand values for each affiliation is included at the end.
Special skills and restrictions are not included because of their large
number and variability.

So how do these (mostly) objective ratings compare to your subjective
opinions? You'll have to decide that for yourself, but here are some of
my impressions. First, much to my surprise, Sirol (139) came out on top
of the Romulans, with Dr. Telek R'Mor (120) trailing by a full 19
points. This is due to the fact that Sirol's Diplomacy, Treachery, and
Navigation are in greater demand than R'Mor's Honor, Astrophysics x2, or
Stellar Cartography. Major Rakal (82) comes in 6th among the Romulans
themselves, behind Sela and even Pardek, and only 20th if you include
non-aligneds. Tal Shiar may be a handy skill for solving Quash
Conspiracy or attacking other Romulans, but overall the demand is very
low, while Diplomacy is in high demand even for Romulans.

In the Federation, Geordi (152) edges out Data (147) with his double
ENGINEER skill, and Rachel Garrett has the edge over Jean-Luc, again
from her highly valued ENGINEER skill and her AU icon. Major Rakal in
Federation mode is almost equal at 80 to her Romulan mode, and much
better than her persona, Deanna Troi (69). Over in the Klingon Empire,
Governor Worf (151) is right up there with Geordi, with Mogh (133) the
second-ranking Klingon. Dathon is the only non-aligned in the overall
top 10, appearing twice at 133 for the Klingons and 128 for the Feds.

It's interesting to note that only 7 of the top 20 personnel in the
Federation list are non-aligned, while they account for 12 of the
Klingons' top 20 and 14 of the Romulans'. Just an indication of how
crucial non-aligned personnel may be to Romulan and Klingon decks.

Of course, I've finished this just about in time for First Contact to
make the entire system obsolete. It remains to be seen just how the Borg
will fit into this system; if they don't solve missions, there must be
some other demand for their skills (whatever they may be) to which I can
assign a value.

Warnings!

First, any rating system is inherently arbitrary. I made a number of
assumptions in designing this system, the biggest being that "demand"
for a skill for solving a missions is worth the same as "demand" for
overcoming dilemmas, leading in battle, or enabling an interrupt or
equipment card. You may not agree with this, and indeed the balance may
change when the battle enhancement expansion appears, for example, or
even for the Borg. But it will have to do for now.

Second, please keep in mind that these ratings are based largely on
overall demand for specific skills within each affiliation, and that
much of the demand for certain skills comes from mission requirements.
The actual value of a personnel in your deck depends a great deal on the
missions that you choose to play. Dr. Telek R'Mor ranks very high among
the Romulans, but his strength is largely for selected space missions;
if you play a Treachery/Archaeology planet deck, he will be virtually
useless. And while Geordi and Data are valuable for their ENGINEER skill
because the Federation has many missions requiring that skill, they will
be considerably less useful in a Diplomacy deck.

Third, remember that assigning values to special skills is not exactly a
scientific process. You may disagree heartily with my assessment of the
value of such skills. If you find a particular personnel's skills to be
valuable to you with your choice of deck design and strategy, and with
the opponents you regularly face, then my rating is irrelevant to you.
Use what works for you.

Finally, please do not ask me to justify or explain individual personnel
ratings, or the value of special or quasi-skills. (I'm not positive I
can justify all of them even to myself. ;-) ) Up to a dozen or more
individual factors enter into a single personnel rating, some of which
may not be immediately evident because they are not on the personnel
card. For example, Ba'el gets a small bonus because she can score double
points at a Colony built before mission completion by Gi'ral and Tokath;
Mortal Q can be killed by Calamarain or nullified by Immortal Again (two
negative "demands"); several rather obscure personnel get a Captain's
Log bonus. And many of the special and quasi-skill values are at least
partly subjective, for want of any better way to establish value. Not to
mention that I may have simply overlooked an obscure demand here and
there, though the effect should be minimal.

Acknowledgements

The weighting factor for the INTEGRITY attribute was inspired by Mark
Sidloi's ship rating system, which also incorporates weighting factors
for RANGE, WEAPONS, and SHIELDS based on their ease of enhancement.

The basic system of determining demand for a regular skill, including
"negative demand", is based on the system used by Wesley Crusher (Helge
Blohmer) for his Personnel Evaluation System.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #32@{ub}


Aefvadh! All indications were that there was another great Romulan card
lurking in the Fajo Collection, and it seems lurking may be just the
word, because it turns out to be those treacherous...


    @{b}SISTERS OF DURAS@{ub}

    Romulan/Klingon Personnel, unique,
    Limited Edition (Fajo Collection)

    Integrity 2+2, Cunning 8+8, Strength 8+7, Staff Star/Staff Star

Lursa: V.I.P.: Treachery, Leadership, Geology, Greed
B'Etor: V.I.P.: Treachery, Physics, Youth, Greed
Do not work with Klingons who have Honor.

@{i}"@{b}Lursa@{ub} and @{b}B'Etor@{ub}, like their father before them, collaborated with the
Romulan Star Empire."@{ui} ["Lursa" and "B'Etor" are in bold-faced type,
indicating they are personas of the separate sisters.]


Yes, our newest Romulans are Klingons! And in a neat twist, you get two
personnel for the card-draw and card-play price of one.

How do they stack up to their separate personas? Almost identical; the
Command stars on the separate "ladies" are downgraded to Staff stars
here (so you'll need another Command star to fly a capital ship with
them), and B'Etor loses Leadership (not to worry, Lursa still has hers
so they can lead in battle). The separates have no restriction on what
Klingons they can work with. Everything else is the same.

Now, where Tallera actually may be more useful to the Klingons than the
Romulans (without even possessing a Klingon icon), these bad Sisters are
more useful to the Romulans than to their own countrymen. An excellent
fit for a Romulan Treachery deck, the Sisters fill the "keynote skill
x2" gap for the Romulans at last: whereas the Feds have always had a
Diplomacy x2 (Picard and others), and the Klingons have had two Honor x2
since AU and the Two-Player Game (Governor Worf and Mogh), until now the
Romulans have had no Treachery x2 to make Wormhole Negotiations a snap.
Sure, the two Treachery are on two personnel, but it's still only one
card. In addition, they enable a lovely Romulan strategy for a certain
high-point mission (see The Major's Combos).

For the Klingons, on the other hand, they will have much more limited
use, simply because of that restriction box: "Do not work with Klingons
who have Honor." That doesn't leave them all that many options for
support crew; brother Duras, daddy Ja'rod, nephew Toral, and a few
others, but all the big hitters for the Klingons have Honor. They will,
of course, allow the seeding of an extra outpost, and they could
espionage Romulan missions with NA support, but unless this or a pure
Klingon Treachery deck is what you have in mind, you'll probably want to
forgo that card advantage and use the old Lursa and B'Etor in your
Klingon deck.

Make no mistake, there will be some disadvantages even for the Romulans.
Oh, they can pass Matriarchal Society alone, and have exceptional
CUNNING and STRENGTH for a single card (but even together they can't
survive a Firestorm--now that's *bad*). But, since it seems likely that
anything that happens to one sister will have to happen to the other
(you certainly can't discard only *one* of them), a killer dilemma or a
Female's Love Interest will lose both of them for you. But all in all, a
cool card, and one that I'll be happy to play in my Romulan decks.

Tentatively I will assign them values in my Personnel Rating System of
111 for Klingon use, and 134 for Romulan use. (This compares to 62 for
Lursa and 80 for B'Etor for a total of 142 for the separate sisters,
Klingon use only of course.) The rating is tentative because I want to
give more thought to the advantages and disadvantages of this cool 2-in-
1 combination; it's going to take time to investigate all the
implications. But basically, I treated the card as a "super personnel"
with one VIP classification (since so far two VIPs are never required,
the second is redundant and without value), two Staff stars (which *are*
useful), and with skills of Treachery x2, Greed x2, Leadership, Geology,
Physics, and Youth...and guess what, there's our 6-skilled Romulan, at
last.

The Major's Combos:

- Sisters of Duras + Major Rakal + Sela + Maques + Diplomatic
Conference. One outpost required, no waiting.  :)

- Sisters of Duras + I Am Not A Merry Man (they sure aren't). Q-icon
nullification for the Romulans!

Aefvadh! Well, Wesley beat me to this one last night (how'd you get
those ratings so fast, Wes?  :-)  ) while I was writing up my favorite
Fajo card (Sisters of Duras), but I still just have to review him,
because he's yet another that's so perfect for the Romulans...


    @{b}LORE@{ub}

    Non-aligned Personnel, unique,
    Limited Edition (Fajo Collection)

    Integrity 1, Cunning 13, Strength 12, Command Star, Nemesis Icon
CIVILIAN: ENGINEER, Computer Skill, Treachery x2, SECURITY, Transporter
Skill, Leadership, Doubles all Rogue Borg and Crystalline Entities in play.
Does not work with [Federation] affiliation.

@{i}"Evil Soong-type android. Data's "elder brother.""@{ui}


Lore really should almost have a green border. With his Treachery x2,
he'll make the perfect companion for the Sisters of Duras to complete
Wormhole Negotiations, and with a Disruptor they'll make short work of
Strategic Diversion, too. He even takes on Zaldan alone. His CUNNING of
13, the highest in the game, and STRENGTH of 12, matching Data's, give a
great boost to a compact Away Team in getting past dilemmas like Shaka,
Ferengi Attack, Hidden Entrance, and Nausicaans, as well as for solving
a number of missions with CUNNING requirements. Unfortunately, like so
many Romulans, his odd CUNNING leaves him vulnerable to Hunter Gangs,
and his stunningly low INTEGRITY of 1 makes him instant Firestorm fuel
(though his CUNNING will get him through Thought Fire).

The first triple-classification personnel, Lore will provide an
alternative, backup, and/or supplement to the much-used Roga Danar
SECURITY-ENGINEER combo, with a CIVILIAN thrown in for good measure for
Colony points. Like Roga, he can lead an Away Team battle; with any
luck, there will be more uses for Transporter Skill in future
expansions.

His most interesting skill is the special one of doubling Rogue Borg and
Crystalline Entities. Although this skill has yet to be explained fully,
it seems fairly obvious that he must double the STRENGTH of Rogue Borg
Mercenaries (as Crosis does), though he's a two-edged sword because he
doubles not only your Rogue Borg but your opponent's as well.

Because Crystalline Entity already kills the entire crew or Away Team,
the only features that can be doubled are the conditions, and the
points. Until now I have tended to ignore Crystalline Entity, because
while its planet requirements are not bad (a slightly scaled-down
Barclay's), the space conditions of SHIELDS >6 (or Music) meant it
wouldn't get much outside of K'Vorts. Lore will make it worthwhile to
get Crystalline Entity back out of the binder, by raising the space
requirement to SHIELDS >12 and making this deadly to most crews not at
an outpost (and it's such a neat fit with the storyline, too). Again, a
double-edged sword that should do a lot to encourage the use of
Plasmadyne Relays and/or Metaphasic or Nutational Shields.

What else? He's an android, immune to the usual DNA-related dilemmas and
vulnerable to the usual android-hosers, reportable for free under
Cybernetics skill and considerably more useful than a generic STA. He
can't choose his classification, but when you've got three of them
already, you don't need to.

While he can't work with the Feds (who have plenty of androids already),
he'll be quite happy with the Klingons, giving them a much-needed
ENGINEER, CUNNING the likes of which they have never seen, and a very
useful source of Treachery with no restrictions on who he can work with,
such as the Sisters of Duras have.

One liability if you're playing opponents who like Q Continuum side
decks: with 7 red-dot skill icons, if he's selected for a Mandarin
Bailiff, it'll cost you a 14-point differential (+7 to your opponent, -7
to you) to bail him out.

My tentative personnel rating for Lore is--are you ready for this?--159
for Klingon use, and a whopping 175 for Romulan use! Yes, Lore just blew
the top off my rating scale, piling up points for the coveted ENGINEER
and SECURITY and the Treachery x2, as well as his phenomenal CUNNING and
STRENGTH. Of course, he's worth 0 for Federation use, as his restriction
box won't let him work with a Fed crew (though I might reconsider that,
as he could be the basis for a separate all-NA marauder team that would
allow you to battle). These ratings are tentative until we find out what
the Nemesis icon is going to mean; it sounds as though it may be a
disadvantage, so for now I assigned it -5. When the Fajo rules are
released I'll reevaluate.

The Major's Combos:

- Lore + Sisters of Duras = Wormhole Negotiations

- Lore + Roga Danar + a few STAs = one frightening battle-specific Away
Team

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #34@{ub}


Aefvadh! With the release of the First Contact Rules Supplement
and two of the card images, everyone's attention, focused for
weeks on the Fajo Collection, has suddenly turned to First
Contact. And well it might, for even a cursory examination of
the rules supplement verifies the tag to its opening
paragraph...THIS CHANGES EVERTHING. Although it's impossible to
predict, before seeing the cards themselves, all the
implications of the sweeping rules changes, new card types, and
other new features that will come with this set, I have decided
to make this review the first in a series examining those
implications. This time out, I'll just give an overview of my...


    @{b}FIRST THOUGHTS ON FIRST CONTACT@{ub}

Breathtaking. Mind-boggling. Wow... Oh, you want me to get a
little more specific? OK, here goes.

Unlimited Deck Size

Who hasn't wanted this? If you want to use a Cryo or a lot of
doorways, and still have room for enough dilemmas to put a
damper on your opponent's mission-solving abilities, you've
probably been using every one of your 30 seed card slots
already, leaving a bare 30 for your draw deck. And let me tell
you, that's *cramped.* By the time you include a minimal crew to
cover your missions and dilemmas (13-14), a ship or two, 3-4 Q's
Tents, a couple of Kivases, a minimum of the omnipotent trio of
counters (you know you're going to need them!), and a few
Palors, there is just no room for something to enhance a theme,
an equipment card, an Interrogation, a Thine Own Self... all the
nifty cards that you look at time and again when deck-building
and say, "I think I'll put one of these in", and then find
there's no room once again.

No more! Now you can use those 30 seed slots, and still put
everything you want in your draw deck. Want to build a deck that
lets you have everything to solve your missions, but also add a
theme of "don't let your opponent reuse cards"? You now have
room for a few Fire Sculptors, Devidian Foragers, and
Countermandas, without sacrificing your missions. Want to build
a capture deck? In addition to a few Cardie Traps among your
dilemmas, throw in Madred (maybe in your Tent) and some Thine
Own Selfs, Interrogations, and Brainwashes. Tired of losing your
Empaths to Yuta, just before a Thought Fire or Cardie Trap? You
have space for a bunch of Wolf interrupts!

Just watch out that you don't try to do *everything* in one
deck. Before you know it, your draw deck will be so huge that
you won't be able to draw the cards you need when you need them.
If you need 3 or 4 Q's Tents in a 30-card draw deck now to make
sure you get one early, you'll probably need 6 or 7 in a 60-card
draw deck. The new "downloading" promises to make obtaining some
cards on demand easier, but at what cost? We don't know yet, and
it certainly won't apply to everything.

No Duplication of Unique Missions

If this rule had been in effect for the World Championships, one
very interesting match I played against Chris "Morgan Bateson"
Swearingen would have been very different, though no less
interesting. Our mission decks were identical--all 6. We would
have ended up with only 6 unique missions between us to actually
attempt, plus between 6-12 non-attemptable universal missions.
This rule will strongly encourage use of the more obscure
missions, which will translate to lower point, mostly single
affiliation, missions. No longer will you have two Pegasus
Searches, two Hunt for DNA Programs, or two Wormhole
Negotiations to choose from; you'll have only one. Who will get
to it first? If it's the whole basis of your strategy, you may
be in trouble.

Seeding and Reuse of Artifacts

Finally, the long-time tournament rule restricting artifacts to
one per player per mission has been made the standard for all
play. This is good. Solving an easy outpost planet mission for 3
artifacts is definitely abusive; what chance do I have after you
acquire a Horga'hn, Betazoid Gift Box, and a Kurlan Naiskos? Not
much. Artifacts are supposed to be "rare objects", according to
the original rulebook, with "immense powers". Doesn't sound like
something you'd expect to find three of on one planet, does it?
Note especially that if you illegally seed more than one at a
location, *all* of them are considered misseeds and must be
placed out-of-play. You don't get to keep even one.

Another new ruling states that a discarded or nullified artifact
cannot be brought back into play unless it is reseeded (Q's
Planet) and re-earned. This presumably will replace the current
tournament ruling that "discarded after use" artifacts such as
the Gift Box are placed out-of-play. The reason for that ruling
was largely to prevent endless reuse of the Gift Box through
repeated Palor-ing. But it didn't go far enough, because it
allowed a nullified artifact, such as the powerful Horga'hn or
Ressikan Flute, to be Palor-ed and immediately replayed. The new
ruling neatly takes care of both problems at once, essentially
allowing you to retrieve *one* artifact *once*, if you have Q's
Planet and can solve it before your opponent does. A good curb
on the unbalancing power of artifacts.

Unused Seed Cards

Seed cards unused at the end of the seed phase have always been
intended to go out-of-play (not to the discard pile), to prevent
retrieval of unearned artifacts or a pool of nasty dilemmas to
place under Q's Planet. Unfortunately, that was never written
down anywhere official, and had to be extrapolated from the rule
that misseeds go out-of-play. Now it's official.

Seeding Outposts

Well, I guess I have to revise my review on outposts. Just when
we got it all settled how many you *can* seed and *must* stock,
they've changed the rules on us. :-) But it's a heck of a lot
simpler now. Anyone can seed one Neutral Outpost, in addition to
one affiliated outpost for each affiliation you're playing. Or
you can seed (or include in your deck) fewer, or none at all.
Whatever suits you. Simple and fair.

Winning the Game

No more premature deck draw-out wins! If you've ever been
blind-sided by an opponent grabbing a quick mission and then
drawing out his deck before you could score more than a few
points, you'll appreciate this one. There is no longer any
advantage to a quick draw-out, because the game won't end till
your opponent also draws out. With unlimited deck size, that
could be a while. Meanwhile, you'll have to play with the cards
you have. Of course, the unlimited (and variable) deck size made
this necessary.

Downloading

Sounds intriguing. I'll reserve further comment until we see
just what can be downloaded, and how that can be triggered.

Battle Enhancements

Well, folks, anyone who knows the Major at all knows that she's
pretty lukewarm on battle. Other than noting that the new
personnel battles sound a lot more interesting (if you like
battle) and a lot more dangerous (you can lose considerably more
than one personnel), and that it's nice to see the rules for
attacking, leaders, and retaliation clarified and simplified,
I'm really not the one to review battle rules. Maybe if they
provide more capturing mechanisms tied to battle (in the battle
expansion), it'll pique my interest.

New Bridge Crew and Persona Replacement

Considering how often the Major plays Feds (what, never?...well,
hardly ever), this is another "ho-hum" for me. Persona
replacement is likely to be fairly useless for the Romulans,
too, unless they come up with a few green personas, which seems
fairly unlikely--there aren't enough Rommies as it is, and most
were seen only once; where will they get personas from?

Regions of Space

Again, the implications are unclear. I'll pass until we see how
the concept is used.

Hidden Agendas

This sounds like something with definite possibilities for the
Romulans. Who better to have a hidden agenda? But we still don't
know what they might be.

Countdown Icons

I think I'll hire a bookkeeper to keep track of when to move the
Borg Ship dilemma and The Sheliak, when to flip Aldea, what the
RANGE is now on my Birth of Junior-ed ship, how far along the
Anti-Time Anomalies and Temporal Rifts are, what K'chiQ's skill
is this turn, how close my ships are to being repaired, and now,
when the countdown icons should be turned...

Objective Cards and Probing

This is apparently the main method the Borg have for scoring
points. But we are promised some that are usable by other
affiliations. Again, I'll have to reserve judgment until we see
them. The probing mechanism introduces some randomness into
certain card effects, and if the real objectives are anything
like the hypothetical example, you may be encouraged to include
certain card types in your deck just for the icons.

Timeline Disruption

This appears to be a major Feddie hoser. However, Romulans and
Klingons can get hurt, too, because we rely so much on
non-aligned personnel, several of whom are human (Galen could
really hurt), and Sela, one of the better Romulans, is half
human. Fortunately, Major Rakal is protected by her AU icon.

Captain's Log

This card now relies on "matching commanders", which can be from
personnel lore OR ship's lore. At this point, this has no effect
on the Romulans, as their capital ships are all CL-eligible
under the old rule anyway. But it will enable a few new combos
for the Klingons, and will make the Fed fans *very* happy--not
to mention Q, who will no longer have to answer the question,
"Why doesn't Jean-Luc Picard get CL for the Enterprise?".

The Borg

Clearly this topic deserves an article or two or three all to
itself. At this point, I'll just say that it appears that
Decipher has done a bang-up job of working out how this new
affiliation is going to work. Their single-mindedness has become
a requirement for an "objective" (only one at a time allowed);
they don't do missions, just as we would expect, but they still
have to face dilemmas via "scouting" (this is crucial; if all
your dilemmas were useless when confronted with a Borg opponent,
it would be a gamebreaker), and while some dilemmas will
apparently be ignored by the Borg (Matriarchal Society, Love
Interests), it would appear that others may be pretty nasty to
an affiliation required to start scouting with a redshirt (Alien
Parasites). There are apparently quite a number of drones with
different skills, alleviating some concerns that the Borg might
be pretty boring, with only 3 or 4 generic drones. They have
some super-powerful ships (8-24-24 sounds pretty intimidating; I
think I'll stock up on Plasmadyne Relays, Nutational and
Metaphasic Shields, and Bynars, thank you) with the negatives of
a 7-personnel staffing requirement, a 45-point bounty, and the
necessity to have an objective in play that will allow them to
attack. I would have to say that it sounds like they have worked
very hard at making the Borg powerful, scary, but balanced.

The Major's Combos:

- First Contact + any affiliation. There's something here for
everyone, whether you want to play Borg or not. I think we're
going to find it was well worth the wait.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #35@{ub}


Due to the untimely deletion of posts from the 29th and 30th
(necessary because of the size of the board), I am reposting my
review on Borg Objectives. Just one note of correction: I stated
in my initial post that you didn't *have* to play the objective
(which has a Hidden Agenda icon in this case) face down. That
was incorrect; if a card has a Hidden Agenda icon, you *must*
play it (or seed it, if it is seedable) face down. However, you
may turn it face up at any time (after the seed phase), so in
this case you would play it face down and immediately turn it
over, if that was the effect you wanted. If you have a Hidden
Agenda that you seed during the seed phase, you must wait until
the seed phase is over before you may activate it. My apologies
for any confusion, and thanks to Bill Martinson for pointing out
this oversight to me.

Major Rakal's Romulan Review #35
11/29/97 (Initial Post)
12/02/97 (Revised)

Aefvadh! For the second in my series on First Contact, let's
take a look at the major new card type introduced in the
expansion, Objectives. Since most of the objectives are clearly
Borg-oriented (anything that starts "Assimilate..."), let's
specifically examine the workings of...


    @{b}BORG OBJECTIVES@{ub}

The Borg don't attempt missions. This is logical; it's difficult
to picture the Borg assisting in quelling a plague, or
conducting diplomatic negotiations. While other affiliations
earn points by solving missions, the Borg earn points by
completing objectives. A Borg objective represents a goal, such
as assimilating a planet or a ship, or establishing a transwarp
gateway at a space location.

The most crucial feature of Borg objectives to keep in mind is
that the Borg essentially cannot do anything without a
"motivating" objective. They normally cannot attack, or beam to
a planet or to an opponent's ship unless their current objective
permits them to do so. (There are exceptions, such as
counterattacking against a suicidal opponent who attacks first,
or if a specific card allows or requires it, such as an Iconian
Gateway, or the Conundrum dilemma.)

For other affiliations, solving a mission requires announcing
the mission attempt by a crew or Away Team, encountering and
resolving any dilemmas or Q-Flashes seeded there, followed by
completion of the mission and scoring its points by bringing the
necessary skills to the mission. The Borg follow an analogous
process: playing an objective card and naming its target,
scouting the location or ship by encountering and resolving
dilemmas and Q-flashes, and finally completing the objective
(and scoring points if applicable) by probing for an outcome.

Let's look at each part of this process, illustrating it with
the one Borg objective we have seen so far, which, judging by
hints and examples in the rules, is likely to be quite typical.
(Some objectives may not include all features of this one.)
Although the card text may look straightforward, parts of the
process are defined in the rules and may not be obvious from
reading the card alone. Also, the different parts of the process
are dispersed among various sections of the rules, under
"Objectives", "Probing", "Scouting", and more; here I will bring
them all together in one place.


    @{b}ASSIMILATE PLANET@{ub}

    Objective, 25 points
    [Borg Use Only], [Hidden Agenda]

Plays on table. Target an unassimilated planet on spaceline
(except a homeworld) with a point box showing at least 35
points. Your Borg may scout that planet. If you have Borg at
that spaceline location, you may probe:
[Com], [Def]: Assimilated. Place on planet. May download one
Objective card.


Establishing Your Objective

The first step is to play the objective card on the table. This
counts as your normal card play, and it must be played before
you execute orders, like an Event card. Because this objective
has a Hidden Agenda icon, you must play it face down on the
table; it will be inactive until you turn it face up, at which
time it becomes your "current objective." As a Borg player, you
may have only one current objective at a time, representing the
single-mindedness of the Borg collective.

When you play the card face up (or turn it up), if it requires
you to target something, you must do so immediately, announcing
your selected target to your opponent. In this case, you must
target a planet on the spaceline (i.e., not a time location,
which is not part of the spaceline) that has not already been
assimilated. Furthermore, it may not be a homeworld (defined in
the rules; so far these include Earth, Romulus, and Qo'noS), and
it must have a point box with at least 35 points. The mission
may belong to you or to your opponent, and it may be solved or
unsolved when you target it.

Once you have established your objective, you cannot simply
discard it to play a different one, unless another card allows
you to do this. It remains your objective until you complete it,
until it is nullified, or until the target is removed from play
or somehow becomes invalid (in which case you discard the
objective). For example, if the planet you targeted with
Assimilate Planet was pulled into a Black Hole or assimilated by
a Borg opponent before you completed the objective, you would
discard the objective.

Scouting the Target

Once you have announced your target, you may continue to the
next step specified on the objective card. In the case of
Assimilate Planet, the objective gives you permission to "scout"
the target planet. Scouting represents "overcoming resistance
and gathering data", and as with attempting missions, involves
overcoming dilemmas and Q-Flashes. (For the rest of this review,
when I refer to dilemmas, I am including Q-Flashes.) Scouting
follows a rigid protocol, defined in the rules, depending on
whether you are scouting a planet, a space location, or an enemy
ship.

Unlike other affiliations, the Borg are required to "red shirt"
dilemmas on a planet. You must beam down one lone "scout", as
the Borg sent a single scout to the Enterprise in the episode Q
Who. Now you may begin turning up dilemmas, just as you do for a
normal mission attempt. If the scout is killed, stopped, or
otherwise unable to continue, you may beam down another single
scout to continue.

There are a few things to keep in mind as your scouts encounter
dilemmas. First, they are *not* "attempting the mission." If a
dilemma refers to a mission attempt, that part of the dilemma is
probably not applicable to the Borg. For example, Alien
Abduction is "cured" by completing the mission OR 3 Leadership.
Since the Borg will never complete the mission, they would need
3 Leadership to get the alien-abducted Borg back. Second,
"Gender is irrelevant." The Borg are unaffected by Love
Interests or Parallel Romance, for example. Third, "Bonus points
are irrelevant" (to the Borg, that is). If your Borg overcome
Microvirus, they do not earn the 5 bonus points. Just discard
the dilemma. However, if they encounter something that would
give points to their non-Borg opponent (such as Lemon-Aid), the
opponent scores normally.

You may be wondering how the Borg can ever overcome a "wall"
dilemma such as Hologram Ruse (requires INTEGRITY >30 + CUNNING
>30), if they are required to send down one scout at a time to
encounter it. Every scout will be stopped! What you can do is
send down enough individual scouts to supply the required
conditions. Each of them will be stopped for the rest of this
turn, but on your next turn, now that you have them all there,
they can continue scouting together and overcome the dilemma. Of
course, like any other Away Team, they must then continue to the
next dilemma; they can't "abort" a scouting attempt when they
aren't stopped, any more than a regular Away Team can abort a
mission attempt. If they become stopped again, you may split
them up into separate Away Teams on your next turn.

Scouting a space location works the same way (encountering
dilemmas), except that the entire crew of a ship is involved in
scouting, just as in a mission attempt.

Enemy ships are scouted by beaming over a single scout to do
whatever is allowed by the objective card. If that scout is
stopped or killed, you may beam over another, and so on, as when
scouting a planet.

When there are no dilemmas left at the location (or when you
have Borg aboard an enemy ship at the end of your turn), you
have completed scouting. Important: If scouting is directed on
an objective, you *must* complete scouting before you can
continue with the objective's instructions. This will not be
part of the card text, but rather is part of the rules.
Assimilate Planet says, "Your Borg may scout that planet. If you
have Borg at that spaceline location, you may probe." This may
sound like it is only required to have Borg there in order to
probe, but you must complete scouting first. Keep in mind the
similarity to mission attempts. A mission may require Geology to
solve the mission, but just bringing Geology to the mission
doesn't solve it and score points if you haven't yet encountered
and resolved all the dilemmas. Resolving any dilemmas present is
an inherent part of the mission-solving process, even though it
doesn't say this on the mission card. Likewise, it is an
inherent part of the objective-completion process (if the
objective mentions scouting).

Probing for the Objective's Outcome

Once you have completed scouting, you are ready to probe for an
outcome to your objective, starting on your next turn. You may
not probe for that objective on the same turn you completed
scouting, or on the same turn that you participated in any
battles at that location (including your opponent's previous
turn). The objective may also have other conditions you must
fulfill before probing; Assimilate Planet requires you to have
Borg "at that spaceline location." In other words, your Borg may
beam back to their ship, but at least one Borg must remain on a
ship or on the planet at that location--you can't just take them
all elsewhere in anticipation of your next objective.

At the end of your turn (the next turn after completing
scouting, that is), just before your card draw, turn over and
look at the top card of your draw deck. This is your "probe
card." Look on the probe card for an icon that matches one of
the icons in the objective's probe list. Assimilate Planet has
only one outcome listed, which requires either a blue Borg
Communication subcommand icon or a red Borg Defense subcommand
icon to appear on the probe card.

If one of the required icons appears on the probe card (on a
Borg Cube, for example, or a Borg drone), replace the probe card
on your draw deck, and do what the objective says: First, place
the objective card on the planet, which is now assimilated. You
score the 25 points for the objective. Then, if you wish, you
may download one Objective card and put it in play. Once you
placed the objective on the assimilated planet, it is no longer
your current objective; this outcome allows you to get your next
objective into play immediately. (Of course, you might already
have a Hidden Agenda objective face down on the table, in which
case you may not wish to download another one.)

However, if the probe card is Amanda Rogers, for example, the
probe is unsuccessful, because the subcommand icons do not
appear on Amanda Rogers. Replace the probe card on your draw
deck. You may probe again on your next turn. Note that you will
normally draw the probe card as your card draw immediately after
you are done probing (unless you download from your draw deck as
part of the outcome, in which case you must shuffle the deck).

Some objectives may have more than one possible outcome. For
example, an Event or Interrupt icon may trigger outcome #1,
while an Alternate Universe icon might trigger outcome #2. If
the probe card in such a case was an Alternate Universe
Interrupt card (e.g., Brain Drain), then you would execute the
outcome whose icon appears first in the probe list, in this
case, outcome #1.

Note in the rules the consequences of a successful assimilation
for Assimilate Planet. The mission may no longer be attempted or
scored by your opponent (though if he already scored it, he
keeps the points). Seeded artifacts are placed on the planet to
be acquired later by a Survey Drone or by non-Borg personnel;
and any opposing personnel, equipment, and landed ships (not
those in orbit) on the planet, as well as opposing stations and
outposts, are assimilated also.

In summary, the Borg complete objectives by:
1. Playing an objective card and selecting its target
2. Scouting the target planet, space location, or ship (if so
directed on the objective) to resolve all dilemmas and Q-Flashes
present
3. Probing for one of the listed outcomes on the objective card
and carrying out the instructions for that outcome

Next time, I'll look a little more closely at the objective
Assimilate Planet itself, and talk about strategies in using it.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #36@{ub}


Aefvadh! As I promised last time, here is a more in-depth look
at the first Borg objective that has been revealed. "Where's the
Romulan viewpoint?," you may ask. After all, this is a Borg Use
Only objective. Well, for one thing, even the most dedicated
Romulan may decide to take a Delta Quadrant holiday and check
out the new affiliation. For another, by examining how the Borg
may use this objective, we can find ways for your Romulans (and
all of the other affiliations) to fight back, when the Borg try
to...


    @{b}ASSIMILATE PLANET@{ub}

    Objective, common, 25 points
    [Borg Use Only], [Hidden Agenda]

Plays on table. Target an unassimilated planet on spaceline
(except a homeworld) with a point box showing at least 35
points. Your Borg may scout that planet. If you have Borg at
that spaceline location, you may probe:
[Com], [Def]: Assimilated. Place on planet. May download one
Objective card.


The first thing to keep in mind about the Borg is that your old
strategy of playing Romulan-only missions, to cut down the
possibility of mission-stealing, is useless against the Borg, to
whom affiliation icons are quite irrelevant. They're never going
to attempt your missions or their own, so they don't give a hoot
what icons are on your missions.

On the other hand, they're *very* interested in the point value
of those planet missions, because anything less than 35 points
is (conceptually) too low-level technologically for them to want
to assimilate. So while previously you may have tried to fill
your spaceline with 35- and 40-pont missions (or higher) in
hopes of a two-mission win (with some bonus points here and
there), now that the Borg have found the Alpha Quadrant you may
well want to reconsider the attractiveness of those 30- and
(gasp!) 25-pointers, formerly disdained as mere chicken feed.
Covert Rescue, Plunder Site, Strategic Diversion, Excavation,
and even Relief Mission, plus others, will all be safe from
assimilation. If your Borg opponent has based his strategy on
assimilating planets, you will have forced him to rely only on
assimilating his own.

This has several advantages. First, you severely limit the
choices he has for planets to assimilate; he may have to go a
lot further to reach enough of them to score 100 points. His
missions will be harder to scout, because he won't know what
dilemmas you have seeded, while at yours he knows exactly what
dilemmas he has placed (maybe Edo Probes or Love Interests that
will have no effect on him). And because you can't attempt and
solve a planet mission once it has been assimilated, you want to
prevent him from "stealing" your missions by assimilation,
leaving you nothing to solve. Sure, it's going to be a slower
victory for you to do three 30-point missions with some bonus
points on the side, but it's better than having your New Contact
and Hunt for DNAProgram scooped up by the Borg, who couldn't
care less about the difficulty of the mission requirements.

Now that you have cornered the Borg into scouting their own
missions, how about dilemmas? There are all kinds of nasty
planet dilemmas out there. We're not going to know just how easy
or difficult it will be for the Borg to pass various dilemmas
until we see what skills the drones and the Borg Queen have, and
how other cards in the set may enhance the Borg abilities, but
there are a few things we do know already. Gender-related
dilemmas will be ignored by the Borg, so Love Interests,
Matriarchal Society, Parallel Romance, and Anaphasic Organism
won't do much for you. The same goes for android-hosers.
Points-related dilemmas are irrelevant also, so heavy reliance
on point-suckers like The Higher...The Fewer, Punishment Zone,
and Edo Probe will get you nowhere. And the Borg are forced to
red-shirt, so one-shot killers, especially ones with no
conditions like Armus or Hunter Gangs, should easily pick off a
scout or two.

Finally, once the Borg player manages to finish scouting the
target planet, he still has to probe his draw deck until he
comes up with a card showing either a blue (Communication) or
red (Defense) subcommand icon. He can't probe on the turn that
he completed scouting, but has to wait till the end of his next
turn. Furthermore, he must keep at least one Borg at that
spaceline location through the turn that he probes. And most
important, perhaps, he can't probe if his Borg participate in
any battles at the target planet location during that turn, *or*
on his opponent's immediately prior turn. This gives you one way
to delay his assimilation of the planet: you can attack his Borg
at that location during your intervening turn. Risky? Very,
because he will then be free to counterattack any of your forces
still at that location on his turn. If he is using a Borg Cube
ship, this may be suicidal, but it may be worth considering if
you can attack with an expendable ship and crew while your main
crew works on a mission elsewhere.

If you are the Borg player, planning an Assimilate Planet
strategy, make sure you supply your own assimilation fodder in
the form of 35-point or higher planet missions, just in case
your opponent read this and brought in all 30's or less. You
don't particularly care what the affiliations or requirements
are for yourself, so you might as well make them exotic enough
that they won't be likely to tempt your opponent to try to solve
them himself.

If your opponent did use higher point planets, don't tip your
hand immediately by playing the objective and immediately
targeting one of his planets. A bad draw may delay you from
getting to the planet with enough drones to begin scouting, and
meanwhile he may either attempt and complete the mission and get
his points and artifact before you can assimilate it (though
this does save you the trouble of encountering your own
dilemmas, it is advantageous to you to prevent him from scoring
the mission in the first place), or he may simply avoid
confrontation with you by diverting to a different mission--and
once you have targeted a mission, you can't switch to a
different one. So if your objective card comes up early, simply
play it face down--it does have the Hidden Agenda icon--and let
your opponent wonder what your strategy will be.When you are
ready to start scouting, only then do you have to turn the card
up and name a target. (My statement in Review #35 that you are
not required to play the Hidden Agenda face down was incorrect.
You *must* play a Hidden Agenda face down. However, you may turn
it over and activate it immediately, or later.)

A few words about probing. Remember that the probe icon may
appear anywhere on the probe card, in any context. The most
obvious place you might expect to find the subcommand icons
would be on a Borg drone's card, and if you have lots of spare
drones in your deck, probably 2 out of 3 of them will have one
of the needed icons. All subcommand icons also also appear on
the Borg Cube, so a few cubes in your deck are also a useful
source. However, if you have to get out a lot of drones and
ships to work with, you may deplete your deck of these icon
sources. Fortunately, there is one card with the very icons you
need, which you will almost certainly have more of in your deck
if your strategy is to assimilate planets: the objective card
itself, Assimilate Planet.

The Major's Combos:

- My array of 30-point missions + your deck full of Assimilate
planet objectives.

@Node MRRR37 "STCCG.guide/Major Rakal's Romulan Review/Ready Room Door"
@TOC "STCCG:romreview.guide/MRRR"

        @{u}@{b}@{fg highlight}Major Rakal's Romulan Review@{fg text}@{ub}@{uu}

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #37@{ub}


Aefvadh! First Contact is just full of interesting new concepts. This
time, it's a doorway card that is literally just that, a doorway. The
captain has something to say, so open up the...


    @{b}READY ROOM DOOR@{ub}

    Doorway, uncommon

Once per turn, plays to download to one of your ships its matching
commander (draw no cards this turn) OR to download one Captain's Order
(Captain's Log, Lower Decks, Yellow Alert, Senior Staff Meeting or any
card so marked). After use, discard doorway; place it atop your draw
deck; or place it atop one of your Captain's Order events to protect
that event from nullification.


At last, we find out what that mysterious new term "Captain's Order"
means, seen so far on the Assign Mission Specialists objective and the
Mission Debriefing event. And a powerful concept it is. When the Captain
wants something done, he walks out of his ready room, gives the order
and, presto! It's carried out.

Too many times, I've tried to include Captain's Log in my decks,
especially since the appearance of Sirol, Taris, and the Terix in QC
provided the Romulans with *five* matching Captain's Log sets. But I
don't remember ever getting it to work. I could get the ship, but not
the captain, or vice versa. Or I couldn't turn up the Captain's Log
itself. Even Q's Tent wasn't much help, because I needed enough other
contingency cards there that I couldn't afford to load it with CL and a
couple of matching captain-ship sets (and CL isn't so attractive with
only one ship to benefit). And then there was the dismal prospect of a
Kevin zapping my hard-won Captain's Log before I could benefit from it.

Now...no problem. Put a couple of ships in your Tent where you can pull
them early, and a couple more in your deck, plus all the matching
commanders and a load of Ready Room Doors. Tent your ships, download the
commanders, then download Captain's Log *and* protect it from
nullification. Quick armada.

Or how about Lower Decks? Romulan decks tend to use quite a few
universals, just because they have only one each unique MEDICAL and
SECURITY, as well as the fact that you can base an Archaeology-Treachery
deck around Taul and Galathon. These guys badly need the INTEGRITY +2,
if nothing else. Now you can be pretty sure of getting Lower Decks in
place and protected early enough to do some good. (BTW, the Klingons
will be well served by this ploy to boost their dim-witted commons'
CUNNING to reasonable levels, and the Feds will benefit most from the
STRENGTH. Something for everyone here.)

Now, of course, a lot of universals have only one skill, making them
semi-useless...wait a minute, making them *Mission Specialists*! So not
only can you boost their stats with a downloaded Lower Decks, you can
download the Assign Mission Specialists objective, which in turn lets
you download the mission specialists themselves. It won't work for Taul
and Galathon, but Palteth, Selok, and Takket are all fair game. Choose
your missions to fit their single skills, and reap 5-point bonuses every
time they help solve a mission with those skills.

One problem shared by many Romulan personnel, including most of the
universals, is odd CUNNING. Hunter Gangs has a better than average
chance of decimating a Romulan Away Team. So download a Yellow Alert, to
increase their CUNNING by 1 to an even number. It will prevent your
opponent from using Red Alert, and while it does the same to you, with
all those downloadable personnel you probably won't miss it.

Doing a space deck? Download a Senior Staff Meeting for each mission, to
get rid of the first dilemma. This one's not an event so it can't be
protected by the doorway, so you'll want to have Q2 handy.

Beware of Revolving Doors! While they don't affect the playing of the
doorway from your hand (Wrong Doors are the hazard there), if you're
protecting a Captain's Order event with a Ready Room Door, that door can
be "closed" by a Revolving Door like any other doorway. When it's closed
its game text is inactive, so the underlying event can be Kevined,
discarding both the event and the Ready Room Door. Door-Net can do the
same thing, but you choose where to put a Door-Net. It will probably be
easier to get along with a closed AU Door or Q's Tent for a while than
to leave your precious Captain's Order vulnerable.

Now, I'm just waiting to see what other Captain's Orders will surface.

The Major's Combos:

- Ready Room Door x3 + Captain's Log + Taris + Haakona + Sirol + Terix.
  What Romulan deck *doesn't* include Taris and Sirol anyway?

- Ready Room Door + Assign Mission Specialists + Parem + Selok. Kick-
  start your Treachery deck.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #38@{ub}
        12/14/97

Aefvadh! First Contact doesn't include many missions, no doubt
because of the narrow focus of the movie. But the two that have
been shown, both universals, take on a particular importance
with the new rule on replacement of duplicated unique missions
with universal ones. The previous universal missions have been
non-attemptable and pointless (as opposed to useless); if we
were restricted to those for our substitutes, it would be
possible to have a spaceline containing only 6 attemptable
missions, narrowing your options considerably. But now we have
two universal missions that can be solved for points, and by far
the one with the greatest potential is...


    @{b}PATROL NEUTRAL ZONE@{ub}

    Uncommon Space Mission, universal
    Fed/Rom, 10X points, Span 5
    Leadership + No opposing ships in Neutral Zone
    X= number of Neutral Zone locations in play

@{i}"Nebula at Neutral Zone: Prevent incursions along border of
Federation/Romulan Neutral Zone."@{ui}

This initially unassuming mission can provide a real bonanza,
particularly for a Romulan player. Because it's universal, you
can seed more than one, and the more you seed, the more each one
is worth. The only skill required is Leadership, and the
Romulans have plenty of that.

This strategy is most useful to the Romulans, because they have
the advantage of already having three unique, Romulan-only
missions located "in the Neutral Zone," two of them planets.
They can build an all-Neutral Zone section of the spaceline
without running afoul of Balancing Act, with four missions worth
60 points each, and still have a couple of standard "backup"
missions in case they can't get rid of an opposing ship. Because
the new "Regions of Space" rule specifies that all missions
located "in the Neutral Zone" must be seeded adjacent to each
other, a compact, easy to reach mission-solving zone is all but
guaranteed (your opponent's *Space could intervene).

The Federation, in contrast, has no other Neutral Zone missions,
and must either rely on six Patrol Neutral Zones (risky, because
of both inherent Federation difficulties in eliminating
opposition, and the danger of heavy penalties from Balancing
Act), or else play two unrelated planet missions, making the
PNZs worth only 40 points each, and with the planet missions
possibly located far away from the Neutral Zone.

The catch, of course, is the requirement that you must have no
opposing ships in the Neutral Zone in order to complete the
mission. Your opponent only has to park a ship--even a cloaked
one--at any one of the Neutral Zone locations to prevent you
from completing any Patrol Neutral Zones. You have a several
options to force it to leave or eliminate it.

Because PNZ is a "Nebula at Neutral Zone", you could play
Isabella on the ship to destroy it, if the parking space is one
of the PNZs and there is no Youth aboard (or at least make it
leave to pick up a Youth, long enough for you to complete the
mission). An Incoming Message for the appropriate affiliation
should also suffice to get the opponent out of your hair long
enough to complete a mission. Wormhole it away as it starts to
move toward the Neutral Zone, toward the wrong end of the
spaceline. A Temporal Rift will probably make it disappear long
enough for you to complete *two* PNZs and win. If your opponent
is incautious enough to leave the ship empty, play a Ship
Seizure and haul it away. A Warp Core Breach will also come in
handy if he didn't want to tie up an ENGINEER on patrol duty,
though it will cost you a card play. And how about mining the
space locations with Anti-Matter Pods? Just keep plenty of
Navigation aboard your own ships.

Then there is the straightforward approach of attacking and
destroying the offending ship. Be prepared with La Forge
Maneuver or Tachyon Detection Grid to force decloaking so you
can attack. Although Tachyon Detection Grid requires you have
four ships in play, unlike La Forge Maneuver (which can only
expose a cloaked ship if the next action is an attack on the
ship) it can also be used to enable playing Isabella or Incoming
Message, which cannot be played on a cloaked ship. And you may
find it very useful to have all those ships in play, because you
can send three of them to destroy the intruder while the fourth
remains at the dilemma-cleared mission with a Leadership
personnel, unstopped and waiting to score those 60 points.

Federation options are much more limited, as they cannot
normally attack. A Husnock or two and a totally non-aligned crew
will get around that restriction, as will Incoming Message:
Attack Authorization coupled with Treachery aboard. The
non-attack methods will of course work also.

The universal nature of Patrol Neutral Zone also makes it very
useful substitute for a duplicate unique mission. If you're
playing Romulan or Federation, it will be worth at least 10
points more than *Space or *Nebula; and even if you're playing
Klingon, its point box can at least save you from tripping a
Balancing Act penalty if one of your two unique space missions
is the duplicate.

The Major's Combos:

- Patrol Neutral Zone x4 + Covert Installation + Iconia
  Investigation: four missions worth 60 points each.

- Patrol Neutral Zone + Assign Mission Specialists + Tallus:
  make that 65 points each.

- Patrol Neutral Zone + Sisters of Duras + non-aligned support
  crew: even the Klingons can get in on this strategy.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #39@{ub}


Aefvadh! Although I am a well-known fan of wall dilemmas like
Ancient Computer and Shaka, followed by personnel eliminators
like Cardassian Trap, once in a while something a little
different will strike my fancy. And it has been struck, by what
may well be the most "different" dilemma yet...


    @{b}OOBY DOOBY@{ub}

    Dilemma, Planet or Space, Rare

@{i}"Well, you wiggle to the left, you wiggle to the right; you do
the Ooby Dooby with all your might; Ooby Dooby; Ooby Dooby; Ooby
Dooby Ooby Dooby, Dooby Dooby doo wah, doo wah, doo wah."@{ui}


Draw one card for each non-android Youth present, then discard
one card for each Music present. All Youth, Music and Zefram
Cochrane present are "stopped."

Another example of the "filter" dilemma described in the card
extra for Blended, Ooby Dooby has no conditions, so it stops
only Youth, Music, and Zefram Cochrane (who certainly must have
neither). What kind of decks will this be good against?

Flute decks: They'll have lots of Music (Data, Juliana Tainer,
Picard, Riker, and multiple McKnights or Obarakehs), so will
have to discard lots of cards if they use those personnel to
attempt their missions. Of course, if they use McKnights,
they'll get to draw some too.

Android decks: They won't get to draw cards for the android
Youth (though they may not have to discard many either), and all
will be stopped because every android except Lore has either
Youth or Music.

Borg decks: Yes, that's right, Borg decks. The ones that use
Locutus of Borg and an Interlink Drone to share skills. Because
the sharing is not optional--if you have the Interlink Drone in
the hive and [Com] drones with any Away Team or on all ships,
they all automatically possess all the regular skills in the
hive--having Locutus around to provide diplomacy and an
automatically assimilated counterpart may prove a liability in
facing Ooby Dooby. The trick is to seed it after a wall dilemma
that can be overcome by skill sharing and enough drones. If the
Borg player gets past the wall dilemma this way instead of using
an Adapt: Negate Obstruction, all the Borg he sent down will
have Locutus's shared Music skill, causing the player to discard
that many cards and stopping them all again.

But this is also a dilemma you can profitably seed under your
own mission. Think of it as a Sarjenka that gives you card draws
instead of points. Seed this last, encounter it with an Away
Team or crew consisting entirely of non-android, non-Musical
Youth (an easy task for Romulans, with Sela, D'Tan, Varel,
Jaron, and others; just keep Taris out of this one), and get free
card draws without expending a card play on Kivas Fajo-Collector
(and it's not nullifiable). Without Music, you won't have to
discard anything, and with everyone stopped, you needn't worry
about continuing the mission attempt with an otherwise
unsuitable Away Team. Just don't play a Q's Tent first on the
turn you try this, or you won't be able to draw your cards.

For once, you can be happy that the Romulans are so deficient in
Music!

The Major's Combos:

- Ooby Dooby + Investigate Legend: As long as you need all that
  Youth in your deck, why not get some free card draws from them?

- Ooby Dooby + Wind Dancer: Stop the Youth and Music, then (with
  few exceptions) stop everyone else.

- Ooby Dooby + Security Precautions: You thought your androids
  would get you past this easily. Guess again.

- Ooby Dooby + Crystalline Entity (in space) + Lore: Only the
  Borg might survive this one.

- Shaka + Ooby Dooby + opponent's Locutus: 5-6 discards.

And for Federation players only (who said the Romulan Reviews
were of no interest to you Feds?):

- Ooby Dooby + Assign Mission Specialists x2 + Calloway, Giusti,
  Linda Larson, and Simon Tarses: Download your Youth, then draw 4
  extra cards.

- Ooby Dooby + McKnight x6: Exchange a bad hand for something
  new.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #40@{ub}


Aefvadh! I know a lot of people have been waiting for me to update my
dilemma facts list for the new dilemmas in First Contact (and one from
Fajo). Although I haven't gotten the two lists integrated yet--and that
may take a while--I have produced a separate listing of the dilemmas for
my website, in the same format as the previous table. A few explanations
are in order, so here is what you need to know about...


    @{b}FIRST CONTACT DILEMMAS@{ub}

There are a few new twists in some of the new dilemmas.

A number of them are so-called "filter" dilemmas, which filter out and
stop (or kill) certain classes of personnel, while forcing others to
continue. While not totally new (Chinese Finger Puzzle and Parallel
Romance are examples of filters), there are many more in FC than we have
seen before. Blended, Don't Call Me Ahab, Shot In The Back, and Strict
Dress Code are all filters. In general, filters will *not* say "discard
dilemma", because under the general dilemma rules, they don't need to;
if there are no conditions, the dilemma will always be discarded (as
long as it doesn't enter play). And because there are no conditions, the
rest of the Away Team (other than the specified targets) is not stopped
and must continue. (Blended is actually a combination of a wall dilemma
and a filter; you *must* bring certain personnel to the mission to get
past it, and then those targets are stopped while the others must
continue.)

Two dilemmas, Scout Encounter and Undetected Beam-In, have no direct
effect on the Away Team or crew, but instead allow the opponent to
download a scout ship and crew, or Borg drones or Rogue Borg. Undetected
Beam-In provides an exception to the rule that dilemmas only affect the
ship and crew, or Away Team, that encounters the dilemma, because the
download is "to this location," which may include other ships (of either
player), an outpost, or the planet (if any). Again, with no conditions,
these dilemmas do not stop and are automatically discarded after use.

Balancing Act is designed to promote balance between planet and space
missions, and thus has no effect whatsoever on the atempting Away Team
or crew. If you choose to play with mostly planet or mostly space
missions, you risk losing 50 points each time one of these dilemmas is
triggered by either player. A 4-2 split is safe (barring Supernovas or
Black Holes), but 5-1 and 6-0 are not. The penalty affects Borg players
as well as non-Borg.

Dead End is a wall dilemma with three twists. First, the "conditions" to
pass it are not skills or personnel; the only condition is that you
already have at least 50 points. If you do, you discard it and proceed.
The second twist comes into play if you don't have 50 points: not only
are you stopped, but the dilemma is placed on top of the mission and
stays there indefinitely, preventing anyone with less than 50 points
from attempting the mission (though Borg may scout). The third twist is
its "unique" designation. Fortunately, its uniqueness prevents you from
reaching a Dead End at *all* your missions; any subsequent ones
encountered that were seeded by the same player are discarded.

My First Raygun even relies on a probe to determine its outcome. If your
deck is full of Events, Interrupts, Alternate Universe icon cards, or
Enterprise-E personnel, you run a high risk of getting a personnel
killed. The lesser penalty, if no probe icons are encountered, is that
one personnel is stopped.

The other burning question about dilemmas is how they affect the Borg.
I'm still investigating this question, and will publish my results when
they are ready, but for now remember that most dilemmas affect the Borg
just as they affect anyone else. A few exceptions:

 Gender-related text has no effect (e.g., Love Interests). Such
  dilemmas would be discarded.

 If the dilemma refers specifically to a mission attempt, that text has
  no meaning to the Borg, because they don't attempt missions. Edo Probe,
  for example, would be discarded.

 Bonus points have no meaning to the Borg, but play the dilemma out
  normally otherwise. If they meet the conditions for Barclay's
  Protomorphosis Disease, the dilemma is discarded; they do not earn the
  points. Royale Casino sidegames might win or lose points for the
  opponent, but not for the Borg. The Higher...The Fewer would simply be
  discarded.

 The Borg Queen is neither unique nor universal, so she cannot be
  trapped in a Cardassian Trap or Rascal-ized.

 The Borg may pass dilemmas they have encountered on a previous turn
  with Adapt: Negate Obstruction.

For the listing of First Contact dilemmas, go to my website (URL listed
below). I will also mail it as two text files to the discussion mailing
list.

Major Rakal's Romulan Review #41
12/28/97

Aefvadh! For the next installment of my continuing series on First
Contact, I'm going to look at, not a single card or card type, but
rather a new concept that affects many card types. It comes in several
"flavors", each with its own peculiarities, and it can be confusing.
Let's examine...


    @{b}THE UPS AND DOWNS OF DOWNLOADING@{ub}

On the face of it, downloading is a simple concept. Just as you can
download information from the Internet to your computer, you can now
"download" a card from your deck to your hand, or directly into play, at
the time you need it. Downloads are allowed by some cards, required by
others. The confusing part is that there are two distinct types of
downloading, one specified in a text instruction to "download", the
other represented by a Special Download icon.  Though they have many
features in common, there are important differences. We'll look first at
the general rules, followed by the Special Download features.

Downloading

Downloading as a general concept is described in the First Contact Rules
Supplement under "New Rules." The ability or requirement to download
will be spelled out in detail on a card, using the word "download" (not
an icon). The "target" card(s) may be specific (Weak Spot) or more
general (a Borg drone).

When you are allowed or required to download a "target" card, you may
find it in any of four places: your draw deck, your hand, your Q's Tent
(if not closed or inactive), or your Zalkonian Storage Capsule. If the
download is for more than one card, they may come from different places.
You must show the target card to your opponent. Then, you may put it
directly into play, if that is possible. If not possible, or if you
choose not to play the card, you may put it into your hand.

Why might it not be possible to play the card immediately? For one
thing, you must obey normal reporting requirements for personnel,
equipment, and ships; that includes reporting them to an outpost
compatible with their affiliation (or other legal reporting location,
such as a Borg Cube), and having an open Alternate Universe Door for AU
icon cards. Wall of Ships, for example, "Downloads any Enterprise." If
you download the U.S.S. Enterprise-C (which has an AU icon), but your
Alternate Universe Door is closed by a Revolving Door, you cannot play
the ship. Visit Cochrane Memorial has one probe outcome that says
"Download a card." If you chose to download a personnel card, but your
only outpost had been destroyed, you could not play the personnel and
would have to place it in your hand. The exception to the outpost
requirement is a download that species another destination. Ready Room
Door instructs you to "download to one of your ships its matching
commander." An outpost is not required.

You also might not play the downloaded card immediately because you lack
an appropriate reason for doing so. Sense The Borg allows you, under
certain circumstances (various Borg cards entering play), to "Download
Weak Spot OR Hugh OR Borg Neuroprocessor OR Ready Room Door." Since Weak
Spot, for example, is used during a battle, you may not need it right
now, but because a Borg ship just entered play, you want to download it
in anticipation of need.

Downloading does not count as your normal card play. It is generally
tied either to the play of another card, or to the use of a skill on a
personnel card, either of which will determine the timing of the
download.
- Activate Subcommands reads "Downloads one [Com] Borg drone, one [Nav]
  Borg drone and one [Def] Borg drone." Because it is an event card,
  Activate Subcommands counts as your normal card play and must take place
  at the beginning of your turn, before executing orders. You perform the
  download immediately upon playing the event.
- Ready Room Door reads "Once per turn, plays to download to one of your
  ships its matching commander (draw no cards this turn)." This doorway
  card may be played at any time (subject to timing rules) during your own
  turn. You perform the download when you play the doorway.
- The Borg Queen has as a skill "May download A Change of Plans or a
  Borg drone in place of one card draw." You perform the download at the
  time the card draw would normally take place; e.g., at the end of your
  turn if replacing your normal card draw; at the time you play Kivas Fajo -
  Collector if replacing one or more of the three draws provided by that
  card. You may not perform the download earlier in anticipation of a
  later card draw.

Downloading is not considered a "card draw". Playing a Q's Tent does not
generally affect your ability to perform a download later in the turn.
However, if the download is specified to be "in place of one card draw",
and you are not entitled to a card draw, you cannot perform a download
instead.

If a download requires you to download a particular card or group of
cards, and you cannot download some of them, the entire download is
invalid. For example, Activate Subcommands requires you to download one
drone from each of the three subcommands. If you look through your deck,
hand, Tent, and Storage Capsule and find that you have no [Def] Borg
left to download, you cannot download any of the drones. Your opponent
may look through your decks and hand to verify that the download was
invalid.

If you attempt a download that expends some "resource" (you play a card,
you use a special icon, you forfeit your card draw), and the download
proves invalid, the resource is still used. In the above example, the
Activate Subcommands card is still discarded, and you cannot play
another card this turn, even though your download failed. If you attempt
to download with the Borg Queen's skill in place of your end-of-turn
card draw, but find you have no drones in your deck or hand, and A
Change of Plans is in your closed Q's Tent, the download is invalid, but
you still do not get your normal card draw.

If you or your opponent looks through your draw deck during a download,
you must reshuffle it afterwards.

Downloading in general does *not* circumvent the normal timing rules,
i.e., it does not allow you to suspend play or otherwise interrupt other
game actions, unless the card says it does. Awaken is an interrupt that
"downloads one [Com] or [Nav] drone." You could not play it when facing
a dilemma, for example, because the timing rules don't allow
interrupting a dilemma.

Special Download Icon

Some cards (mostly personnel, but also ships and outposts) have a
special icon, a red, downward-pointing triangle, known as a "Special
Download" icon (hereafter abbreviated [SD]) and described in the Rules
Supplement under "New Icons". The icon will be followed by a specific
target card name. On a personnel card, this icon is treated as a
"special skill" (so it cannot be shared, selected by K'chiQ or Lal, or
gained through Mindmeld). While they generally follow the normal
downloading rules, the downloads allowed by this icon have special
privileges and restrictions which do not apply to other downloads.

The special privilege of a Special Download is that, by definition, it
allows you to suspend play while you download the target card and put it
into play. In some cases this is mere convenience (you can get an
equipment card into your crew without returning to the outpost). In
others, it represents an emergency measure (you can get an interrupt
card that was not in your hand and play it after a battle has been
declared). But this privilege comes with a price.

First, you may use each particular [SD] only once per game. Alyssa Ogawa
has the skill [SD] Medical Kit. Once you have used that skill, even if
Alyssa Ogawa gets killed and you play another one, you can't use the
second copy's Special Download this game.

Second, unlike a regular download (where you may put the downloaded card
in your hand and play it later), a Special Download target *must* be put
into play immediately, at the location of the card with the [SD] icon,
or to affect something at that location. If you cannot do that, you
cannot download the card.

Examples:
- Alyssa Ogawa: [SD] Medical Kit. You play the equipment card directly
  to her crew or Away Team. There should never be a barrier to playing
  this card immediately. You might use the [SD] as a non-emergency measure
  just to get the Medical Kit, or you might use it to suspend play when
  facing a dilemma requiring more MEDICAL than you have, giving your
  OFFICERs present MEDICAL skill.
- Geordi La Forge: [SD] Ocular Implants. This event card plays on a
  Borg, android, or Geordi. You could always play it on Geordi himself, or
  you could play it on an android in his crew or Away Team. You could not
  play it on an android at another location.
- William T. Riker: [SD] Anti-Matter Spread. This interrupt plays *only*
  at the start of a ship battle. Thus, you cannot use the [SD] just to
  have the card ready in case of a later battle; you would use it only to
  suspend a battle just declared, so you could download Anti-Matter Spread
  from your deck and play it to reduce the opposing ship's WEAPONS.

To summarize the differences, a regular download (text instruction):
- follows normal timing rules (cannot suspend play unless specified on
  the card)
- may be performed more than once per game
- may be put into play immediately or placed in your hand for later use

while a Special Download (red triangle icon):
- may suspend any game action
- may be used only once per game (even if more than copy of the card is
  used)
- must be put into play immediately at the location of the [SD] icon.

Major Rakal's Romulan Review #42
01/04/98

Aefvadh! A few reviews back, we looked at Assimilate Planet, a 25-point
Borg objective that can wreak havoc on your mission-solving plans if the
Borg get to your missions first. This time we'll look at the first part
of another Borg strategy, one that involves (usually) the combination of
two objectives, nets the Borg anywhere from 40 to 70 points, and can
effectively eliminate you from the game. Sounds nasty, doesn't it? Come
along and observe the Borg strategy of...


    @{b}ASSIMILATING HOMEWORLDS FOR FUN AND PROFIT: PART 1@{ub}

Before you can assimilate a homeworld, first you need a "counterpart." A
counterpart is a male of the affiliation whose homeworld you wish to
assimilate. You can't just assimilate him as a drone in the ordinary way
(with a Talon Drone); he must be assimilated according to the Assimilate
Counterpart objective.


    @{b}ASSIMILATE COUNTERPART@{ub}

    Objective, uncommon
    [Borg Use Only], [Hidden Agenda]

Plays on table. Target an opponent's unique male personnel. Your Borg
may beam to and battle target's crew or Away Team. One of your Borg who
engages target in combat may abduct target. If target is occupying an
Assimilation Table, you may probe:
[Com],[Nav],[Def]: Assimilated as a counterpart. Place on target. Worth
5 points per [skill dot] while objective on target.


Like most Borg objectives, this one is a Hidden Agenda, so you play it
face down and turn it up only when you wish to activate it. In this
case, there are two excellent reasons why you may not wish--or be able
to--turn it up immediately. First, when you activate it, you must
immediately target your opponent's unique male personnel; and if you
want to assimilate a homeworld, it must be an affiliated personnel
matching a homeworld on the spaceline. If he has no unique males in
play, you cannot activate this objective. Second, it is to your
advantage not to tip your hand to your opponent as to whom you want to
target--or even that you plan to abduct a counterpart--until you have
maneuvered to a position where you can engage him in battle. If you tell
him your intentions too early, he may endeavour to get that personnel
killed by a dilemma (if the target is killed at any time, your objective
must be discarded), or alternatively, to abandon him, making it easy for
you to abduct him but possibly thwarting your plans to inflict battle
damage on him.

Once you have targeted the prospective counterpart, your objective
allows you to beam any number of drones (you aren't scouting) to the
target's location (you must have a Transport Drone to let you beam
through his SHIELDS, if he is on a ship or outpost) and initiate battle
with his crew or Away Team. You will want a large enough Away Team
to guarantee that the counterpart will have to face one of your Borg in
personal combat; otherwise, you cannot abduct him and risk having him
killed at the end of the battle. The moment one of your Borg engages the
target in combat, he may abduct him, removing the target and the escort
from  the battle, and if possible, beaming back to the Borg ship, where
they will be stopped. Finish off the personnel battle, and everyone else
will be stopped.

After you have abducted the target, your Borg no longer have any
motivation for battling the opponent unless he counterattacks on his
turn. You will probably want to beam your Borg back to your ship on your
following turn.

Next you place the abducted target on an Assimilation Table, a Borg Only
equipment card that you could have aboard your ship, though you may
prefer to have it on your outpost in the Delta Quadrant. The relevant
game text says "Holds one personnel (occupant killed if table
destroyed)." Aboard your ship, it could be destroyed by an untimely
Disruptor Overload, killing the counterpart you just abducted. To make
it easy to get your Assimilation Table, have a Procurement Drone, who
may download Borg Only equipment cards. Once the target is on the
Assimilation Table, you can start to probe to complete the objective.
The probe requirements are liberal: any one of the subcommand icons,
anywhere on the probe card, means a successful probe.

When the probe is successful, place the objective card on the target to
indicate that he has been assimilated as a counterpart. The objective is
worth 5 points for each red skill dot icon on the counterpart, but only
while the objective is on the counterpart; if he is killed or you turn
him into a drone with He Will Make An Excellent Drone, you lose the
points. Your new counterpart has all three subcommand icons in place of
his previous staff icon, his STRENGTH increases by 3, and he retains his
normal INTEGRITY and CUNNING. He also keeps his gender, species, and
lore, but otherwise is transformed as a drone would be.

Sounds like a lot of trouble? If you have Locutus of Borg, he is already
an "assimilated counterpart" (according to his lore) and may be used to
assimilate the Federation homeworld, Earth. If your intention is to
disrupt the timeline, that may be the easiest way to acquire your
counterpart, eliminating one step from that lengthy procedure (which I
will look at in a later review). But Locutus does not give you points
like Assimilate Counterpart does; and if your opponent is not playing
Federation, and you want to cause him the maximum grief by assimilating
his homeworld, you'll have to assimilate one of his personnel for your
counterpart.

How do you select a counterpart target? Obviously, he must match the
affiliation of the homeworld you want to assimilate. If he has more than
one affiliation icon, you may use that counterpart to assimilate both
homeworlds. So far, that strategy is limited to Stefan DeSeve, with whom
you could assimilate both Earth and Romulus. The other considerations
are his skills (might as well get someone with skills useful to your
hive) and the number of skill dot icons he has (5 points each).

Suppose you are playing one of the traditional affiliations and meet a
Borg opponent who is bent on assimilating one of your personnel as a
counterpart. What are your defenses?
- Use female, universal, and non-aligned personnel.
- If you know his intentions, stay away from him and don't get the
  target caught in a stopped Away Team. Cloak your ship.
- Use the target as a red shirt and get him killed by a dilemma. With
  his named target dead, your opponent will be forced to discard his
  objective and play another. He can't just choose another target.
- When he beams aboard your ship, use Launch Portal to help the target
  escape.
- If he engages you in combat, play Prepare Assault Teams and hope that
  he chooses the wrong team to engage.
- Cancel the battle by sacrificing a hologram with I'm A Doctor, Not A
  Doorstop.
- If the target is engaged and abducted, play Mercy Kill to kill the
  target and again, discard his objective.
- On your turn, after the personnel battle, move away from his ship
  (with his stopped Borg still aboard), perhaps depriving him of adequate
  staffing to move a Borg Cube.
- If he keeps his assimilation table aboard his ship to avoid a trip
  back to his outpost, destroy it with a Disruptor Overload.

Next time, we'll look at part 2 of the strategy, the Assimilate
Homeworld objective.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #43@{ub}


Aefvadh! Last time, we examined Assimilate Counterpart, the necessary
preliminary step to assimilating a homeworld. Now let's move on to the
second step in...


    @{b}ASSIMILATING HOMEWORLDS FOR FUN AND PROFIT: PART 2@{ub}

So you've got yourself a counterpart, either the pre-assimilated Locutus
of Borg, or one of your opponent's personnel, transformed with
Assimilate Counterpart. That's one of the targets you will need in order
to assimilate a homeworld. The other target is, of course, the homeworld
itself. Let's look at the objective:


    @{b}ASSIMILATE HOMEWORLD@{ub}

    Objective, rare, 40 points
    [Borg Use Only], [Hidden Agenda]

Plays on table. Target both an unassimilated homeworld on spaceline and
your matching counterpart. Your Borg may scout that homeworld. If your
counterpart is at that spaceline location, you may probe:
[Com]: Assimilated. Place on homeworld. Cards of that affiliation
(except [AU] cards) may not report to any outpost for rest of game.


This looks very much like Assimilate Planet, except that it's worth an
extra 15 points, and may target only the very planets that Assimilate
Planet must ignore: homeworlds. What is a homeworld? It is a planet
mission whose location is designated in its lore as being the homeworld
to a specific affiliation. So far, there are homeworld missions
corresponding to each of the three fully-realized affiliations.

- Cloaked Mission: @{i}"Romulus: Secretly escort covert operatives to the
  Romulan homeworld."@{ui}
- Expose Covert Supply: @{i}"Qo'noS: Uncover covert supply lines supporting
  rebels on the Klingon Homeworld."@{ui}
- Espionage Mission: @{i}"Earth: Infiltrate Starfleet Headquarters and
  compile an intelligence dossier on this Federation homeworld."@{ui}

Note that homeworld missions are not normally attemptable by that
homeworld's affiliation (except perhaps by Espionage or some other
workaround). The Romulan homeworld is a mission that only Klingons can
attempt; the Klingon homeworld is a mission that only Romulans can
attempt; and the Federation homeworld is a mission that can be attempted
by anyone *except* the Federation. The practical result of this is that
your opponent will rarely, if ever, include his homeworld mission among
his own mission cards. Therefore, if you plan to assimilate your
opponent's homeworld, you will have to include the homeworlds in your
own missions, and you can never count on your opponent to clean the
dilemmas out for you.

Once you have your counterpart, play the Assimilate Homeworld
objective as your card play. Assimilate Counterpart does not allow you to
download your next objective, like Assimilate Planet does, so you either
have to draw it normally, retrieve it from Q's Tent, or, if you have the
Borg Queen in play, go through a two-step download: use the Queen's
skill to download A Change of Plans at the end of the turn when you
assimilate the counterpart, then use A Change of Plans at the start of
your next turn to download the Assimilate Homeworld objective.

When you play Assimilate Homeworld and activate it, you name the
homeworld that matches your counterpart's former affiliation. As noted
in the last review, with a multi-affiliation counterpart, you could
select any of the matching homeworlds. Now you may scout that homeworld.
Scouting proceeds exactly as for Assimilate Planet; you may send down
one scout at a time to encounter dilemmas and Q-Flashes, sending another
as each one gets stopped, killed, etc. Be extremely careful with risking
your counterpart; if he is killed, your objective must be discarded.
When all dilemmas and Q-Flashes are eliminated, scouting is complete.

On your next turn, if your counterpart is present at the homeworld
location (he may be aboard your ship) and assuming you have not battled
at that location in the meantime, you may begin to probe for a
successful outcome. The probe requirement is more stringent for
Assimilate Homeworld: *only* a [Com] subcommand icon will do. However,
as it appears on most of the Borg objectives, on Borg Cubes, and on a
third of the drones, it should not be too difficult to get.

When your probe is successful, place the objective on the homeworld to
mark it assimilated and to score the 40 points. The final effect of the
objective is the one most devastating to your opponent: he may not
report *any* cards of that affiliation, except those with an [AU] icon,
to any outpost for the remainder of the game. He will be limited to the
personnel and ships he already has in play, plus any [AU] or non-aligned
cards he may have in his deck. He may also use a Devidian Door to bring
a personnel into play aboard a ship or on a planet. This restriction
should hamper him enough to allow you to complete one or two more
objectives to reach 100 points.

One advantage to using Locutus of Borg as your counterpart--even if your
opponent is already playing Federation--is that you should be able to
assimilate Earth much earlier in the game, before your opponent has time
to get most of his personnel and ships in play.

You aren't strictly limited to assimilating only one homeworld, either.
A multi-affiliation counterpart would allow you to assimilate both
homeworlds in succession. Or, in a more timeconsuming process, you can
turn your counterpart into a drone with He Will Make An Excellent Drone,
assimilate another one, and assimilate a second homeworld. This works
best against a non-Federation opponent, where you use Locutus of Borg
first to assimilate Earth, turn him into a drone, then assimilate
another counterpart who will be worth points to you while you assimilate
his homeworld.

But Assimilate Homeworld doesn't have to be the end of this strategy,
especially if your opponent is playing Federation. It's only the
preludeto the even nastier strategy of timeline disruption...next time,
right here in the Romulan Reviews.

The Major's Combos:

- Assimilate Homeworld + Revolving Door on opponent's AU Door: Hope you
  have lots of non-aligned personnel.

- Assimilate Homeworld + all three homeworlds: You're prepared for
  three-quarters of your opponents.

        @{b}Major Rakal's Romulan Review #44@{ub}


Aefvadh! Over the last two reviews, we have looked at how you
assimilate first a counterpart, and then a homeworld. You can
stop there if you wish, but if you really want to wreak havoc,
especially for a Federation opponent, you can go on and dabble
in timeline disruption. It's a multi-step process, with a number
of ways for your opponent to foil you, and it takes a lot of
rare cards, but if you can pull it off, it is highly unlikely
that a Federation opponent can make a comeback. Read on for the
full story behind those dreaded words...


    @{b}TIMELINE DISRUPTED IN 2063@{ub}

To disrupt Federation history, you must, as in the movie, stop
humans from making first contact with the Vulcans. Failing that,
you may attempt to build a beacon to contact the Borg in the
Delta Quadrant, who can send help to assimilate Earth despite
first contact. But before you may attempt any of this, you must
first attempt to assimilate Earth in the present. Before we try
to put this together, here is the card text for all the relevant
cards that we haven't examined already.


    @{b}STOP FIRST CONTACT@{ub}

    Objective, rare
    [Borg Use Only], [Countdown 3]

Suspends your Assimilate Homeworld targeting Earth, if scouting
complete. Target Montana Missile Complex (downloading as
necessary). If you have a staffed ship orbiting that location,
you may probe:
[Def]: Phoenix destroyed here. Timeline disrupted in 2063.
Discard objective. Suspended objective completed. May download
one Objective card.


    @{b}MONTANA MISSILE COMPLEX@{ub}

    Time Location, Planet, rare

@{i}"2063 Earth: Historic time of Earth's first warp flight and
contact with extraterrestrials."@{ui}

Plays on table. Seed Phoenix beneath this location from outside
the game (any Zefram Cochrane may acquire it later); Borg player
may download Stop First Contact. Once Phoenix has taken off or
Vulcan Lander has landed here, nullifies Stop First Contact.
Native to this timeline: Zefram Cochrane, Lily Sloane, Phoenix,
Vulcan Lander, Solkar, Sevek, T'Shonra and Kathleen Tonell.


    @{b}BUILD INTERPLEXING BEACON@{ub}

    Objective, rare
    [Borg Use Only]

Suspends your Assimiliate Homeworld targeting Earth, if your
Stop FirstContact was nullified. Target a ship. Your Borg may
scout that target. If your Borg are aboard target orbiting 2063
Earth, you may probe:
[Com],[Def]: Transponder rods are now set in place.
[Nav]: If transponder rods set, place on ship; Timeline
disrupted in 2063 and suspended objective completed.


Now let's look at this one step at a time.

1. First, assimilate a Federation counterpart by completing the
   Assimilate Counterpart objective, or use Locutus of Borg as your
   designated counterpart. For details, see @{"Romulan Review #42" link MRRR42}.

2. Next, play Assimilate Homeworld, targeting Earth (Espionage
   Mission), and scout Earth, encountering and eliminating all
   dilemmas and Q-Flashes. For details, see @{"Romulan Review #43" link MRRR43}. At
   this point, you would normally begin to probe for a [Com] icon.
   However, if you want to disrupt the timeline, don't try to
   complete this objective now. Your actual next step depends on
   which card you have available first, Montana Missile Complex or
   Stop First Contact, because each can download the other.

3A. Let's assume you have Stop First Contact in hand (or A
    Change of Plans, which lets you download an objective). After
    you have completed scouting Earth, play Stop First Contact,
    which suspends Assimilate Homeworld. This is the only way you
    can have two Borg objectives in play. You must target the
    Montana Missile Complex, so if it is not already in play,
    download it into play and carry out its text. This tells you to
    seed the Phoenix under MMC, bringing it in from outside the game
    (the Phoenix could not be in your deck or Q's Tent, because you
    are playing Borg and can't have non-Borg ships in your deck).

3B. On the other hand, if you have Montana Missile Complex in
    hand, play the time location, seed the Phoenix under it, and
    then download Stop First Contact into play as allowed by MMC.
    Note that you could also have played Montana Missile Complex
    earlier in the game and downloaded Stop First Contact into your
    hand at that time. This is riskier because you could be forced
    by certain cards to discard the objective from your hand, and
    because your opponent could bring Zefram Cochrane and Lily
    Sloane into play at the Missile Complex and be ready to take off
    with the Phoenix at any time.

4. Stop First Contact is now your "current objective." No
   scouting is required, but in order to probe you must have a
   staffed ship orbiting the Montana Missile Complex location. To
   travel to a time location, you need either a Temporal Vortex
   doorway, or a pair of Wormhole interrupts. There are advantages
   and disadvantages to each method, but here we will assume you
   use a Temporal Vortex. An open AU doorway is required to play
   Temporal Vortex, and it has a [Countdown 3] icon, so it will
   self-nullify at the end of your third turn, counting the current
   turn. Move your staffed ship(s) from Espionage Mission to
   Montana Missile Complex, and at the end of your turn, if you
   haven't battled there, you can begin probing for a [Def] icon.

5. You have three turns, counting the current one, to get a
   successful probe before Stop First Contact self-nullifies. Your
   opponent may battle you at 2063 Earth to prevent you from
   probing during this time. There are two ways for your opponent
   to nullify the objective, also.
   - He may bring (or report) Zefram Cochrane and either two other
     staff stars or Lily Sloane to Montana Missile Complex, take the
     seeded Phoenix (Cochrane may "acquire" it freely), and take off
     with it.
   - He may land the Vulcan Lander at Montana Missile Complex. It
     could have been reported earlier to the spaceline and brought in
     through the Temporal Vortex, or if not already in play, it must
     be reported directly to Montana Missile Complex (the required
     Vulcan staff may be reported aboard the ship).

6A. If you are successful in probing and complete the Stop First
    Contact objective, the following effects take place:
    - The Phoenix is destroyed. Discard it.
    - The timeline is disrupted and the Federation ceases to exist.
    - Discard the Stop First Contact objective.
    - Your suspended Assimilate Homeworld objective is automatically
      completed without further probing. Score 40 points and place it
      on Earth.
    - You may download a new objective card if you wish.

6B. If Stop First Contact is nullified before you achieve a
    successful probe, Assimilate Homeworld once again becomes your
    current objective. You may either probe for its completion, or
    you may make one last attempt at disrupting the spaceline, by
    playing Build Interplexing Beacon. Like Stop First Contact, this
    objective suspends Assimilate Homeworld again, but it may *only*
    be played if your Stop First Contact was nullified. While Build
    Interplexing Beacon has no countdown icon and does not
    self-nullify, it may be nullified by the interrupt Assimilate
    This!, costing you 10 points. Target a ship, either your
    opponent's or your own. Scout the target ship, i.e., beam a
    scout to the opponent's ship, or if you have Borg on your own
    ship that you targeted, you can consider it scouted at the end
    of that turn. On your next turn (if you haven't battled there),
    if you have Borg aboard the target ship orbiting 2063 Earth, you
    can begin probing for the first of two required probes.

7. The first probe requires either a [Com] or a [Def] icon. When
   you find one of those icons on your probe card, "Transponder
   rods are now set in place." A [Nav] icon on a subsequent probe,
   after transponder rods are set, completes the objective. You
   must get a [Com] or [Def] probe before you can make use of a
   [Nav] probe. Completing the objective yields the following
   effects:
   - Place the Build Interplexing Beacon objective on the target
     ship.
   - The timeline is disrupted and the Federation ceases to exist.
   - Your suspended Assimilate Homeworld objective is automatically
     completed without further probing. Score 40 points and place it
     on Earth.

Successfully disrupting the timeline through either objective
has dire consequences for a Federation opponent. Federation
history ceases to exist, so all related cards are removed from
play unless they are "protected." Go through *both* players'
cards in play, in hand, and in draw decks, side decks, and
discard piles, remove all unprotected humans and cards with
Federation affiliation icons, and put them out-of-play. "Humans"
includes part-humans, assimilated humans, and Borg whose
biological distinctiveness is human (not "humanoid"). Cards with
Federation affiliation icons include single- and
multi-affiliation personnel, ships, and outposts. Cards that are
protected (and not placed out-of-play) are those that are not
human, not Federation affiliation, those with [AU] icons, cards
which are at a time location, and cards which are
time-travelling (e.g., in a Temporal Rift or Time Travel Pod).
If a protected card is aboard an unprotected outpost or ship,
the protected card returns to the owner's hand.

While the most drastic effects are felt by the Federation, some
cards belonging to (or used by) other affiliations will also be
at risk. Romulans will lose Sela (half-human) and Tallera
(Federation icon), though not Major Rakal or Stefan DeSeve (they
are protected by their AU icons). The Klingons presently have no
part-human or multi-affiliation Kli/Fed personnel. Non-aligned
non-AU humans include Devinoni Ral, Galen, Ira Graves, Ishara
Yar, Jenice Manheim, Kareen Brianon, Nick Locarno, and Paul
Manheim.

Here's a concise summary of the timeline disruption scenario.

1. Assimilate a Federation counterpart or play Locutus of Borg.

2. Target Earth with Assimilate Homeworld and complete scouting.

3. Suspend Assimilate Homeworld by playing Stop First Contact;
   play Montana Missile Complex and seed Phoenix under it. (Or may
   be done in reverse order.)

4. Bring a staffed ship to Montana Missile Complex and probe for
   [Def]. A successful probe disrupts the timeline and completes
   Assimilate Homeworld.

5. Stop First Contact may be nullified by the Phoenix taking off
   or the Vulcan Lander landing at MMC, or by your failure to probe
   successfully before the end of the 3-turn countdown.

6. If SFC nullified, play Build Interplexing Beacon to
   re-suspend Assimilate Homeworld. Target a ship (may be your own)
   and scout it.

7. With your Borg aboard scouted target orbiting 2063 Earth,
   probe for [Com] or [Nav]. Once successful, probe for [Def]. A
   successful probe disrupts the timeline and completes Assimilate
   Homeworld.


The Major's Combos:

This whole strategy is one giant combo. Here are the cards you
will need to have in order to disrupt the timeline (in addition
to Borg ships, personnel, etc.):

Assimilate Counterpart (U) or Locutus of Borg (limited edition)
Assimilation Table (U) (unless using Locutus of Borg)
Assimilate Homeworld (R)
Espionage Mission (R)
Stop First Contact (R)
Montana Missile Complex (R)
Temporal Vortex (U) or Wormholes x2 (C)
Phoenix (R)
Build Interplexing Beacon (R)

Major Rakal's Romulan Review #45
02/01/98

Aefvadh! One of the new game features introduced in First Contact was
designed to introduce a little randomness into such activities as the
completion of objectives and resolution of certain dilemmas. Let's give
this new mechanism...


    @{b}A PROBING ANALYSIS@{ub}

In simplest terms, probing means examining a card from your draw deck
and carrying out a set of instructions depending upon which, if any,
icons appear on the card.

Timing and Conditions

Probing is not something you do automatically, like drawing a card to
end your turn; it is always either allowed ("you may probe") or required
(no "may"), explicitly, by a card, most often an objective. If that card
says "immediately probe", you would do so whenever you met the
conditions calling for probing. If it does not say "immediately", then
the probe *always* takes place at the end of your turn, just before your
card draw.

Any card *allowing* probing will give the conditions under which you may
do so. For example, Assimilate Planet says you must have Borg at the
spaceline location in order to probe. Visit Cochrane Memorial requires
you to have an unopposed human ENGINEER present at the objective site.
However, all Borg objectives involving scouting have one precondition
for probing that is part of the rules, and not on the objective; you
must have completed scouting (according to the definitions for scouting
in the rules supplement) on a previous turn. Also, you may not probe for
any Borg objective (unless it says "immediately probe", such as
Eliminate Starship) if you battled at that location during the current
turn or your opponent's previous turn.

A card *requiring* probing may have no conditions, such as the dilemma
My First Raygun; when you encounter it, you probe.

How to Probe

Assume it's the end of your turn, just before your card draw, and you
have met the conditions for probing on an objective card.
- Turn over the top card of your draw deck. This is called the "probe
  card." Your opponent must be able to see the card to verify the results
  of your probe. If you have no draw deck, you cannot probe.
- On the objective card will be a list of possible icons to look for,
  and corresponding "outcomes" for those icons. This is called the "probe
  list." There may be one or more entries in the list, and each entry may
  consist of one or more icons.
- Look on the probe card for any of the icons in the first entry of the
  probe list. If you find one of those icons *anywhere* on the probe card,
  that establishes the outcome of your probe. First replace the probe card
  on your draw deck, then carry out the instructions for that outcome.
- If none of the icons for the first entry are found on the probe card,
  look for icons in the second entry, and so on, until you find a match,
  then replace the probe card and execute that outcome.
- If none of the icons in any entry match the probe card, there may be
  an "Otherwise" entry. If so, replace the probe card on your draw deck
  and execute the "otherwise" outcome.
- If none of the icons match and there is no "otherwise" entry, just
  replace the probe card and do nothing.
- After executing the appropriate outcome, you have reached the end of
  your turn. Assuming you are entitled to do so (i.e., you haven't played
  a Q's Tent or other card this turn that sacrifices your card draw), draw
  your card to end your turn.

What Icons Qualify?

When you look for an icon on the probe card, it counts as a match if you
find the icon *anywhere* on the card--a card type or affiliation icon at
the top; personnel staffing, subcommand, Alternate Universe, or other
icons in the "staffing area"; ship staffing icons; or icons in the game
text. A few examples of the icons that appear on certain cards:
- Assimilate Counterpart: Objective, Borg Use Only, Hidden Agenda,
  Communications, Navigation, Defense, First Contact set icon
- U.S.S. Enterprise-C: Federation affiliation, Command star, Staff star,
  Alternate Universe
- Tallera: Federation, Romulan, and Non-aligned affiliation icons,
  Command star, Fajo Collection icon

The Rest of the Story

The outcome of your probe will usually tell you what to do with the card
allowing or requiring the probe. You may be instructed to discard it
(Eliminate Starship) or to place it on the target (all the Assimilate
objectives). A dilemma requiring probing is discarded (or not) according
to standard dilemma rules; e.g., if it has no conditions, it is
discarded. If there is no instruction for a non-dilemma card allowing
probing, leave it where it is (e.g., Visit Cochrane Memorial).

You may continue probing on each turn for which you meet the conditions,
until the card allowing or requiring probing is discarded, nullified, or
completed. Thus, you will only probe once for Eliminate Starship,
because you are told to discard it; you may probe each turn until you
reach a successful outcome for an Assimilate objective; and Visit
Cochrane Memorial allows probing each turn for the entire game, as long
as it is not destroyed (e.g., if Earth is assimilated).

If you find an icon match, but are prevented from executing the related
outcome, replace the probe card and do nothing. Once you find a match,
you do not look for any others. For example, Visit Cochrane Memorial
calls for you to draw one card if you find a Federation affiliation icon
on the probe card. But if you played a Q's Tent this turn, you are not
allowed to draw any cards. If the probe card was Guinan, you will find
both a Federation icon *and* a Fajo Collection icon on the card, but you
cannot continue down the list and execute the "download one card"
outcome for the Fajo icon; your outcome is to draw a card, which you
cannot do.

The text of the card allowing probing may override some of the rules
presented here. For example, although you normally replace the probe
card on the draw deck, Eliminate Starship instructs you to draw the
probe card (into your hand), while My First Raygun requires you to
discard the probe card.

At some point, you may be allowed to probe by two different cards on a
turn; this is not currently possible because the Borg may have only one
current objective at a time, and the only end of turn probing card for
non-Borg is Visit Cochrane Memorial. If you did have two card allowing
probing, you would still look only at the top card of your draw deck,
and examine it separately for the probe icons for each probe-enabling
card. You may execute the respective outcomes in any order you wish.

Simple Example (one possible outcome)

ESTABLISH GATEWAY

"...Your Borg may scout that location. If you have Borg there, you may
probe:
[Com],[Nav]: Sector cleared. Place on location. Download to here one
Transwarp Network Gateway (if possible). May download one Objective
card." [25 points]

You completed scouting last turn and have not battled since. You have a
Borg on a ship at the location. At the end of this turn, you probe. Your
top card is Amanda Rogers, which has no subcommand icons; there is no
"otherwise" entry in the probe list. Replace Amanda Rogers on your draw
deck. Now end your turn.

Next turn, you probe again. The probe card is Assimilate Homeworld,
which has the [Com] subcommand icon (in its own probe list). Your probe
is successful and you carry out all instructions assciated with this
outcome. Since the objective is completed, you do not probe again.

Complex Example (two cards, multiple outcomes possible)

Because there are not yet two existing probe-enabling cards that may be
in play together, I will use the hypothetical Upgrade Starship objective
from the FC rules, along with Visit Cochrane Memorial. They illustrate a
variety of interesting interactions.

UPGRADE STARSHIP

[Fed], [Event]: Progress. Draw one card.
[Doorway], [Equipment]: Equipment failure. Discard objective.
[AU]: Upgraded: Place on target. It is now RANGE +3.
[Otherwise]: Discard one card.

VISIT COCHRANE MEMORIAL

[Fed], [Objective]: "Oooh." Draw one card.
[Event], [Interrupt]: "Aaaaah." Play one card.
[Fajo], [Equipment]: "Wow!" Download one card.
[NA], [Doorway]: "I thought it'd be bigger." Discard one card.

Let's assume you meet the requirements for probing each turn, and look
at the results of several probes on successive turns.

1. Galen. He has a NA icon, but also a Federation affiliation icon in
his restriction box. Because the Federation icon is in the first entry
for both objectives, you look for that first, and so you will draw one
card for each objective. (Note that the fact that Galen's NA icon
appears at the top of his card does not affect the outcome. You examine
the probe *list* from top to bottom, not the probe *card*.) Replace
Galen on your draw deck, then draw the top two cards. End your turn by
drawing another.

2. Kivas Fajo-Collector. Examining first for the Upgrade Starship probe
list, you find an event icon, so that objective lets you draw one card.
Don't do it yet. Next examine for the VCM probe list. There are no
Federation or Objective icons on the card, but the next entry contains
the Event icon, so your outcome for VCM is to play one card. Replace
Kivas Fajo-Collector on your draw deck, and execute the two outcomes in
whatever order you wish. For example, you may draw the Kivas Fajo, and
then play it (drawing three cards). Or you may play a card from your
hand, and then draw the Kivas for later use. End your turn by drawing a
card.

3. Spot. None of the icons in the Upgrade Starship probe list appear
anywhere on Spot, so you will execute the "otherwise" outcome of
discarding one card (not yet). Looking through the VCM list, the Fajo
icon is the first one found on Spot, which allows you to download one
card. Replace Spot on the draw deck. You may discard first and then
download, or you may download first, perhaps for a card that you know
you will not be using this game, so you can discard it instead of a more
valuable card from your hand. Shuffle your deck if you download from it,
and then draw to end your turn.

4. Commander Tomalak. For Upgrade Starship, your outcome is "Upgraded,"
for the AU icon. Place the completed objective on the target ship. None
of the icons in VCM's probe list appear on Commander Tomalak, and there
is no "otherwise," so you do nothing for this objective. Replace the
probe card, then draw.

5. Tallera. On this turn, you played a Q's Tent. The first icon
encountered from VCM's probe list is the Federation icon. Your outcome
is to draw a card, but the Q's Tent play prohibits it. You cannot
execute the Fajo icon outcome. Replace the probe card and declare your
turn ended.

6. Tallera. No Q's Tent this turn, so you will get to draw a card for
VCM. Replace Tallera, then draw her, plus one more to end your turn.
Note that you get no card draw from Upgrade Starship, because the
objective was completed.
