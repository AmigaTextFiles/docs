    From the @{"Glossary" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/MAIN"}:

This objective has errata (the deletion of "Captain's Order."):
Seeds or plays on table. You may download to one of your outposts up
to two different mission specialists that you do not already have in
play. Also, while in play, each of your mission specialists scores 5
bonus points whenever they use their skill to meet a mission requirement.
You may voluntarily discard objective at start of any of your turns. (Unique.)

This objective has two effects. First, it allows a one-time download of
two mission specialists to an outpost (not to any other type of
facility). If you choose to use the optional download, you must do so
immediately upon seeding or playing the objective. (In order to download
during the seed phase, you must already have seeded an outpost. The
mission specialists are not seed cards, however, but come from your draw
deck or Q's Tent.) Because the card is "Unique," if you wish to play
another Assign Mission Specialists later to download two more
specialists, you must first discard the one in play at the start of your
turn. (See @{"unique and universal" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/UNIQUEANDUNIVERSAL"}.) If the download of the mission
specialists is prevented by the activation of @{"Computer Crash" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/COMPCRASH"}, this
objective remains in play on the table for its second function. The
download opportunity is permanently lost; it cannot be "saved" for later
use.

Second, while you have any Assign Mission Specialists card in play, any
mission specialists you have in play (regardless of whether downloaded
or played normally) score 5 points when using their skill to complete a
mission. The extra points are not limited to the specialists downloaded
with the AMS card currently in play.

You decide which of your personnel present use their skills in meeting
mission requirements. A mission specialist's skill may be used even if
another personnel present also possesses that skill, and a personnel
with a skill at the x2 level or higher is not required to use all of his
levels of that skill. However, two mission specialists with the same
skill may not both score 5 points when satisfying the same skill
requirement (unless the mission requires that skill at x2 level or
higher, thus allowing both of them to "use their skill").

For example, the mission Reported Activity requires
Navigation + Honor x2.
It is solved by the following Away Team:

B'iJik (Navigation, mission specialist)
Konmel (Navigation, mission specialist)
Kahless (Honor x2, mission specialist)
Batrell (Honor, mission specialist)
Governor Worf (Honor x2 plus other skills, not a mission specialist)

A maximum of 15 extra points may be scored (5 by Kahless, 5 by Batrell,
and 5 by either B'iJik or Konmel, but not both). Kahless is not forced
to meet the entire Honor x2 by himself, nor is Governor Worf required to
use his Honor at all.

    For a description of terms used see @{"Legend" link LEGEND}.

    From the @{"Glossary" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/MAIN"}:

If you wish to use the first two functions of this objective, you must
seed two copies (or seed the first and play the second). If you seed
only one and have a Q-Continuum side deck, you must declare which function
you are seeding the card for.

To use the first function of this objective, you do not need to have a
Q-Continuum side deck or a seeded Q-Flash. It allows seeding of Q-icon
dilemmas only (not other Q-icon card types).

If you have completed scouting a mission, but have not completed the
objective, and either player seeds a Q-Flash under the location using
Beware of Q, then scouting is no longer complete. You must resolve the
Q-Flash to complete scouting again before you can probe on your next
turn. Or, you may use A Change of Plans to target the mission with a new
objective requiring that the mission be "not yet scouted."

However, once you have completed the objective, you may not target the
mission with another objective requiring that it be "not yet scouted,"
even by seeding a Q-Flash under the mission. Likewise, you could not
solve a mission, seed a Q-Flash under it, and then attempt and solve it
again for more points.
