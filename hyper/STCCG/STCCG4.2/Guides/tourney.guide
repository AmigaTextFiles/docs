    Important Announcement about Star Trek CCG
    Sanctioned Tournaments

    Star Trek Customizable Card Game: Silver
    Border Cards

    ------------
    by Carol Wisely
    ------------

    May 29 1997 - We have been receiving a large
    amount of feedback from players of the Star
    Trek Customizable Card Game concerning the
    use of silver-border cards in tournament
    play. It was always Decipher's intention to
    ban these cards from sanctioned events. That
    is the usual nature of Collector's sets in
    the CCG industry and is one of the reasons
    why the sets can be purchased for far less
    than the cost of a complete set of white
    border or black border cards.

    However, we do recognize the need to increase
    tournament competition for this game. It is a
    high priority for us, along with the renewed
    development effort associated with the
    signing of the new licence. We know that you,
    the players, want to see increased attendance
    at tournaments and the opportunity to face
    more opponents. This, coupled with a great
    product, is the lifeblood of the hobby.

    Therefore, we have decided to allow the
    silver border cards that were part of the
    Star Trek: The Next Generation Customizable
    Card Game Collector's Set to be used in
    sanctioned tournament play, and will be
    amending the tournament guide accordingly. We
    will also allow them to be used at the
    Regional and Open qualifiers for the 1997
    World Championships.

    We reserve the right to review this decision
    in the future, but would give plenty of
    advance notice if we felt the need to revert
    back to the original ruling.

    We have made this decision based on your
    feedback about the negative effect this would
    have on tournament attendance. We all want to
    see vigorous, healthy tournament turn-outs
    for this game. We look forward to seeing that
    grow throughout 1997 as our sanctioned scheme
    begins to roll out!

  Tournaments must always be played according to the most current rules as
  defined by the rules booklet, rules supplements, and FAQ (Frequently Asked
  Questions) documents. Please have these documents on hand during tournament
  play. If the rules or FAQ do not fully answer a question or disagreement, the
  tournament director is the final authority.

@TOC CONTENT

@{b}E. Player rating systems@{ub}

  Decipher's player rating systems are based on player participation in
  sanctioned tournaments. They allow players to see how they measure in skill
  against other players around the world.

  The ratings systems are based on the ELO system, in which each player¹s
  rating depends on how well they do in each tournament and the ratings of
  their opponents in that tournament. The rating is a number between 0 and 3000,
  with the average around 1500. The more expert the player, the higher
  their rating.

  This system, the universal standard for rating chess tournament players for 40
  years, has proven to be as objective and accurate as possible.

  Decipher is developing a software package called "The Tournament Organizer"
  to become available soon. When released it will be included in the tournament
  kit.

@{b}A.

The official Decipher sanctioned tournament formats@{ub}

Decipher sanctions tournaments that follow three different formats:
the Decipher Swiss format, the Decipher Junior format and the Decipher sealed
deck format.

These formats are considered separate for rating purposes and a separate rating
database will be created for each. Playing in one type of tournament has no
effect on a player's rating for the other two types.

In sanctioned tournaments, of any format, there are only a few deck
construction guidelines:

- The card "Raise the Stakes" is not allowed in tournament play.
- Each player may seed only one artifact per mission location,
  unless otherwise specified (e.g. on Cryosatellite). If you
  illegally seed two or more artifacts at the same location, all
  of your artifacts there are mis-seeded.
- Artifacts cannot be used until they have been earned (i.e., by
  completing the mission) or acquired (e.g., according to The
  Charybdis or a Survey Drone). If an artifact is discarded,
  nullified, or destroyed, it cannot be brought back into play
  unless it is first re-seeded (e.g., with Q's Planet) and earned
  or acquired again.
- At the end of the seed phase, any unused seed cards are placed
  out-of-play, not discarded. All mis-seeded cards are also placed
  out-of-play whenever they are discarded.

The combination of Telepathic Alien Kidnappers and Alien Probe is allowed, but
be aware of the new ruling on this combination. After you guess a card type,
your opponent may shuffle his hand and leave it face-down before you make
your selection.

Apart from these guidelines, both white and black border cards from the
Star Trek Customizable Card Game universe are allowable for use in tournaments
as soon as they are released. Decipher reserves the right to adapt this policy
in regional events if particular cards are not available to everyone in time.
Side boards (spare cards for changing decks between games) are not allowed
(except in sealed deck tournaments). Side decks (such as Q¹s Tent and Q-Flash)
are allowed as per the normal rules of play.

@Endnode

@Node SWISSFORMAT "Tournament Rules/Sanctioned Tournaments/Swiss Format"
@TOC CONTENT

@{b}I.      The Decipher Swiss tournament format@{ub}

This format, based on traditional Swiss-style tournament play, is designed
to test players' abilities against a number of different opponents. Each
player must come to the tournament with one deck adhering to the 30/30 rule
(maximum 30 seed cards, minimum 30 draw deck cards) as outlined in the
@{"First Contact Rules" link "STCCG:fc.guide/FCRULES"} Supplement.

A Swiss type tournament consists of a number of games. We recommend that,
whenever possible, tournaments with more than 32 entrants should include at
least 6 games. This estimate is based upon Decipher's observation of numerous
tournaments. If time is an issue, the tournament director may set a time
limit of no less than one hour per game, which must be announced before each
game begins.

Running the tournament
(Using the software will change this routine. This will be covered in the
accompanying  documentation.)

1. Preparation
   Make a copy of the PADD Display card enclosed in your tournament kit for
   each player in the tournament.

2. Distribute cards
   Give each player a PADD Display card to complete.

   If each card is not filled out correctly and legibly, the entire tournament
   may not be rated. (Please remind players to use a consistent form for their
   name and address every time they enter a tournament. Switching between name,
   initial and nick-name will cause delays in getting the results incorporated
   into the ratings scheme.) Shuffle the completely filled out PADD Display
   cards and place them in a single pile.

3. First pairings
   Take the top two cards off the pile. Pair off these two cards, noting the
   name of each player¹s opponent on their PADD Display card. Then the third
   and fourth cards are paired, and so on. Continue pairing players in this
   way until all cards are drawn. You must note opponent's name on each card.
   If there is an odd number of players competing in the tournament, a "bye"
   (for that game) will be assigned to the player with the last PADD Display
   card remaining.

4. Starting play
   Once the pairings are complete, the tournament is ready to begin. If games
   are to be timed, the director must announce a time limit of no less than
   60 minutes per game at the beginning of the game.

5. Reporting the game score
   When players complete their first game, they must approach the director's
   table together to report the results. Players should not mark their PADD
   Display cards. Mark each player's card with their game score. (Scoring will
   be explained in more detail below.) Collect all PADD Display cards,
   including the card from a player with a bye if there was one.

6. Subsequent pairings
   When all players have completed play and you have marked all PADD Display
   cards with the results of the first games, form a pile and arrange the
   cards in the pile in descending order according to the player's total
   score, with the highest score on top, second highest score beneath it, and
   so on until the card with the lowest score is on the bottom.

   For the second game, pair the highest scoring player with the second-highest
   scoring player. Their cards should be the top two cards of your pile. Then,
   pair the third and fourth highest scoring players, and so on, until all
   players have been paired. If there is an odd number of players, let the last
   player left receive the bye for the next game. If that player has previously
   received a bye in this tournament, reassign the bye to the next highest
   player (that has not already received a bye).

   It is possible that players could be matched up to face the same opponent
   more than once. In this event, an attempt must be made to modify the
   pairing. In this situation, pair the player with the next highest ranked
   player after the one he was originally supposed to play. If he has already
   faced that person, pair him against the next highest ranked player. Then
   continue the pairings.

   For example, if the 5th ranked player has already played the 6th ranked
   player, he would instead be matched up with the 7th ranked player. If he
   had already faced the 7th ranked player, he would then be matched up with
   the 8th ranked player, and so on.

   In the rare case that the player has already faced all of the players
   remaining in the pile, then leave the pairing as it originally was.

7. Subsequent games
   For the next and all subsequent games, repeat step 6.

8. End of tournament
   After the final game, the person with the highest score (including the
   differential, if necessary, as a tie-breaker) is the winner. If there is
   a tie with both points and differential, a tie-breaker game can be played.


@{b}Tournament scoring@{ub}

A player's score is a combination of victory points and differential
points. Players generally score 2 victory points for a win, 0 for a
loss. (Do not confuse victory points with the game points that are
accumulated during a game). In the case where a player wins by having
more points when both player's deck are exhausted, only 1 victory
point is awarded for the win. Differential points are determined by
the difference between the winner's game point score and the loser's
game point score. For the purposes of computing differential, if the
game point score is less than zero treat it as zero; if it is greater
than 100 treat it as a 100. The differential is always recorded in
parentheses after the victory point score.

For example, if a player won a game 120 to 65, he would receive a score
of 2(+35) and his opponent would receive a score of 0(-35). If a player
won a game 80 to 20 (via deck exhaustion), he would receive a score of
1(+60) and his opponent would receive a score of 0(-60).

After each game, update the player's cumulative score by adding the victory
points and the differential for this game to his previous cumulative score.
For example, a player has played two games. In the first he scored 2(+35)
and in the second he scored 0(-60). His cumulative score at this point
is 2(-25).


@{b}Special scoring situations@{ub}

@{i}Bye@{ui}

If a player has received a bye he scores 2 victory points with 0 differential,
or 2(+0).

@{i}Quitting@{ui}

If a player quits after pairings have been made or during a game, he should
receive a full loss for that game. The winner is awarded 2 victory points and
his score is immediately raised to whatever it would take to win the game
normally (typically 100). The differential is computed based on this scoring.
The quitter receives the equivalent negative differential. The director may
impose a flat +50/-50 differential if he feels that this is more reasonable.
Players who quit a game should not be allowed to play in the rest of the
tournament. Quitting is NOT a strategic option.


@{b}Special cards@{ub}

There are two cards that can alter the game's victory conditions:
Q's Planet and Devidian Door.

Intermix Ratio:
Since the excess bonus points do not apply toward winning, your final score
for the game, for the purposes of computing differential, would be your
non-bonus points plus your bonus points, up to a maximum of double your
non-bonus points. Thus, if you had 35 non-bonus points, and 50 bonus points,
your score would be 70.

If a player plays a card via Devidian Door and cannot show the Door on his
next turn, that player loses and gets a score of 0(-100). His opponent
receives a score of 2(+100).

The card Q's Planet increases the points required to win a game by 40. If,
at the conclusion of any game, a player's score exceeds 100, treat that player
as if he had 100 points for computing differential. If both players' scores
exceed 100, give the winner a +1 differential (and the loser a -1 differential).


@{b}Timed out games@{ub}

When a game is being played within a pre-determined time limit, and if time
is called and play is not completed, the director must impose the "hands down"
rule in which play stops immediately. That game is now considered completed.
The person with the most points is declared the winner. Then the differential
is calculated. The winner receives only 1 victory point plus the differential.
The loser receives 0 victory points and the negative value of the winner's
differential.


@{b}True Ties@{ub}

A true tie occurs if both players end the game with the same score. This can
happen when a game ends via deck exhaustion or when the "hands down" rule is
enforced. In this case, both players receive 1 victory point and 0 differential.

@{b}II.     The Decipher Junior tournament format@{ub}

The Junior format is exactly the same as the Decipher Swiss format, except for
the following differences:

        € Participants are limited to players aged 14 years old and younger
        € Deck size must folloew the "20/20 rule" (maximum of 20 seed cards,
          and minimum of 20 draw deck cards). Only 4 missions are allowed
          per deck.
        € Players play to 75 points instead of 100 (and the maximum
          differential possible in a game is +75)
        € Timed games are no less than 50 minutes

Scoring and pairing is identical to the method outlined in the Decipher Swiss
format.

@Node SEALFORMAT "Tournament Rules/Sanctioned Tournaments/Sealed Deck Format"
@TOC CONTENT

@{b}III.    The Decipher sealed deck tournament format@{ub}

A sealed deck tournament is played with unopened Premiere starter decks
(limited or unlimited) and often an assortment of expansion packs. Players
may bring their own sealed decks and packs, and you should have decks on hand
for players to purchase. In addition, it is the tournament director's
responsibility to provide an additional number of common cards for use during
the deck building period. Alternatively, players may bring their own common
cards.

1. Cards available
   Each player signed up for the tournament is to bring one starter deck and
   one expansion pack (of any kind) or must purchase one from the director.
   In addition, each player must bring or be provided with a Warp Pack and
   should bring a stock of common cards. Alternately, the tournament director
   may have Warp Packs and common cards available for use. If these are
   unavailable, players may bring the cards present in a Warp Pack for deck
   construction and players may use proxies of common cards by marking up their
   unused cards. All players must use expansion packs from the same set.

2. Deck construction
   Each player now takes their deck, expansion pack, and Warp Pack and has
   30 minutes to create a 60-card, 6-mission deck. In addition, each player
   may take any three common cards to add to this mix. (This gives each player
   a total of 90 cards from which to build their 60-card deck.) The three
   common cards can only come from the Premiere set or from expansions being
   used in the tournament. No other cards may be brought into the tournament
   or traded for during the tournament.

3. Playing
   Once decks are built, the tournament should be run by the Decipher Swiss
   rules. Between games, players may re-customize their decks by swapping, on
   a one-for-one basis, cards from their play decks with their 30 unused cards.

Tournament directors may wish to increase the number of cards available by
adding more expansion packs to the mix, at their discretion. These sealed deck
events will still be sanctioned and rated.

@{b}I.      Simple Swiss format@{ub}

The simple Swiss format is run like the Decipher Swiss format, except that
player scores are not taken into account in subsequent pairings after the
first round, or in deciding who shall receive a bye. The tournament director
should handle the PADD Display cards the same way they would in the Decipher
Swiss format, except that the piles of cards are stacked randomly (rather than
in descending order). To determine who receives a bye in a round, simply take
the odd card remaining after player pairings are done, and give that person a
bye.

@{b}II.     Elimination format@{ub}

The advantage of a single elimination tournament format is its simplicity,
and its ability to handle a large number of players in the fewest possible
games. The disadvantage is that players have to win to continue, which may
be intimidating and discouraging to newcomers.

Use the table below to determine how many games need to be played to arrive at
a winner:

        # of Players                    Required # of games
        5-8                                     3
        9-16                                    4
        17-32                                   5
        33-64                                   6
        65-128                                  7

Draw up the brackets, as in the example below. To determine the number of
brackets, count the actual number of players in the tournament. Compare that
number to the next lowest power of two (the powers of two are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,
128, etc.), and draw that many brackets in the first column. For instance, if
there are 53 players, draw 32 brackets (which could hold up to 64 players).
If there are 67 players, draw 64 brackets (which could hold up to 128 players)


Sample Bracket set up: (4 brackets for a tournament with 5 to 8 players)
             Game 1      Game 2    Game 3
Bracket 1   __________
            __________
                        __________
                        __________
Bracket 2   __________
            __________
                                   __________
                                   __________     _________
Bracket 3   __________                                      The WINNER
            __________
                        __________
                        __________
Bracket 4   __________
            __________

Get each player to put their name on a small card. Shuffle these cards. Take
the top card and write that player's name in the top line of bracket #1.
Write the second player¹s name in the top line of bracket #2, and so on,
until each bracket has a player's name written in the top line. Return to
bracket #1 and continue writing the names of players on the lower line in
each bracket until you run out of player names.

All empty lower lines in each bracket should be filled in with the word "bye."
The players opposing a bye automatically move on to the second game. Unless
the number of players is an exact power of two, there will always be at least
one player with a first game bye. Setting brackets in this manner ensures that
there will not be any byes after the first game.

The winner of the final game wins the tournament.

@Node CONDUCT "Tournament Rules/Code of Conduct"
@TOC CONTENT

@{b}III. Code of conduct@{ub}

In order to ensure fair play, Decipher has created a Code of conduct for all tournaments. Please pay close
attention to each of these points. While some of these rules might seem a bit excessive, they are all based
upon good sportsmanship and intended for the benefit of everyone involved.

1. We insist that everyone count their opponents¹ cards before and after each game. It may seem
discourteous to your opponent, but there have been instances where people have accidentally left cards out
of their deck. It is also easy in this game to misplace a card in your opponent¹s territory and forget to
retrieve it after a game. It is of benefit to everybody to have their decks double-checked.

2. Players may ask to know their opponent¹s points in a game at any time.

3. All cards in your decks (draw deck and side decks) should be oriented in one direction. If a player notices
that an opponent¹s cards are not all oriented in the same way, he can ask for them to be re-oriented.

4. When players place cards in their discard piles or take a card from their discard pile to their hand or play,
the opponent must have the opportunity to see the cards.

5. If any form of misplay (accidental or intentional) is suspected, it is up to the player to call over a judge
right away. The only opportunity to correct an error is to catch it during play. Complaints raised after a
game are too late. Once a game is finished, the
result stands.

6. After a game, the two opponents must approach the scorer¹s table together. All scores must be filled out
by the tournament score keeper and the results signed by each player.

7. No writing is allowed during play, except to record information that is readily available to both players,
such as the gender and classification of a Soong-Type Android or the skill possessed by K¹chiQ. You could
not, for instance, write down the dilemmas underneath a mission, even if you looked at them with a Scan
card.

8. Tournament directors may not play in their own tournaments.

@Node GLOSSARY "Tournament Rules/Glossary"
@TOC CONTENT

@{b}IV. Glossary@{ub}

@{i}Bye:@{ui}
Special permission given to a player to "skip" a game or round due to there
being an odd number of players in the tournament.

@{i}Cards, use of proxy:@{ui}
Proxy cards are not allowed in tournament decks (except in the special case
outlined for a sealed-deck tournament).

@{i}Cards, handling discard pile:@{ui}
Players may not look at or touch their own or their opponent's Discard Pile,
unless a card specifically directs them to do so.

@{i}Cards, storing in sleeves:@{ui}
Plastic sleeves are allowed during tournament play. However, if a player is
using sleeves that have any type of logo or other distinguishing mark, that
mark must be oriented in the same corner on the face of every card.

@{i}Cards, marking of:@{ui}
The marking of cards is forbidden. A player may have the tournament director
inspect any cards, even during play, if they suspect an opponent of having
marked cards.

@{i}Cards, swapping of:@{ui}
At no point during a tournament may a player swap or trade any cards in their
tournament deck with any other cards. (The only exception to this is during a
sealed deck tournament. Players may swap with their remaining unused cards
between games, if the tournament director allows it.)

@{i}Differential:@{ui}
The difference in game point score between the winning player and losing
player.

@{i}Dilemmas, encountering:@{ui}
It is suggested that, instead of flipping over the entire mission card,
players instead slide out the bottom-most seed card when attempting a mission
and look at it, sliding it back under if it remains under the mission. This
way, there will be no chance of "accidentally" seeing the next seed card.

@{i}FAQ:@{ui}
An official Frequently Asked Questions document published by Decipher.

@{i}Final authority:@{ui}
The tournament director has final authority in judgments on cheating, misuse
of cards, game disruption, rules, timing, stalling and deck construction
during their own tournaments. Tournament directors may apply this control only
during tournaments they run. Tournament directors can play in tournaments run
by other directors. However, they have no rule jurisdiction during these events.
Under normal circumstances, judges rulings will not be overturned by Decipher.

@{i}Full:@{ui}
A game is considered "full" if it is completed before time is called or before
a player's deck is exhausted.

@{i}Hands down:@{ui}
The term used when a director calls "time" on a timed game. All game actions
and responses immediately cease.

@{i}Non-sanctioned tournament:@{ui}
A tournament that does not fully comply with one of Decipher's sanctioned
tournament formats.

@{i}Play, halting of:@{ui}
If a player has a question regarding play, it is the player's responsibility
to halt play and have the question answered by a judge. The judge cannot make
a retroactive decision on an issue once the players have continued to play.

@{i}Quitting:@{ui}
If a player quits after pairings have been made or during a game, he should
receive a full loss for that game. The winner is awarded 2 victory points and
his score is immediately raised to whatever it would take to win the game
normally (typically 100). The differential is computed based on this scoring.
The quitter receives the equivalent negative differential. The director may
impose a flat +50/-50 differential if he feels that this is more reasonable.
Players who quit a game should not be allowed to play in the rest of the
tournament. Quitting is NOT a strategic option.

@{i}Reversal of game actions:@{ui}
When a player takes an action it can only be taken back if such action has
not been resolved yet and has not been responded to by the opposing player.

@{i}Ruling:@{ui}
Any decision made by a tournament director (or appointed judge) regarding
game play. This decision will be based on the official Star Trek Customizable
Card Game rulebook, rules supplements and latest FAQ. If the issue is not
fully covered by these sources, the tournament director (or appointed judge)
will make a judgment call.

@{i}Sanctioned tournament:@{ui}
A tournament where the director and players follow specific Decipher formats
so that their scores may be rated in one of the player rating systems.

@{i}Sanctioned tournament director:@{ui}
A person who has been registered with the Decipher tournament system and is
approved to run sanctioned events.

@{i}Seed cards:@{ui}
A seed card is any card that is put into play before the actual play of the
game begins. This includes, missions, dilemmas, outposts, artifacts, doorways,
and any cards with special instructions for seeding, such as Data's Body or
Mirasta Yale. No more than 30 cards of a players deck may be seed cards (20
cards in a Junior Tournament deck).

@{i}Timed:@{ui}
A game is considered "timed" if it is not completed within a pre-announced
time limit or if both player's deck is exhausted (also known as a "half-win").

@{i}True tie:@{ui}
A game result in which both players have equal points at the end of the game.

@{i}Victory points:@{ui}
The points that are awarded to players for wins during a tournament. Players
are usually awarded 2 victory points for a "full" win and 1 victory point for
a "timed" win, "true tie", or "half win." Players receive 0 victory points for
any type of loss.
