  This has to be one of the most useful cards a Borg player can have in
  their deck. Sure, there are the usual ways of using it, but half the
  fun is in its flexibility. For example: you have targeted your
  opponent's U.S.S. Yamato for Elimination. As you fly by her fully
  staffed U.S.S. Enterprise, you stop, play A Change of Plans.

  Discard (or place in hand if you've got your Queen) your current
  Objective and download...Eliminate Starship! Target the Enterprise and
  avoid your opponent's punches.

  A Change of Plans is also useful in stopping First Contact. Use it to
  download Stop First Contact, then use SFC to grab the Missile Complex.
  It's that easy. A Change of Plans has so many uses, it's impossible to
  explain them all here. So, grab your Borg deck and experiment. Then
  again, you probably do already. If not, it's time for A Change of
  Heart.

  Combos:

  A Change of Plans + Borg Queen:
  Goes without saying (Oops...)

  A Change of Plans + Assimilate Counterpart:
  No thanks, I want HIM instead.

  A Change of Plans + A Change of Plans + A Change of Plans =
  Keep your opponent off guard.

  A Change of Plans + Your current Objective + Your opponent's newly
  solved-mission =
  Great points, Less scouting.

  @{b}@{u}A Change of Plans@{ub}@{uu}
  By W. Marc Crusher

  This is a multiple use card. The most standard application of this beauty
  is to actually change your plans, that is, get rid of your current
  objective, presumably one you don't want to pursue any further, and get
  a new one, quite often one you already have in hand. However, you can make
  much more of this one common Interrupt.

  First, you can use it as a Joker when it comes to drawing Objectives. Due
  to the fact that it can download the Objective from your deck, it is
  essentially free - you used up a card draw on it, but saved one card draw
  on the Objective itself. As a bonus, you even get the card play for free,
  due to the Interrupt nature of the card. Thus no more troublesome decisions
  between playing your much-needed Queen and your equally vital Objective, just
  play both.

  Then, you can use A Change Of Plans for a different variant of changing
  plans, namely changing the target of your current Objective. Just targeted
  Alidar for a counterpart and now your opponent played Lore? Just play
  A Change Of Plans and return the Assimilate Counterpart to your hand (you
  need a Queen for this maneuver, though) and then immediately re-download it.
  Or, of course, there is no rule that forces you to exploit the full potential
  of the card. Just discard a rather troublesome Objective and flip over
  another one you played earlier. Or, if you have enough copies of the card,
  grab an advance copy of an Objective you will want to use later and plop
  it down on the table.

  A word of caution though - there is an easy chance of a mistake when using
  this with Establish Gateway to make an emergency switch of current
  objectives, e.g. to eliminate a starship or some personnel. If you have
  overcome all Dilemmas at a space location and just wait for a successful
  probe draw, don't change your plans unless there is a *real* emergency. As
  the location has already been scouted successfully you cannot return there
  later to get the 25 points. So make sure you leave at least one Dilemma if
  you intend to return. This is particulary vital for a Retask strategy. Some
  players will seed the Borg Ship last, putting some card that hurt non-Borg
  but are just irrelevant to most Borg in front of it. Make sure you grab
  the 25 after the Retask before changing your plans in this scenario!

  With Ready Room Door, matching commanders are more common than ever

  crew that can't beam off its ship or attempt missions can't do much of
  anything. It'll buy you time if you've fallen behind in the game.
  And if they want to battle you to nullify it? That might be just the
  excuse your Borg need for a massive retaliation. Or for your Federation
  to declare Wartime Conditions. Speaking of Federation, don't forget
  you can also really nail someone loading up on the Enterprise-E
  personnel with this card.

  Abandon Mission + opponent's "mega crew":

  Basic Borg material. Like a Kivas Fajo - Collector with an attitude,

  Later on, though you may not use them to get Drones, you'll find them
  invaluable for probing. With all three subcommand icons right there
  in the game text box, you'll probe successfully, no matter what the
  objective.

  There's been a lot of speculation about how exactly the Borg adapt to

  If your Interlink Drones can't overcome a dilemma with skill sharing,
  send one of them (or any other Communication-icon drone) on the next
  turn and play this interrupt to get you past any dilemma.

  Combos:

  If you really need to get that Rift on his ship during his turn, just
  make sure to have an Energy Vortex in your hand. When he tries to

  from @{"First Contact" link "STCCG:fc.guide/MAIN"}

  Apparently, everyone's favorite nurse, Alyssa Ogawa, finally took
  some much-needed night classes at Starfleet Medical, because she has
  emerged bigger and stronger in the new First Contact expansion. Her new
  skills make her more useful than ever before (as if THAT was hard)
  and there is some interesting strategy involving both of her...so
  to speak.

  Combos:

  Alyssa Ogawa + Evaluate Terraforming:
  Alyssa now holds the distinction of being a solo mission solver. She,
  Shiny New Bev and Old But Stronger Bev are the only three people who can
  complete this mission by themselves.

  Alyssa Ogawa + Important Artifact played as Equipment:
  If someone tries to nullify an "equipment artifact" that you have by using
  Disruptor Overload, (and I HAVE had this happen in tournaments, so stop
  laughing at me) just have Alyssa download a Medical Kit and at least
  give yourself a fifty-fifty chance of keeping the thing.

  Alyssa Ogawa (FC) + Alyssa Ogawa (Basic) + Assign Mission Specialists:
  Weak as she is, Basic Alyssa is now a mission specialist, so just use the
  Assign Mission Specialists objective (of which there is, it seems, about
  6,000,000 in every deck) to quickly get her out, and just persona replace FC
  Alyssa into play later, thus avoiding using a card play just for her. Also,
  if you find yourself in a position in which you only need Biology for a
  mission, Basic Alyssa can fill in nicely and score an extra five points.

  This card lets your synthetic personnel take out one adversary and then

  Rogue Borg get very rude with Lore in play. You'll only stun those
  Borg Defense drones without help from this interrupt.

  What deck will you play against that doesn't have a Soong-Type android,
  hologram, Borg drone or a Rogue Borg or two? If you have androids in your
  deck, this interrupt maximizes your combat effectiveness.

  Borg Kiss is icing on the cake for the Collective when assimilating your

  draws that Borg Kiss provides.

  Combos:

  Android Headlock + Antique Machine Gun + Vulcan Nerve Pinch:
  Take out a five-person Away Team as your lone android plugs two with the

  What better way to make powerful use of all those single-skilled characters

  that the pair of mission specialist represents the equivalent of a three-
  skilled personnel with double attributes. Plus, getting those extra 5 points

  30-point planet missions yield 35 ord 40 points).

  Although the focus of a mission specialist is on his or her single skill,
  don't forget to pay attention to the @{b}classification@{ub} as well. You might not
  need to download Alyssa Ogawa for her Biology, but how many times have you
  cooled your heels while waiting to draw that MEDICAL for protection from

  This is the most powerful card a Borg player can put in their deck.
  If you can pull off this objective against your non-Borg opponent's
  affiliation, you've basically locked them out of the game. Unless they've
  got Alternate Universe cards left in their deck, they are basically stuck
  with whatever they've been able to get out to that point. It's just as
  bad as having your outpost destroyed.

  You'll probably want to stock all three of the Homeworld missions
  (Espionage Mission, Expose Covert Supply, and Cloaked Mission), just
  because you never know for sure what affiliation your opponent will play.
  And of course, you'll need a Counterpart first, so be ready for
  battle. It can be a bit of effort, but the rewards are well worth it!

  Combos:

  Assimilate Homeworld + Locutus of Borg + He Will Make An Excellent Drone:
  Use Locutus to target Earth, score the 40 points, then convert him to a
  drone so you can go after your Klingon or Romulan opponent's homeworld, too.

  The Borg only assimilate planets with sufficient technological distinc-
  tiveness; in the gane, this is simulated by the 35-point threshold required
  by the Assimilate Planet objective. When playing a Borg planet-assimilation
  deck, you will of course want to seed some high-point planet missions -- but
  don't overlook your opponent's high-point missions. Assimilating his
  Hunt for DNA Program or Diplomatic Conference can put a real crimp in his
  strategy!

  As a non-Borg player, you may want to "Borg-proof" yourself a little bit
  by using planet missions worth fewer points. Anything worth 40 or more is

  Bring in Computer Skill on at least one of the four drones you beam in,

  This is a very powerful card for the Borg. You can play this at almost

  You also can download Defense Drones during battle. You'd want to hold
  this until your opponent attacks you. Then, you can download two
  Defense Drones, picking them as the situation warrants.

  Also, this is a great probe card for the Borg. This card will allow the

  by Jason Winter

  from @{"First Contact" link "STCCG:fc.guide/MAIN"}

  The effect of this dilemma is pretty straightforward: your opponent
  either uses a nice mixture of planet and space missions, or loses 50 points!

  Since players will want to avoid a "difference of 3 or more," under normal
  circumstances this means three missions of each type, or two of one type
  and four of another. Of course, specific cards such as Tarchannen Study
  and *Space can change this rule of thumb a bit. (If you're wondering whether
  Tarchannen Study dounts as both types or neither, it really doesn't matter.
  Either way, it doesn't affect the difference you compute.)

  Balancing Act affects both players, and thus you have great flexibility in
  where to seed it. The most conservative spot is under a mission you can
  attempt, perhaps near your outpost, so you can activate Balancing Act's
  effects whenever you like. If the mission belongs to you, you might fake
  out your opponent into thinking you just seeded an artifact. If the mission
  belongs to your opponent, that's one more seed card he has to worry about
  and, if you're lucky, he will do the work of activating the dilemma for
  you.

  Think of Balancing Act as an "insurance" card, and don't be too disappointed
  if it fails to make your opponent lose 50 points. It's still doing its
  primary job of making sure your other 18 dilemmas retain their potency.
  In fact, this card is working for you even when it's not in your deck.
  The mere threat of losing so many points can often scare your opponent
  away from an all-space or all-planet strategy.

  Combos:

  Balancing Act + two good planet combos + two good space combos +
  two good "either" combos:
  Either my dilemmas provide 100% coverage, or you lose big-time points.

  Balancing Act + Tox Uthat + Supernova:
  If you seeded a 4/2 mix, let's see if I can change it to 4-1. :-)

  Everyone knows that Beverly doesn't like EMH Programs. What surprises me

  First, Beverly retains all of her skills, and is still a super-MEDICAL

  first listed skill, so she'll be a great help in overcoming Tsiolkovsky
  Infection.

  One of her downloads is the Medical Tricorder, allowing personnel such

  can download the EMH. First, even if you download the EMH your total
  INTEGRITY and CUNNING still increase. Second, the dilemmas that
  target individual INTEGRITY and CUNNING are pretty much all planet-only
  ones, which the EMH can't help you with. Finally, if you don't use the EMH,

  Well, I guess I just have to write about this ;-) Decipher did a great job
  with making a crude graphical design into one of the most interesting cards
  in the game. By itself, the Black Hole is not that much of a threat to
  anything on the spaceline, although it can well complement a fast deck
  because a slower deck might run out of missions on the spaceline before it
  can get to 100 points. Just in this function, the Black Hole is an
  interesting addition to a deck if you have any fears about your opponent
  playing a stall deck that infinitely recycles its draw deck through
  Regenerates.

  But the true fun of the Black Hole comes through combos. What more fitting
  end for a loaded ship of your opponent than winding up in a Black hole
  (from your viewpoint of course ;-) ). However, this requires some setup.
  The cheap way is a Cytherians or Conundrum, but you can't time that to make
  absolutely sure your opponent's ship will have to stop at the Hole. A Blade
  of T'Kon does the trick, but the best combo involves two underused cards -
  Wormhole and Incoming Message. Tent for the appropriate Incoming Message
  and put a Hole on the spaceline.

  As soon as he moves his ship, play the Wormholes and follow it up with an
  Incoming Message. Of course your Wormhole will sling the ship to the other
  side of the Black Hole, exactly one RANGE of the ship away. He'll have
  to move and *SLURP* ;-)

  And here's another fiendish combo:

  In a battle of two slow decks, try Black Hole + Persistence of Memory +
  Lakanta or WNOHGB.
  You can still get to both ends of the line, but your opponent has a loooong

  Dilemmas have been characterized in the past as "killer," wall," or other

  "I am the Borg... I am the collective." Indeed, the Queen is
  more than just a cool personnel or a not-so-universal K'ChiQ. Her Majesty
  the Queen is the key to the Borg, replacing a whole handful of
  Interrupts and other cards. First, she can select every skill. And
  there is a whole lot of skills you might want to have. Empathy (Frame
  of Mind, Thought Fire), Diplomacy (Shaka), OFFICER (Maglock). All the
  typical kinds of skills you will not find in a drone. So why go out of
  your way to assimilate someone or play an Adapt: Negate Obstruction?

  Download two Borg Drones per turn with a little help from the

  returning the original objective to your hand for later use? Just make
  sure your Queen is safe aboard a cube and that you don't run into an
  untimely Barclay's Disease or Yuta. You might even seed and trigger a
  Yuta yourself early, just to be able to use those Adapt: Negate
  Obstruction cards later for her Majesty's protection. Oh, don't be
  afraid of stocking several Queens. With all the deck manipulation they
  also make excellent probe cards later. Three Queens in a 45-card
  draw deck is not overkill (that is if you have three... - but that's
  what trading is for ;-) )

  One of the obviouse good things about the Borg Queen is her ability
  to select any skill she wants. Combine this with Interlink Drone's
  skill sharing ability and your Borg can have a pretty good time!

  Some good combos:

  Queens Borg Cube + Borg Queen with SCIENCE + Interlink Drone +
  2x Eighteen of Nineteen + 3x Thirteen of Nineteen + Captain's Log +
  Metaphasic Shields =
  say hello to my 11-31-38 Borg Cube!!!

  Borg Queen with ENGINEER + Interlink Drone + any four drones =
  what was that about Theta Radiation Poisoning?

  Borg Queen with computer skill + Interlink Drone + assimilate
  starship + any poor scout with a blue subcommand icon =
  no need for any unecessary risks for your drones with computer skill

  Borg Queen with OFFICER + Interlink Drone + Eight of Nineteen =
  Maglocks? no problem!!!

  "That other" Borg ship is really quite useful (and almost as powerful
  as a Cube) if played correctly. This is the ship you want in your opening
  hand if you want to Retask a Cube. This is usually the limit that most
  players use this card, even though it can do much more.

  It can report with a crew to any spaceline end, so you can report it
  with four or five drones and start to Establish Gateways with quite a
  bit of success. Or, if the planet you want to assimilate is on the
  opposite side of the spaceline as  your Cube, report a Scout Vessel
  there and use the Transwarp Network Gateway it creates to move your Cube
  there. Also, you can use it to clear away dilemmas so your Cube can
  continue unharmed, or can leave it behind to probe while your Cube
  moves to your next target.

  Combos:

  Seeded Establish Gateway + Borg Ship + Borg Scout Vessel +
  any Navigation Drone + Retask:
  A good way of getting a fully staffed Cube in the Alpha Quadrant on your
  second turn.

  Borg Scout Vessel + any scouted mission with an incomplete Objective:
  Cytherians send your Cube on the scenic route? Report a Scout Vessel and

  A quick way to make your opponent meet a fate literally "worse than

  that will likely help your collective, your opponent won't be
  able to report that personnel while the new drone lives.

  Getting this to work isn't all that difficult, as Cybernetics is needed.
  Each affiliation only has one Cybernetics, plus there are two
  Non-Aligned ones (one of them being Dr. Soong). With so few available to

  Also, the MEDICAL can be taken care of with dilemmas like Tarellian

  @{b}@{u}Crystalline Entity@{ub}@{uu}
  by Neil Kirby aka Solok (nkirby@iquest.net)

  from the Basis Set

  If ever a card needed reappraising with all the recent changes this is
  it. Until recently, Crystalline Entity (CE) had 2 uses; binder
  fodder and an easy 5 points. Who sends an away team down without
  SCIENCE & MEDICAL (apart from me that is :( ), and how many ships are
  there with shields of 6 or less whose crews lack a musician? Not a
  lot. A sad comedown for a being that destroyed a colony and nearly
  destroyed the Enterprise.

  Now the arrival of Lore and a recent rule change give this card back some
  teeth. Firstly, Lore. Doubles the requirements needed to pass CE. So
  now your opponent needs to supply 2 SCI + 2 MED to get past it. Still
  quite plausible, but might be useful with a filter like Blended (to get
  rid of Spock), and a selective killer like Yuta to precede it.
  Nice, but not stunning.

  In space however, the recent ruling that you must attempt a mission from
  a ship really boosts this card's potential. Without shield enhancers
  of some description (Captain?s Log, Metaphasic Shields etc), only Borg
  cubes have the capacity to resist this dilemma; even the mighty
  Husnock ship ends up as toast as its shields are "only" 12 (and outpost
  shields won't save you here as it's not a ship-ship battle). So you can
  seed it at a space mission and be reasonably confident of it hitting
  your opponent hard. To add a bit of spice to the card, toss in a
  Shipwreck. Shield enhancers? What shield enhancers? And the shipboard
  barbers shop quartet? Precede the Entity with Ooby Dooby - unless all
  his crew have suddenly become musical, he's got problems. And what
  if they survive all this? Well, they still only get 5 points and a great
  deal of angst.

  So take out your Crystalline Entities, dust them off, and let
  Lore play! You know your opponent will thank you for it.

  Combinations:

  Ooby Dooby + Crystalline Entity + Lore + Space Mission:
  I thought your Husnock ship was tough

  Ooby Dooby + Crystalline Entity + Lore + Space Mission + Shipwreck:

  from @{"First Contact" link "STCCG:fc.guide/MAIN"}

  No ship in the STCCG universe has as much flexibility as the Darmok, one
  of the twenty black border cards found in the Star Trek Official Tournament
  Sealed Deck. When reporting for duty, you get to choose one of three special
  equipment functions - a Tractor Beam, Holodeck or Particle Scattering Device.

  What this means for sealed deck play is now you can match a ship's function
  to the cards you get in your sealed deck booster packs. Got a lot of
  holograms? Now you have at least one ship with holodeck capabilities so you
  can use them. Need to tow a Radioactive Garbage Scow? No problem, give your
  ship the tractor beam, and you can move it away. Or if you happen to get a
  Particle Scattering Field Event card, the Darmok can cause your opponent
  lots of beaming headaches. Or just give the ship the Particle Scattering
  Device to make your opponent afraid to beam anywhere, just as a bluff! But
  remember, once you pick the special function at reporting, that's what the
  ship will have for the rest of the game, so choose wisely.

  In standard Star Trek Swiss tournaments, and in casual play, several copies
  of the Darmok can make a really nasty Particle Scattering Field deck. In
  addition, as a stand-alone card, this ship is easy to staff and has
  respectable RANGE, WEAPONS and SHIELDS numbers.

  Darmok and Particle Scattering Field
  Darmok and Hologram characters

  Compared to premiere Data, this version has slightly lower INTEGRITY (due
  to that emotion chip causing him to hesitate once in awhile and the fact
  that he considered joining the Borg for 0.68 seconds). He also has the
  Enterprise-E icon, lacks Music skill and is a nemesis of Lore -- each of
  which can be an asset or a liability, depending on the situation. For
  example, the nemesis icon makes Data a target of Lore's uncontrollable
  aggression, but it also gives him the ability to deactivate his evil
  twin.

  So which version of Data do you want in your deck? How about both! Start
  out with premiere Data and wait for your opponent's Lore to make an
  appearance. Your premiere Data has no emotion chip and is safe from Lore's
  fury. But then you use the persona replacement rule to swap in First Contact

  @{b}@{u}Deactivation@{ub}@{uu}
  by Neil Kirby

  from @{"First Contact" link "STCCG:fc.guide/MAIN"}

  Another FC card with an array of "or's", but one with a variety of
  interesting uses that should find a lot of play, possibly becoming a
  staple in many decks, eh Sirna? Let's have a look at its uses...

  First up is (IMO) possibly the least valuable... nullifies Auto-Destruct
  Sequence (unless Fractal Encryption Code present). With the Borg attempting
  to assimilate starships left, right and centre, it becomes a bit more
  useful to destroy your ships, but it's still a rather rare occurrence in
  my somewhat limited experience, so it's ok but hardly spectacular.

  Second is nullifies Red Alert or Static Warp Bubble. Now we're talking!
  These cards already have their own specific counters in addition
  to the general Kevin Uxbridge route, but one card that can get rid of both
  of these annoying cards (annoying when played by your opponent at least) is
  really handy. What's more Deactivation is an Interrupt, so doesn't cost you
  that precious card play on your turn, and is immune to The Line Must Be Drawn
  Here. Better and better.

  Third is the ability to erase an away team of holographic personnel. Erase,
  note, not merely deactivate. Now here I could get a bit upset as I'm rather
  fond of using holograms as red-shirts, so another card that hits that
  strategy isn't good news. But it certainly should make us think twice about
  holo-exploitation so I'll be noble and say it's good for the game.

  Lastly are those two words at the end of the card - "Captain's Order". Aah,
  sweet. No more sweating when your opponent pops out his Red Alert because
  your Tent's closed and you don't know if Kevin Uxbridge is going to show up
  on time. Smile sweetly, play your Ready Room Door, and then *slowly* rummage
  through your draw deck for Deactivation, savouring the moment. Your Armada
  will be running a little late tonight I'm afraid, my friend.

  Deactivation - versatile & common. Don't leave spacedock without it!

  Wasn't it annoying? Your opponent would seed his Flute or Kurlan under
  an easy mission. Then, it's a race to get the necessary personnel for
  that mission, solve it, and then to use the extraordinary powers of the
  artifact to overwhelm you. With a Flute, all he did was report McKnights.
  With a Kurlan, it's off to find a Borg Ship. Same thing, same strategy,
  over and over.

  No more. If seeded wisely, this card can really cripple one-sided decks.
  Like other First Contact cards, this dilemma encourages a balanced deck.
  If the entire purpose of your opponent's deck is to solve Homeward
  and collect the Flute and nothing else, then this card will really
  throw a wrench into his game plan. With that mission shut out until
  your opponent likely solves two others, well, hope he has a backup
  plan...

  Remember, this card is unique, so only one may affect each player at
  once. Any duplicates encountered elsewhere while one is in play are
  immediately discarded. Remember this when you seed and when you begin to
  attempt missions.

  This is a very good choice for a Borg player, as it won't affect the
  Borg at all (they scout missions, not attempt them).

  Combos:

  The Sheliak + Dead End:
  Better get a move on if you really want those points from
  Espionage Mission...

  The Higher... The Fewer + Edo Probe + Dead End:

  Everyone can argue which bridge crew benefited and which ones didn't in
  First Contact, but I never heard anyone suggest that Deanna falls
  into the latter category. She keeps her Diplomacy and Empathy, but she
  also gains the skill of Navigation (which two other bridge crew lost).
  Her Diplomacy is still as useful as ever against dilemmas such as
  Cardassian Trap and Thought Fire.

  Perhaps her best skill is her ability to unstop her Away Team once
  per game. If a dilemma stops you, continue on. Mission Debriefing
  going to keep you from winning late in the game? Ignore it after
  completing a planet mission. Just led a raiding party on a Borg Cube?
  Beam off and get away before they can counterattack. Run into a
  Q/Sheliak? Beam up quickly!

  Combos:

  Deanna Troi + stopped Away Team:
  No matter how you get stopped, once per game you can unstop them all. Sort
  of like a mini Distortion of Space/Time Continuum built in.

  Deanna Troi + First Contact:
  She can complete a mission untargetable by the Borg all by herself. Plus,
  if you seed a Mirasta Yale underneath, it essentially turns into a 35-point

  Personnel battles became a much more important element of the game in

  One more of those Filter Dilemmas that allow you to stop a number of
  crew before hitting the remaining personnel with something truly nasty
  in order to hopefully eliminate them or at least get a turn. However,
  unlike the ones like Blended, this is pretty much tuned to stopping two
  affiliations (Federation and Klingon) and leaving all the others
  mostly unharmed.

  The Federation First Contact decks have to fear most from this card,
  especially if your Beverly is your only MEDICAL personnel. The Klingons
  might at least have one OFFICER with the high INTEGRITY while Romulans
  and Borg will often have no cards to match the description (the Borg
  could have Locutus, but you will usually want to have him continue to
  meet some nasty so you can eliminate him).

  Uses? Put this in front of a Shaka or Maglock to gain one turn by
  stopping that Diplomacy x2 Picard or Dathon. Throw it in with a few other
  Filters in the hope of stopping enough crew to get your Barclay's
  Disease or Nagilum to work. Or just gain a turn. If you put this under
  Wormhole Negotiations and keep a number of Treachery or Honor ready,
  you might quickly sneak in to get the mission while your opponent
  spends a turn getting his vital Diplomacy unstopped. A filter that
  works best in a mission stealer deck and of course as a Federation
  stopper. Not as effective as some of the other filters for general use.

  Seed Radioactive Garbage Scow first and then seed Edo Probe so it will

  fail when they get to the Garbage Scow and lose the 10 points.

  Another addition to this combo would be a Destroy Radioactive Garbage
  Scow as soon as they encounter the Garbage Scow. So even if they can
  complete the mission it is worth 10 less points.

  @{b}@{u}Edo Probe@{ub}@{uu} + Cytherians
  by Jason Winter : Q@decipher.com

  Seed the Cytherians first, so that the Edo Probe is revealed first.
  When the Edo Probe comes up, ask your opponent (in your best Jim
  Carrey voice) "Do you feel lucky? Huh?"

  If he does elect to continue, he'll hit the Cytherians and be forced to
  take off for the deepest reaches of space, which will trigger the Edo
  Probe and make him lose 10 points. Granted, he'll gain 15 when he
  completes the Cytherians, but the overall net gain is only 5 points.
  That's probably worth taking out one of your opponent's ships for several

  Affectionately known as "The Doctor" to Voyager fans is at first glance
  not a terribly useful card. Ah! But remember, the good Doctor came to
  the aid of Dr. Crusher, when threatened by the Borg. The E.M.H.
  Program has some negatives, like only having one per ship or outpost
  and not being able to join your Away Teams but he's still a MEDICAL with
  a fairly high Cunning rating. Plus, he's easily obtainable since Beverly
  Crusher can retrieve him as a "Special Download".

  My favorite use of the E.M.H. Program involves his very unique
  ability to "suspend play" as he is downloaded. Imagine this, you've
  already gotten the "Kurlan Naiskos" from your "Q's Planet". The Kurlan
  Naiskos TRIPLES your Weapons, Shields and Range when you have all
  seven Classifications on your ship. Pretty powerful in a "Borg Hunter"
  deck. Now, you're flying around when your Borg opponent asks "What's your
  power on the Enterprise-E?" Well, let's see, you have Weapons 13, plus
  an additional +3 for "Captain's Log" and another "+1" since Admiral Hayes
  is on board. That's a total of 17. Your opponent, thinking you easy
  prey with his 36 power Borg Cube plays "Eliminate Starship" as his
  Objective.

  You only have 6 of the needed 7 Classifications on board for the
  Kurlan Naiskos ("You left spacedock without MEDICAL???"). As he
  announces battle, you "suspend play" and download the E.M.H. Program to
  your ship. Now, your 17 Weapons Enterprise-E has weapons of 51,
  AFTER your opponent has already initiated battle. The Borg Weapons
  bounce harmlessly off your shields and they turn tail and run, easily

  This is the most basic objective for a Borg player - even more basic than
  its counterpart "Assimilate Planet", because you'll need it to complement
  any Retask strategy and, even more prominently, you can seed it - unlike
  the Assimilate Planet card.

  This card allows you to scout any space loaction for 25 points. Pretty
  basic and not much to it. It is usually easier to complete than a Planet
  where you can encounter nasties like Alien Parasites but it is also a bit
  riskier as you will to have to pit your entire crew against the Dilemmas
  your opponent has in store for you - and if it that is a Yuta, combined
  with Alas, Poor Queen, you just might be in trouble ;-)

  Mind also that, unlike Assimilate Planet, Establish Gateway is non-exclusive,
  giving your non-Borg opponent a free shot at a space mission potentially
  worth much more than 25 points after you took all the trouble to get
  through the Dilemmas.

  And a last pointer: Make sure you do have enough Transwarp Network Gateways
  in your deck when using Establish Gateway. As you have to download a Gateway
  upon completion, you will easily give your opponent a free peek at your
  entire strategy if you don't stock enough Gateways to satisfy these mandatory

  by Alidar Jarok

  from @{"First Contact" link "STCCG:fc.guide/MAIN"}

  A lot of new things happened with this card: Geordi got new eyes, so
  we get a new card. He helps staff the new Enterprise-E, plus he has a
  few new abilities.

  Geordi still maintains his super-ENGINEER status, and retains
  his Computer Skill and Physics. He does, however, replace his
  Navigation for Leadership. This doesn't pose too much of a problem,
  as the Feds have three Navigation x2 personnel at their disposal, plus
  Deanna gained the skill too. The Leadership is useful in a variety of
  ways and gives him a "planet" skill mixed in with his "space" ones.
  Finally, he can now download Optical Implants, which can help keep your
  crew safe.

  Combos:

  Geordi LaForge + Optical Implants:
  Look at that first dilemma under the planet mission - can it kill you?
  Better formulate an Away Team to make sure it can't.

  Geordi LaForge + Optical Implants:
  So, a bunch of Borg are stopped on a planet due to hitting a wall while
  scouting. Think you have a good chance of killing them off? Use
  Geordi to figure out exactly what your chances are.

  Geordi LaForge + Nutational Shields:
  An added margin of safety with the Borg roaming around now. On many
  Federation ships, this will result in damage due to a Cube, not
  destruction. Add a Scotty, Brahms, and Cochrane in your deck too, and
  non-Borg ships will be forced to build up a force to challenge your ship.

  Use this Dilemma if you are playing as Federation. This way, after your

  then attacks you, you can cancel it. Since the Federation can't normally
  attack anyway, if you later try to complete the mission, your opponent's

  Back in the early days of STCCG, the Federation was known for one thing -
  speed. More skills, faster ships, more missions you could do with a single
  personnel. Now speed is back. Less prominent, a bit less obvious, but it is
  there. Hawk alone turns FGC-47 into an inverse Warped Space with the 3 point
  Span advantage. Add Study Nebula and maybe a universal Nebula or two and
  suddenly the trip will be much shorter for you than for your opponent.
  Which also makes a "Hawked" Runabout with a Plasmadyne (Range 9!) an ideal
  vessel for a quick 15-point sidetrip with the Cytherian Travel Agency:-)

  Unfortunately there is no mission requirement of Navigation on a Nebula yet,
  but you can always add one if you want to give Hawk some extra room for
  creative skill use - the occasional Null Space turns into 5 free points
  wherever you can grab them. Well, let's see what Nebulae the future has to
  give us. I'm sure with Tuvok and Hawk (Nebula Dream Team), there is a lot of
  nebulous fun at the galactic Event Horizon. Now if there only were a few
  nebulous planets for balancing purposes...

  Oh, Hawk is also a very good complement for the Ooby Dooby Disco Kids crew -
  these kids love playing around at Nebulae, skill-wise!

  Besides its old uses (helping the Telepathic Alien Kidnappers is my

  on probing! There's no more guesswork involved -- you can see
  your probe card before you probe. If you don't like it, try to download
  something first, necessitating a reshuffle.

  Combos:

  Heisenberg Compensators + probing -

  know what card types are going into your opponent's hand so you can
  remove them.

  Heisenberg Compensators + Telepathic Alien Kidnappers + Static Warp Bubble -
  The Static Warp Bubble, if not nullified, eventually gets your opponent
  down to one use-it-or-lose-it card which he draws at the end of each turn
  and must play by the end of his next turn, or it will be discarded. But
  with Heisenberg Compensators, you know what the card is, and with

  from @{"Sealed Deck" link "STCCG:sealeddeck.guide/MAIN"}

  So what's a Q-Continuum card doing in the Star Trek Official Tournament
  Sealed Deck? Quite a bit, actually. What you are seeing is the second
  dual-type card. This Q-Dilemma/Event gives you a lot of flexibility in a
  sealed-deck environment and breathes new life into the Q Continuum side
  deck of your regular tournament deck.

  In a sealed-deck environment, you'll probably be taking advantage of the
  dilemma half of this card, since it can be seeded like a regular dilemma.
  Very simply, it gives you the ability to stop some or all of your opponent's
  Away Team members, limiting her chance of successfully completing that
  mission this turn.

  Outside the Sealed Deck tournament, this card also becomes a valuable
  weapon in the war on Q "bypass" strategies. The first option you have is
  to place this card on the table as a Hidden Agenda event. Although this
  takes up a seed slot, you have the flexibility to use it at any time.

  Have you been looking for a new reason to incorporate a Q-Continuum side
  deck? Throw a couple of copies of this card in your Continuum to back up
  the one you seeded as a Hidden Agenda. This way during a game, you can use
  the seeded copy to stop your opponent's first attempt at Q bypass. That
  copy of Hide and Seek will be discarded, but that's where the backups in
  your side deck come in! By the time your opponent attempts Q bypass at a
  different mission, chances are another copy of Hide and Seek will have
  come up from your Continuum. If the extras come up more often than you need
  them, or if your opponent isn't playing a Q bypass strategy, you can always
  choose to have the extra copies function as dilemmas.

  Combos:

  Hide And Seek + Sealed Deck Environment =
  An effective dilemma to slow down your opponent.

  Hide And Seek + Q Flash =
  Flexibility in accessing either text of the card. Pull out those Q Flashes!

  Hide And Seek + Hidden Agenda option =
  Use it as a safety net in case your opponent tries to bypass the dilemmas
  via Q.

  Not quite. The Iconian Gateway can be a nice way to get around, but
  it's a one-way trip. Once you've sent your people through to another

  Here's an interesting way to play with no ships. Seed your Iconian
  Gateway under Risa Shore Leave, and place your outpost there. After
  completing the mission, play the gateway on Risa and send male
  redshirts through to other planets to eliminate the dilemmas. When one
  happens to survive, bring him back to Risa with Jamaharon, and use him
  again elsewhere.

  This strategy combines well with missions that can be completed with1
  one personnel, i.e. Troi (or Rakal) and First Contact, Bev Crusher and
  Evaluate Terraforming, Rachel Garrett and Restore Errant Moon,
  Data and Investigate Time Continuum. Colonies are also highly
  recommended.

  It takes some effort, but it's ideal against an opponent who consistently

  Granted, Cloaked Mission is a Klingon mission, so this could cause

  so important to many Federation decks. As the captain of the
  Enterprise-E, he can be downloaded through the Ready Room Door to staff

  So, pictured we have a young woman who looks like she could use a tissue,

  Kathleen Tonell's arrival on the STCCG scene is very timely for a number
  of reasons. Her one skill, anthropology, has always been handy but rarely
  critical, but the advent of FC changes that picture somewhat. First reason -
  Primitive Culture, with its gazillion "OR"'s but few really good ways to
  get past it. The easiest....CIVILIAN + Anthropology - hey she fits! She's
  also handy with Worshippers that seem to be crawling out of the binders
  again now that Balancing Act ensures that you'll have a place to seed it.
  Well, there are other ways of getting those skills, the best being IMO
  Madam Guinan or the affiliated Anthropologists. But here Kathleen's
  limitations actually help you out - she only has this one skill.......
  mission specialist no less. Hence she comes when called, no tenting to
  find her or praying for a good draw.

  Who does that help most? Well, the Feds have Darian Wallace who is
  similarly gifted in AMS terms, so her main benefit is for the Romulans
  (especially, with the Klingons following close behind.

  Finally, Engage Shuttle Operations becomes much easier to get into

  Vulcan Lander isn't completely reliable due to Montana Missile
  Complex, so shuttles would be a good backup. Also, don't let Barclay's
  Transporter Phobia or atmospheric disturbances stop you; just don't
  beam down! With Launch Portal, Engage Shuttle Operations can now
  affect scout ships as well, giving the Borg and Romulans better ships
  to land than shuttles.

  Another aspect of Launch Portal is that you can use it to escape from a
  doomed ship. In an instant, you can download Engage Shuttle Operations
  (or Escape Pod), a download a scout, shuttle, or Sphere, and launch the
  ship with the crew. If your Bortas is taken out by a fleet while on its

  This card is also a good Borg stopper, because the Borg are *very* short

  Here's a card both Borg and non-Borg players can agree on. Non-Borg

  can Regenerate them later. Not to mention it's great when a Drone is
  running back to their ship with their freshly abducted Counterpart
  target. Play Mercy Kill to kill the just-abducted prospect, saving him
  and nullifying the Borg's Assimilate Counterpart objective.

  For the Borg, this card has probe rigging written all over it. Stock
  Zalkonian Storage Capsules, and load them with cards that have the icons
  you need for your probes. Just before you probe for your objective,
  Mercy Kill your Capsule, and choose to put the cards stored there on top

  After reflecting (Ha ha!) upon it for a while, I have concluded that
  Mirror Image is actually a very interesting little card. It really
  isn't something that would be very useful as far as advancing a strategy,
  but it is very helpful as an "emergency counter". The fact that you may
  seed it gives you the choice of forfeiting a dilemma slot, allowing your
  opponent to easily complete that last mission that he needs to...wait!
  That's not what I meant! What I meant to say was that seeding it allows
  you to have it ready instead of hoping that, by sheer luck, you will somehow
  get it into your hand despite the fact that because you need it, it is the
  exact last card in your deck. Once you have it out, though, there are
  a few neat things that you can do with it:

  Combos:

  Mirror Image + Opponent's Red Alert/Kivas/Traveler/Masaka -
  This is the card's basic use. A warning, though: some players hate it when
  you turn their own cards against them, so always keep this polite and
  civilized response handy for when they yell at you: "That sure wasn't MY
  card. It's your own darn fault."

  Mirror Image + Traveler/Kivas + Opponent's Persistence of Memory -
  Your opponent will quickly find that, because The Traveler and Kivas Fajo
  now count for all players, he just wasted an Artifact. Resist the urge to
  mention this to him often.

  Mirror Image + Traveler/Kivas + A Lead That You Are In Danger Of Losing -
  The new rules state that games do not end until BOTH players' decks run out.
  If you have a small lead that you would like to keep, help both decks
  dwindle by using these cards to cause both players to run out their decks
  quickly.

  In closing, I would just like to say this:

  I wasn't too impressed with this dilemma at first, but now I'm really

  opponent's discarding a card when this is encountered, which in some
  cases is more important than killing a random personnel. But no matter
  what the result of the probe is, one personnel won't be continuing the
  mission for at least the remainder of the turn.

  This card gives you a built-in, reusable mini-Full Planet Scan,
  coupled with the opportunity to scope out your opponent's Away Team.
  Though Geordi seems a fitting target for the event, it's usable by all
  affiliations with either a universal Soong-type Android or any Borg.

  Not sure if you want to attack that Away Team? Have your enhanced
  personnel check for STRENGTH-enhancing equipment or
  drones first. (And don't forget that his intruders on your ship also
  constitute an Away Team.) Or maybe you know the next dilemma he will
  encounter is Yuta, and you want to refresh your memory for a couple of
  key Yuta numbers. On a ship you could play a Long-Range Scan, but
  there is no equivalent for a planet mission (except as a side effect of
  Brain Drain). Scan the cards with Ocular Implants, and Amanda can't
  touch it.

  The major use is likely to be for glancing at the bottom seed card
  under a planet mission. It can speed up your mission attempt by a turn if
  it alerts you to a wall dilemma that you can overcome with the right mix
  of personnel, or avert disaster by warning you off from a Sheliak or
  Alien Parasites. Seed your artifact first, because it won't do you much
  good to have it on the bottom, blocking you from seeing the first
  dilemma. Also keep in mind that an unpassed wall dilemma is replaced
  under the mission, so on your next turn you still won't be able to see
  what comes next.

  This is one of those Dilemmas you can use against your opponent or, for
  good measure, to help yourself. Against your Flute-happy adversary it will
  just be devastating, not only through the filter effect that will neatly
  split his crew, but also through the sudden loss of most of his hand. This

  Probably the best-known strategy for this card is to eliminate bad card
  draws, but there are two other ways to use it. First, use it to control
  probes. Second, use it to move the top card of your draw deck to the
  bottom, draw a different card, then use Remodulation to get the card you

  by Bochra

  from the Basis Set

  Pattern Enhancers is often called a useless card, but it can be the key
  in any planet occupying deck. The surprise is when working this card
  together with Atmospheric Ionization to your own advantage.

  Placing Atmospheric Ionization on your opponent's planet mission would
  not only slow his deck down, it would control the number of his
  personnel on the planet. This means that with Pattern Enhancers in play,
  you can outnumber not only your opponent's team, but his
  reinforcements too. So beam down with your high-strength personnel
  with insane attribute modifiers and blast his team away. With the new
  battle rules, you actually have a chance at wiping him completely off
  the surface. And if something goes terribly wrong, with Pattern
  Enhancers your large team can make a quick getaway.

  Combos:

  Pattern Enhancers + your opponent's planets covered with Atmospheric
  Ionization -
  For the daring, go for total occupation. Drop off a force at every planet,
  totally blockading them off.

  Pattern Enhancers + Distortion Field overlaps -
  Block off important missions and steal them at your leisure.

  from @{"First Contact" link "STCCG:fc.guide/MAIN"}

  We only saw Paul Porter in the First Contact for a few moments, and he
  was the first to meet his demise with the Borg. With such a small
  part, one might think that he would be a prime candidate to be a
  single-skilled mission specialist. Paul's card reveals much more of his
  story.

  Paul is senior systems ENGINEER on the Enterprise-E and has a command
  icon. This can be useful for staffing a variety of ships, and he
  can staff the Bozeman on his own. Paul also has three skills --
  geology, physics, and computer skill -- as well as the ability to
  download any PADD.

  With a little help in boosting an away team's attributes, Paul is
  instrumental in completing a variety of missions, including Sensitive
  Search (download a PADD to help with cunning), Survey Instability, and
  Test Mission. Paul's special download ability could also be
  useful if you get trapped by Samaritan Snare/Lack of Preparation
  combo. Just use Paul's download icon to get a PADD and you have the
  ENGINEER and the equipment.

  With attributes of INTEGRITY 7, CUNNING 6, and STRENGTH 6, Paul is
  fairly average for Starfleet. An INTEGRITY of 7 is strong and
  comparable with other Federation personnel. His cunning can be
  boosted by downloading the PADD. A strength of 6 may seem mediocre, but
  compared with many other Federation ENGINEERs, he stands a better chance
  than most others of surviving a personnel battle. Combos:

  Paul Porter + Federation PADD + Sensitive Search

  Paul Porter + Rager + Montgomery Scott + Explore Dyson Sphere -
  Score 40 points with three personnel (Rager has a 5 pt. bonus with this
  mission).

  Paul Porter + opponent's Samaritan Snare -
  The Federation must attempt Samaritan Snare if they stop at that
  location. Use Paul's game text to download a PADD for equipment
  discard and complete the mission.

  One of the neater toys in the Fajo Collection, this interesting little
  piece of artwork lets you mess with your opponent's mind, and cards.
  And trust me - the memory of that *will* persist. :)

  While the artifact doesn't do much on its own, it does reverse ten of
  the most common and/or powerful cards you'll see in the game. You can
  warp your own cards, but of course, it's much more fun to watch your
  opponent's face when that card ends up being more trouble than it's
  worth..

  Want card advantage? Turn your opponent's Static Warp Bubble,
  Kivas Fajo - Collector, or Traveler against him. Black Hole sucking your
  missions away? No problem - now it spits out Space locations. And heck,
  he didn't need the double turns from that Horga'hn, did he?
  (They're much more useful to you, anyways.) And those Devidian Doors don't
  quite work as expected, when he has to pick up his personnel, and
  *still* show the Door..

  But this doesn't even touch the truly fun uses. The Supernova with
  Persistence restores the mission - but *only* the mission. No pesky
  dilemmas or Q-Flashes to tie up your Away Team. And the reversed
  Anti-Time Anomaly becomes a mass Devidian Door for all your dead
  personnel, regardless of duplication - perfect for replenishing that
  Away Team. Or, suffering from bad shuffle? Persistence your own Thought
  Maker, and you get to give yourself whatever cards you want, in the order

  from @{"First Contact" link "STCCG:fc.guide/MAIN"}

  With 7 OR's, this classic wall dilemma presents more ways to get past it
  than any other. The catch is that almost every one is affiliation-specific,
  and two can't be used yet at all. Vorta and 4 Jem'Hadar clearly is the
  method of choice for the yet-unseen Dominion affiliation, while 2 Obsidian
  Order must wait for the likes of Elim Garak and Enabran Tain to appear.
  6 Klingons or 4 [Def] Borg are about as specific as you can get; even the
  Federation can't muster that many Klingons. But while any 6 Klingons will do,
  or any 4 [Def] Borg, the Romulans can barely pass this with their present
  total complement of 2 Tal Shiar.

  The remaning three sets of conditions present multi-affiliation possibilities,
  however. While Acquisition and 2 Greed is obviously the key Ferengi option,
  the non-aligned Kivas Fajo can pass this dilemma singlehandedly. 3 Vulcans
  will be easiest for the Federation, but Tallera, T'Shonra, Solkar, and
  Sevek are all non-aligned and may be used by any non-Borg affiliation.
  And finally, it is possible for any affiliation (except perhaps Borg) to
  come up with Anthropology and CIVILIAN.

  Combos:
  Primitive Culture + The Higher...The Fewer + Cardassian Trap:
  Drain your opponent of a few points, then trap one of his personnel. There's
  an excellent chance of at least one of the Away Team being unique (except
  for Borg, in which case the Trap becomes another wall dilemma). If you're
  worried about Empathy (escpecially against Romulans), throw in Empathic Echo
  before the Trap.

  Primitive Culture + Bendii Syndrome + Alien Parasites:
  With Vulcans available for everyone, you have a good chance of lowering
  the AT's INEGRITY enough to trigger an Alien Parasites infestation. Or,
  if your opponent uses Kivas Fajo to pass Primitive Culture, his utter lack
  of INTEGRITY will be no help at all. And a Romulan Away Team with Major

  Borg Spheres aren't given the credit they deserve, and this one deserves

  Research). Also, this ship helps you download two good cards: the Borg
  Queen with Ready Room Door and Temporal Vortex, which is useful if
  you want to disrupt the timeline.

  Not only this, but the Sphere can help greatly during scouting. Launch
  it before scouting to clear away dilemmas for your Cube. Or, send it
  to Establish a Gateway at a space location that your opponent already
  solved while your Cube moves into position to assimilate its next
  target. Also, after your Cube clears away the dilemmas on any location,
  leave the Sphere there to probe while your Cube again heads off
  towards its next "objective".

  Combos:

  A Retasked Cube + Queen's Borg Sphere + Ready Room Door + Borg Queen:

  Quadrant with a Queen on board on your third turn.

  a little more effort to get into play than any other affiliation. What
  if you could get a FULLY STAFFED Borg cube on the spaceline in your
  second turn? It's actually very easy with Retask. Retask takes the
  Borg Ship dilemma, a card that has been a staple for space decks since
  Premiere was released, and allows you to replace it, by downloading a
  Cube, with a staff of seven Borg to fly it. The Borg Ship dilemma is
  discarded, and you now have a fully controllable Borg Cube to do with as
  you wish. Best of all, you can get this out quickly:

  1. Seed the Borg Ship dilemma under a space mission closest to the end of
     the spaceline. Make sure you can seed this last, so it's the first to be
     revealed.

  2. Report a Borg Scout Vessel and a nav drone to the end of the spaceline,
     moving to the Borg Ship dilemma seeded mission if necessary.

  3. Have "Establish Gateway" as your starting Objective. Scout the location
     and reveal the Borg Ship dilemma. Your Scout will be destroyed
     immediately, but that's ok.

  4. Q-Tent a "Retask" and get it on your next turn. Play "Retask" and you've
     traded 1 Scout and 1 nav drone for a fully stocked cube, all in two turns
     if you get the right draw!!

  By the way, "Retasking" a Borg Ship dilemma is also a very nasty surprise

  from @{"Alternate Universe" link "STCCG:au.guide/MAIN"}

  A little while back, I saw a couple of card extras posted listing a fun
  way to use this card in a defensive fashion -- preventing your
  opponent's Borg-hunting deck from encountering any Borg.

  Good tip. However, I use this card in what I consider to be a much more
  powerful fashion. It is particularly useful in Federation decks at the
  moment, but if the first glimpse at the Fajo Collection is any
  indicator, we're going to be seeing more and more double classification
  personnel soon, which should make this card more useful to all and any
  affiliations.

  To me, Senior Staff Meeting is the ultimate dilemma combo-breaker. If
  you negate your opponent's Tarellian Plague Ship, his Barclay's
  Protomorphosis disease is probably passable now, isn't it? And I've
  found lots of people who haven't built their decks to face ones that
  use no planet missions; therefore, they rely a bit too heavily on their
  Borg Ships, usually just seeding the one Borg as the only dilemma at a
  mission. They're none too pleased when I Senior Staff Meeting it away
  to their discard pile and complete the mission with a handful of
  personnel, completely unhindered by dilemmas.

  Senior Staff Meeting allows me to do two big things in my deck. First, it
  lets me run the entire deck with a bare minimum of personnel. By
  keeping them alive, I get more use out of the ones I have, keeping
  spares in my Q's Tent just in case. This also allows me to fill my draw
  deck out with other fun cards. Additionally, Senior Staff Meeting
  makes my deck move much faster. Once I have one personnel of each
  classification down, I board a ship and go, happily SSM'ing away the
  first dilemma at any missions I decide to attempt.

  No, this strategy is not foolproof. Nothing is. But nothing can compare
  to the look on your opponent's face when you break up his big dilemma
  combo, or nullify the Borg Ship he had seeded first under a space
  mission.

  @{b}@{u}Senior Staff Meeting@{ub}@{uu}
  by Evan "Mot the Barber" Lorentz : evanl@earthlink.net

  Using the Kurlan Naiskos in Borg-hunting decks seems to be all
  the rage right now. Well, you can throw a nasty little wrench into
  that strategy using the Senior Staff Meeting. Wait until the opponent has
  obtained and played their Naiskos and moved toward a mission where
  they've seeded a Borg Ship they intend to destroy. Just before they
  attempt the mission to unleash the Borg, play a Senior Staff Meeting on
  their ship! They'll have all the necessary classifications present
  (they have to for the Naiskos). You graciously rid them of the first
  dilemma -- their seeded Borg Ship. Not only do you deny them the 45
  points they'd been counting on, but you then force them to face dilemmas
  they probably haven't built their decks to handle!

  @{b}@{u}Senior Staff Meeting@{ub}@{uu}
  by Bill Rinner : COLORADORIN@worldnet.att.net

  I recently participated in a tournament where the two things that
  kept me from winning, were Borg ship killing decks. After my frustrating
  defeat, I searched through my cards and found a way to stop those
  annoying Kurlan Naiskos/Borg Ship decks (besides Kevin Uxbridge).

  Now usually, your opponent will seed the Borg ship dilemma after you have
  seeded your dilemmas at their missions, so they don't have to face
  all of those killer dilemmas you have waiting for them. So, just
  before they attempt the mission with their Kurlan Naiskos enhanced ship,
  play Senior Staff Meeting to force them to discard the first dilemma
  seeded at the mission: Borg Ship!

  So long, 45 points! Hello killer dilemmas! Another addition to this
  combo would be a Destroy Radioactive Garbage Scow as soon as they
  encounter the Garbage Scow. So even if they can complete the mission it
  is worth 10 less points.

  count as a normal card play you can get even more personnel in play with
  Sense the Borg. A popular strategy is to play a Rogue Borg Mercenary on your
  opponent's ship to stop them from executing orders. When you play a RBM,
  then play Sense the Borg in response to download Ready Room Door which when
  played allows you to download Assign Mission Specialists which allows you to
  download two mission specialists. Stopping your opponent AND getting two
  personnel in play, not that bad!

  Combos:

  Rogue Borg Mercenary + Sense the Borg + Ready Room Door +
  Assign Mission Specialists + two mission specialist personnel.

  @{b}@{u}Sense The Borg@{ub}@{uu}
  by Alidar Jarok

  This card, in effect, lets you download dozens of cards. In addition to the
  first three cards listed, Ready Room Door will let you download ships'
  captains or Captain's Order cards. One Captain's Order card is Assign Mission
  Specialists, which lets you download any two mission specialists, and there
  are quite a few of them in the game. All those cards to download, and it
  doesn't even count as your card play! And remember, the new Jean-Luc Picard
  can download this card.

  The catch is that something Borg-related has to enter play. However, it
  doesn't have to be your opponent's Borg. So if you're playing Borg, you can
  use this card to report the Queen to her Cube as soon as you play the
  Queen's Borg Cube. Or, you can play a Rogue Borg to stop your opponent's
  ship, and play Sense The Borg to download one of many cards - use one stone
  to kill two birds!

  Combos:

  Sense The Borg + Queen's Borg Cube (or Sphere):
  As soon as you play the ship, use Sense The Borg to download Ready Room Door,
  hence downloading the Borg Queen. Now it's time to take over the Alpha
  Quadrant!

  Opponent's Lore + Opponent's Rogue Borg Mercenaries + FC Jean-Luc Picard:
  So, your opponent played about 6 Rogue Borg on your Enterprise-E. Use Picard
  to download Sense The Borg, and use that to download Hugh.

  Perhaps his best use is to command the Vulcan Lander and go

  This is definitely one of my favorite cards in the game. For one
  turn, every ship enhancement is nullified. Because of this fact,
  this card should find its way into every Borg deck. The biggest threat
  to the Mammon Machines that we call "Borg Cubes" are Kurlaned ships.
  Just let them come up and attack you. Respond to their battle by
  playing Shipwreck and send the Enterprise-E to the discard pile.
  The hunted turned into the hunter faster then you can say "Interrupt!"
  (Well, exactly that fast, actually.)

  The other use, though less powerful, can come in handy on occasion.
  Nullifying the attribute enhancements of all the Enterprises
  in play will be more useful for non-Borg players. However, being
  able to cancel a download of an Enterprise can disrupt the speed of
  a Federation deck.

  Combos:

  Shipwreck + Borg-hunting Federation fleet:
  Suddenly, the tough little Bozeman's only 5-8-7, and the Enterprise-E
  is a "measly" 10-9-10. Unfortunately, your Cube is suddenly downgraded
  to 8-24-24.

  Shipwreck + Borg Ship:
  What if you're not playing Borg when your opponent goes Borg hunting?
  That's not going to stop him. Make him regret he ever seeded that card...

  I have found this to be one of the most effective dilemmas from the

  If your opponent is playing a SECURITY or OFFICER android, then
  you get to filter them out on their way to the next dilemma. This will
  remove among the highest CUNNING, highest STRENGTH personnel in that
  Team. (And unless we're talking Lore, among the higher INTEGRITY, as
  well.)

  If your opponent isn't playing the right androids, then they're in big
  trouble. You can take your pick of the Team. And this will not stop
  them, which means they have to move on and face your next dilemma. It's
  the best of both worlds!

  Combos:

  Abduct Dr. Soong, then kill off an android... or if those guys aren't

  by Decipher

  from @{"Sealed Deck" link "STCCG:sealeddeck.guide/MAIN"}

  This doorway, like the Alternate Universe Door, meets your basic need for a
  way to play AU-icon cards. In sealed-deck play, this helps you make the best
  use of your Alternate Universe booster pack and ensures that all of your
  AU dilemmas are seedable. (And if you pull a heavy hitter like Major Rakal
  or Jack Crusher, so much the better!) Although the Space-Time Portal allows
  you to play only one AU-icon card per turn, in a typical sealed-deck
  environment this doesn't usually hinder you at all.

  In regular play, the ability to move an entire ship with crew from your hand
  to the spaceline, and vice versa, can be very powerful -- especially since
  you can do it during your opponent's turn and at any spaceline (or timeline)
  location. Save up enough crew in hand to staff a scary AU ship like the
  Decius, then wait for your opponent to stray from his outpost and pay him an
  unexpected visit.

  Which doorway to choose? Well, if you plan on playing more than one AU card
  per turn (perhaps you have lots of AU interrupts, or AU personnel with Red
  Alert!), go with the Alternate Universe Door. But if you don't mind the
  one-per-turn limitation, choose the Space-Time Portal and enjoy the extra
  benefits and protections it gives you. Or better still, seed *both* doorways
  at the beginning of the game; your Space-Time Portal will be ready for
  immediate discarding whenever you need it, and your AU Door will still be
  there to let your AU-icon cards enter play.

  Combos:

  Space-Time Portal + downloaded Alternate Universe Door -
  Ah, I see you have a PNZ deck. How about if I nullify your Temporal Rift
  on *your* turn?

  Space-Time Portal + Devidian Foragers -
  Get a hefty boost to the STRENGTH of one of your AU personnel just before
  you initiate a personnel battle.

  An upgraded version of the standard Starfleet Phaser granting you a +3
  on STRENGTH instead of the usual +2, but at the price of the loss of some
  Diplomacy skill as soon as you get off your ship and start tackling
  some planet missions.

  Of course this is a decent defense weapon against a Borg player.
  Several smart Borg users build decks centered around assimilating planets
  and establishing gateways but then add some excuses to battle your crew
  in the form of an Assimilate Counterpart objective. Here the
  phaser rifle comes in as a rather serious discouraging factor as it
  offsets one and a half Assault Drones.

  Plus, you can download one of these beauties as a little surprise to a
  less cautious opponent. Just keep Lightner around and make no effort
  to download the Phaser Rifle. Your opponent will probably assume you
  just have him around for Astrophysics (stock Study Plasma Streamer to
  maintain that illusion) and attack. Bam, +3 and thank you;-)

  Just make sure you leave this weapon aboard your ship during planetside
  mission attempts unless you are pretty sure you don't need Diplomacy
  or there is a really large risk your Borg opponent will come over and
  make short work of your Away Team should it get stopped.

  Of course there is a way to maintain some diplomatic presence even with a
  Phaser Rifle - Picard (Premiere), Dathon, Pardek (under Treaty
  conditions), Riva and Sarek retain at least a minimum diplomatic skill.
  However, except for Dathon and Sarek, they require two people to
  overcome a Shaka and this leaves you wide open to a Zaldan right after
  it, so make sure that if you pursue this way you have some Exobiology or
  Wesley Crusher handy to deal with this threat.

  My personal favorite dilemma in First Contact, this card is like an

  to choose them. Most of the time you'll take a Diplomacy personnel
  out of action, otherwise you'll likely get to choose any personnel
  in the crew to die.

  Since I noted that more often than not a Diplomacy personnel will die,
  it's best to set up combos that punish a lack of Diplomacy. However,
  dilemmas that need SECURITY can really harm the Borg, as the two
  Defense drones will usually be the only source of Borg SECURITY for
  your opponent's ship.

  Combos:

  Strict Dress Code + Barclay's Protomorphosis Disease:

  A card we all waited for - make those pesky counter decks go an
  extra mission or two. One of its best features is that it's
  cumulative. For the price of having three less Dilemmas you can make
  your opponent regret the very first counter with a minus 15. And this
  helps in quite a few places. Have a Borg deck relying on Retask ? Better
  stock and seed at least 4 of this card to make your opponent pay for
  the loss of a vital card. Afraid of a Q deck ? Play Goddess of Empathy
  and stock a few Q2s.

  If he doesn't play an Ux on the Goddess, you can safely leave your
  hidden agenda hidden and have fun with a Q2. If he does, well, make
  him pay for it. You will pay for your Q2s as well now, but you still
  won't be worse off than either getting even and eliminating his Q
  or draining him a net 15-25 (depending on the number of copies
  of this card you use) if he gets his Q. Either way, you've done some
  damage. (Another nasty no-win for your opponent is Sheliak/Q/The
  Line... x4 - either you munch his away team and hopefully outpost or
  he's paying 20 for a Q2.)

  Defence against this: none. However if you have a deck that can do 120
  points pretty easily, Ux some minor Event at the beginning, net the -20,
  wait until the countdown has expired, then counter away at will -
  this card is far more often seeded than played.

  This Doorway card has several beneficial functions for the Borg. Seeding
  this card establishes your Transwarp Network immediately. Your Borg ships
  could even move from the Delta Quadrant to the Alpha Quadrant on the first

  Furthermore, you may use additional copies of this doorway or the
  Transwarp Conduit interrupt throughout play to speedily move about the

  incedible mobility for the Borg. However, your opponent may potentially
  be able to sneak through... once in play your Transwarp Network can be
  used by your opponent by anticipating and stocking Transwarp Conduit
  interrupts in his or her deck.

  A second function gained by playing the doorway is flexibility in
  obtaining your Transwarp Conduit interrupts. Occasionally you may wish

  This is a cool speed tool for any Federation player and, somewhat
  unfortunately, a rich kid's toy due to the fact that its most powerful
  positive effect is amongst others triggered by the Fajo Collection
  icon.

  What the Memorial gives you is no less than free card draws or plays,
  and thus more speed to your deck. And with speed being the essential
  thing in winning the Star Trek Customizable Card Game (after all it
  is about getting 100 points before your opponent does), more speed
  means more winning chances. But as most things in life, Visit Cochrane
  Memorial doesn't come without a price. First, you need to build it,
  meaning you either need to seed Espionage Mission, a mission you
  cannot solve as a Federation player, or you must first have Zefram
  Cochrane in play. I'd usually rather go for the latter version, Zefram is
  a decent card and I don't give my Borg opponent a free homeworld to
  assimilate.

  Of course, any deck designed to make good use of the memorial can also
  use the First Contact Reg Barclay, doubling the output in terms of free
  card draws, card plays and even free downloads (Jokers - you get exactly
  the card you need. Get two or three of these early and watch your deck
  work!)

  Another risk is the occasional discard. Don't use too many
  non-aligned personnel and also don't even think of using Visit Cochrane
  Memorial with an Assign Mission Specialists deck - too many Ready
  Room Doors. Basically, if you're going pure Federation and don't have
  more than 10% non-aligned cards, you are fine.

  Oh, one more: The "Play a card" outcome is mandatory, so if your
  only playable card in hand is a Mercy Kill and your only Event on
  table is an un-mirrored Traveler you might want to skip that probe draw.

  Combine this with the Orb of Prophecy and Change to rig your

  Well, we've had cards that drain away a ship's RANGE (Birth of "Junior",
  Baryon Buildup) and WEAPONS (Anti-Matter Spread) for a while now. But
  there was nothing we could do about the Husnock Ship's 12 SHIELDS...
  until now.

  This card can really help a deck constructed around space battles to
  soar to new heights, and to accomplish its goal quicker than before.
  Though the 4 points taken off the SHIELDS seem rather insignificant,
  theay can aactually save you turns (and potential battle damage). And
  remember, shaving 4 WEAPONS off the requirement to damage a ship
  essentially translates to 8 off the requirement to destroy it. Not only
  that, but the second option of the game text can help you topple the
  mightiest of ships with only two average ships of your own.

  Combos:
  Two captained Warbirds + Captain's Log + Opponent's Borg Cube + Weak Spot:
  With the new Ready Room Door, you can download (and protect) Captain's Log,
  then dowload the ships' matching commanders quickly. Your two warbirds can
  now damage the Cube on their own with Weak Spot (as opposed to not even
  being able to damage it without it). Pull this off again before your
  opponent plays a Regenerate, and you'll bag yourself 45 points! Keep those
  Alas, Poor Queens handy!

  Two I.K.C. K'Vorts + Opponent's U.S.S. Enterprise + Weak Spot:
  Save yourself a turn! Without Weak Spot, the Enterprise-D would only be
  damaged, requiring you to do the same thin the next turn (unless your
  opponent foolishly counter-attacks on his turn). Just destroy him and
  move on to bigger and better things.

  T'Pau + Combat Vessel + Opponent's Kurlaned I.K.C. Bortas + Weak Spot:
  It is a sad day for the Romulan Empire, as the mighty Bortas is cruising
  the spaceline and hunting down the enemies of the Klingon Empire. But the
  measly T'Pau and Combat Vessel boldly stand up to the hostile giant, find
  its Weak Spot, and destroy it! Costs you one of your ships, but your
  opponent likely had all of his good mission-solving eggs in his seemingly
  invincible basket.

  The new Riker is one of the Bridge crew members who definitely gained
  from the revision. A second Leadership replaces Navigation, a
  skill you should never have a desperate lack of, considering
  Gibson who is a Navigation x2 mission specialist. On the other
  hand, the additional Leadership is a great asset in overcoming a pesky
  (or self-seeded) Q. William Riker even allows for an interesting
  six-person away team capable of beating Q - add five Exocomps and a
  Lower Decks (thanx to Reg Barclay for this cool combo ;-) )

  The Download is also one of the more usable ones in a Federation deck -
  Hugh might be a nice card to do something about the Borg Ship, but
  you'll have to tent for him before you meet the Borg. With a quick
  Anti-Matter Spread downloaded from your tent or deck you can at least
  survive a Borg attack in the typical Federation ship (same goes for a
  Borg Cube - apart from the Queen and Locutus all personnel aboard it have
  CUNNING <8, so the typical Retasked cube will suffer -7 or more to its
  WEAPONS, enough to have an Enterprise D or E survive the
  attack). Riker as a living anti-Borg life insurance. Definitely the first
  Riker I'll put into my decks if the theme fits.

  @{b}@{u}Wormhole Negotiations@{ub}@{uu} + Pardek
  by Jason Winter : Q@decipher.com

  from Basic Set

  One of the strengths of the Romulans (no, really, they have them!) is a
  strong mix of both Diplomacy and Treachery. A mission like Wormhole
  Negotiations is a natural, since it requires large amounts of either
  skill. And Pardek with Diplomacy x2 and Treachery is the ideal man for
  the job.

  Trivia note: "Unification" is not the only Star Trek two-parter
  Malachi Throne (Pardek) has appeared in. He also played Commodore Mendez,
  who presided over Spock's court-martial in original Trek's
  "The Menagerie."

  Play an Iconian Gateway and just taunt your opponent into using it.
  When he does, redirect him (with the Wrong Door) to Qualor II and watch
  all his affiliated personnel go into stasis!

  Tired of having your Yuta thwarted by your opponent's Marouk? You might
  consider stocking a Brain Drain in your Q's Tent. Just before Marouk
  and company attempt the mission where you seeded Yuta, give her a
  really bad brain cramp. She'll lose her ability to counter Yuta, and
  you'll be able to pick at the Away Team however you want to. You may
  even be able to take Marouk out of the picture permanently if you pick
  the number 4.
