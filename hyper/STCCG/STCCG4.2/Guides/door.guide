    @{b}Plays on a ship (with at least one staffing icon), outpost or
    docking site. Once each turn, any personnel present who has
    Computer Skill and either Treachery or Greed may target
    one opposing personnel (or Rogue Borg) present of lower
    STRENGTH or CUNNING. Target is "tossed out the airlock"
    (Borg, Rogue Borg and androids float in space until beamed;
    others die). Target's owner may counter-attack next turn.
@{ub}

    For a description of terms used see @{"Legend" link LEGEND}.

    From the @{"Glossary" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/MAIN"}:

"Any personnel present" can toss a target out the airlock once
"each turn" of that personnel's owner. Either player may use the text of
this doorway if his personnel is present, but only on his own turn.

The @{"opposing" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/OPPOSING"} personnel (or Rogue Borg) must have lower STRENGTH or
CUNNING than the personnel tossing him out. CUNNING is not defined as an
attribute of Rogue Borg, so STRENGTH is the only applicable attribute.

The Alpha Quadrant Bajoran Wormhole card must be placed or inserted
adjacent to a Bajor Region location if any are on the spaceline. If
not, the doorway may be inserted anywhere on the spaceline that is
not within another region, creating a Bajor Region. If one end of
the Bajoran Wormhole is destroyed, the other end is discarded also.
See @{"doorways - closed" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DOORCLOSED"}.

Moving through this pair of doorways can be part of a single movement
action to the mouth of the Bajoran Wormhole and through it (continuing
along the spaceline upon exit if Wormhole Navigation Schematic is
played).

    (destroys) all other cards here. Every four full turns,

    Behind the scenes:
    This card's game text originally "sucked in" (rather than "pulled in")
    locations. To this day, certain members of our product development
    team still like to joke that "this card sucks."

    From the @{"Glossary" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/MAIN"}:

If this doorway "pulls in" the last location on either end
of the spaceline, it stops alternating and continues to pull in
locations from the remaining side. Cards that can close a doorway (e.g.,
Revolving Door and Door-Net) suspend the Black Hole's game text and, as
a result, are not pulled in. See @{"doorways - closed" link "XXPATH:glossary.guide/DOORCLOSED"}.

When a ship in a Temporal Rift (or Time Travel Pod) is located at a
spaceline location that is pulled into a Black Hole, the ship is not
immediately discarded, because the ship is time traveling and thus not
really at that location; we just leave the card there to indicate where
it will eventually return. Move the ship to the Black Hole location
itself until it reappears "on schedule," at the end of a turn. If you
nullify the Temporal Rift with an Alternate Universe Door before the
time it would be pulled in, you may move the ship away before the end of
the turn and escape destruction.

This doorway may only be played between two of the missions named {univ}
Space. It does not refer to other universal space-location [S] missions,
such as {univ} Patrol Neutral Zone.
