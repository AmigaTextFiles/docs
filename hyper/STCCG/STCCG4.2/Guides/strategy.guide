                   It won the World Championship against the toughest

                   About the deck:
                   On a dare, Brad deFruiter played a Colony deck in
                   Sunday's semifinals competition. Although it didn't fare
                   that well, it certainly was the most innovative deck in the
                   torunament, and led to a most memorable 94-94 tie with
                   Kathy "Major Rakal" McCracken. I still wonder how it
                   did that well...

@Node CARDCOMBOS "Strategy/Card Combos"

    @{b}ST:TNG CCG Card Combinations@{ub}

These card combinations have been documented by Q from Decipher


Edo Probe + Cytherians

Seed the Cytherians first, so that the Edo Probe is revealed first. When the
Edo Probe comes up, ask your opponent (in your best Jim Carrey voice) "Do you
feel lucky?  Huh?"

If he does elect to continue, he'll hit the Cytherians and be forced to take
off for the deepest reaches of space, which will trigger the Edo Probe and
make him lose 10 points.  Granted, he'll gain 15 when he completes the
Cytherians, but the overall net gain is only 5 points.  That's probably worth
taking out one of your opponent's ships for several turns.  For added fun,
throw in a Q-Net to delay him indefinitely.


Jean-Luc Picard + Cloaked Mission

As if you needed anything else to do with Picard!  And here's a mission that
requires Diplomacy + Honor + Navigation.  Picard has all three of these skills,
and anytime you can do a mission with one personnel, that's a Good Thing.
Granted, Cloaked Mission is a Klingon mission, so this could cause some
difficulty.  But if you're playing a dual Klingon/Fed deck or have some
Espionage cards, this is too good to pass up.


Pardek + Wormhole Negotiations

One of the strengths of the Romulans (no, really, they have them!) is a
strong mix of both Diplomacy and Treachery.  A dilemma like
Wormhole Negotiations is a natural, since it requires large amounts of either
skill.  And Pardek with Diplomacy x2 and Treachery is the ideal man for the
job.
Trivia note:  "Unification" is not the only Star Trek two-parter Malachi
              Throne (Pardek) has appeared in.  He also played Commodore Mendez,
              who presided over Spock's court-martial in original Trek's
              "The Menagerie."


Iconian Gateway + Outpost

A combo featuring an outpost?  Is he mad?
Not quite.  The Iconian Gateway can be a nice way to get around, but it's a
one-way trip.  Once you've sent your people through to another planet, they're
stuck there, just like one big Love Interest (which isn't a suitable topic
for a family game).  So, if you were wise enough to stock an extra outpost
in your deck, you can build it on the turn after using the Gateway and your
crew will be safe.


Love Interest + Qualor II Rendezvous

A bit of a no-brainer, but fun anyway.  Love Interests are good enough cards
as it is, but if you can arrange to have Qualor II at the end of the spaceline,
they're even better.  If your opponent's affiliated personnel hit your
Love Interest, they'll run off to Qualor II where they'll be placed in
stasis until the mission can be completed.  What more can I say?



Energy Vortex + Temporal Rift (+ AU Door)

If you liked playing with Temporal Rifts, you're no doubt distressed over the
power Alternate Universe Doorways now have over them (FAQ-ly note:  Doorways
can only be played on your turn).  Even worse, not even Q2 or Amanda Rogers
can counter them!  So, what's the solution?
If you really need to get that Rift on his ship during his turn, just make
sure to have an Energy Vortex in your hand.  When he tries to nullify your
Rift with his doorway, just show him the Energy Vortex and wave your
forefinger in his face like your mother did when she caught you stealing
from the cookie jar.  That'll teach him to mess with other dimensions!


And finally...
Find the combo!


Risa Shore Leave + ?? + ??

With the cards currently available, there is only one way for the
Risa Shore Leave mission to be completed with only two personnel.  Can you
figure out which two it is?
For those of you who don't have the card, Risa Shore Leave is a
Federation mission with the requirements of
Music + Youth + CIVILIAN x2 + Female + Male.

A warning:  If you thought Targs and Parallel Romances were icky, wait
until you see who the lucky vacationers to Risa are!

               "What do you have in there?"

               Strategies and uses for Q's Tent
               by Jason Winter (Q@decipher.com)

               Q's Tent
               Doorway

               Place one atop Q's Tent side deck (up to 13
               different cards) during the seed phase. Q's
               Tent is now open and in play. OR Stock in deck
               and use as follows: Once per turn, play to
               take a card from tent into your hand, either
               your choice (discard doorway) or random
               selection (place doorway on top of your draw
               deck). Must show card to opponent. Draw no
               cards this turn.

               Q doesn't have a bag of tricks. He's got a
               whole tent. With Q's Tent, you can get any
               card, any time, when you need it.

               Anyone's who's ever said "If I only had this
               one card!" during a game (and we all have)
               will appreciate the immediate use of the Tent.
               Stock several in your deck and stock the right
               cards in your Q's Tent and you'll be able to
               get that vital card when you need it.
               Essentially, each Q's Tent you draw allows you
               to select the card in your Tent that will be
               most useful to you at that time. It's as if
               the Q's Tent could "morph" like Odo into any
               one of 13 cards -- your choice! But what are
               "the right cards"? There are two main
               approaches to take:

               1) Stock "specialized" cards. Cards like
               Interrogation and Brainwash will do you no
               good in your hands if you don't capture any
               characters. Now you can wait until you can
               capture someone before expending resources to
               get and use these cards. Add Madred for extra
               fun.

               Cards that are only useful dependent on your
               opponent's cards are also good choices.
               Klingon Civil War, Incoming Messages,
               Espionage, and Off Switch are good choices
               here.

               2) Stock "must-have" cards. If you want to be
               sure you get a certain card early in the game,
               you can stock several Q's Tents in your deck
               and retrieve them from the Tent as soon as you
               get just one Tent in your hand. There are many
               obvious choices here: Red Alert, The Traveler,
               Genetronic Replicators, Static Warp Bubble,
               and Treaties are just a few.

               One or two slots in your tent should also be
               saved for "emergency" cards. Putting one ship
               there will make sure you don't sit at your
               outpost all game. A spare outpost itself is a
               good idea. If you're worried about Cardassian
               Traps, keep an Empath or two in the Tent.
               Kevin Uxbridge is also an easy choice.

               By using "random mode," you can
               (theoretically) go through every card in your
               Tent, given enough time. If you stock only
               "must have" cards, you can get all your
               powerful cards out, and leave your opponent
               gawking.

               Other uses for Q's Tent:

               If you're playing with Q's Planet, set up a
               three-dilemma combo and put it in your Tent,
               ready to seed if the Planet comes out. Yuta,
               Armus, and Hunter Gangs can really smash an
               Away Team (and you do have a Thine Own Self to
               follow up with, right?). Parallel Romance,
               Male's Love Interest, and Female's Love
               Interest is also effective, allowing you to
               remove up to four personnel from the Away
               Team. Of course, your opponent can also put
               dilemmas there as well, so this planet could
               have up to six dilemmas(!) underneath it.

               Keep one half of "compatible personnel pairs"
               in your Tent, if you don't really need one of
               them. For instance, K'mtar is generally more
               useful than Alexander. Put K'mtar in your
               deck, and if you want to "pump him up," go get
               Alexander. Other examples include Lakanta and
               Wesley Crusher, Keiko and Miles O'Brien (when
               we make him), Ira Graves and Kareen Brianon,
               and Paul and Jenice Manheim.

               Stock a Devidian Doorway in your Tent. If you
               have a Tent card in your hand and are
               absolutely desperate, make a Devidian Door
               play and get the Door from your Tent on your
               next turn! Just watch out for Energy Vortex
               and Wrong Door!

               Finally, are you tired of getting your outpost
               destroyed every game? Stock the IKC T'Ong and
               an outpost in your Tent. As long as you can
               get an engineer in your hand, you can use the
               T'Ong to get that engineer into play, and then
               he can build you an outpost! If the outpost is
               non-aligned, you can use this combo in any
               deck!

               May the Great Bird of the Galaxy bless you and
               may your Q's Tent never be closed!

               Square One: The Fundamentals of Building a Game Deck
               From Jason Winter, aka Q: Q@decipher.com
               February 1997

               Hello, and welcome to Starbase One, a new
               series of articles for Star Trek: Customizable
               Card Game for the beginning player. The world
               of Star Trek can be intimidating with all its
               FAQs, doorways, and dilemmas. In this series,
               I'll try to write with the beginner in mind and
               try to present information in a clear, concise
               manner.

               So, where do we start? Chances are, if you're
               reading this, you have some cards. If you
               don't, go get some! Got 'em? Good. Now that
               you've done that, take a look at what you have.
               If you have the Introductory Two-Player Game,
               you have everything you need to play right off
               the start. But what if you don't have the
               Two-Player Game? Then you just have a bunch of
               cards with a lot of pretty pictures. However,
               do try to read through the starter deck
               rulebook. While you don't need to completely
               understand every concept and complexity, I
               won't be able to explain every little thing in
               this article and will refer you back to that
               rulebook at times.

               With just two starter decks, one can generally
               put together a playable deck. Granted, some
               substitutions might have to be made (see
               below), and what you have won't win any
               tournaments, but you can at least start playing
               with it (assuming your friend has also bought
               two starter decks and has this article).

               The first thing you should do is separate your
               cards. Separate the personnel, ships, and
               outposts by color. Put all Federation cards in
               one pile, Klingons in another, Romulans in
               another, and non-aligneds in another. Then
               separate the rest of your cards by card type --
               event, interrupt, dilemma, mission, and
               equipment. If you have any doorways, just set
               them aside for now.

               Examine your mission cards. These will be the
               driving force behind your first deck. As you
               develop other strategies, you will choose to
               base your decks around other themes, and
               missions might not be the first things you
               select. But for now, you should start with your
               missions.

               Sort the different missions. You will need at
               least six missions that can be attempted with
               just one affiliation (affiliation symbols on
               missions are explained on page 9 of the starter
               deck rulebook). See if you have that. If you
               don't, you'll need to make a Treaty deck --
               that's Trek "lingo" for a deck with more than
               one affiliation in it. If that's the case,
               select two of your affiliations based on the
               number of missions you can do with them, the
               overlap of their symbols on the missions, and
               the number of cards you have available from
               that affiliation.

               Time out! That's a lot to think about! This is
               your first balancing act, but it's not the last
               one you'll do. Playing this game is like making
               a great meal. You have to get all the proper
               ingredients together and then you have to make
               sure you don't burn your roast while you're
               stirring your soup.

               So, back to your missions. Let's assume you
               have your six missions, and based on that,
               you've decided which affiliation(s) you're
               going to play. If you don't have six decent
               missions, see "Substitutions," below. Now you
               need the right personnel. All your missions
               require skills and your personnel have them.
               Select personnel who match the skills and
               affiliations of your missions. Don't forget to
               include your non-aligned personnel!

               If you have plenty of cards, you'll probably
               want at least two of each skill that you need
               in your deck. If a mission requires multiples
               of a skill, such as Treachery x3, you'll want
               about double that (five or six Treachery). At
               this early stage, you might not have those kind
               of resources, though, so make the best of it.

               In addition to the number of personnel required
               to complete missions, you'll want to make sure
               to have at least one or two of every classification
               (OFFICER, SECURITY, etc.).

               Classifications are usually used to overcome
               dilemmas. Take a moment to look at your
               dilemmas and you'll see that most of them
               mention classifications. Many pieces of
               equipment also add classifications. If you find
               that you have a lot of OFFICER's, for example,
               throw in a Medical Kit to help all those
               OFFICER's out. If you have a lot of SCIENCE
               personnel, throw in an Engineering Padd to give
               them all ENGINEER, and so on.

               When it's all said and done, you should have
               about 20 personnel. Combine that with your six
               missions, two outposts (let's assume you're
               playing two affiliations), and two equipment
               cards, and that totals 30 cards. You're halfway
               to a deck of 60 cards!

               Add about five ships, of whatever affiliations
               you have. While bigger usually is better, you
               might want one or two of your ships to have
               minimal staffing requirements, such as one
               staff icon or no icons at all, in case you need
               a quick, easy ride. Staffing is described on
               page 17 of the starter deck rulebook.

               Now it's time to select events and interrupts.
               This is mostly a trial-and-error experience.
               For now, just briefly read the card text and
               put in whatever cards seem helpful. As you play
               with your deck, you'll find that some cards
               work well and some cards don't, so you'll be
               constantly tuning and modifying your deck to
               get the optimum card mix. You'll want about
               10-15 total events and interrupts in your deck.

               Good common events include: Red Alert!, Q-Net,
               Static Warp Bubble, and Res-Q. Also, you'll
               need to throw in whatever treaty is right for
               your deck.

               Good interrupts include: Palor Toff,
               Countermanda, and Loss of Orbital Stability.
               Although they are uncommons, some of the
               strongest interrupts are Scan, Full Planet
               Scan, Kevin Uxbridge, Amanda Rogers, and Q2. If
               you have them, put them in your deck.

               Finally, we come to dilemmas. If you have fewer
               than 15, throw 'em all in! At this early stage,
               you're better off just going with everything
               and experimenting to see what works. As common
               cards go, some of the best dilemmas are Love
               Interests, Impassable Door, and Microbiotic
               Colony. Uncommon and rare dilemmas are almost
               always stronger, so definitely throw those in,
               if you have any.

               And that should just about do it! Just add or
               subtract a few cards to get you to exactly 60,
               and you're ready to roll! Now all you have to
               do is get your friend to buy two decks and then
               you can show him this article.

               Substitutions

               It's possible that you won't have everything
               you need to make your initial deck. You may be
               lacking a vital card such as a treaty or an
               outpost. If a Warp Pack is available, you
               should be able to make do with a non-aligned
               outpost. Warp Packs are a premium pack
               containing cards that are not found in any
               regular expansion pack, including seven common
               missions. Build a little flexibility and power
               in your decks, right from the start. Just
               contact Decipher to get a Warp Pack. You'll
               find the information you need right here on the
               web site.

               If you lack a Warp Pack, or a non-aligned
               outpost, substitute another outpost for the
               kind you need. Just make it clear with your
               playing partner what you are doing.

               Similarly, if you lack the proper treaty, just
               "pretend" that the treaty you have is the one
               you need. Again, you might want to clear this
               with your playing partner.

               Conclusion

               So, you think you're done with your deck? Not
               by a long shot. As you play, you'll find new
               combos and old ideas that you just can't seem
               to work in your deck. Even greater than the
               game itself is the meta-game of continually
               adjusting and modifying your deck. Your deck
               will constantly evolve and mutate into a new
               monster as you add and remove cards between
               matches. These guidelines will give you a place
               to start, and serve as your first step into the
               greater world of Trek.

               The Fundamentals of Building a Game Deck@{ub}

               Square One: Part II, The Fundamentals of
               Building a Game Deck
               From Jason Winter, aka Q: Q@decipher.com
               February 1997

               David has just bought his first two decks of
               Star Trek: Customizable Card Game. He sorts
               them by card type and comes up with the
               following numbers:

               7 unique missons
               2 duplicate missions

               Federation:       Klingon:
               5 ships           4 ships
               11 personnel      20 personnel

               Romulan:
               2 outposts        Non-aligned:
               3 ships           1 ship
               13 personnel      2 personnel

               10 equipment
               15 events
               14 interrupts
               11 dilemmas

               The first thing David does is look over his
               missions. Here are the affiliations on his
               missions:

               F/K/R
               F/K/R
               K/R
               K
               K
               R
               R

               He only has two Federation missions. However,
               each mission could be done by either Klingons
               or Romulans, so it looks like David will make a
               Klingon/Romulan deck. Fortunately, David has
               more Klingon and Romulan cards than he does
               Federation.

               So, of the seven missions, which one should he
               take out? He examines the skill requirements on
               each mission. One of the Klingon missions
               require Diplomacy, and David has no Klingons
               with Diplomacy (he does have one Romulan,
               though, and while he could use the Romulan on
               that mission with a treaty, it's a risky
               venture at best). So "Krios Suppression" bites
               it and David has his six missions.

               They are:
               Expose Cover Supply (R, Treachery x3 + Navigation)
               Covert Rescue (R, Diplomacy + Leadership + Navigation)
               Fever Emergency (K, MEDICAL x3 OR Biology + OFFICER)
               Relief Mission (K/R, Geology OR Physics)
               Investigate Anomaly (F/K/R, Exobiology + STRENGTH > 35)
               Study Plasma Streamer (F/K/R, Astrophysics + Youth)

               Now, David looks at his personnel and takes all
               his Klingons and Romulans who match one of the
               skills on his missions. He has a total of 22
               personnel: 10 Klingons, 10 Romulans, and 2
               non-aligneds.

               Remember, though, that classifications are
               important in addition to skills. Let's look at
               what classifications we've got:

               Klingon:
               3 Officers
               4 Science
               2 Medical
               1 V.I.P.

               Romulan:
               2 Officer
               2 Medical
               3 Security
               2 V.I.P.

               Non-aligned:
               2 Medical
               1 Science
               (One personnel has two classifications)

               No Klingon Security, no Romulan Science, and
               absolutely no Engineers!

               David looks over his personnel and sees that he
               has plenty of Romulan Treachery, so he elects
               to dump one of his V.I.P.'s with Treachery in
               favor of an Engineer. Unfortunately, he's got
               no Romulan Science in his decks, so he'll have
               to make do!

               On the Klingon side, one V.I.P. contributes
               only Youth, and an Officer has just the skill
               of Honor. Both can be removed and replaced with
               2 Security. Also, one of the non-aligned
               Medical only lists Greed as his one skill.
               We'll just take him out.

               That gives us 21 personnel. See all the Science
               (and no Engineers)? David decides to add an
               Engineering PADD to give his Science personnel
               the skill of Engineer.

               David chooses a mix of large and small for his
               ships, and picks out a Klingon K'Vort and
               Vor'Cha, a Romulan Scout Vessel and Science
               Vessel, and a non-aligned Combat Vessel. David
               only has two outposts, both Romulan. With his
               friend's permission, he'll pretend that one of
               them is Klingon. That brings him up to 35
               cards.

               Now, David looks over his events. He picks out
               generically useful ones, like Static Warp
               Bubble, Q-Net, Res-Q, and Red Alert. He also
               picks out his one treaty, which is
               Klingon/Federation, but his partner will let
               him use it as a Klingon/Romulan treaty. David
               has two Gaps in Normal Space, so he decides to
               add one. He also has an Espionage: Romulan on
               Klingon. Not only will this help his Romulans
               to do an opponent's mission, but, in a pinch,
               he can also use it to do his own!

               David doesn't quite have the same easy choices
               for interrupts. He selects Scan and Loss of
               Orbital Stability first, and then looks over
               his other cards. He has Tachyon Detection Grid
               (which requires 4 ships) and Particle Fountain
               (which requires 2 Engineers). Both cards
               require resources that will be difficult to get
               out. David just decides to throw in his other 7
               interrupts, bringing his deck size up to 51.

               Adding 11 dilemmas to his deck gives David 62.
               Oops! He'll have to shave out two cards. Since
               the interrupts were handled rather haphazardly,
               David will examine them in more detail. He has
               two Incoming Message cards, one Romulan and one
               Klingon. If his opponent isn't playing both
               those affiliations, one will be wasted, so
               David decides to take them out.

               Here is the final deck:

               Fever Emergency

               Remember, this is only the beginning. This deck
               could still use some work. But that's next
               time...

           Fine-tuning Your Decks@{ub}
           From Forrest P. Halfstar
           August 1997

           I see you're back. Well, by now you've played
           your deck a few times, and you've probably
           noticed some things that didn't work as well as
           you wanted. So, what do you do now? Make
           changes! Of course the type of changes, as well
           as how you make the changes, will depend on a
           few things...

           What other cards do you have?

           If you don't have anything else to put in your
           deck, you're going to have a hard time changing
           things. There are a number of ways to acquire
           new cards. Some players buy a few packs at a
           time, and then trade things in and out of their
           deck as they can. Other players, normally those
           with more money, will buy a box of cards
           (either starter or expansion packs). This gives
           them a much larger selection of cards to choose
           from, as well as many more options, and
           strategies, to try out.

           Decipher's Collectors Tin is a complete set of
           the Star Trek Customizable Card Game: The Next
           Generation Premiere edition cards. This is a
           great educational tool. With every card at your
           disposal, you can quickly learn the positive
           and negative effects of each card. (Note: While
           the silver border cards of the Collectors Tin
           have recently been okayed for use in sanctioned
           tournament play, Decipher has stated the ruling
           is provisional. The cards were not originally
           intended for this use, and Decipher reserves
           the right to re-evaluate the ruling at a later
           time).

           You can also trade some of the cards you have,
           for some of the cards you want, or even buy
           individual cards. Many card shops buy, sell, or
           trade individual cards, referred to as singles.
           And, theoretically, if you've been playing,
           then you should know at least one other person
           you can trade with!

           Of course, you don't have to part with your
           valued cards or money, just to see if you want
           to keep the card. On the Decipher web site, in
           the Star Trek Product Library area, Decipher
           has a picture of every Star Trek card they've
           made and printed. You can look through all of
           them, and see what you can use to help your
           deck.

           If you find a card you like, then you can test
           it in your deck using a "proxy." A "proxy" is a
           card you have right now, that is temporarily
           acting as a stand-in for another card. After
           playing with the "proxy" of a card, if you like
           what it did, go get the card and throw it in.

           What you'd like to fix, or how you want to
           modify your deck:

           One thing to keep in mind is that you don't
           only fix a deck that doesn't work anymore.
           Seriously, just because you've been winning
           games, doesn't mean your deck is perfect. Maybe
           there are some things you just can't get to
           work right, or maybe you just saw your opponent
           do something cool that you want to add. Here
           are some way to go about find what you need to
           change and how to change them . . .

           I barely score any points before my opponent
           wins the game:

           This can be solved in a couple of ways. The
           first way is to add more personnel who can
           contribute skills to the solution of your
           missions. Another way is to even, or overcome,
           the speed gap between the decks. If your deck
           is playing really slow, Red Alert!, The
           Traveler: Transcendence, and Fajo can all help
           speed you up.

           If you're playing along at a decent speed, but
           your opponent is going much faster than you,
           Yellow Alert, Klim Doakchim (AU), Static Warp
           Bubble, Q-Net, and even Telepathic Alien
           Kidnappers are cards that will slow them down.

           I can't keep my personnel alive long enough to
           solve the mission:

           There are a few reasons this could be
           happening. One is the Dilemmas. One solution is
           to take a look at what the dilemma does (e.g.
           its requirements, how it kills people, what
           exactly it does). If you can add personnel that
           can help you overcome the dilemmas, that could
           help (of course, this is assuming your opponent
           doesn't change his deck!). Another way to fix
           the problem is to "red-shirt" the missions.
           "Red-shirting" is when you have one or two
           people attempt a mission, in order to clear the
           way for the rest of the personnel to finish it
           off. Basic strategies like this will be covered
           more in-depth in the next article.

           My opponent keeps playing annoying cards, and I
           can't stop him:

           Most of the non-dilemma, annoying cards can be
           prevented, or even destroyed, but only by a few
           cards. The Traveler: Transcendence will nullify
           Static Warp Bubble. Intruder Force Field will
           cause your opponent's Telepathic Alien
           Kidnappers to affect themselves. Most annoying
           Event card can be nullified with Kevin Uxbridge
           or possible Kevin Uxbridge: Convergence (AU).
           You can even nullify most of those annoying
           Interrupt cards using Amanda Rogers.

           Of course, there are even more fun cards that
           will really annoy your opponents back, you just
           have to look for them. As for those mean things
           your opponents have done to you, that you want
           to use against them... Just thinks about what
           they did, and what they used to do it, and
           throw them into the deck.

           Your opponent plays a "patterned deck":

           If you've started to notice a pattern in the
           type of cards in your opponents' decks, you
           could be pretty annoying by throwing in cards
           that would have some fun effects on them.

           For example, all your opponents have been
           playing Klingon decks that rely heavily on Red
           Alert! and The Traveler: Transcendence. You
           have a few options. You could throw in Yellow
           Alert to cancel their Red Alert! and there's a
           dilemma that works against The Traveler:
           Transcendence called Thought Fire. Of course,
           you could always throw in however many Klingon
           Incoming Messages as you have, and for real
           fun, play a Klingon deck of your own and use
           Klingon Civil War!

           Ooops! One slight problem... You should only
           have 60 cards in your deck. How many do you
           have? 73? 89? Well, it looks like we're going
           to have to weed out a few of those extra cards.
           When taking out cards, you have to watch what
           you take out, and make sure your deck is still
           well balanced. That doesn't mean that it has to
           have a specific number of each type of card,
           but you don't want a deck with 6 mission, 1
           outpost, and 53 personnel. Generally, you'll
           want as many personnel as you'll need to
           complete the missions (That includes people to
           overcome dilemmas). You don't want too many
           events. If you have loads of events, your deck
           will slow down by bunches.

           So generally take it kinda light on those.
           You'll want enough ships to be able to normally
           get one within the first 5 or 6 turns, so
           you'll want to do a little bit of math. Pretty
           much, you'll want one ship for every 10 cards
           in your deck (Takes into consideration the
           whole uncertainty thing) You might want to add
           another outpost, as there are some ways of
           losing your first one. Interrupts are handy
           additions, especially because the don't count
           to your one card per turn limit. Of course,
           there are some cards that change all this
           around, but we'll talk about those in a later
           article. One thing for you to keep in mind is
           that you can't solve missions without people,
           and it's really hard to score 100 points before
           your opponent without missions.

           Finally, since you've been playing for a while
           (right?) throw out any cards you couldn't use
           in your last few games. If you've been stuck
           with a specific interrupt in your hand for the
           last three games, waiting for your opponent to
           cloak just so you could play it, and he hasn't,
           that says something about the value of that
           card in your deck.

           Conclusion:

           As you become more comfortable with the cards,
           and the game, you'll develop an understanding
           of what the cards can do, and how you can use
           them to your advantage. For now, just try new
           things out. After a while, decks will get old,
           and you'll want to change them anyway. Think of
           it this way. When you try things out, who knows
           what you can think of, and how many ways you
           can earn the respect, and hatred of your
           opponents. Until next time!

           Next time at Starbase One...

           Hmmmm... You've got the cards, you've got a
           deck, and it plays pretty well. What can you
           start thinking about now to improve your play
           of the game? How about strategies!

@link SAMPLEGAME
  @{b}Sample Game for Star Trek[TM]: Customizable Card Game[TM]@{ub}

            written by Helge Blohmer aka Wesley Crusher
                            May 1997

               Note: This sample game has been created with
               two nearly equal power decks consisting of only
               common and uncommon cards to allow the
               beginning player a good chance at having most
               of the cards used. It utilizes cards from all
               expansions up to Q-Continuum, but no side
               decks.

               During the write-up the game has actually been
               laid out (and played as "solitaire") with the
               Dilemmas being actual secrets so the tactical
               decisions of the players are as close to real
               as possible. Only a few tweaks have been made
               from the randomly determined flow of the game
               when the limited card selection threatened to
               make the game uninteresting.

               The rule set used is the complete set of core
               rules with none of the options being active.

               The Players are Adrian, using a Federation deck
               with mostly space missions and Beth, playing a
               Romulan all-planet deck. Adrian goes first.

               Preparation: Both players customize 60 card
               decks and sort them into five stacks: Missions,
               Doorways, Dilemma/Artifact cards, starting
               Outposts and the Draw Deck. The mission deck
               and the draw deck are then shuffled.

               @{b}Seed Phase I@{ub} : Missions

               Adrian draws "Study Hole in Space"
               from his mission deck and seeds it in
               the middle of the table with the name
               facing himself.

               Beth draws "Covert Rescue" and seeds
               it to her left of Adrian's mission,
               with the mission name facing her.
               This later serves to find out which
               player seeded which mission.

               A: draws "Test Mission" and places it
                  next to Study Hole in space.

               B: draws "Covert Installation" and
                  seeds it next to Test Mission.

               A: draws "Restore Errant Moon",
                  seeded next to Covert Rescue.

               B: draws "Relief Mission", seeds it
                  next to Covert Installation.

               A: draws "Study Stellar Collision",
                  seeds it beside Restore Errant Moon.

               B: draws "Expose Covert Supply",
                  seeded next to Study Stellar
                  Collision.

               A: draws "Diplomacy Mission", seeds it
                  next to Relief Mission.

               B: draws "Extraction", seeds it next
                  to Diplomacy Mission.

               A: draws "Repair Mission" which goes
                  next to Expose Covert Supply

               B: draws "Strategic Diversion", seeds
                  it next to Repair Mission.

               Now the spaceline is complete and seeding
               proceeds to the next phase. Beth made the
               last seed during the previous phase, so
               she gets the first play now.

               @{b}Seed Phase II@{ub}: Doorways

               Beth seeds an Alternate Universe Door.

               Adrian also has that card and seeds it.

               Both players decline to play more
               Doorways, so we proceed to the next phase.
               Adrian goes first.

               @{b}Seed Phase III@{ub}: Dilemmas and Artifacts

               Now the players seed their Dilemmas. As
               these cards represent obstacles and plot
               twists, in this sample game we will
               preserve the uncertainty by not telling
               what the seeded cards are. Players
               alternate seeding one card each until both
               pass.

               A common beginners' mistake here is to
               shuffle the Dilemmas. This is not
               required. Rather, players may select what
               Dilemma to place at which position and
               also in which order. This allows for the
               creation of strategic combos.

               Adrian selects his first Dilemma, seeds it
               face down under Covert Rescue.

               Beth selects one Dilemma, seeds it face
               down under Test Mission.

               Adrian selects the next Dilemma and seeds
               this one under Covert Rescue, too. The
               Dilemma goes under the first one and will
               be encountered before the other one when
               the mission is attempted later.

               (Both players continue, alternating the
               seeding of their Dilemmas. As this is
               pretty straightforward, we will skip this
               back and forth procedure and jump forward
               to the point where both players have
               seeded 17 Dilemmas)

               Adrian seeds his last Dilemma under Covert
               Rescue and declares he's done with
               Dilemmas and Artifacts

               Beth seeds her last under Restore Errant
               Moon and also declares she is done with
               the phase.

               The spaceline now looks like this when
               viewed from Adrian's side (left to right):
                 Extraction - 3 seed cards
                 Diplomacy Mission - 4 seed cards
                 Relief Mission - 2 seed cards
                 Covert Installation - 3 seed cards
                 Test Mission - 3 seed cards
                 Study Hole in Space - 2 seed cards
                 Covert Rescue - 4 seed cards
                 Restore Errant Moon - 4 seed cards
                 Study Stellar Collision - 2 seed cards
                 Expose Covert supply - 3 seed cards
                 Repair Mission - 3 seed cards
                 Strategic Diversion - 3 seed cards.

               As Beth went last during the phase, she
               will start the actual game, but first the
               players need to establish their outposts.

               @{b}Seed Phase IV@{ub}: Outposts

               Beth seeds a Romulan outpost at Relief
               Mission, Adrian his Federation Outpost at
               Study Stellar Collision.

               Both players shuffle their draw decks and
               draw seven cards.

               @{b}The Main Game@{ub}

               Turn 1 (Beth)
               Beth reports Mirok to her outpost.
               She then draws a card to end her
               turn.

               Turn 1 (Adrian)
               Adrian plays Red Alert! on table,
               allowing him to play any number of
               equipment, ships or personnel during
               a turn instead of just one. He then
               draws a card to end his turn.

               Turn 2 (Beth)
               Beth reports Dr. Farek and draws a
               card.

               Turn 2 (Adrian)
               Adrian plays Static Warp Bubble,
               forcing Beth to discard one card
               before ending each of her turns and
               draws a card. (He also held several
               personnel, but he can only play
               either the cards from Red Alert! or
               an Event and he chose the Event
               card.)

               Turn 3 (Beth)
               Beth reports Taul to her outpost. She
               discards Metaphasic Shields and then
               draws a card

               Turn 3 (Adrian)
               Adrian reports Nikolai Rozhenko, Bok
               and a Federation PADD. Then he draws
               a card.

               Turn 4 (Beth)
               Beth reports Pardek. She beams Pardek
               down to the planet and attempts the
               mission. The Mission stack is now
               turned over and Pardek faces the
               first Dilemma, Female Love Interest.
               He is unaffected by this (male). The
               Dilemma is discarded, Pardek must
               continue his attempt.

               Next is El-Adrel Creature, a Dilemma
               which attacks the two strongest
               people in the away team. As Pardek is
               alone, Beth has no choice as to have
               him face the creature. He needs a
               STRENGTH > 16 to pass and cannot
               match this with only 6. Pardek is
               killed and the Dilemma is discarded.
               (This strategy is commonly referred
               to as Redshirting. Pardek managed to
               eliminate two Dilemmas before dying
               and cleared the way for Beth's
               important characters.)

               Beth now beams down Mirok and he
               attempts the mission. He has the
               required Physics and scores the
               mission. Beth now leads 20-0 in
               points. Mirok beams back up to the
               outpost. Beth discards Q2 (for the
               Warp Bubble) and draws a card.

               Turn 4 (Adrian)
               Adrian reports McKnight and draws a
               card. (he has a lousy hand, so what
               shall he do :-( )

               Turn 5 (Beth)
               Beth reports Tebok, discards
               Espionage: Romulan on Federation and
               draws a card, hoping for a ship...

               Turn 5 (Adrian)
               Adrian reports the U.S.S: Galaxy.
               Then, he attempts Study Stellar
               Collision from his outpost even
               though he does not have the required
               skills yet, hoping to clear at least
               a few Dilemmas...Turning over the
               first Dilemma card, he encounters
               Empathic Echo, a card that kills a
               random Empath unless there is a
               SECURITY and a MEDICAL present. He
               does not have any Empaths, so nobody
               is killed, however he was unable to
               overcome the conditions, so the
               Dilemma remains in place and his crew
               is stopped.

               With nothing left to do, he draws a
               card.

               Turn 6 (Beth)
               Beth reports N'Vek, discards a
               Medical Kit and draws a card, still
               in dire need for a ship.

               Turn 6 (Adrian)
               Adrian plays Klim Dokachim, an Event
               that denies his opponent his card
               draw when he plays a unique
               personnel. Then he draws a card.

               Turn 7 (Beth)
               Beth reports Tarus (who is universal
               and does not trigger Klim Dokachim),
               discards Movar and draws one card
               (mentally rejoicing because she has
               just drawn a ship)

               Turn 7 (Adrian)
               Adrian plays Kivas Fajo - Collector,
               an Event allowing him to draw 3
               cards. He draws those 3 plus one more
               to end his turn.

               Turn 8 (Beth)
               Beth reports a Scout Vessel and
               boards it with her entire crew.
               Quickly checking all her skills, she
               finds she can solve Covert
               Installation, so she flies over,
               beams down and attempts. The first
               Dilemma is Worshiper. She could pass
               it and score 5 points had she more
               Greed than Honor.

               Unfortunately she has one of each, so
               she does not fulfill that clause. She
               could now pass without scoring (but
               continue her attempt) had she
               Anthropology or an Edo Vessel.
               Unfortunately she just discarded her
               only Anthropologist so she is
               stopped, but the Worshiper is
               discarded. Betty's away team remains
               vulnerable on the planet.
               She discards Palor Toff - Alien
               Trader (her last card) and draws a
               new card.

               Turn 8 (Adrian)
               Adrian has drawn well with his Kivas
               last turn and now reports Taitt,
               Jenna D'Sora, Simon Tarses and a
               Runabout. He gathers all his crew and
               re-attempts the mission.

               As he already knows, the first
               Dilemma is Empathic Echo, which he
               can now pass using Tarses and D'Sora.

               Next is Interphasic Plasma Creatures.
               He has only one SCIENCE, so the
               Dilemma goes on the table, lowering
               all his personnel's STRENGTH by 2.
               Unable to overcome the Dilemma,
               Adrian's crew is stopped and he draws
               a card.

               Turn 9 (Beth)
               Beth plays The Traveler:
               Transcendence. This nullifies
               (destroys) Adrian's Static Warp
               Bubble and allows her to draw two
               cards at the end of each turn.

               She then reattempts Covert
               Installation with her crew.

               The next Dilemma is Hunter Gangs,
               which selects two of her crewmembers
               and kills any of them whose CUNNING
               is an odd number. The selection
               targets Tebok (CUNNING 7) and Dr.
               Farek (CUNNING 8). Tebok is killed by
               the gangs. The Dilemma does not stop
               her as it had no conditions to be
               overcome, only a certain class of
               targets that get affected (Odd
               CUNNING). She continues with her
               decimated crew. The last Dilemma here
               is Parallel Romance which requires a
               male/female couple to be present to
               have any effect. However, Beth's team
               is males only and the Romance is
               discarded.

               But alas, the death of Tebok was bad
               news. Without the Leadership skill
               Tebok provided, Beth cannot solve the
               mission, so she beams back up and
               returns to her outpost aboard the
               Scout Vessel.

               She then draws two cards and ends her
               turn.

               Turn 9 (Adrian)
               Adrian reports the U.S.S. Nebula and
               reattempts his mission. With no more
               Dilemmas in his way, Taitt can solve
               the requirements and Adrian scores 25
               points. Checking through his skills,
               he finds no other mission he could
               solve right now, so he draws a card
               and ends his turn.

               Turn 10 (Beth)
               Beth plays Yellow Alert, an Event
               that nullifies Adrian's Red Alert and
               gives her crew CUNNING +1.

               Rechecking her skill complement, Beth
               finds she can still solve Extraction,
               so she flies over, beams down and
               attempts.

               The first Dilemma is Royale Casino:
               Craps. She would have to show a
               personnel card from her hand for
               Adrian to match, but she has none and
               so the 7 points go to Adrian,
               bringing the score to 32-20.

               Beth is now faced with Security
               Precautions, a Dilemma she could
               overcome with a disruptor. As she has
               none, she is stopped and having
               nothing else to do, she draws two
               cards and ends her turn.

               Turn 10 (Adrian)
               Adrian reports Fleet Admiral Shanthi,
               giving him both needed Diplomacy and
               Leadership. He distributes his crew
               over the two capital ships in the
               hopes of later establishing a
               daisy-chain of ships and moves both
               ships to Covert Rescue. He draws one
               card and ends his turn.

               Turn 11 (Beth)
               Beth reports a Romulan Disruptor and
               beams her away team back to the Scout
               Vessel. Using 5 RANGE, she returns to
               the outpost, picks up her disruptor
               and flies back to Diplomacy Mission.

               Arriving there, she plays Near-Warp
               Transport to get her crew back to
               Extraction, leaving Tarus aboard to
               bring the ship next turn. Faced with
               Security Precautions again, she
               passes using her disruptor. The last
               Dilemma is Rebel Encounter. As Beth
               has a STRENGTH of only 34, she cannot
               pass this way, and not wanting to
               lose a key personnel, she sacrifices
               her Disruptor and passes.

               Taul, N'Vek and Dr. Farek solve the
               mission bringing the score to 55-32.
               Beth draws two cards to end her turn.

               Turn 11 (Adrian)
               Adrian reports Norah Satie. She
               boards the Runabout and flies to
               Covert Rescue. From there, everybody
               boards the Galaxy and moves over to
               Study "Hole in Space". Adrian
               attempts the mission.

               The first Dilemma is Edo Probe,
               forcing him to choose to solve a
               different mission first or risk ten
               points in case he cannot solve the
               mission this turn. Faced with a
               21-point lead by Beth he chooses to
               go for the risk.

               The second Dilemma is Conundrum, he
               passes because he has a total
               INTEGRITY of 49.

               With no more Dilemmas remaining,
               Adrian can score the mission and
               wipes his forehead. The score goes to
               67-55 in his favor.He moves to Test
               Mission and plays Distortion of
               Space/Time Continuum, restoring his
               ship's RANGE.

               He now moves all the way to Diplomacy
               mission, beams down and attempts. The
               first Dilemma is Zaldan, requiring
               Treachery x2, which Nikolai Rozhenko
               and Bok can overcome.

               Second is Matriarchal Society, an
               easy pass for his two female
               Admirals. The third Dilemma, Ferengi
               Attack, is again solved by Bok
               (Greed), though he could also have
               done it using the attribute scores -
               his CUNNING alone is 68 (with the
               PADD), so the STRENGTH drain from
               Interphasic Plasma creatures does not
               hurt him here.

               The last Dilemma is Hologram Ruse,
               requiring CUNNING and INTEGRITY to be
               over 30, an easy requirement for
               Adrian's large crew (also a bad
               choice on Beth's side as the mission
               requirements are nearly identical to
               the Dilemma requirements).

               Adrian solves the mission and is now
               only 3 points away from winning!
               (97-55)

               He also holds a Particle Fountain
               which he would like to play for 5
               points, but unfortunately he lacks a
               second ENGINEER, so he has to draw a
               card and end his turn.

               Turn 12 (Beth)
               Beth reports Sirol to provide the
               vital Leadership. She then plays
               Transwarp Conduit allowing her
               Science Vessel to move double RANGE.
               Tarus moves it to Extraction and she
               picks up her crew (15 RANGE
               remaining). Moving back to her
               Outpost (RANGE remaining: 10), she
               picks up Sirol and moves to Covert
               Installation (7 RANGE remaining). The
               crew beams down, solves the mission
               (no Dilemmas remaining) and back up.
               The last 7 RANGE get her to Study
               Hole in Space.

               She now plays Kevin Uxbridge to get
               rid of Adrian's Klim Dokachim so she
               can draw cards despite reporting
               Sirol. She draws her two cards and
               ends her turn.

               Turn 12 (Adrian)
               Adrian uses Palor Toff - Alien Trader
               to get back his Distortion of
               Space/Time Continuum. He moves his
               USS Galaxy to Test Mission and
               attempts despite not having the
               Physics skill in the hope of hitting
               a Dilemma with a point value or at
               least cleaning out a few for a later
               attempt.

               The first seed is Microbiotic Colony,
               but Adrian has SCIENCE, OFFICER and
               ENGINEER so nothing happens.

               Next is Rascals, turning Shanthi,
               D'Sora, Bok and Rozhenko into kids,
               also nullifying a few valuable skills
               in the process. The Dilemma does not
               stop him, but it severely weakened
               him.

               Last is indeed a point-scoring
               Dilemma but it is not in Adrian's
               favor: The Higher... the Fewer makes
               him pay bitterly for his 9-person
               crew, putting Beth back into the lead
               at 90-88.

               Being out of RANGE, Adrian plays
               Distortion of Space/Time Continuum
               and moves two more places to Covert
               Rescue. (He would have liked to shoot
               that puny Scout to stardust, but
               being Federation he is denied that
               pleasure.)

               He draws a card and ends his turn.

               Turn 13 (Beth)
               Beth moves her Scout to Covert
               Rescue. She beams down her crew and
               attempts the mission.The first seed
               is Royale Casino: Blackjack. She has
               Jaron in her hand, thus a total of 7,
               while Adrian holds no personnel and
               will have to pay 5 to Beth. The new
               score is 95-83 in Beth's favor. Next
               is Q's Vicious Animal Things, Beth
               passes with a STRENGTH of 40. Alien
               Abduction is next. As most of her
               crew have a CUNNING of 8, Beth can
               choose Tarus, the most expendable
               crewmember to be abducted. She is not
               stopped either, so she runs into the
               last Dilemma: Chalnoth! She does not
               have the STRENGTH or SECURITY to
               overcome this and Adrian grinningly
               chooses Sirol to die. Beth is stopped
               and draws 2 cards to end her turn.

               Turn 13 (Adrian)
               Adrian reports Dr. Reyga. The U.S.S.
               Galaxy flies to Restore Errant Moon.
               Norah Satie takes the Runabout to
               pick up Dr. Reyga at the outpost and
               fly back. All others beam down and
               attempt the mission.

               First is an Impassable Door, solved
               by Bok's Computer Skill.

               Second seed is Firestorm, killing all
               crew whose INTEGRITY is less than 5,
               so Bok and Nikolai Rozhenko die.

               The third Dilemma is Archer. Taitt
               and D'Sora pass this.

               The last Dilemma is Alien Parasites.
               Adrian counts his INTEGRITY and finds
               he has 33, just barely enough to pass
               by one measly point. At this point
               the planetbound crew cannot continue,
               lacking the required skills for the
               mission.

               Adrian brings in his two remaining
               personnel from the Runabout. Beth
               tries a last stand and uses Brain
               Drain on Dr. Reyga, trying to remove
               all his skills for this turn, but
               Adrian is prepared and plays Amanda
               Rogers to nullify the Brain Drain
               before it can take effect. Norah
               Satie, luckily unaffected by the
               Rascals, provides the needed
               Leadership and Dr. Reyga has the
               ENGINEER and Astrophysics skills so
               Adrian can solve Restore Errant Moon.

               Adrian scores 30 points, finally
               winning 115-83.

@link ARTITOUR

               @{b}Artifacts in Tournament Play@{ub}

               From Sean O'Reilly
               June 1997


               Recently, someone on the Star Trek:CCG
               Discussion Bulletin Boards asked how artifacts
               work in a tournament setting.

               Well, it's simple and complex. In tournaments
               you may only seed one artifact per planet
               mission. The only exception to this is the
               Cryosatellite which is seeded at a space
               mission (an additional artifact may be seeded
               within the Cryosatellite). When you solve a
               mission where an artifact has been seeded you
               may use it as specified on the card's game
               text. Some artifacts are used immediately and
               discarded, others stay in you Away Team as
               Equipment and then other artifacts go into your
               hand and are played later as Events or
               Interrupts.

               What happens to the artifact when it is used or
               destroyed? In tournament play,the rules are
               slightly different:

               The following five artifacts go
               immediately into your Away Team as
               Equipment when they are recovered. They
               can be destroyed by any card (including
               dilemmas) that normally targets Equipment
               cards. When destroyed, they go into your
               discard pile and may be retrieved:

               1. Orb of Prophecy and Change
               2. Data's Head (when not attached to
                  Data's Body)
               3. Mona Lisa
               4. Interphase Generator
               5. Varon-T Disruptor

               The following two artifacts are played on
               the table immediately and may destroyed by
               certain cards. They are not Events and
               therefore may not be destroyed by Kevin
               Uxbridge. Once destroyed, they go to your
               discard pile and may be retrieved:

               1. Horga'hn (may be destroyed by The
                  Devil or Jamaharron)
               2. Ressikan Flute (may be destroyed by
                  The Devil)

               The following four artifacts may be played
               as Interrupts from your hand after being
               recovered. They may be nullified by Amanda
               Rogers or any card that targets them. If
               nullified, they go to your discard pile
               and may be retrieved. If they are used
               (not nullified by your opponent) they
               instead are put out-of-play because
               interrupts are normally discarded once
               their effect has ended and all artifacts
               that are normally discarded after use are
               instead put out-of-play:

               1. Time Travel Pod
               2. Thought Maker
               3. Samuel Clemens' Pocketwatch
               4. Ophidian Cane

               The following two artifacts are played as
               Events cards from your hand. They may be
               destroyed by Kevin Uxbridge (or Kevin
               Uxbridge: Convergence). Once destroyed
               they go to your discard pile and may be
               retrieved:

               1. Iconian Gateway
               2. Kurlan Naiskos

               The following three artifacts are played
               as Event cards. They, too, may be
               destroyed by Kevin Uxbridge (or other
               cards as stated below). However, because
               their game text says that they are
               discarded when their effect has ended, a
               different outcome happens during
               tournament play. Put these cards
               out-of-play when their effect has ended:

               1. Tox Uthat (may be destroyed by KU;
                  put out-of-play when a Supernova has
                  successfully destroyed all cards at
                  one mission).

               2. Receptacle Stone (may be destroyed
                  by KU:C or KU; put out-of-play on the
                  same turn the card has been played
                  when your turn has ended since the
                  effect on your opponent's ship lasts
                  only this turn).

               3. Vulcan Stone of Gol (may be destroyed
                  by KU:C or KU; once everyone in the
                  Away Team that the card has been
                  played on has lived or died the card
                  is put out-of-play).

               The following four artifacts are played
               immediately after recovery, but there is
               no way currently to destroy or nullify
               their effects. After their effect has
               ended they are put out-of-play:

               1. Betazoid Gift Box (once three cards
                  have been retrieved from your draw
                  deck put the card out-of-play).

               2. Canar (once the female personnel who
                  has had the card played upon her
                  meets up with the selected male
                  personnel the two personnel are
                  discarded and the artifact is put
                  out-of-play).

               3. Blade of Tkon (Once the planet
                  mission has been relocated elsewhere
                  on the spaceline the artifact is put
                  out-of-play).

               4. Cryosatellite (this artifact allows
                  you to seed three AU personnel and
                  one extra artifact at a space
                  mission. Once the mission has been
                  completed, the personnel go aboard
                  your ship or outpost and the artifact
                  is played normally (whether it's an
                  Equipment, Event, etc...) but then
                  the Cryosatellite is put out-of-play
                  since it's effect is immediate (you
                  recover cards seeded 'inside' of it).

               Hope this helps!
