 @{b}The Last War [#1]@{ub} (1998)
 
 In 1944 a mysterious object crashes on Blitz-weary London. Lieutenant Charles
 Terrell is investigating the scene.
 
 In present day Scotland, cocky RAF Tornado pilot Flight Lieutenant Chris Drake
 disobeys orders and shoots down a mysterious object above the North Sea,
 believing it to have directed a weapon on him. His navigator, and friend, is
 killed. Unbeknown to Drake, the alien craft jettisons an escape pod which
 crashes in the wilds of Scotland. At the same time, computer expert Nick Shay
 picks up an unusual signal and calls in Dr. Amanda Tucker, a mathematical
 consultant. Arriving with her daughter, Emily, Tucker works through the night
 with Nick to discover that the signal came from high in the Earth's atmosphere
 and was directed into deep space.
 
 Given the diplomatic implications of the shooting, Major General David Reece,
 a USAF officer working for NATO, is called in. With one of his senior
 officers, the sceptical Squadron Leader Helen Knox, he debriefs Drake and
 grounds him. A search is launched for the pilot of the pod, who is revealed to
 us as Terrell, hardly aged from 1944, and suffering from serious injuries
 following his crash. He has been trying to contact somebody, but when the
 response comes it is evidently not what he expected.
 
 Following a tip-off about an alleged UFO sighting that corresponds with the
 signal, Tucker heads for Scotland. Determined to clear his name, Drake does
 the same. Meanwhile, Nick discovers that there are two signals, one jamming
 the other. Drake and Tucker meet, and there is evidently something between
 them, but their flirtation is interrupted when Tucker gets a call telling her
 that Terrell has been recovered after stumbling into the path of a motorist.
 He's at a civilian hospital, delirious. Arriving shortly before Reece and
 Knox, Drake and Tucker have a little time to examine Terrell injuries. To
 them, the results of the tests that have been carried out indicate that he
 must be an astronaut. Meanwhile Nick is increasingly alarmed by the
 implications of what he is discovering, and makes repeated attempts to call
 Tucker and warn her that there are two sets of aliens involved, evidently
 hostile to each other - she could be in grave danger. Before he can get
 through to her an alien attack begins.
 
 Terrell screams in terror - they are not his people.

 @{b}The Fourth Dimension [#2]@{ub} (1998)
 
 The alien attack is repelled, although not without fatalities. A homing device
 has been found embedded in Terrell's tooth. Tucker removes it and as they take
 it for analysis, Tucker and four military personnel are abducted, including
 the RAF doctor, Wing Commander Friday. Drake supervises Terrell's transfer to
 a high security RAF base. On the way, an unidentified contact heading for the
 convoy causes Reece to order that Drake kill the prisoner. His hesitation
 proves fortuitous when the contact is revealed as unthreatening, but tension
 is high. In the alien craft Tucker and the abductees undergo a series of
 painful and frightening invasive tests. Although understandably distraught,
 Tucker remains alert enough to register the organic construction of the ship.
 
 On Earth, the interrogation of Terrell proves fruitless. When a signal is
 picked up on radar, Flight Lieutenant Radcliffe leads his retrieval team to
 its location, accompanied by Drake. After a terrifying close encounter, they
 discover that Friday and two of the airmen have been returned. Drake is
 distressed to see no sign of Tucker, who remains captive on board the alien
 ship. From her observations she has realised that these beings have the
 ability to exploit higher spatial dimensions. Her attempt to explain her
 theory to the remaining airman fails, and he dies shortly afterwards. Alone
 and terrified she scratches an ideogram into the flesh of her own forearm so
 that she can get a message out even if they kill her. It reads n-D, indicating
 that they are confronting an enemy with multi-dimensional capabilities. We
 will know them as the nDs.
 
 Against orders, Drake decides to interrogate Terrell himself. He bonds with
 him and before he leaves, Terrell reveals his army number. Radcliffe runs a
 check and they discover that Terrell disappeared in 1944. When Reece orders
 that Tucker be kept under surveillance, Drake volunteers for the job. Together
 they start analysing Terrell's escape pod. Tucker is putting a business-like
 face on it, but Drake senses her distance. He tries to ask Emily about her
 mother, and when Tucker discovers him talking to her she reacts aggressively.
 
 Friday and the other airmen are 'activated' by the nDs. One is restrained, and
 the other killed. Having been allowed home under guard, Friday escapes with
 ease and begins a journey to an unknown destination. Drake demands that Tucker
 tell him what happened to her. She confides in him, but begs that she's not
 made unfit for duty - she has to keep working on discovering the nDs
 objective. He agrees. Looking again at the results of medical tests performed
 on the abductees, Drake discovers evidence of implants. He is relieved to find
 that Tucker appears to be clear. Alone, Tucker regards the scratch on her arm
 with dread. It isn't healing normally at all.

 @{b}Only The Dead [#3]@{ub} (1998)
 
 Radcliffe and his men set off in pursuit of Friday, who has hi-jacked a car.
 
 Given the security breach attempted by the other abductees. Reece orders that
 Tucker be confined. She is to see neurosurgeon Group Captain Preston.
 
 The remaining abductee dies on the operating table as Preston attempts to
 remove the implant.
 
 Terrell is still clamming up in response to interrogation. Throughout the
 episode we see his story emerge in flashback. Back in 1944 the crashed ship
 (seen at the start of chapter one) contained two survivors, one of whom was
 shot. The remaining being was taken to a remote sanatorium, where Terrell was
 given leave to try and communicate with it. It appeared to be a peaceful
 creature, but Terrell was forced back to his bomb disposal duties before he
 could establish communication with it.
 
 By drawing a pictograph of the alien distress symbol in a field, Terrell
 allowed himself to be abducted by the creature's own people, known as the
 'Echoes'. Since 1944, travelling close to light speed as one of their pilots,
 he has aged very little relative to humans on Earth.
 
 Progress on unravelling the technology of Terrell's crashed pod is slow and
 the team need his help. When a flash in the sky is followed by radar picking
 up an unidentified craft, Tucker manages to persuade Terrell to help them. He
 identifies the incoming craft as Echo, and not hostile, but a strike is
 already underway and the Echo is shot down. Drake manages to save the injured
 pilot when its craft plunges into a lake. After frantic attempts to
 resuscitate the Echo pilot, it regains consciousness long enough to speak to
 Terrell. Just as its condition stabilises Terrell kills it. Distressed, he
 explains that the Echo asked to die. The flash in the sky was the mothership.
 The Echoes detonated their own ships engines, committing mass suicide rather
 than let themselves be changed and put to a violent purpose by the nDs.
 
 Terrell reveals what he knows of the nDs' plan - before he wouldn't speak for
 fear of endangering the Echoes. He explains that the Echoes have been watching
 Earth. The nDs have been spreading throughout the universe, devising means of
 using every life-form on planets that they colonise. Earth and the life-forms
 on it are similar to the Echoes' home world - the fate that awaits Earth would
 have befallen the Echoes next.
 
 The Echoes are pacifists, and even if they had been disposed towards war,
 their planet is too far away for support to reach us in time. When Terrell was
 shot down the nDs knew that he might pass the truth on to mankind, so now they
 have stepped up their campaign. They can't be stopped. Drake is distressed by
 the realisation that he has precipitated the whole thing.
 
 Friday reaches the town of Kirkhaven and he is undergoing alarming physical
 changes. The wound on Tucker's arm begins to heal as nD tissue.

 @{b}The Fall Of Man [#4]@{ub} (1998)
 
 Reece and Air Marshal Peter Bentley observe a specialist team of pathologists
 as they perform an autopsy on the dead Echo. Afterwards, Bentley interviews
 Terrell and is not convinced by his story. He makes a final demand for proof
 from Reece. Meanwhile, Preston is increasingly concerned about the changes
 occurring in Tucker. She appears to be undergoing a similar process to the
 Echoes. Although she does not tell Tucker of her conclusions, Preston is
 hopeful of being able to test an anti-nD toxin on her.
 
 Reece decides that there is only one way to get the proof they need: to
 capture an nD. Apart from Drake, his officers are unconvinced. Knox in
 particular is concerned that without fully understanding the nature of the
 enemy the plan is needlessly risky.
 
 Tucker is not convinced by Preston's attempts at reassurance and reluctantly
 decides to send Emily away to safety. Although aware it is best for her
 daughter, Tucker is distraught.
 
 Preston takes her findings to Knox, concerned that Tucker poses a threat to
 security. The medics remove the stigma from Tucker's arm. As she recovers
 relieved that the nD flesh has been taken away, Knox and Preston ask her to
 remove herself from duty. She refuses to stop her work.
 
 Radcliffe has alerted local police stations to be on the lookout for Friday,
 telling them simply that he is AWOL. Friday reaches Kirkhaven just as local
 policewoman, DS Rebecca Holland is alerted. Friday cuts open his arms and
 plunges into the reservoir, bleeding to death in the water, infecting the
 supply to the town.
 
 Plans to capture an nD are put into action. Terrell has refused to be of any
 assistance, thinking the plan insane but an impassioned plea from Tucker
 brings him round.
 
 In Kirkhaven, people start to fall ill with bizarre symptoms. Local GP, Dr.
 John Vickers examines Jenny Marchant, one of the townspeople with the disease,
 and is baffled.
 
 Preparations for the capture attempt are finalised. Nick is dismayed when he
 realises that it isn't a peaceful attempt to communicate. Reece gives the
 order to transmit the signal that is part of the trap. When the nD finally
 comes it causes havoc and there are fatalities. Just as they gather themselves
 after the attack the nDs return, ignoring the chance to harm Tucker and taking
 Terrell. He screams that they can't take him alive. Drake kills him with a
 single shot to the head. It is a devastating blow.
 
 The next morning, Tucker is dismayed to find the nD tissue regrowing on her
 arm. After what happened the night before, she is devastated to think that the
 nDs still have some purpose for her. Drake stands by her.
 
 In Kirkhaven, Vickers has alerted the Department of Public Health about the
 unexplained epidemic. Friday's body is found and Holland calls Vickers in.
 
 Preston cannot offer any reassurance this time and Tucker realises the truth
 about what is happening to her. She is anguished and angry and rejects Drake,
 telling him that everything that has happened is his fault. He is devastated.

 Preston works feverishly on developing a toxin. Finally, she succeeds in a
 test tube test. In Kirkhaven, Dr. Vickers has been working flat out treating
 the townspeople. Shortly after he leaves the very ill Jenny Marchant, she is
 abducted by the nDs.
 
 An elated Preston reports her findings to Reece. They need a living subject to
 test it on. Tucker volunteers herself, despite Drakes protests.
 
 DS Holland makes the connection between Friday and the body in the reservoir.
 She calls Radcliffe to identify him. Preston and Stewart begin to examine him,
 realising that he must have been carrying something in his blood.
 
 Jenny Marchant is returned by the nDs, confused, but otherwise seeming
 healthy. An examination reveals that someone has accessed her veins. Both
 Vickers and Holland draw a blank. Tucker and Drake head for Kirkhaven. Preston
 is receiving regular samples from Tucker on which she is conducting trials of
 potential nD toxins. Working together, they deduce what is happening: the
 disease was carried by Friday and spread via the water. It causes the
 increased production of serotonin in the infected person, which causes the
 side effects that manifest themselves in symptoms of the illness. Marchant was
 'cured' because the nDs drained off the serotonin. The terrible truth dawns on
 Tucker - the nDs are farming us. They need our brain chemicals to run their
 advanced biotechnology. She is to be part of this plan as well - a shepherd to
 mind the giant farm.
 
 Alone, Drake and Tucker digest what they have learned. She rejects him again,
 terrified of what she may be turning into. As he wanders pensively through
 Kirkhaven he meets Holland, who invites him home with her. In their
 conversation, it emerges that there is a shortage of men in Kirkhaven. This
 registers with Drake and he calls Radcliffe to check out the statistics.
 Holland tries to seduce him, but all he can think about is Tucker and he runs
 back to her. She is moved to see him and they make love.
 
 Radcliffe finds that the population statistics are relevant. The nDs have been
 manipulating the gender of selected communities, of which Kirkhaven is only
 one, feminising them in an attempt to produce humans who could be made to
 reproduce asexually.
 
 Nick manages to invent a detector that gives advance warning of an nD portal
 about to open. Delighted with this edge, Knox pushes Reece to give the order
 to move in on Kirkhaven. Reece is reluctant and his team realise that they
 haven't got the reinforcements they need. In Kirkhaven, Tucker and Drake
 realise that the toxin is working. Her stigma is finally starting to heal as
 normal human flesh. The toxin is manufactured and loaded into ammunition. With
 the twin advantages of the toxin and the detector, the unit moves in on
 Kirkhaven, repelling the nDs as they come for the townspeople. After the
 attack, there is silence, and the toxin appears to be working.
 
 Preston proposes a sure fire means of getting the toxin to the whole of the nD
 civilisation: delivering it to them via the infected townspeople. Reluctantly,
 Reece gives the order for her to proceed. Reece calls Bentley in again to
 witness the nDs coming back for the townspeople. He is convinced and orders
 reinforcements to be sent.
 
 After a still night, they dare to believe that the toxin is working. As they
 wait, Nick's detector blips. The signal goes off the scale. Dismayed, they
 look out to see that a vast, threatening structure - a lacuna, has appeared
 above the town. The nDs have stepped up their campaign again.

 On seeing the nD structure, Tucker realises that Preston's toxin has not
 worked and that the process she is undergoing will continue. Bentley now has
 the proof he needs and artillery is in place to attack the phenomenon. Reece
 argues that they need time to investigate the lacuna, that force will not
 work, but Bentley feels he has no option and orders a futile strike to go
 ahead, causing Reece to pull Tucker, Drake and the team out of the area before
 they can gather all the data they are after. When it becomes apparent that the
 strike has not worked, Bentley hands control back to Reece, acknowledging that
 his people are the experts and our only line of defence.
 
 When Tucker and Drake are ordered back to Field HQ, Nick makes a case for
 staying near the phenomenon. He has picked up some unfamiliar readings and
 needs to investigate them further. When he realises that it must be nD
 communication, he is excited by the chance this offers and without clearance,
 heads back to gather more data. He makes a fatal attempt to communicate.
 
 Tucker volunteers herself to Preston for tests - understanding the process she
 is undergoing may be the key to beating the nDs. Preston is as professional as
 ever, although she is, by now, straining to keep her faith in science's
 ability to provide answers. Drake is distraught by the knowledge that the
 changes in Tucker are irreversible.
 
 Working from the limited data they gathered in the vicinity of the lacuna,
 Tucker and Drake realise that objects entering it leave a channel behind them
 from which information can be received. In the absence of a more sophisticated
 probe, they resolve to attach instrumentation to a plane and fly it in. Reece
 must decide between Drake and Knox to act as pilot. The job falls to Knox, who
 sends back useful data before being lost in action.
 
 Preston has been analysing the progress of nD cell's in Tucker's body and
 realises that non-living matter is an obstacle to them. This, together with
 results from samples taken around the lacuna, leads her reluctantly towards
 the idea that denying the nDs access to living matter is the only thing that
 will stop them. Taking into account the energy of the structure, Tucker works
 out how much ground will need to be scorched - only a nuclear device is
 powerful enough. As she works, Tucker realises that she will have to be
 eliminated as well.
 
 Naturally there is some urgency to finding an alternative to this drastic
 action. Tucker finds that the structure of the nD matrix extends to higher
 dimensions. More of them could be about to appear at prepared sites throughout
 the planet. Her calculations show that a small release of energy at a critical
 point inside the lacuna will destabilise the whole structure. Tucker and Drake
 make practice runs on a simulator rigged up using the telemetry from Knox's
 flight. Her insights are precise and far reaching - she is starting to think
 like an nD. Desperate to assert her humanity, she makes love to Drake.
 
 Eventually Drake and Tucker make the run and when the phenomenon starts to
 disintegrate, it seems that their mission has been a success. But as soon as
 they escape, another one appears, folded down from a higher dimension. They
 realise that nD resources are practically infinite. Scorched earth, is the
 only option. We have to show the nDs that we would rather wipe out our own
 species than give ourselves over to them. Tucker realises that she must
 sacrifice herself to be free. As the order to deploy a nuclear weapon comes
 through, Tucker goes to Kirkhaven. She smiles as she is enveloped by the
 blast. It is the only way, but she has beaten them.
