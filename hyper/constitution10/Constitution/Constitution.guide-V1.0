             The guide to US constitutional law. v1.0
                   (C) 1996 by Stephen Savner

 Everything you ever wanted to know about how and why the United States
government was set up like it is. 

 Within the Constitution in this guide, you will find links to excerpts 
from a book called "Your rugged Constitution" and a few links to pictures
of certain documents and places of interest.

 There is also the complete text to the Declaration of Independance,
written by Thomas Jefferson between June 11th and June 28th, 1776.

 You can find all of the credits and thank you's inside the @{"Guide-Credits" Link 5.}
section. Please look in the @{"Copyrights" Link 5.1.} section for notices of Copyrights
for this guide compilation, the book "Your rugged Constitution", as
well as other things in this guide.

 You may also want to look in the @{"Future" Link 6.} section for what to expect in
the future. Also, please look in the @{"Instructions" Link 7.} section for
instructions on using this guide with AmigaGuide instead of Multiview.

 Please note that this guide is not meant to be "all encompassing", just
to introduce you to the document that is responsible for the freedoms and
rights that we enjoy as citizens of the United States of America.

 I hope that this guide is helpful to you in understanding how our govt.
works, and why it was set up the way it is. It is also my hope that people 
will become more informed, by this work, to their rights and responsibilities
in keeping these United States a free country.

Sincerly:
Stephen L. Savner

                                   THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE


                  Action of Second Continental Congress, July 4, 1776 The unanimous
                        Declaration of the thirteen United States  of America

                           WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes 
                      necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands 
                        which have connected them with another, and to assume 
                        among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal 
                       Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God 
                          entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of 
                        Mankind requires that they should declare the causes 
                                 which impel them to the Separation.

                          WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all 
                        Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their 
                         Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among 
                       these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness -- 
                       That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted 
                      among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of 
                         the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government 
                        becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of 
                       the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute 
                            new Government, laying its Foundation on such 
                       Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as 
                        to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety 
                         and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that 
                       Governments long established should not be changed for 
                           light and transient Causes; and accordingly all 
                      Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to 
                          suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right 
                        themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are 
                          accustomed.  But when a long Train of Abuses and 
                          Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, 
                           evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute 
                      Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw 
                      off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their 
                       future Security.  Such has been the patient Sufferance 
                       of these Colonies; and such is now the Necessity which 
                          constrains them to alter their former Systems of 
                        Government.  The History of the present King of Great-
                            Britain is a History of repeated Injuries and 
                            Usurpations, all having in direct Object the 
                      Establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  
                       To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid World.

                             HE has refused his Assent to Laws, the most 
                             wholesome and necessary for the public Good.

                           HE has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of 
                       immediate and pressing Importance, unless suspended in 
                       their Operation till his Assent should be obtained; and 
                      when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to 
                                                them.

                              HE has refused to pass other Laws for the 
                      Accommodation of large Districts of People, unless those 
                       People would relinquish the Right of Representation in 
                          the Legislature, a Right inestimable to them, and 
                                     formidable to Tyrants only.

                         HE has called together Legislative Bodies at Places 
                       unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the Depository 
                          of their public Records, for the sole Purpose of 
                          fatiguing them into Compliance with his Measures.

                         HE has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, 
                        for opposing with manly Firmness his Invasions on the 
                                        Rights of the People.

                             HE has refused for a long Time, after such 
                      Dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the 
                       Legislative Powers, incapable of the Annihilation, have 
                       returned to the People at large for their exercise; the 
                         State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the 
                        Dangers of Invasion from without, and the Convulsions 
                                               within.

                           HE has endeavoured to prevent the Population of 
                       these States; for that Purpose obstructing the Laws for 
                      Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to 
                         encourage their Migrations hither, and raising the 
                              Conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

                         HE has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by 
                       refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary 
                                               Powers.

                         HE has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for 
                       the Tenure of their Offices, and the Amount and Payment 
                                          of their Salaries.

                         HE has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent 
                      hither Swarms of Officers to harrass our People, and eat 
                                         out their Substance.

                          HE has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing 
                           Armies, without the consent of our Legislatures.

                         HE has affected to render the Military independent 
                                 of and superior to the Civil Power.

                           HE has combined with others to subject us to a 
                            Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and 
                       unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Assent to their 
                                    Acts of pretended Legislation:

                          FOR quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among 
                                                 us;

                             FOR protecting them, by a mock Trial, from 
                       Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on 
                                   the Inhabitants of these States:

                           FOR cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the 
                                                World:

                            FOR imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

                         FOR depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of 
                                            Trial by Jury:

                           FOR transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for 
                                         pretended Offences:

                         FOR abolishing the free System of English Laws in a 
                      neighbouring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary 
                         Government, and enlarging its Boundaries, so as to 
                         render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for 
                       introducing the same absolute Rules into these Colonies:

                          FOR taking away our Charters, abolishing our most 
                       valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of 
                                           our Governments:

                         FOR suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring 
                        themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in 
                                        all Cases whatsoever.

                          HE has abdicated Government here, by declaring us 
                           out of his Protection and waging War against us.

                           HE has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, 
                       burnt our Towns, and destroyed the Lives of our People.

                          HE is, at this Time, transporting large Armies of 
                         foreign Mercenaries to compleat the Works of Death, 
                             Desolation, and Tyranny, already begun with 
                           circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely 
                         paralleled in the most barbarous Ages, and totally 
                               unworthy the Head of a civilized Nation.

                            HE has constrained our fellow Citizens taken 
                         Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their 
                      Country, to become the Executioners of their Friends and 
                           Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

                          HE has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, 
                       and has endeavoured to bring on the Inhabitants of our 
                        Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known 
                       Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of 
                                   all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.

                             IN every stage of these Oppressions we have 
                        Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms:  Our 
                       repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated 
                        Injury.  A Prince, whose Character is thus marked by 
                       every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the 
                                       Ruler of a free People.

                            NOR have we been wanting in Attentions to our 
                      British Brethren.  We have warned them from Time to Time 
                            of Attempts by their Legislature to extend an 
                        unwarrantable Jurisdiction over us.  We have reminded 
                           them of the Circumstances of our Emigration and 
                         Settlement here.  We have appealed to their native 
                        Justice and Magnanimity, and we have conjured them by 
                           the Ties of our common Kindred to disavow these 
                         Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our 
                      Connections and Correspondence.  They too have been deaf 
                       to the Voice of Justice and of Consanguinity.  We must, 
                       therefore, acquiesce in the Necessity, which denounces 
                        our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of 
                             Mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends.

                          WE, therefore, the Representatives of the UNITED 
                         STATED OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS, Assembled, 
                         appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the 
                        Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and by 
                      Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly 
                      Publish and Declare, That these United Colonies are, and 
                       of Right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that 
                        they are absolved from all Allegiance to the British 
                        Crown, and that all political Connection between them 
                         and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought to be 
                         totally dissolved; and that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT 
                         STATES, they have full Power to levy War, conclude 
                      Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do 
                      all other Acts and Things which INDEPENDENT STATES may of 
                      right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with 
                       a firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence, 
                           we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our 
                                   Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

@NODE 3.1.1. "Perfect union"

                     To form a more perfect union

 Our country won it's independance from Great Britain in the year 1781.
For eight years after that, this country was governed under a constitution
called the Articles of confederation. But there were faults in the
articles. The United States of America, in spite of it's name, was far
from being a "perfect Union". It was instead, as the articles said, a
"league of friendship" among the states.

 In time, some of the states became less friendly toward one another. Soon
they began to quarrel seriously. Instead of pulling together as a team,
the states were pulling in different directions. There was a danger that
the states might break away and become small separate countries.

 The nation's leaders feared that our new country might fail. For this
reason they called a cenvention of citizens from the various states to
meet and study these problems. This group of citizens, now called the
Constitutional Convention, began it's meetings in May of 1787 at
@{"Independance Hall" link "pics/hall.gif/main"0} in Philadelphia. All the men were leaders in their
states. Among them were such famous citizens as George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, and James Madison. --- See @{"Signitures" Link 0.7.}.

 For a while the delegates to the Convention tried to patch up the
Articles of Confederation and make them work. But they soon decided to
make an entirely new plan of government in order to form "a more perfect
Union." On September 17, 1787, they put their plan into final form and
signed it. They had written the Constitution of the United States of
America--the plan for our government.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.1.2. "Establish justice"

                        To establish justice

 Our Constitution tells us how our laws are to be passed and how our
courts are to be run so that every citizen will get the same fair
treatment from the government. Laws and punishments are the same for
everyone.

 When the Constitution was written, there were injustices in the world
that would seem strange to us today. In some countries, for example,
nobles were tried in their own special courts under special laws. Kings
sometimes ordered people to be executed without a trial. As you will see,
the men who wrote our constitution took care that injustices like these
should not be allowed in the United States.

 But more than that, these farsighted men gave us a system of laws and
courts that protect us from newer kinds of injustice. In some countries
today, governments give people unfair trials in order to rob them of their
property, to sentance them to slave labor camps, or even to execute them.
But "We the People of the United States" have ordered the there shall be
no unfair trials or unfair punishments in this country. Every American
citizen enjoys "equal justice under law."

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.1.3. "Domestic tranquility"

                   To insure domestic tranquility

 Before the Constitution was adopted, the United States government had
little power to help keep the country peaceful and orderly. After the War
for Independance, times were hard. Here and there, some people rebelled
against their state governments, and the national government lacked power
to help the states. Nor did the government have power to settle disputes
between the states, even when these disputes threatened to turn into real
warfare.

 The Constitution settled such problems as these and has protected our
"domestic tranquility" ever since. People now can live without fear of
violence. When disagreements arise between states, the states let the
national government settle their disagreements justly. If a rebellion
should occur, the government has the power to step in and enforce the laws
of the country and protect the lives and property of the people.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.1.4. "Common defense"

                         The common defense

 Our government must do more than keep things peacful at home. It must
also be strong enough to keep enemy nations from conquering this land and
taking away our property and lives. There are several clauses in 
the Constitution that allow our government to take care of the country's
changing needs for an army and navy to protect us against a foreign
attack.

 The United States loves peace and works within the United Nations and in
many other ways to keep the peace in the world. But we have the strength
to fight hard against our enimies, whether they threaten all the states or
only one of them. This is called "the common defence."

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.1.5. "General welfare"

                         The general welfare

 This phrase states one of the most important ideals of the American
people.

 When we speak of a person's welfare we mean his health, happiness, and
prosperity. "The general welfare" means the health, happiness, and
prosperity of everyone. When neighbors help neighbors, they are promoting
the general welfare.

 The makers of the Constitution planned for the government also to promote
the general welfare. But they ordered the government to do things that
would benifit everyone, and not to help any one person or group of persons
at the expense of all the rest--as many foreign governments had done and
some still do.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.1.6. "Liberty"

                    To secure the blessings of liberty

 In 1787, the English colonies in America had already won their liberty
and had been states for several years. But Washington, Franklin, Madison,
and the others at the Constitutional Convention wished to preserve this
liberty so that their posterity might have liberty too.

 The Constitution they wrote helps to preserve two kinds of liberty for
all of us. First is the liberty of the country, protected against control
by foreign countries. Second is the liberty of Americans, guarded from
being ruled over unjustly by other Americans who might try to seize the 
government.

 This liberty we enjoy does not make any of us free to do whatever he
wants to do whenever he wants to do it. Our liberty does not give us the
right to take away the lives and property of others. If that were allowed,
one man's liberty would mean another man's loss of liberty. Like justice,
liberty must be equal for everybody.

@NODE 3.2.1. "Congress"
                        ARTICLE I SECTION ONE

 Article one, section one, of the Constitution sets up the legislative, 
or lawmaking, branch of the United States government. This branch is called 
"the Congress". The legislative branch is one of the three branches which 
the planners of the Constitution created to make sure that there would be a
seperation of powers in our government.

 The legislative branch is the only branch of government with the power to
make United States laws. The other two branches may only suggest laws to
Congress. But even Congress is allowed to make only those kinds of laws
which the Constitution says Congress may make.

 The legislative branch is made up of the @{"House" Link 3.2.2.} of Representatives and
the @{"Senate" Link 3.2.3.}.

 The Congress meets in the @{"Capital building" link "pics/capital.gif/main"0} in Washington D.C..

                             Clause one                      

 In this country, which has a representative government, deciding who
shall be permitted to vote in the various elections is important. The
makers of the Constitution could not agree on who should be allowed to
vote for members of the House of Representatives. They settled the
argument by letting each state make its own rules for electing
Representatives. But the Constitution did order that anyone should be
allowed to vote for a representative if he was allowed in his own state to
vote for members of "the most numerous branch of the state Legislature."
In most states, the branch of the Legislature with more members was also
the branch elected by more of the people.

 This Clause also ordered that Representatives must be elected every two 
years.

                            Clause two

 This orders that no one that is not an inhabitant of the state from which 
he is elected for the House of Representatives, or has not atained the age 
of 25, or is not an citizen of the United States for atleast 7 years, shall
be allowed to become a Representative.

                            Clause three

 This clause orders that a Census must be taken every ten years, and the
results of that census will determine how many Representatives each state
will be allowed to send to Congress.

                            Clause four

 This orders any state Governer to order a special election to replace a
Representative if that Representative should die or resign from office.

                            Clause five

 Sets up the leader of the House of Representatives, called "The Speaker
of the House". He is third in line for the office of the President in case
of the death of the President and Vice-President.

 The words "sole power of impeachment" in this clause mean that only the
House of Representatives has the right to accuse a public official of the
United States of some important crimes or misdemeanors.

                        ARTICLE I SECTION THREE

                              Clause one

 This clause is a part of the "great Compromise". The states with small
populations were afraid that the states with large populations might
control Congress and pass laws that the smaller states did not like. But
this clause removed their fears. Every state, no matter how small, would
have two Senators to guard it's interests. Senators from the small states
could vote together to defeat any unfair bill passed by the House, in
which the large states had more members.


                             Clause two

 The six-year terms of one-third of the Senators end every two years. Then
new Senators must be elected to take their places. Two-thirds of the
members of the Senate, however, are "carried over". Thus, the Senate is
sometimes called "the house that never dies."


                             Clause three

 This clause makes sure that all Senators are:

 1- At least thirty years old.
 2- A citizen of the United States for at least nine years.
 3- A resident of the state in which he is elected.


                             Clause four

 The only duty assigned to the Vice-President by the Constitution is 
to be the president of the Senate. this duty is important. When there is a tie
vote in the Senate, the Vice-President can vote and break the tie.

 As president of the Senate, he learns about new bills and laws,
appointments of important officials, and treaties with other nations. He
needs to understand these things in case he should suddenly become
President of the United States.


                             Clause five

 The Senate elects all its officers except its president, who is the
Vice-President of the United States. If the Vice-President is absent or
has become the President of the United States, the president pro tempore
(or "pro tem") of the Senate serves in his place.


                             Clause six

 When a government offical is accused of a crime, the House of
Representatives charges him with that crime by voting to impeach him. The
Senate alone is allowed to decide whether he is innocent or guilty. 

 If the President of the United States is to be tried, the Chief Justice
of the United States, not the Vice-President, presides over the Senate.

 The Constitution orders that the accused person shall be considered
innocent unless two-thirds of the Senators present agree that he is
guilty.


                            Clause seven

 This clause gives rules for punishing an impeached official if he is
found guilty. The Senate can punish him only by taking his position away
and forbidding him ever to hold any other position in the federal
government. If the Senate could punish him more severely, he would be 
losing his right to a jury trial.

 After his trial by the Senate, the official may still be tried in a
regular court and be given the usual punishments for his crimes.

 All states except one hold Congressional elections on the Tuesday after
the first Monday in November of even-numbered years. Maine holds its
elections in September.

 The Constitution leaves nearly all election regulations to the states.
However, it allows Congress to pass certain laws to safeguard the honesty
and fairness of national elections. One law requires that secret ballots
be used. Another law limits the amount of money that candidates for the
Senate and the House may spend during campaigns for election.


                              Clause two

 The kings of European countries sometimes kept their legislatures from
holding regular meetings. This clause make sure that Congress shall not be
kept from meeting regularly and will not neglect its duties.

 @{"Amendment XX" Link 0.8.20.}, Section two, orders that the new Congress shall meet on 
January 3 of each odd-numbered year following the regular november elections. 
This is called the first session of that particular Congress. Congress meets

 Sometimes persons have been elected to Congress in dishonest ways, or
have failed to meet the requirements ordered by the Constitution. That
is why this Clause gives each house of Congress the right to decide by a
vote of the majority whether to keep any person from becoming a member of
that house.

 The same clause also says that each house can do business whenever it has
a "quorum". That is, when more than half its members are present. But, in
practice, each house often carries on business even though fewer than half
its members are present. This can be done provided that none of the
members present objects to the lack of a quorum.

 Clause 3 directs Congress to keep a journal, or daily record, of its
work. It does this by three official publications. the Senate has the
"Senate Journal"; the House has the "House Journal". Both are published
at the end of each session of Congress. Congress as a whole has "The
Congressional Record". For many years it has been published every day that
Congress has been in session. "The Congressional Record" helps Congressmen
to keep track of their work and gives the people a chance to study the

 The Constitution gives members of Congress salaries, expenses, and
other compensations; freedom from arrest for ordinary reasons while doing

 This orders that no member of Congress, during his elected term,
can take any United States government job which was either created or
given a higher salary during his term in Congress; and anybody working in 
a United States government job must give up that job before becoming a
member of Congress.

 Most bills are passed if a majority in each house of Congress votes for
them. The Constitution names some exceptions, including vetoed bills,
for which more than a majority is needed.

 These two clauses give the President the right to approve or veto all
bills, and the Congress the task of persuading two-thirds of its members to
vote for any bill that has been vetoed by the President. 

 This gives the people protection from hasty and unwise actions by either 
the Congress or the President.

                        ARTICLE I SECTION EIGHT

                              Clause one

 This clause gives Congress the general power to collect taxes. Congress
raises money by two kinds of taxes--direct taxes and indirect taxes.
Direct taxes are explained in the Constitution, @{"Article I" Link 0.1.}, Section 2,
Clause 3.

 The indirect taxes which Congress may collect include taxes on goods from
foreign countries. These are called duties or imposts. Another indirect
tax is the excise tax. This is a tax on the manufacture and sale of many
articles within the country, on certain business transactions, and so on.
An indirect tax, unlike a direct tax, may be passed along from one person
to another. A manufacturer pays the government a tax on an article, but
includes that tax in the price he charges the wholesaler. The wholesaler
includes that tax in the price he charges the retailer. Finally you, the
consumer, pay the tax as part of the price of the article.

 Indirect taxes must be the same throughout the country. A federal tax on
cars, for example, shall be the same in San Francisco as it is in New York
and Kansas City.

                             Clause three

 The first part of this clause gives Congress complete power over trade
between the United States and foreign countries. Using this authority,
Congress has passed laws applying to goods entering or leaving the
country, ships and other means of transportation and communications, and
foreign people who may come to the United States.

 Under this broad power, all our laws which apply to foreign trade are
made by the federal government. This keeps the states from getting us into

 This clause gives Congress the power to decide which foreign born
persons may become citizens of the United States, and how they may do so.

 It also gives Congress the power to pass laws which protect both an
individual who owes more money that he can pay and those to whom he owes
it.

 A bill of attainder is a law passed by a legislature to punish a person

which an unjust government sometimes punishes a person who disagrees with
it.

 "Ex post facto" is a Latin phrase meaning "after the deed." An ex post
facto law is one that punishes people for earlier actions of theirs that
were not crimes before the law was passed. Under this clause, if a law is
passed today, it may not be used to punish a person for something they did

 Agreements, or compacts, between states, made with the permission of

 This clause give all executive powers to the President of the United
States of America. It also limits his, and the Vice-President's term 
to four years, at which time they must run for re-election.

 The Vice-President of the United States is first in line to succeed the
President if he should die or otherwise become unable to execute his
duties under the Constitution.

 The only power granted to the Vice-President by the Constitution is the
duty of "President of the Senate". As the President of the Senate, his
only duty is to vote to break a tie vote in that house. This is the only
time that he is allowed to vote on any bill that is up for consideration
in that house.    <---See @{"Senate" Link 3.2.3.} Clause four.

 Directs each state to choose a number of "electors" equal to the total
number of Senators and Representatives from that state, for the purpose of
electing the President of the United States. It also orders that no
Senator or Representative from that state shall serve as an elector.

 These electors make up what is called the "Electoral College".

                        ARTICLE II SECTION ONE

                             Clause three

 According to the original plan in the Constitution, the votes from the
Electorial College were to be counted in Congress and the person with
the most votes was to be President. The person with the next most votes
was to be @{"Vice-President" Link 3.3.2.}. But changes were soon made in this plan. 
@{"Amendment XII" Link 0.8.12.}, adopted in 1804, ruled that the electors must show which
man they wanted for President and which for Vice-President.

 Early in the 1800's, our present system of political parties began. This
system brought about a still more important change in the presidential
elections. The change was never put into the Constitution, but came about
as a result of custom.

 The writers of the Constitution intended that the Electoral College
should give careful thought to choosing the best man in the country as
President. But when the political parties became powerful, the leaders of
each party in Congress decided who should be that party's candidate for
President. Each party then got various groups of electors to promise to
vote for its candidate.

 After 1830, political leaders from all parts of the country began meeting
every four years in national party conventions. At its convention each
party chose men to be its candidates for President and Vice-President. It
also decided on the party's "platform"--that is, a statement of what its
candidates would do if they were elected.

 That was how our present customs for presidential elections began. On the
ballot, you actually vote for the electors belonging to your party; you do
not vote for the candidates themselves. But this makes no real difference,
since an elector never breaks his promise to vote for his party's
candidates.

 In 1886, Congress had passed a law which said that if both the
President and the @{"Vice-President" Link 3.3.2.} died, the presidency should go to the
Secretary of State and then to the other members of the President's
Cabinet in a certain order. This would have ment that the presidency would
go to a person apppointed by the President, not to a person elected by the
people. In 1947, therfore, Congress changed the Law of Presidential
Succession to read that the Vice-President should be followed by the
Speaker of the House of Representatives and then by the president pro-
tempore of the Senate. Both of these are elected officers of the
government. If all four of the elected officers should die, not very
likely, then the Cabinet officers would be in line for the presidency.

 This gives us a President who is free to do what he thinks is right;

                        ARTICLE II SECTION II

                             Clause one

 When the makers of the Constitution made the President commander in chief
of the armed forces, they were thinking of several important points;

 1. They ordered that the head of the armed forces should be elected by the
   people.

 2. They prevented any military officer of the armed forces from seizing
   the government and making himself President.

 3. They also prevented any President from becoming a dictator, since he
   can be head of the armed forces only as long as he is President--and a
   President can be impeached or voted out of office.

 4. They placed in the hands of one man the great governmental and military
   powers that must be used together in time of war.

 In this clause, the words "principal officer in each of the executive
departments" suggest that there will be various departments to help the
President carry out his duties. The heads of these departments have come
to be known as the President's Cabinet.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.3.11. "Ambassadors"
                        ARTICLE II SECTION II

                             Clause two

 A treaty is an agreement between two or more countries. Usually our State
Department works out and writes the agreement. After the President has
approved the treaty, he must send it to the Senate. There, at least
two-thirds of the Senators must agree to the treaty before it becomes law.
This rule keeps the President from making important agreements with other
nations against the wishes of the elected representatives of the American
people. But there are other kinds of foreign agreements, less important
than treaties, which the President can make without the Senate's approval.

 In this clause, the Constitution makes separate rules for selecting two
different kinds of officers:

 1. Very important officers who are appointed by the President only after
a majority of the Senate has approved them:

 2. And inferior officers who can be chosen by the President, by his
Cabinet officers, or by judges without asking the Senate to approve them.
These so-called "inferior officers" are not neccessarily unimportant.

 If one of these important jobs becomes vacant while the Congress is not
meeting, the President may choose a person for the job without waiting to
get the Senate's permission. Such an appointment is known as an interim,
or "for the interval," appointment. When Congress meets again, the Senate
votes either for or against the person chosen by the President.

 It is treason for a citizen of the United States to make war against this

money in return for special favors from the government. The "other high

 The judicial branch, and especially the Supreme Court, has the power to

 Certain cases, such as those concerning states or official
representatives of foreign nations, are not tried in the lower federal
courts. Instead they go at once to the Supreme Court. This is called the
"original jurisdiction" of the Supreme Court.

 Most other federal cases begin and end in the district courts, of which
there is at least one in every state. But the Supreme Court has the right
to look over the records of all such cases and to change the decision of
the lower courts. A case that has been tried in a local court, state
court, or lower federal court may also be taken to the Supreme Court. This
is called an "appeal of the case". The right of the Supreme Court to
review decisions of other courts is called its "appellate jurisdiction".
Since there are so many cases that are appealed that the Supreme Court
could not possibly hear them all, many of them are handled by the United

 The men who wrote the Constitution knew that, as the nation grew, future
citizens would have very different problems than they faced. That is why
they wrote Article 5. Because of this article, changes in the Constitution
can be made when neccessary.

 There are two main steps that must be taken to amend the Constitution.
These are, first, the proposal of the amendment and, second, approval by
the states.

 Amendments may be proposed in two ways:

 1. By a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House.
 2. In a national convention called by Congress when asked to do so by the
    legislatures of two-thirds of the states.

 Approval by the states of an amendment, called ratification, may also be
obtained in two ways:

 1. By the legislatures of the states.
 2. By special conventions called in the states.

 Congress decides which method of ratification shall be used. If
three-fourths of the states approve the amendment, by either method, it
becomes a part of the Constitution.

 Article five concludes "that no state, without its consent, shall be
deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate". This means that every state
shall always be allowed to have two Senators in Congress. Unless the state
gives its permission, no amendment can ever be made that would take away its

gevernment, each with certain powers.

 When the powers of government are split up like this, local laws
sometimes disagree with state laws, and state laws with federal laws. Then
there has to be some way of deciding which group of laws should be obeyed.

 After the Constitutional Convention, the Constitution was sent to
Congress. In the debate which followed, @{"John Adams" link "pics/john-adams.gif/main"0} said, "Our people must

upon the broadest foundations." Adams wanted to be sure that the nations                 
government would be built to suit the wishes of the people.

 In September 1787, Congress sent copies of the Constitution to the
thirteen states for ratification. Within a year, eleven states ratified
the famous document, making it the supreme law of the land.

 George Washington became the first President in 1789. Before the summer
of 1790, all thirteen states had ratified the Constitution. As members of
a strong union, they had promised to build a new government for all the
nations citizens.

 But there were many people who feared the new government and said that
the Constitution should have more rules protecting the citizens. The first
Congress, therfore, proposed twelve amendments to the states for
ratification. Ten of these, called the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791. 
All states have included sililar bills of rights in their own constitutions.

 It should be noted here that out of the original twelve amendments that
the first Congress proposed, only ten were ratified in 1791, one was

@NODE 3.9.2. "To keep and bear arms"
                            Amendment II

                          Adopted in 1791

 This Amendment was written to deny the federal government the power to
interfere with your right to own and bear arms for lawful purposes.

 There was a fear that a strong national army might try to take over the
government by force and do away with the peoples rights. If such a thing
were to happen, this amendment makes sure that there will be a strong,
well armed militia of the people to insure that it does not succeed.

@NODE 3.9.3. "Quartered"
                            Amendment III

                           Adopted in 1791

 Before the Revolution, the British government often made the American
colonists take soldiers into their homes and give them food and a place to
sleep. The people bitterly resented this, and made up their minds that the 
new government should never have this right, even in time of war, except
according to law.

@NODE 3.9.4. "Unreasonable searches"
                            Amendment IV

                           Adopted in 1791

 This amendment denies the right to any federal, state, or local officer
to arrest you or search your home or other property unless he has a warrent
to do so.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.5. "Held to answer"
                            Amendment V

                          Adopted in 1791

 The first half of this amendment means this: The federal government
cannot bring you to trial for a serious crime until a grand jury has
decided that a crime has really been committed, and that you probably
committed it.

NOTE * Capitol crimes are those which may be punished by death. Infamous
       crimes are those which may be punished by more than one year in
       prison.

 The rest of this amendment names certain other things that the federal
government cannot do:

 1. If you have been tried and found not guilty, the government cannot try
    you again for the same crime.

 2. When you are being tried for a crime, the government cannot force you
    to say anything to injure yourself.

 3. The government cannot execute or imprison you, or take away your
    property, except according to fair methods under the law.

 4. If the government needs your property for some good reason, it must
    pay you a fair price for this property.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.6. "Public trial"
                            Amendment VI

                           Adopted in 1791

 This amendment describes certain rights which the federal government must
give you if you are arrested on a criminal charge. You must have:

 1. A public trial as soon as possible after being arrested.

 2. A jury of fair-minded citizens (usually twelve) who live near the
    place where you are supposed to have committed the crime.

 3. Information telling you just what you are supposed to have done, so
    that you can prepare your defense.

 4. A chance to see, hear, and answer the witnesses who speak against you.

 5. The help of the government, if neccessary, in bringing to court
    witnesses who can help you.

 6. A lawyer to defend you, paid for by the government if you are unable
    to pay him.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.7. "Common law"
                           Amendment VII

                          Adopted in 1791

 This amendment refers to cases usually called "civil suits". Such cases
deal with disagreements about persons' rights and duties toward one
another. When a civil case is tried in a federal court, the persons in the
case may have a jury trial. But no jury is needed if the persons agree to
do without one or if the money in the case is $20 or less.

 When a case has been taken from a lower to a higher court, the judge or
judges of the higher court may change the decision of the jury in the
lower court only if:

 1. The exact meaning of the law was not understood correctly in the
    lower court.

 2. Or if the jury made its decision without hearing enough proofs of the
    facts.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.8. "Excessive bail"
                            AMENDMENT VIII

                            Adopted in 1791

 After a person has been arrested, he is usually allowed to leave the jail
until his trial. But before he leaves, he or someone else has to hand over
money or other property to the court. This is called "bail". The bail is
given back when the accused person comes to court to be tried. This
amendment rules that federal judges must not ask for unfair amounts of
bail. It also rules that people convicted of crime shall not be tortured,
nor be fined or imprisoned more than is fair.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.9. "The enumeration"
                            AMENDMENT IX

                           Adopted in 1791

 The first eight amendments listed certain rights belonging to the people.
Those rights were so clearly described that the federal government could
make no mistake about them. It was not possible, however, to list all the
rights which the people wanted to keep for themselfs. Amendment nine was
added so that the federal government would not try to take away people's
rights simply because those rights were not named in the Constitution.

 Basicly, this amendment denies the federal government any control over
rights not listed in the Constitution.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.10. "The powers not delegated"
                            AMENDMENT X

                          Adopted in 1791

 "Powers not delegated...are reserved...to the people."

 Those words are of great importance. They were put into the Constitution
because many leading Americans believed that "ALL" political power has
always belonged to the people. As @{"John Adams" link "pics/john-adams.gif/main"0} once said, 

"You have rights antecedent to all earthly governments; rights that cannot 
 be repealed or restrained by human laws; rights derived from the Great 
                      Legislator of the Universe." 

 Or, to say it in simpler words:

"The people have rights that come before the rights of the government. The
  people's rights come from God and cannot be taken away by human laws."

 Each state had its own constitution which gave certain powers to the
state government and kept other powers for the people. Under the Articles
of Confederation, the states had given a few of their powers to the
national government. But in the Constitution of the United States, the
people were assigning powers directly to the national government.

 Amendment 10 was added to the Constitution because many people feared
that the new national government might try to use powers it had not been
given. This amendment makes it clear that the federal government was to
have only those powers given to it by the Constitution. Certain powers
were to be kept by the states. All other powers were to be kept by the 
people. These powers kept by the people were not to be used at all unless
the people decided to give them to the federal government by amending the
Constitution.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.11. "The judicial power"
                            AMENDMENT XI

                           Adopted in 1798

 This amendment was added to make clear the meaning of @{"Article III" Link 0.3.},
Section II, Clause I. That clause said that federal courts could try cases
"between a state and citizens of another state". When approving the
Constitution, the states thought this meant:

 1. That a state could bring a citizen of another state into a federal
    court.

 2. And that no state could be brought without its consent into a federal
    court by a citizen of another state.

 When the Supreme Court ruled under Article 3 that a citizen of one state
or a foreign country could sue another state in a federal court, the
states asked for Amendment 11.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.12. "The electors shall meet"
                            AMENDMENT XII

                           Adopted in 1804

 Amendment 12 changes @{"Article II" Link 0.2.}, Section I, Clause III. This amendment 
makes members of the Electorial College vote for a President and a
Vice-President on seperate ballots. The amendment became neccessary after
the election of 1800. By that time political parties had begun to select
canadates. All electors of the Democratic-Republican party voted for
Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. This made a tie vote when the ballots
were counted. Most of these electors wanted Jefferson for President and
Burr for Vice-President. But when the tie vote was sent to the House of
Representatives to be broken, the Federalist party very nearly voted to
make Burr instead of Jefferson the President, against the wishes of the
majority.

 Because of Amendment 12 and the voting customs that grew up when
political parties were formed, all members of the Electorial College now
vote for a President and Vice-President exactly as the popular vote
demands.

 The Constitution did not say what should be done if a President was not
chosen by Inauguration Day. Nor did it say that the Vice-President's
qualifications should be the same as the President's. Amendment 12 made
these and other points clearer.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.13. "Neither slavery"
                            AMENDMENT XIII

                            Adopted in 1865

 This amendment finally ended all slavery and "involuntary servitude"
anywhere in the United States or its territories. Involuntary servitude is
about the same as slavery. In general, Amendment 13 says that no one in
the United States or its possessions may be made to work without pay or as
a prisoner unless he has been found guilty of a crime and is being
punished for it.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.14. "All persons born"
                            AMENDMENT XIV

                           Adopted in 1868

                              SECTION I

 The main purpose of Section i, Amendment 14, was to make citizens of the
former slaves and to keep the states from taking away their rights of
citizenship.

 Section 1 has a wider meaning than it had when it was written. It is now
one of the most important parts of the Constitution. This section says
that persons who were born or naturalized in the United States are
citizens, both of the United States and of the state they live in. It also
orders the states not to take away the rights of United States citizens.

 Most important are the words: "nor shall any state deprive any person of
life, liberty, or property without due process of law". These words have
come to have these meanings:

 1. The states must use fair, legal methods when they try to take away a
person's life, liberty, or property. For example, a man must not be beaten
to make him confess to a crime.

 2. The states must not take away certain kinds of rights and privileges
no matter how leagally it is done. These words are used, for example, to
protect freedom of speach, press, and assembly from interference by the
states.

 The last words of this section mean that whatever rights are given or
rules are make, they must be the same for everyone.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3.9.15. "Respective numbers"
                            AMENDMENT XIV

                           Adopted in 1868

                              Section II

 Before Amendment 14 was adopted, only three-fifths of the Negro slaves
had been counted in the census. The purpose of the census was to find out
how many Representatives each state might send to Congress. But this
amendment ruled that everyone was to be counted except Indians who did not
have to pay taxes.

@NODE 3.9.16. "No person shall"
                            AMENDMENT XIV
                           
                           Adopted in 1868

                             Section III

 Before the War Between the States, many leaders of the Confederacy had
been officials of the United States government or had held offices in
state governments. When those leaders took office they swore oaths to
support the Constitution. After the war, Congress decided that these men
had broken their oaths when they joined or helped the Confederate forces.
Congress, therefore, set out to punish these men by keeping them from
holding public office again.

 Because of this section in Amendment 14, the southern states lost many
of their leaders. But in 1872 Congress ended this punishment for most of
the men who had served the Confederacy. In 1898 all others were finally
pardoned.

                             Section IV

 The first part of section 4 was added so that Congressmen from the
southern states would not try to pass laws to keep the United States
government from paying back the money it had borrowed during the War
Between the States. The second part made certain that neither the federal
government nor the state governments could pay back any money borrowed to
help the Confederacy. confederate bonds and money, of course, became
worthless.

                            AMENDMENT XVI

                           Adopted in 1913

 The Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, but makes
rules as to how this may be done. One rule is that the amount of direct
taxes taken from any state must depend on the number of people in that
state.  <--NOTE * See @{"Article I" Link 0.1.}, Section 9, Clause 4.

 In 1894 Congress passed a law taxing the incomes of the people in all
states. The following year the Supreme Court decided that this income tax
law was unconstitutional. This law, did not take into account the number
of people living in each state.

 The federal government needed the money from the income tax to pay its
growing expenses. For that reason, Amendment 16 was added to the
Constitution. This amendment makes it constitutional for Congress to tax
all kinds of incomes. the federal government now gets more of its money by
taxing incomes than it get in any other way.

 Before 1913, United States Senators were not elected by the voters; 
they were chosen by their state Legislatures. This method gave the voters
little control over the Senate. Besides, the method did not work very
well. For instance, some members of the Legislatures were suspected of
taking bribes to choose certain men as Senators. It was finally decided
that the voters should elect Senators just as they elect Representatives.
Amendment 17 makes this the law of the nation.

 In the early years of our country, women had little chance to take part
in government, and were never allowed to vote. During the 1800's, however,
more and more women began demanding the right to vote. By the early 1900's,
a number of western states were already allowing women to vote. Finally,
in 1920, Amendment 19 gave women in all parts of the country the right to
vote in state and national elections.

@NODE 3.9.23. "The terms of"
                            AMENDMENT XX

                           Adopted in 1933

                              Section I

 When the Constitution was written, it sometimes took weeks for people or
mail to get from one part of the country to another. Because transportation
and communication were so slow, the Constitution ordered that the new
Congressmen and the new President elected in November should not begin
their terms until the next March 4. This allowed them time to learn of
their election and to get to Washington.

 In later years such a long delay after the election was not neccessary.
It was also unwise, for two reasons:

 1. After the voters had chosen the new President, they had to wait about
   four months before he could start doing the things they had elected him to
   do.

 2. Even though the term of newly elected Congressmen began on March 4,
   they did not actually meet in Congress until the first Monday in December
   of the same year.                   <--NOTE * See @{"Article I" Link 0.1.}, Section 4, Clause 2.
   Unless the President called a special session of Congress, more than
   thirteen months went by before the Congressmen could start doing their
   work.

 From December of election year until March 4 of the following year, the
old Congress could continue to sit.

 In the old Congress there were some Senators and Representatives who had
been defeated for re-election. Such members of Congress were called "lame
ducks". It there were many "lame ducks", as sometimes happened, they
could hold back important laws. Or the "lame ducks" could pass laws which
the election had shown the voters did not want.

 Amendment 20 is sometimes called "The Lame Duck Amendment". It orders the
newly elected Congressmen to begin work on January 3, about a month and a
half after the election, and the new President to take office on January 20.

 Amendment 20 also tells what shall be done if a newly elected President
or Vice-President should die or for some other reason should not be able
to take office. It also says what shall be done if a canadate dies while a
close election is being settled in Congress.

 @{"Amendment XVIII" Link 0.8.18.}, the Prohibition Amendment, made it unlawful to make or

@NODE 3.9.25. "More than twice"
                           AMENDMENT XXII

                           Adopted in 1951

 In 1940, when the United States was in danger of being drawn into World
War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as President for the third time.
In 1944, he was elected again. Never before had a President been elected
more than twice. If it had not been for the war, Roosevelt probably would
not have been President for more than two terms. Many Americans have long
believed that two terms are enough for a President.

 After the war this belief was made a law. Amendment 22 keeps any
President from being elected more than twice. It also keeps a
Vice-President or anyone else from being elected to the Presidency more
than once if he has already served more than two years to finish the term
of another President.

 As you can see, this guide is not complete, but it is a "work in progress".
I had hoped to include a section on Supreme Court decisions as they dealt 
with the Constitution, but i have not found a set of books that i can check 
out of the libary, and i do not have the time to do the research on site.

 There is also an omission of comments on Amendments 23 thru 27. The
reason for this is lack of time and reasearch material. The same holds
true for the very few number of quotes and pictures included. If you have 
any pictures of people and places involved in the writing of the Constitution 
in IFF, GIF, or JPEG format, please consider sending them to me for inclusion 
in this guide. Currently there are 11 pictures included, all in GIF format.

 Work on this guide will continue as i can find the time and resources to
do so. I am releasing it unfinished so that i can get feedback and because i
believe it to be finished enough to be useful. 

If you have any ideas, comments, or error corrections, please send them to

 Although i ask nothing for the use of this guide, i do welcome any and
all contributions for the research and time put into the project. If you

 This guide is setup to use Multiview instead of AmigaGuide. The reason
for this are the pictures included within. Multiview is the only way to
view them from within the guide. 

 If you are using WorkBench 3.0 or 3.1, then you have Multiview already
and will need to change nothing. If, however, you are using an older WB
such as 2.1 or 1.3, you will have to change the "default tool" in the
guide's icon from "Multiview" to "AmigaGuide".

 If you must use AmigaGuide then you will be unable to view the pictures
from within the guide by clicking on the "links". You will instead have to
use an external viewer such as ViewTech or SuperView to see them.

 If you use Multiview, the pictures MUST stay in the directory that i have 
created in the archive for the guide to find them. 

 Thats all there is to it. 

Enjoy.
