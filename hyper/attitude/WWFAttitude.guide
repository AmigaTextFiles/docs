Throwing a Wrestler Over the Ropes:
  -To throw a wrestler over the ropes, first carry him by pressing
R,R,BLK (while he is stunned) and your wrestler will carry him up, then
press Punch near the ropes to toss him out. You can also carry him by
pressing R,R,BLK (in tie-up position behind opponent) then press Punch
when walking towards the rope. If you can't perform any of these moves,
you can also do the Back Body Drop when near the ropes, if you don't
know how to do the Back Body Drop, first perform an irish whip then when
your opponent is coming back to you, press Punch.

  -To tag your partner, first press L1 until your wrestlers faces your
tag team partner, then go near him and press Tie-Up (circle).

  -To call your partner, hold Block (X) then press R1. Your wrestler
will then call your partner without having to go near him and tag. This
is the only way a computer tag team partner can stop your opponent from
counting you out when pinned.

  -When you are standing over the weapon you want to pick up and it is
flashing white, tap L1. This is also the button which lets you pick
which opponent you want to beat up in matches where you fight more than
one opponent, so when fighting in Tag Team Hardcore matches, you have
to hold L1 while standing over a weapon to pick it up.

 -To call in your run in partner, when your health is in the red and opponents
 is green hold L1,L2,R1,R2 and press select.

@NODE "create2" "Create a Wrestler info"

This section is information about the options in create a
wrestler mode.

Text:

CHEST:       The text can be written vertically    (5 lines 10/3 lines 5)
             instead of horizontally by changing   (5 columns 8/3 col. 5)
             the orientation.  Sizes of space for
             letters in each font size are listed to the right.

BACK:       (same as chest)

BUTTOCKS:    Unfortunately, there's not enough     (5/3)
             room to write "Kiss It!" but you
             *can* sneak something small on the
             butt of whatever outfit your wrestler is wearing.

ARM SLEEVES: You have the option of left           (10/5)
             sleeve or right - you could
             put the same thing on either side, or have your wrestler's
             first name on one, and the last name on the other!

LEGS:       (same as Arm Sleeves)

Attributes
Here, you can determine your wrestler's raw ability.  Whether he's powerful, 
tough, fast, technically sound, popular, or all of the above, placing the points 
where they fit your wrestler is how to establish that.

You have 36 points regularly, but if you've unlocked the Extra Attributes cheat, 
your number will be raised to 39.  WWF WarZone players will recognize this same 
system from the old wrestler creation option, but a new ability, Mat Skills has 
been added.  As before, the skills range from 0-10.

STRENGTH:   Raw power.  This determines how damaging each move is.
     0 is X-Pac hitting The Big Show.  10 is Big Show hitting back.
TOUGHNESS:  How much can you take before you're stunned?
     0 makes you a pansy.  10 makes you very hard to put down!
SPEED:      This one's obvious, but it affects climbing speed and such.
     At 0, it'll take forever to climb turnbuckles and cages.
     At 10, you'll be up in plenty of time for a big move off the top.
RECOVERY:   Want to get up soon after being stunned?  Here you go.
     With a 0 setting, you'll be down for a while.  With 10, you'll
     shake it right off and be back on the job.
CHARISMA:   Don't underestimate this one.  The crowd chanting gives an
     automatic x2 to all your moves.  At 0, your wrestler will put the
     fans to sleep.  At 10, they'll go nuts at just about every he does!
MAT SKILLS: New to CAW, Mat Skills defines how well you can counter moves. 
Can you turn your opponent's DDT into a Northern Lights suplex?
     With a 0, no chance.  With a 10, almost every time!

As you go down the list, you'll notice there are slots for each move.  You have 
the following slots available:

Finisher:    "Final" move only executable in the Red.
Trademark:   "Big" move, secondary finisher, or just a really good move!
Damage 9:    One of these.
Damage 8:    Two slots here.
Damage 7:    Three possible moves.
Damage 6:    Four medium-damage slots.
Damage 5:    Five of these available.
Damage 4:    Four low-damage, warm-up moves.
Dizzy Punch:   (These two moves are covered in their own sections
Dizzy Kick:      later - mostly used for wrestler's personality/style)
Pose:          (Used for taunting and style - read the section)


Moves:
Ready position  (Unfinished list- for now)

future versions of this FAQ.  For example, Too Sexy's music has him remarking 
that he is 'not Jerry's Kid!'  And of course, the former members of the New Age 
Outlaws have their own DX spiels.

Personality:
Entrance
Remember, wrestlers such as Road Dog, HHH, and Billy Gunn only give their full 
speeches with their own music playing, and when "Talk" is switched to "Teen" in 
the Options menu.  So if you use, say, Road Dog's entrance but Stone Cold's 
music, don't be disappointed because he doesn't say, "Oh, You Didn't Know?"

Also, any dialogue inside [brackets] does *not* happen in House Show entrances.


* Stone Cold (Steve Austin):
["AUSTIN 3:16" is in white letters on black glass.  The glass shatters and] 
Austin steps out.  He walks to the ring, and I swear it looks like he's got a 
bit of a limp!  Up the stairs, through the ropes, and he goes to all four 
corner, standing on the second rope and raising both fists in the air.  [During 
his celebration, there is a spinning WWF logo displayed in the ring.]

* S(teve) Blackman:
The Lethal Weapon walks out [to the top of the stage and performs a right-leg-
forward low block before] heading down the aisle toward the ring.  He pauses 
after climbing the steps, then walks to the middle of one side and steps through 
the ropes.  He turns around, performs the low block once again, then performs a 
back spinning hook kick with his right leg- impressive!

* Bossman:
The Bossman takes a moment to come out, but strolls out casually at first, 
looking around the crowd with his arms folded.  Then he runs to the ring, slides 
under the bottom rope, and comes to his feet.  With his arms folded, he surveys 
the crowd looking quite the tough guy.

* Bradshaw:
[The lights flicker twice every half second while] a few shots of the entrance 
are shown, and Bradshaw walks down the aisle with authority.  He slides under 
the bottom rope, slaps his pecs a couple times, and ends by falling back against 
the ropes and bouncing off.

* Too Sexy (Brian Christopher):
[Purple lights strobe at the entrance, where] Brian struts out.  He alternates 
between prancing to the ring and waving his arms like he's clearing the air of 
smoke.  At the end of the aisle, he shies away from a fan, shaking his hands no 
and vehemently denying "I'm not Jerry's kid!"  Continuing up the steps and 
between the ropes, he turns around with his arms up, stands on the middle of the 
second rope, and sniff his armpits.  He hops down and laughs maniacally.

* Christian:
[The lights fade and go out; four lit candleabras, two on either side, dimly 
light the stage; and red lights come up around the entrance.  Those lights start 
flashing as] Christian walks out from the back, [and he drops to one knee.  
Hopping over the steps,] he heads to the ring and up the steel steps to the 
ring.  Climbing the turnbuckles, he crouches on the top for a moment, then hops 
down to the canvas and gets on all fours, crawling over to the corner and 
standing back up.

* Chyna:
The Ninth Wonder of the World steps out and [stops at the top of the ramp to put 
her hands on her hips.  Down the steps, she] heads to the ring, stopping [again] 
at the end of the aisle to put her hands on her hips.  That must be important, 
because after she rolls into ring and stands up, she does it one last time.

* D(-)Lo Brown:
After a couple shots of the entrance, [purple lights flicker and pulse as] D-Lo 
swaggers out and poses with boths arms out.  Then he [creeps down the stairs 
and] heads down the aisle, telling a fan "You're the one who sucks, punk, not 
me!"  Up the stairs, through the ropes, he walks a circle on the canvas before 
he climbs to the middle of the second rope and again puts his arms out to either 
side, saying "You better reco'nize!"  Finally, he hops off the ropes.

* Road Dog (Jesse James):  (rather long)
"Oh, you didn't know?  Your ass better caaaall somebodyyyy!"  Road Dog, [with 
the accompanying pointing,] delivers his tag line before heading down the aisle.  
He gestures toward himself and says, "It's me, it's me, it's that D-O-Double G."  
Up the steps and into the ring, then up onto the second turnbuckle for an 
overhead arm-crossing (in an X), then three DX crotch chops.  Finally he hops 
down, and in a very animated fashion delivers his trademark lines:  "LADIES and 
gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages:  Degeneration X proudly brings 
to you, one half of the TAG team CHAMPIONS of the WORRRRLD!  The Road Dog Jesse 
James!"

* Dr. Death (Steve Williams):
Williams strolls out from the entrance, and at the top of the ramp, he drops 
down to a three-point stance for a few seconds.  He stands back up and sprints 
to the ring, sliding in under the bottom rope.  Taking a moment to do his 
running-in-place charge, the camera shows him from different angles.  Dr. Death 
takes another moment to stretch out his shoulders and arms, then he's ready.

* (Darren) Droz(dov):
Droz strolls out, trying to get the kink out of his right shoulder, occasionally 
patting his other shoulder.  A good look of him standing still for a moment 
precedes him sliding in under the bottom rope.  After he stands up, he pats each 
shoulder with the opposite hand, then bounces back off the ring ropes.

* Edge:
My choice for the coolest entrance.  Say, where *IS* that sneaky little Edge 
anyway?  A couple shots of the crowd looking for him, then you see Edge walking 
through the crowd from the other side of the ring.  He hops the barricade, 
climbs up the turnbuckles and croutches on the top like a superhero, say Spider-
Man or Spawn.  Finally he hops down into the ring, throwing out his arms and 
giving a hearty yell.

* Farooq:
The lights flicker (see Bradshaw) during a few shots of the entrance, and Farooq 
walks to the ring with authority.  He slides under the bottom rope, and stands 
in the middle of the ring cracking his knuckles.

* Gangrel:  (rather long)
[The lights fade and go out; four lit candleabras, two on either side, dimly 
light the stage; and red lights flood the ring.  Those lights fade out but are 
replaced by red lights on stage.  They start flashing as an area of the stage 
bursts into flames!  Rising up from the burnin' ring of f'ar,] Gangrel emerges 
with a chalice in hand.  Taking a sip, he casually walks to the ring and up the 
steps, once more stopping for a drink after wiping the edge of the cup, then 
raising his head (presumably to spit his drink back out?)  Finally the Gothic 
wrestler steps through the ropes and into the ring, where he raises his hands 
[and the lights return to normal.]
  (Note: The ring of fire only happens on RAW entrances, otherwise Gangrel just 
walks out from the entrance.)

* Godfather:
Strutting out of the entrance, the Godfather heads down [the stairs sideways] 
and continues to high-step to the ring.  After going up the stairs, he wipes his 
feet on the apron, then steps into the ring, turning around and slapping his 
pecs before rebouding himself off the ropes.  Finally he stops and tells the 
crowd:  "A'ight, once again, it's time for everybody to come aboard the Hoooo 
train!"

* Goldust:  (long)
[The house lights fade out and the arena goes black, while the entrance lights 
slowly come back up in a golden hue.  After a lengthy moment, Goldust arrives 
blowing kisses to his adoring fans as golden sparklers on either side of the 
ramp (four) and the entrance (five each side) come to life for a few seconds 
before dying out.]  Goldust now heads down toward the ring, blowing kisses and 
gesturing grandly toward the stands, [while the sparklers flair up for another 
brief moment.]  Stopping at the ring to stretch out his leg, Goldie turns the 
corner to head up the stairs [as the sparklers can be seen coming to life one 
last time.]  'Dust brings both hands up the front of his jumpsuit, then drops to 
his knees and crawls to the nearest corner, where he stands back up and waits 
for his opponent.

* (Bad Ass) Billy Gunn: (fairly long)
"Oh, you didn't know?  Your ass better caaaall somebodyyyy!"  Mr. Ass strolls 
out [onto the stage, looking around, and stops to make a double-point to the 
right.]  He turns himself around and backs up a few paces to show off his.. 
moneymaker.  Turning forward, he strolls down the walkway.  At the end of the 
aisle, he gestures toward his crotch, then turns again, walking backward to the 
steps.  Up the stairs, a quick wipe of his feet on the apron, between the ropes, 
and into the ring.  "Now!  If you're not down with the New Age Outlaws and the 
Bad Ass Billy Gunn, I GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA!"  He performs the double-point to 
the right, raises both hands up for a long moment, then brings them down into a 
crotch chop as the crowd yells, "SUCK IT!"

* Head:
Head takes a moment to come out, but strolls out casually at first, looking 
around the crowd with its... arms? folded.  Then it runs to the ring, slides 
under the bottom rope, and comes to its feet.  With its... arms? folded, it 
surveys the crowd by turning its... neck? from side to side.
(Note:  This is basically the Bossman entrance.)

* (Sexual Chocolate) Mark Henry:
[Red Strobe lights flood the entrance area, and] Mark walks out into the arena     
casually strolls down the aisle, [drawing his arm aside for a smackdown swing.]  
pausing for a moment [where the lights return to normal] before turning the 
corner.  He heads up the stairs and into the ring, where he makes a backhanding 
gesture.

* HHH:  (really long)
[For the first few seconds, all you see is the entrance is neon green strobe 
lights.  Finally HHH walks to the top of the entrance, puts his arms out, and 
makes the "suck it" crotch chop.]  With microphone in hand, he strolls to the 
ring and up the stairs.  Once he's in the ring,  [the "X" neon green pyro goes 
off behind him] as the DX crotch chop is done four times.  Helmsley stands on a 
turnbuckle and crosses his arms over his head, then makes one more crotch chop 
for good measure before settling down and giving this speech:  "Are you Ready?  
I said - Are you Ready?  Then... for the thousands in attendance, and the 
millions watching at home... and for the one fat-ass guy sittin' on the couch 
playing this video game - let's get ready to SUCK IT!"

* Jacqueline:
[While purple lights flash and strobe,] Jacky struts her stuff down the aisle, 
pausing at the end for a moment, then up the stairs, and into the ring.  She 
slowly circles the ring waving to the crowd, then stands on the second 
turnbuckle and raises both arms before returning her feet to the canvas.

*J(eff) Jarrett:
Double J arrives with his guitar in hand, holding it high overhead for the crowd 
to see.  He walks down the aisle, stopping to point to himself and say "Don't 
Piss Me Off!"  He approaches the ring as if he's going to roll in, but changes 
his mind and goes to the stairs instead.  Jarrett and his gee-tar slip through 
the ropes and into the ring, where he wiggles his butt, does the Fargo strut, 
and raises both hands (and a guitar!) triumphantly.  As he swings the guitar, he 
spits out on last insult, "All you lowlifes can go to hell!"

* Kane:
[The lights go out, and two spots of tiny flame on either side are seen in the 
aisleway.  Two more join them, then two behind those, and a fourth set appears.  
But they all flare brightly in small columns of fire, as do four more on either 
side of the entrance.]  Kane walks out, stands still for a moment, then slowly 
starts heading toward the ring with a menacing walk.  [Behind him, the fire 
rises again at regular intervals as he continues.]  He slowly walks to the ring, 
climbs up onto the apron, steps over the top rope, and moves to the center of 
the ring.  Raising both arms slowly, he suddenly drops them down, [and the 
cornerposts all burst out with flame.]

* J(erry) Lawler:
Lawler swaggers out holding a kingly scepter, proudly strutting out with a slow 
walk.  He starts to evaluate the crowd in the stands, with big waving gestures.  
"Look at that!  She's so ugly...  but she's smart than he is!  Hahahaha!  His 
brain's on vacation!  And look - he's a moron!  The lights are on, but no one's 
home!"  A close up of Jerry shows him still waving.  "Ugh!  Her kid may be an 
honor student, but she's still an idiot!"  The King turns the corner to check 
out another fan.  "Maybe they're all just stupid!"  He heads up the steps and 
into the ring, still turning and giving his proud wave.  "Listen to these idiots 
- they're lovin' it!  They'll let anyone in here!  Hahahaha!"

* Kurrgan:
[The lights around the entrance flash in all different colors, and as the 
overhead lights go out,] Kurrgan strolls out, alternating between waving his 
hands in the air like he just doesn't care, and doing his little side stepping 
dance.  Up the steps and through the ropes, Kurrgan continues to dance inside 
the ring, still switching back and forth between the arm-waving and the side-
stepping.

* Mankind:
Mick Foley walks out at an angle, proudly showing Mr. Socko to fans on one side 
of the aisle,then the other.  He rolls into the ring under the bottom rope into 
a sitting position, rocking back and forth.  Mankind stands up as the camera 
angle switches to show him walking into a corner.  Another angle displays him 
sitting down in the corner, again rocking back and forth, and perhaps having a 
private conversation with Mr. Socko!

* (Marvelous) Marc Mero:
Marc strolls out practicing his hand work by doing a little shadowboxing, 
[heading down the stairs] and shuffling a bit before continuing.  At the end of 
the aisle, he turns and does a few left jabs, a little footwork, straightens up, 
and continues on to the steps.  Up the stairs, walking along the apron, between 
the ropes, and into the ring;  where he turns around and throws up both hands in 
the air as though he's already won the match.  A little more handwork leads into 
one last hand-raising pre-match celebration.

* Mosh:
[The white lights pulse as] the Headbanger saunters out and down the aisle, 
following the tone of the music.  At the end of the ramp, he pauses for a moment 
before stepping up to the ring.  Then he hops up to the apron and steps between 
the ropes, turning around in a circle and dancing a bit before  breaking out in 
full-fledged headbanging.

* Owen Hart:
[The house lights go out while yellow lights flicker at the entrance, and] Owen 
strolls out onto the stage.  [He pauses for a moment at the top of the ramp with 
hands on hips, then he continues to the ring slowly, looking around at the 
crowd.  Eventually he makes it up the steps, slingshots himself over the top 
rope, and into the ring.  Going to the second turnbuckle nearest the camera, he 
puts both arms up and "Whoo!"s.  Then he proclaims, "I am not a nugget!" while 
pointing to himself and dismissing the crowd with a wave of his hand before 
hopping down and surveying the audience one last time.

* P(aul) Bearer:
[The lights go out, and the entrance is lit up by a blue light.]  Paul swaggers 
out as only a man that fat can do, holding the [brightly-glowing] urn as if he 
stole it.  He turns from one side to the other, trying to keep the urn safely 
under one arm.  Lumbering to the ring, protectively carrying the urn, Paul heads 
up the stairs and steps between the ropes.  Finally he drops to one knee in the 
ring, holding the urn aloft for a moment, [all in the darkness.]

* The Rock:
No smackdown gestures, no mike work, and only a few white strobe lights on 
stage.  Just the Rock swaggering down the People's Aisle, pausing at the top of 
the People's Ramp before continuing, turning the People's Corner, going up the 
steps into the People's ring, and stepping over the People's Second Rope.  He 
takes a moment to listen to the millions... ("AND MILLIONS!") of the Rock's 
fans, before he gets into the People's Squared Circle - if ya smellllllalalala!  
What the Rock... (wait for it!) ...is cookin'!
(For the record, this is humor - the short answer is Rock just walks out slowly, 
not really doing anything extrodinary.)

* Sable:
Ever watched a beauty pageant?  How the entrants just walk down the aisle and 
wave to no one in particular?  Add in a couple splashes of green and purple 
lights every now and then, and that's Sable in a nutshell.  You can almost here 
Officer Barbrady saying, "Nothing to see, people, keep moving..."

* (Sgt.) Slaughter:
The Sarge strolls out from the back, puts his hands on his hips [at the top of 
the entrance stairs], surveys the crowd, and continues down the aisle.  At the 
end, he again stands with his hands on his hips.  Over to the stairs, up the 
steps, and into the ring, Slaughter stands once more with his hands on his hips.

* ("Heartbreak Kid") S(hawn) Michaels:  (fairly long)
[The lights go out, and the strobe lights on stage pulse in red as Michaels 
strolls out onto the stage.  He turns around in circles, then drops down into 
the classic lowered double-bicep pose.]  Shawn heads to the ring with his arms 
high (slapping fans' hands?) and [the house lights return to normal as] he 
climbs the steps.  Once in the ring, he dances around in a circle [while a large 
wiggling red heart graphic appears in the ring].  Again HBK strikes his 
trademark pose, [as a row of five red-and-white pyro rockets, from right to 
left, shoot straight up.]

* Al Snow:
After a moment, Snow emerges with Head in his hand, [raising it high in the air 
for a moment.]  He walks (limping a bit?) to the end of the aisle, where he 
raises Head overhead and bounces in a circle.  Then its over to the stairs, 
pause to look up, step through the ropes, and spin around like an airplane with 
his arms out.  Finally he raises Head over his head, and they both do a bit of 
headbanging.

* (Ken) Shamrock:
[With blue strobe lights working,] Ken wastes no time and marches to the ring 
and over to the ring stairs.  He stops, throws out his arms, slaps himself on 
either side of his head, and yells.  Now he steps through the ropes and is ready 
to wrestle.

* Taka (Michinoku):
[While the lights pulse and throb in blue, Michinoku arrives, swaying as he 
walks to the top of the ramp, where he puts both arms out and spins around like 
he's showing off a new outfit he just bought.]  Now Taka trots down the stairs, 
high-fives fans on either side of the aisle, climbs the steps, steps between the 
ropes, kneels in the center of the ring, and waves his hands past either side of 
his head three times.

* Thrasher:
[The white house lights flicker and pulse while Thrasher sways out to the music.  
He hops down the stairs, bounces on his feet, then] Thrasher sways down to the 
ring, where he pauses a moment to look at it.  Then Thrasher hops to the ring 
apron and steps between the ropes.  He dances (?) around the ring before 
headbanging himself around in a circle.

* Undertaker:  (rather long)
[The house lights go out, and a pair of candles light up.  The lights flicker 
once momentarily.  Another pair light behind them, and another, and a fourth, 
while blue light shines like pillars on either side.  Now on stage, a new pair 
comes to life, and three more pair in sequence follow, moving away from center 
while the whole entrance is now lit in a shade of blue.  With a stroke of 
lightning,] The Undertaker strides out from the back and [stands still, then] 
strolls down the walkway.  [As he passes each pair of candlesticks, their flame 
raises a little higher.]  The dead man continues his slow walk down to the ring.  
While standing on the ring steps, the Undertaker raises his arms slowly, [and 
the lights come back on.]  Stepping through the ropes, he stands tall and looks 
around the arena for a few moments.

* Val Venis:
[Purple house lights flicker while Venis swaggers out onto the stage, stopping 
to put his hands behind his head and swivel his hips.  Sidestepping down the 
stairs,] Val shakes the water off his hands, and continues while he walks 
normally down the aisle.  As its end, [the lights return to normal as] Val makes 
his way up the steps.  The Big Valbowski dusts his feet on the apron, then steps 
into the ring, bouncing backward off the ropes and saying "Hello, Ladies!"

* X-Pac:
[While his music starts, the entrance flickers in green strobe lights. Finally, 
X-Pac arrives and riles the crowd by leaning back with his arms at his side.  
While] X-Pac heads to the ring, [as he gets halfway down the aisle, the lights 
fade.]  After climbing up the stairs, X-Pac hops over the top rope into the 
ring, and takes center stage.  After throwing his arms out to the side, he 
performs the DX chop [as the green "X" pyro goes off behind him,] then again, 
and a third time while jumping up in the air.


The Trainer's entrance is not available for use, but for the sake of 
completeness, here it is:
[While viewing the entrance, a set of grey sparklers (?) lights up.  Behind 
those, a green set comes to life, followed by a blue set, and lastly a set in 
red.  Now they start across the stage from the outside edges, working toward the 
middle - first green, then purple, blue, red, and green again.  As the last one 
fades down,] the Trainer saunters out from the back, [pausing with hands on hips 
to look around.]  He slows lumbers to the ring, stopping with his hands on his 
hips to assess the crowd.  Up the stairs and between the ropes, he again puts 
his hands on his hips and surveys the crowd.  Basically, it's Slaughter with 
pyro.



Run-In Partner:
While you can't pick another created wrestler, you can choose a WWF superstar 
who will [theoretically, anyway] come down and assist you when you're getting 
double-teamed and brutally beaten.  I've read that you can call them down by 
pressing R1+O when you're in the Red, but I've never seen it happen.

But anyway, go ahead and pick whoever you'd like to have watching your back, 
just in case it works. Here's the list, for reference:

Stone Cold
S Blackman
Bossman
Bradshaw
Too Sexy
Christian
Chyna
D Lo Brown
Road Dogg
Dr. Death
Droz
Edge
Faarooq
Gangrel
Goldust
Godfather

Head
Mark Henry
HHH
Jacqueline
J Jarrett
Kane
J Lawler
Kurrgan
Mankind
