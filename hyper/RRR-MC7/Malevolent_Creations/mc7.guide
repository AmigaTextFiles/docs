    We take absolutely no responsibility whatever the buttons below may
 cause to your health, sanity, grandma or something else, if you press 'em.
    If you are not interested in your life as it is now, just go ahead.
                    You will never be the same. Never.

                           YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Avaruussinfonia " system "data/0a.dat data/71.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Ethereal spirits and sentient life forms rule the Void, while pathetic
 humans float helplessly around - soon to be devoured by the radiating
 comet-creature. Take care while watching this blasphemous Space Symphony.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Crazy RGB's " system "data/0a.dat data/72.dat blank reltime 5"}

 This is how the multi-eyed Ancient Ones see their beloved Egypt,
 their kingdom which once was, and which once shall be. After day
 cometh night; man's day shall pass, and They shall rule where
 They once ruled.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Don't watch this, watch that " system "data/0a.dat data/73.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Insecticide is of no use when these creatures infest your home with
 their foulness. Those little demons will twist your dreams in your
 sleep, making you do horrible things in the morning. Nlogghtua's spawn
 will make its lair inside your bed, nursing itself with your psychic
 energy. This is the Breeding. Just wait to see the whole Cycle of Life.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Hiphop Harmonies " system "data/0a.dat data/74.dat blank reltime 3"}

 Peace is only an illusion in this vision. Further study reveals the
 reckoning occult symbols flashing every now and then in the sinister
 dreams of those hiphop persons. Those black dudes actually appear to
 be no humans at all - take a note of those transformation abilities...
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Noitametsä " system "data/0a.dat data/75.dat blank reltime 6"}

 Humans try to reach the HattiVatti-island, but those cunning little
 creatures just sail away with their living boat. Even lightning from
 the heavens doesn't affect them. When reaching the shore, humans are
 digested by earth itself, eaten deep down there... and you can see their
 lost souls ascending as an unending stream.... Only to come back for
 more pain. As you can see, there is no escape from the Witch Forest.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sorry, no bonus.
