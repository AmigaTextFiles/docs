 @{b}I Worship His Shadow [#1]@{ub} (1995)

 Kai and the Brunnen-G make a final attempt to stop His Shadow from destroying
 their planet, but fail, and Kai, the last of the Brunnen-G, is turned into an
 assassin. 2000 years later, Stanley (working as a courier) is left stranded in
 space after a space station is destroyed and is then captured by mercenaries.
 Zev of B3K is to be transformed into a love slave (for not performing her
 wifely duties), but before the process is completed, a cluster lizard is
 caught in the machine with Zev, merging them together. Zev gets the love slave
 body, but 790, a robot, receives the mind altering program.

 Stanley (after escaping from the mercenaries and becoming a security guard,
 class 4) and Zev, now on the run from His Divine Shadow for various offences,
 join forces with Thodin and set out to steal the Lexx, an organic spaceship,
 and end the rein of His Divine Shadow.

 Stanley and Zev begin a search for Kai's home planet, to discover if there is
 a way for Kai to live without protoblood. When they find it, they discover the
 Poet Man, an image of a long dead man with a hidden agenda. Giggerota, working

 ending the prophecy that states that the last of the Brunnen-G, Kai, will
 destroy His Divine Shadow.
