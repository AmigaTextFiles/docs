<P>

Something has to change.<BR>
Un-deniable dilemma.<BR>
Boredom's not a burden<BR>
Anyone should bear.<BR>
<P>
Constant over stimu-lation numbs me<BR>
and I wouldn't have<BR>
It any other way.<BR>
<P>
It's not enough.<BR>
I need more.<BR>
Nothing seems to satisfy.<BR>
I don't want it.<BR>
I just need it.<BR>
To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive.<BR>
<P>
Finger deep within the borderline.<BR>
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.<BR>
Relax, turn around and take my hand.<BR>
<P>
I can help you change<BR>
Tired moments into pleasure.<BR>
Say the word and we'll be<BR>
Well upon our way.<BR>
<P>
Blend and balance<BR>
Pain and comfort<BR>
Deep within you<BR>
Till you will not have me any other way.<BR>
<P>
It's not enough.<BR>
I need more.<BR>
Nothing seems to satisfy.<BR>
I don't want it.<BR>
I just need it.<BR>
To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive.<BR>
<P>
Knuckle deep inside the borderline.<BR>
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.<BR>
Relax. Slip away.<BR>
<P>
Something kinda sad about<BR>
the way that things have come to be.<BR>
Desensitized to everything.<BR>
What became of subtlety?<BR>
<P>
How can it mean anything to me<BR>
If I really don't feel anything at all ?<BR>
<P>
I'll keep digging till<BR>
I feel something.<BR>
<P>
Elbow deep inside the borderline.<BR>
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.<BR>
Shoulder deep within the borderline.<BR>
Relax. Turn around and take my hand.<BR>

<P>

He had alot to say.<BR>
He had alot of nothing to say.<BR>
We'll miss him.<BR>
<P>
So long.<BR>
We wish you well.<BR>
You told us how you weren't afraid to die.<BR>
Well then, so long.<BR>
Don't cry.<BR>
Or feel too down.<BR>
Not all martyrs see divinity.<BR>
But at least you tried.<BR>
<P>
Standing above the crowd,<BR>
He had a voice that was strong and loud.<BR>
We'll miss him.<BR>
Ranting and pointing his finger<BR>
At everything but his heart.<BR>
We'll miss him.<BR>
<P>
No way to recall<BR>
What it was that you had said to me,<BR>
Like I care at all.<BR>
<P>
So loud.<BR>
You sure could yell.<BR>
You took a stand on every little thing<BR>
And so loud.<BR>
<P>
Standing above the crowd,<BR>
He had a voice so strong and loud and I<BR>
Swallowed his facade cuz I'm so<BR>
Eager to identify with<BR>
Someone above the ground,<BR>
Someone who seemed to feel the same,<BR>
Someone prepared to lead the way, with<BR>
Someone who would die for me.<BR>
<P>
Will you? Will you now?<BR>
Would you die for me?<BR>
Don't you fuckin lie.<BR>
<P>
Don't you step out of line.<BR>
Don't you fuckin lie.<BR>
<P>
You've claimed all this time that you would die for me.<BR>
Why then are you so surprised to hear your own eulogy?<BR>
<P>
You had alot to say.<BR>
You had alot of nothing to say.<BR>
<P>
Come down.<BR>
Get off your fuckin cross.<BR>
We need the fuckin space to nail the next fool martyr.<BR>
<P>
To ascend you must die.<BR>
You must be crucified<BR>
For your sins and your lies. [sic]<BR>
Goodbye...<BR>

<P>

What's coming through is alive.<BR>
What's holding up is a mirror.<BR>
But what's singing songs is a snake<BR>
Looking to turn this piss to wine.<BR>
<P>
They're both totally void of hate,<BR>
But killing me just the same.<BR>
<P>
The snake behind me hisses<BR>
What my damage could have been.<BR>
My blood before me begs me<BR>
Open up my heart again.<BR>
<P>
And I feel this coming over like a storm again.<BR>
Considerately.<BR>
<P>
Venomous voice, tempts me,<BR>
Drains me, bleeds me,<BR>
Leaves me cracked and empty.<BR>
Drags me down like some sweet gravity.<BR>
<P>
The snake behind me hisses<BR>
What my damage could have been.<BR>
My blood before me begs me<BR>
Open up my heart again.<BR>
<P>
And I feel this coming over like a storm again.<BR>
<P>
I am too connected to you to<BR>
Slip away, to fade away.<BR>
Days away I still feel you<BR>
Touching me, changing me,<BR>
And considerately killing me.<BR>
<P>
Without the skin,<BR>
Beneath the storm,<BR>
Under these tears<BR>
The walls came down.<BR>
<P>
And the snake is drowned and<BR>
As I look in his eyes,<BR>
My fear begins to fade<BR>
Recalling all of those times.<BR>
<P>
I could have cried then.<BR>
I should have cried then.<BR>
<P>
And as the walls come down and<BR>
As I look in your eyes<BR>
My fear begins to fade<BR>
Recalling all of the times<BR>
I have died<BR>
and will die.<BR>
It's all right.<BR>
I don't mind.<BR>
<P>
I am too connected to you to<BR>
Slip away, to fade away.<BR>
Days away I still feel you<BR>
Touching me, changing me,<BR>
<P>
And considerately killing me.<BR>

<A NAME="Forty"><H2>Forty-six & 2</H2></A>

<P>

My shadow's<BR>
<P>
Shedding skin and<BR>
I've been picking<BR>
Scabs again.<BR>
I'm down<BR>
Digging through<BR>
My old muscles<BR>
Looking for a clue.<BR>
<P>
I've been crawling on my belly<BR>
Clearing out what could've been.<BR>
I've been wallowing in my own confused<BR>
And insecure delusions<BR>
For a piece to cross me over<BR>
Or a word to guide me in.<BR>
I wanna feel the changes coming down.<BR>
I wanna know what I've been hiding in<BR>
<P>
My shadow.<BR>
Change is coming through my shadow.<BR>
My shadow's shedding skin<BR>
I've been picking<BR>
My scabs again.<BR>
<P>
I've been crawling on my belly<BR>
Clearing out what could've been.<BR>
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic<BR>
And insecure delusions.<BR>
<P>
I wanna feel the change consume me,<BR>
Feel the outside turning in.<BR>
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and<BR>
Cleansing I've endured within<BR>
<P>
My shadow<BR>
Change is coming.<BR>
Now is my time.<BR>
Listen to my muscle memory.<BR>
Contemplate what I've been clinging to.<BR>
Forty-six and two ahead of me.<BR>
<P>
I choose to live and to<BR>
Grow, take and give and to<BR>
Move, learn and love and to<BR>
Cry, kill and die and to<BR>
Be paranoid and to<BR>
Lie, hate and fear and to<BR>
Do what it takes to move through.<BR>
<P>
I choose to live and to<BR>
Lie, kill and give and to<BR>
Die, learn and love and to<BR>
Do what it takes to step through.<BR>
<P>
See my shadow changing,<BR>
Stretching up and over me.<BR>
Soften this old armor.<BR>
Hoping I can clear the way<BR>
By stepping through my shadow,<BR>
Coming out the other side.<BR>
Step into the shadow.<BR>
Forty six and two are just ahead of me.<BR>

<A NAME="Hooker"><H2>Hooker With A Penis</H2></A>

<P>

I met a boy wearing Vans, 501s, and a<BR>
Dope Beastie t, nipple rings, and<BR>
New tattoos that claimed that he<BR>
Was OGT,<BR>
From '92,<BR>
The first EP.<BR>
<P>
And in between<BR>
Sips of Coke<BR>
He told me that<BR>
He thought<BR>
We were sellin' out,<BR>
Layin' down,<BR>
Suckin' up<BR>
To the man.<BR>
<P>
Well now I've got some<BR>
A-dvice for you, little buddy.<BR>
Before you point the finger<BR>
You should know that<BR>
I'm the man,<BR>
<P>
And if I'm the man,<BR>
<P>
Then you're the man, and<BR>
He's the man as well so you can<BR>
Point that fuckin' finger up your ass.<BR>
<P>
All you know about me is what I've sold you,<BR>
Dumb fuck.<BR>
I sold out long before you ever heard my name.<BR>
<P>
I sold my soul to make a record,<BR>
Dip shit,<BR>
And you bought one.<BR>
<P>
So I've got some<BR>
Advice for you, little buddy.<BR>
Before you point your finger<BR>
You should know that<BR>
I'm the man,<BR>
<P>
If I'm the fuckin' man<BR>
Then you're the fuckin' man as well<BR>
So you can<BR>
Point that fuckin' finger up your ass.<BR>
<P>
All you know about me is what I've sold you,<BR>
Dumb fuck.<BR>
I sold out long before you ever heard my name.<BR>
<P>
I sold my soul to make a record,<BR>
Dip shit,<BR>
And you bought one.<BR>
<P>
All you read and<BR>
Wear or see and<BR>
Hear on TV<BR>
Is a product<BR>
Begging for your<BR>
Fatass dirty<BR>
Dollar<BR>
<P>
So...Shut up and<BR>

Buy  my new record<BR>
Send more money<BR>
Fuck you, buddy.<BR>

<P>

What was it like to see<BR>
The face of your own stability<BR>
Suddenly look away<BR>
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?<BR>
<P>
Eleven and she was gone.<BR>
Eleven is when we waved good-bye.<BR>
Eleven is standing still,<BR>
Waiting for me to free him<BR>
By coming home.<BR>
<P>
Moving me with a sound.<BR>
Opening me within a gesture.<BR>
Drawing me down and in,<BR>
Showing me where it all began,<BR>
Eleven.<BR>
<P>
It took so long to realize that<BR>
You hold the light that's been leading me back home.<BR>
<P>
Under a dead ohio sky,<BR>
Eleven has been and will be waiting,<BR>
Defending his light,<BR>
And wondering...<BR>
Where the hell have I been?<BR>
Sleeping, lost, and numb.<BR>
So glad that I have found you.<BR>
I am wide awake and heading home.<BR>
<P>
Hold your light,<BR>
Eleven.<BR>
Lead me through each gentle step by step<BR>
by inch by loaded memory.<BR>
<P>
I'll move to heal<BR>
As soon as pain allows so we can<BR>
Reunite and both move on together.<BR>
<P>
Hold your light,<BR>
Eleven. Lead me through each gentle step by step<BR>
By inch by loaded memory<BR>
'till one and one are one, eleven,<BR>
So glow, child, glow.<BR>
<P>
I'm heading back home.<BR>

<A NAME="Pushit"><H2>Pushit</H2></A>

<P>

I will choke until I swallow...<BR>
Choke this infant here before me.<BR>
What is this but my reflection?<BR>
Who am I to judge and strike you down?<BR>
<P>
But you're<BR>
Pushing and shoving me.<BR>
You still love me and you pushit on me.<BR>
<P>
Rest your trigger on my finger,<BR>
bang my head upon the fault line.<BR>
Take care not to make me enter.<BR>
'cause if I do we both may disappear.<BR>
<P>
But you're pushing me,<BR>
Shoving me. Pushit on me.<BR>
<P>
Slipping back into the gap again.<BR>
I'm alive when you're touching me,<BR>
Alive when you're shoving me down.<BR>
<P>
But i'd trade it all<BR>
For just a little bit of<BR>
Peace of mind.<BR>
<P>
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be.<BR>
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see.<BR>
Never wanna see that place again.<BR>
<P>
Saw that gap again today<BR>
As you were begging me to stay.<BR>
Managed to push myself away,<BR>
And you, as well.<BR>
<P>
If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,<BR>
You minimize my movement anyway,<BR>
I must persuade you another way.<BR>
<P>
There's no love in fear.<BR>
<P>
Staring down the hole again.<BR>
Hands upon my back again.<BR>
Survival is my only friend.<BR>
Terrified of what may come.<BR>
<P>
Just remember I will always love you,<BR>
Even as I tear your fucking throat away.<BR>
But it will end no other way.<BR>

Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of<BR>
Freaks<BR>

Fret for your figure and<BR>

Followed by faultlines that cannot sit still.<BR>
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits.<BR>

Some say the end is near.<BR>
Some say we'll see armageddon soon.<BR>
I certainly hope we will cuz<BR>
I sure could use a vacation from this<BR>

I wanna watch it all go down.<BR>
Mom please flush it all away.<BR>
I wanna watch it go right in and down.<BR>
I wanna watch it go right in.<BR>
Watch you flush it all away.<BR>
<P>
Time to bring it down again.<BR>
Don't just call me pessimist.<BR>
Try and read between the lines.<BR>

Welcome any change, my friend.<BR>

Suck it down.<BR>
Flush it down.<BR>

<A NAME="Eye"><H2>Third Eye</H2></A>

<P>

Dreaming of that face again.<BR>
It's bright and blue and shimmering.<BR>
Grinning wide<BR>
And comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes.<BR>
<P>
On my back and tumbling<BR>
Down that hole and back again<BR>
Rising up<BR>
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye.<BR>
<P>
In... Out... In... Out... In... Out...<BR>
<P>
A child's rhyme stuck in my head.<BR>
It said that life is but a dream.<BR>
I've spent so many years in question<BR>
to find I've known this all along.<BR>
<P>
"So good to see you.<BR>
I've missed you so much.<BR>
So glad it's over.<BR>
I've missed you so much<BR>
Came out to watch you play.<BR>
Why are you running?"<BR>
<P>
Shroud-ing all the ground around me<BR>
Is this holy crow above me.<BR>
Black as holes within a memory<BR>
And blue as our new second sun.<BR>
I stick my hand into his shadow<BR>
To pull the pieces from the sand.<BR>
Which I attempt to reassemble<BR>
To see just who I might have been.<BR>
I do not recognize the vessel,<BR>
But the eyes seem so familiar.<BR>
Like phosphorescent desert buttons<BR>
Singing one familiar song...<BR>
<P>
"So good to see you.<BR>
I've missed you so much.<BR>
So glad it's over.<BR>
I've missed you so much.<BR>
Came out to watch you play.<BR>
Why are you running away?"<BR>
<P>
Prying open my third eye.<BR>
So good to see you once again.<BR>
I thought that you were hiding.<BR>
And you thought that I had run away.<BR>
Chasing the tail of dogma.<BR>
I opened my eye and there we were.<BR>
<P>
So good to see you once again<BR>
I thought that you were hiding from me.<BR>
And you thought that I had run away.<BR>
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason.<BR>
<P>
Prying open my third eye.<BR>
