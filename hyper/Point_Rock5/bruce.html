The Iron Maiden's ex-singer Bruce Dickinson is back with a new album called "Accident of Birth".
This new CD, which is out since May 1997, has been recorded with an old friend of Bruce :
Adrian Smith <BR>( hey, it's the ex-guitarist of Iron Maiden... ?! ).

<P>

Remember 1992 : Bruce told to the world that he wanted to leave Iron Maiden because he was tired of
the same old routine. He wanted to make a music quite different of Maiden's one. Then he made
"Balls to Picasso", after it, he came with a brand new band the time of a single album
"Skunkworks" ( exception of "Alive in Studio A" ).

<P>

Now, he seems to change his mind and come back to the roots with this new record. This one is
very heavy, and some songs could easily be on the Iron Maiden track list : listen to "Dark Side
of Aquarius", "Road To Hell" to hear it....
Adrian Smith does a good job on this record. It's near a dream to hear the two guys together since
1990 ( when Ade left the Maiden ).<BR><BR>

The other songs are very good, it's a real pleasure to hear again the "Air Raid Siren", singing
his songs with this marvelous voice.
There are some nice slower pieces like "Taking the Queen", "Man of Sorrows", "Ace of Space".

<P>

The album is not bad at all, I just wonder why Bruce left Iron Maiden 5 years ago. With such an
album, Maiden could get new horizons because "Accident of Birth" is a good piece of work.
Oh, by the way.... Guess who drew the cover sleeve of the CD ? It's.... yes, you know it.... Derek
Riggs ( the father of <BR>Eddie ) !!! And guess how the new mascot of Bruce is called ??? Edison !!!
I don't believe this ! How could he dare to do it ? Eddie's son... No !!!

<P>

My quote for this album is 8/10
