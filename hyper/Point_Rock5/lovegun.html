<H1>Love Gun - Tribute to KISS ( Spirit of 66 : 28/03 )</H1>

<P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>

This  wednesday evening, Love  Gun  explosed Verviers. In fact, it was The Spirit of 66, THE
specialised  club  in  Verviers ( or  for other, a good place to get completely drunk ) ---
NdR : Ace makes here  a clear allusion to me : the first time I went in that bar, I went
drunk !!! Burps ---

<P>

Let's say that the place was fairly full, but it's the quality and not the quantity !!! A lot of
people  there  were real Kiss-freaks. Shame on  all who were not  converted  because they  didn't
understood the conversations between specialists, for example : which  costume  has been weared
on that tour by this musician, or who was the co-author of this B-side  title only available in
Portugal...

<P>

We  expect  thus  to  live  again a unique experience, such kind of a Time Machine, as the actual
tour of the original band : "BACK TO THE FUTURE" !!

<P>

Suddenly, the lights are going down, people get nervous ( except people at the bar ). The intro
( a classical orchestral version of <I>BLACK DIAMOND</I> ) makes the adrenalin pump. And then,
it's the explosion when the band from Hamburg comes on stage and plays <I>DETROIT ROCK CITY</I>
while flames are thrown to the roof ( it's at this moment that we fthought that Love Gun will
explode the Spirit of 66 ). The stage is too small and the roof too low to let those amateur
pyrotechnists try all their visual effects.

<P>

But the feeling is passing, connoisseurs are excited and sing word after word.

<P>

The visual aspect is very studied, it's a tribute to the great era : the years 75/76, the <I>ALIVE!</I>
years, maybe one of the best live albums ever recorded. The costumes seem to get out from the KISS
wardrobe. The singer moves like a gay, the drummer sings <I>BETH</I> but doesn't go in the air with
the drum-kit ( seen the height of the roof in the place, it would be difficult !!! ). The very good
guitarist ( nearly better than the original ) plays with a smoking guitar, and the bass player attacks
his bass ( in the form of an axe ), spits blood and fire more than one time.

<P>

All the classics are played, from <I>DEUCE</I> to <I>I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU</I> and passing by
<I>FIREHOUSE</I>,<I> COLD GIN</I>,<I> CALLIN' DR LOVE</I>,...<BR>
The guitarist  has sung <I>SHOCK ME</I>,<I> HARD TIMES</I>,<I> NEW YORK GROOVE</I>.<BR>
It's obvious why this band is considered as the best tribute band to KISS in Europe.

<P>

For the final ( a majestic <I>BLACK DIAMOND</I> ), all the crowd ( and me... ) was singing with the
band and I've astonised to see an old man aged about of 70 years dancing like a young teenager. There
is no age for KISS !!!

<P>

Here finishes a memorable evening...

<P>

<I>Let's see you on Tour next summer, maybe in Gent on the 10th of june '97 or somewhere else,
you know who you are : YOU WANT THE BEST, YOU GET THE BEST, THE HARDEST BAND IN THE WORLD :
