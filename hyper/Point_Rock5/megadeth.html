The previous album of Megadeth ( Youthanasia ) was in his time a good Heavy Metal album, quite
straight and powerful. But as time passed by, people found it a little too commercial.
It's quite the same thing here : I don't have so much fun to listen Youthanasia than when I bought
it.

<P>

But the new album of the band ( Cryptic Writings ) is more complex than you can think. It seems to
be "easy" the first time you put a ear on it, but this album needs more than 1 listening to reveal
all it contains. Songs like "Trust" or "Use The Man" are good examples.

<P>

I think that this new album is better than Youthanasia because there is a good balance between
slower songs and faster ones. "Cryptic Writings" ends with a so fast song ( FFF ) that you may
think it's coming from unused songs of Metallica when Dave Mustaine was playing guitar there !!!

<P>

The other members of the band have co-written some songs, and this adds something new to the
compositions which are very powerful. The bass is more present than before on some songs ( like
"I'll get even" ) and this adds a better groove... There is even a song that Steve Harris ( Iron
Maiden ) would not refuse !!! Listen the end part of "She-Wolf" to see....

<P>

At the end of this test, I must say that this album convinced me and I can easily quote it at 8/10.
