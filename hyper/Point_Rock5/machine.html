I have bought this album some months ago in the first days it was out. I know this test may be a
little outdated but this album needed to figure in Point & Rock. <BR>
To say it straight, "The More Things Change" is fit to be the successor of "Burn My Eyes".

<P>

This new CD begins in a fury with "Ten Ton Hammer", a very loud song. We feel in this song that
Rob Flynn is upset !!! But it's good for the music...<BR>
The general atmosphere of this album is very Heavy : you won't charm your girlfriend with this kind
of music ( especially if she likes the Boys Bands style... ). Everything smells sweat and hard work.
Maybe you can find some darker songs like "Down To None" with a very slow and anxious intro but it
soon finishes in an aggressive way.

<P>

If you have the chance to find again the digipack version of the album, you will be gratified with
3 bonus tracks with a reprise from Ice-T "Colors" and a reprise of Discharge "The Possibility Of Life
Destruction". This one is quite chaotic and ultra speed but it's not to disappoint me. Colors is a
rap song, quite good but it has not impressed me.

<P>

Visually, the digipack is really aggressive with dirty pics of war horrors. It's very dark and
impressive...

<P>

My quote for this album is 8/10.
