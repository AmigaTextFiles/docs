<P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>

So, you have reached the end of Point and Rock 5. I would like to apologize to my previous readers :
this edition has been <U><B>HEAVILY</B></U> delayed. It's part because of lazziness, but also my
studies : I had to finish my rapport and the mag has been temporarly shut down.

<P>

I would like to thank everybody who supported me these months during P&R 4 and 5, asking me when the
next issue would finaly be out ! I dedicate this issue to them : Yohu, Afreak, Lestat, Ferris... and
the rest I forgot.

<P>

Thanx also to everyone who sent me some articles or ideas or images...

<P>

I hope that the new readers has been pleased by this mag. If you want to be added in my mailing list
to know when the new issue is out, please send an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:nr18@geocities.com">me</A>.

<P>

I REALLY REALLY hope that this new format is the good one, because I have put a lot of work, time
and hope in it. I think that the result is not soooo bad for a not-professional magazine.

<P>

To finish, I would like to say again that this mag is opend to <U><B>ALL</B></U> styles of Hard Rock.
So if you have any article you would like to be published, don't hesitate to send it to me. Articles
can be in ASCII ( send also pictures if any ), or already coded in HTML with images and backgrounds.

<P>

That's it, I have said all I wanted to say, I give you rendez-vous in Point & Rock 6 (66) !!!

<P>

666, the number of the beast<BR>
Hell and fire was spawned to be released<BR>
