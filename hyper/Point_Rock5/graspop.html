<H1>Graspop Metal Meeting 97 : 29 june</H1>

<P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>

This memorable sunday, we were travelling ( Ace and I ) to Dessel to assist this Metal festival.
There was some good bands playing there and we hoped to have a nice day.
The weather was not so bright but we have the habit here in Belgium ( even in summer vacation ! ).

<P>

When we arrived, the first thing was to find a place to park the car and we found it in a field
( which became later a horrible battle field ( see further ) ).

<P>

We came just in time to see <I>Uncle Meat</I>. In fact, we were on the festival ground during their
first song. It's the band of a friend and it was the second time I saw them.<BR> Despite some
technical problems ( this time it was not the drum kit ;-) ), they have received a better welcome
than the first time I saw them at the Kiss' show in Gent.

<P>

After their gig, we went to the "market tents" to see if something interesting was to sell. I found
there the tour book of Iron Maiden at the Monsters of Rock 92 in Castle Donington. <I>Entombed</I>
was playing on the main stage. Their show seemed not so bad but I have not seen them.
<B>And that's here that Mrs Rain came.</B>

<P>

Then it was the time of <I>Samael</I> to play but I have not seen a lot 'coz it was raining and we
went to the marquee stage ( under a giant tent ) to see the first band playing there : <I>Dimmu Borgir</I>.
One thing to say about those Black Metal bands is that I prefer to listen this kind of dark and
atmospheric music in my sleeping room than live ( but their shows are nice to see ).

<P>

At 12:30, it was time to meet Uncle Meat at their signature session ( and time for me to meet my
IRC contact Afreak, the drummer of the Uncle ( hi mate ! ) ). It has been the occasion to talk with
the band ( their bassist speaks well french !!! ) and to come back with their signed albums.

<P>

Moving to the main stage to see <I>Grip Inc</I>. Wow ! What a gig... This band is fantastic and Dave
Lombardo is really a great drummer !!! Also the singer who is a good frontman, always speaking to the
crowd to excite it.

<P>

Back to the Marquee ( we've walked a lot this day !! ) to see <I>The Gathering</I>. It was a pure
beauty. The singer ( a woman ) has a so wonderful voice, contrasting with the guitars in the back.
Their music is quite slow and depressive, but it's superb. The Gathering are one of the best bands
I've seen at this festival.

<P>

<I>Saxon</I> played on the main stage under a continuous rain. I liked their Heavy Metal ( back to
the good old days ). The funniest thing at their gig was the mud-battle between fans in the crowd.
The singer asked to stop to throw mud on stage or the band would not finish their show, but no one
listend to him, the battle was raging on !!!

<P>

Back to the... guess what ??? The Marquee !!! It was to see <I>Cradle of Filth</I>. It's just the
same note than for Dimmu Borgir, but the light show was impressive. The singer of this band is
astonishing. He can sing with a very deep voice and 2 seconds later, he's in the high notes !!! Great...

<P>

After it, we went away to visit the place. There was a third stage : the Skate stage. We just saw
<I>Deviate</I> there. Having seen them 3 weeks ago, we didn't stayed there a lot. We went to the
Metal Market. You can see the Skate Stage and the Metal Market on this picture ( respectively left
and right ).

<P>

As you can see on this photograph, the rain has already made a lot of damages to the ground. It was
a giant mud-bath...
<BR>Inside the Metal Market, water was everywhere and I wonder yet now how the merchandising has
not been damaged....

<P>

I have not found something to buy there but my friend bought the last album of The Gathering and a
bootleg of his favourite band : Kiss.

<P>

<IMG WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=235 SRC="graspop5.gif" ALT="Main Stage" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Here you have a view of the main stage with <I>Biohazard</I> playing ( you can see a part of their
last album logo at the extreme right of the picture ). I have not seen them because I was speaking
with Afreak ( I met him randomly as I was coming back from the Metal Market ). The keyboard player
of Uncle Meat was there also, so we've drank a beer while speaking about....computers ! Afreak and
I have an Amiga and the other has a Macintosh... Not really rock and roll, but it's another passion !

<P>

We took some pictures ( you can see a picture of Afreak and I in the "<A HREF="final.html">Last
Words</A>" section ) and waited the coming of <I>Moonspell</I> in the Marquee. This gig was good but I
don't remember a lot about this band... Sorry !

<P>

<IMG WIDTH=244 HEIGHT=352 SRC="graspop2.gif" ALT="Dave Mustaine" ALIGN=LEFT>
Time to see the <I>Megadeth</I> on the Main stage. I've took some good pictures there of the band.
You can see here Dave Mustaine who was in great form !!! The band gave us a very good gig with some
classics. The new compositions are well rendered live but we had to wait a long time to hear the
first extract from "<A HREF="megadeth.html">Cryptic Writings</A>". They've played "Trust",
"Almost Honest", "Use The Man" and maybe one or two others I don't remember. A great moment was
when they played "A tout le monde" : everybody was singing with Dave. Great !!!

<P>

Just one note ( but I don't have a scan to show it ), David Ellefson has cut his hair. It seems that
all Hard Rockers are bored with their long hairs....<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<P>

At the end of the show, I went to the food-stands to buy something to eat ( it was 9 pm ). I came
back to the Marquee with fried potatoes !!! <I>My Dying Bride</I> was canceled and we saw <I>Tiamat</I>
instead. I saw them last year at the same festival, but it was during the day with no light-show and
it was not so great. This year, it's radically different ! Their depressive and strange music was
supported with an impressive light-show and all was marvelous. It's another band that pleased me this
year. Unfortunately, I have not seen the entire show because we wanted to be near the main stage to
see the last band : <I>Alice Cooper</I>.

<P>

<IMG WIDTH=245 HEIGHT=352 SRC="graspop1.gif" ALT="Alice Cooper" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Alice was one of the "old artist" I wanted to see, it's done now !!! And I must say that even at
50+ years old, this guy is yet great !!! Damn, he has a great presence on stage ( but sometimes
he disappears during 5 minutes backstage to change his clothes while the musicians are playing ).
All the eras of Alice has been covered. From "The Last Temptation" ( his last real album ) to
"School's Out". It has been a real pleasure to hear some classics such "I'm 18" ( especially for
me, my nick is Nr_18 !!! ), "School's out", "Poison", "No More Mr Nice Guy", "Billion Dollars
Babies"...

<P>

There was also a visual show. At a moment, some doctors are coming to catch the "gone mad" Alice
and put him in a straight jacket. After some minutes, Alice get himself free and killed the
doctors. I liked it...

<P>

The show finished with "School's Out" ( and for me, school's out for ever !!! ). It's with a great
smile on our faces that we left the festival ground.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<P>

This smile was soon deleted by the bad surprise we had when we came back to the parking lot ! The
first lucky guys who left the parking before the others had damaged the field. I explain : with the
continuous rain, this field has been transformed in a mega mud-battle-field. So, everyone has been
caught in this trap. All cars were blocked and personaly, we have been blocked until 10:00 am the
morning after !!! 10 hours in a car, waiting a rescue... Damn !!! It has been long.

<P>

Despite it, I find that this festival has been one of the best I've made !!!

<P>

See you next year !!!
