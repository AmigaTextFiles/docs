Terrorvision have to be one of the biggest bands in England at the moment.  They formed the band in
Bradford, England and were originally called 'Spoilt Bratz'.  Soon after they changed the name to
'Terrorvision' and were signed by top record label <b>EMI. </b> They made their first album in December
1992, entitled <a href="forma.html">'Formaldehyde'</a> After this was released, top British Rock
magazine, 'Kerranngg', gave them a lot of stick about it and constantly put down the band.  A few
years later in 1994, they brought out there next album, which was an instant hit.  It included songs
like Middleman, Oblivion and Alice Whats the Matter.  This album was entitled <a
href="howto.html">'How to Make Friends and Influence People'</a>.  From here on, Kerrannggg seemed to
love them.  They were and still are in vertually <i>every </i> issuse of the magazine and made
regular appearances on the

front covers (see picture).  After winning a
few awards, they then bought out their newest album, <a href="Regular.html">'Regular Urban
Survivors'</a>his album was also an instant classic.

Terrorvision's music is very different to that of any other band.  They have their own unique style,
that mixes catchy rythm and a solid beat.  Each song is a classic, and they all have that little
touch to them that no other band has.  In mine, and many other people's opinion the best thing
about their music, is that it is so varied. One minute you can be head banging to a heavy rock song like
'Didnt Bleed Red', the next minute you can chilling out to the melow tones of 'Ten Shades of Grey'.
They have a great mixture of heavy rock, light rock, middle of the road and even easy listening.  If
you take a song like 'Pretend Best Friend', you will find that it even has a great jazz
sound.  Over all...Terrorvision are a <b>great</b> band to follow and listen
to.  Go check them out NOW!!!!!!!!<BR><BR><BR>
