<H2><B>Heads up !!!</B></H2><BR><BR>

Finaly, I'm back on the track with the fifth issue of your favourite magazine : Point and Rock.
Nearly 1 year after the first issue, I am very proud now to show you the <B>BIG</B> improvements
made to the mag.

<P>

As you can see, it has grown ( the size is bigger than previous issues ), but most important,
the format has changed.

<P>

A lot of readers asked me to write the mag in HTML, but I didn't knew how to do it until I wrote
the code for my <A HREF="http://www.ping.be/~pin10450/index.html">Homepage</A>.
It's now a fact, Point & Rock will see the light of day under HTML format. It allows to create a
magazine with a lot of graphics, pictures, making it nicer to read.

<P>

And if you say HTML, you think Internet... So I went to <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/">geocities
</A>to take a place where I could store Point & Rock. Now, not only Amiga users are allowed to read
me, but also PC and Mac, thus the <U>ENTIRE</U> world. What an enhancement !!

<P>

I really hope that this new magazine will please you. I let you discover the changes and I hope to
receive <B>A LOT</B> of reactions from you, dear readers.

<P>

In this issue, you will read concert reports from the gig of Kiss in Gent ( Belgium ), the Graspop
Metal "Mud" Meeting in Dessel ( Belgium ), the usual news, concert dates and album tests, of
course the <A HREF="charts.html">charts</A> ( from this issue, only albums are classed ).

<P>

Now, welcome to my nightmare ( this fifth issue has been hard to be done ), have a nice reading...

<P>
