For non-belgian readers, Channel Zero is a belgian metal band coming from the region of Brussels and
it's a band we can be proud of !!!
Their last album ( the fourth ) is on sale since some months now but I've had not yet the occasion
to test it.

<P>

The first time you listen to the album, you could say "yes, it's a good piece of work", but no more.
And the more you hear the CD, the more you enter in. In fact, this album needs more than a single
audition to be fully understood.

<P>

I've had the occasion to talk to the band recently and I told it to them. They replied me that I was
not the first person to say it. I think it's a sign of maturation !

<P>

The first track of the album ( "Black Fuel" ) is very effective. It has a simplistic guitar riff but
it kills !!! I understand why they decided to title this album with this song.<BR>
I even think that "Love/Hate Satellite" could easily figure on Slayer's "Undisputed Attitude" ( the
singer has the same tone than Araya in this song ).

<P>

"Black Fuel" is quite diversified and I like when it is. But I tell you again to listen it more than
1 time to fully appreciate it...

<P>

Channel Zero begins to get known outside Belgium, so I think that you should have not so many
difficulties to find the album in Europe.

<P>

My quote : 9/10
