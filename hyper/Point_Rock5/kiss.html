This event was the "opening gig" for my festival season of 1997. I had already seen KISS 6 months
ago in Forest National ( Brussels ) and I wanted to see them again, because their show was enormous...
So, when I heard that the <I>BIG CIRCUS</I> was another time in Belgium, I bought my ticket quite
quickly.

<P>

The support band was <I>UNCLE MEAT</I>, a belgian band where a friend of mine is playing. So, it was
the occasion to see them live. I must admit that their gig has not received a lot of enthusiasm from
the crowd. Everyone was there for KISS. But their show pleased me, with the way they play their songs,
you feel that there is a certain cohesion in the band.

<P>

After Uncle Meat, we felt that this event would be special. The temperature was high and it was only
09 p.m. !!! The sentence <I>Hotter than Hell</I> was not a lie !

<P>

Finally, the lights get down, and the giant KISS flag on stage reveals behind it 4 guys playing the
intro of <I>DEUCE</I>. When the flag is removed, I've seen 5 meters in front of me Gene Simmons
pounding his bass in a fury... What a vision !!! Paul Stanley was soooooo beautiful with his black
star on his right eye.

<P>

The crowd was jumping hard, a furious headbanging was in the air. The show was absolutely fabulous.
All from the great era of KISS was there : Ace Frehley launching rockets with his guitar, Gene
Simmons spitting fire at the end of <I>FIRE HOUSE</I>, or blood in the intro of <I>GOD OF THUNDER</I>,
before getting high in the air and playing the entire song at the top of the stage.<BR>
I suggest you to read the article of KISS in Donington in Point & Rock 3 ( only for AMIGA users ) for
the complete track-list.


<P>

In the middle of the show, my friend and I went away from front stage because the temperature was
too high. We took some drinks and get back to enjoy the rest of the show from the sitting place to
have another angle of view.<BR>
We saw Paul Stanley travel in the air across the place to go on another little stage and play
a song while the rest of the band was mainstage. NICE !!!!<BR>
At the end of the show, we saw millions of coloured papers falling from the roof, just like in a
mega party. It was for the song <I>ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE</I> ( and party everyday ) and it was
great to see it.

<P>

KISS finally left stage, leaving us with a great big smile on our face. After the show, I went to
the merchandising place to buy ALIVE! to remember the good moments I've had to the real show...
