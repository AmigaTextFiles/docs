Last saturday, as I was travelling to Aachen in Germany ( I live near this land ), I had in mind
to buy some new records and particularly "One Second" of Paradise Lost.

<P>

I must admit that I don't know what this band was playing ( I have maybe heard 1 or 2 songs from them )
but the press was telling that is new album was good, so I decided to buy it.<BR>
My friend know them and when we decided to put the CD in the player, he has been nicely surprised
by what he heard.

<P>

First of all, it seems that the band has used samples, loops and electronics. But don't be already
horrified and begin to shout "betrayal" !!! It is <B>ABSOLUTELY</B> fabulous... They have created some dark atmospheres and the
music is still depressive. "Another Day" or "Lydia" are examples. But there are also some loud songs
like "Say Just Words" or "Soul Courageous".
Now, the singer is not howling anymore, he is singing and he sings very well. All is so melodic
that is hard to not fall under the charm.

<P>

Here, this album is playing and playing and playing... It's difficult to stop because this new record
is so good. I don't know how the hard fans of Paradise Lost will react, but if they like music, they
will love it.  Following the press, this album is quite different from what the band was used to do.
But it's still Paradise Lost...

<P>

I think that this album deserves the title of "Album of the year", and if it's not already in the
Point and Rock's charts, it will be there soon !!! Go for it, buy it, stole it, listen to it !!!
BTW, if you buy the digipack version, you will have a bonus track called "I despair".

<P>

My quote : 10/10
