This @{"list" link GAMES} contains various secrets (easter eggs) for Sega CD games.  I
have maintained a similar list for the Sega Genesis since October 20,
1991.  I started this list on January 30, 1993.  New versions of this
list include every valid secret I have received, so please do not mail
me requesting "back issues."

Enjoy this list, and please help me out by mailing new secrets to me.
I am mostly looking for undocumented features that can not be
discovered through normal play, such as level selects, invincibility,
and so on.  Because I am not familiar with every Sega CD game, when
submitting a trick please use the current format and describe it
fully.  Also, since I can not test all of the secrets, if you notice a
mistake in one, please mail me the correction (preferably rewriting
the trick completely).  Thanks.

@NODE BATMAN "BATMAN RETURNS (1993)"
@TOC GAMES
( Stage Select ) Select "Options" from the "Batman Returns" title
screen.  Change the game type to "Platform Only".  Now, enter the
following code on the control panel by holding Left on the control pad
and pressing B while Batman's finger is over each number in this
order:  1, 7, 1, 6, 7.  Note that by holding Left and pressing B, you
don't change the status of that item on the screen, but you do enter
the number.  You should hear a louder beep when you enter the last
number to indicate that the stage select code is in place.  Set up the
game options any way you like, then point to the number of the stage
you wish to start at.  Hold Left and press B to start at that stage.
Please be aware that choosing 7 as your starting stage will send you
back to the title screen, since each of the thre game types consists
of five stages plus an ending sequence.

( Skip Stages ) Set the Game Type to "Driving Only", then hold Left
and press B at each of the following numbers:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  You will hear a beep.  Start the game, and you can
skip stages by pressing the C button while the game is paused.
@ENDNODE

@NODE BLACKHOLE "BLACKHOLE ASSAULT  (199?)"
@TOC GAMES
( Secret Game ) Play the game with your name entered as AZY (with no
period).  A secret game called Blackball Assult then comes up.  It is
a two player pong game with a couple variations and a great
soundtrack.

( Kill Opponents Instantly ) Play the game with your name entered as
BIGNET.  When you push the start button on controller 2, your opponent
will die immediately.

( See All Cinema Displays ) If you play the BHA Game as FOMA, Japanese
characters appear.  It is apparently a menu allowing you to select an
animation sequence from the game to watch.

( Invincibility )  Enter the name MUTEKI and play the BHA game.  You
will notice now that the computer can not do damage to you, but you
can still damage him.  However, the last boss can still damage you
sometimes, especially when the timer reaches zero.
@ENDNODE

@NODE COBRA "COBRA COMMAND  (199?)"
@TOC GAMES
( Training Mode ) Press start at the title screen.  When you see the
words "Game Start" and "Config Mode," press Up, Down, Left, and Right
[and Start?].  You'll hear a short explosion sound.  You will now be
able to use the "Training" difficulty setting, which will let you
continue at the point you had reached when you were killed instead of
being sent back to the beginning of the stage.  This also apparently
adds several other new difficulties.

( Stage Select ) Press START at the title screen.  When you see the
words "Game Start" and "Config Mode", press Up, Down, Left, Right,
Right, Up.  You should hear an explosion sound the first time you hit
Right in this sequence (you've enabled training mode as described
above).  You'll hear another explosion when you finish the sequence.
When you reach the screen that says "New York -- Stage 1", you should
be able to press Right and Left on the control pad to change your
starting level.  Once the action starts, you can skip to the end of
the current stage simply by pressing START.  Press START in the final
stage, and you'll skip to the ending credits.

( Hexadecimal Code ) With the stage-select code in place, pressing A,
B, and C at the same time will give you a screenful of hexadecimal
code that overlays the action.  This trick will no doubt provide you
with hours of entertainment.
@ENDNODE

@NODE FINAL "FINAL FIGHT CD (199?)"
@TOC GAMES
( Rapid-Fire Mode ) Enter the option menu and highlight the word
"exit" at the bottom of the screen.  While holding down A, B, and
Right, press START.  All of the action buttons will have rapid fire.
@ENDNODE

@NODE GOLDEN "GOLDEN AXE  (1992)"
@TOC GAMES
( Stage Select ) To start on any of the levels in Golden Axe, go into
Arcade Mode.  Now push  to the Lower Left (the characters will spin on
the skeleton's hand) and press B and START at the same time.  A number
will appear in the top left hand corner.  Press Up and Down to adjust
what level to start on, then select you character and start the game.
@ENDNODE

@NODE MAKE "MAKE MY VIDEO Discs  (199?)"
@TOC GAMES
( Hidden Footage )  This is known to work with "Marky Mark and the
Funky Bunch," "C+C Music Factory," and "Kris Kross."  It will probably
work with any title in the series.  At the "U-Direct" menu, press A,
B, C, Right to watch behind-the-scenes footage.  During any of the
footage, press Start to call up another sequence, the "Annals of
Digital Pictures," in which you see the creation of the "Make My
Video..." concept in 1986.
@ENDNODE

@NODE NIGHT "NIGHT TRAP  (199?)"
@TOC GAMES
( Hidden Footage ) Watch the credits at the end of the game.  When the
words "In Memory of Stephen D. Hassenfeld" appear on the screen, press
Up, A, A, A, A, A.  You'll be shown some footage that was shot in
Pawtucket, Rhode Island in December of 1986 when Tom Zito and company
first demonstrated a prototype of the ill-fated NEMO game system for a
group of Hasbro executives.  Milton Bradley's Larry Bernstein is seen
playing Scene of the Crime, which eventually became Night Trap.
@ENDNODE

@NODE REVENGE "REVENGE OF SHINOBI  (1992)"
@TOC GAMES
( Unlimited Shurikens ) For unlimited shurikens, set the number of
shurikens on the Options Screen to 00 until the zeros turn into an
infinity symbol.
@ENDNODE

@NODE ROAD "ROAD AVENGERS  (199?)"
@TOC GAMES
( Level select ) From game start screen press UP to options (important
not to move down to options) and press start.  With the cursor on the
players option press the A button 6 times, and you will hear a beep.
Exit the options screen and start the game and you will be asked to
select the level.
@ENDNODE

@NODE SILPHEED "SILPHEED (1993)"
@TOC GAMES
( Stage Select ) During the intro, press Down, Down, Up, Up, Right,
Left, Right, Left, A, B, START.  There will be a stage-select option
on the title screen.  Pick a stage and press A to start there.  If you
pick a number higher than 12, you'll see one of the animated
intermissions.

( Shield Recharge ) During the intro, press Right, Left, A, Right, Up,
C, B, Down, Left, B, A, Up, START.  You can max out your shield at any
time by pressing A on controller 2.

( Voice Test ) At the title screen, highlight "Option".  Press and
hold buttons A, B, and C on controller two and press START on
controller one.  "Sound Test" will be replaced with "Voice Test".
Press left and right to choose a voice, and press A, B, or C to play
it.  Pressing Left or Right on controller two alters the speed and
pitch of the voices.

( Infinite Continues ) When down to your last continue, leave the
cursor on the words "Continue 01" and wait for the game to go back to
the introduction.  When the demo sequence begins, press Right, Up, A,
B, C, Left, Left, Down, C, A, START.  You'll find that the number of
continues shown on the title screen has been boosted to ten.  You can
repeat this process when you get down to your last continue again.

( Mania Mode ) During the intro, on controller two press B, B, A, C,
Up, Left, Right, Down, Up, A.  Press START on controller one.  You'll
know the cheat is in place if your score reads "00001" when you start
the game.  You're now in "mania Mode", a difficulty setting that's
even tougher than the "Hard Rank" on the option screen.
@ENDNODE

@NODE SOL-FEACE "SOL-FEACE  (1992)"
@TOC GAMES
(Level Select) On the title screen when it says "push start button,"
press A, B, C, A, B, C, B, C, B, A.  You will hear a short explosion.
Press start.  Go to the configuration menu and you will be able select
the level at which you want to start.

( Skip Level ) Do the level select.  Then, when in any level, at any
time, if you hit all three buttons (A,B,C) you will automatically skip
to the next level.

(99 lives and Invincibility) Do the level select.  Move the cursor to
options in the configuration menu.  Then push right on the D button
and then press A several times.  Eventually, the word "MY99" will
appear on the options menu.  "MY99" will give you 99 lives.  If you
continue to press A while pushing right on the D button, the word
"MUTEK1" will appear on the options menu.  "MUTEK1" will make your
ship invincible.  (There may be more special codes.)
