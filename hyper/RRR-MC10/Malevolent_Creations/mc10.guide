    We take absolutely no responsibility whatever the buttons below may
 cause to your health, sanity, grandma or something else, if you press 'em.
    If you are not interested in your life as it is now, just go ahead.
                    You will never be the same. Never.

                           YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

 @{" Alusleikki " system "data/0a.dat data/101.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Sector QB-723a, dominated by Ghosts and Evil Eyes, is certainly no
 place for a human cruiser like this. Even if their Plexonium armor
 can keep the spirits outside, it's useless against the quick and
 cunning alien predator vessel that runs rounds around the big and
 clumsy earthling. As a last result, they try to bomb the alien with
 loads of bio-waste, but unfortunately the blasted craft is invulnerable
 to such desperate attacks. It is clear now, their time is running out.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Die Boote " system "data/0a.dat data/102.dat blank reltime 6"}

 Deep in the dark depths of the inner space, near the core of earth
 itself, are these hordes of submarines battling against each other.
 Their task is to win the greatest of all prices, the mastery of the
 Earth itself. However, there are the Other Things. The Other Things
 that lurk at the bottom of the sea. Being true masters of the earth
 and the filth that lives on its surface, they tolerate no aggression
 towards their perpetual domain.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Joulun Henki " system "data/0a.dat data/103.dat blank reltime 5"}

 As you can see, the Spirit of Christmas itself approves JIP's
 another Christmas-related multimedia masterpiece. Even the stars
 rejoice and dance at the xmas time.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Kasvukivut " system "data/0a.dat data/104.dat blank reltime 5"}

 This is about the mental and physical pains a finnish girl has
 to go trough while she is growing into adulthood. Yes, the vikings,
 the trees and the rainbow. They are all there.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Metal Show " system "data/0a.dat data/105.dat blank reltime 3"}

 The scorching sun boils the blood of the pitiful humans deposited
 on this test ground. There is no water, just gray-hot metal burning
 their feet. At last, they perish, and the Trees that are alive suck
 the last life essences out of them. There will be no rest after Death,
 as the souls ascend as tormented ghosts to the great soul-pool at
 the heavens above.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Voodoo Dreams " system "data/0a.dat data/106.dat blank reltime 4"}

 Modern VooDoo is a horrible thing to experience. It's not anything
 like these stupid dolls that are stuck with needles, or brainless
 negro zombies running around with bloodshot eyes. Instead, Modern
 Voodoo Dreams feature the latest in the Haunt business. Ghosts like
 Tie-fighters, invisible flying strawberry anomalities, and ofcourse
 your tortured String of Life. Balanced on it there stands the C.PT5
 Cone, collecting your stress output and transforming it into its
 own weight. Enough stress and your string of life will snap, leaving
 you a vegetable-like hulk of human waste...
