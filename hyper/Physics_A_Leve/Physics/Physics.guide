@node PQU "Foundation: Physical Quantities and Units"
· All quantities in physics consist of a numerical magnitude and a unit.  All units can be expressed in terms of the SI base units:

Mass:                Kilogram (kg)
Length:              Metre (m)
Time:                Second (s)
Current:             Ampere (A)
Temperature:         Kelvin (K)     temperature/K = temperature/°C + 273
Amount of substance: Mole (mol)

· If you expand the units for each term of an equation in terms of the base units, you can check whether an equation is balanced (homogeneous).

· Instead of ×10¬ you can use:

 prefix     x

atto  (a): -18
femto (f): -15
pico  (p): -12
nano  (n): -9
micro (µ): -6
milli (m): -3
centi (c): -2
deci  (d): -1
kilo  (k):  3
mega  (M):  6
giga  (G):  9
tera  (T):  12

· When dealing with quantities of atoms and molecules, it is conventional to measure mass and number relative to carbon-12 atom.

· The relative molecular mass of a substance is the mass of a molecule of a substance divided by 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom

» Moles = @{u}         Mass          @{uu}
          Relative Molecular Mass

» Atoms = Moles × Avogadro's Number (6.02 × 10²³)

· The mole is the amount of substance containing the same number of @{"atoms" link Atom} or molecules as the number of atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12.  This number of atoms is called the Avogadro constant, L=6.02×10²³ mol-¹

· Scalar quantities have magnitude only:

length, speed, mass, density, energy, power, temperature, charge and potential difference.

· Vector quantities have a direction:

displacement, force, torque, velocity, acceleration, momentum, electric current and electric field.

· To add vectors, draw them in a line.  The line joining start directly to finish is the resultant.
@endnode

@node Kine "Foundation: Kinematics"

· Equations:

» Average Velocity = @{u}displacement@{uu}
                         time

» Acceleration = @{u}change in velocity@{uu}
                        time

· Equations of motion:

where @{b}u@{ub}=initial velocity
      @{b}v@{ub}=final velocity
      @{b}s@{ub}=displacement
      @{b}t@{ub}=time
      @{b}a@{ub}=acceleration

» v = u + at
» s = ut + ½at²
» s = vt - ½at²
» s = @{u}v + u@{uu} t
        2
» v²= u² + 2as

· Graphs:

» The gradient of a displacement-time graph gives the speed.

» The gradient of a velocity-time graph gives the acceleration.

» The area beneath a velocity-time graph gives the distance travelled.

· For projectiles, the horizontal and vertical components of velocity can be treated independently.  In the absence of air resistance, the horizontal component of velocity is constant while the vertical component of velocity downwards increases at a rate of 9.81 m/s²

· An object falling freely in air accelerates until a terminal velocity is reached.  At this velocity there is no acceleration because the force of air resistance, upwards, on the objects is equal and opposite to the weight of the object.
@endnode

@node Dyna "Foundation: Dynamics"

· @{"Mass" link PQU} is a scalar property of an object and does not change as it moves from place to place.  Mass is a measure of the reluctance of the object to accelerate.  It is measured in kilograms.

· Momentum is a vector, measured in Newton seconds (Ns) or kg m/s:

» Momentum = mass × velocity

· Newton's laws:

» Newton's first law:

If no resultant force acts on it, a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body moving with constant velocity will continue to move with the same constant velocity.

» Newton's second law:

The rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the total force applied to it.

» Newton's third law:

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, of the same type and acting on a different object

· Newton's first two laws in equation form:

force = mass × acceleration
ft = mv-mu = impulse (in Ns)

· The law of conservation of momentum

» In a closed system, total momentum is conserved:
  > momentum before = momentum after

· In an elastic collision, both momentum and @{"kinetic energy" link WEP} are conserved.  In an inelastic collision, only momentum is conserved.
@endnode

@node Forces "Foundation: Forces"
· If the resultant force on an object is zero, then the object is in equilibrium:

»   up forces = down forces
» left forces = right forces
»   clockwise = anticlockwise

· The centre of gravity of an object is the point through which the entire weight of the object may be considered to act.

· Moments:

» The moment of a force = force × perpendicular distance of the pivot
                                  from the line of action of the force.

· A pair of equal and opposite forces not acting in the same straight line is called a @{i}couple@{ui}.

· The turning effet of a couple is called a @{i}torque@{ui}:

» The torque of a couple = one of the forces × perpendicular distance
                                               between the forces
@endnode

@node WEP "Foundation: Work, Energy and Power"
· Equation:

» Work done = force × distance moved, in Joules.

· Energy is the stored ability to do work.  Equations:

» Gravitational potential energy = mass × gravity × height = mgh

» Kinetic energy = ½ × mass × velocity² = ½mv²

· In an elastic @{"collision" link Dyna}, no kinetic energy is converted to other forms.
  In an inelastic collision, kinetic energy is converted.

· For a totally elastic collision:

» The relative velocity of approach = the relative velocity of separation

· Power is the rate of doing work:

» power = work done ÷ time = force × velocity

· The law of conservation of energy:

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, just changed from one form into another.

· Efficiency equation:

» Efficiency = @{u}   energy/power from the system    @{uu}
               energy/power supplied to the system

· The kilowatt hour is a convenient unit of energy, equal to a power of 1kW being used for 1 hour:

» 1 kWh = 3 600 000 J
@endnode

@node Wave "Foundation: Waves"
· Frequency (f, in hertz [Hz]): The number of vibrations per second.

· Wavelength (Ø @{"lambda" link MathX}, in metres [m]): The distance from any point on a wave to another exactly similar point (eg. crest to crest).

· Displacement (x, in metres [m]): The distance of a point on the wave from its undisturbed position.

· Amplitude (a, in metres [m]): The maximum displacement of any point on the wave from its undisturbed position.

· Periodic time (T, in seconds [s]): The time taken for one complete vibration.

» T = @{u}1@{uu}
      f

· National frequency of vibration depends on: size (smaller-higher), mass (lighter-higher) and stiffness (stiffer-higher).

· Mechanical waves require a medium to travel through.

· Progressive waves move through a material or vacuum.

· There are two types of waves: longitudinal and transverse:

Longitudinal waves have vibrations along the wave direction.
Transverse waves vibrate across the wave direction.

· The wave equation:

Wave speed = frequency × wavelength

· When a wave is reflected from a fixed boundary there is a phase change of 180°.

· Transverse waves can be polarised (the vibrations in one plane only)

· The laws of reflection:

» angle of incidence = angle of reflection

» The object, the point of reflection and the image all lie in the same plane.

· The refractive index (n) is the ratio of speed in free space to speed in the medium:

» free space ÷ medium
» real depth ÷ apparrent depth

· Snell's law of refraction:

i = angle of incidence, r = angle of refractive, n = refractive index.

» n = @{u}sin i@{uu}
      sin r

· The crical angle (C) is the angle of incidence for which the angle of refraction is 90°:

» Sin C = @{u}1@{uu}
          n

· For angles of incidence above the critical angle, total internal refraction occurs. (used in fibre optics)

@node Elec "Foundation: Electricity"
· An electric current is a flow of charged particles (usually electrons).

· The coulomb (C) is the @{"SI unit" link PQU} of charge, Q.

· Current, I, is rate of flow of charge: 

» Charge = current × time ... Q=It

· The potential difference between two points is a measure of the difference in the energy electrons at these points, and is defined as the work done in moving a unit positive charge (+1C) from one point to the other.

· Resistance, R, is measured in ohms (§ "omega") is defined by the equation:

» R = @{u}V@{uu}
      I

· Kirchoff's first law:

The currents at a junction are conserved.  (or the current is split between the branches)

· In a series circuit, potential difference across each component = total p.d. and current is the same at all points in the circuit.

· In a parallel circuit, p.d. in each branch are equal, and currents in each branch add up to main current.

· Two resistors (R¹, R²) connected in series have total resistance (R):

» R = R¹ + R²

· Two resistors (R¹, R²) connected in parallel have total resistance (R):

@node Atom "Foundation: Atomic Structure"
· The alpha-particle (þ-particle) scattering experiment provides evidence for the existance of a small, positively charged nucleus at the centre of the atom.  The atom consists of a small, relatively heavy central nucleus composed of protons (with a positive charge +e) and neutrons (with no charge).  The nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of orbiting electrons (with a negative charge -e).  An atom is an electrically neutral particle.  »»@{"DIAGRAM" system Multiview AtomPic}««

· The number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom is called its @{i}nucleon/mass number@{ui} (A)

· The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called its @{i}proton number@{ui} (Z)

· The number of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom is called its @{i}neutron number@{ui} (N)

·The nucleon number is the sum of the proton number and neutron number:

» A = Z + N

· Isotopes are atoms of the same element (with the same proton number) but different neutron numbers.

· Different isotopes (or nuclides, if referring to the nucleus only) can be represented by the notation:

@node Oscil "Basic 1: Oscillations and Vibrations"
· Free oscillations are when an object vibrates at its own natural frequency.

· Forced oscillations happen when an object is forced to vibrate at a frequency other than its own.

· Some display a particular form of movement called @{i}simple harmonic motion@{ui}.  For these systems, a @{"graph" link Kine} of displacement against time is a smooth sine curve.

· Damping reduces the @{"amplitude" link Wave} of oscillations.  Critical damping is where the oscillating mass returns to rest after one oscillation.

· When an oscillating system is forced to vibrate close to its natural @{"frequency" link Wave}, resonance occurs and the @{"amplitude" link Wave} of oscillations increase greatly.

· Uses of resonance: musical instruments, microwave cooking

@node Super "Basic 1: Superposition of Waves"
· Waves are a periodic disturbance by which energy is transferred from place to place.

· When two or more waves coincide, we can deduce their net effect using the principle of superposition of waves.  The resultant disturbance at a point is found by adding up the separate disturbances of the individual waves.

· Constructive interference: Two waves arrive in phase at the same point

· Destructive interference: Two waves with same amplitude arrive at a point ½ a cycle out of phase.

· Stationary waves are established when two indentical waves travelling in opposite directions meet.  Usually this happens when one wave is a reflection of the other.

· A stationary wave has a characteristic pattern of nodes (no displacement) and anti-nodes (maximum displacement).

· The distance between nodes is ½ a wavelength

· Diffraction happens when waves arrive at a gap in the barrier, and spread into the space beyond.  The effect is greatest when the width of the gap is equal to the wavelength of the waves.

@node ElecVolts "Basic 1: Electrical Voltages"
· A voltage is needed to push an electric current around a circuit

· The voltage provided by a battery or power supply is an electromotive force (e.m.f. "E")

· Electric charge is given energy by the e.m.f. of the supply; it loses energy as it passes through the potential difference (p.d.) across components in the circuit, given by:

» W (energy) = Q (charge) × V (potential difference)
» W = QE, where E is electromotive force

· A volt is a joule per coulomb.

· Because a source of e.m.f. has internal resistance, this must be included in calculations of current and voltage.

» V = E - Ir, where : @{b}V@{ub} is terminal p.d.
                      @{b}E@{ub} is e.m.f.
or V = E - lost volts @{b}I@{ub} is current
                      @{b}r@{ub} is internal resistance

· If you draw a graph of V against I:

» The gradient gives you -r (negative internal resistance)
» The y-intercept gives you E (e.m.f.)

· A potential divider uses two resistors or a variable resistor to provide a variable source of p.d.

@node ElecMag1 "Basic 1: Electromagnetism"
· Magnetic fields are produced by permanent magnets and by electric currents.  We can represent them by lines of force.

· The field of a current in a wire can be strengthened by forming it into a coil, and by adding a ferrous core.  This is the principle of electromagnets.

· Magnetic field is pictured as going from north to south

· The north pole of a solenoid, and the magnetic field around a straight wire can be found using the right-hand grip rule:

» solenoid - Thumb:   North
             Fingers: Current

» wire -     Thumb:   Current
                      Magnetic field

· When a current flows across a magnetic field, there is an interaction between the two fields.

· The direction of the resulting force is given by Fleming's left hand rule:

» With thumb, first finger and second finger at right angles, point each in the direction of the following:

@{b}F@{ub}irst Finger  - (Magnetic) Field
Se@{b}c@{ub}ond Finger - Current
Thu@{b}m@{ub}b         - Motion

@node Phase "Basic 1: Phases of Matter"
· Matter can exist in three phases: solid, liquid and gas.

» Gas:    Very far apart, no order, moving fast.

· The kinetic model of matter allows us to explaing macroscopic properties (eg. density, pressure, specific heat and latent heat) in terms of the behaviour of the molecules:

· The pressure in a fluid is given by:

» p=@{i}P@{ui}gh

(pressure = density × gravity × height)

Measured in Pascals (Pa), 1 Pa = 1 N/m²

· The specific heat capacity c of a substance is the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg by 1°C

· The energy transferred in raising the temperature of a substance is given by:

» E = mc@{u}^@{uu}¤

(Energy = mass × specific heat capacity × temperature change)

· The specific latent heat @{b}L@{ub} of a substance is the energy required to change the state of 1 kg of the substance.

· k is the spring constant: the force required to stretch the spring by a metre.

· Stress is the load per cross-sectional area of a wire

» stress = load ÷ cross-sectional area, in Pa

· Strain is the fractional increase in the length of a wire

» strain = extension ÷ original length, ratio sometimes given as % (× 100)

· Young's modulus is the stiffness of a material:

» Young's modulus = stress ÷ strain, Pa

· Beyond the elastic (where the material returns to its original shape) limit, brittle materials break (they have a non-crystalline structure)

· Ductile materials show plastic behaviour and become permanently deformed (they have a crystalline (orderly) structure.)

· The behaviour of a material can be related to its underlying crystalline (@{"particles" link Atom} arranged in an orderly way) or amorphous (irregular) structure.

· The strain energy in a deformed material can be found from the area under the force-extension graph.

» strain energy (in J) = ½Fx

· Electron diffraction can be explained by thinking of electrons as waves, instead of particles.

· Electrons behave as particles when they interact with matter.

· For light of frequency f, photons have energy hf, where h is the Planck constant: 6.63×10-³4

» E = hf

· The photoelectric effect: when UV rays hit a piece of metal at (or higher than) the @{i}threshold frequency@{ui}, it causes electrons to be ejected.

· A photon of light whose frequency equals the threshold frequency has just enough energy to release a weakly bound electron.  A more energetic photon may release a faster-moving electron.

· Line spectra arise for isolated atoms.  An electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower one, and the difference in energy is emitted as a photon.

· Other equations:

» hf = ø+Emax      where ø is the Work Function - ø=hfo
» hf = ø+½mv²max   (min. amount of energy required to release an electron)
» E = (hc)/Ø, where c is the wave speed
» Ø = h/p, where p is the momentum of the particle

· Nuclear reactions can be represented by a balanced nuclear equations.  In any such reaction, the following quantities are conserved: @{"proton number Z" link Atom}, @{"nucleon number A" link Atom}, and (mass plus energy).

· In order to relate mass changes to energy changes, we use Einstein's equation.

» E = mc²

· Nuclear fission: A neutron collides with a atom, causing it to split

· Nuclear fussion: Two atoms combine

· The most stable atoms are the middle size

· The variation of binding energy per nucleon shows that energy is released when light nuclei undergo fusion and when heavier nuclei undergo fission, because these processes increase the binding energy per nucleon and hence result in more stable nuclides.

· The most strongly ionising, and hence the least penetrating is þ.  The least strongly ionising is Y.

· The half-life t½ of a nuclide is the average time taken for half of the nuclei in a sample to decay.

· The probability that an individual nucleus will decay in a particular time interval is called the decay constant, Ø
eg. Ø = 0.2h-¹ (probability of decay in 1 hour)

· These two quantities are related by:

» Ø= - ln ½ ÷ (t½)

· We can represent the exponential decrease of a quantity by an equation of the form:

         -Øt
» X = Xoe

@node Grav "Basic 2: Gravity"
· The force of gravity is an attractive force between any two objects because of their masses.

· We can describe the gravitational effect of an object in terms of the gravitational field around it.  The strength of the field at a point is the force exerted on unit mass placed in the field.

· Newton's law gives us the force between two masses (m¹ and m²):

G is the universal gravitational constant (6.67 × 10-¹¹ Nm²kg-²)

» F = -G @{u}m¹m²@{uu}
          r²

· Field strength at distance r from mass m:

» g = -G @{u}m @{uu}
         r²

· On or near the surface of the Earth, the field is uniform: g is approximately constant; its value is equal to the acceleration of free fall.

· An object in a gravitional field has gravitational potential energy.  The potential ø at a point in the field tells us the potential energy of unit mass placed at the point.  It is calculated from the work done in bringing unit mass from infinity (where ø=0) to the point.

» ø = -G @{u}m@{uu}

· An electric field is a field of force, and can be represented by field lines.

· Direction of field lines is positive (+) towards negative (-) or less positive.

· Field lines are closer together if there is larger @{"potential difference" link Elec}

· The strength of the field is the force acting on unit charge placed at a point in the field.

· The @{"potential" link Gravity} at a point is the @{"work done" link WEP} in bringing unit charge from infinity to that point.

· In a uniform field (eg. between two parallel charged plates) the force on a charge is the same at all points; the strength of the field is given by:

» E=-V/d

· A point charge gives rise to a speherical field; 

» field strength E=Q/(4ÐEod²)
» potential V=Q/(4ÐEod)

· These relationships are derived from coulomb's law for the force between two charged particles:

» F=Q¹Q²/(4ÐEod²)

· Field strength is numerically equal to the potential gradient at a point.
