    We take absolutely no responsibility whatever the buttons below may
 cause to your health, sanity, grandma or something else, if you press 'em.
    If you are not interested in your life as it is now, just go ahead.

 @{" 101 Damnations " system "data/0a.dat data/91.dat blank reltime 5"}

 This is the VooDooCon(R) Damnator DM-250. Watch as the doomed humans
 are blasted into oblivion, while their brain contents are oozed into
 the humongous databanks of the MotherBrain! Take a note of the
 amazing processing speed, which is somewhat equal to 1+384E. Now all
 this and more can be yours for the pitiful price of 7.33k zorkmids.

 @{" Alces Caelestis " system "data/0a.dat data/92.dat blank reltime 10"}

 Pick up your latin dictionary in order to retrieve the very details
 concerning the Alces Caelestis phenomenon. For the most viewers,
 this being seems relaxed and happy, bouncing around merrily. But
 behold, if your karma is on the wrong side, if the gods are mad at you,
 if your morning porridge was left uneaten... a terrible fate
 awaits you... in the form of blunt teeth it comes to bite you,
 and in the form of scratching mycelium it strangles you!
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Ghostly Genesis " system "data/0a.dat data/93.dat blank reltime 5"}

 The latest breakthrough of "modern" human science is certainly the fact
 that aliens and ghosts are one. Incubated in the centers of religious
 beliefs, fed with the psychic powers of the weak hunams (as the Spathii
 call them), a ghost entity is born. Devouring the rest of the foolish
 brains self-sacrificed in worship of nonexisting gods, the entity is
 powerful enough to spawn four aliens. Four aliens to explore the
 skies, four aliens to abduct humans. Four aliens to join the endless
 masses of aliens. Endless masses of aliens to rule the universe.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Imaginatio " system "data/0a.dat data/94.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Not many know what means the mystic human word "portzebie" - neither
 do we, and we consider this matter just as one of the unimportant things
 in the human analysis. However, in this famous NgmAgh-QerT experiment
 we can clearly see how average human panics when deposited on the test
 area. There is much to develop before humans are ready for the
 challenging task a human was designed for - the so called self-service.
 In case you didn't know, in the procedure the individual flavours and
 prepares himself, and willingly ascends to the Trophy Bone Pit, where
 he/she is finally devoured by the malicious Kohr-Ah.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" MuurahaisTorni " system "data/0a.dat data/95.dat blank reltime 6"}

 In this tower constructed of human bone mass and long-gone chlorophyl,
 lies the power of the Ant Empire. It's constructed with unbelievable
 engineering skills, it's built on the smoking ruins of the human
 civilization and it rises higher than Fyag-Naa'gh! This is something
 to admire. This is what the earth was eradicated for.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Turistimatka Utopiaan " system "data/0a.dat data/96.dat blank reltime 6"}

 You surely remember Utopia, the place of dreams and happiness,
 the site of love and freedom (and everything else) which we featured
 in some Malevolent Creations edition. Time has passed now, winds
 have changed and Utopia has becomed a tourist trap. To the letter.
 Can you see the sadistic smile on the face of the guide? Can
 you see the pyramids, the flying little critters on the right?
 They are for real. Everything else is only hoax, an illusion.
 Of their fate only this I say: They are going to go beyond.

$VER: JL_GREEN.TXT v09.09.1995


                     From the handbook for Humans


                           HOW TO BE GREEN


    For all time mankind has been trying to push forward
    the limits of humanity. Victory after victory a new
    struggle awaits, never far away. The latest (and
    up-to-date certainly the hardest) challenge facing us
    is the one of being green - green like our Ur-Quan masters.

        Oh, the glorious Ur-Quan conquerors

    Green is the colour of the Ur-Quan. Shading from icky-green
    to grass green, partly so deep and rich in colour that one
    could think of it as perpetual... Compared to the sad human lives,
    entwined in emotion and instinct, the Ur-Quan truly seem immortal.
    During the twenty thousand years on the Path of Now and Forever,
    the Ur-Quan have watched lower species rise from the seas, they have
    seen the stars burst nova and gaias collapse, without emotion they've
    stared as the other races have crawled into their deaths.
        Grim in mind, violent in action - each Ur-Quan having four
    green tentacles endlessly searching for new flesh to squirm in
    their grasp. Three are the bulging eyes on the Ur-Quan body,
    gazing into the weak souls of its adversaries.

        Oh, the glorious Ur-Quan...

    the chant goes on and on. Scientists are fascinated
    by their superior technology and its greatest green invention,
    the phallic Dreadnought. Its firepower is unbelievable:
    less than four blasts from its plasma-cannons will surely
    wreck the hull of any starship, while mere three shots are
    enough to finish an Alliance vessel of galaxy-class.
        But most feared of all of the devastating traits of
    the Ur-Quan Dreadnought is the capability of launching
    fighters. Countless is the amount of those little vessels
    bursting out from the belly of the Dreadnought, unheard are
    the screams of the enemy crew while their ship is toasted
    into its compound components.

    To be green - to be Ur-Quan - to rule the space and time
    and "all between" is unfortunately denied from mankind
    save no one. The final grandslam can't be won by us,
    for one born human can never be Ur-Quan, and our green,
    illustrous masters will hear no human whine. Complain,
    and they will send their brothers, the merciless
    Kohr-Ah, to cleanse the earth of its worthless slime.

    Dye your hue into the deepest green, if you will, blur your
    optical sensors with green contact lenses and think green
    thoughts... but you can never be green enough!
